BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig> is a soil bacterium that establishes a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with the host plants medicago sativa  and medicago truncatula . these plants are not only agriculturally important, but are also key model organisms for studying the symbiotic interaction between rhizobial bacteria and their plant hosts. the goals of this study are to increase our understanding of this process and provide practical insights that may lead to the production of more efficient symbiotic strains of rhizobia. increasing the efficiency of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is important in that it reduces the need for industrial production of nitrogen fertilizers, which is extremely costly in terms of petroleum and natural gas. in  <dig>  the us applied  <dig> million tons of industrially-produced nitrogen fertilizer to crops  <cit> . fertilizers continue to be used to increase yields of legume crops  <cit> , demonstrating that there is considerable room for improvement in these symbiotic associations.

s. meliloti fixes nitrogen in root nodules formed by the host plant, converting dinitrogen gas to ammonia. the development of these nodules requires that several signals be exchanged between the plant and the rhizobial bacteria. flavonoid compounds produced by host plants signal s. meliloti to produce lipochitooligosaccharides called nod factors   <cit> . nf activates multiple responses in host plants, including tight curling of root hairs that traps bacterial cells within the curl, and cell divisions in the root cortex, which establish the nodule primordium  <cit> . the bacteria invade and colonize the roots through structures called infection threads, which originate from microcolonies of bacteria trapped in the curled root hair cells  <cit> . new infection threads initiate at each cell layer, eventually delivering the bacteria to the inner plant cortex  <cit> . there, the rhizobial bacteria are endocytosed by root cortical cells within individual compartments of host-cell membrane origin  <cit> . within these compartments, signals provided by the plant and the low-oxygen environment induce the bacteria to differentiate into a form called a “bacteroid”, and to begin expressing nitrogenase, the nitrogen-fixing enzyme, and other factors that are required for the symbiosis  <cit> .

rhizobial fixation of dinitrogen requires not only the expression of nitrogenase , but also the assembly of cofactors and large inputs of energy and reductant  <cit> . nitrogen fixation also requires a nitrogenase reductase, encoded by nifh <cit> ; iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis proteins, encoded by nifbnife and nife; and electron transfer flavoproteins and ferredoxins   <cit> . bacteroids also increase their respiration rate, increasing the expression of the fixnoqp cytochrome c oxidase operons  <cit> .

many of the proteins required for nitrogen fixation are tightly regulated by oxygen-sensing systems and are produced by rhizobial bacteria only when they encounter a low-oxygen environment  <cit> . nitrogenase and some of the other factors involved in nitrogen fixation are extremely oxygen-sensitive  <cit> , thus their expression under inappropriate conditions would be ineffective. even under microaerobic conditions, most rhizobial bacteria are not capable of nitrogen fixation in the free-living state  <cit> . the reasons for this are not completely understood, though it is known that legumes of the inverted repeat-lacking clade , such as alfalfa and m. truncatula, which form indeterminate-type nodules, impose a specific differentiation program on the intracellular bacteria, most likely through the activity of plant-produced bioactive peptides  <cit> . bacteroids also receive nutrients from the host plant, such as the carbon source malate  <cit> . multiple bacterial cellular processes and differentiation programs contribute to the success of the symbiosis with host plants, and one of our goals is to use comparative genomics to predict previously uncharacterized s. meliloti open reading frames  that may be involved in these processes, to test these predictions, and understand the mechanisms involved. in other bacterial species, comparative genomics of bacterial strains has been useful in finding new genes that are involved in metabolic pathways and in identifying virulence factors that distinguish pathogenic strains from commensal strains . in this study, a comparison of orfs from nitrogen-fixing, plant-host nodulating rhizobia with closely-related non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria has identified orfs that are expressed by sinorhizobium meliloti within host plant nodules.

methods
genome comparisons
searches were conducted at the department of energy joint genome institute’s integrated microbial genomes website, http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi. all of the genomes to be compared were selected from the genome display under the “find genomes” tab . the selected genomes were saved. the “phylogenetic profiler” for single genes was used to find genes in sinorhizobium/ensifer meliloti with homologs in the genomes to be intersected and without homologs in the genomes to be subtracted . the searches were conducted at 20–80% identity and the complete data output is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

bacterial strains and growth conditions
s. meliloti  <dig> strains were grown at 30°c in either lbmc , or 1/ <dig> lb-7% sucrose medium, with 1 mm mgso <dig> and  <dig>  mm cacl <dig>  or m <dig> salts-10% sucrose medium, supplemented with 1 μg/ml biotin  <cit> . bacterial plates contained  <dig> % bactoagar. selections against strains carrying the sacb gene in the plasmid pk19mobsac were performed in m <dig> supplemented with 10% w/v sucrose or 1/ <dig> lb-7% sucrose  <cit> . appropriate antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for s. meliloti strains: streptomycin  <dig> or 1000 μg/ml; neomycin 200 μg/ml. e. coli strains were grown at 37°c in lb medium  <cit> , with appropriate antibiotics used at the following concentrations: kanamycin 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol 10 μg/ml.

construction of s. meliloti mutant strains
mutant strains of s. meliloti  <dig> with disruptions in orfs described in table  <dig> were constructed by amplifying internal orf fragments using phusion polymerase  and cloning into the plasmid pjh <dig>  which carries a neomycin/kanamycin resistance marker   <cit> . insertion of the pjh <dig> plasmid also creates transcriptional fusions to the uida β-glucuronidase  gene. non-disrupting gus insertions of some orfs  were constructed by amplifying the entire orf or operon and cloning the product into pjh <dig>  and conjugating into s. meliloti. deletion mutant strains were constructed by amplifying fragments flanking the orf to be deleted and cloning the fragments into the sacb gene-containing suicide vector pk19mobsac  <cit> .  mutant strains are listed in table  <dig>  primers  and restriction enzymes  used for amplification and cloning of disruption, non-disrupting insertion, or deletion fragments are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  plasmids were mobilized into s. meliloti by triparental conjugation as described previously  <cit> . s. meliloti exconjugants were selected on lbmc medium containing 200 μg/ml neomycin and 1000 μg/ml streptomycin. unmarked deletion strains were selected for loss of the sacb gene carried by the pk19mobsac vector by plating neomycin-resistant exconjugants to either m <dig> salts--10% sucrose medium or 1/ <dig> lb-7% sucrose medium. strains constructed by phage ϕm <dig> transduction of plasmid insertions into s. meliloti  <dig> are denoted in the tables as “xsd”. transductions using phage ϕm <dig> were performed according to published protocols  <cit> . for each mutant produced, at least two strains were isolated. for some of the mutants, including those which carry an unmarked orf deletion, multiple independent isolates were obtained by selecting exconjugants from multiple independent conjugations. for most of the mutants carrying an insertion of the pjh <dig> plasmid, the independent isolates were the original isolate and strains constructed by transduction of the neomycin-resistance marker into wild type s. meliloti  <dig> via phage ϕm <dig>  <cit> . 

plant nodulation assays
the host plant medicago sativa  cv. iroquois was prepared for inoculation with s. meliloti as in leigh et al.  with modifications: seeds were sterilized for  <dig> minutes in 50% bleach, rinsed in sterile water, and germinated for 3 days on 1% w/v plant cell culture-tested agar/water   <cit> . seedlings were then moved to individual 100 mm x 15 mm jensen’s medium plates  <cit> , and inoculated with  <dig> μl of od600 =  <dig>  s. meliloti of the appropriate strain. plants were grown in a percival ar-36 l incubator  at 21°c, with 60–70% relative humidity, and 100–175 μmol m−2 s− <dig> light. plants were measured at 5 weeks and  <dig>  weeks of growth. t-tests  were performed in microsoft excel and in graphpad .

nodulation competition assays were performed in the same way as the plant assays described above, except that strains to be tested in competition against one another were prepared as a mixed 1: <dig> inoculum immediately before inoculation. bacteria were harvested from nodules after  <dig> or  <dig>  weeks of growth by excising the nodules from roots, surface sterilizing in 20% bleach for 5 min., washing in sterile, distilled water, and crushing the nodules in  <dig>  ml tubes with a micro-pestle , in lb +  <dig>  m glucose  <cit> . dilutions of the material from crushed nodules were plated on lbmc + 500 μg/ml streptomycin. colonies were patched from these plates to lbmc + 500 μg/ml streptomycin and 200 μg/ml neomycin to determine the fraction of bacteria that carry the neomycin-resistance marker in the insertion plasmid pjh <dig> 

detection of β-glucuronidase activity and imaging of root nodules
β-glucuronidase expression by bacteria within nodules was detected by excising nodules, surface sterilizing with 20% bleach for 5 min., rinsing in sterile water, and staining in x-gluc buffer   <cit>  for the amount of time indicated in table  <dig>  whole nodules were imaged on an az <dig> multi-zoom microscope equipped with a ds-fi <dig>   <dig> megapixel color camera . β-glucuronidase expression by bacteria on lbmc plates was detected by streaking bacteria to plates that had been spread with  <dig> μl of x-gluc solution . 

RESULTS
comparisons of sinorhizobium meliloti open reading frames with those of other rhizobia and with non-nitrogen fixing α-proteobacteria
rhizobial functions required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation with legume plants have typically been discovered through the classical bacterial genetic technique of transposon mutagenesis, followed by screening mutants for loss of symbiotic function. we have used an alternative comparative genomics strategy to search for rhizobial genes involved in symbiosis. in this approach, searches of the joint genome institute, integrated microbial genomes  system  <cit>  were performed to find orfs that s. meliloti  <dig> shares with the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing α-proteobacteria  s. medicae wsm <dig>  rhizobium etli cfn  <dig>  rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, mesorhizobium loti maff <dig>  and bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig>  a novel aspect of this strategy is that these searches were restricted by prior elimination of all s. meliloti orfs that are present in any of  <dig> non-nitrogen-fixing, non-symbiotic α-proteobacteria .  the genomes used in the analysis were chosen based on the rhizobial genomes available in the jgi img database when the analysis was initially performed. the searches were conducted at multiple identity levels , and the output data from all the searches is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the genome subtractions eliminated genes common to α-proteobacteria with non-symbiotic lifestyles. for example, a search conducted at 50% identity, intersecting the s. meliloti orfs with homologs in the  <dig> α-rhizobia species yields  <dig> genes. however, when the search for homologs is conducted with subtraction of the orfs from the  <dig> non-rhizobial species, the search yield is  <dig> genes .

the result of the searches was a list of  <dig> orfs common to the α-rhizobia , but not found in the non-nitrogen-fixing, non-symbiotic α-proteobacteria. among these  <dig> orfs were  <dig> genes known to be involved in nitrogen fixation , including: nifhnifdnifknifbnifenifnfixafixb, and fixc  and  <dig> known to be involved in nod factor production, including nodanodbnodcnodj and nodi <cit> , thus  <dig> %  of the orfs selected by this comparative gemonics approach are already known to be important for symbiotic function. 

there were also  <dig> hypothetical proteins/proteins of unknown function among the  <dig> orfs detected in the comparative genomic screen. the predicted functions of the remaining orfs included transposases, transcriptional regulators, transport proteins, and adenylate/guanylate cyclases . these are classes of genes that may participate in many of the functions that distinguish α-rhizobia from their non-symbiotic α-proteobacterial relatives, such as signaling to the host plant, reprogramming their metabolism for nitrogen fixation, and importing specific nutrients and differentiation signals from the plant  <cit> . also, atypical adenylate cyclases have been noted before in the rhizobia  <cit> .

construction and symbiosis assays of mutants in conserved genes
thirteen of the  <dig> conserved orfs were chosen for further study because they are of undetermined function in s. meliloti and have no close homologs in the s. meliloti genome that might be expected to provide redundant function. six of the longer orfs, including smc <dig>  were disrupted by cloning a small internal orf fragment into the plasmid pjh <dig>  conjugating the plasmid into s. meliloti  <dig>  and selecting for single-crossover insertion/disruption mutants.  for the  <dig> remaining orfs,  <dig> that are under 750 bp long  and  <dig> that are all in a single operon , deletion was judged to be a better strategy than disruption. smc <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> were all deleted as a single segment from the start codon of smc <dig> to the stop codon of smc <dig>  the endpoints of the individual deletions of smc <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> were dictated by the position of the most suitable pcr primers.  either the disruption or the deletion strategy is expected to result in a strain that does not produce a full-length version of the protein encoded by that orf. these orfs and the insertion and/or deletion mutant strains of each are listed and described in table  <dig>  the resulting mutant strains were then tested for symbiotic proficiency on the host plant alfalfa.

for the initial phenotypic analysis, the ability of the mutants to successfully provide the plants with fixed nitrogen was determined. alfalfa plants were inoculated with the bacterial mutants and after 5 weeks of growth, the shoot length attained on nitrogen-free medium was compared with plants inoculated with the s. meliloti  <dig> wild type as the positive control and uninoculated plants as the negative control. figure  <dig> shows the shoot length of alfalfa plants inoculated with wild type s. meliloti  <dig> or with disruption mutant strains of the orfs smb <dig>  smb <dig>  smc <dig>  sma <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig>  alfalfa plants inoculated with these strains attain a similar average shoot length as that of the wild type, demonstrating that all of these strains are able to form a successful symbiosis with this host plant. figure  <dig> presents the same type of assay as figure  <dig> for deletion mutants in the orfs smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc01424- <dig>  smc <dig>  and sma <dig>  additional data on the plant assays in figures  <dig> and  <dig> is presented in table  <dig>  the number of plants inoculated with each strain, the average number of mature, pink nodules per plant and the average number of white pseudonodules per plant are shown. all of these mutant strains are able to mount a successful symbiosis with the host plant alfalfa.

smc <dig> is the most strongly expressed in the nodule of the conserved orfs
to determine if the  <dig> orfs analyzed in this study might play a role in symbiosis, despite the fact that they are not strictly required for symbiosis, the expression pattern of each of these orfs was determined both for bacteria within the nodule and in the free-living state. the smc <dig> orf is very strongly expressed by bacteria within the nodule , but it expressed at a very low level by free-living bacteria on lbmc plates . the nodules shown in figure  <dig> are expressing β-glucuronidase  from a pjh <dig> plasmid insertion in smc <dig>  the nodules shown were stained for  <dig>  hr. there is strong staining throughout the nodule, with slightly weaker staining at the invasion zone near the distal end of the nodule. the nodule expression of the smc00911::gus fusion is much stronger than the expression of any of the other fusions tested . in contrast, smc <dig> is expressed at a very low level by free-living s. meliloti carrying the smc00911::gus fusion grown on lbmc plates . for comparison, figure 3g also shows that a grea::gus fusion strain of s. meliloti constructed with the same reporter insertion plasmid, pjh <dig>  is strongly expressed under these conditions. table  <dig> summarizes the expression data for all of the gus fusion strains.

two of the other orfs tested, smb <dig> and smc <dig>  are also strongly expressed in nodules , and another six, smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc <dig> and the three orfs in the smc01424- <dig> operon are moderately expressed . of these, only smc <dig> is expressed at approximately the same level by bacteria within the nodule and by free-living bacteria . however, none of the other orfs that are expressed in the nodule are expressed as strongly as smc <dig> . two of the orfs, sma <dig> and smb <dig>  are expressed at a very low level in the nodule, and no nodule expression was detected for smc <dig> and sma <dig> . sma <dig> has an unusual expression pattern in that it is expressed strongly by free-living bacteria , but its expression appears to be much reduced in the nodule .

because of the strong expression of smc <dig> by bacteria in the nodule, the smc <dig> mutant strains were chosen for further study in competition experiments .

an insertion mutant of smc <dig> out-competes the s. meliloti  <dig> wild type for nodule occupancy
many s. meliloti mutant strains that are able to form a successful symbiosis when singly inoculated on host plants are deficient in the ability to successfully compete for nodule occupancy against the wild type strain in a mixed infection  <cit> . competitive nodulation experiments are likely to be a better approximation of the situation that rhizobial bacteria encounter in the soil, where they may be competing against several different rhizobial strains for host plant invasion and nodule occupancy. the smc <dig> insertion mutant strains were chosen for competition analysis because this orf is strongly expressed in the nodule and these strains might be expected to be at a competitive disadvantage in the absence of the full-length smc <dig> protein. however, in contrast to expectations, the smc <dig> insertion mutant strains strongly out-compete the s. meliloti  <dig> wild type strain for nodule occupancy in a mixed 1: <dig> infection . of the nodules tested from plants inoculated with a 1: <dig> mixture of  <dig> wild type and an smc <dig> insertion mutant, all of the nodules were colonized by either the smc <dig> insertion mutant alone or by a mixture of the mutant and the wild type . less than 22% of the mixed-inoculum nodules were colonized by  <dig> wild type alone. also, all of the mixed nodules contained a larger proportion of smc <dig> insertion mutant bacteria than  <dig> wild type bacteria . the recovered bacteria from one of the  <dig> nodules that had been inoculated with the smc <dig> xsd <dig> strain alone included a small number of neomycin-sensitive colonies . this suggests that the gene disruption plasmid inserted in the smc <dig> orf is lost by bacteria in the nodule at a very low rate. taken together, these competition results suggest that disruption of the smc <dig> orf actually confers a competitive advantage to s. meliloti in the symbiosis with host plants. the smc <dig> orf is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with a rhodanese-like sulfurtransferase domain from amino acids 7– <dig> and a chromate-resistance protein domain from amino acids 122– <dig>  <cit> . the smc <dig> mutants carry the pjh104-gus-expression/disruption plasmid inserted at nucleotide position  <dig> out of  <dig> total nucleotides, which would result in the production of a truncated protein containing only amino acids 1– <dig>  based on the s. meliloti  <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . thus the smc <dig> insertion mutants are predicted to produce a protein that contains the whole rhodanese-like sulfurtransferase domain, but only a portion of the chromate-resistance protein domain. 

* 1– <dig> nodules/plant were analyzed.

in contrast to the smc <dig> insertion mutants, deletion mutants of smc <dig> ) are able to compete as effectively as s. meliloti  <dig> wild type against a competitor assay strain carrying a neomycin-resistance marker , suggesting that the loss of this protein confers neither a symbiotic disadvantage nor an advantage to s. meliloti  <dig> 

discussion
smc <dig>  a conserved rhizobial orf expressed strongly in the nodule
our comparative genomics screen has identified an s. meliloti  <dig> orf  that is strongly expressed within host plant nodules, but is expressed in the free-living state at a very low level. surprisingly, disruption of this orf confers a competitive advantage for nodule occupancy on s. meliloti  <dig>  smc <dig> is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with overall similarity to sodm-like  proteins  <cit> . there are  <dig> “sodm-like proteins” with >40% identity to smc <dig> in the ncbi database  <cit> . smc <dig> contains two distinct, conserved domains: a  <dig> amino acid domain  similar to the glpe sufurtransferase/rhodanese homology domain , and a  <dig> amino acid  chromate-resistance-exported protein domain   <cit> . the smc <dig> mutant strains constructed in this study are predicted to produce a protein consisting of the first  <dig> amino acids of the full-length protein plus four amino acids encoded by the multiple cloning site of pjh <dig>  before encountering a stop codon   <cit> . this truncated protein product would include the entire rhodanese-homology domain and approximately half of the chromate-resistance protein domain. one possibility is that the competitive advantage that the smc00911-insertion mutant strains have against the  <dig> wild type strain is due to the expression of this truncated protein, rather than simply a loss-of-function of the full-length protein. even though smc <dig> is annotated as a “sodm-like” protein in the ncbi database  <cit> , there are only two short segments of similarity  with a protein confirmed to be a sodm from xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris   <cit> . thus, since the n-terminal similarity of smc <dig> to the glpe sufurtransferase/rhodanese homology domain and the c-terminal similarity to the chromate-resistance protein domain are both greater than the similarity of this protein to sodm, “sodm-like” may not be the most-appropriate annotation for this orf. there are two sod orfs in the s. meliloti  <dig> genome, sodb   and a bacteriocuprein-family sodc   <cit> . an s. meliloti  <dig> sodb loss-of-function mutant forms a functional symbiosis with host plants  <cit> , while the symbiotic phenotype of a sodc mutant has not been reported.

expression of other αhizobial conserved orfs
although they are not required for development of a functional symbiosis by s. meliloti  <dig>  the orfs smb <dig> and smc <dig> are also strongly expressed in nodules, while smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc <dig> and the smc01424- <dig> operon are moderately expressed . however, the expression of smc <dig> is not specific to the nodule . smb <dig> is predicted to encode a protein of the clp-protease superfamily , with specific similarity to clpp  <cit> . polar localization of the clpxp protease complex within s. meliloti cells has been found to be important for s. meliloti bacteroid differentiation  <cit> , and it is possible that clpp proteases play a role in the bacteroid differentiation process. interestingly, in another study, a signature-tagged mutant in smb <dig> was found to be highly competitive for survival, in the free-living state, in competition experiments under salt- and detergent-stressed conditions  <cit> . smc <dig> is predicted to encode a member of the gyd-domain containing protein superfamily   <cit> . no function has been reported for this protein family  <cit> . smc <dig> is predicted to encode a member of the von willebrand factor type a  superfamily , however proteins containing a vfwa domain participate in a wide variety of functions  <cit> . expression of smc <dig> has previously been shown to increase in bacteroids  <cit>  , and during phosphate stress  <cit> . smc <dig> is predicted to possess a twin-arginine export signal  <cit> , and to encode a member of the metallophosphatase superfamily , a group of phosphatases with diverse functions  <cit> . orfs smc <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> appear to be part of a single operon and they encode, respectively, a predicted nitrile hydratase alpha subunit protein, a nitrile hydratase beta subunit protein, and a nitrile hydratase activator protein  <cit> . nitrile hydratases function in the degradation of xenobiotic compounds, but they are also involved in tryptophan metabolism, specifically in the conversion of 3-indoleacetonitrile to indole-3-acetamide, which is a precursor of the plant hormone auxin  <cit> . sma <dig> has an unusual expression pattern in that it is expressed at a very low level in approximately half of the nodules tested , but is expressed quite strongly by free-living s. meliloti on lbmc medium . sma <dig> is predicted to encode a member of the duf <dig> superfamily, which is has no known function  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to identify s. meliloti  <dig> orfs involved in host plant nodulation and nitrogen fixation. the comparative genomics method we employed was able to rediscover  <dig> orfs that have previously been shown to be important for nodulation and/or nitrogen fixation. the earlier studies that identified these genes, in most cases, employed the classical bacterial genetic techniques of transposon mutagenesis, followed by strain isolation and phenotypic screening  <cit>  <cit> . our study identified  <dig> additional s. meliloti orfs  that we have shown are expressed primarily in host plant nodules. however none of these newly identified orfs were required for development of a functional symbiosis under the conditions we tested. our results suggest that the accumulated transposon screens for essential s. meliloti nodulation/nitrogen fixation genes may be nearing saturation. however, the comparative genomics method described above might be very effective for identifying factors involved in the production of a phenotype common to a group of bacterial species that have not yet been studied by classical transposon mutagenesis screens.
