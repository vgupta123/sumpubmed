BACKGROUND
terrestrial life in extant vertebrates was accompanied by the formation of diverse and rigid body coverings , along with other cornified appendages , that evolved in response to strong selective pressures. these body coverings helped protect vertebrates and allowed them to successfully adapt to environmental pressures like heat, ultra violet radiation, water loss, and mechanical forces  <cit> . since keratinization helps protect the body by forming a barrier between the body and outside world, genes involved in keratinization evolve rapidly in response to changing environment   <cit> . changes in gene family  are involved in adaptive evolution and changes in gene family size could affect expression levels  <cit> . in terrestrial vertebrates, the formation of hard cornified skin appendages involves interactions between fibrous  and matrix proteins  . the fibrous alpha-keratins, type i and ii, appear to have evolved in stem vertebrates  <cit>  and recent studies suggest the presence of hair-specific alpha keratins orthologs in amphibians, reptiles, and birds . however, there is no evidence of krtaps proteins in fishes and amphibians, suggesting that these proteins originated only after the divergence of sauropsids  and mammals , leading to the formation and diversification of hard keratin appendages, feather, claw, scale in sauropsids, and hairs in mammals  <cit> . the structural and functional conservation of keratin intermediate filaments  within mammals contrasts with the large diversity of mammalian hair phenotypes  and highlights the importance of understanding the molecular diversification of the keratin associated protein  multigene family.

hair is a dynamic mini-organ formed by ectodermal-mesodermal interactions  and is broadly divided into the root sheath , hair shaft, and matrix zone. hair has microscopic differences , which have long been used as forensic markers for identifying human ethnicity and classifying mammalian species . hair-fiber formation is a cyclical process, which involves growth , regression , and resting phases , followed by the shedding of the hair shaft. the process involves the expression of both hair keratin intermediate filament proteins and their keratin associated proteins . this cycle is of particular importance in diverse processes such as determining hair size, shedding fur for body surface cleansing, and changing the body cover to adapt to changing environments, such as from hot summers to cold winters  <cit> .

the current diversity of hair in extant mammals is due to innovations and changes in numerous genes and their corresponding proteins. humans have  <dig> functional alpha-keratin genes comprising  <dig> type i and  <dig> type ii keratins  <cit>  arranged in two clusters on chromosomes 17q <dig>  and 12q <dig>   <cit> , which include  <dig> type i and  <dig> type ii hair keratins  <cit> . hair keratin types i and ii undergo higher-ordered copolymerization-forming keratin intermediate filaments  , which are embedded into a matrix formed by keratin associated proteins  involved in the formation of hard cornified resilient hair shafts . the krtap multigene family is divided into two broad groups, high cysteine and high glycine-tyrosine, which together comprise  <dig> subfamilies based on amino acid composition and phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . in humans, krtaps include approximately  <dig> gene members that are arranged in tandem and are clustered on chromosomes 11p <dig> , 11q <dig> , 17q <dig> , 21q <dig> , and 21q <dig>  . given the role of the krtap multigene family in formation of hair morphology, we have characterized them in the genomes of  <dig> diverse mammalian species to provide insights on krtap evolution and diversification. we found contrasting krtap gene family repertoires among mammals, as well as differences in rates of gene expansion, contraction and pseudogenization. the two major groups of krtaps showed distinct evolutionary patterns with high concerted evolution influencing species-specific copy number variation and gene homogenization in high cysteine krtaps. in contrast, high glycine-tyrosine genes had more dynamic evolutionary patterns with less gene conversion and recombination, lower gc content, and evidence of positive selection , which may also have been an important force of the evolution in subfamilies of high glycine-tyrosine.

genome scans
advances in genome sequencing have made it easier to explore multigene families across different genomes. expansion, contraction and pseudogenization, along with genomic/chromosomal organization  of gene families, are important mechanisms driving genome evolution and influencing fitness within lineages or species  <cit> , as suggested by lineage- or species-specific variations in genes involved in pathogen recognition, stress response and structural proteins . here, we explored the krtap multigene family in the genome assemblies of  <dig> mammalian species:  alpaca  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, vicpac <dig>  jul  <dig>   armadillo  low-coverage 2×, assembly, dasnov <dig>  jul  <dig>   bushbaby  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, otogar <dig>  may  <dig>   cow  coverage 7×, assembly btau_ <dig> , oct  <dig>   dolphin  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, turtru <dig>  jul  <dig>   elephant  coverage 7×, assembly, loxafr <dig> , jul  <dig>   gibbon  whole genome coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, nleu <dig> , jan  <dig>   gorilla  gorgor <dig>  dec  <dig>   guinea pig  high-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, cavpor <dig>  mar  <dig>   hedgehog  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, erieur <dig>  jun  <dig>   horse  coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, equ cab  <dig>  sep  <dig>   marmoset , ncbi build  <dig> ,  megabat  low-coverage  <dig> × assembly, ptevam <dig>  jul  <dig>   mouse lemur  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, micmur <dig>  jun  <dig>   orangutan  ncbi build  <dig> ,  panda  high-coverage, assembly, ailmel <dig>  jul  <dig>   pig  from ncbi build  <dig> , high-coverage, assembly, sscrofa <dig>  jun  <dig>   <dig>   rabbit  high-coverage, assembly, orycun <dig>  nov  <dig>   sloth  low-coverage  <dig> ×, assembly, chohof <dig>  sep  <dig>   tarsier  low-coverage,  <dig> × assembly, tarsyr <dig>  jul  <dig>   tree shrew  low-coverage 2×, assembly, tupbel <dig>  jun  <dig>  and  wallaby  coverage 2×, assembly, meug_ <dig> , dec  <dig>  available at ensembl and ncbi websites http://www.ensembl.org/

characterization of krtap gene family
the krtap multigene family consists of ~100- <dig> gene members divided into two major classes, high cystine  and high glycine/tyrosine , which in turn are divided into many subfamilies with unique motifs and sequence repeats. we assigned all krtap multigene family members to their respective subfamilies following previously published guidelines  <cit> . we built species-specific phylogenetic trees to classify the gene subfamilies for each genome , as well as a phylogenetic tree incorporating all members belonging to the high glycine-tyrosine krtap multigene family from  <dig> genomes . we also observed that one-to-one orthologous relationships diminished as species diverged over time . we used the amino acid composition, unique motifs and sequence repeats, as well as blast results, to classify intact genes, partial genes and pseudogenes. the most-closely-related subfamilies are generally located in close proximity and in tandem arrangements in the genome, as are the members of the same subfamily. due to the incomplete nature of the genomes analyzed, not all the genes may have been retrieved. therefore, in the dolphin and other species of low genome coverage, we have assumed that missing genes may be due to low coverage that will be characterized by future research. however, we found a large number of pseudogenes in the dolphin genome compared with other low coverage genomes.figure  <dig>

to prove the absence of krtap genes in high coverage genomes with intact gene clusters, we performed synteny analysis and searched for human orthologs that should be flanking the missing krtap genes. for example, in pig the 5’ and 3’ human orthologs flanking the krtap cluster  <dig> was missing, indicating that this region has most-likely not been sequenced and that further research and/or higher genomic coverage is needed for confirmation. we verified the synteny of conserved orthologs flanking the missing genes for the subfamily krtap <dig> in the callitrix, cow and elephant, along with krtap <dig>  krtap <dig> and krtap <dig> in cavia, and krtap <dig> in rabbit.

species-specific subfamily differences, changes in the total number of genes, functional genes, pseudogenes, amino acid content  and size polymorphism in genes within subfamilies may be responsible for the species-specific hair characteristics and the marked variability found in hair patterns among mammalian species.

genomic organization of the krtap gene family
the krtap gene family consists of  <dig> subfamilies,  <dig> of which are high cysteine and six are high glycine-tyrosine. the complete krtap gene family is arranged into five clusters at five different genomic locations . each cluster contains members of one or more subfamilies arranged in a tandem array. the genomic organization of the krtap gene family is similar in all species studied, with only slight variations. subfamilies krtap  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are present in cluster one. all high glycine-tyrosine  krtap subfamilies, together with krtap  <dig>   <dig>  24- <dig> subfamilies, form cluster two. subfamilies krtap <dig> and krtap <dig> form cluster three, whereas cluster four consists of subfamily krtap <dig> and cluster five of subfamily krtap <dig> figure  <dig>

cluster  <dig> shows some variation. for example in primates, krtap cluster  <dig> is divided into two paralogous gene clusters, most likely through segmental duplication, with both clusters having members of the krtap <dig> subfamily . in all of the other mammals studied, genes of the krtap <dig> subfamily form a single cluster. the krtap subfamilies that are clustered together in the genome  are phylogenetically closely related    <cit>  confirms the strong evolutionary constrain acting on their genomic arrangement  <cit> . the conserved clustering of krtaps seems to be related with its ordered expression in follicle  <cit> .

krtap gene family dynamics and hair characteristics
previously, the krtap gene repertoire had been assessed in eight mammalian species  <cit> , all terrestrial species with few characteristic differences in hair phenotypes. here we expanded on previous results by analyzing  <dig> additional mammalian species consisting of a much more diverse group of mammals including species from different mammalian orders with diverse hair characteristics, such as the armadillo , hedgehog , alpaca , sloth  and dolphin , along with several more-closely related species, e.g. members of hominidae family in primates.

we identified near complete krtap gene repertoires in  <dig> mammalian genomes, including  <dig> high-coverage genomes . our findings suggest that the most recent common ancestor of mammals is supposed to have had 53%  of the known krtap subfamilies  . extant monotremes  and marsupials , have slightly different subfamilies representation , while eutherians have up to 93%  of the krtap subfamilies. this shows that the diversification of the krtap gene family occurred early in mammalian evolution, likely starting after the split of sauropsids  and synapsids  around  <dig> myr ago  <cit> . sauropsids developed krtaps  in hard appendages like feathers, beaks, scales and claw, etc., and synapsids developed mkrtaps present in hair, nails, hoofs, claws, etc. the presence of glycine rich proteins such as hgt in mammals and hgp  in reptiles and birds is evidence of their radiation from a common ancestor  <cit>  and suggest that these changes may have contributed to the successful radiation of mammals, reptiles and birds. further expansion and diversification of the krtap gene family, favored by high rates of concerted evolution in hs-krtaps and positive selection in hgt-krtaps, led to the species-specific hair characteristics observed in extant mammals. additional analyses of sauropsid and the mammalian krtaps are likely to reveal insights into the patterns of adaptive radiation present in extant reptilian, birds and mammalian krtaps. subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> first appear in therian mammals after their divergence from monothremes around  <dig> myr ago  <cit> . subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are specific to placental mammals , and thus appeared after their divergence from marsupials around  <dig> myr ago  <cit> . subfamily  <dig> is absent in afrotheria and xenarthra, which suggests an origin within placental mammals only after the divergence from the atlantogenata clade . monotremes and marsupials lack subfamily  <dig>  which we observed to have expanded dramatically in the basal placental mammal xenartha  to  <dig> members. we noted that the krtap gene family shows species-specific variation as expected due to concerted evolution, and some of the subfamilies are restricted to particular species, e.g. subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are present only in mouse and rat, subfamily  <dig> in mouse, and subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> in platypus  <cit>  . we also observed remarkable differences among these krtap genes , including a dramatic gene expansion with  <dig> members  in sloth , a nocturnal hairy mammal with long, coarse and shaggy fur that serves as a host for different microorganism  <cit>  . similarly, we found gene expansion in subfamily  <dig>  in the rodent guinea pig , and  <dig> genes copies in the marsupial wallaby . subfamily  <dig> has expanded in rabbit  , which belongs to order lagomorpha. we typically observed functional genes in  subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  24- <dig> and  <dig> varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of three. the subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have a maximum of one functional gene member, subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> have a maximum of two functional genes , and subfamily  <dig> has a maximum of three members . subfamily  <dig>  belonging to the high glycine-tyrosine group, has a maximum of one functional gene member . we found that closely related species, e.g. among hominidae family , have very similar gene repertoires with only slight differences . we also observed the apparent reduction in the krtap gene repertoire in alpaca , armadillo , hedgehog , and dolphin  , probably due to the replacement or modification of hair function or to extensive specialization and subsequent selection and pseudogenization.table  <dig>

variation in krtap gene family in mammals and relation with hair characteristic features.




for example, we observed high rates of pseudogenization   and only nine intact genes in the dolphin . this aquatic mammal is almost hairless, with only a few hairs  on the upper lip of the rostrum, which are shed soon after birth, leaving hairless pits on the rostrum of adults that have specialized sensory function  . the epidermal surface also undergoes high proliferation and sloughing of epidermis cells in order to maintain a smooth skin, a major advantage for swimming  <cit> .

concerted evolution, gc bias and sequence divergence
tandemly arranged gene members of multigene families often show more similarity among each other than with their counterpart’s orthologs in other species, which suggest that they evolved in similar or concerted fashion. this would further lead to species-specific variation, as observed in krtap gene family. two mechanisms play an important role in concerted evolution. recombination increases the copy number of gene by providing raw material for further functional innovations and diversification, and gene conversion, which principally homogenizes genes, can help insure the rapid synthesis of a gene product  that may be required during a precise stage of cell cycle  <cit> . gene conversion also decreases the evolutionary distance among paralogous members and shifts the substitutions from weak  to strong  by increasing gc content through biased gene conversion  . the negative correlation between evolutionary distance calculated by synonymous substitution rates and gc content provides the level of divergence between the members of a subfamily  <cit> .

using geneconv  <cit>  and rdp <dig>  <cit>  we found higher rates of gene conversion and recombination events in the high cysteine krtaps compared with the high glycine-tyrosine krtap genes . krtap subfamilies also displayed different rates of gene conversion in different species. for example, in gorilla we found  <dig> gene pairs of the krtap <dig> under gene conversion, compared to only  <dig> gene pairs found for this subfamily in gibbon . the high level of gene conversion also reduces orthologous relationship between genes of two different species.

sequences with higher synonymous substitution rates  had higher overall gc content  and third-codon gc content , and lower synonymous substitution rates in the high-cysteine genes than the high glycine-tyrosine genes. the negative correlation between gc content and synonymous substitution rate  is consistent with the higher rates of concerted evolution observed in high cysteines . the high gc content in the hs –krtap gene family compared with the hgt-krtap could be a consequence of the high number of gene conversion events.figure  <dig>

adaptive evolution
gene expansion provides the essential raw material for the positive selection to act  <cit> , which in turn accelerates the diversification of duplicated copies by increasing the number of nonsynonymous substitutions  relative to the synonymous substitutions  through positive selection . the paml package  <cit>  was used to identify signatures of positive selection. specifically, we used likelihood ratio test for positive selection  <cit>  to test site-specific models comparing twice the difference in log-likelihood between two models to chi square distribution with two degrees of freedom. for expanded subfamilies, such as in the case of the krtap <dig> in wallaby with  <dig> members, we tested if this species-specific expansion has been influenced by adaptive evolution. we tested two nested pairs of site-specific models , where m1a and m <dig> states no positive selection  and m2a and m <dig> states positive selection . in both cases the likelihood of positive selection was significantly higher , retrieving similar sites under positive selection. the likelihood ratio test is a conservative approach, which can be biased by false positives in the presence of high recombination rates  <cit> . thus, we evaluated the possibility of gene conversion/recombination in the krtap <dig> subfamily that has expanded dramatically in the wallaby genome, but did not detect such evidence. the results of positive selection tests are shown in table  <dig>  the positive selection acting of krtap probably favored the diversification and adaptation to different environment.table  <dig>

differential evolution of the hs and hgt krtaps
the krtap multigene family has experienced dynamic evolution and diversification within and among genomes as observed in the  <dig> diverse subfamilies of high cysteine and high glycine-tyrosine subfamilies. these two groups have evolved differently, with the high cysteine group showing high rates of gene conversion within subfamilies, with some exhibiting characteristic differences in copy number, while others have been more conserved. this may be an adaptive mechanism promoting a high order of amplification of similar copies to meet the high demand for the structural proteins required to adapt to changing environmental conditions . we also compared the differential evolutionary patterns between high cysteine and high glycine–tyrosine genes using the pearson correlation coefficient for the number of genes in each subfamily between species. the coefficient value for high cysteine is significantly higher than for high glycine-tyrosine  and the coefficient values for the two are positively correlated  . the high gc content and negative correlation between gc content and synonymous substitution rates also support the higher rates of gene conversion observed in high cysteine genes relative to high glycine-tyrosine krtaps, suggesting that high cysteine are under high rates of concerted evolution promoted by gene conversion and recombination events . by contrast, hgt-krtap had a more-dynamic evolutionary pattern, with less evidence of gene conversion or recombination, but with signatures of positive selection.figure  <dig> 
pearson correlation coefficients  show the evolutionary differentiation of krtap genes. pearson correlation coefficients  values of the high cysteine and high glycine-tyrosine krtap are positively correlated. the linear regression is shown.  the boxplot for pearson correlation coefficients  of gene numbers of each subfamily between species shows, high cysteine krtap genes have higher correlation coefficient than high glycine-tyrosine krtap genes .



size polymorphism and amino acid composition affects krtap matrix formation and interactions with hair kifs
the krtap family is widely grouped into three major categories based on amino acid composition:  high sulfur , including subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  10- <dig>   <dig>  24- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 35;  ultrahigh sulfur , including subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies; and  high glycine/tyrosine, including subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the amino acid composition is shown in table  <dig>  subfamily gene members also showed size polymorphism  mostly due to cysteine-rich repeats, which create difference in cysteine content. cysteine is important for the formation of strong disulphide bonds. thus, changes in cysteine composition can result in differential interaction among krtaps and between kifs and kratps leading to combinatorial complexity and thereby creating morphological differences in hair fiber strength, rigidity and flexibility  <cit> .table  <dig>

discussion
gene families are formed by gene duplication, a process that provides important raw material for functional innovation and adaptive selection. gene families vary in size from a few to thousands of gene members, which makes it difficult to identify and characterize them without sufficient genome sequences. the genome sequencing projects have made it possible to explore complex gene families involved in different phenotypes. here we explored the mammal-specific krtap gene family, which is the major constituent of the hair proteome and plays a primary role in hair formation and thus long been associated with phenotypic differences in hair and wool. this study assessed patterns of variation using comparative genomic approaches in the krtap gene family. our study used  <dig> diverse mammalian genomes that encompassed closely related species, e.g. family hominidae of primates, comparing apes with dense hair cover with human with much less hair cover, along with species with diverse hair related characteristic, e.g. alpaca , armadillo , hedgehog , sloth  and dolphin , to obtain greater insights into the krtap gene family evolution relative to mammalian hair and phenotypic variations.

we found high molecular diversity within the krtap gene family, with  <dig> subfamilies   and approximately 100- <dig> krtap gene members, which are arranged in five clusters at five different chromosome locations in a genome . most krtap subfamilies are found in all mammalian orders, with variations in expansion, contraction, presence/absence, different rates of pseudogenization and sequence variation . for example, we found species-specific differences in the size and compositions of some subfamilies  probably caused by unequal crossing over accompanied with high gc content. moreover, we also found lineage-specific trends, such as in marsupials, where both wallaby and opossum lacked subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and showed expansion of the krtap <dig> subfamily, which is under positive selection . however, highly conserved sequences and the maintenance of the same number of members in subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggests that high rates of gene conversion maintain homogeneity and with evolution occurring through a process of punctuated equilibrium  <cit> . similarly, the conserved synteny of krtap gene clusters shows that there are also strong constraints acting on this gene family and supports the important role of krtap gene family in shaping hair characteristics.

together with the high molecular diversity of the ktrap gene family observed in our study, considerable intraspecific diversification has been reported earlier with copy number variations  in ethnic human populations and allelic variations in sheep. such sequence polymorphism found in krtap gene members may influence its expression, protein structure, and/or post-translation modifications and consequently effect wool/hair fibre structure and wool/hair quality traits  <cit> . for example, evidence of linkage reported between krtap6- <dig> and wool fiber diameter  in sheep  <cit>  may be related with similar characteristics in alpaca , which has one of the largest number of krtap <dig> genes  in mammals. further exploration of kratp gene family in sheep could help shed light on the improvement of hair/wool traits  <cit> .

interestingly, we found differences in krtap gene repertoire related with hair features. a very expanded krtap gene family repertoire  was found in sloth, which has long, dense and coarse body hair cover, which also serves as a host for symbiotic microorganisms  in this arboreal mammal. by contrast, we have detected a reduced number of functional krtap genes and high percentage of krtap pseudogenes  in dolphin , highlighting the much lower krtap gene requirement in this smooth-skinned species that only has a few hairs  at the rostrum. these are lost soon after birth and in adults the hairless pits are adapted for sensory functions . this example illustrates the adaptive potential of hair follicles to diversify into more specialized sensory organs.

we also observed that several unique hair-related phenotypes in some of the species, such as scales in armadillo, fiber in alpaca and spines in hedgehog, are linked with an inverse correlation between the number of intact krtap genes and the number of pseudogenes. armadillo and hedgehog have specialized hair features, where the pattern in alpaca could be due to inbreeding and genome homogenization during domestication. the “hairless” dolphin had a large number of krtap pseudogenes relative to intact genes . in contrast, the sloth showed a high positive correlation with intact krtap genes, suggesting that changes in krtap can be related to morphological diversity of hair phenotypes . in contrast, we did not find any correlation between the comparatively hairless human and other primates, which favors the hypothesis, that diversification of keratinization structures in mammals may be collectively explained by krtap gene number variation together with other biological mechanisms, such as gene expression variation in krtaps .

we suggest that the diverse repertoire and variability in krtaps  provides extraordinary combinatorial complexity  <cit>  for interaction between krtaps and keratin intermediate filaments, resulting in a rich diversity of pathways for evolutionary change, which together with differences in higher order expression of krtap genes results in the diverse hair morphological characteristic visible in extant mammals. overall, we conclude that krtaps play an important role in evolution and diversification of hair character across mammals and are responsible for unique features of hair.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study explored krtap gene family evolution in various mammalian species inhabiting diverse terrestrial and aquatic environments. the two groups of the krtap gene family, high cysteine and high glycine-tyrosine krtap genes, have evolve differently, resulting in species-specific diversification of this multi-gene family and leading wide morphological diversity in hair characteristics in extant mammals. we conclude that differences in krtap gene family repertoires, together with changes in expression patterns, are responsible for shaping unique hair characteristics in diverse mammalian species. these differences are more pronounced between aquatic and terrestrial species and demonstrate the important adaptive role of hairs in terrestrial colonization and the radiation of mammals from water to land. future studies comparing the krtap repertoire in key model organisms, e.g. alpaca and sheep, may provide insights to understanding the role of krtap gene variations in hair fibre traits and its use in textile industry.
