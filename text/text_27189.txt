BACKGROUND
rice  is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population, especially in developing countries. drought is the most serious environmental stress, limiting crop growth and productivity: drought-induced loss in crop yield probably exceeds losses from all other causes <cit> . drought tolerance , therefore, is a major aim of rice breeding, especially in tropical asian and african countries <cit> . dt is a complex trait, and a number of quantitative trait loci  for dt in rice have been identified <cit> . however, breeding drought-tolerant rice is hard to achieve by conventional strategies, including marker-assisted selection. understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dt is therefore needed for successful, knowledge-based crop improvement <cit> .

determining the mechanisms directly involved in dt remains a challenging task because it involves several metabolic and morphologically adaptive pathways <cit> . abscisic acid  is an important phytohormone involved in drought stress tolerance in plants, whose mechanism in plant dt is relatively clear. under drought stress, aba-mediated stomatal closure is the mechanism used by plants to adapt to water deficiency. reactive oxygen species , including hydrogen peroxide, which are widely generated under stress, have been proposed to function as second messengers in aba signaling in guard cells. in guard cells, aba-stimulated ros accumulation activates plasma membrane calcium channels and triggers stomatal closure <cit> . it was reported that jasmonic acid  is also associated with stomatal closure under drought stress, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain elusive. though there is no evidence in relevance of gibberellic acid  and stomatal closure under drought stress, reduction of ga levels and signaling has been shown to contribute to plant growth inhibition under several abiotic stresses, including cold, salt and osmotic stress <cit> .

many efforts have been made to identify the genes involved in drought stress tolerance in a number of plant species. several drought-responsive genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, dehydration-responsive element binding protein, and protein phosphatase 2c were characterized as key components in the molecular network of dt <cit> . in rice, genome-wide gene expression analyses identified many drought stress-responsive genes. however, many of these drought stress-responsive genes have unknown functions, and details of their dt molecular mechanisms remain to be determined <cit> .

rice is more sensitive to drought stress than other cereals, and large genotypic variation in dt exists within the cultivated rice gene pool and its wild relatives <cit> . selective introgression of dt donor segments into a drought-sensitive  elite recurrent parent by backcrossing is an effective way to improve drought stress tolerance in rice <cit> . in a previous study, we developed a dt introgression line , h <dig>  using the dt donor psbrc <dig>  and the ds recurrent parent huang-hua-zhan  . compared with completely different genotypes with contrasting performance on the target trait, the ils can largely reduce the genetic background noise in comparative transcriptomic analysis with the recurrent parent because the selected dt ils carry a small number of genomic segments from a known dt donor <cit> . taking advantage of the combination of genome dna re-sequencing and next-generation rna sequencing , ils can effectively identify genes related to dt, thereby increasing our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of this complex trait in rice <cit> . in the present study, dt il and its parental lines were used to analyze their transcriptome changes under drought stress comparatively, with the aim of extending our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of dt in rice.

RESULTS
drought stress physiology of three rice genotypes
at the tillering stage, there was no visible difference observed among h <dig>  p <dig>  and hhz after  <dig> and 2 days of drought stress; however, obvious leaf rolling in hhz was observed after 3 days of drought stress. this phenomenon was not observed in h <dig> and p <dig> until 4 days of drought stress . the yield performance of three genotypes were remarkably reduced by drought stress compared with the well-watered control; however, h <dig> and p <dig> achieved 26% and 21% higher grain yields compared with hhz under drought conditions .

to investigate the physiological difference in dt of three genotypes, several indices of drought-induced effects on leaves at the tillering stage were measured. the water loss rate  from excised leaves was determined for the three genotypes: h <dig> and p <dig> showed relatively lower wlr than hhz over a period of 10 h . accordingly, the relative water contents  in h <dig>  and p <dig>  were significantly higher than that in hhz  after 3 days of drought stress .figure  <dig>

stomatal closure is one of the first responses to drought conditions that might control plant dehydration <cit> . to investigate the stomatal status of the three rice genotypes at the tillering stage under drought stress, leaf surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy . h <dig> and p <dig> had significantly higher stomatal closure rate than hhz after 1 day of drought stress  . relative electrolyte leakage , which is an indicator of cell membrane injury, was also detected. the rels of h <dig> and p <dig> were significantly lower than that of hhz after 3 days of drought stress , indicating that h <dig> and p <dig> experienced significantly less cell membrane injury than hhz under drought stress conditions. additionally, the activities of catalase  and ascorbate peroxidase  in h <dig> and p <dig> were significantly higher than that in hhz under drought stress conditions , showing their active detoxification by reactive oxygen scavenging regulation in the two genotypes in response to drought <cit> . taken together, these results demonstrated that the dt of il h <dig> was significantly improved over that of hhz, reflecting the introgression of favorable alleles from dt donor p <dig> into the hhz background.

global gene expression profiling of three genotypes under well-watered and drought stress by transcriptome sequencing
at the tillering stage, total rna from leaves of hhz, p <dig>  and h <dig> at  <dig> and 3 days of drought stress and its corresponding well-watered control were paired-end sequenced using illumina sequencing technology. a total of  <dig> – <dig>  million reads of 100 bp in length were generated for each sample, and the number of mapped reads were in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  million . the unique matching ratio was in the range of  <dig> – <dig> % , the unique matching reads were used for further analysis. the high-quality reads from individual libraries were mapped to the rice genome; more than  <dig>  mapped genes per library were determined simultaneously.table  <dig>

note: ck indicates well watered control; 1d and 3d indicate the drought treatment time;  <dig> and  <dig> in the first row indicate two replicates of each sample.



the detected expressed genes in all samples were subjected to cluster analysis. as shown in additional file <dig>  the three genotypes under  <dig> and 3 days of drought stress and control conditions were separated from each other: h <dig> and hhz were clustered together in each condition subgroup, which was consistent with their similar genetic background. based on this result, the transcriptomic response to 1d and 3d drought stress could be classified as mild stress response  and severe stress response , respectively, in consistent with the previous reports on abiotic stress gene profiling <cit> .

correlation analysis was used to assess the quality of illumina sequencing results between two replicates of each sample. the results indicated that the coefficient of correlation between the biological samples was high, supporting the reproducibility of the results . to validate the illumina sequencing results, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr  was used to assess the expression levels for  <dig> genes of rice independently. the genes and primer sets used are shown in additional file <dig>  rna samples extracted from three additional replicate sets were used as templates. the high correlation  between rna-seq and qrt-rcr expression values indicated that there was a good agreement between both approaches .

intrinsic transcriptome differences of h <dig> and p <dig> compared with hhz prior to drought stress
phenotypic differences resulting from gene expression variation have been observed in species <cit> . to investigate the intrinsic differences in gene expression between the dt genotypes and the ds genotype, the gene expression levels in h <dig> and p <dig> were compared with that in hhz under control conditions. between p <dig> and hhz,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed, which is consistent with their large genetic difference. however, there were only  <dig> genes detected to be differentially expressed between h <dig> and hhz under normal growth conditions . this is consistent with only a few of chromosome fragments being introgressed from p <dig> to hhz. the genes with higher basal expression level in h <dig> compared with hhz were mainly functionally enriched in oxidoreductase activity, lyase activity, carboxylic acid metabolic process, response to stress, and cofactor binding .

these constitutively differentially expressed genes in p <dig> and h <dig> compared with hhz under control conditions could be classified into two groups based on their expression patterns under drought stress conditions. the first group comprised those that were unresponsive to drought stress, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes from p <dig> and h <dig>  respectively, which are functionally enriched in redox regulation and apoptosis-associated proteins . the second group comprised  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed in p <dig> and h <dig> after at least  <dig> or 3 days of drought stress . among them,  <dig> genes  with higher basal expression in both p <dig> and h <dig> were functionally enriched in oxidoreductase and lyase activity. further analysis indicated that  <dig> of these genes were colocalized in the introgressed regions, implying their positive role in the response to drought stress.

comparative transcriptome profiling of three genotypes under drought stress
to determine the similarities and differences in drought-induced transcriptomes in the three genotypes, the gene expression alterations in the three genotypes under  <dig> and 3 days of drought stress compared with their respective controls were analyzed. in h <dig>  p <dig>  and hhz,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs were identified, respectively, after  <dig> or 3 days of drought stress.

after 1 day of drought stress, there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs detected in h <dig>  p <dig>  and hhz, respectively. venn diagram analysis indicated that  <dig> degs  were commonly regulated in the three genotypes by 1 day of drought stress  which accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total degs in h <dig>  p <dig> and hhz, respectively, indicating that the mild drought stress response of the different genotypes is mostly the same. go analysis showed that the commonly up-regulated genes were functionally enriched in the regulation of the biological process, signaling process, and carbohydrate metabolic process ; while the shared down-regulated genes in the three genotypes were mainly associated with cellular protein metabolic process, phosphate metabolic process, and transport .table  <dig>

after 3 days of drought stress,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were identified as degs in h <dig>  p <dig>  and hhz, respectively , showing relatively fewer degs could be detected at the sr phase compared with the mr phase. among them,  <dig> degs  were commonly regulated in three genotypes at the sr phase which accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total degs in h <dig>  p <dig> and hhz, respectively . go analysis of these degs indicated that carbohydrate metabolic process, regulation of cellular process, transcription, macromolecule modification, cellular protein metabolic process, and transport were highly enriched in the sr degs . taken together, the results showed that broad functional categories of genes were commonly involved in drought stress response.

effect of introgression on the transcriptome of h <dig> in response to drought stress
the backcross introgression strategy is widely used for crop improvement. the introgressions combine the genetic background of the recurrent parent, which could result in novel changes in gene expression. to evaluate the effect of introgression on transcriptome of h <dig> under drought stress, the genome-wide gene expressions in h <dig> and hhz under drought stress were compared. the results indicated that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress . only a small proportion of the degs  colocalized with the introgressed regions , indicating introgression could contribute to new dt expression phenotypes in h <dig> relative to hhz.

go enrichment analysis of these degs highlighted the following functional categories: signaling transduction, transcription regulation, stress response, hormones  signal transduction, and ros homeostasis .

genes related to signaling transduction:  <dig> genes encoding receptor kinases  were differentially expressed in h <dig> vs. hhz under drought conditions. among them, two genes encoding cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinases   were up-regulated in h <dig> vs. hhz and one was repressed . eight genes encoding leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases were up-regulated and five were down-regulated in h <dig> relative to hhz. additionally,  <dig> genes encoding kinase proteins were differentially expressed in h <dig> vs. hhz under drought stress. these included four genes encoding calmodulin-dependent protein kinases  . three genes encoding ef hand calcium-binding proteins  were up-regulated in h <dig>  and two genes encoding calb domain proteins  were down-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress, indicating their different roles in the drought stress response.

phytohormone related proteins:  <dig> genes encoding ten ja and six ga related proteins were differentially expressed in h <dig> vs. hhz under drought stress . kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis of these degs showed that alpha-linolenic acid metabolism , which is associated with ja synthesis, was highlighted in h <dig> . eight ja biosynthesis-related genes, encoding four lipoxygenase , one alpha-dioxygenase , one acyl-coa oxidase , one enoyl-coa hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase  and one acetyl-coa acyltransferase , were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress. meanwhile, two genes  involved in the ja signaling pathway were also significantly up-regulated in h <dig> vs. hhz under drought stress. consistently, the ja content in h <dig> was significantly higher than that in hhz under drought stress, even though the ja contents in all three genotypes were repressed by drought compared with their respective control . a ga biosynthesis-related gene, encoding putative gibberellin 20-oxidase  <dig>  was significantly up-regulated after 1 day of drought stress, while a ga deactivation-related gene encoding gibberellin 2-oxidase was evidently up-regulated after 3 days of drought stress in all genotypes. importantly, four putative gibberellin receptor encoded genes were detected to be differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress. these results indicated that the ja and ga pathway is involved in drought stress tolerance in the dt il h <dig> figure  <dig> 
jasmonic acid  related pathways may play key roles in drought tolerance in h <dig>   ja synthesis and signaling pathways that contain differentially expression patterns between h <dig> and hhz under drought conditions. gene names in red and green color indicate up- and down-regulated in response to drought stress, respectively.  hierarchical clustering of ja-related genes and some co-regulated genes. the color scale indicates the expression value.  ja contents in h <dig>  hhz, and p <dig> under drought conditions. each column represents mean ± s.d. ; **p < <dig> ; *p < <dig>  versus hhz .



transcription regulation related genes:  <dig> transcription factor  genes were differentially expressed between h <dig> and hhz under drought stress. among them, three ap2/erebp genes  were significantly up-regulated in h <dig>  which were previously identified to be highly involved in drought and salt stress <cit> ; oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  were highly expressed in h <dig> relative to hhz under drought; these two genes were associated with biotic stress tolerance in a previous study <cit> . the others included four myb tfs, five bhlh tfs, and seven nac proteins, most of which were up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought, implying their positive role in the drought stress response.

genes encoding redox regulation-related proteins: a set of  <dig> genes related to redox regulation were enriched in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress. these genes included those encoding ascorbate peroxidase, oxidoreductase, peroxidase precursor, glutathione s-transferase, and glutathione synthetase , showing that redox regulation is involved in the molecular mechanisms of drought stress tolerance.

genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and osmotic adjustment:  <dig> genes encoding udp-glucoronosyl and udp-glucosyl transferase  family proteins and genes encoding three osmotins and one malate synthase were differentially expressed in h <dig> vs. hhz under drought. these genes were previously reported to be involved in sugar metabolism and detoxification <cit>  and osmotic adjustment <cit> .

co-regulatory gene networks of h <dig> in response to drought stress
to explore the genetic networks associated with dt, all degs belonged to the above function categories in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress  were subjected to co-expression network analysis. forty of them were found to be co-regulated and formed a complex network . in this network, the genes could be separated into four groups according to their putative functions. group a was enriched in stress signaling transduction, including  <dig> genes encoding receptor kinases, protein kinases, and ca2+ related protein. four genes in group b were functionally involved in hormone signaling pathways: three genes encoding lipoxygenases  and one gene encoding ga20ox2; lox is involved in ja biosynthesis and signaling <cit> ; and ga20ox <dig> is related to the biosynthesis of gibberellin <cit> . the genes in group c were enriched in transcription regulation, including two nac, one myb, three cct/b-box zinc finger proteins, and one hlh type tfs. the group d genes were mainly involved in ion transport, including two high affinity k+ transporter 5 s, three abc transporters, and an atp synthase subunit c family protein; and redox homeostasis, including peroxidase superfamily proteins, two glutathione s-transferases, and one short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; and carbohydrate metabolism, including udp-glycosyltransferase and malate synthase. these co-regulated genes in group d were evidently downstream in the drought stress tolerance mechanism of h <dig> figure  <dig> 
co-regulatory networks of genes differentially modulated in h <dig> under drought stress . co-regulation analysis was based on the calculation of pairwise pearson correlation coefficient  of logarithmic expression values  in rice oligonucleotide array database. four subgroups, indicated with letters from a–d which also distinguished by shapes, were identified as their putative functions. different colors indicate genes with unique function class: olive, ca2+ signal related; gold, receptor kinase; blue, kinase; violet, tf; green, k + transporter; pink, redox regulation; black, osmotin; red, carbohydrate metabolism. the thickness of the edges is proportional to the pcc. asterisks indicate the genes located in the introgression segment from p <dig>  arrows indicate up- and down-regulated in response to drought stress, respectively; and  <dig>   <dig> and b with arrows show 1 day, 3 days, both  <dig> and 3 days drought stress, respectively.



colocalization of dt related degs in the introgression fragments and qtl intervals
according to the results of genotyping by resequencing,  <dig> p <dig> fragments were introgressed into h <dig> . we analyzed the previously reported dt-related qtls based on the gramene qtl database  compared with the introgression intervals in h <dig>  the results indicated that  <dig> known dt qtls were co-localized in the introgressed regions in h <dig> .figure  <dig> 
the recombination map of h <dig> and drought stress-related quantitative trait loci  located in or near the introgressed regions. names of qtls, differentially expressed genes and introgressed bins are shown on the sides of the chromosome, more details are provided in additional file <dig> 



correspondingly, all degs, including those differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz under control, 1 day or 3 days of drought stress conditions, were mapped onto the rice chromosome:  <dig> of these degs were localized on the introgressed intervals. furthermore,  <dig> degs were localized onto  <dig> dt-related qtl intervals that overlap with the introgressed fragments in h <dig> . seven genes on the introgressed region of chromosome  <dig> were detected to be significantly up-regulated in h <dig> relative to hhz after 3 days of drought stress: bhlh tf, lateral root primordium  protein, beta- <dig> -glucanase  <dig>  glycosyl hydrolase, glutathione s-transferase, and bidirectional amino acid transporter. several drought-related qtls, including those for leaf rolling, osmotic adjustment, and relative water content were colocalized on this region; thus, up-regulation of these seven genes in h <dig> could be positively related to physiological and metabolic adaptation to drought stress. there was also a cluster of  <dig> genes located on the introgressed segment of chromosome  <dig> that had no corresponding dt qtls. these genes included eight wall-associated kinase  family proteins and two cysteine-rich rlks were found to be constitutively down-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz. it was evidenced that waks and cysteine-rich rlks are essential for the normal regulation of cell enlargement and abiotic stress sensing <cit> , reduced expression of these genes in h <dig> might negatively affect cell growth and the stress response.

discussion
the dt il showed enhanced drought stress tolerance
ils have been widely used in genetic analysis and molecular breeding <cit> . drought-selected ils have provided a useful genetic resource to improve our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of dt in rice <cit> . in the present study, the dt il h <dig> and donor p <dig> were more tolerant to drought stress than the recurrent parent hhz. under drought stress, h <dig> and p <dig> showed delayed leaf rolling, lower rwl, higher rwc, higher stomatal closure rate, relatively lower cell membrane injury, and with significantly higher cat and apx activities than hhz, indicating that h <dig> and p <dig> underwent complex morphological and physiological changes to resist drought stress <cit> . these results showed that h <dig> and p <dig> used a typical dt strategy to cope with drought stress by limiting water loss and the enhanced dt of h <dig> over hhz was caused by introgression of favorable alleles from donor p <dig> 

genome-wide transcriptome reprogramming of h <dig> and its parental lines in response to time-series drought stress
a comparative transcriptome analysis of three genotypes under 1- and 3-day drought stress indicated that the dt and ds genotypes shared a large proportion of drought-induced degs, revealing common drought stress-responsive processes. go analyses showed that commonly up-regulated genes at the mr phase were highly enriched in signaling transduction and transcription regulation, consistent with previous reports that abiotic stress triggered the mr phase of transcriptome alterations of genes related to signaling cascades, including receptor kinases, transcription factors and components of calcium signaling <cit> . however, after 3 days of drought stress, the common degs were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolic process, post-translational protein modifications, transport, and redox regulation, implying that downstream genes related to metabolite adaptation, ros homeostasis, and post-transcriptional regulation were involved in the severe drought stress response, in accordance with previous results <cit> .

effect of introgression on the transcriptome in response to drought stress
the degs on the introgressed regions in h <dig> relative to its recurrent parent hhz could have direct effects on its dt phenotype changes. identification of those degs co-localized with identified dt-related qtls provides useful data for dt molecular breeding and gene functional dissection. meanwhile, it was reported that donor introgressions combine recurrent parental alleles that might result in novel changes in expression, and many genes showing non-parental expression patterns were identified outside of the introgressed fragments <cit> . in this study, a set of genes in the dt introgression line h <dig> were exclusively differentially expressed compared with its parental lines, especially under drought stress, showing a unique expression related to the dt phenotype. these expression changes beyond the introgression regions might correspond to the well-known transgressive or nonparental expression in hybrid crop plants <cit> . however, it was determined that the genome-wide expression changes in an il might result from activation of transposon mping <cit>  or transgressive sirna <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of this non-parental expression alteration, especially under drought stress, need to be further elucidated.

a complex genetic network including the ja and ga pathway is involved in drought stress tolerance
drought stress tolerance is a complex trait and involves many genes. hence, deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying dt in plants is a challenging task. genome-wide identification of drought-responsive regulons in contrasting dt genotypes with similar genetic backgrounds could help to dissect novel genetic components involved in dt. we comparatively analyzed the differential gene expression between h <dig> and hhz under drought stress:  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, indicating substantial transcriptome reprogramming in h <dig> under drought stress compared with hhz.

a set of genes related to signaling transduction including rks, cdpks, and cbps were up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz. rlks play an important role in plant growth and responses to abiotic stresses by activating initial signaling transduction <cit> ; cdpks and cbps are the main components in the stress signaling pathway, which acts by modulating aba signaling and reducing the accumulation of ros <cit> . up-regulation of these genes in h <dig> implied their positive role in dt by enhancing signaling pathways under drought stress.

plant hormones, including aba, ga and ja, play key roles in their ability to adapt to changing environments <cit> . go and kegg analyses revealed that genes related to ja biosynthesis and the signaling pathway were differentially expressed in h <dig> relative to hhz under drought stress, implying that ja was involved in drought response. ja plays an important role in plant growth, development and stress response <cit> . the ja signaling and biosynthesis genes were found to be significantly regulated by drought in arabidopsis <cit>  and rice <cit> . in this study, the ja levels in all three genotypes were repressed by drought compared with their control, this result indicated that ja is probably not required at high concentration under drought stress, and an increase in ja content might negatively affect plant growth as suggested by previous reports <cit> . however, the ja content was significantly higher in h <dig> than in hhz and p <dig> under drought stress, which correlated with the increased expression of ja biosynthesis genes in h <dig> relative to hhz, demonstrating that ja plays an important role in dt. previous studies indicated that ja affected the transcript levels of genes related to antioxidants under water stress <cit> ; relative higher ja content in h <dig> might enhance drought tolerance by modulating antioxidant homeostasis.

it was shown that ja could interact synergistically and antagonistically with other phytohormones <cit> . in this study, differentially expressed ga-related genes in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress provide evidence for the role of ga metabolism and the regulation of the ga signaling pathway on exposure to drought stress which consistent with latest study. emerging evidence for interaction of the ga-signaling molecule della with components of the signaling pathway for the stress hormone ja <cit>  suggests that ga signaling might integrate multiple hormone signaling pathways in response to drought stress, however the crossroads of these interactions still remain to be elucidated.

tfs are hub regulators in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. several tfs, including ap2/erebps, wrkys, bhlhs, and nacs, were highly up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz under drought stress. all these tfs were previously reported to be involved in transcription regulation of abiotic stresses tolerance <cit> . importantly, ap2/erebps, wrkys, and nacs are key regulators of aba-mediated stomatal closure and, hence, drought responses <cit> . bhlhs play an important role in the ja-mediated regulatory network of the abiotic stress response <cit> . differential expression of these tfs in h <dig> relative to hhz implied that both aba and ja play a central role in regulating drought stress tolerance in h <dig> 

co-expression analysis showed that there were core dt genes forming a complex network in h <dig> , including genes related to signaling transduction, the ja pathway, and tfs, and those involved in downstream functions, such as carbohydrate metabolism, ion transport, and ros regulation. in the network, a bhlh tf  is connected to a receptor-like kinase  and a hub 5-amp-activated protein kinase , interacts with glutathione s-transferase , lz-nbs-lrr protein , and peroxidase , and is then further connected with two ja biosynthesis lipoxygenases . all these genes form a complex interacting network. however, their real interactions need to be confirmed by further experiments, including yeast-two-hybridization screening. these co-expressed gene networks provide useful information for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying drought stress tolerance in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a dt il and its parental lines, including the dt donor and ds recurrent parent, were used to characterize the differences of leaf transcriptome dynamics under  <dig> and 3 days of drought stress at the tillering stage using high-throughput rna sequencing. drought induced transcriptome reprogramming in a dt il h <dig> could result from introgressed chromosome segments from the dt donor p <dig>  and the differentially expressed genes in the h <dig> relative to the hhz under drought stress might contribute to the enhanced drought tolerance, finally improved yield performance under stress. co-expression analysis revealed a complex regulatory network, including genes related to the signaling transduction, ja and ga pathways, transcription regulation, redox control and osmotic adjustment, involved in drought stress tolerance. the data obtained in this study could extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of dt in rice.
