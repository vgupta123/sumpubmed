BACKGROUND
orange juice is among the largest beverage industries in the world. sweet orange is mainly produced in the subtropical areas in the countries of china, us and brazil and the mediterranean basin regions. sweet orange  belongs to the citrus genus that includes several other species such as tangerine, mandarin and grapefruit. in horticultural practice, citrus is asexually propagated through grafting the scion onto the stock which is grown through the seeds. the scion has been bred for the desired traits of fruit quality while the stock is mostly selected for supporting the optimal scion growth and increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

among the major biotic factors which frequently challenge tree growth and fruit development, huanglongbing  or called citrus greening is one of the most destructive diseases. hlb was first reported in  <dig> in southern china, and very recently it has been reported in almost all major citrus production areas  <cit> . for example, in florida alone, hlb has caused the loss of several billion dollars since  <dig> when hlb was first reported, ranging from 30–100% of loss in fruit production in citrus groves  <cit> . hlb is caused by infection of the bacterium, candidatus liberibacter spp., which is spread to plants via the vector asian citrus psyllid  or through grafting of a diseased shoot. the hlb bacterium has three species, ca. liberibacter asiaticus , ca. liberibacter africanus  and ca. liberibacter americanus . the genome of the las species was recently published, with a size of approximately  <dig>  mb  <cit> . it has been generally accepted that, after infection or inoculation, the hlb bacteria migrate through phloem and, by accumulating there, causes the formation of sieve plug  <cit> . consequently, the transport of nutrients  from the source leaves to various sinks  are compromised or even blocked in severely infected plants, leading to the alterations in carbohydrate metabolism for metabolic flow and exhibiting such phenotypes as yellow and blotchy mottles on leaves, variegated fruits and poor root growth  <cit> . because of the huge impact of hlb in the citrus industry, plant pathologists and horticulturists have long sought after the hlb resistance mechanism in citrus.

a recent survey suggests the existence of genetic variations among different citrus species, varieties and stocks  <cit> . in general, mandarin, sweet orange and grapefruit are relatively more susceptible to the hlb bacterial infection, while sour orange, lemon, lime, and citrange  are less susceptible. this raises the possibility that hlb resistance can be achieved through genetic means. nevertheless, breeding for the hlb resistance through crossing will be a daunting task, given the complex genetic backgrounds, the nature of asexual propagation and the relatively long juvenile period for citrus. therefore, many researchers have turned their attentions to finding the target genes that are required or critical for the citrus host response to the hlb bacteria. transcriptome analysis has been used as a straight forward approach to identify the genes whose expression is altered in citrus leaves in response to the hlb inoculation  <cit> . these studies led to the identification of several hundred or thousand genes that are up- or down-regulated by the hlb bacterial infection. the majority of these genes can be grouped into metabolism, transport and response to stimulus. however, these studies varied significantly in terms of study design  and data analysis . furthermore, there is a lack of comparison of the results from these different experiments. in addition, how these hlb bacterium-regulated genes are connected in a system remains unknown.

to provide a systems view of citrus response to the hlb bacterial infection, we first performed a comparative study of the previously reported transcriptome datasets. our results show that there are  <dig> probe sets  are commonly up-regulated and a number of genes that are specific to early, late or very late stages of inoculation. furthermore, using the pearson correlation coefficient -based unweighted gene coexpression analysis, we constructed an hlb response network. this citrus gene coexpression network consists of  <dig>  probesets and  <dig>  interactions. we then mapped certain categories of the hlb responsive genes to the hlb response network, resulting in the formation of several important subnetworks including metabolism, transport, signaling, defense response and hormone response. taken together, through comparative transcriptome analysis and construction of a citrus gene coexpression analysis, we have provided a systems view of citrus response to the ca. liberibacter infection causing hlb.

RESULTS
an overview of comparative analysis of hlb transcriptomes
to perform a comparative transcriptome study, we decided to use the same data pre-processing and statistical analysis methods and the same selection criteria for the identification of hlb significantly regulated genes. two sets of the citrus affymetrix genechip data derived from very recent publications  <cit>  were retrieved from the ncbi gene expression omnibus  database, while the data for the two earlier reports were provided by drs. bowman  <cit>  and wang  <cit> , respectively. these four reports represent six different studies that can be used for individual comparisons, with a total of  <dig> arrays . in these studies, genome-wide gene expression was profiled from the citrus leaves inoculated by the hlb bacterium las. however, these six studies can be categorized into three distinct hlb disease stages . because the three studies used the leaf samples 30– <dig> weeks after inoculation, we arbitrarily called this “very late” stage by following the definition of “early”  and “late” stages  described in the first hlb transcriptome study  <cit> .


the citrus genechip contains a total of  <dig>  probesets. because the affymetrix company has not provided a comprehensive annotation analysis for those probesets, it is not known how many unique citrus genes are actually represented in the chip. therefore, we decided to analyze the number of probesets that are significantly regulated in response to hlb. the data pre-processing was described in methods. in brief, those probesets with the calls of present  or marginal  in at least two chips in each of the four reports were included in our analysis. for the identification of significantly regulated genes, the adjusted lpe approach was used because of its power in analyzing small samples  <cit> . in our analysis, a two-fold cutoff was used, resulting in various numbers of genes that were either up- or down-regulated in each of the six studies . the hlb regulated genes for each study were listed in additional file  <dig>  if the genes significantly regulated in at least one study were added together, we found that a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  probesets were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. these probesets are called “hlb responsive genes” in this study . the percentage of “hlb responsive genes” identified in this comparative analysis  is similar to that of the bacterial pathogen responsive genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . this indicates that either the disease response mechanism could be somehow conserved or these four reports have probably identified most of the hlb responsive genes in the citrus genome. surprisingly, the study-wise comparison showed that the proportion of the significantly regulated genes overlapped in two of the six studies varied dramatically  .

comparative studies reveal commonly regulated and stage-specifically regulated genes by hlb
despite our finding that only a small proportion of probesets are significantly regulated in any of two studies, we reasoned that those probesets  commonly regulated in all of the studies may represent either a common core pathway or default pathway in response to the las infection. we first found a total of  <dig> probesets that are commonly up-regulated in all of the six studies , representing only  <dig> %  of the hlb up-regulated genes. however, the number of probesets significantly regulated in any of five studies increased to  <dig>  it is possible that in the absence of the hlb bacterial challenge some of the hlb up-regulated genes already had higher transcript levels in the relatively resistant germplasm us- <dig> compared to the relatively susceptible mandarin cleopatra and thus they were not up-regulated any more in us- <dig> in response to the las infection; however, they could be significantly regulated in all other four studies. we did identify a total of eight probesets for this type of expression pattern and consequently they were also added to the list of the hlb commonly regulated genes . surprisingly, there was no probeset commonly down-regulated in all of the six studies and only one probeset that is significantly down-regulated in five studies. this probeset, cit. <dig> .s1_at, is annotated to encode a gene similar to arabidopsis at5g18600-encoded glutaredoxin family protein involved in cell redox homeostasis. gene ontology  analysis of the subset of  <dig> commonly up-regulated probesets indicates that metabolism , transport , hormone responses  and unknown processes  are the largest groups. the three probesets representing the genes involved in hormone response indicate that gibberelic acid , abscisic acid , auxin, ethylene and jasmonic acid  may have certain role in mediating the citrus response to hlb. interestingly, three probesets  belonging to the category of “unknown process” might also be involved in ethylene response as they exhibit the highest homology to genes that are associated with ethylene response using the manual blast search. in addition, there is a transcription factor gene represented by the probeset, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at  and another putative rap <dig> -like ethylene transcription factor represented by cit. <dig> .s1_s_at. taken together, the existence of these commonly up-regulated genes strongly indicates that metabolism, transport, hormone response and transcriptional regulation play a critical role and may define the default or basal pathways in citrus during the whole process of the las infection.


the first section contains  <dig> probesets up-regulated in all six studies. the second section includes eight probesets up-regulated in five studies  but their expression was higher in us- <dig> than in cleopatra. atgid, arabidopsis gene id.

in contrast to the commonly regulated genes in hlb response, we found various numbers of stage-specifically regulated genes as this group of genes were only regulated at a particular stage. there are  <dig> and  <dig> probesets that are respectively up-regulated and down-regulated only at early stage, and thus they belong to the group of early stage-specific genes . in this early stage-specific group, the genes encoding components involved in cell wall metabolism and transcription are of particular interest. first, there are six probesets that could potentially represent the genes involved in cell wall biogenesis or property . second, five probesets represent the transcription factors homologous to arabidopsis erf <dig> , ataf <dig> and arr <dig> . in addition, cit. <dig> .s1_at represents a gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase family protein, which might be involved in global transcriptional control through chromatin remodeling. this result implies that transcriptional control and cell wall property regulation are among the early events in citrus in response to the hlb bacterial attack.


fc, fold changes; atgid, arabidopsis gene id.

in addition,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated probesets are specific to the “late” stage of las infection . interestingly, these probesets represent some genes that belong to the categories of metabolism of carbohydrate, nitrogen and lipids, hormone iaa metabolism, response to chemical stimulus, endomembrane systems and extracellular regions. in addition, while several genes involved in cell wall property regulation  are up-regulated, some genes encoding transcription factors  and protein kinases are down-regulated. the most striking feature is that only seven probesets represent the very late stage-specific genes . these include the genes that are most closely related to arabidopsis c domain containing protein  <dig> , a copper-binding family protein, a trypsin and protease inhibitor family protein/kunitz family protein, a myosin heavy chain-related protein, two basic chitinase  and one unknown protein encoded by at1g <dig>  the small number of genes belonging to this very late stage-specific category is likely due to the various experimental conditions because only  <dig> probesets are commonly up- or down-regulated even in the four studies within the same very late stage of las infection . nevertheless, as this group of genes were identified from four studies specifically at the very late stage compared to only one study for early and late stages respectively, they could be more reliable than groups of early- and late-stage-specific genes.

construction and characterization of gene coexpression network for citrus response to hlb
to provide a systems view of citrus host response to the hlb bacterial infection, the pearson correlation coefficient  method was used to infer the gene coexpression network using the four datasets reported in the four transcriptomic studies  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  probesets, which are present  in at least two chips of the transcriptomic studies with strong expression and/or belong to the group of the hlb responsive genes , were used for network analysis . this number represents 35% of  <dig>  probesets in the citrus genechip. pcc was computed between each pair of these probesets. a pcc threshold of  <dig>  was selected, based on the overall consideration of changes in node number, edge number and network density . the signed scale free r <dig> plot analysis  suggests that this selection has a good scale-free topology fit, as the r <dig> value of  <dig>  indicates that the topology of the hlb response network is quite similar to most biological networks. the resulting citrus gene coexpression network  contains  <dig>  nodes  with  <dig>  edges  .


we next determined the robustness of our network across each dataset using the cross-validation approach. we randomly left out one dataset and reconstructed the gene co-expression networks using the remaining three datasets. the resulting four networks were then compared to the network based on all four datasets in terms of network connectivity rank of each gene according to the suggestion described elsewhere  <cit> . there were strong, highly significant connectivity correlations  between the network based on all four datasets and the ones reconstructed from any combination of the three datasets. this suggests a high degree of preservation of gene co-expression patterns across the networks based on different datasets.

we then analyzed in detail the characteristics of the hlb response network. first, the frequency distribution of edges for each node was determined. as shown in figure  <dig>  the network contains  <dig> probesets that are orphan nodes,  <dig> probesets that have only one interaction, and the majority of the nodes  that have at least three interactions  and, by following geisler-lee et al.  <cit> , are called hubs in this paper. among the  <dig>  probesets , the majority have 3– <dig> edges , and the remaining  <dig> probesets  have 101– <dig> interactions, while only 1%  have more than  <dig> interactions. overall, the mean number of interactions for each probeset is  <dig>  with the maximum of interactions being  <dig> . cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a gene most closely related to arabidopsis syp <dig> encoding a plant syntaxin which functions as a plasma membrane- associated protein transporter.


second, we performed a go enrichment analysis for the probesets in the hlb response network. among  <dig>  probesets,  <dig>   have the arabidopsis gene id  as their closest orthologs or homologs . therefore, these probesets were assigned go terms based on the most recent arabidopsis go assignment. the remaining probesets were given three general go terms: “biological process” , “molecular function” , and “cellular component” . go enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric statistical method with the hochberg false discovery rate  adjustment showed that many go terms were overrespresented in the hlb response network. among the overrepresented go terms , the nodes belonging to the following six categories were color coded in the hlb response network : carbohydrate metabolic process , nitrogen and amino acid metabolic process , transport , defense response , hormone response  and signaling . the nodes for each of these six categories, together with the nodes belonging to some highly overrepresented go terms such as response to stress, lipid metabolic process, cell wall and membrane part, were listed in additional file  <dig>  the p-values of the overrepresented go terms were listed in additional file  <dig> 

we also performed a go enrichment analysis for the hub genes. we arbitrarily divided the  <dig>  hubs into two categories: minor hubs  and major hubs  and their overrepresented go terms were summarized in additional file  <dig>  the major hubs have  <dig> overrepresented go terms: carbohydrate metabolic process, primary metabolic process, metabolic process, secondary metabolic process, lipid metabolic process, cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process, cellular process, localization, transport, establishment of localization, regulation of anatomical structure size, regulation of cell size, and regulation of cellular component size. in addition to these  <dig> go terms, the minor hubs have  <dig> additional overrepresented go terms, such as response to stimulus , response to stress, regulation of biological quality and signal transduction.

analysis of the defense and hormone response subnetworks
given the importance of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, transport, signaling, defense response and hormone response in the citrus response to the hlb bacterial infection and in general plant defense response, the subnetworks for these six categories were constructed by mapping the probesets belonging to these categories into the hlb response network. the resulting edges  were listed in additional file  <dig> 

we first analyzed the hlb defense subnetwork. as shown in figure 3a, the probesets representing defense, hormone response and signaling were color-coded. clearly, the large hubs belong to the categories of defense and hormonal responses but not signaling. interestingly, several of the hormone response hubs are also defense response hubs as these hubs are involved in both responses . for example, the probesets cit. <dig> .s1_s_at and cit. <dig> .s1_at represent a transcription factor closest to the arabidopsis at2g37630-encoded as <dig> , which is annotated as both response to fungus, virus, bacterium and salt stresses and response to hormones such as auxin, ga, sa and ja  <cit> . interestingly, these hubs were connected to other large defense hubs such as cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, which represents a lipid transporter closest to arabidopsis dir <dig> , cit. <dig> .s1_at, which represents a fer  protein kinase-like gene, and cit. <dig> .s1_at, which represents an ep3-like chitinase gene. cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, cit. <dig> .s <dig>  cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, and cit. <dig> .s1_at were shown to be down-regulated by the las infections in two reports  <cit>  . another example is cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, which represents a protein degradation component similar to arabidopsis csn5a  and is assigned the go terms of both auxin response and defense response  <cit> . this hub is interconnected to at least two large defense hubs, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at  and cit. <dig> .s1_at . however, there is one hormone  response hub, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, which represents nicotinamidase similar to arabidopsis nic <dig>  and is linked to at least three defense hubs. one of the connecting hub genes, cit. <dig> .s1_at, is closest to arabidopsis rlp <dig> , and another two hubs, cit. <dig> .s1_at and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, represent ep3-like chitinase genes. although cit. <dig> .s1_s_at itself is not hlb responsive, the above three defense hubs to which it connects were reported to be up-regulated in some of the transcriptomic studies .


the finding that the defense and hormone hubs are intertwined or overlapped  indicates a potentially important role for hormones in the hlb response in citrus. also given by the increasingly clear roles for some hormones such as ethylene, aba, ja and sa in plant defense response, we decided to analyze in more detail the hormone response subnetwork. in the hlb response network, go terms for the response to auxin, ga, aba, ethylene, ja and sa are overrepresented  based on the hypergeometric method provided in the agrigo web tool  <cit>  and thus the nodes for these go terms are color-coded in the hormone response subnetwork  and listed in additional file  <dig>  it should be noted that four  of these six overrepresented hormone go terms are also determined to be overrepresented by using several algorithms implemented in the r package topgo which are proposed to eliminate local dependencies between go terms  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that sa signaling is important for both local disease resistance and systemic acquired resistance  <cit>  and a recent report showed the success in engineering the npr1-mediated sa signaling pathway to improve citrus resistance to another destructive disease canker  <cit> . therefore, we used the sa response subnetwork as an example of performing the specific hormone response network analysis. using  <dig> sa response probesets as the seed nodes, we constructed the sa response subnetwork consisting of  <dig> probesets and  <dig> interactions . in the sa response subnetwork, there are two major subsets, each with several large hubs. the first major subset contains transcription factors similar to arabidopsis as <dig>  and wrky <dig> , protein degradation component ubq <dig>  and carbohydrate metabolic enzyme gstu <dig> . the second major subset of the sa response subnetwork has two large hubs, both of which represent the ubq10-like protein degradation component. a further analysis on this subset revealed that besides the two ubq <dig> hubs, two other transcription factors closest to as <dig>  and myb <dig>  serve as smaller hubs linking the larger ubq <dig> hubs . wrky, myb and as1-like transcription factors have been reported to play important roles in arabidopsis defense responses  <cit> . ubiqutin-mediated proteasome has also been shown to be critical for plant disease resistance  <cit> . accumulating evidence suggest that wrky, myb and as1-controlled transcriptional events and ubiqutin-mediated proteasomal degradation are critical for sa signaling  <cit> . therefore, these results strongly indicate that protein degradation and transcriptional regulation are likely critical regulatory processes involved in sa response in citrus when challenged with the las infection.


analysis of the early stage hlb response subnetwork
at early stage, the hlb bacterium could rarely be detected, nor any hlb symptom observed, but the response to hlb in citrus could occur early at least at the transcriptional level. therefore, we decided to analyze the subnetwork for the early-stage hlb responsive genes. a total of  <dig> probesets, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated probesets , were used as the seed nodes to map the hlb response network, resulting in the hlb early response subnetwork . this subnetwork based on the first degree neighbors of these seed nodes contains  <dig> probesets and  <dig> interactions . among those probesets,  <dig> are involved in carbohydrate metabolic process,  <dig> in nitrogen and amino acid metabolic process,  <dig> in transport,  <dig> in defense response,  <dig> in signaling and  <dig> in hormone response. go enrichment analysis shows that carbohydrate metabolic process , transport  and defense  are overrepresented. although the hormone response category is not overrepresented, ja response consisting  <dig> probesets is overrepresented with a p-value of  <dig> ). therefore, our analysis of the early stage subnetwork indicates that even at this stage , several important biological processes have been activated or inactivated. in the hlb early response subnetwork, there is only one subset that has several large hubs, while all other small subsets have interactions that are not connected further . to provide further detail of the early stage response in citrus, we analyzed the two nodes in the large subset of this subnetwork, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at.


cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a triacylglycerol lipase gene most closely related to arabidopsis eds <dig>   <cit> . extracting this eds1-like gene from the hlb early response subnetwork  shows that eds <dig> interacts with  <dig> probesets . among these probesets, one probeset  has interactions with only two other probesets, five probesets  form the large hubs each with 50– <dig> interactions, and nine other probesets form the medium-size hubs with 11– <dig> interactions. the fact that cit. <dig> .s1_at connects with the five large hubs indicates a potentially critical role in citrus response to the hlb bacterial infection. cit. <dig> .s1_at represents a carbohydrate transmembrane transporter or phosphate transmembrane transporter, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at is closely related to cb5-e  involved in heme binding, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a putative cc-nbs-lrr class disease resistance protein, and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at is very similar to arabidopsis hmgb <dig>  involved in transcriptional control through chromatin remodeling. in addition, some of the medium-size hubs that interact with the eds1-like gene play important roles in protein modifications or lipid metabolism. for example, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at is closely related to arabidopsis sag <dig>  which encodes a carboxylesterase or triacylglycerol lipase and has been shown to physically interact with eds <dig>  <cit> , and cit. <dig> .s1_x_at is similar to ubq <dig> . the eds1-like citrus gene was up-regulated at the early stage  and at the very late stage  in only one of the four studies  <cit> , and most of  <dig> hub genes that interact with the citrus eds1-like gene were also up-regulated by the las infection in some of the studies with the exception of cit. <dig> .s1_x_at , cit. <dig> .s1_s_at  and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at  . therefore, the finding that so many hlb responsive hub genes in citrus connect to eds <dig>  which is critical for disease resistance in arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> , indicates that eds1-mediated defense response mechanism might be important in citrus response to the hlb bacterial infection at least at early stage.


cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a transcription factor most closely related to arabidopsis nac <dig>  mapping this probeset as the seed node to the hlb response network with the second degree neighbors resulted in an nac <dig> subnetwork . two medium-size hubs were identified in this subnetwork: cit. <dig> .s1_x_at and cit. <dig> .s1_at, both of which were up-regulated transcriptionally by the las infection . cit. <dig> .s1_x_at represents a ga-responsive gast <dig> homolog and has been reported to be responsive to other hormones such as br and aba  <cit> . cit. <dig> .s1_at has interactions with  <dig> probesets and is closely related to at1g <dig> which encodes arabidopsis tetratricopeptide repeat -like superfamily protein and is responsive to oxidative stress  <cit> . given that both ga response and oxidative stress response have been implicated an important role in a relatively resistant variety us- <dig> in response to the las infection at the very late stage  <cit> , our preliminary analysis of the nac <dig> subnetwork supports that transcriptional control involving hormone response and oxidative stress response might also be important even at the early stage of the hlb bacterial attack.

subnetwork analysis reveals transport process as a key component in the hlb response core subnetwork
it is likely that the commonly up-regulated genes can define a default or core response pathway for citrus plants to resist the attack by the hlb bacteria; we therefore attempted to address whether there is a common subnetwork that could be affected by hlb. we mapped  <dig> commonly up-regulated probesets into the hlb response network, resulting in the formation of the hlb core subnetwork . this subnetwork based on the first degree neighbors contains  <dig> probesets and  <dig> interactions . the hub gene analysis shows that the subnetwork has eight large hubs, all of which were up-regulated, and four small hubs . among six categories of biological processes analyzed in the hlb response network, transport and carbohydrate metabolic process were overpresented in this core subnetwork . the probesets belonging to the three categories, carbohydrate metabolic process, transport and hormone response, were then color-coded in this subnetwork . the largest category of the genes in the subnetwork belongs to transport process, with a total of  <dig> probesets . among these probesets, four form the large hubs: cit. <dig> .s1_s_at, cit. <dig> .s1_at, cit. <dig> .s1_x_at, and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at. given the importance of hub genes in the biological networks and overrepresentation of transport in the subnetwork, we propose that transport process is a key component in the hlb response core subnetwork.


there are  <dig> probesets grouped into the category of carbohydrate metabolic process and  <dig> probesets that belong to the hormone response category. for the category of carbohydrate metabolic process, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at forms a larger hub with  <dig> interactions, and cit. <dig> .s1_at forms a smaller hub with seven interactions. cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a citrus gene similar to arabidopsis apl <dig> encoding a glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. cit. <dig> .s1_at represents a gene closely related to bglu <dig>  hydrolysis of o-glycosyl compounds. for the hormone response category, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at forms a larger hub with  <dig> interactions, and cit. <dig> .s1_x_at and cit. <dig> .s1_s_at form smaller hubs with seven and six interactions respectively. as described above, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a gene closely related to lox <dig> encoding a lipoxygenase and exhibiting response to ja. in arabidopsis, lox <dig> has also been shown to be involved in ja biosynthesis in response to wounding  <cit>  and recently in disease development  <cit> . as described previously, cit. <dig> .s1_x_at represents a ga-responsive gast <dig> homolog and is connected to the nac <dig> transcription factor subnetwork in the hlb early response subnetwork . interestingly, cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a gene very similar to arabidopsis wbc <dig>  which encodes an atpase coupled to transmembrane movement of substances or fatty acid transporter  <cit> . this small hub is responsive to aba and salt stress but is also involved in fatty acid transport, implying a potential role for hormone signaling in the control of transport process.

the remaining two large hubs in the hlb response core subnetwork are formed by cit. <dig> .s1_s_at and cit. <dig> .s1_at. cit. <dig> .s1_s_at represents a putative o-methyltransferase family  <dig> protein most closely related to the protein encoded by at4g <dig>  at4g <dig> is only annotated as a general go term “methylation”, and predicted to contain a winged helix-turn-helix transcription repressor dna-binding domain without any functional implication. this hub includes  <dig> interactions, and most of the interactions are with the probesets related to transport process. cit. <dig> .s1_at represents a gene closest to at4g <dig> which encodes a glutaredoxin family protein. it connects to a transportor hub through cit.  <dig> .s1_at  and the two hormone response hubs through cit. <dig> .s1_at . in arabidopsis, at4g33040-encoded glutaredoxin family protein is annotated as a protein involved in cell redox homeostasis, which could have a potential role in response to oxidation stress.

analysis of a phloem protein subnetwork implicates a potential role for zinc transport in the citrus hlb defense response
given the potential importance of phloem protein  <dig> -type lectin in phloem morphogenesis in particular the formation of sieve plug  <cit> , pp2-like protein genes in citrus were used as an example to further illustrate the application of the hlb response network. a survey of ten pp2-like genes present in the citrus genechip showed that four of the pp2-like genes were up-regulated and one down-regulated . although their expression pattern was quite different, one gene represented by the probeset cit. <dig> .s1_at was dramatically up-regulated at late stage  and very late stage  in all of the four reports  <cit>  except for the relatively resistant variety us- <dig> which did not exhibit any activation at very late stage . this gene is closely related to arabidopsis pp2-b <dig>  this probeset and the other, cit. <dig> .s1_s_a, are present in the hlb response network. the latter one represents a pp2-a15-like gene but expression of this gene was not affected by hlb in any of the four reports and it only connects with three genes in the hlb response network . the lack of activation of cit. <dig> .s1_at by the las infection at the early stage might be due to that the hlb symptom has not been fully developed yet. when the pp2-b <dig> subnetwork was constructed, we found that this gene connects with  <dig> probesets  which are interconnected frequently between each other . furthermore, seven of the  <dig> first degree interacting probesets represent the genes involved in transport, and three of these genes are predicted to encode zinc transporters . in addition, four probesets represent genes encoding zinc-binding proteins. given that hlb disease symptom was initially thought to be related to zinc deficiency  <cit> , our network analysis approach provides an intriguing possibility for zinc transporters or zinc-binding proteins to function in citrus response to the hlb bacterial infection.


discussion
the transcriptomes in citrus in response to the hlb bacterial infection have been well documented in four previous reports  <cit> , but the information regarding the interactions between the differentially expressed genes is lacking. through the combination of transcriptome comparative study and gene coexpression network analysis, we have provided for the first time a systems view of how the citrus host plant exerts a genome-wide response to the hlb bacterial infection.

first, we have constructed an hlb response network involving  <dig>  probesets with  <dig>  interactions. using the transcriptome datasets and orthology-based or experimentally verified protein-protein interaction datasets, gene-gene interactions or interactomes have been constructed in the model plants including arabidopsis and rice  and occasionally in non-model plants such as soybean  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . however, there was no report on gene-gene interaction networks in citrus prior to our work. we used the pcc method to construct a gene coexpression network in citrus, with a focus on the hlb response mechanism. the citrus gene coexpression network will be very useful for the citrus researchers to visualize the subnetworks specific for certain biological processes , or to search some potential gene-gene interactions for certain genes or a group of genes in the future. the citrus gene interaction networks  database has been constructed and made available to the research community to query through the internet .

second, our analysis of the defense subnetwork has shown that many defense hubs and hormone hubs are intertwined or overlapped. although the roles of hormone and defense response genes have been discussed in the four previous reports  <cit> , our network analysis further indicates that hormone response is interconnected to defense response in citrus when challenged by the hlb bacteria. this may lead to the development of integrating hormone and disease response pathways as a potentially more effective genetic means to improve the citrus resistance to hlb.

third, our comparative studies of transcriptomes have led to the identification of subsets of commonly up-regulated and stage-specific hlb responsive genes. in contrast to those four genechip reports where various statistical methods and fold-change cutoffs were used, we used the same procedure for the analysis of all of the transcriptome datasets. furthermore, by mapping the subset of commonly up-regulated genes into the hlb response network, we have found that the genes belonging to the categories of carbohydrate metabolic process, transport and hormone response are positioned as the large hubs in the hlb response core subnetwork. this indicates that these three processes constitute a core subnetwork for the citrus host response to the hlb bacterial infection. in addition, we propose that transport is a key component in this hlb response core subnetwork.

fourth, using pp <dig> gene as an example of applying the hlb response network, our subnetwork analysis provides an intriguing possibility for the zinc transporter or zinc binding proteins to act with pp <dig> protein in response to the hlb bacterial infection. pp <dig> proteins belong to a large gene family in higher plants. however, they have not been assigned a specific biological process, and thus their biological function remains unknown. they are predicted to bind carbohydrates and have been implicated a role in the formation of sieve plug or replacement phloem  <cit> . some of the pp <dig> genes from other organisms such as melon, cucumber and arabidopsis are specifically or preferentially expressed in companion cells but their protein products are translocated in sieve elements  <cit> . this indicates a role for pp <dig> proteins not only in intracellular signaling but also in long distance intercellular communication  <cit> . recent evidence show that pp2-type proteins might be involved in aphid-mediated virus transmission in cucumber  <cit>  and overexpression of pp2-a <dig> in arabidopsis increased resistance to a phloem-feeding insect  <cit> , indicating a possibly more active role for pp <dig> family proteins in defense response in plants. in citrus, the probeset cit. <dig> .s1_at, which is closely related to arabidopsis pp2-b <dig>  was dramatically up-regulated at late stage and very late stages. the most surprising feature of the pp2-b <dig> subnetwork is that the  <dig> probesets, which are the first degree neighbors of cit. <dig> .s1_at, are interconnected frequently between each other. this indicates that these genes might be regulated by the precise coordination of various signaling pathways through transcription factors, chromatin modification or remodeling proteins or other factors. furthermore, seven of the  <dig> interacting probesets encode proteins involved in transport, consistent with our proposal that transport is a key component in the hlb response core subnetwork. in addition, three of the seven transporters are predicted to transport zinc, and the pp <dig> subnetwork also contains four probesets which represent the genes encoding zinc-binding proteins. intriguingly, hlb disease symptom was initially thought to be related to zinc deficiency and the zinc transport system is required for virulence in other organisms  <cit> , and therefore the pp <dig> subnetwork analysis indicates that zinc transporters or zinc binding proteins may have a potentially important role for citrus to respond to the hlb bacterial infection. taken together, our analysis using the hlb response network can lead to an intriguing but testable hypothesis  regarding the role of pp <dig> proteins and zinc transport system or zinc binding proteins in citrus hlb defense response.

it should be noted that there are some potential limitations in our network study. the first one is go enrichment analysis. the agrigo web tool, which is based on the hypergeometric method and used in this work, does not take into account the local dependency of go terms. using the four algorithms provided in the topgo r package which are proposed to eliminate local dependencies, we have found that four of the six hormone go terms determined to be overrepresented by agrigo are also overrepresented, while the two other hormones  have their child go terms being truly overrepresented. therefore, different algorithms or statistical methods in go enrichment analysis will probably lead to some differences in terms of the overrepresented go terms for the nodes in the hlb response network.

the second limitation is due to the small sample size. computational prediction of gene-gene interactions usually requires large sample size; however relatively small number of samples were recently used to construct gene coexpression networks specific to certain aspects of biology . in our analysis, we used the transcriptome datasets described in four previous reports  <cit> . among these, only one study is available for early stage and late stage respectively, while there are four studies for very late stage . we have found that only a small number  of significantly regulated probesets can be identified for early stage, while almost  <dig> and  <dig> – <dig>  differentially expressed probesets can be found for late and very late stages respectively. the variation in the number of differentially expressed genes at different stages could be caused by the difference in experimental conditions given that different ages and varieties of trees and different sources of inoculants were used in different years in those four reports. however, this variation might lead to some sort of bias towards the very late stage genes. to minimize the possibility that the interactions we have detected were the result of random events due to the small sample size, we have selected a high pcc cutoff value which has led us to believe that the interactions are more likely statistically significant rather than by random and that the topology of the hlb response network is quite similar to most biological networks. furthermore, the cross-validation result shows a high degree of preservation of gene coexpression patterns, suggesting that the hlb response network is at least moderately robust and biologically relevant. therefore, despite some limitations due to the small sample size and the experimental variations, the network reported here should be quite useful for the citrus research community and have provided some novel insights into the citrus hlb defense mechanisms. when larger scale transcriptome datasets become available in the future, similar network analysis will provide a comprehensive picture of the gene networks in citrus.

the most daunting challenge in the citrus postgenomic era remains how to identify the best candidate genes for functional dissection of the hlb response mechanism and for genetic modification with an ultimate goal of improving the hlb resistance in citrus. genetic variations of hlb susceptibility  <cit>  clearly shows the potential towards dissection of genetic mechanisms of hlb resistance, but understanding the inheritance patterns and subsequently cloning the disease genes requires a long term effort because of long juvenile phase and complex reproductive biology for citrus. recent developments have shed some lights into the identification of key hub genes as candidate regulatory genes. for example, a seed germination study found that 22–50% of the arabidopsis hub genes identified from the seed germination network actually have physiological functions in the control of seed germination  <cit> . therefore, the hub genes identified in this report may potentially be the first batch of candidates for the functional test in hlb resistance in citrus.

CONCLUSIONS
through integration of transcriptome comparison and gene coexpression network analysis, we have provided novel insights into the mechanism by which citrus host plants respond to the hlb bacterial infection. specifically, several biological processes are important in the citrus hlb response network, including carbohydrate metabolic process, nitrogen and amino acid metabolic process, transport, defense response, signaling and hormone response. furthermore, our results have led us to propose that transport is a key component in the hlb response core subnetwork. this systems view of citrus response to the ca. liberibacter spp. infection will be a critical first step towards dissecting the genetic mechanisms of hlb response and ultimately improving hlb resistance in citrus.
