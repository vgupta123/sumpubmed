BACKGROUND
chronic neuropathic pain is a refractory pain characterized by its complex mechanisms and diverse clinical manifestations  <cit> . traditional therapies usually bring about many side effects  <cit> . moderate cold stimuli can relieve pain  <cit> , which provides an inspiration for developing new treatments of chronic pain. recently, transient receptor potential  channel family has been proposed to play an important role in thermosensation in mammals. six thermosensitive ion channels of this family have been discovered, including trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpm <dig> and trpa <dig>  among them, trpm <dig> and trpa <dig> are responsive to cold stimuli  <cit> . trpm <dig> is a ligand-gated non-selective cation channel involved in detection of sensations such as coolness. it is permeable to monovalent cations sodium, potassium, and cesium and divalent cation calcium. trpm <dig> is activated by cooling and exogenous chemicals such as menthol and icilin, with an activation temperature of approximate 25-28°c  <cit> . in contrast, trpa <dig> is activated at about 17°c  <cit> . this channel is not required for the transduction of cold sensation in physiological conditions  <cit> , but it is involved in mediating cold hypersensitivity after inflammatory injury  <cit> . all these findings greatly promote the progress in exploring the relationship between temperature and pain. studies have shown that levels of trpm <dig> protein  <cit>  and rna  <cit>  were both increased in rats with chronic neuropathic pain. in addition, inflammatory factors such as h+, bradykinin and phospholipase  <cit> , and altering intracellular ph  <cit>  can both affect the activation of trpm <dig>  these suggested that trpm <dig> ion channel may be closely related to hyperalgesia induced by neurological diseases and inflammation.

in previous studies, much attention has been focused on the role of trpm <dig> in the formation of cold hyperalgesia caused by nerve injury. for example, trpm <dig> was proposed to induce increased sensitivity to cold in mice with chronic neuropathic pain  <cit> . however, some investigators suspected this point of view and put forward that compared with trpm <dig>  trpa <dig> was more likely to play a substantial role in the mechanism of chronic nerve injury-induced cold hyperalgesia  <cit> . in contrast, another study suggested that neither trpm <dig> nor trpa <dig> was likely to contribute directly to cold hyperalgesia in rats with nerve injury  <cit> . so far, there are few studies exploring whether or not trpm <dig> plays a similar role in mechanical allodynia, cold and thermal hyperalgesia, which are most commonly seen clinically that develop after nerve injury. in this study, we simultaneously test the alteration of cold, mechanical and thermal sensitivity in chronic constriction injury  model of neuropathic pain in rats, which facilitates the comparative study of the role of trpm <dig> in the mechanism of these three different types of sensitized pain responses.

in the present study, we firstly demonstrate the variation trend of trpm <dig> protein expression in l <dig> dorsal root ganglia  ipsilateral to nerve injury with the development and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity of the operated hindpaw of cci rats. thereafter how activation or inhibition of trpm <dig> channel influences the behavioral sensitization of cci rats and the expression of trpm <dig> protein in drg is investigated.

RESULTS
alteration of trpm <dig> protein expression following cci
this part of the experiment is used to investigate whether the alteration in trpm <dig> level is related to the mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain. we firstly explore the behavioral performance of hyperalgesia after cci. cold and thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were measured before operation  and on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th and 14th day after operation.

cold hyperalgesia was measured using the cold plate test. compared with the total number of brisk lifts of operated hind paw in sham-operated rats, the value for brisk lifts of cci rats was significantly increased on day  <dig> postligature placement  . this difference reflected a heightened sensitivity to cold stimuli. the increased number of brisk lifts persisted through day  <dig> , and reached the peak on day  <dig> , and remained increased on day  <dig> following ligation . thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by hot plate test. time course of cci-induced thermal hyperalgesia  was the same as that of cci-induced cold hyperalgesia. value for heat-evoked paw withdrawal latency  of cci rats began to decrease on day  <dig> , and reached a minimum on day  <dig>  post-surgery. mechanical allodynia was assessed by von frey filament assay. time course of mechanical sensitivity  following sciatic nerve ligation was also consistent with that of cci-induced cold sensitivity, except that paw withdrawal threshold  reached a minimum on day  <dig>  following ligature placement. it can be seen that cold and thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia began on day  <dig> following cci and maintained at the peak from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after ligature placement.

injury-induced alteration in trpm <dig> level in sensory neurons could underlie the development of behavioral sensitivity. therefore, we examined the alteration of gross expression of trpm <dig> protein in ipsilateral l <dig> drg before operation  and on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th and 14th day after operation using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. level of trpm <dig> protein was expressed as the percentage of trpm <dig> positive neurons relative to total counted drg neurons in immunohistochemistry or the ratio of density of trpm <dig> band to that of β-actin band in western blotting. drg sections displayed positive staining for trpm <dig> mainly in the small-sized neurons, and the distribution of trpm <dig> positive neurons was not changed after cci. percentages of trpm <dig> positive neurons of cci rats were significantly increased relative to values at corresponding time points of sham-operated rats on day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  postligature placement . in immunoblotting, trpm <dig> antibody labeled a dense band at approximately  <dig> kda, which was consistent with the molecular weight of trpm <dig> protein. and β-actin protein, as a control, ran at about  <dig> kda. analytic result of immunoblotting was similar to that of immunohistochemistry. trpm <dig> level of cci rats was first significantly increased on day  <dig> after surgery  compared to that of sham-operated rats, and reached the peak on day  <dig>  and remained significantly elevated on day  <dig> after operation  .

this part of study revealed that trpm <dig> protein expression in l <dig> drg ipsilateral to nerve injury was increased from the 4th to 14th day after cci. this upregulation corresponded well with the development and maintenance of nerve injury-induced hyperalgesia of operated hind paw. these findings imply that the upregulation of trpm <dig> protein may be involved in the mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain.

effect of menthol on hyperalgesic response and the expression of trpm <dig> protein of cci rats
we have found that the increased expression of trpm <dig> protein was related to the hyperalgesia induced by cci. in order to further elucidate the role of trpm <dig> channel in the mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain, we infused menthol, the activator of trpm <dig>  into the subarachnoid space of cci rats to investigate the effect of trpm <dig> activation on development of hyperalgesia following nerve injury. menthol or its control, normal saline, was infused into cci or sham-operated rats through intrathecal catheter on the 14th day after the establishment of pain model, when cci rats were at peak levels of behavioral sensitization.

we observed that application of menthol to cci rats significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. pwt was increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g , and pwl from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s . but menthol also resulted in an increase of the number of brisk lifts from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which implied the enhanced cold sensitivity of cci rats. infusion of normal saline to cci or sham-operated rats, and application of menthol to sham-operated rats all did not produce behavioral changes .

menthol could greatly change the behavioral sensitization of cci rats, and next, we tried to ascertain whether the influence of menthol on neuropathic reflex sensitization was relevant to the alteration in trpm <dig> level. we found that expression levels of trpm <dig> protein in cci rats receiving menthol and cci rats receiving normal saline were obviously higher than those in sham-operated rats receiving menthol and sham-operated rats receiving normal saline . however, there were no statistical significances in the percentage of trpm <dig> positive neurons  and the ratio of density of trpm <dig> band to that of β-actin band  between menthol-treated cci rats  and normal saline-treated cci rats . this suggested that although intrathecal administration of menthol to cci rats significantly influenced the hyperalgesic response, it did not affect the total expression of trpm <dig> protein in ipsilateral l <dig> drg of cci rats. percentage of trpm <dig> positive neurons did not differ in sham-operated rats infused with menthol or with normal saline , implying that menthol also did not influence the expression of trpm <dig> protein in sham-operated rats.

effect of trpm <dig> gene knockdown on hyperalgesic response of cci rats
our study suggested that trpm <dig> expression was upregulated after peripheral nerve injury. and we have also investigated the effect of trpm <dig> activation on cci rats. next, whether selective knockdown of trpm <dig> expression affected behavioral reflex sensitization of cci rats was examined. here, trpm <dig> antisense oligonucleotide  was injected intrathecally to knockdown trpm <dig> protein, and mismatch oligonucleotide  was used as the control of asodn.

we found that number of brisk lifts of asodn-treated cci rats was obviously lower  than that of mmodn-treated cci rats , indicating the application of asodn alleviated cold hyperalgesia of rats with chronic neuropathic pain. but neither pwt  nor pwl  was different between these two groups. there were no statistical differences in value for brisk lifts , pwt  and pwl  between sham-operated rats receiving asodn and those receiving mmodn.

we showed that the percentage of trpm <dig> positive neurons  and the ratio of density of trpm <dig> band to that of β-actin band  in mmodn-treated cci rats were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively. in contrast, values of asodn-treated cci rats were significantly lower . level of trpm <dig> protein in sham-operated rats receiving asodn was also obviously lower than that in sham-operated rats receiving mmodn . interestingly, there was no statistical significance in the level of trpm <dig> protein between asodn-treated cci rats  and asodn-treated sham-operated rats  . in order to examine the specificity of trpm <dig> antisense reagent used in our study, we compared the level of trpv <dig> protein using immunoblotting in l <dig> drg from naïve rats with that from rats intrathecally treated with trpm <dig> asodn during the prior  <dig> consecutive days. we found that trpv <dig> immunoreactivity, at approximately  <dig> kda, did not differ between these two kinds of rats, which was informative to confirm the specificity of trpm <dig> asodn in targeting trpm <dig> .

we can see that downregulation of trpm <dig> protein induced by asodn can attenuate cold hyperalgesia of cci rats, but it had no effect on nerve injury-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity.

discussion
the present study investigated the role of cold receptor trpm <dig> in primary afferent neurons in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain. firstly, we studied the development of sensitized pain behaviors and alteration of trpm <dig> expression after cci to illuminate whether trpm <dig> might participate in the mechanism of nerve injury-induced reflex sensitization. then we observed the effect of trpm <dig> activation or down regulation of trpm <dig> expression on the nociceptive thresholds of cci rats by intrathecal administration of menthol or trpm <dig> asodn.

upregulation on trpm <dig> protein in ipsilateral l <dig> drg correlates with pain hypersensitivity following cci
immunofluorescence revealed that trpm8-immunoreactive neurons were significantly increased in ipsilateral l <dig> drg of cci rats  <cit> . another study using ribonuclease protection assay showed that cci induced an increase of trpm <dig> rna in drg ipsilateral to nerve injury  <cit> . however, the level of trpm <dig> mrna was decreased in spared nerve injury animals  <cit> . in our study, we observed the upregulation of trpm <dig> protein after cci. here, the increase in level of trpm <dig> protein was first evident on the 4th day after cci, and the level reached the peak on the 10th day, and remained significantly elevated on the 14th day postligature placement, concurrent with time course of hyperalgesic response of cci rats that the decrease of nociceptive thresholds began on day  <dig> following cci and persisted up to day  <dig> post-surgery. it can be seen that the upregulaion of trpm <dig> expression in drg is associated with the mechanism of behavioral sensitization induced by nerve injury.

activation of trpm <dig> attenuates mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, but also enhances cold hypersensitivity
menthol at dose of  <dig> μg/kg was applied intrathecally in our study, the dose of which was determined according to the result of our preliminary experiment. in one previous study, menthol of  <dig> μg/kg~ <dig> μg/kg was used to activate trpm <dig> receptor  <cit> . therefore, menthol of  <dig> μg/kg was used as the initial dose in our preliminary experiment. we gradually reduced the amount of menthol and found that the hyperalgesic response of cci rats was also obviously affected even if the dose of menthol was reduced to  <dig> μg/kg. because the purpose of our study was to perform qualitative evaluation of the effect of trpm <dig> activation on cci rats, rather than explore the optimal dose of menthol in activating trpm <dig>  we decided to use menthol of  <dig> μg/kg in our study in order to facilitate the calculation of the dose of menthol.

our study demonstrated that intrathecal application of menthol to cci rats significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, which reflected that activation of trpm <dig> receptor in the spinal cord inhibited nerve injury-induced behavioral sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli. previous study reported that activation of peripheral trpm <dig> receptor induced by topical application of icilin, another trpm <dig> agonist, to the paws ipsilateral to nerve injury also produced robust reversal of cci-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia  <cit> . the mechanism by which the activation of trpm8-mediated signal transduction pathway inhibited neuropathic sensitization may involve group ii and group iii metabotropic glutamate receptors . under physiological conditions, synaptic knobs on axons of nociceptive neurons connect with dorsal horn neurons to form synapses, through which the nociceptive information is transmitted. activation of cool sensory neurons expressing trpm <dig> produces synaptic release of glutamate. then glutamate acts through inhibitory group ii/iii mglurs located either presynaptically on nociceptive neurons or postsynaptically on dorsal-horn neurons, and finally inhibits the input of nociceptive information  <cit> .

in colburn's study, homozygous trpm8-deficient  mice were generated using the method of homologous recombination, whose physiological properties such as span and behavioral characteristics were not different from those of wild type  mice. trpm <dig> mrna and protein levels could not be detected in sensory neurons of trpm8-/- mice. prior to cci, application of acetone to hindpaw of trpm8+/+ mice caused paw lifting, but acetone could not result in behavioral changes in trpm8-/- mice. following sciatic ligation, trpm8+/+ mice exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to acetone. however, acetone sensitivity of trpm8-/- mice was not increased at any time after cci  <cit> . besides, caspani et al  <cit>  observed the activation of trpm <dig> by topical application of menthol to the ipsilateral hind paw of cci mice resulted in the enhancement of hypersensitivity to cold. in our study, cold sensitivity of cci rats was significantly enhanced after intrathecal administration of menthol. these two studies and ours draw a similar conclusion that trpm <dig> may play a crucial role in mediating cold-induced pain after nerve injury. however, caspani et al  <cit>  also reported that the expression of trpm <dig> mrna in drg of cci mice was significantly downregulated. thus they pointed out that cold hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain states was not dependent on increased expression of trpm <dig> in drg. in contrast, in our experiments, after cci and sham-operated rats were both intrathecally treated with menthol, cold sensitivity of cci rats was obviously higher than that of sham-operated rats, and the level of trpm <dig> protein in ipsilateral l <dig> drg of cci rats receiving menthol was also significantly higher than that of sham-operated rats receiving menthol, which implies that enhanced cold hypersensitivity after chronic nerve injury may rely on the increased expression of trpm <dig> protein in drg. we consider that the discrepancies in usage method of menthol, topical in theirs and intrathecal in ours, and the research level of molecule, mrna in theirs and protein in ours, may contribute to the different conclusions about the role of trpm <dig> in the formation of neuropathic cold hyperalgesia.

the mechanism of menthol-induced increased cold hyperalgesia in rats with chronic neuropathic pain may be that menthol can lower the voltage required for the activation of trpm <dig> channel, which is a voltage sensitive channel activated by membrane depolarization, thereby leading to the enhanced cold sensitivity  <cit> .

decreased expression of trpm <dig> protein inhibits reflex sensitization to cold after cci
in the present study, we explored the role of trpm <dig> in cci-induced cold hypersensitivity by reducing the expression of trpm <dig> protein. other researchers also investigated the effect of downregulation of trpm <dig> expression on cold hyperalgesia of cci rats. proudfoot et al  <cit>  found that the development of cci-induced cold hyperalgesia was unaffected although trpm <dig> protein expression was greatly reduced by trpm <dig> asodn. this discovery is opposite to ours. the reason may be the relatively smaller knockdown amplitude of trpm <dig> protein in their study  compared with that in our study  after intrathecal asodn. we intrathecally injected trpm <dig> antisense reagent into cci rats twice a day for  <dig> consecutive days. but in proudfoot's research, trpm <dig> asodn was insistently delivered intrathecally over  <dig> days using minipump containing oligonucleotides which was connected to intrathecal catheter. although the dose of trpm <dig> asodn used for each rat in proudfoot's study  is very similar to the dose used in our research , the difference in infusion mode may influence the knockout effect of antisense reagent on trpm <dig> protein, and finally leads to two different conclusions.

a comparative study of role in the mechanism of nerve injury-induced cold allodynia between trpm <dig> and trpa <dig> was also carried out  <cit> . it was demonstrated that trpa <dig> mrna expression was increased in the nearby uninjured l <dig> drg from the 1st to 14th day after l <dig> spinal nerve ligation , contemporaneous with the development of l <dig> snl-induced neuropathic cold hyperalgesia of the ipsilateral hind paw. however, the expressions of trpm <dig> mrna and protein in the l <dig> drg were not changed within the  <dig> days' trial period. moreover, l <dig> snl-induced cold hyperalgesia was inhibited by intrathecal trpa <dig>  but not trpm <dig> asodn. therefore, this study proposed that the increased trpa <dig> in uninjured l <dig> drg neurons was likely to play a substantial role in the mechanism of cold hyperalgesia in neuropathic states. this point of view is inconsistent with ours that knockdown of the trpm <dig> gene by asodn targeting trpm <dig> attenuated nerve injury-induced cold hyperalgesia. discrepancies in neuropathic pain model and the level of trpm <dig> expression may be the reasons for this inconsistence. intrathecal application of trpm <dig> asodn to snl rats only lowered the level of trpm <dig> protein by 25%  <cit> . the relatively small decrease in trpm <dig> expression is not sufficient to significantly reduce trpm8-mediated exaggerated sensitivity to cold.

a noteworthy question is it seems to be a paradox that intrathecal injection of menthol into cci rats not only suppressed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but also enhanced cold hyperalgesia. that is to say, the inhibitory effect of trpm <dig> activation on mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia was achieved at the expense of increased cold sensitivity. we must emphasize that the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of trpm <dig> channel in the mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain, and explore whether trpm <dig> may be a novel potential target gene for therapy of chronic pain. the result of our animal experiment has proved that some treatments targeting trpm <dig> can really relieve chronic pain, suggesting that it is worthwhile to further explore the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain in terms of cold receptor. the next step is to seek ways to make full use of trpm8-mediated analgesia and minimize even abolish cold hyperalgesia induced by the activation of trpm <dig> channel, such as exploring the most appropriate degree of trpm <dig> activation or reducing trpm8-mediated enhanced cold sensitivity by intervening with other targets except trpm <dig> channel.

CONCLUSIONS
to those who are suffering from chronic pain, cold stimuli of different degree can bring entirely different perceptions. however, in the process of achieving trpm8-mediated analgesic effect, it is still not very clear that trpm <dig> receptor should be activated or inhibited, and this is also the focus of the present study. our results show that upregulation of trpm <dig> protein corresponds well with the induction and maintenance of sensitized pain responses of ipsilateral hind paw caused by nerve injury. activation of trpm <dig> channel reverses the reflex sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli, whereas it enhances cold hyperalgesia as well. on the other hand, downregulation of trpm <dig> protein results in the inhibition of cold hypersensitivity, but it makes no impact on nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. we can see that the function of trpm <dig> in the mechanism of hyperalgesic response after nerve injury is extremely crucial and complex. activating trpm <dig> alone will not produce satisfactory analgesia, neither will inhibiting this channel alone. so, in future studies, we will attempt to find ways to avoid hypersensitivity to cold stimuli induced by trpm <dig> activation while utilizing trpm8-mediated analgesia, which should lead to a deeper understanding of the role of trpm <dig> in pain, and ultimately produce more effective treatments for chronic neuropathic pain.
