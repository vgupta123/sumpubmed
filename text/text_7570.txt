BACKGROUND
fatty acid translocase  is a cell-surface glycoprotein that functions as a multiligand receptor/transporter involved in various diverse physiological processes and disorders, including atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes . in peripheral tissues active in fatty acid metabolism, such as muscle and adipose tissues, cd <dig> facilitates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids  across the plasma membrane. a null mutation of cd <dig> reduces fatty acid  uptake rates and metabolism in these tissues  <cit> , while its over-expression results in the opposing effects  <cit> . although cd36-deficient mice display reduced triacylglycerol  in muscle, lipid accumulation is increased in the liver. the latter is probably due to increased plasma fa concentrations and cd36-independent hepatic fa uptake. as a consequence of these effects, insulin sensitivity is enhanced peripherally, while it appears impaired in the liver  <cit> . since muscle and adipose tissues shift to high glucose utilization in cd36-deficiency, hypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia develop in the fasted state in cd36-deficient mice  <cit> . also, over-expression of cd <dig> in muscle tissues is associated with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, as a result of enhanced fa utilisation and glucose sparing. taken together, expression-levels of cd <dig> affect lipid and glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity in different tissues. abnormal regulation of cd <dig> expression might therefore contribute to the onset or severity of several metabolic diseases.

cd <dig> abundance is regulated at different levels, including gene expression, mrna stability and protein expression in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. different physiological conditions, where the nutritional and/or hormonal status of the individual is affected, have been shown to impact on cd <dig> levels in the plasma membrane. regulation at the level of mrna expression in skeletal muscle has been reported to include starvation, refeeding  <cit>  and exercise  <cit> , but only a few studies report the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. although pparα, pparγ  <cit> , pxr  <cit> , nr4a   <cit>  and foxa <dig>   <cit>  have been shown to affect cd <dig> expression, no direct interaction of these transcription factors in the cd <dig> promoter have been described. furthermore, recent analyses of the cd <dig> gene has revealed a complicated promoter structure with alternative transcription start sites  <cit> . alternative promoter usage has been shown to contribute to tissue-specific regulation of cd <dig> expression in both mice and humans  <cit> . although the alternative promoters are mapped in the human and murine cd <dig> genes, less information is available for the rat gene.

hepatic cd <dig> has not been considered physiologically important, due to low level of expression in the liver and the fact that hepatic lipid uptake is independent of cd <dig>  perhaps as a consequence of this, little is known about hepatic cd <dig> gene regulation. however, we have recently shown that cd <dig> expression is female-predominant in rat liver  <cit> . it was also shown that the female pattern of growth hormone  secretion induces cd <dig> mrna levels in male liver, suggesting that there might be conditions where increased or decreased activities of hepatic cd <dig> is needed and that these conditions might be slightly different in male and female livers. the aim with the present study was to extend our knowledge about regulatory mechanisms behind hepatic cd <dig> expression. since alternative cd <dig> transcripts have been described in mouse and human tissues, we investigated whether alternative transcription start sites might be involved in differentially regulating cd <dig> mrna abundance in rat liver in different hormonal and nutritional states.

RESULTS
comparison between mouse and rat cd <dig> gene structures
the mouse cd <dig> gene has at least three characterized untranslated first exons and corresponding promoters, resulting in three major alternative transcripts  <cit> . similarly, the human cd <dig> gene can be expressed from five alternative first exons  <cit> . when the first exon of rat cd <dig>  is mapped to the genome browser it is equivalent to exon  <dig> in the human and mouse genes. gene structures and exon distances are otherwise similar between mouse and rat. since the rat genomic sequence is incomplete upstream of exon  <dig> , we looked for rat exon 1a and 1b in the ucsc genome database. a few ests showed high sequence homology to corresponding mouse exon 1b. however, the estimated location of rat exon 1a fell within regions where sequence information is unavailable.

to determine whether the rat cd <dig> 5'-untranslated region  is similar to that of the mouse, primers were designed from the common sequences between mouse and rat; for exon 1a according to   and  , and for exon 1b according to   and  . pcr products derived from male or female rat hepatic cdna, corresponding to regions from either exon 1a to exon  <dig>  or from exon 1b to exon  <dig> , were generated and sequenced. the amplified products appeared as single bands, as examined by gel electrophoresis, with the corresponding estimated sizes of  <dig> bp for 1a- <dig> and  <dig> bp for 1b- <dig>  upon sequencing, it was apparent that these products had different first exon sequences but identical exon  <dig> and  <dig> sequences . this finding suggests that the use of exon 1a and exon 1b is mutually exclusive in rat liver . furthermore, high similarity scores between mouse and rat exon 1a- <dig>  and 1b- <dig>  sequences, suggest that the sequenced pcr products originating from rat liver are homologous to the corresponding mouse cd <dig> transcripts. aligning human and rodent exon 1a and 1b sequences revealed low similarities.

since sequence information for rat cd <dig> exon 1a and its promoter is limited, this promoter was cloned from rat liver dna. primers were designed corresponding to highly conserved genomic regions within the human and mouse exon 1a promoter. the amplified product was estimated to be  <dig> bp long with a sequence similar to that of the mouse 1a promoter region, as described by sato et al.  <cit> . this sequence  was also identical to part of a cloned rat cd <dig> promoter , not mapped in genome databases . alignment of these rodent promoter sequences and the human exon 1a promoter revealed 70% similarity in the region of - <dig> bp, whereas the corresponding promoter regions of exon 1b were slightly less similar  . this suggests that the regulatory function of these promoters might be evolutionarily conserved.

tissue-specific expression patterns of alternative first exons of cd <dig> have been described in mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit> , suggesting that the alternative first exons of the gene are regulated individually. according to sato et al., exon 1a is more expressed in liver than muscle, whereas the opposite is shown for exon 1b  <cit> . comparing expression levels in human tissues active in fa metabolism, exon 1a is highest expressed in adipose tissue, followed by heart, skeletal muscle and liver, with a ratio of approximately  <dig> between adipose tissue and liver  <cit> . exon 1b showed the same relative expression levels, but only  <dig> fold differences between fat and liver  <cit> . whether males and females have different tissue-specific patterns of alternative first exons was not investigated in the studies referred to.

sex different expression of cd <dig> transcripts in mouse and rat liver
we next wanted to determine a possible role for alternative promoter usage in the previously described sex-different expression of cd <dig> in rat liver. expression levels of exon 1a and 1b were thus analyzed in male and female livers from rats and mice by real-time pcr and compared to exon 3– <dig>  representing the protein coding region. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the exon 1a- <dig> transcript was significantly higher expressed in females as compared to males, in both species. although similar results were obtained for exon 1b- <dig> and the coding region , the sex-difference was most pronounced for exon 1a- <dig>  a species difference in the degree of sex-dependence was observed for all transcripts measured, with larger differences in rats. compared to males, female rats had  <dig>  times higher expression of the exon 3– <dig> transcript in liver, whereas the difference was only  <dig>  times in mice. similarly, female rats had 6-fold higher levels of exon 1a- <dig> compared to males. in the mouse, female expression was only  <dig> -fold higher compared to males.

hormonal regulation of hepatic cd <dig> expression
many hepatic sex-differences in gene expression can be explained by sex-different levels of different hormones. male rats exposed to estrogen display a "feminized" pattern of hepatic gene expression  <cit> . gh also exerts feminizing effects, but only if delivered in a continuous fashion that mimics the endogenous female secretory pattern of gh . a male pattern of hepatic gene expression can instead be induced by intermittent administration of gh   <cit> . this can be explained by the fact that plasma gh profiles are sexually dimorphic in rodents. male rats secrete gh in an episodic rhythm in which interpulse periods contain no detectable levels of the hormone. gh secretion in the female rat is also pulsatile, but can be characterized as "continuous" since hormone levels are always present in the circulation. old age, which is associated with reduced pulse amplitude but unchanged trough gh values in male rats, has also been shown to "feminize" hepatic gene expression  <cit> . in mice, although the pulse frequencies are greater in females, gh levels in peaks and interpeaks are the same between males and females  <cit> . this might explain why some sex-dependent and gh regulated genes  are more sex-differentiated in rats as compared to mice.

in attempts to find putative hormonal factors behind the female-predominant expression of cd <dig> in rat liver, the hormonal states described above were investigated regarding hepatic cd <dig> mrna expression. expression levels of exons 1a- <dig>  1b- <dig>  and 3– <dig> were compared between "feminized" and untreated  adult males. as demonstrated in figure 4a, all transcripts were significantly increased in "feminized" males, except for exon 1b- <dig> in 17α-ethinylestradiol  treated males. the feminizing effect was highest for exon 1a- <dig>  suggesting that that ee and ghc treatment might induce cd <dig> expression preferentially through the exon 1a promoter whereas the changes associated with old age might have another mechanism of action.

when old male rats were treated by episodic administration of gh , which mimics the endogenous secretory pattern of gh in young adult male rats, cd <dig> gene expression was repressed and restored to the same level as in young adult males . however, exon specific repression by ghi treatment was not observed. this is in line with the finding that old age induced exons 1a- <dig>  1b- <dig>  and 3– <dig> to similar extent . this suggests that the low level of cd <dig> expression in  male rats might be due to the pulsatile secretion of gh in males. when this pattern of gh secretion becomes less pulsatile  as the male rats get older, this inhibition is released and cd <dig> mrna levels increase. we speculate that regulatory dna sequences mediating the inhibitory action of pulsatile gh are present in both exon 1a and 1b promoters, whereas those important for the stimulatory effect of continuous gh are specific for exon 1a.

since our studies were performed on whole animals it is impossible to determine whether the hormonal effects on cd <dig> expression are due to direct effects on the liver or through secondary changes. the dose of ee used in this study has been shown to "feminize" the male rat liver  <cit> . the relatively weak effect of this treatment might be due to an indirect action on the liver, with estrogen acting on the pituitary by altering the pattern of gh secretion. estrogen treatment of male rats is known to "feminize" the secretory pattern of gh into a more continuous mode  <cit> . however, the greater effect obtained by ghc treatment compared to estrogen, could also be explained by other indirect effects of gh treatment. gh is for instance well-known to stimulate adipose lipolysis, leading to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids  <cit> , which might reprogram hepatic gene expression through various lipid-modulated transcription factors.

nutritional regulation of cd <dig> expression
the nutritional status of the individual has been shown to affect cd <dig> expression in skeletal muscle, including starvation-mediated up-regulation  <cit> . both starvation and increased secretion of gh will lead to activation of lipolysis in the adipose tissue, increased levels of circulating fatty acids, as well as increased expression of cd <dig> in muscle  or liver . to determine whether the level of cd <dig> expression and thus ability to import lcfa is coordinated between muscle and liver, we compared these tissues regarding the different cd <dig> transcripts in animals deprived of food for either  <dig> or  <dig> hours. animals that have been without food for  <dig> hours  should have an increased lipolysis in comparison to  <dig> hours. as demonstrated in figure 5a,  <dig> h of food deprivation led to significantly reduced cd <dig> mrna expression in livers from females, without any differences in alternative exon  <dig> transcripts. no effect was observed in male rats. as a consequence, the sex difference in cd <dig> expression was greatly reduced in the fasted rats. in contrast, the expression of cd <dig> in skeletal muscle was increased in both males and females . this stimulatory effect of food withdrawal was highest for exon 1a- <dig>  suggesting that fasting might induce cd <dig> expression preferentially through the exon 1a promoter. these observations confirms previous reports on cd <dig> regulation in skeletal muscle  <cit> , and shows that cd <dig> expression is differently regulated in muscle and liver. as demonstrated in figure 5c, the starvation-mediated down-regulation of cd <dig> in female livers could also be observed at the protein level, indicating that animals in this nutritional state might prioritize muscular uptake of lcfa at the expense of hepatic.

in silico promoter analysis of the rat cd <dig> promoter
as described above, the gene structure of cd <dig> in rat is similar to that described in mouse, with at least two alternative first exons . we observe a female-predominant expression of the transcripts starting with both exon 1a and exon 1b, but the sex-specific expression difference is greater for the transcripts starting with exon 1a. the exon 1a-specific up-regulation of cd <dig> is even more pronounced after ghc-induction in male rat liver. the effects of old age and starvation in liver, on the other hand, appeared to be independent of alternative first exon usage. we therefore wanted to identify putative transcription factor binding sites  within the exon 1a and 1b promoters which might be able to explain the observed differences and similarities regarding first exon usage in rat liver.

we used the match™ program, in which position specific weight matrix  models are used to predict tfbs, and the consite program to identify evolutionary conserved sequences between rat, mouse and human in the upstream regions of the alternative first exons of cd <dig>  the sequences from - <dig> to + <dig> base pairs relative to the transcription start sites of the two exons were found to be highly conserved between species , so we focused the in silico analysis on these regions. pwm models of tfbs have been shown to predict sites that are functional in vitro  <cit>  but it is also well known that the method results in a high number of predictions that are non-functional in vivo  <cit> . in order to make as relevant predictions as possible, we limited our analysis to available pwms for transcription factors known to be expressed in the liver  and transcription factors that are known from the literature to be sex-dependent or controlled by gh . predicted binding sites for the available transcription factors are shown in figures 6a  and 6b . most of the putative tfbs were conserved between rat and mouse and some could also be predicted in the human promoters. please refer to additional files for sequences, positions and other information related to these putative tfbs. some tfbs were found to be common between the two promoters, such as those for hnf3β, whereas others were promoter-specific. the two putative binding sites for hnf3β were both found to be conserved between rat and mouse and might be of special interest since constitutively active hnf3β was previously shown to increase hepatic cd <dig> expression  <cit> . furthermore, the level of hnf3β in rat liver has been shown to be gh-dependent  <cit>  and to induce the expression of the female-specific cyp2c <dig> transcript in rat liver  <cit> . needless to say, this does not imply that cd <dig> expression is regulated in the same manner as cyp2c <dig> 

since exon 1a containing transcripts were shown to increase more in response to ghc, there might be inhibitory factors operating within the exon 1b promoter. stat5b is a candidate repressor as it is activated in male rat liver in direct response to each incoming plasma gh pulse and is partially down-regulated by a continuous, female-like pattern of gh-stimulation  <cit> . stat5b has been proposed to collaborate with the hnfs to regulate the sex-dependent hepatic expression of cyp-genes  <cit> . no putative stat5b binding sites were however revealed within either promoter. binding sites for the male-specific transcription factors sry  and sox <dig>  were identified within the exon 1b promoter. overexpression of the sry-like protein ire-abp  has been shown to inhibit the stimulatory effect of c/ebpα on cyp2c <dig> expression in primary hepatocytes  <cit> . purely speculative, similar mechanism might operate within the exon 1b promoter, which could explain the differences in the amount of up-regulation of exon 1a and exon 1b in ghc treated male rats.

as mentioned above, pwms have been shown to produce a lot of false positive binding site predictions. potential sites must therefore be validated experimentally before any conclusions can be drawn about which transcription factors mediate the up- or down-regulation of the alternative first exons of cd <dig> observed in this study. nevertheless, these predictions are based on the currently available tools for in silico predictions of regulatory elements, and can be considered a first guess and a guide to which sites to prioritize for further in vitro and in vivo studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to improve our knowledge about regulatory mechanisms behind hepatic cd <dig> expression. we have extended the sequence information of the rat cd <dig> 5'-utr and shown that the gene structure of cd <dig> in rat is similar to that described in mouse, which contains at least two alternative first exons . the rat cd <dig> exon 1a promoter was sequenced and shown to be highly similar to human and murine cd <dig>  a greater sex-specific expression difference was observed for the transcripts starting with exon 1a in rat liver. furthermore, estrogen or ghc treatment of male rats induced cd <dig> expression preferentially through the exon 1a promoter. old age was also associated with increased cd <dig> expression in male rats, albeit without any preferential first exon usage. ghi treatment in old male rats reversed  this effect. similarly, the two different exon  <dig> containing transcripts were equally well reduced in response to starvation in female rats. the results obtained in this study confirm and extend our previous observation that gh is an important regulator of hepatic cd <dig>  and depending on the mode of treatment  the gene might be either induced or repressed. we therefore suggest that the effects of continuous gh secretion in females  and intermittent gh secretion in males  explains the sex-different expression of this gene.
