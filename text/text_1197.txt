BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are mobile genetic element able to transpose and multiply in genomes. a unified te classification with further subdivisions into subclasses, orders and families has been proposed  <cit> . the two major subdivisions are class i  and class ii , which differ according to their mechanism of transposition. massive te expansions play a significant role in genome structure, dynamics and evolution  <cit> . they shape the genomic landscape by providing novel dna sequences at various locations, by contributing to chromosomal rearrangements, gene duplications, gene loss and inactivation and by accelerating evolution. thus, tes play an important role in adaptation and speciation  <cit> . in fungi, they have been shown to accelerate the evolution of genes that affect pathogenicity and host range  <cit> . the ability of tes to invade genomes is frequently counterbalanced by defense mechanisms that restrain their expression and mobility  <cit> . three defense mechanisms against tes are known in fungi  <cit> . repeat-induced point mutation  occurs at a premeiotic stage during sexual reproduction. this defense mechanism detects dna sequence duplications and induces irreversible c:g to t:a mutations at a high rate in these sequences. this fungal-specific defense mechanism was first discovered in n. crassa  <cit>  and then in a few other fungal species  <cit> . rip occurs preferentially at cpa dinucleotide sites in most fungi  <cit> , although other dinucleotide sites including cpg may also be involved  <cit> . rip requires the rid <dig> gene, predicted to encode a c5-dna-methyltransferase  of the dnmt <dig> family  <cit> . dnmt <dig> enzymes methylate cysteine residues at specific dinucleotide sites   <cit> . the high number of c to t mutations associated with rip is thought to occur by rid1-mediated deamination of methylated cytosine, leading to its replacement with thymine  <cit> . orthologs of this gene have been identified in other neurospora species  <cit>  including aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus nidulans  <cit> , fusarium graminearum  <cit> , and leptosphaeria maculans  <cit> . the second defense mechanism, called mip , also occurs during sexual reproduction. it was first discovered in ascobolus immersus and is required for the de novo methylation of cytosine in repeated sequences during meiosis. mip requires masc <dig>  a gene encoding a putative a dnmt <dig> cytosine methyl transferase related to rid <dig>  <cit> . a third defense mechanism, called quelling, was first identified in n. crassa  <cit> . it involves the rna interference machinery  that suppresses te expression  <cit> .

another gene-silencing process, the meiotic silencing by unpaired dna  occurring in meiotic cells has been reported. in n. crassa, unpaired dna causes silencing of all their homologs dna . this process is mediated by putative rna-directed rna polymerase   <cit> .

both rip and mip require a dnmt <dig> cytosine methyl transferase  from the same subfamily  <cit> ; therefore, these processes probably rely on similar molecular mechanisms, such as transient de novo methylation of cytosine residues in repeated sequences during sexual reproduction at specific dinucleotide sites. other known fungal dnmt <dig> mtases are involved in cytosine methylation associated with heterochromatin maintenance such as dim- <dig> in n. crassa  <cit>  and masc <dig> in a. immersus  <cit> , both of which belong to a different dnmt <dig> subfamily than rid1/masc <dig>  <cit> . dnmt <dig> mtases normally methylate at cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . however, dnmt <dig> mtases involved in rip bias may have evolved to recognize dinucleotides other than cpg. in the basidiomycete microbotryum violaceum, c to t mutation bias in tes occurs preferentially at a trinucleotide tpcpg site  <cit> , suggesting the involvement of a dnmt <dig> mtase specific to the cpg di-nucleotide. this mutation bias at cpg di-nucleotide is consistent with the model of mutation via methylation-mediated deamination of 5-methyl cytosine  previously describe in human genetic disease  <cit> . in ascomycetes, rip occurs preferentially at dinucleotide cpa sites  <cit> ; however, in a. niger and a. fumigatus rip may also occur at cpg sites in tes in addition to cpa  <cit> , suggesting the involvement of dnmt <dig> mtases recognizing mainly cpa but also cpg di-nucleotides. however it has also been suggested that the rip-like process based on 5mc methylation followed by deamination may operate in a different manner in basidiomycetes than ascomycetes and that the rid homologue may have diverged during the evolutionary time separating these two phyla  <cit> .

in this study, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of c to t mutation bias in  <dig> fungal genomes with different te content, which were recently analysed using the tedenovo  <cit>  and the teannot  <cit>  from the repet te annotation package in the context of international fungal genome projects. we used the consensus sequences of te families and corresponding te genomic sequences for each genome obtained from the tedenovo and the teannot pipelines, respectively. we performed  a genome-wide comparison of te content;  a ripcal-based  <cit>  exhaustive search of c to t mutations in tes with their associated dinucleotide sites; and  a functional annotation and phylogenetic analysis of genes encoding rid/masc <dig> and dim-2/masc <dig> dnmt <dig> mtases in these  <dig> genomes. the observed dinucleotide patterns at c to t mutation sites in fungal tes suggest that te defense mechanisms have different sequence specificities. our findings also reveal an association between these patterns and the presence of specific dnmt <dig> genes. we propose a scenario for the evolution of dnmt <dig> subfamilies, in which the rid1-dependent rip mechanism emerged in ascomycota after its radiation from basidiomycota.

RESULTS
recent te invasions in fungi explain the lack of correlation between genome size and taxonomy
we used the repet te annotation package to produce a standardized genome-wide annotation of tes from  <dig> fungi  with different lifestyles, including seven ascomycetes , sclerotinia sclerotiorum  <cit> , blumeria graminis fp. hordeï  <cit> , leptosphaeria maculans  <cit> , magnaporthe oryzae  <cit> , tuber melanosporum  <cit> ) and three basidiomycetes . among the  <dig> species studied, bcint <dig>  had the lowest te content , whereas bgra had the highest . sscl, mory and mvio had intermediate te content , close to the average te content in fungi . lmac, tmel, pgra, mlar had high te content . the genomes of fungi with high te content  were larger than those of typical fungi or related species with low te content . the large te content of bgra  substantially affects the size and organization of its genome: the bgra genome is 120 mb, which is 80 mb larger than that of the related species bcin and sscl, contains only 30 mb of coding space, compared to 40 mb in other ascomycetes species, and many of its genes are surrounded by te rich regions. the highly related species blumeria graminis formae speciales tritici also has a genome with high te content  as do other related species from the erysiphales   <cit> . the occurrence of te functional categories greatly differs between species  and is independent of their taxonomic relationship , except for the related rust fungi pgra and mlar  <cit> . for example, tmel, mory and lmac are characterized by a high proportion of ltr retrotransposons , although they are classified in very distantly related taxonomic orders, whereas the main te categories in more related species such as mory and sscl are very different: ltrs make up 10% and 60% of tes in sscl and mory, respectively and tir tes make up 30% and 20% of tes in sscl and mory, respectively . we noted similar differences between highly related species such as bcin and sscl. line and helitron tes were detected in sscl , but not in bcin, whereas the proportion of ltr tes was lower in sscl  than in bcin . the differences in te content and te categories among related species, such as bcint <dig> and bcin <dig>  and sscl and bgra, are presumably due to relatively recent te invasions, as suggested previously  <cit> . for example, differences in the composition of tes between sscl and bcin are due to the recent invasion of a few families of class ii tir dna and line tes in sscl. these subfamilies of sscl tir tes are composed of almost identical copies dispersed in the genome, whereas other subfamilies of sscl tir tes are highly polymorphic  <cit> .table  <dig>

analysis of te g:c content reveals multi-modal distributions
one major consequence of rip involves genome g:c content, because rip increases the a:t content of mutated te copies. as a result, when tes are clustered in large blocks, the rip-mediated mutation of c:g to a:t generates a:t rich isochores, as observed in lmac  <cit> . we sought to identify a:t rich regions associated with tes; therefore, we compared the g:c content of high quality tes  or low quality tes  with the g:c content of the whole genome across  <dig> kb sliding windows denoted as gsw. lmac was the only species of our sample that displayed a bimodal gsw. the peak at 36% g:c corresponds to a:t-rich isochores composed mainly of riped te copies , which have been described previously  <cit> . other genomes displayed a unimodal gsw with a peak around 45-50% g:c, with the exception of mvio  and the negative control atha . the distribution of g:c content in tes frequently differed from that in the gsw. in the negative control atha, the g:c content of tecphq was bimodal. the low tecphq values  probably correspond to heavily mutated ancestral tes that tend to be depleted in c:g sites because they are highly methylated  <cit> . in genomes invaded by tes  the distribution of g:c content was similar between tes  and the whole genome . however, the high te content of these genomes clearly introduces a bias because te content makes up a larger proportion of genomic space than non-te content. in other genomes, the distribution of g:c content between tes and the whole genome was very different, in particular for tecphq. for example, tecphq elements in bcint <dig> had four peaks of gc content; one of these peaks  was very similar to the whole genome  peak, whereas the three other peaks comprised two groups of tes with low g:c content  and one group with high g:c content . mory showed a similar profile consisting of two peaks  surrounding another peak at 50% corresponding to the whole genome gc content. tes peaks with low g:c content in bcint <dig> may correspond to tes copies that have undergone rip-associated c to t mutations at various rates. indeed, the tecphq peak at 20% g:c content in bcint <dig> comprises at-rich te copies that are even more abundant among tecplq elements . these highly degenerated tes may result from multiple rounds of rip leading to the mutation of all their target c:g sites.figure  <dig>

dinucleotide signatures associated with c to t mutation sites in tes differ among fungi and te families
the mutation resulting from rip is a transition . we used multiple sequence alignment  to compare genomic te copies with the consensus te sequence of each family to search for mutational biases and identify rip-associated signatures in fungal tes. if all possible mutations were equally likely, we would expect twice as many transversions  as transitions , given a random mutation ti/tv ratio of  <dig> . we used msas from atha tes  <cit>  as negative controls of rip-associated biases because rip has not been observed in plants. we found that the mean ti/tv ratio of atha te families was equal to  <dig>  . genome-wide analysis of bgra, pgra and mlar tes showed that their average ti/tv ratio was similar to that of atha . tes copies from all other fungal genomes displayed a higher mean ti/tv ratio . we selected te genomic copies with a ti/tv >  <dig> , which is a stringent threshold compared to the atha negative control . using these te sequences, we searched for dinucleotides associated with c to t mutation sites. lmac tes were used as a positive control for a rip-associated signature  <cit> . we first observed that the percentage of te copies with a high ti/tv ratio varied widely from genome to genome . most lmac tes  had a high ti/tv ratio , as reported previously  <cit> . by contrast, the percentage of tes with a ti/tv ratio >  <dig>  was low  and similar to that of the negative control atha  in the three species  massively invaded by tes, suggesting that they are deficient for rip. the remaining species had an intermediate proportion of tes  with a ti/tv ratio >  <dig> . we next searched for dinucleotide signatures at c to t mutation sites in tes with a ti/tv ratio >  <dig> . as expected, we found that the vast majority  of lmac te c to t mutation sites was associated with a cpa dinucleotide . we also found this canonical rip-associated dinucleotide signature in a large fraction  of sscl tes. however, we identified other dinucleotide signatures  at c to t mutation sites in tes from other fungal genomes. in some fungal species, these were the only signatures present in tes, whereas in other species they were found in addition to cpa signatures. in bcint <dig>  bcinb <dig>  sscl, and mory, we identified a large number of tes with a cpt signature  in addition to cpa signatures . in the te-rich tmel genome, many te copies  displayed a ti/tv ratio >  <dig>  the c to t mutation sites of tmel tes displayed predominantly a cpg signature  in addition to a cpa signature . in mvio, a large number of te copies  displayed a ti/tv ratio >  <dig>  the c to t mutation sites of mvio tes displayed only a cpg signature . in genomes with high te content , the number of te copies that displayed only a cpg signature at their c to t mutation site was small .figure  <dig>

dinucleotide signatures at c to t mutation sites in fungal tes are associated with specific dnmt <dig> subfamilies
we next addressed whether the differences in c to t mutation bias in tes and their associated dinucleotide signatures among fungi could be explained by the presence/absence in these various species of different genes involved in this process. rip and mip require cytosine methyltransferases of the dnmt <dig> family; therefore, we searched for  <dig> fungal genomes  for genes encoding dnmt <dig> mtases. forty-four proteins containing the cytosine specific methyltransferase panther domain  were recovered from these  <dig> genomes. this domain overlaps on both ends the c5-cytosine methyltransferase pfam domain , which is specific to the cytosine dna mtase family . phylogenetic analysis of the pthr <dig> domain extracted from the  <dig> dnmt <dig> protein sequences  showed that these proteins clustered into two very distinct clades. the first clade , contains proteins related to rid and masc <dig> whereas the second clade  contains proteins related to dim <dig> and masc <dig>  this second clade is composed of two subclasses , corresponding to proteins related to either masc <dig> or to dim <dig>  respectively. interestingly, all the genomes with cpa or cpt dinucleotide signatures in tes, had at least one gene coding for a protein of the masc1/rid family . all these genomes belong to species of ascomycota . the three genomes that displayed only tes with a cpg dinucleotide signature  contained only one gene coding for a dnmt <dig>  a class iia protein related to masc <dig> . these three organisms belong to the basidiomycota.figure  <dig>

protein domain annotation of the  <dig> dnmt <dig> proteins revealed that the proteins belonging to the classes and subclasses established above  showed extensive synapomorphy in their domain composition . phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic distribution suggest that the c5_mtase_ <dig> c-terminal amino-acid signature  was most likely present in the common ancestor of both classes . by contrast, the bromo-adjacent homology  domain, which is commonly found in chromatin-associated proteins and usually present in a duplicated form  <cit> , and the n-terminal dnmt1-rfd , which is a methyltransferase replication foci domain of the dnmt <dig> protein required for methylation of the correct residue   <cit> , were detected only in class  <dig> dnmt <dig> proteins . several domains were irregularly distributed among fungal dnmt <dig> proteins. for instance, the prosite domain c5_mtase_ <dig> , which is part of the pf <dig> domain , was detected in almost all  dnmt <dig> class iib  proteins, but only in a sub-cluster  of class iia proteins that are highly related to masc <dig>  this domain is absent in almost all  dnmt <dig> class i . by contrast, c5_mtase_ <dig> , a c- <dig> cytosine-specific dna methylase c-terminal amino-acid signature, was found in 50% of the masc1/rid proteins and in class ii proteins, this domain was restricted to the masc2-like class iia subcluster . thorough examination of the organization of the predicted dna mtase domain  in fungal dnmt <dig> homologs revealed that it is on average smaller  in class i proteins than in class ii proteins . this difference is due to a large region upstream from the c-terminal catalytic domain that is present only in the dnmt <dig> class ii proteins. another amino-acid probably lost the gene, the c5mettrfrase  from the prints fingerprint protein database, was present in almost all  dnmt <dig> proteins. nevertheless, it is probable that these three patterns  were probably present in a common ancestor of the two classes because we found relics of these motifs in all  <dig> proteins analyzed . we also used the meme tool to identify conserved motifs in fungal dnmt <dig> proteins. this analysis revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved motifs where specific to either dnmt <dig> class i or class ii proteins: five motifs  were present only in dnmt <dig> class i proteins whereas the other  <dig> motifs were present only in dnmt <dig> class ii proteins . the five motifs specific to dnmt <dig> class i proteins are not part of any known functional domain. among these five motifs specific to rid/masc1-like proteins, one  was only found in bcin, sscl and mory . this domain may be involved in the cpt di-nucleotide signature specific to these three genomes. among the  <dig> motifs only present in dnmt <dig> class ii proteins, three  are specific to class iia . motif  <dig> is located in the bah domain whereas motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are located in the c5-mtase domain. seven other motifs are specific to the class iib  proteins . motif  <dig> is located in the bah domain and motif  <dig> is located in the c5_mtase domain. motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are upstream from the c5-mtase domains, are located around the motif  <dig> that is specific to the dnmt1-rfd domain. this domain is present in most of class iia proteins but only in one class iib protein  . these results show that the evolution of sequences located in or around the dnmt1-rfd and bah domains are compatible with the phylogenetic analysis of the c5-mtase domain.

discussion
recent te invasions of fungal genomes explain the lack of correlation between genome size and taxonomic relationships
we were able to annotate successfully te copies, even when they were small and degenerated. the te consensus sequence provided by the tedenovo detection and classification pipeline was very similar to the ancestral sequence of the te family. the annotations obtained with these consensus libraries provided a quasi-exhaustive set of copies that could be used to search for methylation signatures of repeat-based silencing processes. except for pgra and mlar, which are characterized by similar categories of tes and an almost equivalent te content and distribution of class i and class ii elements, we did not find any correlation between the distribution of tes and taxonomic relationships. the main difference in the composition of tes in the two related fungi botrytis and sclerotinia is due to the lack of line elements in bcin . the difference in their te content  is almost certainly due to a recent invasion of class ii tir elements  <cit> .

the frequency of c to t mutation bias in tes is correlated with genome size and organization
our rip signature analysis in lmac revealed the presence of at-rich genome blocks composed of highly riped copies, thus confirming our previous findings in this species. similar at-rich isochore-like islands were also recently found in repeated regions of the colletotrichum graminicola genome  <cit> . these organisms may be examples of successful te invasions  counter-balanced by an efficient rip silencing mechanism. we also noticed that genomes with a lower te content, such as b. cinerea t <dig> and b <dig> isolates  have many at rich relics of te copies that are probably signatures of ancient rip . we also found an interesting correlation between fungal lifestyles and massive te expansion; the obligate biotrophs bgra, mlar and pgra and the symbiote  tmel had higher te loads than the remaining studied fungi which are all necrotrophs.

dinucleotide mutation signatures at c to t mutation sites in fungal tes are associated with specific dna methyltransferases
in four fungal species , te copies showed mutational biases at two different dinucleotides that could be signatures of two different mechanisms . all four species had a cpa dinucleotide signature, like in n. crassa where the rip was experimentally observed  <cit>  or in l. maculans where it the high level of rip was detected in-silico  <cit> . t. melanosporum had a cpg signature, whereas a cpt signature was found in the three other species. a fifth species, l. maculans exhibited an extensive cpa signature suggestive of a high rate of rip, and showed no other dinucleotide signature. a rid/masc1-like gene was present  only in the five species exhibiting a cpa signature in their te copies, . we did not find any gene of the dnmt <dig> family in b. graminis f. sp. hordei. the absence of genes responsible for repeat silencing probably explains the large expansion of tes in this fungus, as well as in the other formae speciale of wheat, b. graminis triticeae  <cit> . b. graminis lost half of its genes during its evolution towards an obligate biotrophic lifestyle  <cit> . it probably also lost the gene responsible for rip. indeed, we found traces of rip in a very small number of te copies that exhibit the cpa dinucleotide target signature. the rip of these te copies probably predates the loss of the rip gene. three species  showed only a cpg mutation signature in their te copies. in these genomes, we did not find any gene belonging to the dnmt <dig> class i rid/masc1-like phylogenetic group ; instead, we found one gene belonging the dnmt <dig> class iia . this suggests that dnmt <dig> class iia proteins  are involved in a mechanism occurring preferentially at cpg target sites. indeed, the three species m. violaceum, m. larici-populina and p. graminis  of our study exhibited a cpg signature  and possessed a masc2-like gene, but not any other dnmt1-like gene. to date, no published analysis has associated the dinucleotide targets of transition mutations to potential genes and functional domains involved in these mutations.

evolution of dnmt <dig> subgroup proteins
here we showed that a part of the pfam domain pf <dig> specific to dna methyltransferase  is missing from all the rid/masc1-like proteins . in addition, we found four motifs specific to these genes . the loss of part of the c5_mtase domain associated with the acquisition of these four motifs may have resulted in the specialization of the gene responsible for the rip process, the efficiency of which depends on the organism . a fifth motif  only present in b. cinerea, s. sclerotiorum and m. oryzae could be involved in the recognition of the dinucleotide target cpt because this signature was detected only in te copies from these species. the specialization of rid and dim- <dig> probably occurred after the radiation between the basidiomycota and ascomycota phyla. indeed, masc2-like genes  were the only dnmt <dig> genes in basidiomycetes and we found neither rid/masc <dig> nor dim- <dig> genes in this phylum. this suggests that rip does not target cpg dinucleotides. in tmel where was found a cpg signature in addition to cpt it was recently showed that a high fraction of transposons with methylated cytosine had a strong preference for cpg sites  <cit> . in  <dig>  clutterbuck  <cit>  proposed that the mechanism responsible for c to t mutations at cpg target sites in fungi was probably cytosine methylation followed by the deamination of the methyl-cytosines. however a correlation between this process and the genes that are potentially involved has not yet been reported. although we did not find any rid-like gene or dnmt <dig> gene in b. graminis, we found evidence of dinucleotide target signatures such as cpa and cpg , showing that these genes were probably active before they were lost. surprisingly, masc <dig> is the only gene found in an ascomycete among the class iia group of dnmt <dig> proteins. we thus hypothesize that the specialization of this gene in only one ascomycete  and basidiomycetes  reflects a convergent evolution .

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we provide new insights into rip and other related process involving the action of c5-cytosine dna methyl-transferases during repeat silencing mechanisms in fungi. the absence of rip or its low efficiency in fungal genomes appears to be responsible for the accumulation of tes, which increase the size of the genome. we also propose a new classification system for fungal dnmt <dig> proteins based on rigorous functional annotation of domains and motifs and phylogeny of the cytosine-specific methyltransferase domain. we show that cpa and cpt dinucleotides are probably targeted by a rip process involving the rid gene, whereas cpg dinucleotides are probably targeted by another methylation-based process involving a masc2-like gene. the signatures of cpg to tpg mutations found in some te copies strongly suggest a mechanism of methyl-cytosine deamination following de novo methylation induced by a process similar to mip. in addition, we found that the rid protein of three species  containing signatures of cpt bias possessed a specific motif, suggesting that the rid gene in these three species underwent specialization to recognize this target. we propose that the rip process and the specialization of the rid gene appeared after the radiation of basidiomycota and ascomycota phyla.
