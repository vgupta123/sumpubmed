BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, non-coding rnas that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. emerging evidence has demonstrated that these small rnas are involved in almost every aspects of tumor biology and could function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . mir-34a has recently been found to act as an important tumor suppressor in the development of various cancers. a variety of genes referring to cell cycle and apoptosis control, such as cdk4/ <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  e2f <dig>  mycn, and sirt1and bcl <dig> are demonstrated to be downregulated by mir-34a  <cit> . mir-34a could also inhibit cell migration and invasion through targeting c-met  <cit> . recent data suggest that dysregulation of mir-34a exists in many types of human cancers and is correlated with clinic treatment  <cit> . although the most important regulator of mir-34a expression is the well-known tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit> , p <dig> abnormality is not always correlated with low levels of mir-34a in human cancer tissues. in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, deletion or mutation of p <dig> is associated with mir-34a downregulation  <cit> . while in neuroblastoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, no significant correlation between p <dig> mutation and mir-34a dysregulation is observed  <cit> . though researchers have reported other mechanisms for mir-34a abnormality, like deletion of 1p <dig> , aberrant cpg methylation or cebpα mutation  <cit> , more detailed study on regulation of mir-34a transcription is of great importance.

nuclear factor-kappa b  is a ubiquitously existed transcription factor regulating expression of numerous genes involving in inflammation, immune and cancer progression  <cit> . in an inactive status, nf-κb family members exist as dimmers with the predominance of p65/p <dig> heterodimers and are sequestered in the cytoplasm by members of iκb family. when nf-κb pathway is activated by a series of stimuli, iκb proteins are phosphorylated and degraded in a proteasome dependent manner leading to nuclear translocation of nf-κb and activation of downstream gene expression  <cit> . although numerous studies suggest that activation of nf-κb signal lead to resistance to apoptosis, incontrollable cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis  <cit> , there are also evidence indicating a tumor-suppressor like effect of nf-κb. different research groups have independently reported that blockade of nf-κb signal pathway caused a significant increase in spontaneous epithelial squamous cell carcinoma or diethylnitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . and also expressions of several proapoptotic genes, such as fas, puma and dr <dig> have been demonstrated to be upregulated by nf-κb  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that nf-κb might have the ability of regulating expression of tumor suppressive mirnas. interestingly, bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were several potential nf-κb binding sites located in the promoter region of mir-34a gene. so, we wondered if mir-34a was a direct target of nf-κb transcription factor. and this study was aimed to investigate whether nf-κb could directly regulate mir-34a expression and the way how they regulated.

RESULTS
nf-κb activation correlates with mir-34a expression
in order to study whether nf-κb could regulate mir-34a expression, two different approaches were used to alter nf-κb function in ec <dig> cells, an esophageal squamous cancer cell line containing wildtype p <dig> . first, we enhanced the nf-κb p <dig> levels by transfecting ec <dig> cells with a p <dig> expressing vector, cells with overexpressed p <dig> exhibited an increase of mir-34a levels compared with the vector control cells . next, we blockaded the endogenous nf-κb activity by transfecting ec <dig> cells with dominant negative iκbα which was refractory to phosphorylation mediated degradation. transfection of this mutant iκbα indeed leaded a significant reduction of nuclear nf-κb p <dig> translocation. and the expression of mir-34a was also sharply decreased in cells lacking nf-κb activity . these results suggested that nf-κb activation was needed for mir-34a expression and activation of nf-κb signal could upregulate its expression levels.

overexpression of nf-κb p <dig> subunit enhances the transcriptional activity of mir-34a
according to the bioinformatics analysis, three putative nf-κb binding sites were existed in mir-34a promoter region, located upstream of the known p <dig> bind site . to further study whether mir-34a was transcriptionally regulated by nf-κb, about  <dig>  kb dna fragment containing the three putative nf-κb binding sites and the known p <dig> binding site was cloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector . also we constructed another four reporter vectors with different κb site mutated  or p <dig> binding site mutated  . cotransfected p <dig> subunit with the wildtype reporter vector into ec <dig> resulted in a markable enhancement of luciferase activity compared with the control. mutation of the first nf-κb binding site had no impact on the transcriptional activity enhancement caused by p <dig> overexpression, while mutation of the other two greatly weakened the transactivity ability . these indicated that these two sites had critical roles in transcriptional regulation of mir-34a by nf-κb. furthermore, we also found that mutation of the p <dig> binding site in mir-34a promoter region impaired the transcriptional enhancement mediated by p <dig>  suggesting p <dig> may involve in nf-κb mediate induction of mir-34a.

nf-κb directly binds to the promoter region of mir-34a gene
since nf-κb could regulate mir-34a expression at the transcriptional level, we next investigated whether nf-κb could directly bind to the promoter region. emsa assay was first performed. two oligonucleotides were used in the experiment: 34a2kb probe containing the second κb site and 34a3Κb containing the third κb site. 34a3Κb probes were detected bound with protein of nuclear extract from ec <dig> cells, and supershift was appeared in the presence of anti-p <dig> antibody . no specific binding by nuclear extract protein was observed with 34a2Κb . these results suggested that regulatory region of mir-34a gene could be bound with nf-κb dimmers in ec <dig> cells.

then we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with ec <dig> cells to detect the binding of nf-κb in vivo. three pcr amplicons were designed: one flanking the first two κb sites in mir-34a promoter region , another flanking the third κb site  and the last one located in the intronic region of mir-34a gene served as a control . as shown in figure 3b, recruitment of p <dig> and p <dig> nf-κb subunit to the promoter region containing the third κb site was observed in ec <dig> cells. however, promoter region flanking the first two κb sites and the intronic region had no obvious enrichment of these transcription factors. furthermore, binding of these transcription factors in ec <dig> cells transfected with p <dig> were also detected. as shown in figure 3c, binding of nf-κb p <dig> and p <dig> subunits to the promoter region containing the third κb site were boosted in cells with overexpressed p <dig>  no obvious enrichment in the first two κb sites was detected in transfected cells . enhanced p <dig> binding to mir-34a promoter was observed too. these results demonstrated that increased binding of nf-κb to mir-34a promoter was indeed responsible for the induction in those transfected cells.

p <dig> is necessary for nf-κb induced mir-34a transcription but not for nf-κb binding
for mutation of the known p <dig> binding site could attenuate the effect of p <dig> on mir-34a transcriptional activity, we speculated that p <dig> may coordinate with nf-κb to regulate mir-34a transcription. in order to demonstrate this, kyse <dig>  another esophageal squamous cancer cell line containing a mutant form of p <dig>  was used in the following experiments. first, we transfected kyse <dig> cells with p <dig> expression vectors, and ectopic p <dig> expression could not successfully induced mir-34a expression . when reintroducing wildtype p <dig> into kyse <dig> cells, mir-34a induction by p <dig> overexpression was observed . in addition, we decreased p <dig> protein levels in ec <dig> cells using sirna, and found that p <dig> was unable to upregulate mir-34a expression then . these findings gave us a hint that p <dig> was required for nf-κb-mediated mir-34a induction and promoted us wondering how p <dig> affect this regulation.

we then performed luciferase reporter assay in kyse <dig> cells and ec <dig> cells with decreased p <dig> levels. unlike the performance in normal ec <dig> cells, cotransfection of p <dig> with mir-34a promoter reporter vectors  only cause a slight increase of the luciferase activity in kyse <dig> cells. and knock-down of p <dig> level dramatically impaired the transactivity enhancement caused by p <dig> . these indicated that impairment or loss of wildtype p <dig> function might affect nf-κb p65-induced transactivity of mir-34a. we next determined the binding of nf-κb subunits in kyse <dig> cells. surprisingly, nuclear extracts from kyse <dig> cells could still bound with 34a3kb probes containing the third κb site of mir-34a promoter . chip assay performed with transfected kyse <dig> cells also showed an enhancement of nf-κb binding but not p <dig> binding . these findings suggested that nf-κb binding to mir-34a promoter seems not be affected by loss of wildtype p <dig> function.

the above results suggested nf-κb could regulate mir-34a expression. since mir-34a is a known target of p <dig>  we wondered if mir-34a induction by p <dig> required nf-κb. ec <dig> cells were cotransfected with dniκb and wildtype p <dig>  however, mir-34a levels were still increased by p <dig> overexpression in cells with decreased nf-κb activity . this suggested that nf-κb might not be necessary for p53-mediated mir-34a induction.

discussion
mir-34a is an important tumor suppressive microrna, which dysregulated in many types of cancers. delicated study on its regulation mechanism is important for exploring new strategies for cancer therapy. in this study, we identified that:1) overexpression of nf-κb p <dig> subunit could increase mir-34a levels and ectopic expression of dn iκb leaded a significant reduction of mir-34a expression; 2) mutation of either the κb sites or the p <dig> binding site of mir-34a gene could impair p65-induced transcriptional activity; 3) nf-κb could specifically bind to the κb site located at - <dig> of mir-34a gene; 4) expression of mir-34a could not be induced by nf-κb in the absence of wildtype p <dig> function, probably owing to the downregulated transcriptional activity; 5) nf-κb could bind with mir-34a promoter even in cells with mutant p53; 6) nf-κb might not be necessary for p53-mediated mir-34a upregulation. according to these findings, we concluded that nf-κb could directly activate mir-34a expression at the transcriptional level and wildtype p <dig> might be responsible for the transactivity but not for nf-κb binding.

previous studies have demonstrated that mir-34a is a direct target of p <dig>  our study revealed a novel mechanism for mir-34a regulation. nf-κb is an important transcript factor linking inflammation and immunity to cancer initial and progression. it could be activated by a variety of inflammatory cytokines existing in local environment of tumors  <cit> . functioning as a downstream target of nf-κb, it is possible that mir-34a also involve in inflammation-related tumorigenesis. surprisingly, elodie roggli has recently reported that mir-34a is indeed induced by two important inflammatory cytokines, il-1β and tnfα, in human islet cells  <cit> . thus, our study indicated that besides participating in p <dig> pathway, mir-34a might play a role in tumor microenvironment network through regulation by nfkb signal pathway. however, the delicated function needs further investigation.

unlike many other transcription factors involved in cancer biology, nf-κb played a two-side role during the process of carcinogenesis. downstream genes responsible for the tumor-promoting role of nf-κb have been studied exhaustively, such as antiapoptic gene, c-flip, bcl-xl and iap family member  <cit> ; cell cycle regulator, cyclin d <dig>  <cit>  and genes referring to environmental modification, vascular endothelial growth factors   <cit>  and matrix metalloproteinases  <cit> . however, mechanism of tumor-suppressor role for nf-κb remains poorly understood. nf-kb had been reported to induce g <dig> cell cycle arrest in human epithelial cells through increasing of p21cip or suppression of cdk <dig>  <cit> . our work demonstrated mir-34a was a direct target of nf-κb. and mir-34a was verified to be able to induce cell growth arrest or apoptosis by downregulating expression of a variety of cell cycle regulator and antiapoptotic genes, including cdk <dig>  <cit> . thus, our study also revealed a potential target for nf-κb responsible to its inhibitory role in cancer progression.

in this study, we found that nf-κb-mediated mir-34a induction required wildtype p <dig> function. actually, previous studies have also demonstrated p <dig> might play a role in nf-κb mediated gene expression. for example, transcriptional activation of dr <dig> needed both nf-κb and p <dig> binding to the related sites and knock-down of p <dig> expression blocked the binding of p <dig> with dr <dig> gene.  <cit> . and also nf-κb has been reported to involve in gene transcription regulated by p <dig>  for example, nf-κb p <dig> subunit could modulate several p <dig> downstream genes transcription through binding to their promoter region  <cit> . our study revealed that nf-κb-mediated mir-34a transactivity might be affected by p <dig>  but binding of nf-κb to mir-34a promoter was independent of p <dig>  in addition, blocking nuclear translocation of nf-κb p65/p <dig> dimmers seemed to have no effect on p53-induced mir-34a expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates a novel mechanism of mir-34a regulation in human malignancies that nf-κb could regulate mir-34a expression. this is important for understanding the dysregulation of mir-34a in human cancer tissues and opens new perspectives for the function of mir-34a and nf-κb in tumor progression.
