BACKGROUND
silk fibers are derived from the cocoon of the silkworm bombyx mori, which was domesticated over the past  <dig>  years from the wild progenitor bombyx mandarina. cocoon quality is very important because it can influence the yield of sericulture and determines whether a silkworm line can be used in silk production. through the efforts of silkworm breeders over several thousands of years, many silkworm strains have been collected and conserved. moreover, the different properties of these conserved silkworm strains, such as filament length, cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, cocoon shell ratio, and cocoon color, have distinctive applications. until now, crossbreeding was the only method of enriching loci that control cocoon quality to enhance the yield from a silkworm cocoon. modern techniques involving gene cloning and marker-assisted breeding are now widely considered to be the most effective way of improving silk properties.

genetic linkage map is an essential tool for mapping traits of interest and are used in positional cloning and marker-assisted breeding. some genetic maps for the silkworm have been reported, including various genetic markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms , random amplified polymorphic dna , amplified fragment length polymorphisms , simple sequence repeats , and single nucleotide polymorphisms . ssrs  are generally accepted to be ideal markers because of their sound transferability, high reproducibility, and co-dominant inheritance. ssr markers are especially suitable for high-throughput genotyping, allowing rapid analysis of hereditary monogenetic traits and quantitative trait loci . once ssr markers were established, polymorphisms could be detected merely by visualizing pcr products on an agarose gel, and these markers are still important for the meiotic analysis of livestock and agricultural species  <cit> .

in our previous ssr linkage map  <cit> , the  <dig> robust markers reported accounted for only 20% of all identified ssrs. the number of polymorphisms was low due to reliance on parental combinations between dazao and c <dig> and to the minimal number of polymorphisms that occur between silkworm strains. because the genetic distance between markers can be as large as  <dig>  cm, fine mapping and gene cloning remain difficult.

a general approach for increasing the marker density in genetic linkage maps involves the identification of more markers and the integration of several linkage maps. xia et al.  <cit>  constructed an integrated, high-density linkage map of soybean using rflps, ssrs, sequence-tagged sites , and aflp markers. similarly, vezzulli et al.  <cit>  constructed an integrated map of grapevine using ssr and snp markers. in many cases, the maps from different parental populations and even species have been integrated  <cit> .

the choice of using the parental population of dazao and c <dig> was based mainly on its internationally consistent use in silkworm genetic research. however, neither strain is applied widely for economic production of silk-related products. in china, more than 70% of silkworm breeders use the jingsong strain for practical applications. jingsong has properties that are advantageous for silk production, such as an average filament length of  <dig> – <dig>  m. in contrast, l <dig>  which has poor silk-producing properties, possesses high stress resistance. additional matings between strains of different origins may increase the mapping efficiency of markers due to the increased potential for genetic diversity.

herein, we report an improved method for constructing silkworm ssr genetic maps with more informative loci based on new mapping populations . using this approach, we localized qtl for whole cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, cocoon shell ratio, and pupal weight. this work underpins the further cloning of genes that control properties advantageous to silk production and will be utilized further to identify molecular markers to assist in the breeding of productive silkworm lines.

RESULTS
markers in the linkage map
approximately  <dig>  ssrs isolated from our genomic libraries were subjected to polymorphism detection, including  <dig> ssrs that had been mapped  <cit> . in total,  <dig> markers were found to be polymorphic between nistari and fa50b, while  <dig> were polymorphic between lan <dig> and jingsong.

map properties
all polymorphic markers were genotyped in  <dig> segregants of the backcrosses between fa50b × nistari , or  <dig> of lan <dig> × jingsong . we analyzed the genotyping data from the inheritance pattern of bc1m populations. as a result, two new ssr linkage maps were constructed.

the linkage map constructed from the nf data consisted of  <dig> ssr markers , which covered all silkworm chromosomes except  <dig> and  <dig>  all of the maps for  <dig> lgs integrated with another fourteen gene-based loci are shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the total map length spanned  <dig>  cm with an average density of about one marker per  <dig> cm.

 <dig> paradoxical markers were removed when integrating; only the consensus data were reserved.

 <dig> anch.: anchor marker, genotyped in more than one cross

 <dig> conf.: confirmed neighboring marker

 <dig> polym.: polymorphic neighboring markers

 <dig> the total does not include information from chr. x.

whereas the linkage map constructed from the jl data consisted of  <dig> markers , they were linked to  <dig> groups and assigned to  <dig> chromosomes in the jl map. the number of markers on the linkage groups ranged from two to eight . the genetic distance ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> cm in length, and the total length of the ssr linkage map was  <dig> . <dig> cm.

information related to the markers mentioned above is provided in additional file  <dig> 

map integration
we collected dazao × c <dig>  genotyping data for map integration. markers in the merged data set were divided into  <dig> lgs and directly linked to  <dig> chromosomes according to the known sites. both chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig> corresponded to two lgs, but they only shared one anchor between the pair of lgs. as determining the interposal direction corresponding to the framework sequence was difficult, we could not construct consensus maps for these two chromosomes. nevertheless, we established a relationship for the two pairs of separated groups via single progeny mapping.

the completely integrated map contained  <dig> unique ssr sites, with a total map length of  <dig>  cm . three markers  differed significantly between the crosses and were therefore excluded during integration. s <dig> and s <dig> were placed at the ends, far from the other loci , because attached cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences  or gene-based markers were not included in map integration; two end markers , however, reserved in the nf populations were no longer obvious when integrated with the other data sets. this suggests that gaps present in a single map can be filled by integration with other data sets. the length of the integrated map was even shorter than that of the map of the dc populations, which contained  <dig> sites. the mean inter-locus distance of  <dig>  cm shows that the integrated map has a higher density .

application of the map to locus mapping
the zebra locus was mapped to chr.  <dig>  consistent with previous data  <cit> ; moreover, we found a tightly linked marker  with a map distance of  <dig>  cm . we also located a number of silkworm genes in this new mapping population. dll was positioned near fl <dig> , while twelve ribosomal protein genes  were located in nine linkage groups; the map distance to their nearest markers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm . hence, ssr linkage maps appear to be a useful and reliable tool for locating functional genes.

based on the jl data set, we identified twelve candidate loci involved in whole cocoon weight , cocoon shell weight , cocoon shell ratio , and pupal weight  . of these, six qtl were confirmed by independent analysis . q <dig> on chr.  <dig> had the most significant contribution for the three traits, accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in cw , csw , and pw . the other putative qtl  associated with cw and pw had relatively weak effects , which were localized in the neighboring region of s <dig>  q <dig> for csw was mapped to chr.  <dig>  which also contributed a relatively small effect . for csr, two qtl  were identified on chrs.  <dig> and  <dig> that accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance, respectively.

 <dig> chromosome

 <dig> the thresholds of lod for cw, csw, csr, and pw were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

 <dig> the statistical power represents the detected number of lod values that were >  <dig> in  <dig> random replicates by multi-marker joint analysis.

 <dig> q3- <dig> possesses an extremely similar lod value  for pw to q3- <dig>  in addition, their similar effects  and close positions  indicate that they may share the same region.

we also tested for epistatic genetic effects in our mapping population. a total of  <dig> pairs of loci had significant statistical power for cw, pw, and csr . most epistatic pairs involved csr, which lacked major qtl relative to the other three traits. this suggests that csr may possess more complex genetic properties than the other traits.

neighboring marker development
due to the low frequency of polymorphisms, ssr markers are limited when mapped in other strains  <cit> . the emergence of genomic sequences for the silkworm  <cit>  offered an opportunity to find substitutes in the extended region adjacent to mapped sites, and the resulting bins provided informative sites in the map. specifically,  <dig> sites were linked to draft sequences for extension, most of which were typed in only one cross. we designed  <dig> pairs of primers flanking the ssr regions for  <dig> sites, and  <dig> markers were analyzed for amplification efficiency and polymorphisms in a test panel comprising six representative strains . of these,  <dig> markers yielded reliable and distinctive bands, and  <dig> exhibited more than one band pattern. all of the confirmed neighboring markers that integrated with their original site are shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  additional file  <dig> contains the primer sequences applied in this study.

to verify the reliability of the neighboring markers, we randomly selected two pairs of polymorphic markers: ns0206/ns <dig> from dc and ns2329/ns <dig> from nf, which were genotyped in nf and dc, respectively. as illustrated in figure 2b, the orders generated by substitution were consistent with our original results.

discussion
mapping efficiency of the population
the backcross of dazao and c <dig> has been used to produce the major mapping population by several groups  <cit> . however, the density of genetic markers is generally low given the chromosome number and genome content of the silkworm. for consistency, our group has also selected this mapping population to construct the first ssr linkage map  <cit> . although, we attempted to identify more markers, the low incidence of polymorphisms  remains a major limitation that impedes the augmentation of marker density. therefore, we selected two other parental populations, jingsong × lan <dig> and fa50b × nistari, for combination. the integration of the three combinations  allowed more than  <dig> new markers to be anchored in the integrated map.

although the number of markers increased, it was below our expectations. the  <dig> markers that were initially mapped  from dc had a high percentage of polymorphisms compared to other sources . to some extent, this explains the relatively low number of new markers identified in this study: once an ssr locus was identified in one mapping population, it was more likely to be mapped in the other populations. this transitivity of polymorphisms indicates that the polymorphic loci are shared by several silkworm strains. on the other hand, the two pairs of parents used in this study had large genetic differences. however, less than 20% of the ssr markers could be mapped. these results indicate that although b. mori differentiated from b. mandarina more than  <dig>  years ago, their genomes are still highly homologous. additionally, we believe that dazao × c <dig> is the most useful population for genotyping genetic markers.

an effective strategy for developing polymorphic markers
because the efficiency of markers is low for silkworm genotyping, we developed new markers based on genomic sequences and tried to include more available information for mapping in different populations. we considered ssrs to be relatively good candidates, given the increased frequency of polymorphisms compared with other sequence-based markers . we therefore investigated the distribution of ssrs in  <dig>  mb of the silkworm genome for use in the development of neighboring markers. we predicted that certain types of ssrs would have a higher frequency of polymorphisms; thus, we sought to develop an effective strategy for identifying polymorphic markers. in this regard, the repeat motif and repeat number were taken into account.

a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified and categorized into five groups based on their motif type: n, n, n, n, and t/t . the distribution of ssrs among the five types was  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively . the abundance of n was low significantly in accordance with that reported in silkworm  <cit>  and other organisms  <cit> . next, we performed the enrichment analysis for each type of ssr in the confirmed markers and polymorphic markers, respectively. an analysis by χ <dig> testing indicated that the type of motif had a significant effect on the frequency of polymorphisms , but not on product amplification . it is accepted that amplification ability is related to the flanking sequences  rather than to the core repeat units, whereas the structure of the motif might affect sequence stability following replication. the n and t/t motifs were more polymorphic than the other motif types . for repeat number, we utilized a similar statistical method. a large number of highly repetitive ssrs were identified as candidate markers, which revealed our priority for ssrs with a longer repeat region. however, no correlations were found between the repeat number and amplification efficiency or frequency of polymorphisms .

while lacking a detailed explanation in terms of mechanism, our analysis suggests that the frequency of polymorphisms among the ssrs was related to their motif type, and that ssrs with an n or t/t motif are good candidates for the development of polymorphic markers.

distribution of ssrs in the silkworm genome
we next conducted an investigation into all available silkworm scaffolds  <cit> , corresponding to  <dig> mb, in order to determine the distribution of the ssrs. a total of  <dig>  scaffolds were used to identify  <dig>  objects with a repeat number >  <dig> . of these, the number of objects detected in  <dig>  of the scaffolds ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

 <dig> t/t represents the repeat units that comprise tri- and tetra-nucleotides.

a number of interesting observations were made concerning the genome. for example, n constituted ~40% of the di-nucleotides , while -rich repeats had an absolute majority among the tri- and tetra-nucleotide types with a large number of repeats . this dominance has not been observed in other organisms  <cit> . further investigation of the silkworm genome revealed that among those motifs with >  <dig> bases, it is somehow difficult to form long ssrs . in accordance with the dominance of -rich sequences, the percentage of n also decreased as the repeat number increased; in turn, n was found to be relatively capable of forming long ssrs.

analysis of cocoon quality using qtl
cocoon quality is an important characteristic in silkworms; however it is more difficult to map than single-factor mendelian traits. in our study, we identified at least six qtl involved in the following traits: cw, csw, csr, and pw. of these, q <dig> had simultaneous effects on cw, csw, and pw with a significant lod score and phenotypic variance. thus, this locus may be valuable for filament research. the other putative qtl  for cw, csw, and pw were distributed in the interval between s <dig> and fl <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> actually represent the double peak of the lod score from the qtl search for cw and pw, while q <dig> represents another peak of csw at a neighboring position . although these qtl were just above the threshold values, multi-marker joint analysis revealed a relationship between these traits and s <dig> or fl <dig> , confirming that this continuous region has an effect on cw, csw, and pw.

on the other hand, the genetic correlations between cw and csw, cw and pw, and csw and pw were extremely high . the clustered distribution of the qtl is suggestive of the genetic relatedness of these traits and is consistent with data showing relationships between cocoon, cocoon shell, and pupal weight.

CONCLUSIONS
the integrated linkage map described here has a greater number of sites and more than one optional marker for most sites, and is more efficient for a range of applications. in combination with recent silkworm genomic data  <cit> , the fine mapping and positional cloning of interesting traits will be realized more easily. the identification of target genes will in turn facilitate detailed research of insect innate immunity, metamorphosis, hormone metabolism, and the genetic improvement of economical strains with high stress resistance.
