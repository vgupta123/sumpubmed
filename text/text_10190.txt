BACKGROUND
homeobox  proteins were first discovered in drosophila. they are a superfamily of transcriptional factor proteins containing a conserved 60-amino acid homeodomain . hb proteins have been found in all eukaryotic organisms tested  <cit> . in plants, a great number of hd-containing transcriptional factors have been identified in both monocots and dicots  <cit> , with knotted <dig> being the first identified hd-containing protein  <cit> . the hb protein superfamily is classified into six families based on hd sequence, location, association with other functional domains, and the protein size and structure. these classifications are: homeodomain-leucine , plant homeodomain -finger, bell, zinc finger-homeodomain , wuschel -related homeobox , and knotted1-like-homeobox   <cit> .

the wox family of hb proteins is distinguished by the phylogenetic relatedness of its homeodomain, and is a plant specific hb transcription factor family  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes at least  <dig> wox proteins, and these are classified into three clades:  <cit>  a modern/wus clade including wus and atwox1-7; an intermediate clade including atwox <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 12; and an ancient clade containing atwox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . arabidopsis woxs regulate key developmental processes including stem cell maintenance in the sam, ram, and cam, embryo apical-basal polarity patterning, and lateral organ development  <cit> . atwus, a member of the modern wox clade, is expressed specifically in the organizing center of the sam, and is required for maintaining stem cells via a feedback loop with clv <dig>  a peptide ligand that interacts with leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases in neighboring cells to restrict the size of the sam in arabidopsis <cit> . atwox <dig>  also a member of the modern wox clade, is expressed in root quiescent centre  cells surrounded by the stem cells  <cit> . the atwox <dig> protein is essential for stem cell maintenance via a negative feedback signal provided by cle <dig>  <cit> . atwox <dig> is strongly expressed in the cam, and regulates vascular stem cell maintenance  <cit> . atwox <dig> is expressed in zygotes, and is involved in regulating cell fate in the apical and basal lineage of developing embryos  <cit> . atwox3/prs <dig> is involved in lateral organ development through recruiting organ founder cells forming the lateral domain in arabidopsis <cit> . atwox <dig> is expressed abundantly in developing ovules, and is involved in either ovule patterning or differentiation  <cit> . with regards to stem cell maintenance in the sam and ram, it is noteworthy that atwus and atwox <dig> are interchangeable  <cit> . furthermore, the function of atwox <dig> in lateral organ development can be fully complemented by atwus  <cit> , and partially complemented by atwox <dig>  <cit> . taken together, it appears there is a common mechanism of action among modern wox proteins. it has recently been demonstrated that members of the modern wox clade have evolved, through the acquisition of a conserved wus-box, a repressive activity important for leaf blade outgrowth regulation  <cit> .

for the intermediate woxs, atwox <dig>  co-expressed with atwox <dig> in the zygote, is required for normal development of the pre-embryo  <cit> . similar to atwox <dig> in arabidopsis, pawox8/ <dig> is highly expressed at the early zygotic growth stages and the later embryo stages in picea abies <cit> . the atwox <dig> gene is involved in maintaining cell division and preventing premature differentiation in the arabidopsis sam  <cit> . the expression patterns and function of atwox <dig> and  <dig> are currently unknown in arabidopsis, but oswox <dig> in rice is reported to be required for activating shoot-borne root development by directly repressing rr <dig>  a cytokinin type-a responsive regulator gene  <cit> .

with regards to the most conserved ancient plant wox proteins, the expression and function of atwox <dig> is unknown. although atwox <dig> is expressed ubiquitously it is most strongly expressed in developed flowers and young siliques, where it is involved in the promotion of replum formation during fruit development  <cit> . atwox <dig> is thought to prevent premature differentiation of primary roots, lateral roots, and floral organs  <cit> . atwox <dig> is predominantly expressed in vascular tissues and acts redundantly with atwox <dig> in vascular cell differentiation  <cit> .

poplars are a widely distributed group of economic plants. as a rapid growth species, vegetative growth leads to higher production of plant biomass  <cit> , thus poplars are considered as feedstocks for bioenergy and timber  <cit> . populus tomentosa is a chinese native poplar species with a high economic value and is widely planted in northern china. because of the key roles that wox proteins play in stem cell maintenance and lateral organ development, wox proteins are potential targets for better and faster growth of p. tomentosa. here, we identify  <dig> wox encoding genes in p. tomentosa . we provide a comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of the ptowoxs. we reveal that although members of all three wox clades exist in p. tomentosa, ptowoxs expanded differently from those of arabidopsis. the expression of ptowoxs was found to differ from their arabidopsis counterparts, with many showing significant expression in the roots, and being inducible in the regeneration of adventitious roots . furthermore, we report that the ectopic expression of ptowoxs from both modern and intermediate wox clades promotes the regeneration of ars.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of wox genes in populus trichocarpa and p. tomentosa
the p. tomentosa genome has not been sequenced. therefore, to initiate functional analysis of woxs in p. tomentosa we searched for wox genes in the sequenced genome of p. trichocarpa, a poplar species physiologically close to p. tomentosa. we used all  <dig> known arabidopsis wox protein sequences as queries to blast against the p. trichocarpa genome database. eighteen wox gene sequences were identified in the p. trichocarpa genome; this is similar to the number of woxs found in arabidopsis   <cit> , oryza sativa   <cit> , zea mays   <cit> , and vitis vinifera   <cit> . the putative wox proteins in p. trichocarpa  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length . a phylogenetic tree of wox proteins from p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis was generated based on the full wox amino acid sequences . similar to the hd sequence based phylogeny of known plant wox proteins  <cit> , the  <dig> ptrwoxs fell into three major branches: the modern/wus clade, the intermediate clade, and the ancient clade; these were similar to their arabidopsis counterparts . the modern/wus clade contained  <dig> ptrwoxs; these could be divided into five subclasses based on their relationship with their arabidopsis counterparts. these were named as ptrwus, ptrwox <dig>  ptrwox <dig>  ptrwox <dig>  and ptrwox <dig>  the intermediate clade consisted of four ptrwoxs; these were classified into two subclasses: ptrwox8/ <dig>  and ptrwox11/ <dig>  the ancient clade contained only one subclass: ptrwox <dig>  this classification was further confirmed by the exon/intron organization of the wox coding sequences in p. trichocarpa and arabidposis . with the exception of ptrwox8/9a and ptrwox11/12b, all other ptrwox genes shared a similar intron/exon organization in the size and arrangement of introns and exons with their corresponding atwox counterparts.

arabidopsis woxs
*arabidopsis wox genes that are closely classified with ptrwoxs according to the phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences.

all ptrwoxs contained highly conserved hd residues . a conserved wus-box domain  located downstream of the hd domain  <cit>  was also found in members of the modern clade, but not in the other clades . in addition, an ear-like domain was present in the c-terminal ends of ptrwusa, ptrwusb, ptrwox5a, and ptrwox5b .

although the  <dig> ptrwoxs could be classified into modern/wus clade, intermediate, or ancient clades, it is interesting that ptrwoxs may have expanded differently in arabidopsis . two copies of ptrwoxs could be classified as wus , wox <dig> , wox <dig> , wox <dig> , wox8/ <dig> , and wox11/ <dig> , and three copies of ptrwoxs could be classified as wox <dig>  and wox <dig> . however, no ptrwoxs were closely related to atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  and atwox <dig> in the phylogenetic tree . similarly, close orthologs of atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  and atwox <dig> were missing from vitis vinifera <cit> , picea abies <cit> , and other woody plant species  <cit> . details of these ptrwox encoding genes, including their corresponding arabidopsis counterparts, and amino acid lengths are listed in table  <dig> 

using primers specific to each ptrwox gene , we identified and cloned  <dig> corresponding wox genes from p. tomentosa . we found that ptowoxs and ptrwoxs shared very high amino acid sequence similarities  and cds sequence identities . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ptowoxs could be classified identically to ptrwoxs .

chromosomal location and gene duplication of wox genes in p. trichocarpa
to better understand how wox genes expanded in poplars, we took advantage of the sequenced genome of p. trichocarpa and mapped the chromosomal location of the  <dig> ptrwox loci. these  <dig> ptrwox sequences were unevenly distributed among the  <dig> chromosomes, with the exception of chromosomes iii, vi, xiii, xvi, and xviii . the chromosomal duplication map of p. trichocarpa was generated previously  <cit> . we identified five pairs of ptrwox genes, ptrwox1a-ptrwox1b, ptrwox4a-ptrwox4b, ptrwox5a-ptrwox5b, ptrwox11/12a-ptrwox11/12b, and ptrwox13b-ptrwox13c in the duplicated segments of the p. trichocarpa genome. this suggests that expansion of the ptrwox gene family was, at least partially, caused by chromosomal duplication events during the evolution of poplar species.

nuclear localization of ptowoxs
as a first step towards understanding the functions of woxs in p. tomentosa, we examined the subcellular localization of ptowusa, ptowox4a, ptowox5a, ptowox11/12a, and ptowox13c members of selected ptowox subclasses. as transcription factors, woxs should be targeted to the nucleus. to test this, we fused yfp at n-termini of ptowusa, ptowox4a, ptowox5a, and ptowox11/12a and the c-terminus of ptowox13c. in a transient expression assay of nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells all fusion proteins were found in the nucleus .

diversified expression patterns of ptowox genes
to gain insights into possible developmental and physiological functions of wox proteins in p. tomentosa, the expression pattern of wox genes in p. tomentosa carr. were analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . two ptowox2s and two ptowox11/12 s were mainly expressed in the roots. in contrast, ptowusb, and three ptowox1s were nearly absent from roots. further to this, ptowox1a and 1b were only expressed in leaves and ptowox1c only in the stem. ptowox5a and ptowox8/9a were highly expressed in both roots and leaves, while ptowox8/9b was expressed in both roots and stem. it is noteworthy that ptowusa, ptowusb, ptowox4a, and ptowox4b were strongly expressed in the cam zone of poplar stems. in arabidopsis, atwus is only expressed in the sam  <cit> . in addition to the enrichment of ptowusa and ptowusb in the cam zone, ptowusa was also expressed, albeit weakly, in roots, leaves, and stems. similarly, atwox <dig> is restricted to the ram  <cit> , while ptowox5b was ubiquitously expressed. the only subclass of the ancient wox clade in poplars, ptowox13s , also exhibited a ubiquitous expression pattern. in a separate research project conducted in our laboratory, we generated a set of rna-seq data for the hybrid poplar populus alba x populus glandulosa. quantification of expression of the corresponding  <dig> wox genes in p. alba x p. glandulosa  indicated that the expression pattern of  <dig> pagwox genes in the hybrid poplar was similar to that of the  <dig> ptowox genes in p. tomentosa, though there was a discrepancy between ptowusb and pagwusb.

promoter::gus based analysis of expression of ptowox genes
rt-pcr is a rapid way to examine tissue specificity of gene expression, but it does not provide a good resolution. since we are interested in the process of the root growth and wood formation in populus tomentosa, a root-specific ptowox11/12a, a root-enriched ptowox5a, and two generally expressed but cam enriched ptowoxs  were selected for promoter::gus assays to examine their expressions in detail. due to ease of genetic manipulation, the hybrid poplar p. alba x p. glandulosa, a close relative of p. tomentosa, was chosen for gene transformation. in arabidopsis, atwox <dig> is expressed specifically in the qc cells in the root tips  <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr results revealed that in addition to being strongly expressed in the roots ptowox5a was weakly expressed in the leaves . the promoter::gus assays indicated that ptowox5a was mainly expressed in a small area behind the cap region of ars in the pptowox5a::gus transformed hybrid poplar . the ptowox5a promoter had a weak activity in the leaves . semi-quantitative rt-pcr identified ptowox11/12a as a root specific wox gene in p. tomentosa . a gus assay confirmed it was only expressed in the roots, especially in a small region behind the ar cap . based on the semi-quantitative expression analysis revealed ptowusa and ptopwox4a were strongly expressed in the cam zone, but were detectable in other examined tissues . gus staining  revealed that ptowusa and ptopwox4a were both strongly expressed in the cam zone of stems ; they were also weakly expressed in roots  as gus staining of roots of transgenic lines expressing either pptowusa::gus or pptowox4a::gus occurred after a prolonged period. interestingly, in the pptowusa::gus lines, a small region behind the root cap could be stained , though activity of pptowusa::gus was not limited to this small region in roots. in pptowox4a::gus transgenic lines, the small region behind the root cap region was not stained, but the root cap region of ars could be stained .

dynamic expression of ptowoxs during the regeneration of adventitious shoots and roots in p. tomentosa
the regeneration of adventitious shoot  and ar using leaf or stem explants is one of the best tools for rapid propagation and genetic manipulation of poplars. these regeneration processes involve the re-establishment of sam and ram, which leads to the final differentiation of leaves and roots. therefore regeneration of as and ar is an excellent system for studying stem cell initiation, cell fate determination, and hormonal signaling  <cit> . as regeneration is composed of several successive stages, including the b <dig> pre-induction stage , the b <dig> callus induction stage , the b <dig> callus expansion stage , the b <dig> callus transition stage , the b <dig> as formation stage , and the b <dig> as growth stage . to investigate whether ptowoxs play roles in the regeneration of as we examined the dynamics of ptowox expression using quantitative real-time pcr. among the  <dig> ptowoxs,  <dig> had significant changes in expression during as regeneration . the expression levels of ptowusa, ptowox4a, ptowox4b, ptowox5a, and ptowox5b changed over twenty-fold during the regeneration of as. they had different expression dynamics with maximum expression of ptowox4a/b seen at earlier stages , and ptowox5a/b at later stages  . all three ptowox13s were expressed at a relatively low level in as regeneration but were slightly induced during the as regeneration process . in contrast, expression of ptowox1a and 1b was slightly down-regulated in as regeneration. this down-regulation of ptowox1s may be a technical artifact as both ptowox1s were expressed specifically in leaves, thus their expression in the b <dig> stage may be still at a high level. nevertheless, we view this as an indication that ptowox1s are not involved in sam and as regeneration. finally, transcription of ptowox2a, ptowox2b, ptowox11/12a, and ptowox11/12b, whose expression was mainly in the roots, was unchanged during as regeneration.

ar regeneration is composed of a r <dig> pre-induction stage , r <dig> callus formation stage , r <dig> ar emergence stage , and a r <dig> ar elongation stage . we examined the dynamics of ptowoxs expression to gain insights into their possible roles in these processes. expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> ptowoxs was detected and changed during the ar regeneration process . among these, expression of four wox genes: ptowox5a, ptowox5b, ptowox11/12a, and ptowox11/12b changed significantly during ar regeneration . the expression of ptowox11/12a was over 80-fold stronger and maintained a high level in the r <dig> though r <dig> stages. ptowox11/12b was induced at the r <dig> and r <dig> stages, but not at the r <dig> or r <dig> stage. it is interesting that although expression of ptowox5a and ptowox5b was induced at the r <dig> stage, their expression gradually decreased in the following stages. similarly, root specific woxs were not induced in as regeneration; the expression levels of ptowox1a and ptowox1b, two leaf-specific wox genes in p. tomentosa , were not changed.

ectopic expression of ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a as along with ptowusa and ptowox4a promotes ar regeneration
because of the high expression of ptowox5s, ptowox11/12 s, ptowusa, and ptowox4a in the roots, and the strong induction of ptowox5s and ptowox11/12 s in the regeneration of ar, we were interested in the roles they play in the ar regeneration process. we used a 35s promoter to ectopically express ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a along with ptowusa and ptowox4a in the hybrid poplar . ar regenerated in stem segments of three independent transgenic plants were quantified at the young sapling stage. all four ectopically expressed wox genes promoted ar regeneration in the transgenic hybrid poplar lines . it appeared that ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a had a better ability than ptowusa and ptowox4a to promote the regeneration of ar. this is consistent with the strong induction of ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a in the regeneration of ar. although the expression of ptowusa and ptowox4a was not obviously induced , their effect on the regeneration of ars when ectopically expressed indicated that the four ptowox genes may have overlapping functions.

discussion
diversification of wox genes in p. trichocarpa and p. tomentosa
we identified  <dig> wox encoding genes in both p. trichocarpa and p. tomentosa. although these poplar wox genes could be categorized into modern/wus, intermediate, and ancient clades, it is interesting that no wox genes from p. trichocarpa and p. tomentosa are classified together with atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  or atwox <dig>  furthermore, many of the wox genes in p. trichocarpa had sister copies owing to chromosomal duplication events.

while the roles of atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> are not well defined, atwox <dig> is expressed in leaves and involved in leaf blade outgrowth  <cit> . moreover, the function of the atwox <dig> protein can be fully complemented by atwus  <cit> , and partially complemented by atwox <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that the wox3-mediated function of leaf blade outgrowth regulation is compensated by other modern wox members in poplars. in this regard, we note that the ptowox1a gene and ptowox1b gene are specifically expressed in p. tomentosa leaves .

arabidopsis contains three ancient wox genes, atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  and atwox <dig>  p. trichocarpa and p. tomentosa also have three ancient wox genes, ptrwox13a, b, and c; these are very similar in sequence, with ptrwox13b and ptrwox13c being sister pairs. grape also has three ancient wox genes, vvwox13a, b, and c.  <cit> . there appears to be functional diversification in atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  and atwox14; the atwox <dig> gene is involved in replum formation during fruit development  <cit> , atwox <dig> acts redundantly with atwox <dig> in vascular cell division  <cit> , while the role of atwox <dig> is unknown. the three ancient wox genes of p. trichocarpa and p. tomentosa are ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissue in poplars . it is possible that the diversified functions of ancient atwox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in arabidopsis may be maintained by three ancient wox genes, namely wox13a, b, and c in poplars.

expression of ptowox genes
protein function can be specified in terms of temporally and spatially regulated gene expression. we note that some ptowoxs genes are expressed differently from their arabidopsis counterparts . atwus is expressed specifically in the rib-meristem  cells beneath the central zone of the sam, and it maintains the stem cell population via a regulatory loop with clavata genes in arabidopsis <cit> . in poplar, the expression of ptowusa is not limited to the sam and is strongly induced in the regeneration of as; it is also detected in roots, stem and leaves , and particularly in the cam zone of stems. a major difference between arabidopsis and poplar is that the latter is a perennial plant with annual differentiation of vascular tissues from cam. it seems that the ptowusa gene may also be involved in vascular tissue differentiation. in arabidopsis, the atwox <dig> gene is required for vascular differentiation from cam cells  <cit> . both ptowox4a and ptowox4b genes are strongly expressed in cam cells and are strongly induced in as regeneration, but not in ar regeneration . therefore, differently from ptowusa, the function of the ptowox <dig> gene in cam cells may be maintained in poplars. it will be interesting to test whether ptowusa and ptowox <dig> act differently in vascular tissue differentiation in poplars.

atwox <dig> is a qc cell specific gene in arabidopsis <cit> . it seems that functional expansion also occurs for ptowox5s. in poplars, the ptowox5a gene is strongly expressed in a small region that resembles qc cells, but is also detectable in young leaves . furthermore, ptowox5a expression is strongly induced in the regeneration of ar as well as in the as. therefore, we speculate that the function of ptowox5a and ptowox5b may have expanded from roots to leaves in poplars.

although the expression pattern of atwox <dig> in arabidopsis has not been reported, expression of oswox <dig> in rice is detected in cell division regions of both roots and shoots  <cit> . we note that expression of both ptowox11/12 s is restricted to a small area behind the root cap region that resembles the root qc in ar tips, and probably the pericycle . thus, the action of ptowox11/12 s may be restricted to root development in poplars. during the regeneration of ar, the expression levels of ptowox11/12 s and ptowox5s are all strongly induced; however, it is interesting that the expression of ptowox11/12a is induced at the r <dig> stage, while the expression of ptowox11/12b is induced at the r <dig> stage. it is likely that ptowox11/12a acts differently from ptowox11/12b in the regeneration of ar.

four ptowox proteins can perform similar functions in promoting ar regeneration
a key function of wox proteins is to maintain the stem cell population in different tissues and organs  <cit> . recently, it has been demonstrated  <cit>  by using a lam <dig> complementation screen of wox proteins in n. sylvestris that modern members of wox proteins may have acquired additional functions during evolution that lead to functional specificity of this clade in the regulation of leaf blade outgrowth. in this study, we found that when ectopically expressed, three members of the modern woxs  and a member of the intermediate woxs  promote ar regeneration . in our promoter::gus based expression analysis, the ptowusa, ptowox5a, and ptowox11/12a genes are expressed in a small region in the root tips resembling qc cells, the ptowox4a gene however, was not expressed in restricted areas in the root tips. therefore, it is likely that members of the modern and intermediate woxs can perform similar functions in the regeneration of ar in poplars, even if the gene is not normally expressed in root tip cells.

there is a clear divergence in the amino acid sequences of the  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> poplar wox proteins, with only modern wox proteins possessing a wus-box domain. lin et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the wus-box is required for the regulation of leaf blade outgrowth. many different woxs act in different cells and tissues to maintain the stem cell population  <cit> , thus a common action mechanism for wox proteins in maintaining the stem cell niche has been proposed  <cit> . our results add support to this viewpoint. the regeneration of ar relies on a balance between cell differentiation and renewal of stem cells in the ram  <cit> . it is possible that ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a, whose genes are expressed and strongly induced in the regeneration of ar, are major players in maintaining the stem cell niche in root tips. however, the function of ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a in maintaining the stem cell niche in root tips may be partially overlapped by ptowusa or ptowox4a. when the latter two ptowox genes are ectopically expressed they promote the regeneration of ar. this functional overlapping may be attributed to a common mechanism for maintaining the stem cell niche. it is possible that a wox domain other than the wus-box is responsible for this common action. it will be interesting to examine which wox domains have evolutionary significance in the function of woxs in stem cell maintenance.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents a step forward in our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of  <dig> woxs found in poplar, in particular, their possible roles in vascular as well as root development of poplars. based on the expression of ptowox genes revealed in this study, it is attempted to suggest that, in poplars, ptowox4s and ptowuss are involved in vascular development, while ptowox5s and prowox11/12s are major players in root development. despite these possible functional specificities, it appears that there is a common action mechanism for different ptowoxs in maintaining different stem cell niches.
