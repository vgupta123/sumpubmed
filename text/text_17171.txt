BACKGROUND
a prokaryotic spore is a type of resting cell whose function is mainly to guard the genetic information of an organism during unfavorable conditions and to help its spreading. spore germination is the subsequent developmental step that transfers these cells from their dormant state into metabolically active vegetative growth. how the metabolically inactive dormant spore is adapted for eventual germination, how cell metabolism is reactivated and how the cell is differentiated during this process are the questions that attract our attention. the genus streptomyces is used here as a model organism. streptomycetes are important producers of clinically important antibiotics, and their antibiotic production is an object of intensive scientific interest  <cit> . the complex cell differentiation of streptomycetes comprises the formation of vegetative substrate mycelium, aerial mycelium and sporulation . in the model species s. coelicolor, spore formation is preceded by twisting of the aerial hyphae, followed by a synchronized cell division of the hyphae, leading to the formation of haploid compartments. these compartments assemble an envelope layer with a hydrophobic external sheath. the coat is composed from chaplin and rodlin hydrophobic proteins that form a basket-like structure, for more details see review  <cit> . the resulting spores then undergo maturation, during which their water content is decreased and a grey pigment is produced. although streptomycetes spores are quite resistant to desiccation, their spores are less resistant to other environmental extremes than endospores of clostridia or bacilli. therefore, they can rather be seen as dispersal agents  <cit> .

whereas sporulation and antibiotic production are well studied, much less attention has been paid to germination. spores are re-activated from dormancy in an aqueous medium. spores lose their hydrophobicity, which leads to water influx and thus swelling. germination may be stimulated by heat shock  <cit>  or by mechanical incidences that disrupt the external sheath .

the development of dormant spores into vegetative forms is a sequential process. first, hydrolytic enzymes such as rpfa and swla degrade cell wall peptidoglycans  <cit> . after 60 min of incubation, intensive ribosome synthesis occurs  <cit> . this phase is characterized by enhanced rates of rna and protein synthesis and the first dna replication occurs between  <dig> – 150 min. then germination tubes rise through the outer spore wall and vegetative hyphae start branching  <cit> . previous studies of streptomyces development including germination  mostly relied on proteomics  or the combination of proteomics and transcriptomics  <cit>  approaches.

genome wide analytic methods, such as microarrays or transcriptome sequencing followed by biocomputational modeling  <cit>  offers a global view of gene/protein expression guiding the characterization of complex regulatory networks. expression data obtained from these experiments are then used to estimate the levels of individual proteins. however, specifically with respect to germination, we are as yet unable to distinguish which expression levels of different mrnas, identified by microarrays, are critical for the appropriate functioning of their protein products. in the present study, microarray data were processed to determine how and at which stage of germination gene expression changes become significant. this approach provides new details that contribute to our understanding of the germination process on a global scale.

in order to have a view on the gene expression dynamics of the different genes specifically expressed in the course of the germination process, we collected rna samples every 30-min from dormant spores and up to  <dig>  h of growth after heat shock  from at least three biological replicates.

RESULTS
the aim of this work was to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two consecutive time points during the germination of s. coelicolor. analyzing differential expression allowed us to identify genes and, consequently, metabolic and regulatory pathways whose expressions were enhanced or diminished between the two time points.

throughout the paper, all references to the changes in gene expression levels concern the ratio between expression levels in time point tj+ <dig> and tj . the terms used are usually: “enhanced/diminished expression”, or “up/down regulation”, or “activation/deactivation”. these terms have no relation to actual molecular mechanism that led to the changes in expression levels of a particular gene, but refer solely to the above mentioned expression levels ratios. by determining the genes with enhanced/diminished expression, we can infer changes in the corresponding pathway map over the observed germination period and correlate these changes with morphological and physiological development.

germination was monitored from dormant state of spores up to  <dig>  h of growth after heat spore activation, and rna samples were collected at 30-min intervals from at least three biological replicates . the sample set contained data from  <dig> time points, including dormant and activated spores. the signals from microarray spots corresponding to individual genes were arranged in a dataset for further processing. genes whose expression was enhanced or diminished between two consecutive time points were identified by t-test for equality of means, and genes that exhibited significant change were checked for the fold change. those genes, whose expression changed by more than 2-fold, were selected . altogether, increased abundance was observed for  <dig> individual genes at least once between two consecutive time points, and decreased abundance was observed for  <dig> genes. almost one third  of the genes in the enhanced set and  <dig> genes in the diminished set were classified as “unknown” or “not classified” , and another  <dig> genes in the enhanced set and  <dig> in the diminished set were classified as hypothetical. in order to identify the metabolic pathways in which the identified genes were involved, the kegg  database of s. coelicolor genes and their pathway ontologies was downloaded  <cit> . for s. coelicolor, the kegg database records  <dig> individual genes assigned to  <dig> pathways and  <dig> functional groups . the groups “biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites”, “cell motility”, and “glycan biosynthesis and metabolism” were excluded from this set, as the expression of less than  <dig> genes was significantly changed. distribution of the genes to individual metabolic groups followed the scheme given by kegg and will be used throughout the paper. altogether,  <dig> individual genes that were induced and  <dig> that were repressed at least once between two consecutive time points throughout the whole observed period were identified among the genes recorded in kegg. this set was complemented with  <dig> sigma factors whose analysis is discussed further below.figure  <dig>

most of the genes were differentially induced between points t2-t <dig>  and t7-t <dig> . by contrast, most of the diminished genes were detected at the onset of germination between time points t <dig> and t <dig>  in practical terms, the highest decrease in individual gene expression occurring between t1-t <dig> indicated that a considerable mrna pool persisted in the dormant spores and was degraded during their activation . in between these time points, metabolic activity was constant; expression of the genes in the active pathways was neither enhanced nor diminished, within the experimental error limits. most pathways were diminished in the first time interval, during which the levels for most of the messengers of the incident pathways were declining. subsequently, the number of pathways down regulated remained on the level of the experimental error. the number of enhanced/diminished genes assigned to individual functional groups is shown in figure  <dig> 

the profiles in figure 5a follow two trends – the first and largest copied the course of the whole set , and the second exhibited a maximum in the first time interval  ; in other time points, the numbers of genes with enhanced expression randomly fluctuated.figure  <dig>

transcription/translation


genes of the tca cycle followed the general course, being down regulated in the first time interval and reactivated in the second time interval . as we do not expect decreased demand for carbohydrate metabolism during this period, the initial deactivation was most likely caused by the degradation of mrnas persevered from dormancy, as discussed above. considering the centrality of the tca cycle, it is not surprising that it represented almost half of the carbohydrate metabolism genes that were induced in t2-t <dig>  the second gene reactivation in t7-t <dig> may correspond to an increase in the demand for energy metabolism possibly due to the initiation of the first replication round and active growth. genes characteristic of oxidative phosphorylation encode nadh dehydrogenase and atp synthase subunits. however, unexpectedly the expression of nadh dehydrogenase subunits was repressed during the t7-t <dig> time interval. since germination is a very energy demanding process, nadh dehydrogenase and atp synthase mrnas were either already present in dormant spores or constitutively expressed in the following periods.

genes of lipid metabolism were activated after the initiation of germination  and included mostly genes of fatty acid biosynthesis pathways , namely, acetyl-coa acetyltransferase  and acyl-coa carboxylase complex . curiously, there are two exceptions - acetyl coa carboxylase and acetyltransferase  that were down regulated at t1-t <dig> 

our previous work highlighted the crucial role of the chaperones dnak, groel and trigger factor in the refolding of aggregated proteins during the initiation of germination  <cit> . here, we also show that the expression of dnak, a member of folding, sorting and degradation group, is enhanced after the initiation of germination . interestingly, the activation of chaperones was accompanied by the activation of preprotein translocase, which is a membrane transporter for secretory proteins  <cit> . this indicates the activity of secretory pathways, wherein these particular chaperones could be involved to guard the transport of preproteins. as could be seen from table  <dig>  the genes corresponding to pathways  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  that belongs to the amino acid metabolism group, were not found to be activated in the t7-t <dig> interval. tyr, phe and trp are aromatic amino acids, being produced by the shikimate pathway  <cit> . this suggests that the expression of the shikimate pathway is coordinated during germination and is mainly expressed during the t2-t <dig> period.

opposed to other metabolic groups, transcription-associated pathways were not deactivated in any time interval during germination. the expression of genes involved in the transcription machinery was induced in the t2-t <dig> time interval, when most mrnas from dormancy have been degraded and new rnas and proteins have to be synthesized. the most activated were the rna polymerase complex genes.

in contrast to transcription, translation-related pathways, including aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis pathway and some ribosomal proteins, were down regulated during spore rehydration . this suggests that dormant spores are equipped with all the components needed to restart active protein synthesis. the translation-related pathways, as the transcription-related pathways, were also induced in the t2-t <dig> time interval. during this time interval, the expression of genes encoding a number of ribosomal proteins  was activated. ribosomal proteins together with aminoacyl-trna synthetase raised again in the 150–180 min interval . during this time interval the initiation of the first dna replication is expected. this indicates that germinating cells adjust the number of ribosomes and thus protein synthesis to the increase of metabolic activity linked to active growth.

the expression of most of the functional groups was diminished during the first period . in fact, as a dormant spore is metabolically inactive, the time point t <dig>  corresponds to the total amount of mrna synthesized during spore formation stably maintained during dormancy. we speculate that a maturing spore is most likely “not able to predict” the future conditions under which the germination will start. its transcriptome should potentially be programmed to cover the basic requirements to initiate growth from the storage components present in spores. when germination starts, the expression of the genes required to adjust to the specific environmental conditions is triggered. other resting mrnas that are not required are degraded. with this in mind, it is not surprising that the expression of most genes was diminished in the subsequent period t2-t <dig>  over the course of germination, the number of genes with diminished expression decreased and fluctuated around just a few genes. exceptions to this rule were the “membrane transport”  and “signal transduction” groups, which followed the characteristic profile of the genes with enhanced expression, i.e., with two maxima between time points t2-t <dig> and t7-t <dig> 

sigma factors
strakova et al., showed which proteins were highly expressed during germination  <cit> ; the analysis presented here shows the changes in expression. interestingly, the latter approach revealed several regulators , which do not need to be expressed at high levels but must be active at the exact time when their action is required. the sigma subunits of rna polymerase are regulatory elements that dictate which genes will be transcribed. here,  <dig> genes annotated as sigma factors were analyzed for differential expression between two consecutive time points. of the  <dig> sigma factors, expression of  <dig> was significantly and at least twofold enhanced between at least two consecutive time points. the differential expression profiles of these genes are shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
differential expression profiles of sigma factors induced during germination. sigma factors are sorted according to the time point in which their expression was enhanced  and the fold-increase in expression level between consecutive time points . only intervals with significant changes are displayed.



most of the sigma factors were activated in the first phase of germination between time points t1-t <dig>  and t2-t <dig> , including the known sigma factor sigr, sige, hrdd, sigd and sigh. the highest enhancement in the t2-t <dig> period was observed for the expression of sigr  and sige , whereas hrdd and sigd were induced  <dig> × and 3×, respectively, in the same period. this is in agreement with the fact that the cells enter into a metabolically and morphologically different type.

in the t1-t <dig> time interval, the expression of four other sigma factors with unknown function  was also greatly enhanced, more than 10-fold for sco <dig>  and more than 3-fold for the others. the target genes of these sigma factors are unknown. however, since sco <dig> bears  <dig> % identity with sigr , we propose that this factor controls protein aggregation during the spore activation, as previously suggested for sigr. although its expression was significantly diminished  in the t3-t <dig> interval, the degree of sco <dig> down regulation was much lower than that of its up regulation in the first interval, indicating an adjustment of its level to a constant value necessary for subsequent growth.

the sigma factor sco <dig>  whose expression was also enhanced in the t1-t <dig> interval, possesses  <dig> % identity with sigw of bacillus subtilis
 <cit>  that is involved in the response to cell wall damaging treatments, including the degradation by active hydrolases. the activation of sco <dig> at t1-t <dig>  and its down regulation at the following interval  are of comparable magnitude, indicating that this gene is switched off after 30 min of growth.

another gene, sco0194/lits  <cit> , was up regulated in t1-t <dig>  but also to relatively high levels  between time points t4-t <dig>  lits is an ecf sigma factor, whose expression is induced by light. this factor directs the expression of the carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster. carotenoids scavenge free radicals and thus protect cells from photo-oxidative damage  <cit> . as the germination experiment took place in daylight, the reactivation of lits synthesis may suggest that the spore coats are disrupted, thereby allowing light to enter the cell. indeed, spores lose their refractibility at the stage of lits activation, as clearly seen with light microscopy.

sige
streptomycete cell wall anchor csec sensor and cseb response regulator constitute a signal transduction system responding to various cell wall damages. so its activity is induced by cell wall-specific antibiotics or by the cell wall hydrolytic enzyme lysozyme  <cit> . the cseb-c two-component system controls the transcription of sige. both sige and cseb mutants exhibit an identical phenotype that is manifested by cell envelope defects  <cit> . the cell wall weakness is caused by breaks introduced by internal cell wall hydrolases that are involved in reconstructing the growing cell envelope from the rigid and robust spore coat. therefore, these hydrolases are mostly active during the initial stages of germination  <cit> . our measurements revealed the sequential up regulation of three of these hydrolases: swlc was induced  <dig> × at t3-t <dig>  rpfa was induced  <dig> × at t6-t <dig>  and swla was induced  <dig> × at t8-t <dig>  we think that as a means of recovering the destructive role of these hydrolases, the ecf member sige  is activated in advance to govern their regulon and to manage the process of cell wall reconstruction.

sigr
the minimal water content of dormant streptomyces spores causes proteins to aggregate. however, as it was shown previously  <cit> , the protein system regains full functionality during germination. the process of protein refolding is controlled by the activity of molecular chaperones, which are abundant and massively expressed during the initial stages of germination. as an example found here, the expression of chaperone dnak was enhanced  at t2-t <dig> 

other stresses such as disulfide stress also leads to protein aggregation. this results in the activation of the sigr regulon, which comprises the dnak  and clpb chaperones, among others. the expression of the latter was moderately but constitutively enhanced mostly during the first part of germination .

in streptomyces coelicolor, the ecf factor sigr is known to be responsible for regulating thiol-disulfide redox balance  <cit> . the involvement of the sigr regulon in protein quality control is documented by the decreased ability of sigr mutants to resolubilize protein aggregates. interestingly, both the expression of sigr and its anti-sigma factor rsra was enhanced  <dig> fold during the same t2-t <dig> period. the activation of the sigr regulon was represented here by members of the protein degradation pathway, ribosome compounds and chaperones, which were activated at the same t2-t <dig> interval. this suggests that, although expressed, rsra does not trap sigr at the t2-t <dig> period. since rsra releases sigr under thiol-oxidative stress conditions  <cit> , we may speculate that the initial phase of germination, being a transition from a dormant to a metabolically active state under aerobic conditions, generates oxidative stress. following its induction at t2-t <dig>  the expression of sigr was diminished at t6-t <dig> .

sigq
the absolutely highest increase  in the t2-t <dig> time interval was that of sco <dig>  whose mrna was already abundant in dormant spores . its expression was temporarily diminished  in the rehydration period . the sco <dig> encodes a putative sigma factor, sigq that is located upstream of the afsq1-q <dig> system. sigq is known to antagonize the ability of the afsq1-q <dig> system to stimulate antibiotic production  <cit> . the hyperinduction of sigq observed in the present study may thus suggest the sigq-mediated negative control of the pathway-specific activator genes actii-orf <dig>  redd, and cdar during germination and early vegetative growth.

sigh
sigh showed similar pattern of expression as sigq. its expression was also diminished fivefold at t1-t <dig>  compared with its level in dormant spores, and then reactivated in the t2-t <dig> interval . afterwards, its expression did not change significantly until the end of germination. sigh was suggested to control both the septation of aerial hyphae and, as sigr, the osmotic stress response . the osmotic stress response is possibly achieved in cooperation with the anti-anti-sigma factor bldg  <cit> . the bldg mrna was highly abundant in dormant spores and as well as sigh, its level decreased in t1-t <dig> interval  and remained constant until the end. on contrary, the re-activation of sigh expression in t2-t <dig> suggests that its regulon is not only expressed during sporulation but also in germination, when massive water entry likely generates osmotic stress.

later activated sigma factors
expression of the other sigma factors in later periods was not as high as in the first 30 minutes, with only one or two sigma factors activated at each time interval . the expression of sigj  and sco <dig> was diminished at t7-t <dig>  prior to their activation at t9-t <dig>  no other genes from the group of late-induced sigma factors were significantly down regulated during germination. the ecf factor sigj is thought to be a member of the streptomycete osmotic sensory system  <cit> , as other sigma factors   <cit> . in the t6-t <dig> period, two sigma factors from the osmotic sensory group, sigb and sigi, were activated, indicating their possible role in the subsequent activation of metabolic pathways at t7-t <dig>  in addition to responses to both osmotic and oxidative stresses, the sigb regulon also contains other sigma factors, oxidative defense proteins, and chaperones that play a role in cell differentiation  <cit> . since the expression of only a few sigma factors was down regulated during the period preceding t7-t <dig>  the steady state level of expression of the others  might control the metabolic processes occurring at t7-t <dig> 

sigma factors summary
the sigma factors exhibited a different trend in comparison with the metabolic pathway genes. whereas most the metabolic pathways were activated between 0–30 minutes  of growth and again between 150– <dig> minutes , the sigma factors were already up regulated at the beginning of growth  and, as with the metabolic genes, in the 0– <dig> minutes interval . these data correlates with their regulatory role in subsequent gene expression. reactivation after 150– <dig> minutes , which was noticed for genes of the metabolic pathway, did not occur for most sigma factors.

sigma factors of the extracytoplasmic function family  regulate the expression of genes associated with the ability to respond to environmental changes. streptomycetes ecf sigma factors are known to respond to various stresses to which soil dwelling bacteria are naturally exposed. however, our expression data show that these factors are physiologically activated during developmental processes such as germination. also other similarities could be found between germination and stress conditions. the conditions that prompt a spore to germinate involve heat shock , osmotic as well as oxidative/disulfide stresses. activation of sigr, sigh and lits signals oxidative stress as that of sigb, sigh, sigi, sigj signals osmotic stress. protein quality control is under the control of sigr and possibly sco <dig>  cell wall damage responses are also activated during germination since this process requires the massive reconstruction of the cell envelope. the sigma factors responsible for cell wall reconstruction are sige and possibly sco <dig>  which is homologous to sigw of bacillus.

CONCLUSIONS
differential expression analyses have provided a new view of the germination of streptomycete spores. as shown here, dormant spores carry not only dna itself but also an ample transcriptome. considering the minimal metabolic activity of dormant spores, most of mrnas required for the initial phases of germination must be supplied during sporulation. after rehydration of the spore, mrnas are being degraded in the t1-t <dig> period and the synthesis of mrnas is delayed. the decreased stability of rna molecules could also be partially caused by the increased temperature  during the initial 10 min of cultivation, which led to the synchronous spore activation  <cit> .

alternatively, active intracellular rnases might be involved in the initial degradation of mrnas. in contrast, the expression of a small portion of genes is maximally activated at this stage, including several components of lipid metabolism  and the membrane transport pathways.

those mrnas that are required for further development are re-synthesized mostly during the subsequent t2-t <dig> period or later. this increases the need for elements of the transcriptional apparatus in t2-t <dig>  whose own mrna/rrna/trna pool seems to have escaped the initial rna degradation, thus making it an exception. the transcription and translation apparatus is activated continuously throughout the two initial periods t1-t <dig> 

most of the metabolic pathways remained active at a basal level throughout the first 150 min of growth, when next burst of metabolic activity in t7-t <dig> occurred. we believe that this burst is necessary to initiate the first round of dna replication. after the period of 150–180 min , the activity of most of the pathways remained constant until the end of the measured period . our study demonstrated that germination requires the concerted action of a number of sigma factors, whose expression is also activated from the beginning: the putative sigma factors sco <dig> , sco <dig> , and lits at t1-t <dig> and the activation of hrdd and the known ecf family sigma factors sigr, sige, sigd and sigh in the t2-t <dig> period. however, the highest activation at this stage belonged to sigq , whose function in germination is unknown. sigr, and most likely sco <dig>  ensure quality control in the re-folding of proteins that aggregated in dormancy and are required during germination. sige, and most likely sco <dig>  control cell wall integrity, possibly because a massive reconstruction of the cell envelope is needed after the developmentally regulated destruction of the spore coat by the cell wall hydrolases. based on the induction of other sigma factors, most of which are known to respond to various stresses, we suggest that germination evokes stress-like responses as a consequence of the disruption of the internal steady conditions of the spore, which leads to an influx of water, oxygen , salts, and even light, as reflected in lits expression.
