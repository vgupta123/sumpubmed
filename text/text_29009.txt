BACKGROUND
retroposition, an rna-intermediated copy mechanism, could shape genomes widely in eukaryotes, and in particular plays a substantial role in evolution of functional novelties  <cit> . people ever viewed it as a trivial molecular process for making functionless processed pseudogenes  <cit> . however, extensive analyses have revealed that a large number of retrosequences have acquired various functions from vertebrates to invertebrates  <cit> , from spermatogenesis  <cit>  to courtship behaviors  <cit> . many retrogenes could recruit nearby preexisting exon-intron sequences and genomic regions to form a chimeric gene structure with novel protein structures, which may expand protein functional diversity  <cit> .

almost all observed retroposition events involve a single parental gene that serves as substrate for retroposition. however, akiva et al recently observed an extraordinary case that two adjacent genes in the hominoid lineage, pip5k1a and psmd <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  co-retroposed from a read-through transcript and formed a new chimeric gene, pipsl, in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . pip5k1a encodes the alpha isoform of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type i , which is involved in the synthesis of two essential second messengers,  <dig> -diacylglycerol and inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  <cit> . on the other hand, psmd <dig> recruits ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome for their degradation, which is mediated by two conserved 20- <dig> residual hydrophobic regions, i.e., ubiquitin-interacting motifs   <cit> .

northern analyses revealed high expression of pipsl in testis in humans and chimpanzee and base-level or undetectable expression in other tissues  <cit> . the human pipsl possesses a  <dig> bp in-frame deletion at + <dig> bp with respect to the start codon, which is fixed in human populations. such a deletion causes an early frameshift with disrupted translation such that western blotting does not reveal protein product in human. however, western blotting also fails to detect proteins in chimpanzee which does not have such a deletion. therefore, pipsl was believed to undergo translational silencing in both species  <cit> . comparison of the substitution rates between synonymous and nonsynonymous rates revealed that the c-terminal portion of pipsl derived from psmd <dig> possibly undergoes positive selection in the early stage of the hominoid clade while the pip5k1a-derived portion of the n-terminal portion in later stage of the hominoid clade does not depart from neutral expectation  <cit> . the authors even propose pipsl might be detrimental in human population now.

these analyses provided valuable data to understand the origination process and the characteristics of pipsl. moreover, this extraordinary gene raised two interesting questions for further pursuit. first, considering no protein product is detected, is pipsl a functional protein-coding gene or it is a processed pseudogene that has never had or has lost its function in human? second, there were only two species of hominoid species, i.e., human and chimp in the analysis. such limited dataset renders it hard to differentiate between the following two scenarios: positive selection indeed occurred on evolutionary branches toward human/chimp; positive selection occurs on branches leading to other hominoids, e.g., orangutan and gibbon and thus signal observed by comparing human pipsl and its two parental genes is a by-product. if the later case is true, it will be reasonable to expect the repressed translation in both human and chimp since pipsl might be only functional in orangutan and gibbon rather than human and chimp.

we tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary signature relating to the coding potential of pipsl in both within-species variation and between species divergence. such a strategy, complementary to the biological analyses of babushock et al.  and akiva et al. , revealed that the present-day pipsl is subject to significant evolutionary constraint that shapes the standing variation in natural populations of the functional protein coding gene in humans and maintains its open reading frame . more than that, comparative analysis reveals that the adaptive evolution occurred in the lineage toward human and chimpanzee. finally, genome-wide analysis of retro-pseudogenes suggests testis-specific transcription of pipsl is not due to transcriptional leakage but highly regulated by tissue-dependent methylation. these analyses, in conjunction of previous expression data at rna level, suggest that pipsl is a functional retro-fusion testis-specific gene. thus, the extraordinary co-retroposition mechanism played a role in the evolution of the male-specific functions in the lineage toward the humans.

RESULTS
the lower nucleotide polymorphism and high structural integrity suggest pipsl has coding potential
 cds has a lower polymorphism level
the summary statistics for the population genetics of pipsl are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig> . first, our polymorphism data suggests 5' utr and 3' utr might undergo different selection force. table  <dig> shows the high constraint of 5' flanking region with a nucleotide diversity  of  <dig> × 10- <dig>  which might correspond to a functional role. consistently, the published chip-chip experiment of the ludwig institute  <cit>  shows this small region is highly enriched with transcription factor binding sites .

moreover, as expected, cds has fewer polymorphisms in terms of π of  <dig> × 10- <dig> compared to the genome-wide background,  <dig> × 10- <dig> <cit> . it also has lower polymorphism level in terms of snps and indels compared to 3' flanking region. in terms of selection coefficient, θ, it is three fold lower in that there are  <dig> snps across  <dig> bp 3' flanking region, while there are only nine snps across  <dig>  bp cds. we tested whether or not this difference departs from neutral assumptions using hudson's formula  <cit> . in this case, l, n and s are  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as a result, the polymorphism level of cds is significantly lower compared to 3' utr if the whole locus is homogeneously neutral .

a. "complete" indicates the full locus of pipsl, which consists of  <dig> bp 5' flanking region,  <dig>  bp pip5k1a-derived cds,  <dig>  bp psmd4-derived cds and  <dig> bp 3' flanking region. 5' flanking region includes both  <dig> bp promoter and  <dig> bp 5' utr, while 3' flanking region indicates 3' utr.

b. θ is the selection coefficient or 4neμ .

c. this unique indel is heterozygous.

d. indel diversity is calculated using the most conservative way, i.e., we only count diallelic difference and regard the copy number variants in 3' utr as only two alleles. thus, the indel diversity of 3' utr might be underestimated.

however, can this result be accounted for by a difference in local mutation bias, e.g., 3' utr has a higher mutation rate? if so, we expect that 3' utr would have a higher between-species divergence as well. however, we only observed nine substitutions in 3' utr compared to  <dig> substitutions in cds . by comparing polymorphism and divergence, hka test shows cds significantly departs from 3' utr  with possible excess of substitutions in 3'utr or the decrease of substitutions in cds. in order to disentangle both possibilities, we surveyed the polymorphism data of the pipsl locus in gibbon. according to the trace data, this locus seems pseudogenic, which could serve as a neutral background. out of two chromosomes from one female gibbon, nine segregating sites were identified, three derived from 3'utr and six derived from cds. given selection coefficient, θ, the expected number of segregating sites, s, follows this formula  <cit> :

  

where "n" is  <dig> and  <dig> for our case and the gibbon genome sequence, respectively. in other words, if we increase the sample size of gibbon sequences to  <dig>  the expected number of segregating sites in 3' utr and cds should be about  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it is notable this iterative formula usually require multiple alleles like six or even more. therefore, the estimation of  <dig> or  <dig> might not be that accurate. however, such a small sample does show cds might have more polymorphisms than that of 3' utr in gibbon pipsl locus. therefore, considering the observed data in human,  <dig> substitutions in 3'utr and  <dig> substitutions in cds, the deviation of human polymorphism data from the neutral expectation should be more likely attributed to the increasing constraint in cds region.

 both polymorphism data and evolutionary simulation suggests maintenance of pipsl's orf is not a by-chance event
the polymorphism data of table  <dig> also show that cds appears to avoid indels compared to both flanking regions. specifically, there are five homozygous indels and two heterozygous indels across  <dig>  kb flanking regions; by contrast, there is only one heterozygous indel across  <dig>  bp coding region . regarding indel diversity, it is an order-of-multitude larger in utr  than in cds . based on hudson's formula  <cit> , the probability to observe only one indel in an cds of  <dig>  bp is only  <dig>  if cds has as identical indel coefficient as that of utr.

using between-species data and by performing forward-simulation from the ancient sequence of pipsl in hominoid, we further tested how it might be possible to maintain one orf of  <dig>  bp. specifically, taking advantage of ncbi trace data, we assembled the complete pipsl locus in orangutan and gibbon given the high read coverage  around this locus. by contrast, we were only able to assemble pip5k1a-derived region in gorilla due to its lower sequencing coverage in psmd4-derived region. like human and chimp, orangutan maintains its pipsl orf. however, the gibbon pipsl lost its coding potential by accumulating three nonsense substitutions and one in-frame indel . gorilla seems to lie in a similar case with one nonsense substitution  in the middle of pip5k1a-derived region.

we implemented reevolver  <cit>  and forward simulated emergences of nonsense substitutions or frame-shifting indels together with nonsynonymous mutations. as a result, two tests of reevolver support the functionality of pipsl . specifically, in the case of the complete sequence, pipsl demonstrates high constraint revealed by both small na/ns  ratio  and frame-disrupting features   compared to the expectation under neutrality. furthermore, if we analyze psmd4-derived region and pip5k1a-derived region separately, both of them are also constrained as shown by highly significant pdis. as complementary evidence, we also investigated the process by estimating the time necessary to disrupt pipsl's orf  <cit> . the time is only  <dig>  million years and thus the probability to maintain this orf is  <dig> × 10- <dig> , which again suggests its protein-level constraint.

a. we used two distinct methods to reconstruct the ancestral sequence, paml and dnapars of phylip package . in all cases, there results are similar between each other.

b. pnans is defined as the proportion of simulated datasets that show a na/ns ratio smaller or equal to the observation. here, na and ns indicates the number of nonsynonymous mutations and that of synonymous mutations, respetively.

c. pdis corresponds to the percentage of simulated datasets that demonstrates a number of frame-disrupting mutations  smaller or equal to the observed number. out of all lineages of interest, human, chimp, orangutan and gibbon, only three stop codons and one indel are observed and those only in the gibbon genome. specifically, two nonsense substitutions occur in the pip5k1a-derived region, while the other one nonsense substitution and one indel situate in the psmd4-derived region.

positive selection of psmd4-derived region only leads to human/chimpanze lineage
the above analysis reveals that natural selection maintained a long orf from the split of human and gibbon at  <dig> million years ago . taking advantage of recently available sequence data of gibbon, orangutan and gorilla, we investigated this process with higher resolution. we used codeml of paml package  <cit>  to infer the background selection force .

 heterogeneous selection in different species
pipsl shows a remarkably heterogeneous evolutionary pattern when comparing both the pip5k1a-derived and psmd4-derived sequences, and when comparing different species . specifically, the pip5k1a-derived region did not show ka/ks significantly different from  <dig> for any branch except there is an excess of synonymous mutations in orangutan . on the other hand, branch-model of codeml shows heterogeneity of ka/ks in the psmd4-derived region. a parameter-rich model with internal branches and external branches that has two sets of ka/ks fits the data better than a one ka/ks model . regarding individual species, the psmd4-derived region seems to show negative selection with ka/ks of  <dig>  in orangutan although the test is not significant . by contrast, it showed a strong signature of adaptive evolution especially prior to the speciation of human and chimp, where  <dig>  nonsynonymous substitutions occurred without any synonymous substitutions . if we pool all three ancestral branches leading to human/chimp together, the lrt is still significant with ka/ks of  <dig>  and p of  <dig> , which suggests a long term adaptation of psmd4-derived regions in the ancestors of human and chimp.

n, a and c are short for "failure to reject neutral null model", "adaptive" and "constrained", respectively. selection force for psmd4-derived region of gorilla is still unknown given the lack of trace data.

 site-specific positive selection
based on the branch-site model of codeml, we inferred psmd4-derived region consists of seven nonsynonymous mutations that occurred before the split of human and chimp inferred. four out of them happened around the second ubiquitin-interaction motif   <cit> , r->h , a->v , y->c  and q->l  . moreover, strongly supports all these substitutions are driven by adaptive evolution. all of them have a bayes empirical bayes  probability greater than  <dig> , which measures whether the ka/ks is larger than one for this local region. out of them, y->c and q->l even have a beb value larger than  <dig> . these sites are also supported by hyphy . the key residue ala and ser are unchanged, which ensures that uim- <dig> still maintains its ubiquitin-interaction capability to some extent.

by contrast, the parental protein psmd <dig> is nearly unchanged across 70~ <dig> million years' mammalian evolution : there is only one nonsynonymous substitution between primate and dog. inspection of all available vertebrate lineage sequences shows that psmd <dig> was always under strong purifying selection, except prior to the split of birds and mammalian .

testis-enriched transcription of pipsl is tightly-regulated by tissue-differential methylation
 testing the hypothesis of permissive testis expression
testis may provide a transciptionally permissive environment  <cit> , which implies transcription leakage tends to occur in testis more frequently than other tissues. from this prospective, pseudogenes could be more likely expressed in testis. therefore, testis-specific transcription is not necessarily a signature of functionality. in order to test this possibility, we performed genome-wide profiling of all retroposed pseudogenes in human. in brief, we integrated and improved upon previous strategies  <cit>  to identify retroposed copies . out of  <dig>  rpcs, we generated a highly reliable dataset of  <dig> retropseudogenes and a less stringent dataset of  <dig>  retropseudogenes .

according to chromosomal coordinates and strands, we cross-referenced this updated retropseudogene dataset with the exon-array based expression data from ucsc genome browser. herein, ucsc presents the exon-array data as log-ratios with positive values and negative values indicating above-median expression and below-median expression, respectively. we found human testis is not permissive for retropseudogene transcription. as shown in table  <dig>  no tissues show a remarkable difference in expression of retropseudogenes. testis expression of retropseudogenes is even slightly lower than many other tissues.

a. expression value calculated is a log value, which might be smaller than  <dig> . this column shows the median expression of all pseudogenes in the tissue of interest.

b. this column counts the number of pseudogenes which has the highest expression in the tissue of interest no matter how much this highest expression should be.

c. this column is similar to the previous column except the highest expression for a pseudogenes should be above the criterion of  <dig> . this value indicates a presence of expression by manually checking the correlation between est data and exon-array data on ucsc genome browser.

in addition, the exon-array data confirmed the abundant expression of pipsl in testis, consistent with previous results from northern profiling experiments in testis, liver, lung and many other tissues  <cit> . the abundance of pipsl amounted to  <dig>  in testis as revealed by both independent probesets, while pipsl abundance was lower than  <dig>  for all other tissues, indicating trace level transcription. for all  <dig> pseudogenes with exon array data,  <dig>  are transcribed in testis above the cutoff of  <dig> . however, only six out of them  reaches as high abundance as  <dig>  in testis. moreover, all of these six pseudogenes are also transcribed in some other tissues with the abundance above  <dig> . thus, abundant and specific transcription of pipsl establishes it as a clear outlier compared to retropseudogenes.

 detecting methylation of pipsl
if testis-specific transcription of pipsl has functional significance, how is this tissue-specificity achieved? weber and his colleagues generated genome-wide methylation data presented as methylation log <dig> ratios of bound over input signals and they also proposed the value of  <dig>  as a cutoff to differentiate hypermethylation from hypomethylation  <cit> . as a result, they found germline-specific genes preferentially undergo de novo methylation. specifically, genes that are not methylated in sperm are more likely to get methylated in somatic cells and transcriptionally repressed. remarkably, pipsl is consistent with this pattern in that it is hypermethylated in primary lung fibroblast cells with the log value of  <dig>  and hypomethylated in sperm with the log value of - <dig> .

for the aforementioned  <dig> retropseudogenes, only three of them are covered by weber et al's data and none of them displays such a de novo methylation pattern. notably, regarding the larger dataset of  <dig>  pseudogenes, for which  <dig> entries are included in weber et al's set, only ten  show a strong de novo methylation in somatic cells as pipsl does. considering this dataset might include some functional retrogenes, the percentage of real pseudogenes possessing de novo methylation might be smaller than 5%. again, this analysis suggests that pipsl is an intriguing outlier in that pipsl's transcription profile is highly regulated rather than transcriptionally leaky. that means testis-specific expression could be a functional signature for pipsl.

discussion
babushok et al. suggests that the indel around the original start codon disrupts the coding potential of pipsl locus in human. however, our population genetics analysis shows the downstream  <dig>  bp orf is more constrained than the flanking regions in terms of frequency of snp or indels. specially, lack of indels in cds in the current human population not only suggests pipsl's coding potential, but also indicates that human pipsl is still under purifying selection rather than relaxation, as proposed by babushok et al. secondly, our forward simulation shows it is highly unlikely that a neutral segment of such a length would remain over  <dig> million years. as shown by the pipsl locus in gibbon, there are up to three nonsense substitutions and one in-frame indel scatters across the whole region. thirdly, positive selection always occurred in the internal branches leading to human and chimp, which reveals continuing gain of function for a long time rather than limited to the hominoid ancestor. all these three lines of evidence suggest human pipsl is a bona-fide protein-coding gene. protein translation might be finely tuned and limited to specific time point, producing a small quantity of protein, as in a special stage of spermatogenesis or during sperm-egg interaction. thus, pipsl escapes detection of western blotting in whole testis lysates.

the aforementioned comparative analysis also indicates lineage specific evolution after origination of the pipsl locus. different hominoid species might face different environmental changes, which affect fitness of the same gene, for example, pipsl. an alternative interesting reason might be the difference of the long term effective population size . all branches from the divergence of orangutan and human/chimp/gorilla groups have an estimation of ne which ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>    <cit> . organisms with a large ne are selectively efficient: those slightly advantageous alleles would be more likely to be fixed and those slightly deleterious mutations would be more likely to be removed  <cit> . by contrast, in organisms with a small ne, slightly beneficial mutations have high chance to get lost and slightly deleterious mutations have high chance to get fixed. from this point of view, pipsl has a small fitness advantage, which is more likely to get fixed or maintained in orangutan or ancestral branches. in contrast, it might be lost in gorilla with a smaller ne. herein, positive selection might occur before the split of gorilla and human/chimp since they share the majority of their evolutionary history. thus, two independent losses of the open reading frame occurred in both gorilla and gibbon. it is notable such parallel loss is not that unlikely for new genes. for example, an x-linked testes chimeric gene, hun, was created about 2~ <dig> million years ago, prior to the the split of d. simulans, d. sechellia, and d. mauritiana  <cit> . however, hun maintains a integral open reading frame only in d. simulans, while its suffers from different frame-distrupting mutations in both d. sechellia and d. mauritiana.

as revealed by the lower number of snps and indels in human, adaptive selection in the chimp/human ancestral branch  might increase the fitness of pipsl to an extent such that it could be maintained in the current population under selective constraint.

selection drives the remarkable change of uim- <dig> on the evolutionary branch leading to human and chimp. considering uim- <dig> while not uim- <dig> is the preferred ubiquitin binding partner, maintenance of the essential key residues ala and ser in uim- <dig> explains why pipsl still can bind ubiquitin, although its capability does decrease relative to psmd <dig>  <cit> . uim- <dig> is also known to be responsible to bind ubiquitin receptors  <cit> . the remarkable adaptive changes in the ancestor of human and chimp might contribute to the change of interaction partner of pipsl. since the parental gene psmd <dig> undergoes strong purifying selection during hundreds of millions of years of evolution, pipsl could be an interesting target for further comparative functional study.

finally, it is interesting to ask how many retroposed fused genes the genome encodes considering the prevalence of transcription-mediated gene fusion event  <cit> . we compared ensembl gene annotation and retroposed copies we identified, and found pipsl is the unique case in the human genome. analogously, we do not find any case in rhesus monkey, rat, dog, cow, opossum, platypus and fruitfly. in mouse, we found another case that transcripts of 6030436e02rik and c330019g07rik together with  <dig> kb intergenic region fused first and retroposed to chromosome  <dig> . the fused locus has been pseudogenized with seven frame shifts and four nonsense mutations or six frame shifts and two nonsense mutations scattered in the 6030436e02rik-derived region and c330019g07rik-derived region, respectively. its non-functionality is also supported by the lack of transcription evidence like est or mrna. extremely low abundance of retroposed, fused genes across numerous animals suggests the inefficiency or complexity of this generation mechanism itself. first, as akiva et al.  <cit>  shows, most transcription-mediated events are rare or confined to certain tissues. in other words, they might not be expressed in the germ line. second, the mouse case suggests that the fusion might not be able to generate a continuous orf with intervention of noncoding regions. akiva also shows only 25% cases can generate a fused orf. finally, such locus might not get fixed in the genome considering it interrupts the original dosage balance for multiple genes. in addition to these issues, it is also not clear how retroposed fused copies can insert into an appropriate genomic context to become transciptionally active.

CONCLUSIONS
thus, pipsl represents an extraordinary case in which natural selection has increased the genetic novelty via a complicated mechanism in primates.
