BACKGROUND
chip-seq  coupling with dna sequencing) is widely used to precisely map the location of transcription factor  binding or histone modification sites at a genome-wide scale  <cit> . other related sequencing-based techniques dnase-seq  <cit> , faire-seq  <cit>  are often used to define the open chromatin regions and identify accessible regulatory regions. many computational programs  <cit>  have been developed to identify enriched regions  for the chip-seq data. however, a majority of these programs were developed for a single chip-seq sample data. given that many biological questions are often asked to compare the enriched regions under two different conditions, such as before and after using drugs, with and without chemical or hormone treatment, binding patterns of different transcription factors, or one transcription factor binding information in two cell types, it is critical to develop new programs to meet this need and to quantitatively compare two biological chip-seq samples. in our recent study  <cit> , we found following tgfβ stimulation of the a <dig> epithelial ovarian cancer cell line, chip-seq identified smad <dig> binding loci were classified into four distinct binding patterns: 1) basal; 2) shifted; 3) stimulated only; 4) unstimulated only, indicating that tgfβ stimulation alters smad <dig> binding patterns in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. however, the binding patterns were measured on a qualitative basis. therefore, it is essential to develop a quantitative method to address this increasingly generalized biological question.

a study from xu et al  <cit>  employed a hidden markov model  to identify the differential binding enrichments from two chip-seq samples , which was tested on three histone modifications data in two different cell types. however, the chipdiff program suffers from some shortcomings. firstly, the hmm-based algorithm itself cannot distinguish whether those identified differential enriched regions are indeed significantly enriched or not. this is because in many cases a more enriched region in sample a comparing to sample b isn't necessarily an enriched region in sample a itself and vice versa. therefore, the program tends to detect many false positive modification sites. secondly, this program directly uses the samples' sequencing reads to perform the comparison without considering the information in the control experiment of each sample. however, as noted by zhang et al.  <cit> , the control sample is critical for modeling the sequencing and mapping biases. thirdly, it is questionable whether this program is suitable for narrow peaks comparison since the program sets the bin size at least  <dig> kb. for example, the peak width for a typical tf binding site is around 300- <dig> bp. fourthly, it fails to define a binding pattern for each identified differential binding site after comparing two samples. a few other studies have made the same efforts to develop programs, dbchip  <cit> , dime  <cit> , to detect differential binding sites in two samples, but these programs suffer from the same drawbacks either lacking distinguishing binding patterns or neglecting the normalization between samples.

in this study, we developed a novel quantitative method for comparing two biological chip-seq samples, called qchipat, not only to detect the differential binding sites but also to classify them into distinct binding patterns. our method employs a new global normalization method   <cit> , utilizes pre-defined enriched regions identified from single-sample enriched regions identification programs, uses statistical methods to define differential enriched regions, then defines binding pattern information for those differential enriched regions. our program was tested on a benchmark data, histone modifications data  <cit>  used by chipdiffs  <cit> . it was then applied on two study cases: one to identify differential histone modification sites for chip-seq of h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> data in akt1-transfected mcf10a cells; the other to identify differential binding sites for chip-seq of tcf7l <dig> data in mcf <dig> and panc <dig> cells.

RESULTS
evaluation of qchipat with benchmark data
a benchmark testing data, the chip-seq of histone modification data from mikkelsen et al  <cit> , including h3k27me <dig> , h3k4me <dig>  and h3k36me <dig> , was used for evaluating our program. the reason for choosing this data for the evaluation is the following: 1) it was used by chipdiff  <cit>  and is easily compared to our program; and 2) differential histone modification sites have been validated in the same study  <cit> . a summary of the results for comparing different methods are shown in table  <dig>  we found that compared with chipdiff, qchipat identified fewer differential histone modification sites . two possible reasons may account for this: 1) the peak calling program belt used in qchipat identified a more stringent set of initial enriched regions compared with the one in chipdiff; and 2) the wilcoxon rank test used in qchipat removed less significantly different enriched regions. in order to minimize the bias from peak calling programs, other programs macs  <cit>  and findpeaks  <cit>  were also used for a comparison . both programs identified even fewer dhmss than belt did. in addition, belt was able to detect more dhmss with "only" patterns and "shift" patterns compared with macs and findpeaks.

comparison of different normalization methods
chip-seq samples performed in different conditions and time usually have different numbers of raw sequencing reads due to the number of sequencing lanes conducted for each sample  and multiple-matched or non-matched matched reads in the sample. before comparing two samples, it is necessary to normalize the read counts to eliminate system errors and minimize sequencing depth difference between two samples. in our program, we employed three normalization methods including linear normalization, nonparametric empirical bayes correction normalization and quantile normalization, which are based on different assumptions of the data distribution. a comparative summary of the three different normalization methods is shown in table  <dig>  the results of the method without using any normalization methods were also reported. the results of chipdiff were used as a baseline to gauge the performance of each different normalization method. for each method, the percentage of dhmss overlapping with chipdiff results is shown in parentheses. the results showed that the dhmss identified by quantile and neb normalization methods highly overlap with those predicted by chipdiff, while the linear normalization method and non-normalization method have fewer overlapping dhmss with chipdiff. for all the three data, the overlapping percentage between quantile and chipdiff is the highest one among all the three normalization methods in esc, while neb method achieves the highest overlapping percentage in npc. furthermore, the neb method identifies more dhmss than the quantile method in esc and a similar number of dhmss as that of the quantile method in npc. therefore, the overall performance of the neb is better than that of other normalization methods on the three data. the results are not surprising since neb normalization has two advantages compared with other normalization methods. firstly, neb estimates the proportion of the reads as p0=n1/s, where n <dig> is the frequency of the read with count  <dig> and s is the sequencing depth of the chip-seq data. secondly, neb adjusts read counts based on both the observed read counts and the nature of the frequency distribution of the read counts.

optimization of the neb-based method
in order to further optimize the neb-based method, we tested the bin size parameter used in wilcoxon rank test in our qchipat program, to determine how this parameter would affect the number of the enriched regions and the types of binding patterns identified by our program. to optimize bin size and determine how its variance would affect the results, we first tested a range of different bin sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for each bin, in which each enriched region was divided into equal length bins . we found that the number of dhmss for each sample didn't significantly change with different bin size tested  when the neb normalization method was used. however, when the bin size is higher than  <dig> bp, the number of identified dhmss is very similar, suggesting that the optimal bin size for the neb method may be between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the binding pattern results show the same trend. the number of differential binding patterns remained stable when the bin size is higher than  <dig> bp .

application to k <dig> and k <dig> datasets
to further test the performance and efficiency of qchipat, we applied it to a study case, chip-seq of h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> in akt1-tranfected mcf10a vs vehicle control, conducted in our laboratory. many studies have shown that among many types of histone modifications, h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  two repressive marks are critical for normal and aberrant differentiation of stem and progenitor cells  <cit>  as well as in the development of cancers  <cit> . our previous study also demonstrated that epigenetic silencing of a set of akt1-mediated genes  <cit> . akt <dig> kinase is a key downstream effector of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  signaling pathway that regulates diverse cellular functions, including growth, proliferation, survival, metabolism, motility, angiogenesis, and vesicle trafficking  <cit> . therefore, it is important to determine akt1-mediated genome-wide histone modification patterns for h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> and its subsequent influence on downstream target genes. we chose the neb normalization method since it performed best on the benchmark data h3k27me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> compared to other three methods .

we have identified a total of  <dig>  dhmss for h3k27me <dig> in akt1-transfected mcf10a cells. of these, a majority of them  were classified into "only" or "shift" binding patterns for akt1-tranfected mcf10a cells. for h3k9me <dig> mark, of  <dig>  dhmss in akt1-transfected mcf10a cells,  <dig> % were either "only" or "shift" binding patterns . the detailed information of the dhmss is in additional file  <dig>   <dig>  our results suggests that akt <dig> signalling may trigger the switching of h3k27me <dig> or h3k9me <dig> modification sites, i.e. modifying different sets of nucleosomes on the genome, resulting in marking a totally different set of target genes in the case of "only" binding. we further correlated the genes with dhmss with a set of  <dig>  akt1-mediated differentially expressed genes in mcf10a cells, found that  <dig> genes have at least one dhms for h3k27me <dig> or h3k9me <dig> marks . interestingly, we found that the dhmss for h3k27me <dig> generally showed higher enrichment than those of h3k9me <dig>  however, there was no significant difference in dhmss' enrichments for akt1-mediated up- or down-regulated genes. we further performed go analysis on the sets of genes enriched for both h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> marks . we defined two kinds of enriched genes: positive and negative enriched genes. positive enriched genes are genes that are more enriched with either of two histone marks compared to the vehicle control ; while negative enriched genes less enriched with neither marks than the vehicle control . interestingly, the positive genes that are enriched in both the histone marks are highly enriched in the categories of tissue specific cellular functions, such as endocrine system disorders, gastrointestinal disease . in contrast, the common negative enriched genes which lack these two histone marks are more enriched in cancer related genes . the function of both groups of genes are epigenetically silenced by the presence of these histone modifications, while cancer related genes might be activated due to the loss of the epigenetic effect, which is consistent with the stem cell-like characteristics of tumour cells  <cit> . next, we wanted to examine if there is functional difference between these two sets of genes that are marked by the two different histone modifications. not surprisingly, genes which are positive with either mark in the akt1-transfected cells show more tissue specificity. however, genes lacking h3k27me <dig> in akt1-transfected cells are realted to cell death whereas the genes without h3k9me <dig> are more enriched in cancer genes.

application to tcf7l <dig> in mcf <dig> and panc <dig> cells
in order to evaluate the performance of qchipat on a particular transcription factor, we further tested qchipat on chip-seq of the tcf7l <dig> in mcf <dig> and panc <dig> cells. using a set of parameters in which a bin size was  <dig> bp, p-value was less than  <dig> , ratio was  <dig> , difference was  <dig> , belt threshold was  <dig>  for tcf7l <dig> in mcf <dig>  and belt threshold was  <dig>  for tcf7l <dig> in panc <dig>  qchipat identified  <dig>  "mcf <dig> only,"  <dig> "mcf <dig> shift,"  <dig>  "mcf <dig> unchanged,"  <dig>  "panc <dig> only,"  <dig> "panc <dig> shift," and  <dig>  "panc <dig> unchanged" binding sites. screenshots of examples for each type of binding pattern are shown in figure 3a. we then examined the accuracy by correlating those "only" binding pattern with their associated genes' expression levels. as expected, we found that genes associated tcf7l <dig> "mcf <dig> only" have higher expression values in mcf <dig> cells than in panc <dig> cells while genes associated tcf7l <dig> "panc <dig> only" have higher expression values in panc <dig> cells than in mcf <dig> cells . this result strongly demonstrated the accuracy of qchipat.

we next performed ipa analysis on genes associated with mcf <dig> and panc <dig> "only" tcf7l <dig> binding sites . interestingly, we found that the genes associated with "mcf <dig> only" binding sites differed significantly from the genes associated with "panc <dig> only" binding sites in terms of the three ipa categories of network functions, physiological system development and function, and canonical pathways. for all three gene expression categories, only cancer and post-translational modification  showed up for both cases of genes. this functional difference between genes associated with "mcf <dig> only" tcf7l <dig> binding sites compared to genes associated with "panc <dig> only" tcf7l <dig> binding sites is expected, because the genes are differentially regulated by definition of the "only" binding pattern: genes associated with "only" differential enriched regions  in one sample are not associated with any differential enriched regions in the other sample, therefore, the significant difference in function of the two groups of genes supports the accuracy of qchipat's "only" pattern detection.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a quantitative method, qchipat, to identify distinct binding patterns for two biological chip-seq samples, and the program is implemented in r, perl and c++, and run in linux system. using a benchmarking test data, histone modifications data  <cit> , we compared the performance of three different normalization methods on identification of dhmss, including linear normalization, neb correction normalization and quantile normalization, then compared it with chipdiffs program  <cit> . although each normalization method has its own advantages, we found that neb correction normalization is a more suitable normalization method in our qchipat. two notable advantages of neb correction normalization are: 1) neb estimates the proportion of the reads using the frequency of the read against the sequencing depth, which avoids both underestimating the proportion of highly abundant reads and overestimating the proportion of low and intermediate abundance reads, and 2) neb adjusts read counts based on both the observed read counts and the nature of the frequency distribution of the read counts. this is able to correct abundant reads among high and low regions. therefore, the enriched regions can be correctly identified. in addition, qchipat has implemented a novel feature: categorizing binding  sites into three distinct binding patterns. this novel feature implementation is very important since quantitatively associating each of the differential binding sites with one of two samples is essential to reveal key biological functions. for example, once we identify "only" binding of genes in sample a and sample b, we are able to perform go or other pathway analyses on these genes and may identify some interesting biological functions. this was demonstrated in our two study cases . thus, compared to other similar programs, chipdiffs  <cit> , dbchip  <cit> , and dime  <cit> , qchipat is able to not only identify differential enriched binding regions between two samples but also to further classify these regions into distinct binding patterns associated with each sample.

our qchipat was further tested and validated on two study cases, chip-seq of h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> in akt1-tranfected mcf10a vs. vehicle control, and chip-seq of tcf7l <dig> in mcf <dig> vs. panc <dig> cells, both from our previous studies. interestingly, both h3k37me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> marks showed two major binding patterns "only" or "shift" binding at akt1-tranfected mcf10a cells . although our previous study has shown  <cit>  akt signaling can be a trigger of the epigenetic silencing at many downstream target genes through the cross-talk between dna methylation and h3k27me <dig>  it didn't show the relationship between h3k37me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  nevertheless, it is a little bit surprising that both akt1-mediated up- and down-regulated genes have at least one differential binding site for h3k27me <dig> or h3k9me <dig> marks but there is no significant difference in enrichments since both histone marks are recognized as repressive marks. it is possibly that activated akt signaling may trigger downstream key transcription factors and further dynamically regulate epigenetic processes for the interplay of these two histone modifications. a more thorough underlying mechanism for this epigenetic process needs to be elucidated in an experimental study in the future. the test of qchipat on chip-seq of tcf7l <dig> in mcf <dig> and panc <dig> cells was used to evaluate its accuracy in detecting binding patterns of a particular transcription factor. the correlation between gene expression levels with the detected mcf <dig> and panc <dig> "only" tcf7l <dig> binding sites demonstrated that qchipat is also applicable to compare narrow peaks in two chip-seq samples such as tfs in addition to broad peaks such as repressive histone modifications.

several notable advantages of qchipat include: 1) this software is able to make use of the information in control experiment; 2) this software incorporates a novel global normalization strategy: nonparametric empirical bayes correction normalization; and 3) this software provides the binding pattern information among different enriched regions.

nevertheless, there are several limitations. first, although three binding patterns were presented in this study, another binding pattern that may be interesting is where there is a sharp enriched region in one chip-seq sample, while a broad enriched region in the other chip-seq sample, but the total number of mapped reads are approximately the same. we look forward to deeper investigations on this binding pattern and will consider this pattern in the updated version of qchipat in the future. second, in this study, we only focus on comparing two biological chip-seq samples and identifying their differential binding patterns. another interesting task is to identify differential binding patterns from two groups of chip-seq samples, which requires the comparison of more than two samples. we are studying new mathematical and statistical models for quantitatively identifying binding patterns from two groups of chip-seq samples in future work.
