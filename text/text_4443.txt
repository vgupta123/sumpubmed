BACKGROUND
iron  deficiency is a yield-limiting factor for a variety of field crops all around the world and generally results from the interaction of limited soil fe bioavailability and susceptible genotype cultivation  <cit> . iron is an important microelement for plant life due to its involvement as redox-active metal in photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, nitrogen assimilation, hormone biosynthesis, production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species, osmoprotection and pathogen defence  <cit> .

under aerated conditions at neutral alkaline ph, the soluble fe concentration in soil solution is very low. to cope with fe shortage plants have developed two strategies for its acquisition. the strategy i  relies on improvement of fe uptake through acidification of soil solution by excretion of protons via a plasmalemma p-type atpase resulting in an increased fe solubility, reduction of fe3+ to the more soluble fe2+ by a feiii-chelate reductase and plasmalemma transport of fe2+ by the activity of a fe transporter  <cit> . some model plants used to study strategy i are dicots such as arabidopsis thaliana, solanum lycopersicum and pisum sativum  <cit> .

plant responses to fe deficiency have been recently analyzed on the basis of large-scale changes not only in transcriptome  <cit> , but also in proteome  <cit>  and metabolome  <cit> . results of transcriptome analysis are influenced by differences in experimental plans, plant species and microarray platforms, and thus difficult to compare and be generalized. notwithstanding this drawback, recently, a set of  <dig> transcripts that robustly reflect the transcriptional response of arabidopsis to fe deficiency  <cit> , has been described as the "ferrome" by schmidt and buckhout  <cit> . the "ferrome" consists of a list of transcripts considered to be involved in the basic response to iron deficiency. the ferrome is particularly enriched in genes related to heavy metal cation transport and metal homeostasis. focusing on tomato, a plant often used as a model to study fe deficiency  and a crop of economic importance, no information is available at genome-wide transcriptional level. two proteomic characterizations of tomato roots in response to 1-week of fe deprivation showed  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  differentially expressed protein spots respectively. modifications in proteome suggest changes in energy metabolism, sulfur metabolism, response to oxidative stress and signal transduction.

in the present work a genome-wide transcriptional characterization of tomato roots in response to fe deficiency is presented. this approach allowed indentifying  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts involved in the responses to the nutritional stress. transcriptional changes, mainly related to positive modulation of glycolysis, tca and methionine cycle, suggest that tomato roots behave similarly to arabidopsis under fe deficiency. furthermore, flavonoid biosynthesis and root morphological changes are revealed as specific tomato responses to fe shortage.

RESULTS
responses to fe-deficiency
typical responses of fe-deficiency  <cit>  were observed in tomato plants grown for  <dig> d in the presence of a low amount of fe and thereafter subjected to  <dig> d of fe deprivation. the chlorophyll content  was reduced in fe-deficient plants . a concomitant increase in root feiii-chelate reductase activity  was also observed with values similar to those commonly found in roots of fe-deficient tomato plants  <cit> . furthermore, fe-deprived tomato plants developed more lateral roots and showed an abundant production of root-hairs .

comparison of root gene expression profiles in fe-deficient and fe-sufficient tomato plants
differences in root gene expression between fe-sufficient and fe-deficient tomato plants were obtained by a genome-wide gene expression analysis using a tomato chip developed through combimatrix technology  <cit> . this chip allows monitoring simultaneously the expression of more than  <dig>  tomato transcripts. ninety-seven differentially expressed transcripts between fe-deficient and fe-sufficient tomato roots  were identified by linear models for microarray   <cit>  . this result obtained using a large-scale chip reinforce the idea that plant transcriptional response to fe shortage is based on the modulation of a relative small set of genes as previously observed for the arabidopsis "ferrome"  <cit> .

manually curated annotation of the  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts was based on results of blastp analysis against uniprot  <cit>  database  using terms of biological process of gene ontology   <cit> . sequence grouping in functional categories according to the go terms revealed that the most abundant functional category was "metabolic process" both for up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts . other up-regulated transcripts belonged to "establishment of localization"  and "cell wall organization and biogenesis" , while for the down-regulated transcripts "response to stimulus"  was one of the most representative main functional categories . only up-regulated transcripts are present in the "secondary metabolic process" category . transcripts encoding proteins with no sequence homology to known proteins were defined as "no hits found" , while a similar percentage of transcripts showed homology to proteins involved in "unknown" biological process . a selection of differentially expressed and discussed in relation to fe deficiency is reported in table  <dig>  the up-regulation and down-regulation of six differentially expressed transcripts in response to fe deficiency were confirmed through real-time rt-pcr experiments .

sixty-one of  <dig> transcripts are ascribable to adaptive responses to fe deficiency involving fe homeostasis, metabolic process, oxidative stress responses, root morphological modification, transport processes, hormone metabolism and signaling. the others are hardly related to specific role showing homology to protein without a specific biological process or lacking homology to known protein .

fe homestasis
our transcriptional analysis confirmed that roots of fe-deficient tomato plants overexpressed genes involved in fe uptake and reduction, including the transcripts encoding iron-regulated transporter   <cit>  and feiii-chelate reductase   <cit> . the tomato bhlh protein  plays a role in fe-deficiency responses through the expression of these two tomato fe mobilization genes belonging to the fe uptake systems of the strategy i plants  <cit> . our data show the up-regulation of the fer transcript  in fe-deficient roots, which is in agreement with the positive modulation of fe-uptake-related transcripts such as lefro <dig> , leirt <dig>  and a transcript encoding a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein <dig>   <cit> . a positive modulation of fer and fe mobilization proteins  was not found in two proteomics studies performed in tomato roots grown in conditions similar to those used in the present work  <cit> . authors justified these results as related to the features of proteomic approach, which was not sensitive enough to detect fer and not well suited for membrane-bound proteins. however, functional characterizations of fer mutant proved that fer controls the expression of the iron-uptake genes  <cit> . a transcriptional behaviour similar to that described in the present work was observed for arabidopsis orthologous genes in fe-starved roots  <cit> .

our data show a strong down-regulation of another ferric chelate reductase . previous results indicated that the same transcript  specific to the solanum lycopersicum genome, is only slightly regulated by fe and that its function is not essential for fe uptake  <cit> . our results showing a negative regulation of this fro transcript in response to fe-deficiency in roots, also quantified by real-time rt-pcr experiment, confirm that this gene does not play a crucial role in deficiency-induced fe uptake and suggest the involvement in other biological process.

together with the positive modulation of lefer, lefro <dig> and leirt <dig>  we observed for the first time a high up-regulation of another bhlh transcript ; this result suggests that like in arabidopsis  <cit>  also in tomato plants the response to fe deficiency through fer activity may need the interaction with another bhlh protein. blastp analysis against tair database  <cit>  using protein sequence obtained from the predicted coding sequence of the tc <dig> showed the highest sequence homology with the protein encoded by atbhlh <dig>  known to interact with fit, the arabidopsis orthologous of tomato fer  <cit> .

the down-regulation of two ferritin transcripts  is in line with the negative regulation of ferritin genes observed in roots of fe-depleted arabidopsis plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that ferritins can be involved in fe homeostasis  <cit>  with a main role of plastidial fe  <cit> . arabidopsis nodulin-like genes have been recently described to be putatively involved in fe transport and storage under metal cation sufficiency  <cit> . transcriptional levels of arabidopsis nodulin-like genes were down-regulated at least until 72-h of fe-deficiency, while two other nodulin-like genes were not modulated in response to different fe conditions  <cit> . on the other hand in tomato roots we recorded a positive modulation of two transcripts encoding protein with a nodulin-like domain . blastp analysis against tair database  <cit>  using protein sequence obtained from the predicted coding sequence of the tc <dig>  showed the highest sequence homology with the protein encoded by at3g <dig>  which is one of the two arabidopsis genes not modulated by iron  <cit> .

metabolic processes
carbohydrate metabolism
as observed in arabidopsis root microarray analyses  <cit>  glycolysis-related genes are positively modulated in fe-deficient roots. these transcriptional data fit well with the increased activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , pyruvate kinase , and phosphofructokinase  recorded in response to fe starvation in cucumber roots  <cit> . furthermore, increased levels of protein related to glycolysis under fe shortage were recently reported in sugar beat  <cit>  and medicago truncatula  <cit>  roots. all together these evidences are consistent with the idea of a shift from anabolic to catabolic metabolism. in the present work, a fructose-bisphosphate aldolase   and a pfk  transcripts were up-regulated under fe deficiency, further confirming changes in primary metabolism in response to fe starvation. the positive modulation of transcript encoding a pfk, an enzyme catalysing a protogenic reaction, supports the role of glycolysis in different process such as production of atp and h+ for h+-atpase, reducing equivalents for ferric chelate reductase and of phosphoenolpyruvate   <cit> . up-regulation of three phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  transcripts  agrees with results of several proteomic and physiological studies on the response to fe deficiency in tomato  <cit> , sugar beat  <cit>  and medicago truncatula roots  <cit> , showing a positive modulation of proteins involved both in glycolysis and tca cycle. pepc activity, through pyruvate consumption, can keep active the glycolytic pathway and give a contribution to the control of cytosolic ph  <cit> . in fe deficiency, starch catabolism was reported to be enhanced both at transcriptional  <cit>  and protein level  <cit> . our analysis revealed a down-regulation of a transcript encoding a protein showing homology to a potato chloroplastic Ã-amylase  involved into starch degradation in plastids  <cit> . since starch catabolism mediated by this enzyme occurs in plastids, the negative modulation of Ã-amylase could be ascribed to other causes than an accelerated glycolysis.

the positive modulation of a cytochrome c oxidase  is in line with the transient induction of electron-transport-chain genes observed in arabidopsis  <cit>  and consistent with the enhancement of respiration rate observed in cumber  <cit>  and sugar beat  <cit>  fe-deficient roots. this behaviour was interpreted as an attempt to increase energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. however, more recently it has been suggested that the increased respiration rate in root segments of fe-starved cucumber plants should not be interpreted as an increase in mitochondrial activity but rather as the result of an increase in the number of less efficient mitochondria and of the induction of different o2-consuming reaction  <cit> .

methionine cycle
nicotianamine  is considered to be a key molecule for long-distance transport of fe in plants  <cit> . proteomic analysis of fe-starved tomato roots  <cit>  showed a positive modulation of proteins related to metabolism of methionine , a precursor of nicotianamine. an up-regulation of a transcript encoding a methylthioribose kinase , another enzyme of the methionine cycle, was observed in our transcriptional analysis. a positive modulation of mtk transcripts was also recorded in roots of rice, a strategy ii plant species, under fe deficiency  <cit> , although in this case, related to the necessity to increase the production of mugineic acid.

a down-regulation of a sulfate adenylyltransferase  gene  was observed in this work. however, the opposite was found in arabidopsis  <cit> . the connection between the sulphur nutritional status and capability to respond to fe shortage has been demonstrated in both strategy i and strategy ii plants  <cit> . recently an increase in methionine content related to phytosiderophore synthesis without significant changes in atps activity was described in fe-deficient barley roots  <cit> . interestingly, in a recent study of medicago truncatula root proteome  <cit>  two enzymes related to biosynthesis of cysteine and methionine were negatively affected by fe deficiency.

protein turnover
response to fe starvation induced the accumulation of gene transcripts related to protein turn-over, including protease  and peptidase  involved in protein degradation, and a gene encoding a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  that can act in the pre-mrna metabolism preceding protein synthesis.

the activity of these genes can be related to molecular events controlling plant responses to abiotic stresses such as nutritional deficiencies  <cit> . a general increase in protein synthesis was reported as a response to fe-deficiency in cucumber roots  <cit> ; furthermore, protein recycling in response to fe starvation was suggested by analysis of expression profiles of soybean  <cit>  and proteomic changes in cucumber  <cit>  and medicago troncatula  <cit>  roots. transcriptomic data presented here are in line with the idea that, under fe deficiency, n recycling reactions take place, possibly related to the necessity of additional anaplerotic source of c and n  <cit> .

secondary metabolism
phenolic compounds are reported as components of root exudates in fe-deficient strategy i plants. these molecules are involved in chelation and/or reduction of rhizospheric insoluble fe  <cit> . recently, phenolics have been proposed to selectively influence rhizospheric microorganisms and be involved in the reutilization of apoplastic fe  <cit> . our results showed an up-regulation of a flavonoid-3-hydroxylase  gene and of three genes putatively involved into flavonoid glycosylation . two out of the last three genes showed sequence homology to a catharanthus roseus flavonoid glucoside  <dig> -glucosyltransferase catalysing  <dig> -glucosylation of flavonol and flavone glucosides  <cit> . a positive modulation of genes related to general phenylpropanoid pathway  was reported in fe-deficient arabidopsis roots  <cit> . data of the present work underline the up-regulation of transcripts involved in a more specific branch of phenolic pathway supporting the idea that fe-starved roots might operate flavonoid secretion into the rhizosphere in order to promote fe acquisition  <cit> .

oxidative stress responses
many proteins involved in antioxidative defence response contain fe in heme group or coordinated to the thiol group of cysteine. the modulation of transcripts and proteins related to oxidative stress response in roots of fe-starved plants seems to depend on the species and the experimental conditions  <cit> . however, catalase  and peroxidase  activities are known to be depressed under fe deficiency conditions  <cit>  in tomato leaves. our data showed a main down-regulation of transcripts encoding thioredoxin   and detoxifying enzymes catalase , superoxide dismutase , peroxidase . two other pox transcripts  and a thioredoxin peroxidase gene  were, conversely, up-regulated. at protein level, a decrease of a cat was reported while some poxs showed higher levels in response to fe deficiency in tomato roots  <cit> ; a different response of peroxidase isoforms has also been reported in sunflower  <cit> . taken together, data of the present work suggest a different role in response to nutrient stress condition between the thioredoxin  and pox isogenes and are in agreement with previous results obtained in medicago truncatula  <cit>  and sugar beat  <cit>  fe-deficient roots.

a germin-like transcript  was up-regulated under fe deficiency, similarly to what has been observed in the tomato root proteome analysis  <cit> . the positive modulation of a germin protein reported in this proteomic study was justified hypothesizing its role in producing hydrogen peroxide for apoplastic fe reduction or in other stress response on the basis of sequence similarity to a nicotiana attenuata germin protein  <cit> .

root morphological adaptation
morphological modifications in roots of fe-deficient plants are well documented  <cit> . root hairs proliferation and development of transfer cells were described in fe-starved tomato plants  <cit> . enhanced formation of lateral roots and root hairs was also recorded in our experiment . extensin proteins seem to be involved in this latter phenomenon; in fact, we observed a strong positive modulation of leext <dig> , ledif <dig>  and ledif <dig> . it was reported that these three genes encode extensin, a structural protein putatively conferring physical characteristics of the cell wall  <cit> , and act during root hair formation in tomato due their predominant expression in root hair cells  <cit> .

the overexpression of an endo- <dig> -Î²-glucanase  and a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein  transcripts could be involved into the cell wall loosening  <cit>  associated to root morphological adaptation to fe deficiency, as previously observed in a tomato root proteomic analysis  <cit> . these changes in root morphology are also supported by the up-regulation of a transcript showing homology to a tobacco actin-depolymerizing factor  related to the pollen tube elongation  <cit> . here, we report a negative modulation of a transcript  showing homology to the tobacco aquaporin pip <dig>  <cit>  suggesting a role of the pip <dig> tomato protein in fe-related morphological root changes. it has been suggested that pip aquaporins can play a role not only in root water uptake but also in root development  <cit> . transgenic plants exhibiting rnai of pip <dig> aquaporins showed a significant increase in the length of primary roots  <cit> .

transport processes
among the positively modulated transcripts belonging to "transport" functional category, a stronger modulation  of an oligopeptide transporter  gene  was observed under fe shortage. blastp analysis against tair database  <cit>  using protein sequence obtained from the predicted coding sequence of the tc <dig>  showed the highest sequence homology with the protein encoded by atopt <dig> . positive modulation of atopt <dig> and atopt <dig> has been recorded in fe-deficient arabidopsis roots  <cit> . the plant members of otp family have been described to have different functions in transport physiology such as long-distance sulphur distribution, nitrogen mobilization, metal homeostasis, and heavy metal sequestration. opts can transport glutathione, metal-chelates and peptides  <cit> . it was hypothesized that some plants otps are able to transport fe-chelates and fe-na suggesting a role of these proteins in long-distance metal transport in planta  <cit> . a similar function can be hypothesized for the tomato up-regulated opt transcript, due to the previously described positive modulation of genes related to na synthesis .

another up-regulated gene involved in transport phenomena in response to fe-deficiency is leamt <dig> . this tomato gene, firstly isolated from a root hair cdna library  <cit>  was root-specifically expressed and positively regulated by ammonium  in root hairs  <cit> . this result suggests the presence of a linkage between nh4+ uptake and fe shortage. it has been demonstrated that nh4+-dependent rhizosphere acidification can improve fe availability in the rhizosphere  <cit> . interestingly, nitrate acquisition is limited under fe deficiency  <cit> .

furthermore, favouring ammonium uptake with respect to nitrate could reduce competition for reducing equivalent between nitrogen and fe acquisition. this is also in agreement with the hypothesized n-recycling in fe-deficient plant roots  <cit> .

fe-deficient tomato roots strongly overexpressed two transcripts  encoding a protein sharing features of major facilitator superfamily  with putative transport activities. however, on the basis of their sequence homology it was not possible to hypothesize an involvement in transport of a specific metabolite or mineral nutrient.

a positive modulation of a gene encoding a metal tolerance protein  was also recorded. a similar behaviour was described in fe-deficient arabidopsis roots  <cit>  and interpreted in the light of low specificity of irt <dig> transporters, which can transport different metals into the fe-deficient plants. mtp genes might therefore play a role in the detoxification of zinc ions taken up absorbed under fe deficiency conditions  <cit> .

fe deficiency in tomato induced the expression of a transcript  encoding a protein showing sequence homology to arabidopsis vacuolar aluminium-activated malate transporter   <dig>  <cit> . an increase in organic acids concentration mainly citric and malic acids in plant roots under fe starvation has been reported for many plant species  <cit> . however, a decrease of malate levels was observed in tomato root tips after 15-d of fe deficiency while higher contents were recorded in leaves and xylem sap  <cit> . the tomato malate transporter gene might be involved in malate fluxes at intracellular level and/or in long-distance transport in planta.

hormone metabolism and signaling
the role of plant hormones in the regulation of fe deficiency responses has been extensively studied  <cit> . as for arabidopsis col- <dig> accession, we identified the positive modulation of a methionine cycle gene, mtk gene, that could be related not only to na synthesis  but also to the recycling of methylthioadenosine during ethylene production  <cit> . this is in agreement with the hypothesized involvement of ethylene and/or auxin in control of hair root production under fe deficiency  <cit> . furthermore, data of the present work suggest the involvement of other hormones  in fe deficiency response in tomato roots. concerning gibberellin, we recorded the up-regulation of two gibberellin oxidase  <dig>  transcripts . they can regulate root morphological changes through the synthesis of active ga <dig>  indeed, it has been reported that gas are related to tomato root growth  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that the expression of a tomato slga20ox1:gus construct in arabidopsis localized also in columella of secondary roots  <cit> , thus suggesting a role in secondary root formation. the same authors also reported that the expression of the construct was positively affected in cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots by benziladenine, a synthetic cytokinin  <cit> . however cytokinins were described as negative regulators of root fe uptake mechanism in arabidopsis through a root-growth dependent pathway  <cit> . cytokinins could play a similar role also in tomato roots. this hypothesis is supported by the up-regulation of a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase  gene  under fe starvation. ckx genes are involved in regulation of plant growth and development through the control of the cytokinin concentration  <cit> .

focusing on signal transduction, we observed the up-regulation of a transcript  encoding a protein with sequence homology to the mcp <dig>  a protein phosphatase-2c  of mesembryanthemum crystallinum  <cit> . mcmcp <dig> is expressed in roots and is induced in response to salt and drought stresses  <cit> . the tomato pp2c gene could play a role in signal transduction of stress nutrient condition as fe starvation. the positive modulation of a gene encoding a src <dig> protein containing a c <dig> domain  suggests a putative involvement of ca as secondary messenger. focusing on ca, in our experiment we also identified a down-regulated gene  in fe-starved roots showing homology to an arabidopsis gene  encoding a cbl-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  <dig>  arabidopsis sos <dig> interacts with the ca binding protein sos <dig> , thus controlling k and na homeostasis and the response to salt stress  <cit> . in addition a negative modulation of a gene  showing homology to a tobacco avr/cf- <dig> rapidly elicited  transcript encoding a pp2c was observed  <cit> . our data confirm the results obtained with proteome analysis of tomato roots in response to fe-deficiency, where changes in the levels of proteins involved in signal transduction were reported  <cit> . the observed transcriptional changes in tomato roots can be the result of the perception of nutrient stress condition and the following signal transduction.

taken together, these results suggest that fe deficiency responses are, at least in part, dependent on hormonal balance modifications possibly resulting from signal perception and transduction.

CONCLUSIONS
ninety-seven differentially expressed transcripts were identified comparing root transcriptional profiles of fe-deficient and fe-sufficient tomato plants. tomato roots respond to fe deficiency by modulating the expression of a number of transcripts similar to the model plant arabidopsis. the comparison of tomato fe-responsive transcript set with the arabidopsis "ferrome"  <cit> , encompassing  <dig> transcripts that robustly represent the response to fe shortage, confirms the involvement of the well know homologous key regulatory elements  controlling the expression of transcripts related to fe uptake and translocation . as showed by arabidopsis "ferrome"  <cit> , tomato roots modulate transcripts involved in homeostasis of fe and heavy metal cations  and others cation . both plant species require the up-regulation of transcripts related to glycolysis  and methionine cycle , the latter pathway being putatively linked to na biosynthesis in response to fe deficiency. fe-na complexes could be transported both in tomato and arabidopsis plants through opts during the response to fe shortage. here we describe, for the first time, the modulation of a specific branch of phenolic  biosynthesis in response to fe deficiency. in addition, tomato roots seem to be more characterized by root morphological adaptation, mainly linked to hair root production, as suggested by the strong up-regulation of extensin transcripts.

therefore, this transcriptional study, while confirming evidence coming from proteomic studies, allowed identifying new putative targets for further functional investigations on the response to fe deficiency in tomato roots.
