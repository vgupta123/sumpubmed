BACKGROUND
the innate immune system is an ancestral and ubiquitous system of defense against microbial infection and other potential threats to the host. the first mammalian molecules shown to be involved in innate immune recognition of, and defense against, microbial pathogens are the toll-like receptors , which constitute the main sensors for detection of extracellular microbes  <cit> . recent research has shown that nod-like receptors  act as intracellular regulators of bacterial-induced inflammation  <cit> .

the nlr protein family is separated into several subfamilies based on the different n-terminal effecter domains  <cit> . the nlrp subfamily  is a new identified nlr group characterized by a pyrin domain. initially, research on the function of nlrp proteins focused on their roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways via the formation of a large signaling platform  and the activation of caspases in innate immunity  <cit> . interestingly, more and more researches have recently revealed that some nlrp genes play roles in mammalian reproduction. for instance, the mouse nlrp <dig>  was one of the first identified mammalian maternal effect genes, i.e. it encodes mrna required for successful development of a fertilized oocyte  <cit> . in particular, the targeted invalidation of mouse oocyte-specific nlrp <dig> leads to the sterility of females due to a blockage at the two-cell stage in the development of embryos  <cit> . in vitro knockdown experiments in mouse fertilized eggs also revealed that a decrease of mouse germ-cell-specific nlrp <dig> transcripts results in an arrest of development between the one-cell and eight-cell stages of the embryos  <cit> . in the mouse, exclusive duplications of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> have been detected with specific expression profiles restricted to the oocyte  <cit> , whereas the mouse nlrp4a and the cattle nlrp <dig> have also been reported to be expressed in the testis  <cit> . in humans, the mutations of nlrp <dig> are found to cause recurrent hydatidiform moles, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and intrauterine growth retardation  <cit> . additionally, the recent expression analyses of nlrp genes in the human and the rhesus macaque  have shown that most if not all nlrp genes are expressed in primate gametes and early embryos, suggesting a role of nlrps in primate pre-implantation development  <cit> .

overall, it seems that the nlrp genes play roles not only in innate immunity but also in the reproductive system of mammals. moreover, nalp <dig> and nalp <dig> invalidation data in the mouse suggests that there is no functional compensation of each of these oocyte-specific genes. in this context, one question is to study how these reproduction-related nlrp genes evolved and diverged in function after their duplication, as well as whether natural selection played a role during their evolution.

the availability of several completely sequenced vertebrate genomes allows us to use a phylogenomic approach to identify the nlrp orthologues from different mammals and to evaluate the evolutionary features of nlrps in different lineages. in this paper, we focus on the evolution and functional divergence of reproduction-related nlrps, as well as lineage-specific expansion of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> in rodents. the aim of the present work is to provide new information in understanding how nlrp genes evolve in reproductive system and how different mammals adapted to develop their own nlrp gene copies particularly in reproductive biology.

RESULTS
phylogeny and syntenic comparison of nlrps
a total of  <dig> mammalian nlrp amino acid sequences with chicken nlrp3-like as outgroup were used for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. a total of  <dig> positions are included in the final dataset.

in the consensus phylogenetic tree , each nlrp protein, except for nlrp <dig>  is shown to be monophyletic by all four methods with high bootstrap values. nlrp <dig> encompasses the primate-specific nlrp <dig>  suggesting the origin of nlrp <dig> from a duplication of the nlrp2/ <dig> ancestor in primates. nlrp <dig> is also primate-specific and might be related to the reproduction-related nlrp <dig> and  <dig>  nlrp <dig> proteins are only identified in primates and rodents, indicating the potential birth of the ancestral nlrp <dig> gene before the divergence between primates and rodents. otherwise, the other nlrp genes seem to have duplicated before the divergence of mammals.

in rodents, three nlrp genes show lineage-specific duplications including nlrp <dig>  nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> . more specifically, nlrp <dig> exclusively duplicated in the mouse, nlrp <dig> duplicated independently in the rodents after the separation of mouse and rat, whereas the duplication of nlrp <dig> is likely to have occurred both before and after this separation.

unexpectedly, nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> seem to be universal in mammals except for rodents. we speculate that these two genes might have been lost during evolution of the rodents. unfortunately, our tblastn search  failed to find any trace of pseudogene of neither nlrp <dig> nor nlrp <dig> within the mouse conserved syntenic region. we found that, on the human chromosome  <dig>  these two genes are located side by side between nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  whereas the mouse nlrp <dig> gene has been expansively duplicated and the duplicates are located around nlrp <dig> on the mouse chromosome  <dig>  in rodents, the biological significance of the probable loss of nlrp <dig> and  <dig> on one hand, and the parallel expansion of nlrp <dig> on the other hand, remains unknown.

remarkably, our phylogenetic analyses identified a well supported  reproduction-related clade including nine nlrp proteins: nlrp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . all these nlrp genes have been shown to be expressed in the human oocyte and pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . nlrp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively expressed in germ-cells, especially in the oocyte of mammals  <cit> . the mutations of nlrp <dig> are associated with abnormal embryo development in the human  <cit> . the expression of mouse nlrp <dig> has been found to be highly enriched in fully grown oocytes but diminished in the 2-cell embryos upon embryo genome activation  <cit> . in both the human  <cit>  and the rhesus macaque  <cit> , nlrp <dig> and  <dig> have been found specifically or preferentially expressed in the oocyte, with a similar expression pattern to other oocyte-specific nlrp genes, i.e., enriched in maturing oocytes and then progressively diminished in embryos, indicating an exclusive maternal origin of these transcripts. unfortunately, the biological study of these two genes is not sufficient to address their putative roles in reproduction.

moreover, this reproduction-related clade is also supported by the syntenic analysis . in the human genome, all the reproduction-related nlrp genes, except for nlrp <dig>  are tandemly located on the chromosome 19q <dig> , suggesting that multiple tandem duplication events might have given birth to these genes. the similar arrangements of the reproduction-related nlrps are also found in cattle and dog genomes . in the mouse genome, the reproduction-related nlrps  are not located side by side, but interrupted by some other types of genes, especially and mainly by certain v1r genes  on chromosome 7a <dig> and 7a <dig>  although nlrp <dig> is not located in the syntenic region encompassing other reproduction-related nlrps in all the studied mammalian genomes , our phylogenetic result and the published expression profile show that this gene is close to other reproduction-related nlrps. this suggests that early  genomic rearrangements might have resulted in the separation of nlrp <dig> from its relatives.

we identified the other nlrp members  as non-reproduction-related nlrp genes, because they are not in the reproduction-related clade in the phylogenetic trees and ubiquitously expressed. these genes have been shown to participate in inflammatory and immune responses by regulating the activation of other signaling factors, such as nf-κb, caspase- <dig> and il-1β  <cit> . in contrast, little is known about the function of the reproduction-related nlrp proteins in inflammation and immunity, except that the human nlrp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may be able to inhibit il-1β and/or nf-κb  <cit> , and thus may contribute to modulate the inflammatory response. it is known that inflammation and bacterial infection can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy and abortion  <cit> . thus, nlrp proteins might play roles both in innate immunity and in reproductive biology.

functional divergence
in the reproduction-related nlrp cluster referred by the phylogenetic analysis above, there are several oocyte-specific nlrp genes including nlrp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  to investigate whether functional divergence have occurred following the duplications of these oocyte-specific nlrps, four oocyte-expressed nlrp genes  were estimated for functional divergence by using the diverge program  <cit> . nlrp <dig>  which was not found in rodents, was therefore not included in this analysis in order to compare the level of divergence across all candidate species.

after alignment and removal of the sites with gaps, a total of  <dig> amino acid sites are included in the analysis. pairwise comparisons of each of the four oocyte-expressed nlrp gene clusters  were carried out and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence position was estimated. as shown in table  <dig>  functional divergence is significant between each comparison  by both mfe and mle methods, indicating that site-specific altered selective constraints should contribute to the functional evolution of the oocyte-specific nlrp genes after their duplication.

θ, coefficient of functional divergence; mfe, model-free method; mle, maximum-likelihood estimation under two-state model; p value, significance level calculated by the method of fisher's transformation on z scale, and from chi square on lrt; rfd no., number of residues with predicted functional divergence;-cutoff, the minimal posterior probability for amino acids causing functional divergence, established empirically by progressively removing the highest scoring residues from the alignment until θ dropped to zero.

furthermore, the important amino acid residues, responsible for functional divergence, were predicted by calculating the site-specific profile based on posterior analysis for all pairs of clusters with functional divergence. in order to extensively reduce false positive, cutoff values, i.e., the minimal posterior probabilities for rfd  were established empirically by progressively removing the highest scoring residues from the alignment until θ dropped to zero. as shown in table  <dig>  the least rfd  are observed between nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  and the most rfd  are observed between nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  in general, the rfd are detected in all three functional domains  of nlrp proteins, implying that shifted functional constrains might have acted on each protein domain.

segmental duplications concerning nlrp <dig> and v1r genes in the mouse genome
in the mouse, there are seven nlrp <dig> gene copies  which are specifically expressed in oocytes  <cit> . our lab has also found the expression of nlrp4a in the testis by rt-pcr  <cit> . nlrp4a-4e genes are located on chromosome 7a, but nlrp4f and 4g are located on chromosomes 13b <dig> and chromosome  <dig> respectively. by the tblastn method, we identified six additional putative pseudogenes on chromosome 7a . based on the phylogenetic tree , multiple duplications of mouse nlrp <dig> could be depicted as follows. nlrp4b might be the earliest nlrp <dig> copy in the mouse genome with an orthologue present in the rat genome, suggesting an origin before the separation of mouse and rat. the duplication of ancestral nlrp4b is supposed to have given rise to nlrp4d, and the subsequent duplications might have resulted in nlrp4f/4g and nlrp4a/4c. subsequent chromosomal rearrangements might have caused the independent locations of nlrp4f and nlrp4g with other nlrp <dig> duplicates. all the putative nlrp4h-4m pseudogene sequences show high identities with each other as well as with nlrp4e. in fact, in all the pseudogenes, a common frameshift of 1-bp deletion was detected at the position corresponding to 358aa of nlrp4e and it caused a subsequent prematural stop codon at the position of 434aa, suggesting that the pseudogenization had happened before duplications of these copies.

in the mouse genome, nlrp <dig> duplicates  are located between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on the chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, all these nlrp <dig> duplicates are found next to the vomeronasal  <dig> receptor encoding genes , such as v1rd and v1re genes . the phylogeny and genomic location of these v1r genes reveal that v1r genes might have a similar duplication model to their neighbors, nlrp <dig> genes . thus, one may hypothesize that nlrp <dig> may have not duplicated one by one, but were rather involved in segmental duplications encompassing several different genes, such as v1r genes.

vomeronasal organ, which is well developed in rodents in comparison with human, detects pheromones and other chemical signals implicated in innate reproductive and social behaviours between the members of the same species  <cit> . the v1r gene family is supposed to have emerged during the divergence of placental mammals , but many subfamilies including v1rd and v1re originated only in rodents after their separation from the primates  <cit> , which is consistent with the rodent-specific duplication of nlrp <dig>  thus, the phylogenetic relationship and genomic location  of these v1r genes, that are located in the segmental duplication region, could help us to better understand the segmental duplications. overall, as shown in figure 3b, a presumed itinerary of segmental duplication was deduced by combining phylogeny with genomic location of both nlrp <dig> duplicates and v1r genes. although we can not confirm the order of duplication events by the present data, we can state that segmental duplication events characterize the evolution of this genomic region.

positive selection on nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> paralogues in the mouse
several examples have shown that genes in duplication blocks could be maintained by positive selection  <cit> . here, we implemented paml <dig>  <cit>  to investigate the model of selective force acting on mouse nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> duplicates during their evolution.

by using site models, estimates of the parameter values under m2a and m <dig>  indicate that a fraction of sites  may be under positive selection in both datasets . lrts of all comparisons  are significant  for both datasets , implying that selective forces varied among amino acid sites and that the mouse nlrp <dig> and  <dig> genes might have been subjected to positive selection after their expansion. furthermore, the comparison of model mec  versus model m8a  also supports positive selection in these two gene clusters. the aicc scores of mec are lower than those of m8a, indicating that mec better fits the data, i.e. positive selection is significant.

note. - log-likelihood values  are given for each model. the value ωs is the average dn/ds ratio for sites under positive selection in the models m2a and m <dig>  p and q are the shape parameters for the beta distribution of ω in m <dig> and m <dig>  ρ <dig>  ρ <dig>  and ρs are the proportions of codons subject to purifying, neutral, and positive selection, respectively. * p value is significant at  <dig> . predicted positively selected sites with posterior probabilities > 95% are listed, and the sites with p > 99% are in boldface. site numbers and amino acids refer to the reference sequences nlrp4a  and nlrp9a  for the two datasets, respectively.

subsequently, we wanted to know if the target of positive selection had changed during evolution in these two gene clades. we compared the potential sites subjected to positive selection between the two datasets . in nlrp4_mouse dataset,  <dig> sites  are identified as positively selected sites at p > 95% level by both m2a and m <dig> models, and  <dig> more sites  are identified only by the m <dig> model. in nlrp9_mouse dataset,  <dig> sites  are identified as potential targets of positive selection by both m2a and m <dig> models, and  <dig> more sites  is identified only by the m <dig> model. we note that no common sites are shared by the two datasets as positively selected sites at p > 95% level, suggesting a dramatic shift in the target of positive selection between the nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> genes in the mouse. when the 3d structures or models of these proteins are available in the future, we could investigate whether these positively selected sites are located in functionally pivotal regions.

discussion
independent evolution of reproduction-related nlrp genes in different mammalian lineages
phylogenetic analyses show that nlrp genes have been originated and duplicated before the divergence of mammals. certain genes are well conserved during their evolution, such as nlrp <dig> , whereas many genes involved in reproduction have rapidly evolved resulting in higher sequence divergence among lineages, such as nlrp <dig>  and nlrp <dig> . the pairwise estimates of evolutionary divergence between the reproduction-related paralogues are ranged from 61% to 75% , which is obviously higher than the one between the non-reproduction-related paralogues . moreover, gene duplication and/or gene loss is found to have occurred independently in different mammalian lineages. on the one hand, nlrp <dig>  and nlrp <dig> have been extensively duplicated in rodents, and other lineage-specific gene duplication events concern the specific duplication of nlrp <dig>  in the mouse as well as the unique origin of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> in primates. on the other hand, nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> are seemed to be lost from the genomes of rodents. interestingly, the major gene duplication and gene loss events are found to be associated with the reproduction-related genes , implying that reproduction-related genes have undertaken a fast and diverged evolution among different mammalian lineages. given note that major reproduction-related nlrp genes are germ-cell specific, whereas the other non-reproduction-related genes are usually expressed in multiple tissues from a single organism. recent large-scale gene expression studies have shown that the tissue specificity of genes is correlated positively with gene evolution rates  <cit> . furthermore, our result reinforces the hypothesis that reproduction-related genes are most highly divergent and evolve more rapidly than genes expressed in other organs  <cit> .

functional divergence of the oocyte-specific genes
gene duplication is thought to be the essential source of gene novelty, with new or altered functions, as shown by widespread existence of gene families. among nlrp genes, there are at least four oocyte specifically expressed in mammals, including nlrp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these genes have been found to be restricted expressed in oocytes and early embryos  <cit> , suggesting their important roles in oogenesis and preimplantation embryo development. additionally, their temporal expression in oocytes and degradation during preimplantation development coincide with the timing of gene expression transition from maternal to zygotic control, indicating their roles as maternal effect genes.

in the present work, by using an in silico method , we demonstrate that the functional divergence could have occurred between each pair of oocyte-specific nlrp genes. this result is supported by certain published experimental data. for example, the knock-out of mouse nlrp <dig> induced female infertility due to a blockage of early embryonic development  <cit> ; and the injection of sirna against nlrp <dig> into fertilized eggs resulted in arrested development of embryos between 1-cell and 8-cell stages  <cit> . these results suggest that the expression of other oocyte-specific nlrp genes is not able to compensate the absence of neither nlrp <dig> nor nlrp <dig> genes. additionally, recent research has shown that nlrp <dig> is also expressed in the testis and its mutation might cause spermatogenic failure in the human  <cit> . thus, we presume that the expressional divergence of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> during the development of mouse germ-cells and embryos may lead to functional specialization. on the other hand, target invalidation/inhibition of nlrp <dig> and  <dig> did not reveal any deleterious effect on ovarian folliculogenesis but rather in early embryonic development, suggesting other genes might play the similar roles during folliculogenesis and meiotic maturation. for these latter functions, plausible candidates could be other oocyte-specific nlrp genes, such as nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  to investigate this possibility, further functional studies such as knock-out models or other targeted inhibition experiments on these genes should be carried out.

gene duplication is thought to be a major driving force in enabling the evolution of tissue specialization. by using microarray gene expression data from mammals  <cit> , fruit flies and yeast  <cit> , it has recently shown that as gene family size enlarges, there is a general trend for paralogous genes with decreased breadth and increased specificity of expression. in particular, by studying the relationship between gene family size and expression breadth of  <dig> protein families in the mouse, freilich and his colleagues  <cit>  have recently demonstrated that duplicates that arose through post-multicellularity duplication events show a tendency to become more specifically expressed, supporting the view suggested by the subfunctionalization model  <cit> . in our case, especially with the evidence that nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> genes are significantly involved in different developmental stages of embryos, we hypothesize that the functional divergence of oocyte-specific nlrp duplicates might be derived by the expression specialization of duplicate genes, which could provide the mammals reproductive advantages such as in adaptation.

segmental duplication in the mouse genome
the phylogenetic research indicates the rodent-specific expansion of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  and the furthermore genomic analyses find that these nlrp duplicates, especially nlrp <dig>  have been duplicated together with other genes, such as v1r copies. this segmental duplication is not rare during the mouse and human genomic evolution. it has recently revealed that the segmental duplication constitutes about 5% of mouse genome, and its distribution is in a highly non-random fashion  <cit> . interestingly, the duplication blocks account for 32% of the first  <dig> mb of the chromosome  <dig>  where the segmental duplications concerning nlrp <dig> and v1r genes are located. nlrp <dig> has been also duplicated in this region, but its duplication scenario is not clear and might be due to subsequent recombination.

as found in the human  <cit> , the segmental duplication regions in the mouse might also be "hot spots" for the occurrence of non-allelic homologous recombination, leading to genomic mutations such as deletion, duplication, inversion or translocation  <cit> . thus, these instable regions might have a biological significance in form of genome evolution  <cit> .

adaptive diversification after gene duplications in nlrp <dig> and nlrp9
in the mouse, nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> are specifically extensive in gene copies. by using site-models implemented in paml <dig>  we evaluated the variation of selective pressure acting on nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig> duplicates, respectively. our result shows that positive selection is significant in both datasets, which consistent with other reports referring that the rapid divergence of the reproductive genes may be driven by positive selection  <cit> . in particular, in the mouse, several gene cluster concerning lineage-specific expansion of reproduction-related genes have been found to be under adaptive evolution , such as the sva  gene cluster  <cit> , the prame  gene cluster  <cit> , the psg  gene cluster  <cit> , the rhox <dig> gene cluster  <cit>  and the svs  gene cluster  <cit> . the lineage-independent expansion and subsequently rapid evolution of such genes might contribute to speciation or adaptation, such as genetic barriers between species and hybrid incompatibilities, or provide the species specification in reproductive processes such as sperm competition, host immunity to pathogens, and manipulation of female/male reproductive physiology and behavior. in the case of nlrp <dig> and  <dig> genes, their biological functions are still unclear, so we can not evaluate the significance of their specific duplications in the reproduction of the mouse. however, the similar evolutionary mechanism driven by positive selection suggests that after duplication, these nlrp gene copies diverged and acquired abilities  to adapt the new environment. in the subsequent research, the adaptive evolution of the other reproduction-related nlrp genes could be further evaluated. hopefully, when the biological functions of these nlrp genes are elucidated, the nature of the selective pressure acting on nlrps will be better understood.

interestingly, the evolution of v1r genes, the other genes involved in the segmental duplication with nlrp <dig> and  <dig>  is also driven by positive selection in rodents  <cit> . v1r proteins are thought to be responsible for the detection of pheromones that induce innate reproductive behaviors between members of the same species  <cit> . thus, it is presumed that the adaptive evolution of the v1r genes might play an important role in reinforcing pre-zygotic barriers among species of rodents  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
nlrp genes have originated and duplicated mainly before the divergence of mammals. during evolution, nlrps, especially the reproduction-related nlrp genes, have undergone a fast and independent diversification in different mammalian lineages. the expansion of reproduction-related nlrp genes has been associated with functional divergence after duplication, suggesting that each nlrp oocyte-specific gene might play an essential role in oogenesis and early preimplantation embryo development. the mouse-specific expansion of nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  concerning segmental duplication events, has been driven by positive evolution. our founding suggests that the duplication and functional divergence of nlrp might provide mammals advantages in reproductive biology.
