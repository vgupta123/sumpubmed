BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis represents a serious public health problem in  <dig> countries, occurring mainly in economically disadvantaged regions  <cit> . few drug therapy discoveries have been made in recent decades. the first-line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis consists of only pentavalent antimonials, but their toxicity is a major issue  <cit> . although these drugs are not an ideal treatment, none of the other many investigated drugs are better than pentavalent antimonials with regard to safety, efficacy, and cost  <cit> . investigations of potentially active molecules are important to discover less toxic drugs that are viable economic alternatives for the treatment of leishmaniasis.

thiosemicarbazones are a group of molecules whose biological properties have long been investigated  <cit> . antiviral, antiprotozoal, antitumor, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties have been reported for some thiosemicarbazones  <cit> . phase  <dig> clinical trials that investigated 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, also known as triapine, were completed for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and patients are currently being recruited for phase  <dig> clinical trials for vaginal cancer  <cit> .

thus, this chemical group is known for its wide versatility and biological activity, which is mainly associated with a metal complex or the presence of different substituent groups, such as limonene. these purposeful molecular changes appear to improve the biological properties of the molecule, increase the potential for activity, and lessen cytotoxicity in an attempt to reach a specific target in the parasite, such as mitochondria  <cit> . the main cellular targets of some thiosemicarbazones have been previously reported, indicating from molecular and chemistry targets, such as viral rna synthesis and tyrosinase activity respectively, to organelles dysfunction, like mitochondria function  <cit> . the present study examined the antileishmania activity and mechanism of action of a novel molecule, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, derived from s-limonene against l. amazonensis.

RESULTS
bzts inhibited l. amazonensis proliferation in vitro
to determine the effects of bzts  on the cellular proliferation of l. amazonensis, the parasites were incubated with bzts  for 72 h. bzts dose-dependently inhibited the growth of the promastigote and axenic amastigote forms, with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively. bzts exerted activity against intracellular amastigotes at an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  μm. bzts was also evaluated for its cytotoxic effects on the macrophage strain j774a <dig>  with a cc <dig> of  <dig>  μm. cytotoxicity in j774a <dig> macrophages and activity against promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and intracellular amastigotes were compared using the selectivity index . the observed sis were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and intracellular amastigotes, respectively. these results demonstrate that bzts is more toxic to the protozoa than to macrophages .figure  <dig>

bzts induced morphological and ultrastructural changes
scanning electron microscopy revealed that bzts caused morphological alterations in the promastigote forms of l. amazonensis compared with untreated parasites, which showed typical characteristics, with an elongated shape and free flagellum. figure  <dig> shows alterations in shape and size and cellular disintegration in bzts-treated parasites. these alterations were more pronounced in parasites treated with the ic <dig>  of bzts. to evaluate the alterations in cell shape and size in promastigote forms revealed by sem, the treated parasites were assessed by flow cytometry. the histogram showed that bzts-treated parasites exhibited a reduction of parasite volume . a dose-dependent decrease in cell volume was observed .figure  <dig>

transmission electron microscopy of bzts-treated promastigotes and axenic amastigotes showed the presence of several ultrastructural alterations . bzts induced severe damage in parasite mitochondria, reflected by extensive swelling and disorganization in the inner mitochondrial membrane, intense cytoplasmic vacuolization, and the presence of concentric membrane structures inside the organelle. cytoplasmic lipid bodies, vesicles inside vacuoles in the flagellar pocket, and enlargement were also observed.figure  <dig>

to confirm the accumulation of lipid bodies in treated promastigotes observed by tem, we evaluated the existence of this structure using nile red staining, which stains neutral lipids. fluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of lipid bodies in control promastigotes, but the presence of lipid bodies was enhanced after treatment with the ic <dig> and ic <dig> of bzts for 72 h . this structure appeared to be randomly distributed throughout the parasite cytoplasm.figure  <dig>

bzts altered ∆Ψm but not cell membrane integrity
alterations in cell membrane integrity were evaluated by pi staining, which is a nucleic acid stain that penetrates cells with a compromised plasma membrane and does not cross the membranes of live cells. bzts-treated, pi-labeled promastigotes did not show significant permeabilization of the plasma membrane compared with untreated parasites. bzts at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 555 μm showed pi fluorescence intensity of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the negative control showed pi fluorescence intensity of  <dig> %, and the positive control  showed pi fluorescence intensity of  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that bzts induced alterations in parasite mitochondria, and we evaluated the ∆Ψm by flow cytometry using rh  <dig>  which accumulates within energized mitochondria. the histograms  revealed a decrease in total rh  <dig> fluorescence intensity, indicating mitochondrial membrane depolarization. bzts at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 555 μm caused  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % decreases in total rh  <dig> fluorescence intensity, respectively, compared with the negative control. such decreases were further quantified as iv values. promastigotes that were treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 555 μm bzts had iv values of − <dig> , − <dig> , − <dig> , and − <dig> , respectively.figure  <dig>

bzts did not induce phosphatidylserine exposure
phosphatidylserine  is a phospholipid that is confined to the inner face of the plasma membrane and translocates to the cell surface in apoptotic cells. annexin v is a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein that preferentially binds ps . annexin v-fitc was used to evaluate the externalization of phosphatidylserine. as shown in figure  <dig>  no significant increase in annexin-v fluorescence intensity was observed compared with untreated parasites, indicating no phosphatidylserine exposure. the histograms showed annexin-v fluorescence intensity of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % at bzts concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 555 μm, respectively. the negative control showed annexin-v fluorescence intensity of  <dig> %. the positive control  showed a  <dig> % increase in annexin-v fluorescence intensity.figure  <dig>

bzts caused mitochondrial o2•ˉ production
after observing severe damage in parasite mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, we evaluated the production of o2•ˉ. mitochondrion-derived o2•ˉ production was evaluated using mitosox reagent, which measures the mitochondrial accumulation of superoxide based on its hydrophobic nature and positively charged triphenylphosphonium moiety. mitosox oxidation was higher in bzts-treated parasites compared with controls. the increase in mitosox oxidation in bzts-treated promastigotes was observed after 1 h of incubation. treatment with  <dig> and 555 μm caused higher mitosox oxidation than the lower concentrations .figure  <dig>

discussion
drug therapy for leishmaniasis has not significantly changed since the beginning of the 20th century, and adequate treatment remains a problem because of toxicity and side effects. new treatments that are more effective and less toxic are urgently needed  <cit> . investigations of new drugs with antileishmanial activity, including both natural products and synthetic compounds, have been performed worldwide  <cit> .

in the present study, we showed that bzts had antiproliferative effects on promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, with a reduction of survival of intracellular parasites in macrophages. moreover, bzts was more selective for the protozoa than for mammalian cells. bzts exerted its antileishmanial activity by affecting parasite mitochondrial function, indicated by tem, variations in ∆Ψm by flow cytometry using rh  <dig>  and the production of o2•ˉ evaluated by mitosox oxidation.

the single mitochondrion of the kinetoplastid parasite is an attractive chemotherapeutic target because its functional features are markedly distinct from mammalian mitochondria  <cit> . our previous studies showed the in vitro antileishmanial activity of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derived from limonene complexed with copper against l. amazonensis, with an effect on mitochondrial function  <cit> . inácio et al.  reported that epigallocatechin-3-gallate induced death in l. amazonensis by directly affecting mitochondrial physiology in treated parasites. these effects were detected as ultrastructural alterations of the mitochondria, organelle injury, and a decrease in rh  <dig> fluorescence. monzote et al.   <cit>  suggested that the antileishmania activity of the essential oil and major constituents  of chenopodium ambroisiodes against l. amazonensis promastigotes is correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, reflected by ∆Ψm. further studies by our group demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations and ∆Ψm changes in parasites treated with thiophene derivatives isolated from the aerial parts of porophyllum ruderale, a β-carbolinic compound , and eupomatenoid- <dig>  a neolignan isolated from the leaves of piper regnellii  <cit> . luque-ortega et al.   <cit>  also showed that benzophenone-derived bisphosphonium salts present antileishmania activity against promastigotes of the leishmania donovani causing a dramatically swollen mitochondrion in treated parasites, and a decrease of the electrochemical mitochondrial potential.

mitochondrial changes may be a consequence of many harmful effects induced by endogenous toxic compounds, such as reactive oxygen species . bzts induced the production of these compounds, which may be responsible for mitochondrial injury and the induction of oxidative damage in lipids and proteins, reflected by variations in ∆Ψm using rh  <dig> and the production of o2•ˉ. these results are similar to those reported by volpato et al.  and desoti et al.   <cit> , in which trypanosoma cruzi were treated with n-butyl-1- phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxamide and -elatol extracted from the red macroalgae laurencia dendroidea, respectively. this effect was also reported by medina et al. , in which l. amazonensis promastigotes were treated with tomatidine.

electrons move through the mitochondrial respiratory chain during oxidative phosphorylation, and a proton gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane as an energy source for adenosine triphosphate . a decrease in rh  <dig> fluorescence intensity suggests an increase in proton permeability across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which can decrease atp synthesis and result in parasite death  <cit> . in the present study, we can infer that this process occurred, based on the rh  <dig> assays. furthermore, an association was observed between multivesicular bodies and mitochondrion profiles, likely indicating an autophagic process that removes damaged organelles. in the present study, tem indicated the presence of several vesicles.

mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations, the reduction of ΔΨm, and the increase in ros production caused by bzts may be explained by calcium release from mitochondria, indicating a direct action of bzts on the organelle and the inhibition of sterol biosynthesis, leading to alterations in the lipid composition of mitochondrial membranes that can modify mitochondrial function  <cit> . recently, shioji tiuman et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that when the amastigotes were treated with parthenolide, a lipophilic hydrocarbon compound formed by units of isoprene, revealed mitochondrial damage, suggesting that this compound interferes with the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to alteration of atp generation and in consequence cell damage takes place.

another important effect of bzts on parasites was the accumulation of intracellular lipid bodies in the cytoplasm indicated by fluorescence microscopy. the analysis of the treated parasites using differential interference contrast microscopy revealed alterations in shape, principally by treatment with the ic <dig> of bzts, showing a rounded shape and evidence of the loss of cytoplasmic content. similar results were reported by macedo-silva et al. , in which promastigote forms were treated with amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug used for the treatment of chagas’ disease. the presence of intracellular lipid bodies may indicate alterations in phospholipids and sterol content  <cit> .

bzts did not significantly increase annexin-v fluorescence intensity in treated parasites, indicating no phosphatidylserine exposure. in contrast, we found that bzts induced several alterations in the mitochondrial ultrastructure and shape of the parasite. the mitochondria exhibited intense swelling, with the loss of matrix content, the presence of concentric membranes, inner membrane disorganization, severe changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, the reduction of cell volume, and ros production. these observations may indicate parasite death caused by apoptosis. shivahare et al.   <cit>  showed that a chromenochalcone exhibited leishmanicidal effects against leishmania donovani by causing loss in membrane potential and phosphatidylserine exposure, thus exerting cell death via apoptosis in treated promastigotes.

however, the hypothesis of an autophagic process cannot be discarded because the presence of autophagic vacuoles, increases in the number of lipidic inclusions, and presence of concentric membranes in the cytoplasm are characteristic of autophagic processes and may be associated with the accumulation of aberrant lipids that are probably not entirely incorporated into the plasma membrane or the membranes that line the various cellular organelles  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that bzts has potent antiproliferative activity against different evolutive forms of leishmania amazonensis and induced marked effects on the morphology and ultrastructure of this parasite, such as interference with various cellular processes that led to changes in shape and mitochondrial function, the accumulation of lipid droplets, and features found in cells that die from apoptotic or autophagic processes.
