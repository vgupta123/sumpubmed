BACKGROUND

neisseria meningitidis  is a gram-negative bacterium, which is frequently carried asymptomatically in the human nasopharynx. it is considered to be an “accidental pathogen”: a normally commensal organism that occasionally invades the bloodstream causing septicemia and/or meningitis. the factors that determine whether a person infected with nm becomes a carrier or a case remain poorly understood. meningococcal genetic and antigenic diversity are likely to be important and whole genome comparative analysis of carriage and disease isolates provides one means of investigating this. different approaches have been used to compare carried and invasive isolates. early studies compared the proportions of clonal complexes , defined by multi locus sequence typing , among serogroups and identified hyper-virulent lineages that were overrepresented in invasive isolates and less common in carriage samples  <cit> . more recent studies have used whole genome technology to compare a broad range of disease and carriage isolates. these studies have, for example, identified a prophage present in some disease-associated isolates but not limited to them . another recent study compared carried and invasive serogroup y nm  from the uk and identified a disease-associated clone  <cit> ; however, there is still much uncertainty over what determines the carried or invasive state, especially during epidemics.

for over 100 years, the sahelian and sub-sahelian regions of africa, the african meningitis belt, have experienced large epidemics of meningococcal disease . serogroup a n. meningitidis  was the most common cause in this region before the introduction of the tt-psa conjugate vaccine , which started in  <dig> and will have been deployed in all  <dig> countries of the meningitis belt by the end of  <dig>  with  <dig> million doses administered at the time of writing. since vaccine implementation, other previously less common groups including w , c , x , and y  have been more frequently associated with meningococcal disease in this region  <cit> .

the southern part of the republic of chad lies in the african meningitis belt and has been subject to recurrent meningitis outbreaks since the early 1900s  <cit> . since  <dig>  nmw and nma have alternated as the major epidemic strains in small-scale outbreaks  <cit> . a large epidemic was recorded in chad in 2011: seventeen districts reached the epidemic threshold of  <dig> per  <dig>  per week and a total of  <dig> suspect cases and  <dig> deaths were reported. cerebrospinal fluid samples  were obtained from only  <dig> % of the cases for laboratory confirmation, but nma was the pathogen identified most commonly by culture and sero-agglutination methods  <cit> . vaccination with menafrivac® of all subjects aged 1– <dig> years old was undertaken in the capital n’djamena and in the surrounding area in  <dig> with a dramatic impact on the epidemic, which continued in the rest of the country  <cit> . vaccination of all previously unvaccinated areas the following year ended the epidemic and few cases of meningitis have been recorded since  <cit> . the menafricar consortium, established in  <dig> to study the carriage of nm before and after the introduction of menafrivac® in the african meningitis belt, undertook three carriage surveys in the mandelia district of chad, two before and one after the vaccination campaign  <cit> . carriage of nma was low  prior to vaccination but fell to almost zero following vaccine implementation  <cit> .

isolates from serogroup a carriers and from patients with serogroup a invasive disease were retained, providing an opportunity to compare the genomic characteristics of carried and invasive isolates obtained during the same nma african epidemic. here we describe the high-resolution provided by whole genome sequence  analysis and demonstrate how this can identify differences among closely related isolates. no systematic clustering by carried or invasive phenotype was observed, but three distinct clusters were identified circulating during the  <dig> chadian epidemic, two of them preferentially isolated from different age groups.

RESULTS
genome assembly statistics
high-quality draft genomes  <cit>  were obtained for each isolate . in summary: the average number of contigs was  <dig> , the average n <dig> was  <dig> ; and the average length of the assembled genome was  <dig> . the average number of genes with allele designations, based on the  <dig> neisseria core genes list  <cit> , was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  loci.

rmlst analysis
higher resolution relationships were obtained through the comparisons of the  <dig> ribosomal mlst  loci, which identified six new rsts: rst-8263; rst-8296; rst-8303; rst-8311; rst-8323; and rst- <dig>  the nma genomes from chad exhibited allelic variation in  <dig> to  <dig> rmlst loci in pairwise comparisons, with an average of  <dig>  loci different. phylogenetic comparison with other nma:cc <dig> isolates, available through pubmlst.org/neisseria  <cit>  , was performed including isolates from: a global collection of nm isolates   <cit> ; the african meningitis belt   <cit> ; and other publically available isolates   <cit> . the neighbor-joining tree generated showed that most of the chadian  <dig> nma  formed a distinct branch ; however, two isolates were found to cluster separately with a bootstrap value of a  <dig> . isolates most closely related to the  <dig> chadian nma isolates were from south africa, niger, bangladesh, usa and burkina faso, between  <dig> and  <dig> and exhibited several rsts .fig.  <dig> rmlst neighbor-joining tree of cc <dig> nma. the relationship from the concatenated nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal genes between the nma isolates from chad  and other publically available cc <dig> nma genomes from the pubmlst database is represented in this tree. the label on each node indicates: the pubmlst id number, the country, the date and the rst for each isolate represented. a total of  <dig> other cc <dig> nma isolates were found in pubmlst but only one representative of each unique strain  was included in the tree alongside all the chadian nma from the  <dig> meningitis epidemic; the full list of publically available cc <dig> nma isolates is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the seven-locus mlst profiles of the isolates are indicated by different colored boxes. the position of the reference genome used in this study  is represented by a black star

differences among clusters
as cluster  <dig> comprised only two invasive isolates from the same geographical location it was not included in further statistical analysis. a significant difference in the mean age of the individuals from whom the nma were isolated was observed between clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  with cluster  <dig> exhibiting a mean age of  <dig>  years and cluster  <dig> a mean age of  <dig>  years, p =  <dig> . no significant difference between the clusters was found for the gender or residence of individuals from whom the meningococci were isolated. cluster-specific allelic differences were identified in nine loci for cluster  <dig> and  <dig> loci for cluster  <dig>  these allelic differences included non-synonymous mutations  in seven genes. in cluster  <dig>  four of the nsms led to changes in the chemical properties of the encoded amino acids  and similarly, in cluster  <dig> with six nsms. in both clusters most of these genes were annotated as encoding components of metabolic pathways, however, this included enzymes, genes associated with antibiotic resistance, toxicity, and genetic information processing .table  <dig> genes with alleles specific to cluster  <dig> isolates

whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis of non-coding regions
wgsnp comparison of the  <dig> nma genomes from chad and the wue <dig> reference genome identified  <dig> snps using assembled fasta sequences as input files, with  <dig> snps identified when raw fastq files were used. neighbor net trees  generated from the snp matrix had a similar topology to those generated by wgmlst analysis .

using the annotations from the finished genome, wue <dig>  enabled coding-regions, which had been included in wgmlst analysis, to be distinguished from non-coding regions, as well as other regions not found in the reference genome. there were  <dig> snps  and  <dig> snps  identified in non-coding regions: the majority of them  <dig>  and  <dig>  discriminated between the reference genome and the  <dig> chadian nma;  <dig> snps were specific to cluster 3;  <dig> snps were specific to cluster  <dig> and  <dig> were specific to cluster  <dig> by both methods. within those  <dig> snps, only  <dig> were specific to the whole cluster 1; a total of nine snps grouped six isolates , three snps were specific to two isolates  and one snp was specific to the four carried isolates . the other snps were unique, with  <dig> specific to pubmlst id:  <dig> by both methods . the snp specific to the four carried isolates sub-cluster was mapped to a non-coding region between neis <dig> and neis1545; an alignment of that region from all isolates of cluster  <dig> allowed the identification of a nucleotide change from a g to an a,  <dig> base pairs upstream of the start codon of neis <dig> 

discussion
in the absence of comprehensive vaccines, meningococcal meningitis epidemics remain a serious threat to public health in the african meningitis belt and elsewhere. understanding the transition from the carried to the invasive phenotype will contribute to improved preventive measures in both epidemic and non-epidemic periods. the simultaneous collection of carried and invasive isolates during the  <dig> epidemic in chad enabled the comparison of closely related isolates obtained in the same temporal and geographic sampling frame. such genomic comparisons rely on the availability of comprehensive collections of isolates, which are difficult to obtain and access from countries of the african meningitis belt. for example, isolate storage requires a −80 °c freezer with a reliable electricity supply. while all of the chadian isolates were appropriately stored at −80 °c at the national reference laboratory of n’djamena, the recovery rate was very low, perhaps a consequence of delays in the samples reaching the laboratory and/or difficulties in maintaining storage temperatures. the invasive isolates were mainly sourced from different areas around the capital n’djamena, whilst the carried isolates were all obtained in the district of mandelia, situated about 65 km away from n’djamena . the carriage study involved an age-stratified randomly selected proportion of the population of the study area and so were likely to be representative of those circulating in the community  <cit> , whilst only a small proportion of disease cases were investigated microbiologically  <cit> ; nevertheless, these samples offer comparisons of meningococci from disease and carriage in the same region at the same time.

all of the nma isolates belonged to the hyper-invasive, pandemic, st- <dig> clonal complex , with rmlst analysis placing the chadian epidemic nma in the context of  <dig> other publically available nma:cc <dig> isolates , dating from  <dig> to  <dig> and from five continents allowing a global representation of nma:cc <dig>  this confirmed the close genetic relatedness of members of this complex  <cit> , but the clustering within cc <dig> was not entirely congruent with time and place. for example, the chadian isolates occupied two different branches: one including the majority of isolates , comprised of  <dig> different rsts; the other comprising the two remaining isolates with two different rsts . these isolates did not cluster with other meningococci from the african meningitis belt; however, a global distribution of cc <dig> sub-variants spanning several years was apparent with isolates from bangladesh, usa, and south africa clustering with chadian meningococci and isolates from niger or burkina.

chadian isolates were present on branches of the phylogeny that were distinct from those which included the st- <dig> and st- <dig> nma isolates from ghana and burkina faso, which have also been analyzed at the whole genome level  <cit> , highlighting the need for the additional resolution obtained by rmlst in epidemiological studies  <cit> . the two isolates from cluster  <dig> were more distantly related, as were the two chinese isolates, indicating that this relatively small sample contained much of the diversity seen in publically available isolates from different locations. the previous study  <cit>  noted potentially significant changes between st- <dig> and st- <dig> nma isolates at:  the pgl locus, involved in glycosylation mechanisms;  pilus regulation associated genes; and  the maf <dig> locus. in the chad isolates, which were mostly st- <dig>  cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> shared the same alleles as the ghanaian st- <dig> isolates at the pgld, pglc and pglb locus: cluster  <dig> had a different allele which may represent the acquisition of deoxyribonucleic acid  from another source by homologous genetic transfer. the pglh locus was located at the beginning or the end of a contig in the majority of the draft genomes obtained and consequently its diversity could not be assessed in this analysis. the pilus genes were also variable in the chad isolates but their variation did not correlate with the clusters identified. on the other hand, all the chadian isolates shared the same maf <dig> alleles as the ghanaian st- <dig> isolates. whole genome comparison of the nma:cc <dig> isolates clearly showed that the chadian isolates were distinct at multiple loci from the burkina faso and ghanaian isolates ; additional whole genome comparisons are required, however, to elucidate further differences between these two isolate collections.

this study is the first description of a meningococcus lacking the gdh gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, making it impossible to define its sequence type by seven-locus mlst and reiterating the usefulness of whole genome analysis. the deleted region also included loci encoding a 6-phosphogluconolactonase, a glucokinase, and pgi <dig>  which are involved in glucose metabolism. glucose being an essential source of energy for nm in blood and csf  <cit> , such an invasive isolate would be at a disadvantage during an infection. this deletion probably occurred during sub-cultivation and is unlikely to be of biological relevance.

whole genome gene-by-gene analysis identified three different nma clusters circulating during the epidemic in chad. isolates were very similar, with  <dig> % of the genes identical in all genomes and  <dig>  genes confirmed as variable. no clustering by disease phenotype was evident, with clusters  <dig> and  <dig> containing both disease and carried isolates in similar proportions, indicating that the invasive and carried isolates circulating during the epidemic were part of the same bacterial population. this was consistent with previous genomic comparisons among more diverse carried and disease isolates, which found no distinct monophyletic groups by gene content  <cit>  or snp analysis  <cit> .

previously proposed “virulence-associated” genes were not systematically clustered on the basis of disease phenotype  <cit>  among these isolates. within-cluster analysis identified two genes that had alterations specific to the four carried isolates of cluster 1: neis <dig> encodes a two-component response regulator member of the actr/rega family that is involved in signal transduction mechanism and transcription  <cit>  and neis <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function. the impact of these genetic mutations in the biological function of these bacteria would need to be assessed further.

the use of wgsnp analysis to detect nucleotide changes in non-coding regions that discriminated carried and invasive isolates identified  <dig> % of snps in non-coding regions . only one snp was found to discriminate carried from invasive isolates of cluster  <dig>  this snp was found within the proximal promoter region of the gene neis <dig>  which is known to include transcription regulatory elements, but is located away from the − <dig> and − <dig> region which are part of the core promoter required for initiation of transcription  <cit> ; additional analyses is necessary to determine the impact of this particular snp on the transcription of neis <dig>  the wgsnp neighbor net trees  showed identical phylogenetic clustering to that found with the wgmlst tree , with the same nodes; however, cluster  <dig> appeared to be more diverse than observed with wgmlst analysis. snps found in the non-coding regions specific to sub-clusters and single isolates within cluster  <dig> led to the observed diversity . the wgsnp analysis based on the assembled fasta file and the original fastq files gave similar results.

gene presence does not always correlate with expression and it is possible that despite both disease and carriage isolates possessing the same complement of genes, their expression levels might vary  <cit> . a study comparing two serogroup b nm  from different clonal complexes, a carried st-41/ <dig> isolate and an invasive st- <dig> isolate, identified eight putative virulence-associated genes missing or non-functional from the carried isolate and considerable differences in their expression patterns  <cit> . nm are highly variable bacteria and it is difficult to determine whether changes are due to the different phenotype or to inherent differences between the two clonal complexes. analyses with additional genomes from the same clonal complexes are therefore essential for such comparisons. the results of the wgsnp analysis did not identify any changes at the nucleotide sequence level that could predict a change in gene expression between the carried and invasive isolates of this study except for one snp found in the proximal promoter upstream of neis <dig> that differentiated carried and invasive isolates of cluster  <dig>  a study applying similar methods to those presented here compared  <dig> carried and invasive nmy collected in the uk between  <dig> and  <dig> with an overlapping collection of both phenotypes obtained only in  <dig>  as found in this study, clusters of isolates contained both carried and invasive isolates; however, these investigators were able to identify a disease-associated clone within their clonal complex  <dig> nmy, which included 90% of invasive isolates  <cit> .

the genetic differentiation between clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and their strong association with host age, may represent bacterial adaptation to a particular niche and the change in the ecology of the nasopharynx from children to young adults in chad. this is supported by the fact that most of the allelic variations found between the clusters were identified in metabolic genes . a previous study of the pharyngeal carriage of members of the neisseria genus found that there was an inverse relationship between carriage of nm and other non-pathogenic neisseria species by age group which indicate a potential role that other microbes may play in modulating nm carriage and could explain the age difference seen in this study  <cit> . further studies, similar to those undertaken on the gut microbiota  <cit> , might address this issue. dna microarray studies have identified a bacteriophage that was mostly found in genomes from the hyper-invasive clonal complexes  <cit> . this “meningococcal disease associated island”  phage is associated with disease in young adults  <cit> . the mda island genes were present in both clusters  <dig> and  <dig> with the same alleles and thus could not explain the differentiation seen in this collection of isolates. host genetic polymorphisms affecting the susceptibility of an individual to invasive meningococcal disease have been described, such as those in complement components such as factor h  <cit>  or c <dig> deficiencies known to vary depending on the racial group and described as more common in african-american in the usa  <cit> , interleukin- <dig> gene cluster  <cit>  or the plasminogen activator inhibitor  <dig>  <cit> . differences in host genetics could also explain our clusters; however, such studies have yet to be undertaken in african subjects.

CONCLUSIONS
during the epidemic in and around n’djamena, carriers and cases were infected by meningococci that were indistinguishable at the whole genome level, an observation which is consistent with host factors playing a major role in determining whether an infected person remains a carrier or becomes a case. potential factors include the ability of the host immune response to contain the meningococcus in the pharynx or to eliminate it rapidly if invasion does occur, an ability which is at least partly genetically determined  <cit> . gene expression among the isolates has not been directly compared in this work, and this may also play a role in the differentiation between carried and invasive isolates; one interesting snp was identified in this study, upstream of a gene encoding a hypothetical protein, both the snp and function of the gene should be investigated further to determine their role, if any, in meningococcal colonization and disease. in addition, it is possible that other bacteria within the pharyngeal microbiome influence the ability of a meningococcus to invade. further bacterial genetic and protein expression studies, microbiome and human genetic studies comparing carriers and cases from similar backgrounds would help elucidate the role played by each factor in isolation and understand their interactions and the mechanisms driving nm from a carried commensal to an invasive pathogen.
