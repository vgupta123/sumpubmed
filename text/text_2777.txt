BACKGROUND
genome sequencing has shown that gene copy number variation  occurs more often than expected. recently, a genome-wide examination of cnvs in humans revealed that many cnvs show linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . moreover, cnvs contribute to inter-individual variation in responses to drugs, immune defence, and susceptibility to certain diseases in humans and mice  <cit> . these findings suggest that variation in gene copy number is sometimes under selection and that it is one of the driving forces for evolution in these species. however, because these studies focused on certain human and mouse diseases, it is unclear whether cnvs and these features of cnvs are common phenomena in vertebrates.

threespine stickleback , which inhabits marine, brackish, and freshwaters of the northern hemisphere, is a classical model organism in ethology  <cit>  and has recently attracted attention because of the evolution of diverse morphological characters among populations  <cit> . this fish is also well known for its characteristic reproductive mode in which mature males build nests using a glue-like protein called "spiggin" to adhere materials to the nest  <cit> . there are multiple occurrences of genes that encode spiggin, suggesting the existence of an ancestral gene prior to the expansion of teleosts and the duplication of spiggin genes both before and after the speciation of threespine stickleback  <cit> . this implies a possible relationship between spiggin gene duplication and the stickleback's specific reproductive nest-building behavior.

it is unclear how many genes compose the spiggin multi-gene family  <cit> . in previous studies, spiggin gene sequences were characterized mainly based on cdna  <cit> , and information derived from genome sequences was not considered. the results of genomic southern analyses to estimate the number of spiggin genes differ among studies  <cit> . the genome sequence of threespine stickleback was recently published  <cit> , making it possible to determine the number of spiggin genes and conduct comparative genomic analyses. moreover, it may allow the exploration of the origin of and evolutionary processes occurring in the spiggin multi-gene family.

we aimed to resolve the spiggin multi-gene family in threespine stickleback and understand its origin and evolutionary processes. we isolated members of the spiggin multi-gene family from the threespine stickleback genome database and conducted phylogenetic and synteny analyses of these genes together with their homologs and related genes. we also performed molecular evolutionary analyses to examine the evolutionary forces that shaped the spiggin multi-gene family.

RESULTS
identification of the spiggin multi-gene family and homologs in genome sequences
we identified seven putative spiggin genes in linkage group  iv of the threespine stickleback genome sequence. no other spiggin related genes have been found in other regions, although the whole genome was searched exhaustively. the length of the region in lg iv that contained the entire spiggin multi-gene family was approximately  <dig> kbp . these genes were located tandemly in the same direction. we named these seven genes gaac_spg <dig> to gaac_spg <dig> . a relatively long intergenic region  was observed between the third and fourth spiggin genes  compared with the lengths of the other intergenic regions.

some of these spiggin genes had relatively high diversity in length and similarity. gaac_spg <dig>  gaac_spg <dig>  and gaac_spg <dig> were shorter than the other spiggin genes because a region corresponding to the posterior region of the other genes was truncated . although a rather high level of similarity was observed among the spiggin genes, gaac_spg <dig> had relatively low similarity with the other genes . low similarity was also found in the central region of gaac_spg <dig>  although the other regions of this gene had high similarity with the other copies . we examined the region of low sequence similarity in detail.

to examine the detailed differences in the spiggin gene sequences, we aligned all of the genes that were identified in this study . examination of the gaac_spg <dig> sequence indicated that the central region has been lost . even the regions that showed relatively high similarity with other spiggin genes had several indels, and some exon-intron boundaries were not conserved , suggesting that this gene has been disrupted. gaac_spg <dig> also contains several indels and mutations in the exon-intron boundaries , as well as a low-similarity region containing gc-rich regions , a repeated region , and a gap sequence that has not yet been sequenced . we amplified and sequenced the regions that contained indels to confirm that such features were not caused by sequencing errors . based on these results, we judged that gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> are pseudogenes and thus excluded them from further analyses.

the percent similarity was estimated among the putative orf regions of the remaining spiggin genes. high similarity was observed between gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> , gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> , and gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> . gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> were also highly similar . however, the similarities between the first three gene pairs  and the latter pair  were relatively low . the similarities among the translated amino acid sequences were all lower than the similarities among the nucleotide sequences, suggesting that there were more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions.

we identified one spiggin homolog in scaffold  <dig> of the medaka genome sequence. this scaffold is one of the shortest scaffolds  and assembled to none of the lgs of the medaka genome. combined with the results of a previous study  <cit> , this demonstrates the occurrence of a single spiggin homolog in four fish species: torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish.

we predicted the conserved domain structures of the translated sequences of the spiggin genes and the medaka spiggin homolog. all of the spiggins and the medaka spiggin homolog shared the von willebrand factor d domain  structure. except for the vwds, we could not identify any domains characteristic of the translated products of secreted mucin genes, muc <dig>  5ac, 5b, and  <dig>  which are suggested to be related to the spiggin genes  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of spiggin genes
phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the spiggin genes in threespine and ninespine sticklebacks and their homologs in other fishes . we used various data from the spiggin genes in threespine stickleback: spiggin genes isolated in the threespine stickleback genome sequence  and spiggin cdna sequences published in genbank . we also used spiggin genes from ninespine stickleback  and spiggin homologs isolated from the torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish genome sequences. no differences in topology among the analyses  were found. the tree derived from the maximum likelihood  analysis is shown .

in the phylogenetic analyses, the threespine stickleback spiggin genes  and the ninespine stickleback genes  formed a monophyletic group . the clade of threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin genes was divided into three subgroups: clade a, containing gaac_spg <dig>  gaac_spg <dig>  spg <dig>  and spg4; clade b, containing gaac_spg <dig>  gaac_spg <dig>  spg <dig>  spg <dig>  and ninespine stickleback spiggins ; and clade c, containing gaac_spg <dig> . clades a and b were most closely related, and clade c was basal . although it is not clear how many spiggin genes occur in ninespine stickleback, this result suggests that the spiggin genes diverged both before and after the divergence of threespine and ninespine sticklebacks.

when we focused on the genes from the threespine stickleback genome sequence , the phylogenetic relationships of the genes were not congruent with their chromosomal locations , indicating that the genes that showed close relationships in the phylogenetic tree were not necessarily located close to each other on the chromosome. thus, it was not possible to estimate the order of the gene duplication events based on the relative gene positions. spiggin genes isolated from the threespine stickleback genome sequence and those from cdna sequences did not show exact one-to-one corresponding relationships . corresponding relationships were found for only a few genes: gaac_spg <dig> + gaac_spg <dig> and spg <dig> in clade a, and gaac_spg <dig> and spg <dig> + spg <dig> in clade b .

gene structure
we estimated the gene structure of the spiggin genes in threespine stickleback. in the spiggin genes isolated from the genome sequence , the numbers and lengths of exons in the 5' region were diverse. the second exon of gaac_spg <dig> and the fifth exon of gaac_spg <dig> were absent, and the second exon of gaac_spg <dig> was  <dig> nucleotides shorter than that of the other genes . the length of introns also differed among the genes; introns in gaac_spg <dig> were longer than those in the other genes . in gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig>  exons in the posterior region were truncated, which was apparent in the dotplot analysis . when information about the putative exon-intron boundary in the threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin cdna sequences was taken into account, there was a tendency for spiggin genes in clade a to have similar exon-intron structures, whereas those in clade b had diversity in the length and the number of exons . although the gene structures of ninespine stickleback spiggins were unclear because only partial cdna sequences have been published, gaac_spg <dig> and gaac_spg <dig> had fewer exons than did the other genes, and spg <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained apparently untranscribed regions of the other genes. probable changes in the consensus sequences of the exon-intron boundary or terminal codon may have caused the elongation of the orf of these genes.

we also examined the gene structures of the spiggin gene homologs of other fishes. in the spiggin homologs of torafugu and spotted green pufferfish, the lengths and sequence similarities of exons were conserved. based on sequence similarity in some exons, spiggin homologs of medaka and zebrafish also seemed to conserve the basic exon-intron structure with spiggin genes of threespine stickleback, although reliable estimation of the orf region was difficult in these two species because of possible gaps in their genome sequence data. the lengths of introns were dramatically short in torafugu and spotted green pufferfish, whereas the homologs of medaka and zebrafish had very long introns .

detection of positive selection and gene recombination
we conducted an evolutionary analysis to examine the possibility that the threespine stickleback spiggin genes were under positive selection and obtained evidence of positive selection  in two subgroups: clades a and b . in clade b, the 140th amino acid residue was estimated to be under positive selection with a high posterior probability . although translated sequences of these genes conserved the vwd, which creates multimers with other molecules containing a vwd, the 140th amino acid residue was not located in this conserved region.

comparison of synteny
the chromosomal locations of the spiggin multi-gene family, its homologs, and their related genes were examined and compared among the species. spiggin genes or their homologs were located in lg iv , scaffold  <dig> , scaffold  <dig>  , scaffold  <dig> , and scaffold  <dig> . the chromosomal locations of all of these genes, except for those of threespine stickleback, are unknown because the scaffolds have not been annotated to a specific chromosome. in human and mouse, the chromosomal location of the secreted mucin gene family , which is thought to be related to the spiggin multi-gene family  <cit> , was examined. in human, muc <dig>  5ac, 5b, and  <dig> were located on the 11th chromosome as a cluster, whereas muc <dig> was located in the 12th chromosome. in mouse, muc <dig>  5ac, 5b, and  <dig> clustered on the 7th chromosome, whereas muc <dig> was located on the 15th chromosome. we also explored the genes around the spiggin multi-gene family, its homologs, and mucin genes in each species. although other genes were not identified in the scaffolds of medaka or zebrafish because of their shortness, some genes in the syntenic region were identified by virtue of the other species' synteny information . as a result, we found that torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish shared several genes around the spiggin gene homologs with threespine stickleback, as well as muc <dig> in human and mouse . these facts strongly suggest that spiggin and muc <dig> are orthologous. in contrast, the cluster of muc2/5ac/5b/ <dig> and muc <dig> did not share any genes around them, suggesting a paralogous relationship between them.

discussion
spiggin gene repertoire in threespine stickleback
there are at least five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes in the threespine stickleback genome sequence. however, spiggin genes from the genome sequence  and those from cdna  did not show one-to-one correspondence . although these two types of spiggin gene are derived from different sources, they should show corresponding relationships because they were sequenced from a single species. the spiggin cdnas  are extremely unlikely to contain alleles at spiggin loci because of their sequence diversity .

one possible reason for the absence of such correspondence is that the two populations used for sequencing are highly differentiated genetically. a population in bear paw lake, alaska, usa, was used for the genome project  <cit> . the population used for cdna sequencing was from the pacific ocean group in eastern hokkaido, japan  <cit> . allozyme and snp analyses show that they are genetically distinct populations  <cit> . in addition, our results suggest the possibility of population-specific evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family. gene duplication/deletion, amino acid replacement, and gene conversion may have occurred independently in each stickleback population . to confirm this possibility, further study of the genome sequence of the pacific ocean group is necessary.

origin and evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family
our previous phylogenetic analyses using partial amino acid sequences of the conserved domain structure suggested that the muc <dig> gene is most closely related to the spiggin multi-gene family; phylogenetic analyses using full length spiggin/mucin genes could not be made because of high gene diversity  <cit> . we confirmed this hypothesis through the analysis of the chromosome location and synteny of the spiggin and related gene families of various vertebrate species. thus, we conclude that spiggin genes originated from members of the mucin gene family. translated spiggin gene products are high-molecular-mass glycoproteins that constitute glue-like proteins  <cit> ; translated mucin gene products are also high-molecular-mass glycoproteins that represent major components of mucus-like substances  <cit> . this similarity clearly reflects the orthologous relationships of these genes.

five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes were observed in the threespine stickleback genome sequence, and three types of spiggin genes have been identified in ninespine stickleback. in contrast, muc <dig> is a single-copy gene in human and mouse, and a single spiggin homolog was found in fishes other than sticklebacks. these facts and the results of our phylogenetic analysis imply that the ancestral spiggin gene existed as a single gene in the ancestral fish lineage, and duplications of the spiggin gene occurred both before and after the divergence of threespine and ninespine sticklebacks .

spiggin mrna is found in the kidney in threespine stickleback  <cit> . however, muc <dig> mrna is found in the submaxillary gland in human and mouse  <cit> . thus, the expression pattern of the ancestral spiggin gene may have changed after the divergence of tetrapods and fishes. in human, secretory mucin genes other than muc <dig>  are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene by two successive duplications  <cit> . these mucin genes show both spatially  <cit>  and temporally specific expression patterns  <cit> . it is clear that these genes were neofunctionalized after the gene duplications. a recent study also showed lineage-specific gene duplication of the mucin gene family in chicken and found that the additional gene encodes ovomucin, which is abundant in egg white and responsible for its gel-like properties  <cit> . these findings show that expression pattern shifts and gains of new function have occurred repeatedly following gene duplication in the mucin gene family in various vertebrate lineages.

we examined the expression of spiggin homologs in torafugu and zebrafish. although we did not find expression in any of the zebrafish tissues examined, we did find kidney-specific expression in male and female torafugu . in threespine stickleback, spiggin genes are expressed only in the kidneys of mature males, and translated products of spiggin are secreted as a glue in male nest building  <cit> . such a glue-like protein produced in the kidney has not been reported in torafugu. this implies that the function of spiggin should differ between threespine stickleback and torafugu. the shifts in expression and gain of new function as a glue may have occurred in the spiggin gene family in sticklebacks in a fashion similar to the mucin gene family in human or ovomucin in chicken. of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that mutation events in regulatory regions of these genes, which could cause such divergent expression, also occurred in spiggins of other fish lineages. further expression and functional analyses will explore the detailed evolutionary processes of the spiggin multi-gene family in threespine stickleback.

background of the evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family
our results demonstrate that the spiggin multi-gene family of threespine stickleback is localized in a cluster. in general, such repeated genes can be divided into two types: variant and invariant repeats  <cit> . variant repeats are copies of a gene that differ in sequence from the original, and sometimes can perform markedly different functions  <cit> . invariant repeats are gene copies with identical or nearly identical sequences, which can result in the synthesis of large quantities of gene product  <cit> .

although it is reasonable to hypothesize that spiggin genes are invariant repeats because a large amount of glue is required for nest building, considerable diversity was observed in their sequences. the existence of many nonsynonymous substitutions in the sequences confirmed that this multi-gene family is constructed of variant repeats. our evolutionary analysis suggests that diversifying evolution occurred by positive darwinian selection, rather than the random fixation of neutral mutations.

adaptive evolution to the local environment seems to exist in the background of the evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family. there are distinct wild populations of threespine stickleback that have morphological, behavioral, and physiological differences. various characters in each population may have evolved to match the local environment; one character is nest-building behavior  <cit> . during nest building, a glue-like protein is used to adhere materials to the nest  <cit> . to maximize its function, the character of the glue should be adapted to the local environment . the spiggin multi-gene family might have evolved in conjunction with the adaptation of the glue-like protein to various environments.

nest-building behavior might also be under sexual selection by females because this behavior is an important component of reproduction. mature females are more attracted to males with decorated nests than to males with undecorated nests  <cit> . moreover, the relative weight of a nest building male's kidney, which secretes the glue-like protein, is positively correlated with nest characters such as neatness or compactness  <cit> , which may reflect male quality. because mature males use the glue-like protein in nest building, spiggin genes may have also evolved under sexual selection.

CONCLUSIONS
five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes were identified in the threespine stickleback genome sequence and single-copy spiggin homologs were found in other fishes. in addition, muc <dig>  a single-copy gene in human and mouse, was demonstrated to be a putative ortholog of spiggin. these results suggest that the ancestral spiggin gene originated from the mucin gene family as a single-copy gene and that subsequent gene duplication events occurred before and after threespine stickleback speciation. we also suggest a complex evolutionary trajectory of the spiggin multi-gene family, including positive selection after duplication events in stickleback populations. further study of additional threespine stickleback populations will demonstrate population-specific evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family in detail and may provide insight into the evolutionary forces shaping the gene family. the dramatic evolution of genes such as mucin or the spiggin multi-gene family that encode mucous substrates may have helped to generate the characteristic of "bio-glue" in vertebrates.
