BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small 20- <dig> nucleotide  noncoding rnas that mediate translational repression by binding to mir recognition elements  found in the 3'utr of their mrna targets  <cit> . the most critical region for binding and repression of mrna by a mir are positions 2- <dig> of the mre, referred to as the seed site. although there are examples of mirs targeting mrnas without perfect watson-crick complementarity to the mre seed site , a collection of evidence supports the mress as the most important feature for prediction and function. in some cases single 7mer seed sites are sufficient for a mir to repress translation, and ex-vivo experiments have shown single point mutations in the mress may reduce effectiveness or abolish mir mediated repression  <cit> . further highlighting the importance of this sequence, it has been demonstrated that a higher degree of negative selection occurs within predicted conserved mresss compared to conserved non mress control sites  <cit> . given the importance of the mress, it has been proposed that single nucleotide polymorphisms  mapping within the mress, or which create novel mress , may have functional consequences resulting in phenotypic variation  <cit> . moreover, snps that create or abrogate mresss may modulate gene transcript and protein levels relevant to a phenotype of interest, generally, or under the influence of particular environmental conditions.

it has long been thought that disease causing variants act through alteration of exon sequence resulting in altered protein function. however, snps may also act to modulate gene expression, and this has been demonstrated for many promoter snps in which the risk allele alters the affinity of a transcription factor to its binding motif  <cit> . furthermore, several published examples show functional variants in mres that modulate risk for a variety of disease states, such as breast cancer, tourette's syndrome, and hypertension among others  <cit> . two studies have demonstrated a gene by environment interaction where a mress snp modulates individual response to drug and dietary intakes  <cit> . a survey of the frequency of predicted and validated mress snps, identified an appreciable number of snps falling within mres across the human genome  <cit> . however, the number of risk alleles identified with plausible mechanisms for modulation of gene expression is outweighed by snps falling in gene desert regions  <cit> . it could be that these snps fall within distant but bona fide enhancer or suppressor elements resulting in the modulation of gene expression, as was demonstrated for the variant within the 8q <dig> gene desert and its effects on tp <dig> expression in prostate  <cit> . alternatively, it may be these snps are in ld with variants not yet identified or available on gwas chips. for example, sequencing of the hla-c 3'utr revealed a snp modulating an mre for the binding of mir- <dig>  furthermore, this snp was shown to be in ld with rs <dig> which is found  <dig> kb upstream of hla-c and associates with control of hiv  <cit> . these data demonstrated that rs <dig> is a marker for a functional snp that was not contained in commercial snp arrays. further underscoring this point, recent chromatin studies have identified novel non-coding gene regulatory regions, some of which contain top scoring hits for disease associating snps  <cit> .

currently over  <dig> human mir sequences are reported in the mirbase catalog  <cit> . estimates suggest that over 30% of human protein-coding genes are regulated by mirs, and that each mir may potentially regulate hundreds of target transcripts  <cit> . given this large number of potential mir targets in the human genome, identifying allele-specific mir-mrna interactions may help elucidate functional roles for a portion of the many snps identified in genome wide association studies  that lack obvious functionality.

with such information in mind, one aim of the  <dig> genomes project is to catalog over 95% of human variation in order to inform association studies of all potential causal snps  <cit> . furthermore, initial studies in the  <dig> genomes pilot indicated that a substantial number of variants are in ld with known disease markers and that these variants are not well covered on commercial arrays. importantly, the data currently available in the  <dig> genomes project provides unprecedented access to millions of snps, some of which may elucidate functional mechanisms for the many risk alleles identified in gwas.

here we have performed a genome-wide survey for snps falling within both experimentally validated and computationally predicted conserved mresss, by utilizing these data   <cit> . in addition to this analysis, we have surveyed these data for predicted cnm snps. furthermore, we have examined all snps identified in gwas for functional variants in relation to predicted mresss and cnm snps using the data from the  <dig> genomes project. combing with several other publically available data sources, we identified numerous mress snps as possible modulators of disease relevant phenotypes. our work demonstrates the utility of the data generated from the  <dig> genomes project and provides insight into the frequency and relevance of mre snps in human disease and may provide some clues regarding environmentally driven human selection.

RESULTS
approximately 5% of validated mres contain snps in their seed site
to assess the frequency of snps falling in validated mresss, we first determined the genomic dna  coordinates of  <dig> validated mrna target seed-sites for all mrna-mir interactions, from the mirecords database  <cit> . for a site to be included in this list we required functional evidence for the target site . we searched each reported validated site for  <dig> classes of "canonical" seed sites. here we define canonical seed sites as having, at least, perfect pairing among seed site positions 2- <dig>  in addition to three other classes with binding site characteristics at positions  <dig> or  <dig>  demonstrated to improve likelihood of repression; 8mer , 7mer-8m , and 7-mer-a <dig>   <cit> . we then determined if the gdna coordinates of all 3'utr snps  fell within the gdna coordinates of each validated mress from above. we identified  <dig> snps  that lie in validated mresss corresponding to  <dig> target transcripts .

a list comprising  <dig> validated mres  in which a snp has been identified. the coordinates column provides the chromosomal number and position coordinates for each snps - all genomic coordinates correspond to hg <dig>  the maf column reports the allele frequency of the minor allele from the population where it was highest, where na indicates a snp with unknown allele frequency. the pos in mre column refers to the position within the mre to which the snp maps. * snps reported to have shown association with disease phenotypes.

no population frequency data are available for 29% of the mre snps , a value that will change as whole genome sequence data from more individuals surface and with completion of more encompassing gwas studies. nine snps have minor allele frequencies  < = 2%, and may be considered rare in the general population and therefore unlikely as common factors in complex disease. the  <dig> remaining snps have allele frequencies above 2% in at least one population listed in dbsnp . of note,  <dig> of the  <dig>  snps identified have shown association with disease traits, emphasizing the potential importance of mress snps as modulators of disease risk.

previous studies have estimated mress snp density to be lower than that observed in regions outside the mress, suggesting a higher rate of negative selection on mress  <cit> . in light of the updated account of variation in the human genome available in dbsnp build <dig>  we estimated the frequency of snps falling within mress and those falling outside of mresss using the  <dig> sequences from validated target sites identified from the above analysis. we performed a sliding window search of  <dig> bases,  starting  <dig> bases upstream and continuing to  <dig> bases downstream of each validated mre site, sliding at a  <dig> base step. the  <dig> mark of the x-axis in figure  <dig> demarcates the second position of the mress . our data indicate that the mress contains the lowest amount of variation across the region, an observation in agreement with prior analyses  <cit> . although there is less variation across the mresss there appears a considerable density of snps  falling within what is thought to be the most important sequence for mir-mrna interactions.

genome wide survey of predicted mress and cnm snps
although many variants have been associated with the modulation of phenotypes relevant to disease in gwas studies, the challenge of determining which of them may be casual remains  <cit> . to identify potential causal variants mediated by mress creation or disruption we first performed a genome-wide survey for snps falling within computationally predicted conserved mresss. to do this, we utilized the http://microrna.org portal to access a collection of predicted mir-mrna interactions. these predictions were derived using an algorithm that incorporates an array of the most recent mir prediction guidelines, such as seed-site pairing, site context, free-energy, and target conservation across multiple vertebrates  <cit> . we focused our analysis on mresss conserved across mammals as these are more likely to be of functional significance   <cit> . by comparing the gdna coordinates of each predicted mress against the gdna coordinates of dbsnp <dig> snps, we identified  <dig> mress snps interrupting  <dig> conserved predicted interactions. to further prioritize these hits, we classified them by the type of seed match the mress snp was predicted to interrupt; 8mer , 7mer-8m , 7-mer-a <dig>  or 6mer . although there is overlap in the degree of efficiency of repression by these different seed type classes , there remains a hierarchy with 8mer sites being most efficient  <cit> . interestingly 38%  of mress snps fall within predicted 8mer mresss. it has been estimated that ~50% of predicted mres are potentially functional and it is likely that a portion of the snps identified here fall within bona fide mres  <cit> . overall, we estimate that 3% of high confidence predicted conserved mresss contain snps.

in addition to snps that may interrupt mresss, snp alleles may also create mresss. to identify potential cnm snps we performed a genome-wide computational survey for predicted mresss that are created when the mrna sequence contains the non-reference allele of hg <dig>  using the ensembl variation api tools we retrieved the flanking  <dig> nt sequence from both upstream and downstream of the non-reference allele of every 3'utr dbsnp <dig> snp. each sequence containing the non-reference allele was analyzed for potential mir-target sites using the miranda software  <cit> . this analysis provided us with  <dig> cnm snp creating  <dig> mir-mrna predictions which where also categorized by the seed-type they created; 8mer , 7mer-8m , and 7-mer-a <dig>  or 6mer . it should be noted that there are many more predictions for cnm than mress snps. this is due to the fact that no conservation constraint was imposed on the cnm snp predictions . considering that many cnm snps presumably arise to create new regulatory sites, filtering our hits on conservation status would be counter-intuitive. of note, we found that approximately 28%  of predicted mress and cnm snps identified here were first identified by the  <dig> genomes project.

some snps identified in gwas are in ld with predicted conserved mress and cnm snps
gwas have been a powerful approach to identify genetic variants that contribute to disease risk. however, a functional role for many of the snps identified has not been elucidated. it is likely some of these snps are in strong ld with unknown functional ones, some of which could be among the predicted conserved mress and cnm snps. to investigate this possibility, we searched the resulting mress and cnm snp data for variants in ld with snps showing association, of gwas significance, with disease traits and related phenotypes. to do so, we retrieved a dataset of  <dig> reported associations, collected from gwas studies, between  <dig> unique snps and disease traits shown to have p-values meeting a threshold of <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  <cit> . these data were processed through snap http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearch.php which yielded a list of snps  in ld with those reported in the gwas. we limited our search to an r <dig> of >  <dig>  for the ceu population. the results of this query were searched against both the mress snp and the cnm snp predictions. this query identified  <dig> instances of an mress snp , in ld  with a least one reported gwas snp or an original gwas snp, associating with disease phenotypes . in total there were  <dig> mress snps in  <dig> genes associating with  <dig> traits. we also identified  <dig> instances of a gwas snp that associates with disease traits and is in ld  with cnm snps . there were  <dig> cnm snps in  <dig> genes associating with  <dig> traits.

in total we identified  <dig> snps  in very strong ld with snps reported as associating with disease related phenotypes. these  <dig> snps represent  <dig> % of the total unique snps reported in the gwas data. using the snap pairwise ld tool we determined that  <dig> of the  <dig> gwas snps are in ld with each other, giving us  <dig> snps or regions associating with disease traits. to determine the possibility of this number occurring by chance we first filtered dbsnp  <dig> for snps having a minor allele frequency  > = 1%, which was the lowest maf reported in the gwas data. we next selected randomly  <dig> snps and, as we did with the gwas data, ran them through snap to determine the snps in ld. from this list we determined the number of snps found in our mress and cnm snp data, and this analysis was repeated  <dig> times. from these  <dig> simulations the mean number of snps found in the mress and cnm snp data was  <dig>  and the standard deviation  <dig> . the probability of finding  <dig> snps by chance based on this distribution was calculated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  these snps may be considered the likely putative functional variants which represent proxy snps identified by gwas.

co-expression data identify functional candidates
support for a prediction of a mir regulating an mrna target is strongly lent by co-expression of both rnas. therefore, to further refine this list of  <dig> cases where a snp is predicted to create or abrogate a mress and be in ld with a gwas snp, we searched for evidence of co-expression of the mir and mrna using the mimir web tool  <cit> . in addition, we also searched the biomedical literature using the pubmed database with the terms of mir name and "expression." to search for mrna expression in the cognate tissue we queried the ncbi geoprofiles. these queries revealed mir-mrna co-expression evidence for  <dig> of the  <dig> snp predictions consisting of  <dig> mress snps and  <dig> cnm snps. table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> indicate the number of tissues in which there is evidence for co-expression between mir and mrna for which the snp is predicted to modulate an interaction.

all minor allele frequencies  reported are for the ceu pilot panel of the  <dig> genomes project, except where indicted. abbreviations: pid = pubmed accession, svr = mirsvr score, phastcon = conservation score, s-t = seed type. co = the number of cell and tissue samples in the mimirna database for which co-expression of mir and mrna were found. eqtl = reports available eqtl data in the muther study, where f = -fat cell biopsy , l = lcl cells , and s = skin cell biopsy .

eqtl data support several mre target predictions when a mress or cnm snp is present
variation in gene transcript levels is thought to be an important modulator of disease risk in humans and snps that may mediate this variation are thought to be of great functional significance  <cit> . to investigate the contribution of snps associating with disease traits to transcript level variation, a number of expression quantitative trait loci  studies have been performed  <cit> . these results have demonstrated a number of snps associating significantly with expression differences across collected tissue samples. importantly, these studies have noted differences in the amount of transcript variation across tissue samples, suggesting snps may modulate regulatory mechanisms, in some cases, in a tissue specific manner  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study has estimated that > 80% of mirs act to lower mrna levels demonstrating mrna destabilization is the primary mode of action of mirs on target mrnas  <cit> .

to determine if the  <dig> mir predictions with co-expression data identified in the previous section are supported by eqtl data we utilized the genevar eqtl database web tool  <cit> . genevar allows for querying and visualization of eqtl data for loci of interest using data from various studies. we utilized the results from the recent muther study which reports eqtl data from twin pairs in  <dig> tissue types;  <dig> twin-pair lymphoblastoid cell line  biopsies,  <dig> twin-pair skin cell biopsies and  <dig> twin-pair fat cell biopsies  <cit> . searching for eqtl data on each of the  <dig> mress and cnm snps we found  <dig> of the  <dig> had genotype specific transcript level data in at least one of the  <dig> tissue samples investigated in the muther study for which there was also evidence of co-expression in mimir for this tissue. four of these  <dig> snps showed marginally significant trends in the differences in transcript levels across genotypes .

sys <dig> transcript levels were shown to be significantly different among rs <dig> genotypes from lcl in one of the two twin study groups . although, the second twin group failed to achieve significance, the direction of the effect was in agreement with the first group. furthermore, the lower transcript levels associate with the allele predicted to create the mir- <dig> binding site. neither of the two twin adipose tissue sample groups for gfod <dig> transcript levels showed a significant difference among rs <dig> genotypes. interestingly, both p-values are of nominal significance and the direction of the effect supports the predicted mir interaction and subsequent effect of the cnm snp . ikzf <dig> transcript levels measured in lcl cells showed significant differences among the rs <dig> genotypes in both twin groups. lower ikzf <dig> levels were observed in carriers of the g allele which is predicted to create a mir- <dig> mress. however, a second probe found on the illumina whole genome expression array, used in the study, shows conflicting data where there is no difference between transcript levels in either group. the rs <dig> snp in the zc3h <dig> 3'utr shows no significant difference in transcript levels between alleles in adipose samples used in the muther study. however, literature mining for "eqtl, " and the corresponding gene and phenotype identified an additional study showing eqtl data that supports an allelic difference, in the correct direction, and in adipose tissue for rs <dig>  <cit> . taken together, this information suggests these four snps may have functional significance.

mress and cnm snps in positive selection
genetic variants that have been subject to selection are most likely the functional variants  <cit> . the fixation index  statistic measures population differentiation and provides a test for the influence of selective pressures, where higher fst values indicate local positive adaptation and lower values negative or neutral selection  <cit> . as adaptive genetic variants have been driven to higher frequencies by environmental factors , snps showing high fst values may be considered high priority candidates for association studies for gene by environment studies. such variants also may play a role in the observed variation and potentially influence disease prevalence across populations  <cit> . to determine if the identified 3'utr snps that create or disrupt predicted mresss may be under positive selection we first downloaded genome wide fst calculations for hapmap phase  <dig> data  <cit> . we found a significant difference  between the mean transformed fst values of combined mress and cnm snps  and the remaining  3'utr snps  for which fst data were available. figure  <dig> shows the number of fst values between mress and cnm snps and non-mre snps across  <dig> fst bins. as fst values increase there is a clear increase in mress and cnm snps compared to the remainder. this observation further supports that mress and cnm snps are likely functional variants.

to identify fst outliers we selected all snps falling  <dig> standard deviations  or more from the mean . in total,  <dig> mress or cnm snps were identified falling  <dig> sds from the mean. among these is the gfod <dig> snp, rs <dig>  for which we show evidence of co-expression and eqtl effect.

CONCLUSIONS
in the work presented here, we utilized the latest release of dbsnp, including the  <dig> genomes project data, to perform a genome-wide scan of human variation within validated and predicted mir binding sites, our hypothesis being that genetic variants at mir binding sites are functional, and important contributors to phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. we have taken careful measures to assign snps as creating or altering mir-mrna interactions. we identified  <dig> instances of a snp falling within a conserved predicted mress based on stringent filtering of conservation and interaction scores predicted by betel et al  <cit> . interestingly, 38% of these predicted disruptions were identified in 8mer target predictions. 8mer target sites have been shown to have the highest efficacy of target repression and therefore are considered higher priority predictions than those with lesser complimentarity  <cit> . overall, we estimate that 3% of predicted conserved mresss contain snps. our analysis also identified  <dig> instances of a snp creating an mress. given that no conservation restraint was utilized for identification of these cnm snps, we must be cautious for it is likely many of them are potential false positives. we also determined that  <dig> of the mress and cnm snps identified are in ld with snps identified in gwas. we demonstrate that  <dig> % of gwas snps are, or are in ld with, mress or cnm snps. however, this may be a conservative estimate, given that 1) we limited our snp selection based on conservation and other strict cutoffs, 2) the catalog of gwas snps investigated is not all encompassing 3) that these gwas studies do not consider gene by environment interactions and 4) ld estimates only cover snps up to the  <dig> genomes project pilot study  <dig> data.

recently, it has been demonstrated that snps previously identified in gwas are in ld with snps found in enhancer motifs regulating gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, other studies have linked snps falling in gene regulatory motifs, and not found on commercial snp arrays, to be in ld with top scoring gwas hits  <cit> . in a similar fashion, we suggest that many of the snps found in this study to be in ld with gwas snps may have functional significance. to further explore this possibility we utilized several publicly available data sets and tools and showed  <dig> of these  <dig> variants found to have evidence of co-expression of target mrna and the predicted mir. we found that four snps from this list have supporting eqtl data demonstrating variation in transcripts between alleles.

our analyses have identified four snps predicted to modulate allele-specific mir-mrna interactions which are supported by co-expression and eqtl data. the rs <dig> snp falls in the izkf <dig> transcript and is in ld  with eight snps associating with increased risk for a variety of autoimmune diseases. izkf <dig> is a transcription factor important for b-cell activation, and mice lacking this gene develop a lupus like syndrome, suggesting a role for izkf <dig> in autoimmunity  <cit> . the rs <dig> minor t allele is predicted to create a cnm for mir- <dig>  there is evidence for expression of mir- <dig> and izkf <dig> in human b-lymphocytes. interestingly, mir- <dig> is important for t-cell differentiation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune multiple sclerosis  <cit> . a study investigating transcript levels between the t and c alleles of rs <dig> in a lymphoblastoid cell line  demonstrate significantly lower levels of izkf <dig> in subjects carrying the t allele  <cit> . these data suggest that carriers of the t allele may have reduced levels of izkf <dig>  in part through mir- <dig> 

in addition the minor allele of rs <dig> is predicted to create an mre for mir-502-3p within the zc3h <dig> transcript and associates with bmi. zc3h <dig> is a poorly characterized zinc finger protein. there is eqtl evidence supporting this prediction where minor allele carriers have reduced zc3h <dig> expression compared to non-carriers, in adipose tissue  <cit> . both mir-502-3p and zc3h <dig> are expressed in adipose  <cit> . the rs <dig> snp, predicted to create an mre for mir- <dig> in the sys <dig> transcript, is in perfect ld with rs <dig> a snp associating with psoriasis  <cit> . the mre-creating allele of sys <dig> is also associated with lower sys <dig> transcript levels in lcl cells  <cit> . while a role for sys <dig> in immune function could not be found in the literature, it is known that mir- <dig> is involved in the immune response  <cit> . the rs <dig> snp is found in the poorly characterized glucose-fructose oxidoreductase domain containing  <dig>  transcript showing association with hdl-c  <cit> . our analysis predicts that the minor allele of rs <dig> creates a cnm for mir-125a-3p and that it is associated with reduced gfod <dig> levels. interestingly, both rnas are expressed in adipose tissue  <cit> . further, we identify rs <dig> as an fst outlier suggesting this snp may be undergoing population specific selection.

in addition to these four snps, we identified  <dig> others with data indicating co-expression with the predicted target mrna and these should be considered as candidates for functional studies. of these  <dig> candidates, a snp within the hoxb <dig> loci has shown eqtl peaks identified from lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> . while our analysis has generated many mress and cnm snp predictions for which no mir expression data are available, it is likely that as more mir expression and eqtl data become accessible, particularly for different cell types and specific conditions, many of these snps could be seen as functionally relevant. recent data indicate some mirs may act intracellularly, carried by hdl particles to recipient cells  <cit> . therefore, it may be that co-expression is not essential for all predicted mir-mrna interactions.

as new variants arise in a population and are exposed to different environmental conditions, those variants may be subject to forces of selection. moreover, if these snps alter gene expression they may modulate the individual's response to the environment and potentially the risk for particular disease state. based on this, we hypothesized that allele-specific mir-mrna interactions would show a greater level of selection than snps not classified as mress snps. we show that, as a group, predicted mress and cnm snps have a significantly higher mean fst than do those snps which do not create or disrupt a predicted mress. we identify those mress and cnm snps showing the highest degree of population subdivision and suggest these snps and the interactions they are predicted to modulate, as candidates for functional studies.

we show that the frequency of mress snps in validated mres  is less than in surrounding regions and this supports prior work showing a higher degree of negative selection on mresss  <cit> . although the level of variation within this region is lower, we do show that the occurrence of variation across validated mresss is not rare . supporting the notion that mir snps are high priority candidates for functional consequence we show that 22% of snps falling within validated mresss have reported associations related to a disease phenotype or risk. of note, our results differ somewhat from the mress snps reported in saunders, et al  <cit> . this is most likely due to the fact that we utilized a more current database of validated mre targets, and also that we required functional evidence of mress for inclusion.

there are several web based mre snp prediction databases available to query a snp for creation or disruption of a mress, however these tools incorporate a relatively limited amount of functional annotation  for identification of the most promising mress snps  <cit> . snpinfo, is a web tool which offers the calculation of ld between query snps and gwas snps in addition to functional prediction of these snps for abrogation or creation of potential mress  <cit> . approximately 70% of the snps found in tables s <dig> and s <dig> are also identified at snpinfo web portal as being a snp in ld with a gwas snp, and snpinfo also includes prediction of that snp as a mress snp. importantly, our work differs from what may be found at snpinfo and others, in that we present a more comprehensive summary of potential mresss snps, being the first to investigate  <dig> genomes data for mress snps. furthermore, we use this mress snp information in combination with a variety of publically available web tools and data sets , not currently incorporated in other resources, to determine which of these snps are most likely functional. our data demonstrates the utility of using multiple publically available datasets and resources to identify functional candidates.

in summary, we have surveyed the most current human snp data and identified variants that provide functional hypotheses for observed gwas associations. our work also suggests that a considerable number of snps create or abrogate mres in the human genome. our results further suggest mre snps that modulate gene expression are likely to be under selective pressure. with relevance to human disease we show that publicly available resources can be used to identify high priority candidate snps for functional studies.
