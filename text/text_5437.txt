BACKGROUND
complexes of physically interacting proteins form fundamental units responsible for
driving key biological processes within cells. even in the simple model organism
saccharomyces cerevisae , these complexes are composed to
several protein subunits that work in a coherent fashion to carry out cellular
functions. therefore a faithful reconstruction of the entire set of complexes  from the set of physical interactions  is essential
to understand their organisation and functions as well as their roles in diseases  <cit> .

in spite of the significant progress in computational identification of protein
complexes from protein interaction  networks over the last few years , computational methods are severely limited by noise  and
lack of sufficient interactions  in
currently available ppi datasets, particularly from human, to be able to completely
reconstruct the complexosome  <cit> . for example, several complexes involved in core cellular processes such as
cell cycle and dna damage response  are not present in a recent  compendium
of human protein complexes  assembled solely
by computational identification of complexes from high-throughput ppis <cit> ; a web-search  in this compendium for brca <dig> does not yield
any complexes even though brca <dig> is known to participate in three fundamental complexes
in ddr viz. brca1-a, brca1-b and brca1-c complexes  <cit> . a possible reason for missing these complexes is the lack of sufficient ppi
data required for identifying them even using the best available algorithms. but, the
authors of this compendium note that many human complexes appear to be ancient and
slowly evolving - roughly a quarter of the predicted complexes overlapped with complexes
from yeast and fly, with half of their subunits having clear orthologs  <cit> . therefore, it is useful to devise effective computational methods that look
for evidence from evolutionary conservation to complement ppi data to reconstruct the
full set of complexes.

in the attempt to integrate evolutionary information with ppi networks, kelley et
al.  <cit>  and sharan et al.  <cit>  devised methods to construct an orthology graph of conserved
interactions from two species, which in their experiments were yeast  and bacteria , using a sequence homology-based
 mapping of proteins between the species. dense
sub-graphs induced in this orthology graph represented putative complexes conserved
between the two species. the complexes so-identified were involved in core cellular
processes conserved between the two species - e.g. those in protein translation, ddr and
nuclear transport. van dam and snel   <cit>  studied rewiring of protein complexes between yeast and human using
high-throughput ppi datasets mapped onto known yeast and human complexes. from their
experiments, they concluded that a majority of co-complexed protein pairs retained their
interactions from yeast to human indicating that the evolutionary dynamics of complexes
was not due to extensive ppi network rewiring within complexes but instead due to gain
or loss of protein subunits from yeast to human. hirsh and sharan  <cit>  developed a protein evolution-based model and employed it to identify
conserved protein complexes between yeast and fly, while zhenping et al.  <cit>  used integer quadratic programming to align and identify conserved regions in
molecular networks. marsh et al.  <cit>  integrated data on ppi and structure to understand mechanisms of protein
conservation; they found that during evolution gene fusion events tend to optimize
complex assembly by simplifying complex topologies, indicating genome-wide pathways of
complex assembly.

integrating domain conservation
inspired from these works, here we devise a novel computational method to identify
conserved complexes and apply it to yeast and human datasets. a crucial
point we note on the conservation from yeast to human is that many cellular
mechanisms, though conserved, have in fact evolved many-fold in complexity - for
example, cell cycle and ddr. consequently, while several proteins in these mechanisms
are conserved by sequence similarity , there are others that are
unique  to human ; see figure  <dig> 
these non-conserved proteins perform similar functions  as
their conserved counterparts, but do not show high sequence similarity to any of the
yeast proteins. a deeper examination reveals that these proteins in fact contain
conserved functional domains - for example, the brct domain which is
present in yeast rad <dig> and human hrad <dig> is also present in the non-conserved human
brca <dig> and 53bp1; all of these play crucial roles in ddr  <cit> . similar structure can be seen in the case of recq helicases - several
helicase domains are conserved from the yeast sgs <dig> to human blm and wrn, but there
are three helicases recq <dig> , <dig> which are unique to human that also contain these
helicase domains  <cit> . therefore, integrating information on functional conservation,
mainly through domain conservation, can help to identify considerably more
 conserved complexes than mere sequence similarity, thereby throwing
further light on the conservation patterns of complexes in particular and cellular
processes in general.
yeast have either 'split' into multiple proteins or fused into common proteins
in human during evolution. this mechanism is a result of selecting optimal
protein assemblies  <cit>  thereby resulting in multi-fold expansion of complexity in human. in
order to capture these conservation mechanisms it is necessary to integrate
domain along with ppi information.

in order to achieve this, simple blast-based scores as used in earlier works  <cit>  to measure homology between yeast and human proteins do not suffice. here,
we integrate multiple databases including ensembl  <cit>  and orthomcl  <cit>  to build homology relationships among proteins; these databases use a
variety of information to construct orthologous groups among proteins
including checking for conserved domains. the integration of these databases
generates many-to-many correspondence between yeast and human proteins
instead of the predominantly one-to-one correspondence obtained by from blast-based
similarity.

we devise a novel computational method to construct an interolog network
using domain information along with ppi conservation between human and yeast.
next, we identify dense clusters within the interolog network using current
'state-of-the-art' ppi-clustering methods . these clusters when mapped back to the ppi networks reveal conserved
dense regions, many of which correspond to conserved complexes.

our experiments here reveal that,

 integrating domain information generates many valuable interactions
from the many-to-many ortholog relationships in the interolog network, thereby
enhancing its quality;

 interolog network also reduces false-positive interactions by
accounting for conserved ppis;

 our interolog network construction aids clustering algorithms to
identify far more conserved complexes than direct clustering of the individual ppi
networks; and

 many of these conserved complexes are involved in core cellular
processes such as cell cycle and ddr throwing further light to the conservation of
these cellular processes.

we call our method cocin .

methods
constructing the interolog network
given two ppi networks from two species s <dig> and s <dig>  and the
homology information between proteins of the two networks, we construct an
interolog network gi as follows. the two ppi networks are
represented as g <dig> and
g <dig>  and the homology relationship between
the proteins is governed by a many-to-many correspondence θ: v1
→ v <dig>  the interolog network is defined as
gi, where vi = {vi=
{p, q} | p∈v <dig>  q∈v <dig>  and ∈ θ}, and
ei= { | vi ={p,q};
v'i={r,s}; ∈e <dig> and
∈e2}.

each node in the interolog network represents a pair of homologous proteins,
one from each species. each edge in the interolog network represents an interaction
that is conserved in both species . however, if a protein p
∈ v <dig> can be orthologous to multiple proteins x ∈ v2
and x ∈ v <dig>  then we add two vertices to gi namely
{p, x} and {p, y}, and add an edge between two vertices. doing so integrates the
many-to-many relationships obtained due to domain conservation into the interolog
network. figure  <dig> below gives a simple example of this
network-construction.
interolog network constructing integrates ppi and domain conservation
information to generate a network that is conducive for clustering algorithms
to identify considerably more conserved complexes compared to direct clustering
of the original ppi networks from species.

any connected sub-network in this interolog network can be mapped back to conserved
sub-networks in the two ppi networks, and this is similar to the orthology graph
method introduced by kelley et al.  <cit>  and sharan et al.  <cit> . however, one unique advantage of our interolog network offers is that we
can infer a collection of homologous complexes between the species. this
property is highly relevant for identifying conserved complexes between yeast and
human .

in order to achieve this, we integrate multiple databases including ensembl  <cit>  and orthomcl  <cit>  to build our homology relationships among proteins; these databases use a
variety of information to construct orthologous groups among proteins including
checking for conserved domains.

clustering the interolog network and detection of conserved complexes
we identify dense clusters in the interolog network to detect conserved complexes
between the two species. to do this, we tested a variety 'state-of-the-art' ppi
network-clustering methods, and found the following three to perform the best - cmc
 by liu et al.  <cit> , mcl  by van dongen  <cit>  and haco  by wang et al.  <cit> . the comparative assessment of these methods has been confirmed with
earlier works  <cit> .

cmc operates by first enumerating all maximal cliques in network, and ranks them in
descending order of the weighted interaction density. it then iteratively merges
highly overlapping cliques to identify dense clusters in the network. mcl simulates a
series of random paths  and iteratively decomposes the network into a
number of dense clusters. haco performs hierarchical clustering by repeatedly
identifying smaller dense clusters and merging these into larger clusters. haco has
an advantage over the traditional hierarchical clustering because it allows for
overlaps  among the clusters.

upon finding dense clusters in the interolog network, we map back these clusters to
sub-networks within the two ppi networks to identify conserved complexes.

building a benchmark dataset for conserved protein complexes
due to lack of benchmark datasets of conserved protein complexes between human and
yeast in the literature, we built our own "gold standard" conserved dataset as
follows. using currently available datasets of manually curated protein complexes of
human and yeast, we selected pairs of complexes that shared significant fraction of
 proteins.

for measuring the conservation level of a given complex pair {c <dig> 
c2}, where c <dig> belongs to species s <dig> and c2
belongs to species s <dig>  we adopted the following multi-set
jaccard score:

multi-set jaccard score: let gc <dig> and gc <dig> be the
collections of ortholog groups in complexes c <dig> and c <dig> 
respectively. for any group
gi∈gci, let
ici represent the multiplicity of the group gi
in complex ci, which essentially is the number of paralogs
within the group. multi-set jaccard score is then given by:

 msj=∑gi∈min,ic2)∑gi∈max,ic2), 

there are often duplication of genes  within complexes and clusters.
therefore, msj takes into account the multiplicity of the groups and does a more
conservative and accurate estimation of the conservation between c <dig> and
c <dig>  see figure  <dig> for an illustration.
a "gold standard" conserved complexes dataset to test our method. we use two
scores here - the jaccard score for orthologous groups and multi-set jaccard
score.

we selected pairs of complexes that show msj ≥ 50% .

RESULTS
preparation of experimental data
we combined multiple ppi datasets to enhance the coverage of our interactome. we
collected ppis from intact  <cit>   and biogrid  <cit>   databases for yeast; and from biogrid  <cit>  and hprd  <cit>   for human. table  <dig> and  <dig> summarise these datasets.

yeast curated complexes were gathered from wodak database   <cit>  and human curated complexes from corum   <cit> ; these form our benchmark complex datasets . we used ensembl  <cit>  and orthomcl  <cit>  for the homology mapping between human and yeast proteins.

criteria for evaluating predicted complexes
for a predicted complex ci of one species and a manually curated
 complex bj, we used jaccard score based on
collections of complex proteins: j=|ci∩bj||ci∪bj|, which considers ci a correct
prediction for bj if j≥t, a match threshold. we chose t
=  <dig>  in our experiments as suggested by earlier works  <cit> . ci is then referred to as a matched prediction
or matched predicted complex, and bj is referred to
as a derived benchmark complex.

based on this, precision is computed as the fraction of predicted complexes
matching benchmark complexes, and the recall is computed as the fraction of
benchmark protein complexes covered by our predicted complexes. a correctly predicted
complex is also checked against our "gold standard" testing dataset to see if it is a
conserved complex, in which case the derived complex is a derived conserved
complex.

results of complex detection using interolog network and human ppis. we map back each predicted cluster from the in to the original ppi
networks to predict conserved complexes between the two species.

firstly, we compared the results of complex detection from cocin with direct
clustering of the original ppi networks using cmc, haco and mcl as shown in tables
 <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, we observed
that cocin, which employs cmc, haco and mcl for clustering the interolog network,
yielded a better recall than these methods on the original ppi networks. further,
because in capitalises on the existence of interactions in both ppi networks , the number of noisy dense clusters in cocin is
considerably reduced thereby enhancing its precision.

and chform a pair of orthologous complexes, but by
direct clustering of the original ppi networks and matching them and not using cocin.
we noticed that cy and chcontained several
noisy proteins and interactions among them which were false positives. these false
positives reduced the jaccard accuracy of these complexes when matched to known
benchmark complexes. we also note that when we computed the complex-derivability
index called component-edge score  proposed in  <cit> , ci had a higher ce-score compared to cy

the additional protein complexes of human and yeast detected by cocin. as many noisy
interactions are removed in the in, among the conserved complexes that are detected
by both cmc and cocin, cocin on an average obtained higher jaccard scores. some
important additional conserved complexes found using cocin were: rna polymerase ii,
eif <dig> complex, msh2-mlh1-pms2-pcna dna-repair initiation complex, mcm complex, mmr

the result of complex detection in the conserved subnetworks
to further understand the advantage of cocin on leveraging conservation for better
detection of complexes, we performed another experiment alternative to the
interolog network as follows. we predicted complexes from the subset of protein
interactions of the first species that are conserved in the second . however, this can only
find complexes of one species at a time, so we map these predicted complexes onto the
ppi network of the other species to identify the corresponding conserved complexes.
we employed cmc to do clustering on the conserved subnetworks.

complex prediction from conserved subnetworks showed similar result as cocin -16
additional conserved complexes in human and  <dig> additional conserved complexes in yeast
are found. this supported the purpose of in - to leverage conserved interactions for
improving complex prediction.
conserved complexes are found by cocin but missed by cmc. we see from this picture
that the predicted human complex from in  and the corresponding
predicted complex from the conserved subnetwork  were contained in
a larger cmc-predicted complex  from the original ppi
networks. this larger complex included several noisy proteins that reduce the
accuracy of the complex, thereby causing the complex to be missed.
clusters detected from the original ppi networks include several noisy proteins
and noisy interactions , thereby reducing their jaccard
accuracies.

comparisons with other complex detection methods in ppi networks
similar results were obtained using the other two methods haco and mcl as well,
thereby supporting the effectiveness of cocin in identifying conserved protein
complexes. tables  <dig> and  <dig> present these
comparisons in more details, while figures  <dig> and  <dig> highlight further substantiate these results.

integrating domain information significantly enhances interolog construction
finally, table  <dig> summarizes the quality of our testing dataset
for conserved protein complexes between yeast and human. we compared the number of
benchmark conserved complexes found in both human and yeast using mappings from
ensembl and orthomcl under multiple conservation score thresholds . note that ensembl contains homology information based
on both sequence similarity as well as domain conservation, while orthomcl is
predominantly based on sequence similarity. we noticed that using ensembl homology
information can yield more conserved complexes at all conservation score thresholds.
further, figure  <dig> shows that there exist 1-to-many and
many-to-many relationships of conservation between human and yeast complexes.

sharan et al. used whole-sequence similarity to construct the interolog network.
here, we used orthomcl as a substitute for the whole-sequence similarity due to
technical difficulties of running blast for a large number of proteins. we compared
the performance of using orthomcl against using ensembl, which uses domain
conservation along with sequence similarity to determine orthology. table  <dig> and figure  <dig> show that we obtain an
overall improvement in terms of the number of mapped protein pairs, interologs, as
well as conserved protein complexes in both human and yeast by incorporating domain
information . this substantiates the improved performance of cocin
over traditional sequence-similarity based methods.

discussionpattern of protein complexes from yeast to human. we believe that this picture reflects
the actual situation, and it overrides the belief that a yeast complex is essentially a
 subset of a human complex with only a few new proteins added to the human
complex. in other words, the conservation pattern from yeast to human is highly
intricate involving dispersion and re-distribution of proteins and their functions
across complexes along with addition of several new proteins in human. at a very high
level, though core cellular mechanisms such as cell cycle and ddr are indeed conserved
from yeast to human, within these mechanisms, considerable re-arrangements have
occurred. this finding can have implications on studies attempting to extrapolate
relationships such as synthetic lethality  from yeast to human. in particular, we
believe that many of the sl relationships may not be conserved from yeast to human, or
even if conserved, may not be identifiable by simple blast-based sequence-similarity
mappings.

CONCLUSIONS
identifying conserved complexes between species is a fundamental step towards
identification of conserved mechanisms from model organisms to higher level organisms.
current methods based on clustering ppi networks do not work well in identifying
conserved complexes, and they are severely limited by lack of true interactions and
presence of large amounts of false interactions in existing ppi datasets. here, we
presented a method cocin based on building interolog networks from the ppi networks of
species to identify conserved complexes. our experiments on yeast and human datasets
revealed that our method can identify considerably more conserved complexes that plain
clustering of the original ppi networks. further, we demonstrated that integrating
domain information generates many-to-many ortholog relationships which significantly
enhances interolog quality and throws further light on conservation of mechanisms
between yeast and human.
