BACKGROUND
over the past  <dig> years, the search for bioactive secondary metabolites  from marine organisms has yielded a wealth of new molecules  with many fundamentally new chemotypes and extraordinary potential for biomedical research and applications . marine cyanobacteria continue to be among the most fruitful sources of marine natural products, with nearly  <dig> compounds described  <cit> . the filamentous marine cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula  is of particular importance, as approximately 35% of all cyanobacterial bioactive compounds have been reported from the genus lyngbya, with 76% of these coming from l. majuscula  <cit> . more recently, compound isolation and structure elucidation from l. majuscula has been complemented with the characterization of biosynthetic gene clusters that encode a number of these compounds. the gene clusters for several potent anticancer and neurotoxic agents such as curacin a, barbamide, and the jamaicamides have provided new insight into the biosynthetic strategies and logic used by this organism for compound production, as well as unique enzymes involved in unprecedented molecular tailoring reactions  <cit> .

despite considerable interest in pursuing cyanobacterial lead compounds as potential drug candidates, an adequate supply of these compounds for clinical research is often impossible to obtain without impractically large scale field collections or sophisticated and expensive synthetic methods  <cit> . with some notable examples  <cit>  it has been difficult to induce microbial gene clusters to produce their natural products in heterologous hosts, and thus this technology is not currently predictable  <cit> . equally problematic, filamentous marine cyanobacteria such as lyngbya grow slowly in laboratory culture, with doubling times in some cases of about  <dig> days  <cit> .

one avenue for increasing compound production from marine cyanobacteria could be to take advantage of regulatory elements associated with a biosynthetic gene cluster of interest. although genetic controls of several primary metabolic functions in cyanobacteria including circadian rhythms  <cit> , heterocyst development  <cit> , and nutrient uptake  <cit>  have been described, information regarding transcriptional regulation of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites is currently limited to freshwater toxins such as the microcystins. the microcystins are potent hepatotoxins synthesized by several freshwater cyanobacteria of worldwide occurrence  <cit>  and are generated via a mixed polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  gene cluster  <cit> . expression of the microcystin gene cluster is positively correlated with increased light intensity and red light in particular  <cit> . moreover, the gene cluster has different transcription start sites depending on light levels  <cit> . other environmental factors have been evaluated for their effects on microcystin production, and increasing evidence suggests that iron may be important. transcription of genes from the microcystin gene cluster increases with iron starvation  <cit> , and in the presence of iron, a ferric uptake regulator  protein appears to bind to the microcystin bidirectional promoter and may decrease microcystin production  <cit> . because it complexes with iron and other metals  <cit>  microcystin may therefore function as a siderophore. alternatively, microcystin has been proposed to serve in intraspecies communication, where release of the compound is interpreted as cell death by other microcystis sp. and causes increased microcystin production to enhance localized toxicity  <cit> .

as with microcystin, many of the toxins found in l. majuscula are also produced by gene clusters comprised of pks/nrps architecture. pks/nrps gene clusters in other bacteria have been found to include imbedded regulatory proteins, such as the streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins  found within the confines of several antibiotic pathways in streptomyces  <cit> . however, cyanobacterial natural product gene clusters identified to date do not contain any apparent associated regulatory proteins.

insight into the mechanisms used by l. majuscula in the transcription of secondary metabolite gene clusters could be of significant value in enhancing the overproduction of potential drug leads in laboratory culture. increased compound yield would reduce the need and environmental impact of repeated large scale field collections or the time and expense of chemical synthesis. additionally, because the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters identified thus far from l. majuscula have been from different strains of the same species, transcription of each pathway could be under similar mechanisms of regulation.

this paper provides an analysis of transcriptional regulatory elements associated with the jamaicamide gene cluster from lyngbya majuscula, and to our knowledge is the first such effort for a secondary metabolite gene cluster from a marine cyanobacterium. the jamaicamides are mixed pks/nrps neurotoxins that exhibit sodium channel blocking activity and fish toxicity. the molecules contain unusual structural features including a vinyl chloride and alkynyl bromide  <cit> . the gene cluster encoding jamaicamide biosynthesis is  <dig> kbp in length, and is composed of  <dig> orfs that encode for proteins ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. intergenic regions between  <dig> and  <dig> bp are located between all but two of the orfs, and a region of approximately  <dig> bp exists between the first jamaicamide orf  and the closest upstream  orf outside of the cluster . in this study, we used rt-pcr to locate the transcriptional start site  of the jamaicamide gene cluster. because it is not yet possible to perform genetics in filamentous marine cyanobacteria such as lyngbya, we used a reporter gene assay to identify several possible internal pathway promoters. we also isolated at least one possible regulatory protein using pulldown experiments that is able to bind to the region upstream of the transcription start site in gel shift assays. bioinformatic analyses conducted with the protein sequence suggest a correlation between secondary metabolite production and complementary chromatic adaptation  in cyanobacteria.

RESULTS
rt-pcr using l. majuscula rna to search for the transcriptional start site  and promoter regions in the jamaicamide pathway
the initial characterization of the jamaicamide gene cluster  <cit>  described that the first  <dig> orfs of the gene cluster  are all transcribed in the forward direction, while the last orf  is transcribed in the reverse direction . in order to determine the location of the transcriptional start site  of the gene cluster, rna was isolated from the jamaicamide producing strain of lyngbya majuscula . first strand cdna was synthesized using reverse transcriptase and a reverse primer designed as a complement to the 5' end of the jama gene . initial experiments creating second strand cdna using the first strand cdna as template found that an unusually long untranslated leader region of at least  <dig> bp preceded jama. a primer extension experiment was conducted in which second strand cdna was amplified in  <dig> bp increments beyond this  <dig> bp location. the experiment indicated that transcription of rna began between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the jama orf start site . using comparisons to consensus promoter and transcription start regions in e. coli  <cit> , a putative promoter was identified which, relative to a probable tss , included conserved hexamer rna polymerase  binding sites at - <dig> and - <dig> bp, a conserved extended - <dig> tgn region upstream of the - <dig> box, and an optimal dna length between the hexamers  .

we also evaluated whether the jamaicamide gene cluster contained non-transcribed intergenic regions between orfs that could indicate the presence of breaks in the transcripts. primers designed for those intergenic regions in the pathway  <dig> bp in size or larger  were used for synthesizing and amplifying cdna to determine whether they were transcribed. all of the intergenic regions in the jamaicamide pathway tested were amplified into second strand cdna, including the intergenic region between jamp and jamq. intergenic regions between the two orfs downstream of jamq  were also transcribed. these results indicated that the majority of the jamaicamide gene cluster is composed of the operon jamabcdefghijklmnop. because no apparent breaks in transcription occurred between jamq and at least the two neighboring downstream transposases  and a hypothetical protein , one contiguous transcript may encode the translation of all of these proteins. transcription of the intergenic region between jamp and jamq indicated that a transcript including jamp must extend at least into the complementary strand of jamq before termination, although transcription in the opposite direction would be necessary to generate jamq mrna.

use of promoter prediction and β-galactosidase reporter gene assays to search for promoter activity
the large size  of the main jamaicamide operon  suggested that multiple promoters would likely be needed for efficient jamaicamide transcription. because transcripts were found for each of the intergenic regions between the orfs, these promoters may function intermittently and could be subject to promoter occlusion  <cit> . a software prediction program  was used to predict whether the intergenic regions from the jamaicamide pathway contained conserved promoter binding regions. several of these regions were predicted to contain at least one potential pair of - <dig> and - <dig> binding sites . because transformation methods into l. majuscula have not yet been developed, we used a reporter gene assay in e. coli to determine whether any of these upstream  regions could function as promoters. each region predicted to contain a promoter , as well as the promoter upstream of the jamaicamide tss, was amplified with specific primers from fosmids containing different portions of the jamaicamide biosynthetic pathway . each of these regions were individually ligated into the pblue topo vector  and transformed into top- <dig> e. coli. the resulting constructs were evaluated for relative promoter activity using the β-galactosidase reporter gene assay , standardized against total soluble protein content measured by bca assay . for upjama, two regions were evaluated, including the region predicted to contain the initial promoter, as well as immediately upstream of the jama gene . the arabinose promoter from e. coli was amplified from the pbad vector  and ligated into the pblue vector as a positive control, while a  <dig> bp segment of a jamaicamide pathway gene  ligated into pblue vector was used as a negative control.

a: numbers correspond to bp in complementary 3' - 5' direction.

bold - <dig> and - <dig> binding regions were predicted using bprom  in comparison to the e. coli σ <dig> consensus - <dig>  and - <dig>  promoter regions.  if upstream regions had more than one predicted promoter region, the region receiving the highest predicted score is provided . each upstream region listed in the first column had activity in the reporter assay, except those not shown in bold text.  the italic atg in the second upjami predicted promoter region indicates the jami start codon.  tss nucleotides were predicted to be a or g based on comparisons to the most common tss nucleotides in e. coli <cit> .

several of the tested intergenic regions exhibited significantly stronger promoter activity than the positive control, including the promoter identified from the primer extension experiment , as well as upjamb, upjamd, and upjami . the intergenic regions upjamg and upjamn both had some promoter activity, although lower than the positive control. the region upstream of jamq did not have any detectable promoter activity in the assay, which suggested that the promoter for this transcript may be located upstream of an adjacent orf.

to more precisely localize the promoter regions upstream of two of these genes, a series of additional assays were conducted using truncated regions of upjama  and upjami. for upjama, promoter activity was comparable relative to the positive control when testing longer upstream fragments . however, when small fragments closer to the jama orf start site were used, the promoter activity increased significantly, with maximal activity observed for the fragment - <dig> -  <dig> bp upstream of jama. the promoter in the - <dig> -  <dig> region appeared to require the sequence fragment - <dig> -  <dig>  as another construct containing the region upjama- <dig> - - <dig> did not have any promoter activity. the entire  <dig> bp upjami upstream region also displayed strong promoter activity relative to the positive control. promoter activity was lost using fragments encompassing - <dig> - - <dig> bp, but restored using the fragment - <dig> -  <dig> bp . inspection of the sequences included in these active, truncated regions of upjama and upjami led to the identification of possible conserved promoter elements in close proximity to the orf start sites for both genes .

to quantitatively determine the promoter activities of the dna fragments, a series of β-galactosidase assays incorporating a serial dilution of e. coli soluble protein lysate was also used in order to avoid saturation problems in color development . these data were used to calculate β-galactosidase activity in terms of nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig> for each of the upstream fragments with any detectable promoter activity. the strongest promoter was the section upstream of the jamaicamide tss , with an average of approximately  <dig> nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig>  the promoter immediately upstream of jama  and those upstream of jamb, jamd, and jami yielded lower values, with upjama, upjamb and upjami between 500- <dig> nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig>  and upjamd at approximately  <dig> nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig>  reduced activity was found for promoters upstream of jamc, jamg, and jamn, with values ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig>  the arabinose promoter positive control construct yielded an average value of  <dig> nmol onpg hydrolyzed min- <dig> mg soluble protein- <dig> 

isolation and characterization of possible transcription factors from a pulldown assay
to determine whether jamaicamide regulatory proteins are encoded in the l. majuscula jhb genome, we performed dna - protein "pulldown" experiments to isolate proteins with affinity to the upstream region of jama. a biotinylated, dna probe extending from  <dig> bp upstream of jama to  <dig> bp into the jama gene  was used to label streptavidin coated magnetic dynabeads , which were then incubated with a soluble protein lysate from l. majuscula jhb. a series of wash steps were first conducted to remove proteins non-specifically bound, followed by elution of those proteins specifically bound to the probe. this elution was visualized using sds-page and revealed at least two bands of approximately 30- <dig> kda in size . the protein bands from the gel, as well as crude fractions eluted from the magnetic beads in repeated experiments, were analyzed with lc-ms/ms.

the fragmented peptides generated from the lc-ms/ms analysis of the gel bands were used to query the unfinished lyngbya majuscula 3l genome  using the ms/ms post-processing program inspect  <cit> . by this approach, two proteins were identified with high confidence from "band 2" , which had a global distribution  among the identified peptides:  all <dig> protein , and  hypothetical protein . manual annotation of the most abundant peptide identified within the primary sequence of all <dig> demonstrated the b and y ion series fell within a mass error of 5- <dig> ppm. furthermore, the b and y-ion series for this peptide showed 22/ <dig> possible fragmentations covered with several contingent ion series. the ion series for the hypothetical protein showed similar results to the all <dig> protein. results from the lc-ms/ms of the page gel "band 1"  were inconclusive. separate analyses of the elution fractions identified with high confidence the same all <dig> and hypothetical protein from band  <dig>  as well as a number of putative proteins in the 3l genome such as a peptidase  and an ap endonuclease . several pigment related proteins were also identified that were not visually apparent by sds-page , including c-phycoerythrin class  <dig> subunit alpha , allophycocyanin alpha subunit , and photosystem i  .

blast analyses of the all <dig> and the hypothetical protein  both yielded a number of hypothetical protein matches in other cyanobacteria including anabaena variabilis, microcoleus chthonoplastes, nostoc punctiforme, and trichodesmium erythraeum . interestingly, both proteins also matched  with the protein rcad, an activator protein from the cyanobacterium calothrix  known to regulate complementary chromatic adaptation  <cit> . complementary chromatic adaptation  is a phenomenon exhibited by many cyanobacteria in response to changes in light wavelength and intensity. cca allows cyanobacteria to alter pigment levels so as to optimize their capacity for photosynthesis, and usually involves variation between green and red phenotypes  <cit> . rcad is a protein that binds to the promoter for phycocyanin  <dig>  and alters the expression of several red light operons in the acclimation phase of cca  <cit> . another protein, rcag, is located downstream of rcad and has been identified as a putative atpase. rcag may facilitate binding of rcad to dna, and could require phosphorylation to complete this task  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of the l. majuscula 3l genome revealed that the proteins immediately downstream of  <dig> and  <dig> both resulted in blast hits with rcag, although as with rcad, the protein neighboring  <dig>  had much stronger sequence identity than the neighboring protein to  <dig> .

primers were designed from each of the gene sequences for the two proteins identified above using the l. majuscula 3l unfinished genome, and were successful in amplifying homologous gene sequences from l. majuscula jhb genomic dna. the jhb homolog to  <dig> encodes for a protein that differs from the 3l protein by only one amino acid , while the  <dig> homolog in jhb encodes for a protein  <dig> % identical to the  <dig> protein in 3l. alignments of each jhb protein with their nearest respective blast hits  indicated several conserved sequence regions, with the highest level of conservation found toward the c terminal end of the proteins   <cit> .

recombinant expression of identified proteins and electromobility shift assays 
the sequences encoding the  <dig> and  <dig> proteins in jhb were used in creating constructs for recombinant expression in e. coli . after expression and purification of each protein, both were used in electromobility shift assays . in these assays, protein and a fragment of dna amplified from a region that included both the sequence of the primary jamaicamide promoter and the region upstream from the original probe  were incubated and visualized on native page gels. recombinant  <dig> was found to bind this putative transcription factor binding region upstream of jama after his tag removal with thrombin cleavage , although promiscuous binding was also observed with other control dna fragments . a serial titration of  <dig> with the n-terminal his tag still attached showed increased dna binding with larger amounts of protein . recombinant protein  <dig> was expressed and purified with a gst-tag on the n-terminus of the protein. however, attempts to remove the gst tag were unsuccessful, and thus we assayed protein  <dig> with the gst tag still attached . this version of  <dig> did not bind to the upjama- <dig> - - <dig> bp region , even with elevated protein concentrations .

discussion
in this study, we explored the transcriptional machinery associated with the jamaicamide biosynthetic gene cluster in lyngbya majuscula. the jamaicamide cluster was chosen because it possesses a number of features commonly seen in other secondary metabolites isolated from marine cyanobacteria  <cit> . the jamaicamides are produced by the most prolific cyanobacterial natural product producer yet known , are bioactive , are composed of mixed pks/nrps derived subunits, and contain unusual structural features such as a vinyl chloride and alkynyl bromide rarely seen in natural products from other organisms.

the first description of the jamaicamides  <cit>  demonstrated that the cluster is composed of  <dig> orfs, with  <dig> transcribed in the same direction. the cluster is flanked on the 5' and the 3' ends by transposases and hypothetical proteins. from the results of our rt-pcr experiments, it appears that the gene cluster is preceded by an unusually long untranslated leader region , one that may be unprecedented in size for a secondary metabolite gene cluster. the function of having such a long region between the tss and the start codon of jama is unclear at this time, but may be important for overall regulation of the pathway. in synechococcus pcc  <dig>  the psbaii and psbaiii genes encoding the photosystem ii reaction center d <dig> protein have cis regulatory elements in addition to basal promoters. contained in the untranslated leader region downstream of the psb tss are light responsive elements that were found to be responsible for increased expression of the genes under high light conditions  <cit> . in the jamaicamide pathway, the fact that another region of dna immediately upstream of jama can function as a strong promoter indicates that although transcription may initiate well before the orf start site, there could be a supplemental means of boosting transcription closer to the first protein in the cluster.

the amplification of second strand cdna from jhb rna corresponding to all of the intergenic regions between the jamaicamide orfs tested indicated that the pathway is transcribed in at least two pieces. the first, jamabcdefghijklmnop, is sufficiently large  to assume that multiple transcripts could be needed to process this portion of the gene cluster. a similar situation was found with the microcystin gene cluster  <cit> , in which all of the intergenic regions of the pathway aside from the bidirectional promoter were transcribed, and race experiments with several of these regions detected variations in intergenic tss locations. as with microcystin, the jamaicamide pathway could contain internal promoters which, while not representing true breaks in the transcription of the pathway, can function independently if not overwritten by rnap acting from an upstream promoter . indeed, several of these regions were able to function as promoters in a reporter assay .

a second transcript in the direction complementary to the large transcript in the jamaicamide pathway is probably needed to include jamq, a gene encoding a condensation like protein that is likely involved with the creation of the pyrrolinone ring of the molecule. according to our rt-pcr experiments, the regions between jamq and the three genes closest upstream , are all transcribed. in addition, the upstream region of jamq does not appear to serve as a strong promoter in β-galactosidase reporter assays , despite the presence of possible conserved promoter domains . from these data, it appears that jamq could be part of a larger transcript including these transposases. a larger intergenic region  lies upstream of orf <dig>  which could contain the tss and a promoter for this transcript. the reason for including at least one transposase in the jamq transcript is unclear, but this may be a way of ensuring transposable elements have remained associated with the cluster so as to facilitate horizontal gene transfer and pathway evolution. the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster from l. majuscula jhb  <cit>  contains a transposase  located between two of the initial genes  in the pathway, which is also thought to contribute to the plasticity of the cluster.

biosynthetic investigations using lyngbya majuscula strains have been highly successful in identifying secondary metabolite gene clusters, in part because l. majuscula readily incorporates isotopically labeled precursors in feeding studies  <cit> . however, further experimentation by way of gene knockout or overexpression in l. majuscula is not yet possible because a viable means of genetic transformation has not been developed. due to this limitation, we used genetic constructs in e. coli to determine whether the promoters identified in this study, including the primary pathway promoter upstream of the tss and those predicted in intergenic regions, were functional. although some differences exist in the structure of rnap between the two bacteria  <cit> , promoter structures in cyanobacteria are often compared to consensus sequences in e. coli  <cit> . furthermore, a strong e. coli promoter has been shown to function in the cyanobacterium synechococcus  <cit>  and the psb <dig> promoter from microcystis can be used in e. coli to drive β-galactosidase production  <cit> . the reporter assay proved effective in verifying the promoter identified upstream of the jamaicamide pathway tss, as well as several internal promoters located at various regions throughout the gene cluster . previous studies with β-galactosidase reporter assays have been useful in demonstrating how enhancer elements within untranslated leader regions and intergenic promoters are important in driving transcription  <cit> . the strongest promoter in the assay was that identified upstream of the jama tss, but several other promoters were either equal to or greater in strength than the positive control in the assay. one of the regions predicted to contain a strong promoter  is located in front of a large set of orfs. the orf jami, encoding an enoyl-coa hydratase/isomerase, forms a di-domain with jamj, which encodes for an enoyl reductase and a large pks  <cit> . in addition, the subsequent orfs in the pathway  are separated by small intergenic regions and do not appear to contain promoters. if jami - m form one contiguous transcript , a promoter in front of jami could be needed for efficient transcription. the identification of functional promoters in several other intergenic regions suggests that they could also be used to boost transcription beyond the capacity of the initial promoter located before the tss upstream of jama.

one intriguing finding from using truncated intergenic regions in the β-galactosidase assay was the detection of strong activity immediately upstream of jama  and jami  . an additional promoter was predicted in a region of upjami  farther upstream in the 5' direction , but this region was not active when used in truncated form . if these active regions upstream of jama  and jami  are able to act as internal promoters to supplement overall transcription of the jamaicamide pathway, their close proximity to jama and jami may compromise the ability of transcripts initiating at these positions to subsequently allow for proper translation of the jama and jami proteins . this could occur as a result of insufficient room for a ribosome binding site, although translation of mrna in cyanobacteria may not require the use of shine-dalgarno sequences  <cit>  and some evidence exists for translation of leaderless mrna in bacteria  <cit> . it is possible that our heterologous use of these upjama  and upjami  regions in e. coli could lead to false positive identification of promoters in some instances. however, as previously discussed, the organization of the gene cluster supports the utility of functional promoters in both locations. the untranslated leader region of jama is long enough for the presence of additional regulatory elements, and upjami is a probable location for a promoter because of the long jami - m transcript. further evaluation of these two possible promoters will be necessary to determine how transcription from their locations could affect subsequent protein translation.

of particular interest in this study was the successful isolation of proteins using "pulldown" experiments that could be involved in the regulation of jamaicamide expression. gene clusters of marine cyanobacterial pks/nrps secondary metabolites identified to date lack any associated regulatory proteins that are imbedded in or in proximity to the main cluster, in contrast to antibiotic pathways in other prokaryotes such as actinobacteria  <cit> . this absence has led to the suggestion that secondary metabolite pathways from l. majuscula could be constitutively expressed  <cit> . by using the upstream region of jama as a dna probe, we hoped to isolate putative regulatory proteins from the soluble protein fraction of jhb. this was predicted on the hypothesis that if the jamaicamide pathway does have associated regulatory proteins, they are located elsewhere in the genome. a biotinylated dna sequence from the jamaicamide pathway  was incubated with protein lysate from l. majuscula jhb. the probe was long enough to encompass the entire untranslated leader region of the pathway, as well as the primary promoter and an additional  <dig> bp upstream of the promoter - <dig> hexamer. because transcription factors commonly bind at either the - <dig> box of the promoter itself, or within  <dig> bp of the - <dig> box  <cit> , it is probable that the probe was long enough to capture proteins that might associate with the promoter. the probe also allowed for binding of regulatory proteins with affinity to the untranslated leader region  <cit> . analysis of protein samples isolated from both an excised sds-page gel band and elution fractions of several repeated pulldown assays consistently identified two proteins in three separate data sets using lc-ms/ms. these proteins were partially identified using sequence data from the unfinished l. majuscula 3l genome , a strain from curaçao responsible for the production of the anticancer compound curacin a  <cit> . the two proteins  displayed strongest sequence identity to hypothetical proteins found in other cyanobacteria, but could not immediately be assigned a function. blast searches with both proteins resulted in hits with rcad, a protein involved in complementary chromatic adaptation  in another species of cyanobacteria  <cit> . interestingly, although the level of sequence identity of the two proteins with rcad was quite different , both proteins  had a similar gene neighborhood to rcad, indicating probable synteny. the l. majuscula 3l proteins downstream of each  both had blast hits with rcag, the atpase associated with rcad, although  <dig>  had significantly more identity than  <dig> .

complementary chromatic adaptation has been identified in a number of freshwater  <cit>  and marine cyanobacteria  <cit> . in the cyanobacterial cca model organism fremyella , a photoreceptor circuit involving the rca receptors and response regulators  has been found to be responsible for pigment modifications under red and green light  <cit> . rcad appears to affect several operons during the acclimation phase of cca  <cit> . although lyngbya majuscula strains have not been observed to undergo cca in culture, there are several color morphotypes known . in addition, a microarray analysis of cyanobacteria undergoing cca found that over  <dig> genes were upregulated, including many not involved in photosynthesis  <cit> . considering the widespread effects that cca regulatory proteins play in cyanobacteria, it is plausible that secondary metabolite production is regulated by homologous proteins. regulation by light could also be in accordance with the mechanisms previously described for the microcystin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> .

to further evaluate the two possible regulatory proteins isolated in the pulldown assay, we overexpressed both proteins in e. coli to evaluate their respective binding affinities for the jamaicamide primary promoter region. protein  <dig> was found to bind to the proposed transcription factor binding region of the jamaicamide pathway , and this dna binding activity was supported with serial protein titration . although we demonstrated that a control protein would not bind under the same conditions, we also found that protein  <dig> was able to bind nonspecifically to several other unrelated pieces of dna. thus, we were unable to assign a specific sequence for  <dig> binding. attempts to cleave the gst tag from the  <dig> protein were unsuccessful, and binding assays indicated that the gst+ <dig> fusion protein was not able to bind to the same intergenic region as  <dig> . because of its strong affinity with dna,  <dig> is the better candidate protein for providing transcriptional regulation of the jamaicamide pathway. the presence of multiple intergenic promoters in the pathway could also offer other binding locations for additional regulation.

it is difficult to predict how the binding affinity of recombinant forms of  <dig> or  <dig> compares quantitatively with the native proteins. noubir et al.  <cit>  found that native rcad bound much more effectively to the phycocyanin  <dig> promoter than a recombinant version, and hypothesized that the reduced affinity may be from lack of atpase rcag, which facilitates binding, or from lack of phosphorylation. we attempted a dual-shift experiment with  <dig> and the gst tagged  <dig>  but no shift differences compared to  <dig> alone were observed . it will be intriguing to determine whether  <dig> and  <dig> work in tandem to regulate the jamaicamide pathway, or if they require downstream neighbors  to assist in binding. alternatively, it is possible that  <dig> is the true regulator of the pathway, and  <dig> was "pulled down" in the magnetic bead assay due to its sequence identity being minimally sufficient for recognition. interestingly, protein  <dig> was found to form dimers by page analysis. transcription factors often function as dimers in their association with dna and rnap  <cit> , and thus, this finding also supports  <dig> as the best candidate regulatory protein identified in this study.

if transcription factors are in fact regulating the expression of secondary metabolites such as jamaicamide, it is useful to consider the potential pleiotropic role of proteins such as  <dig> in regulating more than one biosynthetic pathway in l. majuscula jhb. there are a number of similarities in the secondary metabolite gene clusters of l. majuscula, such as those encoding for the jamaicamides, hectochlorin  with the upstream region of cura from the curacin a pathway reveals that approximately  <dig> bp of the upjama region is 95% identical with the upcura region. moreover, proteins  <dig> and  <dig> are  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical with their respective homologs in l. majuscula 3l . if either of these two proteins functions as a pleiotropic regulator for natural products biosynthesis in l. majuscula, their use in overexpression efforts would be valuable in unlocking the full biosynthetic potential of these filamentous marine cyanobacteria.

ultimately, quantitative co-transcription analyses of the two proteins with the rest of the jamaicamide pathway and gene knockouts will be necessary to conclusively link these proteins with jamaicamide regulation. current efforts are evaluating transcription levels of the two proteins with both jamaicamide transcription and compound production, and the effect of variable light wavelengths on jamaicamide production in culture. because targeted gene manipulation techniques in l. majuscula have not yet been developed, we are also in the process of conducting methodology experiments to disrupt or overexpress  <dig> and  <dig> to better understand their functions, including their roles in global regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the regulation of natural product pathways that encode compounds with pharmaceutical potential is important to overcoming the "supply issue" that is so prevalent in natural products research  <cit> . while marine cyanobacteria are recognized as prolific producers of bioactive compounds, natural product yields from field collections are low, and slow culture growth severely limits the amount of compound that can be produced in this manner. the transcriptional profile of the jamaicamide biosynthetic gene cluster presented here provides insight into the mechanisms by which these pathways are transcribed and potentially regulated. future advances in classifying promoters and transcription factors for cyanobacterial gene clusters will be important to diverse applications in biotechnology, such as combinatorial biosynthesis and the heterologous expression of entire natural product pathways. additionally, this information should also benefit ongoing efforts attempting to regulate the expression of cyanobacterial toxins with deleterious environmental impacts.
