BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is a common, highly invasive malignant tumor associated with a high mortality rate  <cit> . the resistance of hcc to existing antineoplastic agents and the limited effectiveness of chemotherapies due to underlying liver disease contribute to the poor prognosis for patients with hcc  <cit> . although surgical resection is the preferred standard of care for patients with hcc, few patients are suitable candidates for this treatment and recurrence is common even after radical curative resection  <cit> . given the inadequate impact of conventional therapies and the rising incidence of hcc, elucidation of the oncogenic mechanisms underlying hcc development is critical for identifying potential therapeutic targets or modalities.

snail is a well-known zinc finger  transcriptional repressor responsible for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions  and metastasis in several cancers  <cit> . we previously reported that upregulation of human snai <dig>  expression by reactive oxygen species contributes to the invasive nature of hcc, in part by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and downregulating e-cadherin expression through both transcriptional repression and epigenetic modification of the e-cadherin promoter  <cit> . other recent reports have revealed that snail induces broad epigenetic modifications of target genes by interacting with tumor-associated proteins   <cit> . taken together, the ability of snail to promote oncogenic transformation and cancer cell invasion is likely mediated by its interactions with other proteins in addition to its transcriptional activity.

the notch signaling pathway regulates embryonic cell determination and differentiation as well as postnatal development  <cit> . although alterations in the notch pathway are associated with malignant processes, there is also evidence that supports a tumor-suppressive role for notch signals  <cit> . activation of the notch pathway is initiated through juxtacrine ligand-receptor interactions and the proteolytic cleavage of notch <dig> by γ-secretase, which liberates the notch <dig> intracellular domain  from the membrane, allowing nicd to translocate to the nucleus  <cit> . nuclear nicd then associates with csl  transcriptional factors to inhibit csl transcriptional repression of notch target genes  <cit> . of note, though both nicd and snail proteins are known to play a central role in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis, notch signaling is also capable of inhibiting hcc tumor growth through the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> .

in this study, we have identified nicd as a novel snail binding partner by using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry  in hcc cells. using hcc cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts , we demonstrate that nicd can induce snail degradation and impede snail-dependent cell invasion. although snail is known to be degraded by the β-trcp <dig> and fbxl <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, our data indicate that nicd-mediated snail degradation may instead be dependent on mdm <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
nicd is a novel binding partner of snail
to elucidate regulatory factors of snail, we sought to identify its binding partners by performing ms/ms . we identified notch <dig> as a snail-associated protein  and confirmed an endogenous snail and notch <dig> interaction by performing coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays . in both analyses, the size of the detected notch <dig> protein was approximately between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, suggesting that snail binds to the proteolytically cleaved intracellular domain of notch <dig>  known as nicd. using the duolink ii assay , we have shown that endogenous snail and notch <dig> proteins interact in multiple cancer lines . colocalization of nicd and snail in nuclear foci by immunofluorescence corroborates the interaction of the two proteins .

the ank domain of nicd and the zinc finger domain of snail are required for nicd and snail interaction
nicd contains a rbp-j κ-associated module  domain, seven ankyrin/cdc <dig> repeats  domain, two nuclear localization signals, a transcriptional transactivation domain , a polyglutamine tract  domain and a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich  domain  <cit>  . snail contains a highly conserved c-terminal region, a zf domain and a divergent n-terminal  domain   <cit> . we mapped interacting domains of nicd and snail by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using deletion mutants of both proteins and found that the snail zf domain and the nicd ank domain were responsible for the interaction between the two molecules . to exclude the possibility that altered cellular localization was responsible for the inability of the snail-Δzf mutant to bind nicd, we performed glutathione s-transferase  pull-down assays using gst-snail wild-type , Δzf and zf mutants, which showed that only the snail-Δzf mutant did not interact with nicd .

nicd downregulates snail protein
to clarify the role of the interaction between nicd and snail, we transfected hep3b cells with hemagglutinin -snail and myc-nicd constructs. interestingly, we observed that the ha-snail protein was dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of myc-nicd . under the same experimental conditions in which nicd and snail were coexpressed, there was no change in the level of snail mrna in comparison with cells that expressed ha-snail alone . furthermore, we performed additional experiments using endogenous snail protein-upregulated conditions. in our previous study, reactive oxygen species  stress such as h2o <dig> treatment-upregulated snail mrna and protein expression  <cit> . in the h2o2-treated cells, myc-nicd downregulated the snail protein level, not the mrna level, although in normal conditions myc-nicd upregulated snail mrna expression . collectively, these results suggest that nicd may decrease snail expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism.

nicd induces degradation of the snail protein by ubiquitination
nicd-induced decrease of snail protein was inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  suggesting that nicd promotes snail degradation . treatment of snail and nicd cotransfected cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, revealed that the protein half-life of snail is shortened in the presence of nicd . as snail is known to be tagged by ubiquitin for proteolytic degradation, we sought to determine whether nicd could induce snail ubiquitination by examining ubiquitinated snail in cells cotransfected with flag-snail and myc-nicd wt or myc-nicd Δank mutant . because nicd Δank mut does not interact with the snail protein, we hypothesized that snail would not be ubiquitinated in its presence. in agreement with this hypothesis, ubiquitinated flag-snail was detected only in flag-snail and myc-nicd wt cotransfected cells and not in flag-snail and Δank mut transfected cells . these data support a role for nicd in regulating ubiquitin-dependent snail degradation.

coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that myc-nicd can interact with mdm <dig> . in a previous report, we found that snail may also bind mdm <dig>   <cit> . these data support the notion that nicd induces degradation of the snail protein via mdm2-mediated ubiquitination because nicd has no known intrinsic e <dig> ligase function. indeed, in hep3b cells cotransfected with myc-nicd and mdm <dig> sirna, nicd-induced snail degradation was decreased compared to control sirna-transfected cells . glycogen synthase kinase 3β  is known to induce snail phosphorylation and degradation through the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase β-trcp <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether nicd-induced snail degradation is reliant on gsk-3β/β-trcp <dig>  we analyzed the protein level of the snail 2sa mutant, which has two point mutations in the β-trcp motif, in cells cotransfected with snail 2sa mutant and nicd. we found that both the snail wt and 2sa mutant proteins were uniformly degraded by nicd, implying that nicd-induced snail degradation is a β-trcp-independent phenomenon .

nicd induces degradation of endogenous snail protein
to determine whether nicd could regulate endogenous levels of snail protein, we treated hep3b and huh <dig> cells with notch <dig> sirna to silence nicd expression. in notch <dig> sirna-transfected cells, endogenous snail protein levels were elevated relative to control sirna-transfected cells . we confirmed these results using a murine stem cell virus  retroviral system to express nicd  in mefs and hep3b cells. in both cell types, nicd expression led to decreased levels of endogenous snail protein but upregulation of p <dig>  an established notch target gene . correspondingly, expression of jagged <dig>  an activating ligand of notch signaling, repressed snail protein levels only in the absence of dapt -l-alanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), a γ-secretase inhibitor . taken together, our results thus far show that physiological activation of the notch pathway or nicd expression is necessary and sufficient for snail degradation.

snail and nicd regulate the invasiveness of hcc cells
to understand the function of the nicd-snail interaction, we infected primary mefs with the mscv driving myc-nicd and/or flag-snail genes and evaluated snail protein levels. predictably, in myc-nicd and flag-snail coinfected samples, nicd-induced snail degradation was observed . given that notch <dig> and snail signaling individually regulate cell invasion, we considered whether their interaction might perturb their native functions  <cit> . using a cell invasion assay, we found that the number of invading snail and nicd coinfected cells was significantly less than that of cells infected by snail or nicd alone . parallel findings were observed in huh <dig> and hep3b cells in which coexpression of snail and nicd suppressed invasiveness . additionally, the number of invading cells was much greater in cells that had been transfected with notch <dig> sirna than those transfected with control sirna . however, the number of invading cells transfected with both notch <dig> and snail sirnas did not increase .

to test whether nicd specifically inhibits snail-induced cell invasion, we performed invasion assays in nicd and/or snail sirna-transfected hep3b cells after treatment with h2o <dig>  as portrayed in figure 6e, we found that h2o2-treated cells ectopically expressing nicd were less invasive than h2o2-treated control cells, which correlates with the ability of nicd to inhibit h2o2-dependent upregulation of snail expression . however, in h2o2-treated cells cotransfected with snail sirna, nicd expression lacked any effect on cell invasion . taken together, these results demonstrate that nicd can inhibit snail-induced cell invasion.

discussion
previously, notch <dig> was shown to cooperate with the snail pathway by upregulating snail transcription, inducing emt and promoting hypoxia-induced tumor cell invasion  <cit> . however, we found that nicd, which is an intracellular functional molecule liberated from notch <dig>  can suppress snail protein via direct binding. this suggests that the notch1-snail pathway includes not only the single functional pathway but also a reciprocal interrelationship. although both nicd and snail protein play a central role in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis  <cit> , their physical interaction has not been described previously. given the highly invasive phenotype of hcc and the overexpression of snail in hcc tissue  <cit> , we utilized hcc cell lines as a model cell system in which to study the functional involvement of nicd-snail interaction in disease development.

notch <dig> is known to regulate snail and slug mrna levels, but efforts have not been made to examine alternative functions of nicd and snail expression in the same cancer cell line  <cit> . in this study, we have demonstrated the ability of nicd to associate with snail to induce its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. nicd has been reported to upregulate snail activity by inducing snail mrna expression under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . in addition, notch <dig> is related to the mesenchymal program by activating snail expression in cardiac development  <cit> . our findings appear to be inconsistent with these previous results. however, because notch signals and cellular functions vary according to cell type and cellular environment, these inconsistencies could be caused by the different cell types and conditions. although ectopic expression of nicd slightly induced snail transcription, we postulate that the genetic interaction between snail and nicd and their physical association may be physiologically exclusive events, which may account for their contrasting cellular effects. in our previous study, ros stress upregulated snail mrna and protein expression  <cit> . in the ros-treated cells, myc-nicd downregulated the snail protein level, not the mrna level . these latter data indicate that, under conditions of exogenous snail expression or endogenous snail upregulation by ros stress, nicd reduces snail protein levels by inducing snail degradation without affecting snail transcription. because the nicd Δank mutant failed to induce ubiquitination and degradation of snail, it appears that the physical interaction of nicd and snail is required for the degenerative process. nicd is not known to have inherent e <dig> ligase functions, indicating that nicd may initiate or serve as a cofactor of the degradation signal. we have shown that myc-nicd interacts with mdm <dig> , but the nicd Δank mutant did not . in addition, in mdm <dig> sirna-transfected cells, nicd-induced snail degradation was decreased compared to control sirna-transfected cells , suggesting that mdm <dig> has a role in nicd-induced snail degradation.

we attempted to improve the transient transfection conditions with a stably nicd-expressing cell line based on a retroviral expression system. in these cells, the expression levels of nicd were much lower than those found with transient transfection. as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> nicd-induced snail degradation occurred in our stably nicd-expressing cells. in addition, to show that ligand-stimulated, nicd-induced snail degradation took place, we used the cell line that expressed the exogenous jagged <dig> ligand. in these cells, nicd induced snail degradation . moreover, notch <dig> sirna upregulated endogenous snail protein levels, as shown in figure 5a. these data suggest that nicd-induced snail degradation occurs in certain physiological conditions.

in this study, nicd-induced degradation of snail inhibited snail-dependent invasive behavior, as expected. consistent with these invasion data, e-cadherin expression decreased in snail-overexpressed cells, but it did not in snail- and nicd-coexpressed cells compared to control cells . in our previous study, we reported p53-induced snail degradation via mdm <dig>  <cit> . notch <dig> expression and signaling were regulated differently, depending on p <dig> status  <cit> . in other systems, notch <dig> related to the mesenchymal program by activating snail expression  <cit> . in another previous study, we showed that notch <dig> and snail differentially regulate invasion of hcc cells depending on p <dig> status  <cit> . the inhibition of invasion by nicd and snail coexpression was observed in both hep3b cells  and huh <dig> cells . on the other hand, in p <dig> wt cells such as hepg <dig>  nicd and snail coexpression promotes invasiveness  <cit> . in the present study, we showed nicd regulated invasion via snail degradation in p53-null or p53-mutant status. on the basis of these reports, we suspect that the interactions among p <dig>  mdm <dig>  notch <dig> and snail play an important role in emt. furthermore, these data explain the context-dependent regulation of emt by the notch signaling system. our study provides one clue for understanding the complex regulation mechanism of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  notch <dig> and snail in the emt process. the regulation of these proteins and their physiological contribution to hcc development and malignant behavior require further investigation. however, the mechanism that we have described presents substantial evidence of cross-interference between the notch and snail signaling pathways, which is mediated by their direct binding.

CONCLUSIONS
herein we have identified nicd as a novel binding partner of snail. our results indicate that the interaction between nicd and snail promotes snail ubiquitination and degradation through an mdm2-dependent mechanism. accordingly, we have shown that nicd impairs snail-associated cell invasion in a conserved manner between mefs and hcc cells. these findings collectively suggest that in the instance in which notch <dig> and snail are conjointly present, notch signaling may serve as an antagonist of snail function. the results of our research ultimately support caution in the use of genetic or pharmacological strategies that solely target the notch pathway for therapeutic treatment in snail-associated hcc. further investigation is warranted to fully determine the precise cellular processes disrupted by notch inhibition and thus to better assess the therapeutic value and clinical implications of notch pathway antagonists.
