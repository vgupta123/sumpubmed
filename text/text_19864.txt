BACKGROUND
water contamination with human enteric viruses is a growing concern, because the dissemination of human enteric viruses in reservoir, river water and seawater could pose human health risks for infectious viral diseases via drinking water  <cit> , recreation water  <cit> , irrigation water  <cit> , marine cultured products  <cit> , and so on. the quantity of infectious enteric viruses in water, which has to be accurately determined for assessing risks of waterborne viral diseases, is often very difficult to analyze, because of the low concentration of enteric viruses in water environments  <cit> , the inability of molecular detection methods to distinguish infectious and non-infectious virions  <cit> , and the presence of inhibitory substances for the processes of genome extraction and amplification  <cit> . reasonable and facile methodologies for recovering and quantifying infectious enteric viruses in environmental samples are needed to address the issues of waterborne viral infectious diseases.

one rationalized approach to collect infectious virions from environmental samples would be the employment of viral antigen recovery methods by using virus-specific antibodies  <cit> . the integrity of viral capsid structure, including antigenic sites, is prerequisite to maintain infectivity, and viral particles bound to specific antibodies might be structurally intact. however, diverse enteric viruses in caliciviridae, picornaviridae and reoviridae have been recognized as waterborne agents  <cit> , and antibody may be too specific to capture all possible strains of a target virus  <cit> . the preparation of an array of antibodies for each enteric virus of interest would be enormously costly and unrealistic. the discovery of alternative viral adsorbents, which have a broad binding spectrum to enteric viruses and ensure the infectivity of recovered virions, could be very valuable for accurately investigating health risks posed by infectious enteric viruses in water environments.

virus-binding proteins, which were discovered from a bacterial culture derived from activated sludge  <cit> , could be alternative viral adsorbents, because these bacterial proteins can stably interact with human viral particles  <cit> . recently, norovirus-binding proteins  were acquired with an affinity to a norovirus  capsid peptide  <cit> . it was expected that these novbps, which are derived from homologues of a chaperonin protein groel, had a binding capability to several nov genotypes, presumably because of the critical role of hydrophobic effect  <cit> . this feature of a broad binding spectrum has raised the expectation that the acquired novbps might be utilized as adsorbents for the recovery and detection of multiple genotypes of nov in environmental samples. furthermore, the main contribution of hydrophobic effect might allow us to utilize these proteins as adsorbents for other enteric viruses, if non-specific interactions of these proteins with impurities in environmental samples are well excluded.

in this study, a gene of novbp was acquired from an extracted genomic dna of activated sludge microorganisms, and the adsorption characteristics of the gene product  to particles of enteric viruses were investigated. values of the equilibrium dissociation constant were estimated with quarts crystal microbalance  method. furthermore, the interaction between the evbp candidate and enteric virus particles, including nov genotypes gi. <dig>  gii. <dig>  gii. <dig>  gii. <dig>  group a rotavirus  and poliovirus type  <dig>  , was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . based on these binding assays, the applicability of the gene product as evbp was discussed.

RESULTS
production and purification of the evbp candidate
a gene coding the candidate of evbp was acquired from the extracted genomic dna of activated sludge microorganisms with nested pcr . the estimated molecular weight of the protein is  <dig> kda. it was confirmed by blast search that the isolated gene codes a homologue of a chaperonin groel monomer. figure  <dig> shows the sds-page profile of extracted soluble proteins from e. coli cells transformed by pdest17/ti/evbp and the evbp candidate purified with nickel ion-immobilized affinity chromatography. strong expression of a protein with a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda was observed in the extracted soluble proteins from e. coli cells . this protein seemed to be histidine-tagged, because it was easily purified by nickel ion-immobilized column . these results indicate that the production and purification of the evbp candidate were successfully performed. the recovery of the target his-tag protein as a soluble protein enormously facilitates the protein processing, because it is not necessary to purify and solubilize inclusion bodies in e. coli cells.

equilibrium dissociation constant estimated with qcm
binding assay of the evbp candidate with enteric virus particles by elisa
in order to confirm the binding capability of the evbp candidate to enteric viruses, elisa using particles of pv <dig>  rv-a, nov gi. <dig>  gii <dig>  gii. <dig>  and gii. <dig> was conducted. the binding assay of a native groel, a tetradecamer molecule , was also performed in order to investigate the influence of the complex formation on virus-binding ability. the evbp candidate and groel complex were biotinylated prior to the binding assays, and the binding of biotinylated proteins to immobilized viral particles was detected in elisa with avidin carrying horseradish peroxidase.

discussion
the present study investigated the applicability of evbp as a viral adsorbent for diverse enteric viruses in families of picornaviridae, caliciviridae and reoviridae, which are dominant etiological agents of gastroenteritis cases all over the world  <cit> . a broad binding spectrum to human enteric viruses with a sufficient binding affinity is an indispensable binding characteristic of evbp for utilizing it as a virus adsorbent. however, too low binding specificity is not preferred, because it would cause the non-specific adsorption of impurities co-recovered with viral particles from environmental samples, which must hamper the interaction between evbp and viral particles.

a monomer of a chaperon protein groel was regarded as an evbp candidate in this study. figure  <dig> shows three dimensional model of evbp, estimated by swiss-model, showing that hydrophobic residues are widely distributed on its surface. meanwhile, the native groel complex, composed of  <dig> identical monomers  <cit> , is involved in the folding of denatured proteins and de novo proteins just after translation  <cit> . groel can interact with denatured proteins that are exposing hydrophobic amino acid residues  <cit> , thus having a relatively broad spectrum of binding to thousands of protein that have different amino acid sequences and conformations  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  hydrophobic residues are also widely distributed on the surface of the native groel complex  <cit> . since the groel complex can participate in the hydrophobic interactions  <cit> , the difference in the binding affinity observed in figure  <dig> could be attributable to the configurations in each protein. the c-terminal hydrophobic region of nov capsid protein faces the hollows on the surface of the nov particle  <cit> , therefore, the groel complex could be too large to interact with the hydrophobic region. the hollow on the nov particle surface has a depth of  <dig> Å and a diameter of  <dig> Å  <cit> , while the groel complex has a height of  <dig> Å and a diameter of  <dig> Å  <cit> . since the size of canyon on the capsid surface of pv is 12Å deep and  <dig> Å wide  <cit> , the steric hindrance would be also significant when the groel complex interacts with the hydrophobic surface of the canyon rim of pv capsid protein. the association of the groel complex with the shoulder surface of vp <dig> spike protein of rv would be also difficult, because the height of the spike is  <dig> Å  <cit> , about one third of the diameter of the groel complex molecule. the small molecule of groel monomer  must have an advantage in the access to the surface of viral particles with rugged structure.

although the utilization of evbp in the detection of enteric viruses from environmental samples was emphasized in this study, there are also possible applications of evbp in virus detection from clinical samples, especially in the first screening for diagnostics of gastroenteritis. it would be possible to utilize evbp as a ligand in chromatography and protein microarray techniques  <cit> . the display on bacterial cell surface  <cit>  and the immobilization on carriers  <cit>  could also facilitate the application of this protein as a viral adsorbent in clinical settings. the key aspect in the utilization of evbp is to curb the non-specific interactions with impurities in clinical and environmental samples, because the hydrophobic effect is likely to be the main factor in the binding between viral particles and evbp. appropriate blocking reagents would be required when evbp is utilized as a detection probe for enteric viruses. bsa was employed as a blocking reagent in the elisa, and it was found that the binding of evbp to bsa is negligible.

the binding spectrum of evbp indicated in this study could be broader than that of histo-blood group antigens  specific to human norovirus  <cit> , because other enteric viruses such as enterovirus and rotavirus are not using hbgas as primary receptors on susceptible cells. the employment of porcine gastric mucin including hbgas  <cit>  could be able to capture other enteric viruses because of the presence of adhesive glycoproteins in mucin, although the non-specific adsorption of impurities also has to be overcome in the usage of mammalian gastric mucin as a viral adsorbent. since ph, ionic strength and ion composition in surrounding water are ruling the adsorption of viral particles  <cit> , it is important to take the measure of natural substances with the propensity to adhere to evbp in various conditions in the further study. these efforts would offer new techniques using this novel adsorbent for detecting diverse enteric viruses from clinical and environmental samples.

CONCLUSIONS
evbp that has a broad binding spectrum to enteric viruses was newly discovered. evbp is derived from a monomer of a bacterial chaperon protein groel, and this small hydrophobic protein molecule of evbp could have an advantage in the access to the surface of viral particles with rugged structure. the broad binding characteristic of evbp would allow us to utilize it as a novel adsorbent for detecting diverse enteric viruses in clinical and environmental samples.
