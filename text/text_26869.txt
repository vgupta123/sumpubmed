BACKGROUND
the genetic maps of grass species have been constructed using a variety of marker types. most of the older species-specific molecular maps were constructed with rflp markers, but in recent times there has been increased utilization of pcr-based markers because of accessibility and higher throughput. conservation of gene content and order has been detected among grass genomes through the use of comparative maps  <cit> . the applications of comparative maps have been discussed many times in the past , however genetic maps are not always designed with a comparative study in mind, thus, current maps from different grass species  seldom share an adequate number of common  markers to allow researchers to bridge across maps with an adequate resolution. this is especially true when comparing the genome maps of the triticeae tribe with the maps of rice or maize, which on average share  <dig> to  <dig> markers per wheat homoeologous chromosome group. the lack of anchor markers for bridging across species is exacerbated as new maps are constructed using pcr-based markers such as aflp, genomic microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms  rather than the transferable but laborious cdna-based rflp markers.

genomic ssr  markers are biased towards genome specificity  <cit>  and generally do not transfer to other species, making them less useful for the generation of comparative maps. for comparative mapping, markers must identify orthologous loci and be polymorphic in two or more species  <cit> .

recently, several researchers  <cit>  have addressed the lack of transferability of gssrs to other genomes by limiting primer design to transcribed regions, that are expected to have higher levels of conservation across related organisms. public est sequence databases from the poaceae family can be scanned for the presence of ssrs both in protein-coding regions and in untranslated regions of genes .

when compared to gssrs, est derived ssrs  were less polymorphic in a study in hexaploid wheat  <cit>  with only 25% polymorphism, but the successful markers were of high quality and were also polymorphic in durum wheat. thiel  <cit>  reported a higher level of polymorphism in barley . lower polymorphism requires more effort to design primers for testing a larger set of candidate markers, but the ease and speed of finding ssrs among freely available est sequence data offsets this extra effort. this approach is only feasible in species for which there have been est sequencing projects.

we used the rice genome sequence generated by the international rice genome sequence project   <cit>  to identify gssrs that can potentially serve as sources of markers for mapping. in an equivalent experiment, non-redundant sets of transcript sequences from rice, wheat and barley were scanned  and those transcripts containing ssrs were collected and mapped in-silico to the rice genome. ssr-containing transcripts derived from different species, sharing a pre-determined threshold of similarity and matching the same location in rice were considered putative orthologs that may be used as anchors in comparative mapping studies.

this paper describes a methodology for developing est-ssr markers from wheat, barley and rice as markers for developing independent species maps as well as for homologous anchor markers for comparative maps. over  <dig>  untested pcr primer pairs for est-ssrs were generated from the three gene indices and made available to the research community interested in grass genomes. researchers are encouraged to evaluate a subset of primer pairs and send feedback regarding their utility to the graingenes  <cit>  database for posting. the list  is available from the additional files as well as from the triticeae est-ssr coordination webpage in graingenes  <cit> .

RESULTS
frequency of microsatellite types and motifs
based on combinations of all four nucleotides, the canonical set of ssr motifs is represented by four different duplets ,  <dig> different triplets,  <dig> different quadruplets and  <dig> different quintuplet motifs. in the source sequences, all these basic nucleotide motifs can be represented in variant forms of the same basic set or by their reverse complements but to keep a consistency in the database for estimating frequencies, they were transformed into the canonical motifs. reverse complements and variants would include, for example, ct for ag and gag for agg. sets of unigene sequences such as the tigr gene indices have the advantage of built-in elimination of redundant ssr counts allowing for more precise estimates of est-ssr frequency. the rice genomic ssr  counts were processed a-posteriori to eliminate redundancy due to bac/pac clone overlaps . mononucleotide repeats are common in genomic dna and some are known to be polymorphic but these were deliberately avoided in the unigene database, because they are usually added by the rna polymerase and are not present in the template dna .

ests are a rich source of ssrs
the abundance of ssrs  in the unigenes can range from one in every  <dig> to one in every two unigenes depending on the minimum length . when all ssrs with a minimum length of  <dig> bp are tabulated, 50%, 36% and 31% of rice, barley and wheat unigenes have at least one ssr. when the minimum length was raised to  <dig> bp the proportion was reduced to  <dig>   <dig> and 8%, respectively. rice unigenes had a higher frequency of ssrs than did barley and wheat for most minimum lengths, but not for ssrs longer than  <dig> bp, where the relative abundance was similar in all three gene indices. the nearly two-fold difference at a minimum length of  <dig> bp was mostly due to the high abundance of trinucleotide ssrs in rice unigenes relative to wheat and barley. the abundance of trinucleotide repeats decreased by about one half for each repeat unit added to the series. the decline in abundance was steeper for tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats but was less than one half for dinucleotide repeats, which at lengths greater than or equal to  <dig> bp, became the predominant type in all datasets. at  <dig> bp or longer, the at motif was most common among gssrs while ag was more numerous among est-ssrs motifs .

wheat unigenes contained a larger number of ssrs for all repeat length categories, followed by rice and barley unigenes. this is probably because wheat has more than twice the number of unigenes than rice or barley with  <dig>  for wheat,  <dig>  for rice and  <dig>  for barley. the larger number of unigenes in hexaploid wheat may result from divergence of the genes in the three genomes, but also from a relatively larger est dataset, i.e., more ests have been sequenced for wheat, with a sequence redundancy of  <dig> ×, versus 6× and  <dig> × for barley and rice, respectively .

the number of the ten most frequent motifs was tabulated for different minimal ssr lengths . the relative proportions of motifs fluctuated with different length constraints as well as source species. at a minimum ssr length of  <dig> bp, ccg was predominant in all datasets, but at and ag were more frequent in the higher range of minimal ssr lengths. among dinucleotides in the rice est-ssrs, ag and at were the most common, but ag and ac were more common in wheat and barley est-ssrs. besides ccg, other frequent trinucleotide motifs were agg and agc. the trinucleotide n microsatellite was present in both coding regions and utrs. in coding regions, this triplet has the potential to code for the amino acids proline , arginine , alanine , glycine , but among these, expansion of the motif leading to additions of the amino acid proline could have the strongest effects on protein structure while alanine and glycine would have relatively small effects.

the longest ssrs were genomic microsatellites . unigenes had few ssrs longer than  <dig> bp, up to  <dig> bp in wheat ests. often these were not useful for developing ssr markers because no flanking sequence was available to design primers. the overall mean length for rice gssrs equal to or longer than  <dig> bp was  <dig>  , with no significant differences in mean gssr lengths among the chromosomes in rice, while the mean length for est-ssrs was  <dig>   with no significant differences among the three species gene indices .

density of gssrs and comparison to est-ssrs mapped in silico in rice chromosome 1
the contiguity of the pseudomolecule sequence of rice chromosome  <dig>  , with only eight gaps for the whole chromosome, provided a convenient framework of coordinates for calculating density estimates of gssrs features , and for anchoring rice, wheat and barley unigenes associated with microsatellites . best similarity matches between the rice genome and  <dig>  barley,  <dig>  rice and  <dig>  wheat est-ssr unigenes were identified using blastn. from these, a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs mapped to r <dig> pseudomolecules including  <dig>  from barley,  <dig>  from rice and  <dig>  from wheat with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % average sequence similarity respectively.

density of gssrs equal to or longer than  <dig> bp in r <dig> ranged from  <dig> gssr in  <dig>  kbp near the centromere to  <dig> gssr per  <dig>  kbp in the distal regions . for a more stringent subset of gssrs , the density ranged from  <dig> gssr in  <dig> kbp around the centromere to  <dig> gssr in  <dig>  kbp in the densest region of the short arm .

the comparison of the density of gssrs to, a) the density of all rice unigenes mapped to r <dig>  and b) the density of est-ssrs  mapped to r <dig> provided an estimate of the relationship between gssrs and gene regions in the rice genome. there was a striking resemblance in the patterns of the plots for the density of gssrs and the density of unigene-derived est-ssrs in r <dig> pseudomolecules . the similarity in density patterns was less apparent but still present between gssrs and r <dig> matches to all rice unigenes , and these densities were significantly correlated .

a decomposition of the set of stringent gssrs  by types in r <dig>  showed that the relative proportions of the pentanucleotide gssrs ≥  <dig> bp were consistently lower over the majority of the chromosome, while the proportion of the other three types of microsatellites was higher, indicating that pentanucleotides are only a small component in the non-homogeneous distribution of the stringent subset.

development of primers for cereal est-ssrs
we designed primer pairs for  <dig>  wheat,  <dig>  barley and  <dig>  rice est-ssrs conforming to the stringent restrictions described in the methods. the average product size expected from the set of designed primers was  <dig> bp for rice est-ssrs,  <dig> for wheat and  <dig>  for barley.

of those est-ssrs, 42% of the wheat and 56% of the barley were mapped in-silico to the rice genome. the additional file  <dig> contains the list of primer pairs that can be downloaded for testing.

discussion
are microsatellites preferentially associated with gene-rich dna in rice?
morgante and colleagues  <cit>  reported that in plants, gssrs were preferentially associated with non-repetitive dna such as the gene-rich regions. they found a highly significant, positive, linear relationship  between genomic microsatellite frequency and the percentage of single copy dna in several plant species with a wide range of genome sizes. estimates of repetitive and non-repetitive single-copy dna fractions were based on reviews of the literature describing renaturation kinetics experiments for each of the species. plant species that have gone through genome expansion due to retrotransposon amplification, such as maize and wheat, had a lower genomic microsatellite frequency indicating that ssr frequency is not a function of overall genome size but rather the relative proportion of single-copy dna.

in this study, the best similarity matches between rice unigene sequences and the genomic sequence of rice chromosome  <dig> were used to estimate the density of transcribed regions along r <dig>  this estimate was compared to both the density of gssrs and the density of est-ssrs . the density pattern of transcribed regions  and of ssrs within transcribed regions  followed closely the density pattern of gssrs in rice chromosome  <dig>  .

the density  of gssrs along r <dig> was higher than both the density of transcribed regions and the density of est-ssrs. a large number of gssrs that are not already included in the set of est-ssrs could still be associated with genes because, as figure 1b suggests, they are preferentially found in genic regions near promoter regions or inside introns and away from the highly repetitive and gene-poor dna in heterochromatin. in rice, n ssrs are rare among ests, but are the most common gssrs among the long group . the n ssr motif is frequently found along with sequences of the micropon family of mites  <cit>  which are associated with gene-rich regions.

other reports have documented a role for ssrs that are associated with genes in the control of gene expression. for example, several human diseases have been linked with events of triplet expansions in the past  <cit> . chromatin remodeling and gene silencing via histone-deacetylation/cytosine-methylation are among the putative functions of ssrs in the vicinity of genes, especially if gc rich. coffee  <cit>  showed that histone deacetylation  leading to lower expression at the fmr <dig> locus in fragile x was a consequence of ccg repeat expansion. in another example, the expansion of a n ssr in the 3' utr of the myotonic dystrophy  protein kinase gene could potentially affect the expression due to changes in local chromatin structure  <cit> . it has been found that dm patients have a reduced or complete loss of a nuclease-hypersensitive site in the region of the gene. further analysis showed that the majority of dm protein kinase transcripts from cells carrying the repeat expansion also lacked the last two exons of a normal transcript, showing that the repeat expansions affected the splicing at the 3' end.

in rice, although the presence of a single-base mutation breaking an intron splice site is more directly responsible for the difference in phenotypes of the waxy gene, polymorphism due to ssr expansion has been associated with variation of expression levels in different japonica and indica varieties  <cit> . the effect that microsatellites might have in gene expression in plants may be observed as natural phenotypic variation.

a strategy to exploit the est database for microsatellite markers
one strategy to better exploit a database of est-ssrs in order to find polymorphic markers is to first sample the longest ssrs , favoring dinucleotide repeats, then follow with trinucleotide, tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats  <cit> . after exhausting the longest ssrs, one would then proceed with another cycle to select shorter ssrs. short trinucleotide-based microsatellites such as n, the most abundant group overall , are more likely to derive from coding regions, thus reducing the chances for finding polymorphism  <cit> . this strategy is based on the following observations from our results and the literature: 1) dinucleotides are a better source of polymorphic markers than the other types  <cit> . 2) longer ssrs generally have a higher tendency to be polymorphic  <cit> . 3) ssrs deriving from utrs have the potential for a higher polymorphism than those derived from coding regions, which are constrained by purifying selection  <cit> .

one percent of unigenes from the three species examined in this study have ssrs starting with a minimum of  <dig> bp . overall,  <dig> wheat unigenes,  <dig> rice unigenes and  <dig> barley unigenes contain at least one of these long microsatellites and primer pairs were successfully designed for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of these long est-ssrs in wheat, rice and barley, respectively. at this minimum length, trinucleotide repeats were not the most frequent. nearly 50% of the est-ssrs longer than  <dig> bp were based on dinucleotide repeats , with n being the most common motif . yet, the frequency of ssr types among those for which primers could be designed did not follow this pattern. trinucleotide repeats were still the most common type in this group, followed by dinucleotides. this was due to the fact that dinucleotides are found preferentially in the utrs of transcripts, and their sequences had fewer surrounding bases to anchor acceptable primers.

after relaxing the microsatellite length constraint to a minimum of  <dig> bp, the overall number of ssrs in the unigenes increased to around 5%. an additional  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  est-ssrs in wheat, rice and barley become available for primer design. acceptable primer pairs were designed for  <dig>  wheat,  <dig>  rice and  <dig>  barley est-ssrs in this category .

the set of est-ssrs with acceptable primer pairs  were selected from among all dinucleotide and trinucleotide est-ssrs with a minimum of  <dig> bp, tetranucleotide est-ssrs longer than  <dig> bp and pentanucleotide est-ssrs  <dig> bp or longer. however, from  <dig>  wheat unigenes associated with microsatellites and having a set of pcr primers in our database, only  <dig>  had a best match in the rice bac/pacs with our stringency settings. the rest  are not anchored to the rice genome but still have potential to provide polymorphic wheat microsatellite markers. the same applies to 44% of the barley est-ssrs with acceptable primers. the reasons for a large number of wheat/barley unigenes without matches to rice genomic sequence include not having the complete sequence of the rice genome available  and having a relatively high stringency setting for filtering wheat and barley sequence comparisons to rice. in previous comparisons between wheat est unigenes and the same version of the rice genome sequence draft  <cit> , we found that 40% of the unigenes did not significantly match a sequence in the rice genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the relative proportions of di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta nucleotide repeats and motifs varied widely depending on length and were not consistent among the species examined. we have shown that ests are a good source of ssrs that can be exploited to develop microsatellite markers for wheat, barley and rice. the advantage to this approach is that the sequences are already available resulting in a lower cost than designing and testing microsatellites from anonymous genomic libraries, even if the polymorphism rate for est-derived markers is lower.

est-ssrs are useful for enhancing individual species maps, but can be used as anchor probes for creating links between maps in comparative studies when designed from sets of orthologous genes, as demonstrated by yu et al  <cit> . the annotation and/or the sequence similarity between putative orthologous genes from two related species can provide the basis for their use in comparative maps. more than  <dig>  primer pairs were designed to amplify fragments from a stringent subset of est-ssrs in wheat, rice and barley and are available to the public for testing.

using a different methodology, our results substantiated the report by morgante et al  <cit>  suggesting that microsatellites are predominantly found in the vicinity of genes. in some instances, their presence in the vicinity of genes may implicate a regulating function by mechanisms involving chromatin remodelling and dna methylation.
