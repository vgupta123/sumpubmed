BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria. most bacteriocins are generally synthesized as prepeptides and can be classified into several classes depending on their post-translational processing and the mode of action  <cit> . type i bacteriocins, of which a nisin is most well-known, undergo post-translational modifications such as formation of dehydrated residues and lanthionine bridges  <cit> . in contrast, type iia bacteriocins are matured by simple cleavage of a leader peptide and characterized by a conserved ygngvxc motif in the n-terminus  <cit> . these bacteriocins contain 37~ <dig> residues and show potent activity against related gram-positive bacteria, e.g. listeria spp.  <cit> . nmr studies revealed that type iia bacteriocins consists of two domains, a cationic n-terminal domain and a hydrophobic c-terminal domain  <cit> : the n-terminal domain interacts with the anionic cell surface of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> , while the c-terminal domain participates in the membrane permeabilization  <cit> .

in general, type iia bacteriocins are coexpressed with cognate immunity proteins  composed of 88~ <dig> amino acids, in order to protect the organism from the antimicrobial activity of its own bacteriocin  <cit> . it is known that the immunity proteins usually exhibit high specificity against their cognate bacteriocins. in contrast to the type iia bacteriocins that exhibit high sequence conservation in their n-terminus, the degree of sequence homology between the pediocin-like immunity proteins varies , which provides the basis for classification of them into three subgroups   <cit> . the mode of action of immunity proteins and the basis of their specificity is still unclear, although the c-terminal half of immunity proteins is known as an important determinant for the specific recognition of their cognate bacteriocins  <cit> . however, because pediocin-like immunity proteins don't interact directly with their cognate bacteriocins  <cit>  and exist in cytoplasm  <cit> , it has been proposed that they may act by interfering with the formation of a functional pore complex in the membrane or blocking the pore itself. the accumulated structural information for certain class of immunity proteins could generally provide an important clue to their mode of action. however, although a number of pediocin-like immunity proteins have been identified and characterized, so far, only two structures have been reported: immunity proteins conferring immunity to enterocin a   <cit>  which belongs to subgroup a, and carnobacteriocin b <dig>   <cit>  which belongs to subgroup c.

pediocin secreted by pediococcus spp. is a representative of the type iia bacteriocins. among pediocins, pediocin pa- <dig> and its operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac <dig>  is the most well known  <cit> . recently, we identified another pediocin  operon  from pediococcus pentosaceus cbt- <dig>  which is isolated from the korean traditional fermentative food, kimchi. based on the remarkable degree of sequence identity  of pedb of p. pentosaceus to that of p. acidilactici, we regarded pedb as the immunity protein against pediocin pp- <dig>  pedb is a small positively charged protein with  <dig> amino acids and belongs to subgroup a. no transmembrane helices are predicted from sequence analysis. to provide a structural insight into the function of pedb, we determined the three dimensional structure of pedb at  <dig>  Å resolution and suggested the basis for the structural classification of pediocin-like immunity proteins, and examined the role of the c-terminal end of pedb.

RESULTS
pedb confers immunity to pediocin pp-1
we assumed pedb as an immunity protein to pediocin pp- <dig> on the basis of sequence identity to that of p. acidilactici  at a position of  <dig> exists between two pedb proteins for pediocin pp- <dig> and pediocin pa-1) . to investigate whether pedb confers immunity to pediocin pp- <dig>  we introduced the pedb gene into the bacteriocin-sensitive lactobacillus sakei ncfb  <dig> strain  <cit>  and tested the susceptibility against ammonium sulphate-precipitated fermentate of p. pentosaceus containing pediocin pp- <dig> . because the pedb gene doesn't have its own promoter, we used the promoter of soda encoding mn-containing superoxide dismutase in bacillus subtilis  <cit> . l. sakei harboring the pedb gene was about  <dig> times less susceptible compared to the strain possessing only the soda promoter, indicating that pedb successfully acted as the immunity protein to pediocin pp- <dig> . however, when pedb purified from e. coli was mixed with pediocin pp-l solution, pedb failed to inactivate the bacteriocin , which is in line with the previous report that pediocin-like immunity proteins don't directly interact with their cognate bacteriocins  <cit> .

overall structure of pedb
the native pedb and selenomethionine-substituted pedb mutant   were crystallized under similar conditions. the initial model was built according to the phased electron density map obtained by using anomalous scattering differences of selenium atoms in the selenomethionyl l24m crystal. a final model for native pedb was refined subsequently to  <dig>  Å resolution against native data. the native pedb crystals contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. out of the total  <dig> amino acids in native pedb, residues 7– <dig> are visible in the crystal structure. no significant structural difference was observed between the native and mutant pedb .

the crystal structure reveals that pedb forms a compact globular domain composed of four helices . they are arranged so that α <dig> and α <dig> run in the same direction and α <dig> and α <dig> in the opposite direction, forming an antiparallel four-helix bundle . the relative disposition of the four helices of pedb is maintained mainly by a network of hydrophobic interactions in the core of the molecule: phe <dig>  leu <dig>  and leu <dig> from α <dig> , leu <dig> from α <dig> , val <dig> and ile <dig> from α <dig> , leu <dig> and phe <dig> from the loop between α <dig> and α <dig>  leu <dig> and ile <dig> from α <dig>  form a hydrophobic core . this structure is further stabilized by several polar interactions between helices and between helix and loop: the side-chain of gln <dig> makes polar contact with glu <dig>  tyr <dig> with gln <dig>  gln <dig> with gln <dig>  tyr <dig> with asn <dig>  his <dig> with tyr <dig> and glu <dig> . the antiparallel helices are linked by a short loop of four to seven residues between them. the c-terminal end of pedb  that is thought to be important for immunity has no electron density, suggesting that this region is flexible. we could not find any oligomeric contacts between pedb monomers in crystal packing, which is consistent with the result that pedb exists as a monomer in solution .

structural comparison of pedb to enta-im and imb2
until now, two structures for pediocin-like immunity proteins, the crystal structure of enta-im  <cit>  and the solution structure of imb <dig>  <cit> , have been determined. although pedb exhibits a limited sequence identity to enta-im  and imb <dig>  , these three immunity proteins share an antiparallel left twisted four-helix bundle as a conserved scaffold. in addition, a positively charged region whose physiological function is obscure but which is commonly found in enta-im, imb <dig>  and even in the structure models of pediocin-like immunity proteins  <cit> , is also observed in the surface representation of pedb. in pedb, the positively charged region is formed by residues from α <dig>  and α <dig>  .

pediocin-like immunity proteins are divided into three subgroups on the basis of the sequence homology  <cit> . pedb and enta-im belong to the subgroup a, and imb <dig> belongs to the subgroup c. the fact that three immunity proteins share a common scaffold but are classified into different subgroups, aroused an interest in whether each subgroup has a conserved structural fingerprint. to test this, we compared the structure of pedb with those of enta-im and imb <dig>  respectively. as expected, the structure of pedb is well-superimposed to that of enta-im with r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for all cα atoms . they show a good agreement in the interhelical angles and length of helices. the structural similarity between pedb and enta-im is much higher than expected from the degree of sequence identity  <cit> .

in contrast, compared with pedb and enta-im, imb <dig> shows a considerable disparity in both the c-terminal end and the core structure. consistently, the r.m.s.d. value of  <dig>  Å between pedb and imb <dig> is higher than that of  <dig>  Å between pedb and enta-im. imb <dig> contains an additional helix at the c-terminus, whereas the c-termini of pedb and enta-im are flexible. in addition, the starting region  of the second helix of pedb and enta-im forms a  <dig> helix, which is not found in imb <dig> . the most remarkable structural difference in the four-helix bundle scaffold between pedb/enta-im  and imb <dig>  is observed in the local structure constructed by α <dig>  α <dig>  and a connecting loop. in pedb and enta-im, α <dig>  α <dig>  and a straightened loop between them form a triangle-like conformation with an interhelical angle of ~30° . two hydrophobic residues from the connecting loop  penetrate into the interhelical space between α <dig> and α <dig>  participating in hydrophobic core formation . as a result, the triangle-like conformation made by α <dig>  α <dig>  and the loop between them is stabilized. however, in imb <dig>  the connecting loop between α <dig> and α <dig> is not implicated in hydrophobic core formation. instead the loop is located outside the four helix bundle structure. consequently, α <dig> and α <dig> of imb <dig> is arranged in a nearly parallel manner, extensively contacting with each other along the helical axis . in conclusion, in spite of the overall similarity in structure, the difference of the c-terminal conformation and the local structure constructed by α <dig>  α <dig>  and the connecting loop between them can be used for the classification of pediocin-like immunity proteins.

extreme c-terminal end of pedb is essential for immunity
the fact that pedb and enta-im have almost identical four-helix bundle structures but their cognate bacteriocins are not identical , led us to hypothesize that the flexible c-terminus region of pedb is critical for specific recognition of pediocin pp- <dig>  actually, according to the sequence alignment between pedb and enta-im , the sequence conservation of this region is much lower than that of other region. in order to verify the role of the c-terminal end, we introduced several shortened pedbs  into l. sakei and tested the susceptibility to pediocin pp- <dig> 

as shown in figure 4a, deletion of last four residues  resulted in severe loss of immunity compared to the wild type pedb, and deletion of seven residues  almost completely abolished the activity. since the flexible c-terminal end is not involved in the folding of pedb, the deletion cannot disturb the core structure of pedb. actually, in the far-uv spectral region , the cd spectra of pedb variants were highly similar to that of the wild type pedb , which exhibits two negative bands at  <dig> and  <dig> nm supporting the all alpha helical structure of pedb  <cit> . furthermore, in the near-uv spectral region , pedb variants showed almost identical cd spectra to that of the wild type pedb , indicating that pedb and pedb variants have very similar tertiary structure. therefore, the mutant study indicates that the extreme c-terminus is crucial for the pedb immunity. interestingly, in the flexible c-terminal end, several polar or charged residues are located from the position of  <dig> . the significant loss of immunity on the deletion of extreme c-terminus suggests that polar interactions mediated by these polar or charged residues might be involved in the specific recognition of pediocin pp- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the  <dig>  Å crystal structure of pedb. the three pediocin-like immunity proteins whose structures are known  share a four helix bundle structure. in addition, the subgroup b immunity proteins, such as sakacin p and piscicolin  <dig>  <cit> , are also predicted to consist of four helices by secondary structure prediction using the jpred server  <cit>  , strongly suggesting that the four helix bundle is a conserved scaffold in the pediocin-like immunity proteins. the structural comparison among pediocin-like immunity proteins reveals that the c-terminal conformation and the local structure constructed by α <dig>  α <dig>  and the connecting loop between them exhibits a considerable disparity according to subgroup type, indicating that the pediocin-like immunity proteins could be classified into subgroups based on the structure as well as the sequence homology. the mode of action of pediocin-like immunity proteins still remains elusive. however, our results demonstrate that the extreme c-terminus of pedb with several charged residues is essential for immunity. further analysis about what is the membrane-bound receptor for type iia bacteriocins and how the recognition between the immunity proteins and cognate bacteriocins is achieved in a highly specific manner, is a great challenge in the future.
