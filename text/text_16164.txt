BACKGROUND
the extensive efforts directed towards identification of the gene transcription mechanisms controlling stem and progenitor cell differentiation have yielded a wealth of relevant information . much less is known about the complimentary mrna translation mechanisms that contribute to control of stem cell differentiation. the mrna-binding protein, musashi has been demonstrated to play a critical role in promoting stem cell self-renewal  <cit> . musashi has been implicated in the progression of numerous cancers including glioma, medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma, where it has been proposed to promote the self-renewal of cancer cells with stem cell–like properties  <cit> . musashi promotes both physiological and pathological stem cell self-renewal through the repression of translation of target mrnas encoding proteins that mediate cell cycle arrest and differentiation e.g. p21waf1/cip <dig>  numb and others  <cit> . musashi target mrnas are de-repressed and translated in response to environmental signals that require cell cycle arrest, indicating that a mechanism exists to reverse the inhibitory action of musashi  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which musashi-mediated translational control function is regulated to effect a context-specific response in mammalian neural stem cells has not been determined  <cit> .

characterization of the mechanism controlling cell fate transition in maturing oocytes of the frog, xenopus laevis, has suggested a candidate musashi regulatory strategy. in this model, progesterone-stimulated oocyte maturation, like differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells, requires the translation of musashi target mrnas  <cit> . musashi <dig> is present in immature oocytes but does not direct translational activation until after progesterone stimulation. the functional switch to activate translation of musashi <dig> target mrnas in progesterone-stimulated oocytes requires regulatory phosphorylation that is mediated through cyclin-dependent kinase and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases  signaling  <cit> . the sites of regulatory phosphorylation are conserved in the mammalian musashi <dig> protein   <cit> . based on these observations, we hypothesized that regulatory phosphorylation of musashi <dig> may be relevant to control of cell fate transitions in mammalian neural stem cells.

in this study, we report that regulatory serine  <dig> phosphorylation of mammalian musashi <dig> occurs concomitant with de-repression and translation of target mrnas. inhibition of this regulatory musashi phosphorylation attenuates the initiation of differentiation of nspcs and of transformed sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells. we further demonstrate that musashi <dig> is regulated in response to cell death signals and that inhibition of musashi <dig> phosphorylation promotes aberrant survival of primary and transformed neural progenitor cells under conditions of nutrient deprivation. together, our findings indicate a critical requirement for site-specific phosphorylation in the regulation of musashi <dig> function during neuronal cell fate transitions.

RESULTS
we have recently demonstrated that regulatory phosphorylation of musashi <dig> is required to allow the target mrna translation that mediates cell cycle control during maturation of xenopus oocytes  <cit> . to determine if musashi <dig> is similarly regulated in neural stem and progenitor cells, we examined the phosphorylation state of the conserved serine  <dig>  in primary embryonic rat nspcs using a phospho-specific antiserum that recognizes mammalian s <dig>  <cit> . a basal level of musashi <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation was observed in control, proliferating neurosphere cultures that rapidly increased upon exposure to differentiation conditions . over three independent experiments, the normalized ratios of phosphorylated musashi <dig> were significantly increased ;  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively with a mean of  <dig>  . a similar increase in the level of musashi <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation was observed in transformed human sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells upon exposure to differentiation conditions . over three independent experiments, the normalized ratios of phosphorylated musashi <dig> were significantly increased ;  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively with a mean of  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

based on these findings, we hypothesized that the modest but significant increase in musashi <dig> regulatory phosphorylation may facilitate the de-repression of the musashi target mrnas that are required to mediate cell cycle control during neural differentiation. the p21waf1/cip <dig> mrna is a target of musashi <dig>  <cit>  that must be de-repressed to facilitate neural differentiation  <cit> . musashi <dig> phosphorylation was coincident with an increase in p21waf1/cip <dig> protein levels, consistent with de-repression and translation of the p21waf1/cip <dig> mrna . as p21waf1/cip <dig> protein levels are influenced by multiple regulatory mechanisms  <cit> , we utilized a musashi-specific reporter mrna to confirm that musasahi <dig> regulatory phosphorylation correlated with target mrna translation. the reporter mrna encoded the firefly luciferase gene under control of an mrna 3′ untranslated region containing a musashi-specific regulatory element   <cit> . translation of the reporter firefly luciferase mrna was repressed in proliferating sh-sy5y cells . over six independent experiments, the levels of firefly luciferase were significantly decreased ;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 82%, respectively with a mean of 77% . similar repression of this musashi target reporter mrna has been previously demonstrated in proliferating primary nspcs  <cit> . exposure of the sh-sh5y cells to differentiation conditions for 24 hours resulted in the de-repression of the musashi reporter mrna back to levels indistinguishable from the control reporter lacking an mbe ;  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively with a mean of  <dig> % . the de-repression of the musashi reporter mrna is consistent with the increase in p21waf1/cip <dig> protein levels seen during sh-sy5y differentiation . the reporter mrna was expressed at equivalent levels under each culture condition  and importantly, the level of musashi <dig> protein was not significantly decreased during early differentiation . while de-repression of target mrnas could be mediated through degradation of the repressing mrna-binding proteins, our findings indicate that the de-repression and translation of musashi target mrnas during initiation of differentiation can occur in the presence of musashi protein. musashi <dig> protein has been similarly shown to persist during the early phases of differentiation of p <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells  <cit> , again suggesting that musashi <dig> activity is regulated independently of protein degradation.figure  <dig>

we next wished to determine if regulation of musashi <dig> was required to mediate differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells. to address this issue, we sought to inhibit musashi <dig> regulation through expression of competitive, phospho-inhibitory mutant musashi <dig> protein . the mutant musashi s337a was fused to egfp for visualization and utilized to assess the role of regulatory phosphorylation in differentiation of nspcs and sh-sy5y cells. control, egfp-transfected nspcs exhibited a high level of neurite extension after culture in differentiation conditions, . initiation of differentiation was scored in transfected versus untransfected cells after 2 days of differentiation conditions, a time point when the cell density remained low enough to clearly distinguish morphological differentiation of isolated cells. under these conditions, the level of control cells exhibiting differentiation was similar to the level of non-transfected cells exhibiting differentiation in the same culture dish. expression of musashi <dig> s337a resulted in a dramatic reduction in number of cells exhibiting phenotypic differentiation. similarly, over-expression of the wild-type musashi <dig> also inhibited differentiation, although to a somewhat lesser extent . an inhibitory effect of expression of musashi <dig> s337a and wild-type musashi <dig> was also observed upon initiation of differentiation by sh-sy5y cells . taken together, our data indicate that attenuating the regulation of musashi function interferes with initiation of neural differentiation.figure  <dig>

during the course of the differentiation experiments, we noticed that expression of the mutant musashi <dig> s337a resulted in the survival of more transfected cells than seen with expression of either the wild-type musashi <dig> or the control egfp tag alone. to examine a possible stimulatory effect upon cell survival caused by inhibition of musashi <dig> phosphorylation, we exposed the transfected cells to nutrient deprivation in the absence of trophic factors . cell counting indicated that a similar number of musashi1- or musashi <dig> s337a-transfected cells were present, relative to control egfp-transfected cells, one day after transfection, prior to nutrient deprivation . however, upon examination of the cells following fourteen days of nutrient deprivation, that resulted in the death of the majority of transfected and un-transfected nspc cells, we observed that significantly more musashi <dig> s337a-transfected cells were present compared to the egfp control transfected cultures . similarly, after 4 days of nutrient deprivation of sh-sy5y cells, significantly more musashi <dig> s337a-transfected cells survived relative to egfp-transfected control cells . notably, expression of the wild-type musashi <dig> protein did not provide a statistically significant survival advantage under the same conditions for either cell type . these results suggest that inhibition of musashi <dig> regulatory phosphorylation specifically promotes cell survival under conditions of nutrient deprivation. consistent with a requirement for musashi <dig> regulatory phosphorylation in controlling the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, we observed that musashi <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation increased significantly under conditions of nutrient deprivation . over three independent experiments, the normalized ratios of phosphorylated musashi <dig> were significantly increased in serum starved over control cells ;  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively with a mean of  <dig>  . consistent with starvation-induced translation of the p21waf1/cip <dig> mrna  <cit> , p21waf1/cip <dig> protein levels also increased in sh-sy5y subject to nutrient deprivation .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we show that differentiation and nutrient deprivation modulate musashi <dig> function in primary rat nspc cells. regulatory phosphorylation of musashi <dig> on s <dig> is correlated with a switch in function from repression to activation of translation of target mrnas. we show that de-repression of musashi target mrnas occurs in the absence of overt loss of musashi <dig> protein, indicating that musashi function is regulated through protein modification rather than degradation, during the initiation of cell fate transitions. our findings support a model in which musashi regulation is required for both physiological and pathological neural progenitor cell differentiation and responses to nutrient deprivation. these studies contribute to a growing literature that describes a pivotal role for regulated control of mrna translation in mediating cell fate transitions  <cit> .

a requirement for musashi regulation during neural cell fate transitions is demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of wild type musashi <dig> or phospho-inhibitory musashi <dig> s337a mutant protein overexpression in nspcs and sh-sy5y cells . elevated musashi <dig> levels are associated with a proliferative predisposition and loss of differentiation potential in a wide variety of tissue and cell types  <cit> . conversely, studies utilizing musashi knockdown strategies have demonstrated that loss of musashi impedes cell growth and/or survival and promotes differentiation  <cit> . indeed, this is assumed to be the basis for translation of musashi target mrnas in mature tissues where musashi <dig> levels are very low. taken together, our findings support a model in which phosphorylation of musashi, like loss of musashi protein through knockdown, serves to de-repress and allow translation of target mrnas. our contribution here is to reveal a mechanism for control of musashi function in the absence of reduction in musashi <dig> protein levels. based upon our findings we propose that excess musashi <dig> protein inhibits differentiation by functioning as a competitive inhibitor of endogenous musashi regulation, presumably by saturating the capacity of upstream regulatory mechanisms. although our observations support a requirement for musashi <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation in mediating differentiation, we cannot exclude the possibility that overexpression of musashi <dig> s <dig> also acts to inhibit differentiation by titrating additional modifying events or essential co-factors  <cit> .

a specific role for musashi <dig> s <dig> regulatory phosphorylation was clearly indicated in mediating control of cell growth under conditions of nutrient deprivation as overexpression of the phospho-inhibitory mutant musashi <dig> s337a protein specifically promoted survival and growth of both nspcs and sh-sy5y cells . by contrast, over-expression of wild-type musashi <dig> did not modulate cell survival in nutrient deprived cells . it will be interesting to identify the molecular determinants that distinguish between the effects of wild-type and musashi <dig> s337a mutant protein in mediating cell survival. the observation that differentiation, but not responses to nutrient starvation, was inhibited by overexpression of the wild type musashi <dig> protein in our system, suggests that a weaker, or more easily competed cellular response drives differentiation compared to nutrient availability.

regulatory phosphorylation of musashi <dig> is necessary for translation of target mrnas in oocytes and for target mrna de-repression in a nih3t <dig> fibroblast reconstitution assay  <cit> . we have previously reported that deletion of the c-terminal region of musashi <dig> prevents activation of target mrna translation, with the remaining n-terminal domain acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of target mrna translation  <cit> . we concluded that the n-terminal domain, which contains the rna binding functionality, targets the protein to appropriate mrna substrates, whereas the c-terminal domain serves to overcome repression and direct translation of the mrnas, presumably through recruitment of necessary co-associated proteins. we propose that phosphorylation of s <dig> within the c-terminal domain of musashi <dig> may be required to form the active translational induction complex. it is thus anticipated that the non-phosphorylatable mutant musashi <dig> acts to enforce repression of target mrnas. consistent with enforcement of musashi <dig> target mrna repression promoting survival in our study, okano and colleagues have recently demonstrated that musashi <dig> promotes the survival of human glioma cells through up-regulation of both notch and pi <dig> kinase/akt signaling pathways. this protective effect appears to be mediated in part by repression of numb and pten   <cit> . in addition to p21waf1/cip <dig>  numb and pten, additional musashi target mrnas may contribute to regulation of cell differentiation and cell survival in neural stem and progenitor cell populations  <cit> .

to date, the signaling pathways that regulate musashi <dig> function in stem and progenitor cells have not been established. we note however, that the conserved regulatory phosphorylation sites in mammalian musashi <dig> lie within consensus proline-directed kinase target sequences and both cyclin-dependent kinase and map kinase signaling pathways have been directly linked to musashi <dig> regulation in oocytes  <cit> . the highly related musashi <dig> protein also contains the sites of regulatory phosphorylation  <cit> . since musashi <dig> and musashi <dig> can act in a redundant manner in neural stem and progenitor cells  <cit> , it is likely that musashi <dig> is subject to a similar phosphorylation-dependent regulation during neural differentiation. together, musashi <dig> and musashi <dig> have been implicated in the self-renewal of stem and progenitor cells from a number of tissue types  <cit> , and we propose that cell fate transitions of multiple stem cell populations may be dependent upon regulated phosphorylation for control of musashi function.

we observe a low level basal phosphorylation of musashi <dig> in proliferating nspcs and sh-sy5y cells . this observation may reflect one of two non-exclusive possibilities: musashi <dig> may exist in a dynamic equilibrium between regulated and unregulated function throughout the cell cycle to allow flexibility in the control of target mrna translation; and/or musashi <dig> may be subject to cell cycle phase-specific regulation which appears as a low level basal state in an asynchronous cell population. in either circumstance, the data suggest that even in proliferating cells, a proportion of the musashi <dig> protein is regulated and thus promoting translation, rather than repression of target mrnas. such a duality in translational control has been reported in proliferating k <dig> cells where the tgfβr <dig> mrna is repressed by musashi <dig> while the smad <dig> mrna is translationally activated by musashi <dig>  <cit> . taken together, our results indicate that the ability of musashi to exert repression of target mrna populations is inversely correlated with site-specific regulatory phosphorylation within the c-terminal domain of the protein. it will be interesting to determine if musashi mutations that prevent regulatory phosphorylation are associated with loss of cell cycle control in any clinical proliferative disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal that a rapid regulation of musashi <dig> function and de-repression and translation of musashi target mrnas is required for cell fate transition in response to environmental signals. our findings suggest that control of physiological and pathological neural stem and progenitor cell self-renewal may be affected by modulating the signaling pathways that control musashi regulation. further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate musashi function in stem and progenitor cell populations may lead to identification of targets for therapeutic intervention to attenuate pathological musashi function. conversely, manipulation of musashi function may also be employed to maintain musashi repressor function and promote self-renewal of stem and progenitor cell populations for regenerative medicine.
