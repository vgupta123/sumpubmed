BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative bacilli, which colonizes the stomach and causes 50% infection of the population worldwide. chronic infection with h.pylori is the main cause of various gastroduodenal diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer and is also a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. in general, the host elicits robust immune response to h.pylori infection. however, the infection is often persistent and lasts for very long time, suggesting that h.pylori may evade both innate and adaptive immune responses.

the mechanism of protection against h.pylori infection remains largely unknown, but there are growing evidences to support a pivotal role of cd4+ t helper cells  in the immune response against h.pyori infection
 <cit> . th cells are activated when the peptide antigens are presented by mhc ii molecules, which are expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells . once activated, th cells are divided rapidly and secrete cytokines to regulate the active immune response. when mhc ii mutant mice are challenged by h.pylori, greater colonization of h.pylori in mutant mice are formed than in wt mice, suggesting that the mutation in mhc ii on apc cells fails on the presentation of epitopes peptides. the level of anti h.pylori antibody in challenged wild-type mice is high but not detectable in mutant mice. moreover, oral immunization with h.pylori whole-cell lysates reduced infection in wild-type and mhc i -/- mice but not in mhc ii -/- mice
 <cit> . all these observations suggest that th cells may play an important role in protection of h.pylori infection.

antibiotic treatment is the most effective therapy for h.pylori infection. unfortunately, this strategy often results in many side-effects, such as poor patient compliance, production of antibiotic resistant strain and re-infection. recently, developing effective vaccines against h.pylori has attracted much attention. epitope-based vaccine design  represents an alternative way to improve native antigen which can not evoke optimal immune response to pathogen
 <cit> . the conserved epitopes identified by ebvd have been shown to not only elicit specific immune response but also increase potency and breadth of immune response. one of the key steps in ebvd approach is the identification of appropriate epitopes to obtain effective response.

lpp <dig> is an outer membrane lipoprotein of h.pylori and also sheds from surface to medium
 <cit> . lpp <dig> is one of major antigens recognized by rabbit antiserum against h.pylori <cit> . passive anti-lpp <dig> antibody transfusion decreases h.pylori infection in h. pylori infected mice
 <cit> . therefore, lpp <dig> is an excellent vaccine candidate antigen for h.pylori infection.

in this study, we hypothesized that modified candidate antigens of lpp <dig> may trigger more effective immune response induced by h.pylori infection. two identified peptides on lpp <dig> were able to stimulate cd4+ t cell proliferation and additive secretion of ifn-γ. these results provide us better understanding of cellular immunity against h.pylori infection and insights into the design of h.pylori vaccines.

methods
prediction and synthesis of lpp <dig> th cell epitopes
amino acid sequence of lpp <dig> for h.pylori strain nctc <dig> was acquired from ncbi protein database . for balb/c mice, mhc ii molecule includes i-ad and i-ed types. potential i-ad and i-ed restricted th cell epitopes of lpp <dig> were predicted by syfpeithi system
 <cit> . five highest-scored i-ad restricted and five highest-scored i-ed restricted putative epitopes were selected. after further analysis, eight epitopes were synthesized by chinese peptide ltd.co. . the peptides were supplied as lysophilized powder and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide  at a concentration of 4 mg/ml, sterilized with filter and stored in aliquots at −20°c. peptides were diluted with rmpi  <dig> incomplete culture medium  before experiments. recombinant lpp <dig>  was expressed in escherichia coli previously
 <cit> .

mice and immunization
female balb/c mice aged 6 ~ 8 weeks were purchased from experimental animal center of southern medical university and approval to conduct this study was granted by the ethics committee of southern medical university. for rlpp <dig> immunization, mice were administered with 100 ug of rlpp <dig> emulsified in complete freund’s adjuvant  by subcutaneous route in the four limbs and boosted 2 weeks later with the same protein in incomplete freund’s adjuvant . for peptides immunization, mice were administered with 100ug of peptide in ifa using the same procedure. mice were used for experiments at 7–10 days after immunization. mice immunized with pbs were used as control. five mice were included in each group.

preparation of antigen presenting cell 
mice were sacrificed and spleens were harvested. after treatment with erythrocyte lysing buffer , splenocytes were resuspended to 5 × 107 cells /ml in pbs with the addition of 100 μl mitomycin-c . then these cells were incubated for 20 min at 37°c followed by three washes with rpmi  <dig>  the supernatant was discarded and the pelleted cells were resuspended in rpmi  <dig> as apcs.

cd4+ t cells proliferation assay
mice were euthanized and spleens were harvested after the last immunization. single-cell suspensions were obtained by homogenizing spleens and passing cells through a 70 mm cell strainer. the erythrocytes were removed by ammonium chloride lysing reagent . cd4+t cells were negatively sorted using mouse cd <dig> negative isolation kit . routinely, the resultant cells were >95% cd4+ t cell as determined by flow cytometry. to stimulate cd4+ t cells, peptides or rlpp <dig> were added into the mixture of apcs  and cd4+ t cells  which were resuspended in 200 μl rpmi- <dig> complete cultured . culture without any antigen was served as negative control. other controls were apcs without cd4+ t cells in the presence of cona and cd4+ t cells without apc in the presence of peptides. culture was set up in triplicate and incubated at 37°c, 5% co <dig> for 5 days. during the final 16–18 h, each well was pulsed with 1 μci of 3h] thymidine . 3h] thymidine incorporation was measured in a liquid scintillation counter after collecting cells onto glass fiber filters. the stimulation index  was determined by comparing 3h] thymidine incorporation in the peptide-stimulated wells with unstimulated wells using the following equation: si = mean cpm of peptide wells/mean cpm of no peptide wells. experiments were independently repeated three times. proliferative response was considered positive when si was ≥ <dig> at the 95% confidence level
 <cit> . to investigate if there was any additive or subtractive interaction among the identified epitopes, the peptides were pooled to stimulate cd4+ t cells from mice immunized with rlpp <dig> 

mhc restriction studies
to detect mhc restriction for presentation, mabs  against the murine i-ad , i-ed , and mhc class i   molecules were added to cultures and their capacity to inhibit peptide-specific proliferation were measured. briefly, purified cd4+ t cells from mice primed with rlpp <dig> were preincubated with mabs for 2 h at 37°c and then peptides were added and incubated at 37°c, 5% co <dig> for 5 days. the proliferation induced by peptides was tested as described above. culture incubated with peptides without mab served as negative control.

cytokine profile analysis by elisa and real-time pcr
to detect the subset of cd4+ t cells, cytokine profile in response to peptide l <dig> and l <dig> was analyzed. cd4+ t cell culture supernatant  was collected after 72 h and cytokines were quantified by ifn-γ and il- <dig> elisa kits . cytokine production was calculated from the titration of supplied calibrated cytokines standards. results were corrected for dilution of the sample to yield concentration in pg/ml. meanwhile, mrna expression level of ifn-γ and il- <dig> were quantified. total rna from splenic lymphocytes was isolated using trizol rna isolation kit . real time pcr was performed for ifn-γ, il- <dig> and β-actin  using sybr green supermix in a 96-well plate of the abi prism  <dig> fast sequence detector . 25 μl reaction mixtures contained 1 μl  <dig> x diluted cdna,  <dig>  μl 2x power sybr master mix  and 150 nm of each primer. the primer sequences were listed as below:

ifn-γ: 5′-tgtcatcctgctcttctttctc-3′

5′-gacctcaaacttggcaatactc-3′

il-4: 5′-aactcaagtggcatagatgtgg-3′

5′-gacctcaaacttggcaatactc-3′

β-actin: 5′-atccgtaaagacctctatgccaaca-3′

5′-gtcgccttcaccgttccagttt-3′

the relative fold change of mrna level of ifn-γ and il- <dig> was calculated using the delta delta ct  method
 <cit> . the averages and standard deviations were determined from triplicate datasets. Δct is the difference between ct of target mrna and ct of β-actin for each group.

flow cytometry analysis
splenic lymphocytes stimulated with l <dig> and l <dig> respectively were phenotyped by double staining with anti-cd <dig> and cd <dig> mabs  and fluorescence activated cell sorter. one million cells were collected and preincubated with rat igg2b anti-mouse cd16/cd <dig>  for 10 min to exclude unspecific fc-receptor-mediated binding. after washing in cold pbs , the cells were stained with pe-labeled anti-cd <dig>  and fitc-labeled anti-cd <dig>  mabs for 30 min on ice. unspecific staining was controlled with appropriate fitc and pe labeled isotype controls respectively. the samples were analyzed with facs calibur flow cytometer and the data were analyzed by cellquest software .

statistical analysis
data were representative of three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± standard deviation . the results were processed using student’s t-test with spss <dig>  program. significance was defined by a value of p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
eight th cell epitopes on lpp <dig> were synthesized
to study th epitopes on lpp <dig>  the potential binding motifs for i-ad and i-ed in amino acid sequence of lpp <dig> were predicted respectively. five i-ad restricted and five i-ed restricted epitopes were obtained . since there was only one amino acid different between residues 8 ~ 22aa and 7 ~ 21aa, the former was selected as candidate peptide because of its higher score. residues 58 ~ 72aa was both i⇀ad and i⇀ed restricted epitope. thus eight peptides were synthesized and named as l1 ~ l <dig>  the purities of these peptides were all >90% except for l <dig> which was too hydrophobic to be measured .

l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes stimulated cd4+ t cell proliferation
to identify th cell epitopes on lpp <dig>  cd4+ t cells from mice immunized with rlpp <dig> were isolated and cultured with apcs and synthetic peptides. cd4+ t cells, which were isolated from rlpp20-immunized mice but not from pbs-treated mice, responded to l <dig>  l <dig> and rlpp <dig> . cd4+ t cells without apcs could not proliferate . thus, proliferative cd4+ t cell response was antigen-specific since the cells were primed by rlpp <dig> but not by pbs. furthermore, cd4+ t cells recognize antigenic epitopes presented by apcs. these results indicate that l <dig> and l <dig> contain th cell epitopes of lpp <dig> 

cd4+ t cells recognized l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes in the context of mhc class ii molecule
cd4+ t cells recognize peptides presented by mhc ii molecules on apcs. the interaction between cd4+ t cells and the peptide-mhc ii complex can be blocked by mabs against mhc ii molecules. to determine the specificity of restriction of l <dig> and l <dig>  anti-mhc mabs namely i-ad and i-ed were incubated with apcs respectively prior to antibody stimulation of th cells. pretreatment of i-ad specific mab reduced cell proliferation significantly after l <dig> and l <dig> peptides’ stimulation. meanwhile, i-ed specific mab only inhibited th cells proliferation after l <dig> peptide stimulation but not l <dig> peptide. these results suggested that cd4+ t cells recognized l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes in the context of mhc ii molecules and confirmed that l <dig> belonged to i- ad restriction and l <dig> belonged to both i-ad and i-ed restriction. on contrast, anti-mhc i mabs had no effect on l <dig> and l <dig> stimulated th cells proliferation .

l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes both mainly secreted th <dig> cytokines
to determine the subset of cd4+ t cells induced by l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes, cytokine profiles of cd4+ t cells in response to l <dig> and l <dig> were analyzed by elisa. cd4+ t cells isolated from mice immunized with rlpp <dig> secreted two folds more th <dig> specific cytokine  after stimulation with l <dig> and l <dig> peptides compared with the control. moreover, the level of the secreted th <dig> specific cytokine il- <dig> remained unchanged in the medium after l <dig> and l <dig> stimulation, suggesting th <dig> was activated .this observation was further confirmed in the splenic lymphocytes from l <dig> and l <dig> immunized mice. the mrna level of ifn-γ was  <dig>  fold change higher in the splenic lymphocytes stimulation than controls while the mrna level of il- <dig> remained unchanged upon l <dig> and l <dig> activation . therefore these results demonstrated that l <dig> and l <dig> preferentially elicited a polarized th1-type response.

the identified two peptides interacted additively
to investigate if there was any additive or subtractive interaction between l <dig> and l <dig> epitopes, we pooled the two peptides to stimulate cd4+ t cells and compared the responses to the pooled peptides versus individual peptide. the pooled peptides stimulated significantly more elevated t cell response than each peptide . thus there is an additive interaction between the two peptides.

cd4+ t cell from mice immunized with identified two epitopes exhibited proliferation
having identified two th cell epitopes on lpp <dig>  we then evaluated whether lymphocytes primed by l <dig> and l <dig> could recognize naturally processed antigen. for this purpose, we immunized mice with two peptides emulsified in ifa respectively and assessed the response of cd4+ t cells in vitro. t cells from mice immunized with l <dig> or l <dig> exhibited significant proliferation upon stimulation with l <dig>  l <dig> and rlpp <dig> respectively in vitro . under the same conditions, t cells from ifa without peptides-immunized mice did not respond to any peptide and rlpp <dig> . this result suggested that th <dig> cells induced by either l <dig> or l <dig> had responded to native antigen rlpp <dig>  the facs analyses were also performed to determine the relative percentage of cd4+ cd3+ t cells immunized with l <dig> and l <dig> respectively. the percentage of cd4+ cd3+ t cells from mice immunized with l <dig> and l <dig> were higher than control . these results confirmed again that l <dig> and l <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells proliferation.

discussion
cd4+ t cells recognize antigenic epitopes in the context of mhc ii molecules on apcs. many investigations of h.pylori infection have demonstrated that the protective immune response is mediated by cd4+ t cells but not by cd8+ t cells. therapeutic immunization reduced h.pylori colonization in stomach in mice lacking b cells, suggesting that t cell is protective
 <cit> . oral immunization with h. pylori whole-cell lysates reduced infection in wild-type and mhc i -/- mice, but it had no effect on mhc ii -/- mice. anti-h.pylori antibody levels in serum showed a dominant igg in immunized wild-type and mhc i -/- mice but no detectable igg in mhcii-/- mice
 <cit> . cd4+t cells from h.pylori antigen immunized mice were sufficient to transfer protective immunity to the immunodeficient recipients
 <cit> . taken together, identification and characterization of the th cell eptioptes of lpp <dig> would contribute to a better understanding of protective immunity to h.pylori and facilitate the development of effective immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic strategies.

the identification of cd4+ t epitiopes has traditionally been done either by sequencing of eluted peptides bound to specific mhc ii molecules from apcs or by screening panels of overlapping peptides. these two methods were successfully performed to identify many t epitopes; however, the method of sequencing eluted peptide is potentially cumbersome to identify epitopes from multiple processed antigens but not specifically a single antigen. the overlapping peptide method needs synthesis of a series of overlapping peptides, thus making it an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process. in addition, this method possibly misses junctional epitopes that might be present in the overlapping regions, though spanning the entire length of the antigens
 <cit> . these considerations lead us to use the combination of prediction and experiments to identify th cell epitopes. although it is possible to miss potential epitopes, this method represents a quick and effective approach to identify epitopes. here we used algorithm program with t cell biological analysis to identify th cell epitopes on lpp <dig>  eight epitopes were selected to be synthesized and measured, of which two  were identified to be th cell epitopes, which were located at residues 83-97aa  and 58-72aa . interestingly, l <dig>  which was predicted to be both restricted by i-ad and i-ed, effectively stimulated more proliferation of splenic cd4+ t cells than l <dig>  which was predicted to be i-ad restriction. our results indicate that the combination of prediction and experiments is an easy and effective way to identify th cell epitopes. the present findings may be valuable for the development of epitope-based vaccines against h.pylori.

cd4+ t cells can polarize to th <dig> or th <dig> cells based on their profile of cytokine. th <dig> cells produce ifn-γ, il- <dig> and tnf-β that mediate cellular immunity. in contrast, th <dig> cells produce il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  which are responsible for humoral immunity
 <cit> . it is generally believed that polarized th1-type response is involved in the pathogenesis of h.pylori infection
 <cit> . but whether th <dig> or th <dig> type immune response is responsible for protective immunity is still unclear. some studies support that th <dig> response characterized by il- <dig> secretion is important to clear h.pylori <cit> . on the contrary, some studies reveal that protection against h.pylori is mediated by predominantly th1-type immune responses independent of il-4
 <cit> . moreover, some researchers demonstrate that a mixed th1-th <dig> phenotype is correlated with the protective immunity against h.pylori infection
 <cit> . therefore, identification of th <dig> and th <dig> type epitopes may help us investigate the role of th <dig> or th <dig> type responses on pathogenesis and immunity of h.pylori infection. meanwhile, it is also a pivotal step for a rational modulation of immune response by developing effective multiple th <dig> or/and th <dig> epitope vaccine. in this study, we found that l <dig> and l <dig> were both th1-type epitopes and induced cd4+ t cell to mainly secrete ifn-γ.

in conclusion, we have identified two th <dig> cell epitopes on lpp <dig>  peptide l <dig> is i-ad restricted epitope and peptide l <dig> is both i-ad and i-ed restricted epitopes. these two peptides both evoked th1-type response. in addition, the two pooled peptides stimulated significantly more elevated t cell responses, showing an additive effect. we have identified one b cell epitope of lpp <dig> using phage displayed library previously
 <cit> . next, we will combine these two th epitopes and one b cell epitope to evaluate whether the combined epitopes can induce protective response and prevent h.pylori infection better than the whole lpp <dig> protein in balb/c mice. the data from our mouse model will provide significant information for further study of epitope-based vaccine.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified two h-2d restricted cd4+ t cell epitopes of h.pylori lpp <dig>  which interacted additively and mainly secreted inf-γ and belonged to th <dig> type epitopes. immunization with the identified epitopes primed antigen-specific cd4+ cell response. these data provide useful insights regarding immunity against h.pylori and have the potential to guide the design of epitope-based vaccines.
