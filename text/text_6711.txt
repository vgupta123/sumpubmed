BACKGROUND
the union of sperm and egg pronuclei to form a new organism is the endpoint of a carefully choreographed process that includes gamete recognition, binding, and fusion of plasma membranes. our understanding of the molecular processes underlying these phenomena has been shaped by studies in sea urchins  <cit> , chlamydomonas  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , mice  <cit>  and, within the last decade, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . c. elegans is particularly suited to the discovery of molecules necessary for spermatogenesis or fertilization because its hermaphroditic mode of reproduction is unique among genetic model organisms. spermatogenesis defective  mutants discovered in genetic screens using hermaphrodites can be easily recovered by mating wild type males into the sterile hermaphrodites.

mutations in the c. elegans spe- <dig> gene result in the production of morphologically normal spermatozoa that are fertilization defective despite making direct contact with eggs in the spermatheca, the site of fertilization  <cit> . six other c. elegans genes that have the same mutant phenotype as spe- <dig> constitute the spe- <dig> class  <cit> , named for the first of these genes to be cloned  <cit> . the five cloned genes in this class have been shown, or are predicted, to be sperm plasma membrane proteins  <cit> . the phenotype of these mutants suggests that spe- <dig> and the other spe- <dig> class genes function at the moment that sperm and egg plasma membranes meet.

the consensus of  <dig> topology prediction algorithms  <cit>  suggests that spe- <dig> is a six-pass transmembrane protein with its n- and c-termini facing the cytosol . amino acid sequence analysis showed  <dig> domains of potential importance for spe- <dig> protein function:  a large extracellular domain between transmembrane helices  <dig> and  <dig> containing six conserved cysteines separated by 9- <dig> amino acids,  a dc-stamp domain  <cit>  that includes transmembrane helices  <dig> and  <dig> and  a predicted ring finger  <cit>  formed by  <dig> conserved cysteines in the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain. these  <dig> features are conserved in each of the  <dig> spe- <dig> homologs that are present in many metazoan genomes including drosophila, mice and humans . one of the two drosophila spe- <dig> homologs, sneaky, is necessary for the plasma membrane breakdown  event that occurs after a spermatozoon is engulfed by the egg during fertilization  <cit> . mutation of the second cysteine in the large extracellular domain disrupts pmbd, indicating its importance for sneaky function. because it is predicted to be extracellular, this domain could potentially interact with proteins on the egg surface. the presence of a dc-stamp domain, in both sneaky and spe- <dig>  suggests spe- <dig> may be involved in a membrane fusion event because the canonical dc-stamp protein is required for cell fusion events in the mammalian monocyte cell lineage  <cit> . the mechanism through which dc-stamp mediates membrane fusion is not presently clear.

spe- <dig> homologs in all species examined to date possess a predicted ring finger motif near the c-terminus. ring fingers are structural domains, held together by the coordination of two zn++ ions by the side chains of nearby cysteine, histidine or aspartic acid side chains  <cit> . these motifs are most commonly found in e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligases  <cit>  where they facilitate ubiquitination of target proteins  <cit> . e <dig> ring finger proteins simultaneously interact with a substrate and a ubiquitin-conjugated e <dig> enzyme, allowing transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate by the e <dig>  unlike hect domain e <dig> s that covalently bind ubiquitin and transfer it to the substrate directly  <cit> , ring domain e <dig> s lack catalytic activity. although the spe- <dig> protein does not show significant sequence homology to e <dig> ligases outside the ring finger, this domain is the chief unifying feature in an otherwise diverse e <dig> ligase family. therefore, we cannot confirm or rule out an e <dig> ligase-like function for spe- <dig>  sequence analysis of spe- <dig> family members predicts that in all cases the zn++ ions are coordinated by eight cysteines , unlike most e <dig> ring fingers, which include a histidine in a c3hc <dig> arrangement  <cit> .

in the experiments described here, we used a systematic mutagenesis approach to characterize the cytoplasmic c-terminal region of spe- <dig> containing the putative ring finger. the ability of spe- <dig> transgenes bearing single amino acid substitutions or larger scale changes to produce progeny in an otherwise self-sterile spe- <dig> null mutant strain allowed us to determine the importance of individual amino acids for spe- <dig> function. our results showed that the  <dig> cysteine residues predicted to form a ring finger are critical for spe- <dig> function in vivo. we used these data along with previously solved ring finger structures to develop a structural model of the spe- <dig> ring domain including predictions of the specific amino acids that are most likely to participate in protein-protein interactions.

RESULTS
a structural model of the spe- <dig> ring finger
the ring finger at the c-terminus of spe- <dig> was predicted by primary amino acid sequence analysis and closely matches the consensus zn++ ligand spacing of the pfam ring finger consensus  and the cloned spe- <dig> homolog sneaky  <cit> . we developed a structural model of spe- <dig> using the structures of known ring finger containing proteins. the model is based on sequence conservation with the four most closely related ring finger sequences in the rscb protein data bank  http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do; c-cbl proto-oncogene ring domain   <cit> , tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor- <dig>  ring domain   <cit> , ccr4-not transcription complex, subunit  <dig>     <cit> , and cellulose synthase, catalytic subunit ,  . the criteria for selecting these four structures were overall sequence identity, number of contiguous homologous residues  and relative positioning/spacing of the zinc ligands. multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> ring domains resulted in  <dig> of  <dig> ligands to the two zinc centers aligning across all sequences represented . based on the known structures, we observed topological flexibility about ligands  <dig> and  <dig> leading to the misalignment of the last zinc ligand. nonetheless, the overall ring finger domain fold was maintained . additional file 1: panel b shows the homology model of spe- <dig> based on the four ring finger structures. importantly, polar and charged residues were found in more solvent exposed positions while non-polar residues were less solvent exposed in our homology model.

because ring finger domains are typically protein-protein interaction sites, we identified the potential protein-protein interaction surface and residues on the spe- <dig> model. the template structure 3hct contains both the traf- <dig> ring finger domain and its interaction partner ubc <dig>  providing a means to assess critical points of contact between them. figure  <dig> shows the structural alignment of spe- <dig> and traf- <dig> ring finger domains with respect to traf- <dig> binding partner ubc <dig>  all residues in spe- <dig> within 5Å of ubc <dig> resulting from the alignment are shown. figure  <dig> shows the ring finger sequence with these residues colored blue. the sequential location of identified residues with respect to the zn++ ligands is consistent with well-characterized e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating-e <dig> ubiquitin ligase interaction sites  <cit> .

an additional outcome of the spe-42/ring finger protein alignment and homology model generation was the exclusion of the first cysteine, c <dig>  in this short sequence domain from participating in metal binding. further, the proximity of cysteine  <dig> to cysteine  <dig>  both in sequence space and in the spe- <dig> model, led to the prediction that mutation of cysteine  <dig> would show an intermediate, non-null, phenotype. this would be expected if cysteine  <dig> is able to rearrange and weakly associate with the zn++ in place of cysteine  <dig>  an extension of this prediction is that if both cysteine  <dig> and cysteine  <dig> are mutated simultaneously the phenotype will follow that shown by the other cysteine residues in which zn++ binding is irreconcilably disrupted.

contribution of ring finger cysteines to spe- <dig> protein function
transgenic constructs coding for cysteine-to-alanine substitutions at each predicted ring finger cysteine  were created. individual transgenes were crossed into a spe- <dig> or a spe- <dig> genetic background and protein function was measured by counting live progeny. worms homozygous for either of these spe- <dig> mutations are completely sterile at the 25°c assay temperature , so any progeny produced result from transgenic rescue. the results of the crosses are reported in table  <dig>  spe- <dig> protein function was severely reduced for all cysteine to alanine mutations except for cysteine  <dig>  surprisingly, average broods for the cysteine  <dig> mutation were 45% of broods from lines with a wild type transgene, suggesting that either this amino acid is not essential for zn++ coordination or some other amino acid was partially compensating for its loss. as predicted by our spe- <dig> homology model above, a good candidate for the compensating amino acid was cysteine  <dig> 

live progeny were counted for three independently-derived transgenes for each amino acid substitution. all transgenes are in a spe- <dig> null genetic background. n <dig> and spe- <dig> worms listed at the bottom do not carry transgenes. all counts were conducted until the first day each worm produce no live progeny. counts shown are ±sem and were rounded to the nearest whole number with the exception of sem values less than one. spe- <dig> data are from  <cit> .

to test this model, two additional transgenes were made: one in which cysteine  <dig> was substituted with alanine and a second in which both cysteines  <dig> and  <dig> were substituted . as predicted by the model, transgenes with the cysteine  <dig> mutation rescued at the same level as wild type transgenes, indicating that this mutation alone does not affect protein function. the cysteine 678/ <dig> double mutant reduced brood counts to the same low level observed for the other  <dig> cysteine mutant transgenes described above. these results clearly demonstrate that, while cysteine  <dig> is not required for zn++ coordination under normal circumstances, it can partially compensate for the loss of cysteine  <dig>  restoring protein function to a level sufficient for fertilization to take place. taken together, our results make a strong case that the  <dig> red cysteines shown in figure  <dig> are actually involved in the zn++ coordination that holds together the spe- <dig> ring finger structure and that our spe- <dig> homology model, generated from known ring finger structures, is robust and predictive.

counts were conducted as described for table  <dig> 

incompatibility of the c. elegans and c. briggsae spe- <dig> proteins is not caused by the specific amino acid sequence c-terminal to the ring finger
c. briggsae is in the closest sister taxon to c. elegans, the two species having diverged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . although c. elegans and c. briggsae are difficult to distinguish by phenotype, they are reproductively isolated. pair-wise comparison of c. elegans spe- <dig> with its c. briggsae homolog revealed that the two proteins are 85% identical and  <dig> % similar except for the c-terminal  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, where they are only 25% identical and  <dig> % similar . the divergent sequence is encoded by the last exon of each gene. the two most likely explanations for this divergence are first, that this part of the protein is not important for function and therefore is under very little evolutionary constraint or second, that the sequence changes define a key difference between the two proteins that may explain the observed reproductive isolation. a transgene containing a genomic dna clone of the c. briggsae spe- <dig> homolog under the control of the c. elegans spe- <dig> promoter and 3' utr  failed to produce more than a few progeny in spe- <dig> null mutant worms, suggesting that some aspect of the c. briggsae protein is incompatible with the c. elegans fertilization machinery . two chimeric constructs in which the last exon of c. elegans spe- <dig> was swapped into the c. briggsae gene and vice versa were created to ask whether adding the c. elegans exon to the c. briggsae gene would improve transgenic rescue and adding the c. briggsae exon to the c. elegans gene would decrease progeny compared to a wild type c. elegans spe- <dig> transgene . the results of these crosses show that replacing the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids in the c. briggsae protein with the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids in the c. elegans protein increased average progeny counts by only a few worms, while the reciprocal swap of c. briggsae amino acids into the c. elegans protein did not change progeny counts at all . these results demonstrate that the incompatibility between the c. elegans and c. briggsae homologs therefore lies in one or more of the individual sequence changes scattered throughout the rest of the protein. these differences define a starting point for continuing our structure-function investigation of spe- <dig> outside of the ring finger domain.

transgenic rescue was quantified for three independently-derived transgenes for each construct. exon shading scheme is the same as in fig. 4b. constructs were fused to the c. elegans promoter and 3' utr at the start and stop codons. all transgenes are in a spe- <dig> null genetic background. n <dig> and spe- <dig> worms listed at the bottom do not carry transgenes. all counts were conducted until the first day each worm produced no live progeny. counts are ± sem rounded to the nearest whole number except for values less than one. the spe- <dig> data are from  <cit> .

potential function of the ring domain
ring fingers are multi-functional protein-protein interaction domains normally associated with e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity. although examples of ring fingers in proteins that are not e <dig> s may exist, functional data support an e <dig> ligase activity for almost half of the  <dig> predicted human ring finger proteins  <cit> ; the rest either have not been examined or no alternative molecular mechanism of action has been assigned. some ring finger proteins like bard <dig> do not possess intrinsic e <dig> ligase activity but are instead part of a multi-protein complex that does, in this case the brca1-bard <dig> heterodimer  <cit> . other ring fingers like traf <dig> must form homodimers in order to interact with e <dig> ligases  <cit> .

the spe- <dig> ring finger could potentially function in multiple ways during c. elegans fertilization. regardless of whether spe- <dig> is itself an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, is part of an e <dig> complex with other proteins, or does not have e <dig> activity at all, the ring finger-like domain likely mediates protein-protein interactions. spe- <dig> interaction with its binding partner could serve as a checkpoint for sperm competence to fuse with the egg, as a signal to the egg that the sperm nucleus and other contents have been delivered, or even as a signal that fusion has occurred and membrane proteins important for fertilization should be degraded to prevent polyspermy. recent evidence from chlamydomonas showed that fus <dig> and hap <dig>  proteins essential for gamete fusion, are rapidly degraded immediately following membrane fusion  <cit> . these researchers further demonstrated that it was the membrane fusion event and not merely gamete binding prior to fusion that initiated protein degradation. the spe- <dig> ring finger could act while still tethered to the plasma membrane or it could be cleaved from the rest of the protein, releasing it into the cytoplasm to act elsewhere. the mouse ring finger protein  <dig>  is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that is normally an integral endosomal membrane protein. rnf <dig> can be proteolytically cleaved, however, releasing the ring domain into the cytoplasm  <cit> . spe- <dig> also has a dc-stamp domain that may be involved in membrane fusion events and a large extracellular domain that could interact with egg surface proteins. spe- <dig> therefore has potential to interact with egg surface proteins, help to mediate sperm-egg fusion and signal that fusion has occurred.

use of spe- <dig> expressed from extrachromosomal transgenic arrays to analyze protein function
extrachromosomal arrays composed entirely of simple repeats of the injected experimental and marker dna are selectively targeted for silencing in the male germline  <cit> . the presumably small amount of protein expressed from simple-repeat extrachromosomal arrays is not detectable by immunofluorescence or western blot using antibodies that can detect both wild type and mutant protein expressed from the endogenous gene locus  <cit> . nevertheless, this small amount of protein is sufficient to produce robust rescue of every cloned spe and fer mutant described in the literature .

hemagglutinin  epitope-tagged spe- <dig> expressed from a low-copy genomic insertion is not detectable by a commercial ha monoclonal antibody despite the fact that the transgene rescues the self-sterile spe- <dig> mutant phenotype . attempts by the same group to detect a spe-42::ha fusion expressed in cho tissue culture cells have also been unsuccessful. because the mutant spe- <dig> protein expressed in our assays is not detectable, the possibility that the loss of fertility observed with the mutant transgenes is due to protein degradation or mis-localization instead of a simple loss of protein function cannot be excluded. the complete rescue observed in the c678a mutant, partial rescue seen in the c681a mutant and almost complete lack of rescue seen in the c678a; c681a double mutant strongly suggest that c <dig> can at least partially compensate for loss of c <dig> but that c <dig> is actually involved in zn++ coordination in wild type spe- <dig>  our results conclusively demonstrate that enough functional protein is reaching the site of action to provide ~46% of wild type activity levels in the c681a mutant, suggesting that significant degradation is not occuring. it is therefore plausible that spe- <dig> protein expressed from our mutant transgenes is correctly localized and simply lacks function.

CONCLUSIONS
we built a structural model of the spe- <dig> ring finger domain based on solved structures of other ring domain proteins. our experimental results demonstrate that  <dig> cysteine residues predicted to form a ring finger in the c-terminal domain of spe- <dig> by the model are critical for protein function during fertilization. we also showed that incompatibility of the c. elegans and c. briggsae spe- <dig> homologs does not result from evolutionary divergence in amino acid sequence at the c-terminus of the proteins. our data provide a starting point for further investigation of spe- <dig> function during c. elegans fertilization and elucidation of the potential roles of spe- <dig> homologs in other species.
