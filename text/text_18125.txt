BACKGROUND
many studies have demonstrated that aromatic ring dihydroxylation plays a primary role in the initial step of aerobic bacterial degradation pathways for various natural and synthetic aromatic compounds, including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and crude oil components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic compounds  <cit> . such ring dihydroxylation is catalyzed by multicomponent oxygenase systems known as rieske nonheme iron oxygenase systems . a member of ros, called as aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase, catalyze the incorporation of both oxygen atoms of molecular dioxygen as two hydroxyl groups to tandemly linked carbon atoms of an aromatic ring in a cis-configuration. the introduction of both oxygen atoms into aromatic substrates is a key reaction to initiate the transformation of relatively unreactive aromatic compounds, and novel oxygen activation and the addition mechanism of ros is a subject of great interest. despite substantial progress in understanding the structure, regulation, and kinetics of ros in recent studies  <cit> , no consensus exists on the chemical steps in the catalytic cycle. further knowledge of the mechanism can lead us to improved application of this important class of enzymes for not only the bioremediation of various environmentally relevant aromatic compounds, but also the synthesis of the chiral precursor compounds  <cit> .

the multicomponent systems of ros typically comprise the terminal oxygenase component and the electron transport chain, which consists of either one or two separate proteins: reductase alone or ferredoxin and reductase in combination  <cit> . biochemical and/or structural properties of several terminal oxygenase components of ro  have demonstrated that ro-os have a mononuclear iron site and a rieske-type  cluster  in common  <cit> . the mononuclear iron site activates dioxygen for reaction with the substrate, and the rieske cluster transfers electrons to the mononuclear iron site during the catalytic cycle. the structures of ro-os reveal that each α-subunit contains a mononuclear iron site and a rieske cluster separated by a distance of approximately 45 Å. however, the functional pair appears to be constituted by the mononuclear iron and the rieske cluster in neighboring subunits located within ~12 Å distance. the nonheme iron site is coordinated by two histidine residues and one carboxylate residue called the 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad, which is a versatile platform of nonheme iron-containing oxygenases including ros  <cit> . in most ro-o structures, the carboxylate residue is coordinated to the iron in a bidentate manner  <cit> , although monodentate structures have also been reported  <cit> . additional water molecules are found to be coordinated to the nonheme iron, forming a five- or six-coordinate catalytic ferrous site, depending on the number of water molecules. the rieske cluster has two iron and two sulfides; one iron is coordinated by two histidine residues, and the other is coordinated by two cysteine residues. the nonheme iron site and the rieske cluster can be bridged by a conserved aspartate residue located at the subunit interface, which may be important for electron transfer  <cit>  and regulation  <cit>  during the catalytic cycle.

the metal site composition of ro-os generally suggests that three oxidation states can stably exist: both metal sites are oxidized, the rieske cluster is oxidized and mononuclear iron is reduced, and two metal sites are reduced. another potential oxidation state with a reduced rieske cluster and oxidized mononuclear iron is not stable because of the relative redox potentials of the metal sites. spectroscopic studies report that substrate binding and dioxygen activation occur at the mononuclear iron center for naphthalene  <dig> -dioxygenase  and benzoate  <dig> -dixoygenase   <cit> . wolf et al. demonstrated that the oxygenase component of bzdo  alone in the fully reduced state could activate dioxygen and generate the cis-dihydrodiol product in a single turnover reaction  <cit> . following the single turnover of bzdo-o, this protein was found to be in the fully oxidized state with most of the products retained in the active site, suggesting that the mononuclear iron and rieske cluster each provide one of two electrons required by the reaction stoichiometry. the same was found to be true for the oxygenase component of ndo , which produced an essentially stoichiometric yield of product in a single turnover based on the number of populated mononuclear irons present  <cit> . the binding of the dioxygen to the ferrous catalytic site was regulated by both substrate binding and rieske cluster reduction, implying that a structural change occurs in the vicinity of the ferrous iron site during the catalytic cycle. indeed, this was demonstrated from crystallography for an allosteric effect of the rieske cluster in 2-oxoquinoline 8-monooxygenase   <cit> . martins et al. showed that reduction of the rieske cluster modulated the ferrous nonheme iron through a chain of structural changes across the subunit interface, resulting in the movement of the nonheme iron and its ligand histidine away from a substrate-binding site  <cit> . the ferrous nonheme iron changes from five- to six-coordinate, which was also found for ndo  <cit> , bzdo  <cit> , and phthalate  <dig> -dioxygenase   <cit> . however, the crystal structures of the ferrous nonheme iron in ndo  <cit>  and carbazole   <dig> a-dioxygenase   <cit>  with a reduced rieske cluster are five-coordinate, which differs from omo-o. in addition, binding of the substrate to the active site of ro-os is a key step in regulating the reactivity toward dioxygen. until now, spectroscopic studies on ndo-o and the oxygenase component of pdo  found that the ndo-o  and pdo-o with the oxidized rieske cluster showed conversion of ferrous iron from six- to five-coordinate upon binding of the substrate to the active site  <cit> . however, the crystal structures of the nonheme iron site in the native and substrate-bound forms of ndo-o did not indicate a significant change in the coordination environment, maintaining five-coordinate structures  <cit> . the five-coordinate nonheme iron in the oxygenase component of omo  with the oxidized rieske cluster also did not show a change in coordination number even when a substrate was bound to the active site  <cit> . on the other hand, daughtry et al. have reported that five-coordinate geometry leaves one site open for oxygen binding and activation or the single solvent ligand could be displaced by oxygen binding, compared between the unliganded and the substrate binding structures of stachydrine demethylase  <cit> . as noted above, spectroscopy and current crystal structures have provided different perspectives of the catalytic mechanism involved in ros.

the observation that two electrons present in the rieske cluster and the mononuclear iron of ndo-o and bzdo-o are used during a single turnover supports the mechanism by which dioxygen is activated by reduction to the peroxo state after binding to the active site iron . following dioxygen activation, this state is considered to react directly with bound substrate or to result in o–o bond cleavage generating fe-oxo-hydroxo species prior to reaction  <cit> . an alternative mechanism involves an additional step in which one electron is donated to the initially formed fe-peroxo to produce the fe-peroxo intermediate, which could react either directly or as fe-oxo-hydroxo species after o–o bond cleavage. the latter mechanism is supported by studies that used pdo-o in which the mononuclear iron was left in fe state after yielding product  <cit> , while single turnover occurred as observed for ndo-o and bzdo-o. these studies suggest that an additional electron was transferred to the nonheme iron at some stage of the catalytic cycle from a rieske cluster in a neighboring α-subunit.

to understand the molecular basis of the catalytic cycle, karlsson et al. formed complex crystals of ndo-o with substrate, dioxygen, substrate plus dioxygen, or product and determined their structures by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . the complex structure with substrate and dioxygen showed that dioxygen was bound to the nonheme iron in a side-on fashion, which allowed each oxygen atom to attack the neighboring aromatic carbon atom from the same face of a planar aromatic ring, producing a cis-dihydrodiol. in addition, based on the fe–o bond lengths in the crystal structure, the complex is likely to be an fe-peroxo species. however, conformational changes by the binding of substrate and/or oxygen in the above-mentioned crystal structures were hardly observed. in these situations, determining whether conformational changes including coordination conversion at the active site occur by binding of substrate and/or oxygen is very important for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in ros.

we have investigated the enzymatic function of cardos, members of ros, from various bacteria: pseudomonas resinovorans ca <dig>  janthinobacterium sp. j <dig>  novosphingobium sp. ka <dig>  and nocardioides aromaticivorans ic <dig>  <cit> . all cardos commonly consist of three components: terminal oxygenase , ferredoxin , and ferredoxin reductase . we determined the structures of cardo-os of j <dig> and ic <dig>  <cit>  and cardo-fs of ca <dig> and ic <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the structures of the cardo-o: cardo-f binary complex were determined in non-reduced, reduced, and car-bound forms using cardo-o of j <dig> and cardo-f of ca <dig>  <cit> . these structures provide a structure-based interpretation of inter-component electron transfer between two rieske clusters of ferredoxin and oxygenase in ros as well as, conformational changes upon car binding, which result in the closure of a lid over the substrate-binding pocket  <cit> .

in the present study, we used cardo-o of j <dig> and cardo-f of ca <dig>  hereafter simply termed oxy and fd, respectively, and aimed to clarify the holistic catalytic mechanism including conformational changes in ros by determining various structures of the oxy:fd binary complex at different steps.

RESULTS
overview
although oxy:fd binary complexes in non-reduced, reduced, and non-reduced car-bound forms were called binary complex, complexred, and complexsubs, respectively, in a previous paper   <cit> , they were respectively renamed oxy: fdrest [ in figure  <dig>  oxy: fdred , and oxy: fdcar  in this paper, because the non-reduced complex can be considered to be in the resting state in the catalytic cycle and because the car-bound complex was obtained using resting state crystals soaked in a car-containing crystallization solution under aerobic conditions. uv-visible absorption spectra of the crystals of oxy: fdrest and oxy: fdred were previously measured by single-crystal microspectrophotometer  <cit> , suggesting that rieske clusters in oxy: fdrest and oxy: fdred were oxidized and reduced, respectively   <cit> . we did not measure the absorption spectra of crystals soaked with car-containing solution. but the redox state of the rieske cluster in oxy: fdcar was considered to be oxidized, because of the fact that oxy: fdcar was obtained by soaking with car-containing solution of resting state crystals at atmospheric condition. on the other hand, this spectroscopic analysis did not provide information on the redox state of the nonheme iron.

in the present study, we determined the crystal structures of the reduced car-bound oxy:fd complex , oxygen-bound oxy:fd complex , and both car- and oxygen-bound oxy:fd complex  at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively. to ensure redox state of the rieske cluster of the crystals, absorption spectra of oxygen-bound oxy:fd crystal was measured as described previously  <cit> . an absorption pattern similar to that of oxy: fdrest crystal was observed, suggesting that rieske clusters in oxygen-bound oxy:fd  crystals were re-oxidized by dioxygen binding/exposure . although we did not determined the absorption spectra of car-soaked oxy:fd crystals, the rieske clusters of oxy: fdred-car and oxy: fdcar-o <dig> crystals were presumed to be reduced and oxidized, respectively, because the methods for dithionite treatment and o <dig> exposure were similar to those in preparation of oxy: fdred and oxy: fdo <dig>  respectively. statuses around ferrous iron in the active site and the rieske cluster of the oxy: fdred-car, oxy: fdo <dig>  and oxy: fdcar-o <dig> are , , and , respectively, in figure  <dig>  crystal data and refinement statistics of the three determined oxy:fd structures in this paper are summarized in table  <dig>  all oxy:fd structures solved consist of one molecule of oxy  and three molecules of fd , and the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains one oxy:fd structure. three molecules of fd bind to the subunit boundary of one oxy molecule. the superposition of three fd molecules binding to one oxy molecule in each oxy:fd structures resulted in a root mean square deviation  of  <dig> - <dig>  Å  and no evident conformational differences. in addition, comparisons of fd structures among the three structures also revealed no clear conformational changes  with the exception of a clear movement of the side chain of fd phe <dig>  which was observed in the oxy: fdred crystal in response to reduction of crystal previously  <cit> . in contrast, some recognizable conformational changes were observed resulting from reduction/substrate-binding around the active site iron and in the substrate-binding pocket of oxy subunits of these oxy:fd structures. structural differences among the three subunits of one oxy molecule mainly occurred by car binding. the electron density maps of car were only found in chains b and c, because the symmetry-related structure partially filled the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket in chain a .

the reduced oxy:fd complex structure bound with car 
using oxy: fdrest crystals soaked in a crystallization solution containing sodium dithionite and car, we obtained the structure of reduced oxy:fd complex bound with car, oxy: fdred-car [ in figure  <dig>  oxy: fdred-car provided the same observations as those of oxy: fdcar , which were a clear density for a flat aromatic compound in the active site  and the car-binding-dependent movement of amino acid residues leu202–thr <dig> and asp229–val <dig> toward the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket in chains b and c   <cit> . a comparison of the structures between oxy: fdred-car  and oxy: fdrest /oxy: fdcar  revealed a shift of approximately  <dig>  Å in the phenyl group of fd phe <dig> opposite the rieske cluster. the slight movement of phe <dig> in oxy: fdred-car was common in oxy: fdred, in which the single-crystal microspectrophotometer clearly confirmed the reduced status of the rieske cluster  <cit> . this suggests that this slight movement of phe <dig> may be specific for reduction of the rieske cluster. the active site of oxy: fdred-car showed a six-coordinate, distorted octahedral geometry with two water ligands, while that of oxy: fdcar  could be described as a distorted tetragonal geometry with one water ligand . although one water ligand was located at almost the same position as the water ligands of the oxy: fdcar structure, the location of the other had moved toward asp <dig>  the ligand of the nonheme iron, and the observed average bond length between two water molecules was  <dig>  Å. the position of the two water ligands was similar to that in the reduced omo-o structure obtained by crystallization under anoxic conditions .

orientations of car were virtually identical between oxy: fdred-car and oxy: fdcar as shown in figure 3a, clearer density and lower temperature factors were observed under the reduced condition , suggesting that car is bound to the active site more stably when the rieske cluster is reduced. notably, the nonheme iron and its ligand residue, asp <dig>  moved away from car by approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively, in oxy: fdred-car . in addition, compared with oxy: fdred , the movements of the nonheme iron and asp <dig> upon car binding were approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively . small conformational changes were also observed in residues around asp <dig>  on the distorted helix α <dig>  forming the active site, with shifts between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å for the cα atoms . the histidine ligands adapted to the movement of the iron with rather small changes in their side chain conformation. in addition, the side chain of asn <dig> shifted toward asp <dig>  although the helix α <dig>  including asn <dig>  had slight movement . in chains b and c of oxy: fdred-car, the average bond lengths between mononuclear iron–asp333od <dig> and mononuclear iron–asp333od <dig> changed from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å and from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å, respectively, which made the coordination of the carboxylate residue to nonheme iron clearly bidentate . similar conformational changes were reported in nitrobenzene  <dig> -dioxygenase  bound with substrates  <cit> . in many iron enzymes that utilize dioxygen, the long helices containing some ligands were to some extent distorted  <cit> . because such distortion has been considered to provide a dioxygen accommodation pathway or increase conformational flexibility, it was also suggested for cardo that the distortion in the α <dig> helix may be involved in creating an accommodation route for the dioxygen molecule. in the reduced structure of omo-o without the substrate, it was also reported that reduction of the rieske cluster displaced the nonheme iron  <dig>  Å away from the substrate-binding site  <cit> . however, an electron nuclear double resonance  study on naphthalene-bound ndo-o with a reduced rieske cluster showed that the substrate was displaced  <dig>  Å away from the nonheme iron compared with that in an oxidized rieske cluster  <cit> . in the case of cardo-o, reduction upon substrate binding triggered displacement of the nonheme iron and residues including asp <dig> away from the substrate, which increased the accessible surface at the mononuclear iron, opened room for dioxygen binding, and allowed binding of an exogenous sixth water ligand. in other words, movement of the nonheme iron away from the substrate when the rieske cluster is reduced might act as a physical mechanism of gating oxygen reactivity. furthermore, the conformational changes observed upon car-binding and reduction experimentally demonstrate the hypothesis in the previous spectroscopic studies by wolfe et al.: dioxygen binding at the mononuclear iron site is controlled by substrate binding to the enzyme when the rieske cluster is reduced  <cit> .

the oxygen-bound complex structure 
to obtain the oxygen-bound complex structure, oxy: fdred crystals were transferred to a crystallization solution for oxygen exposure. as a result, clear electron density corresponding to two atoms, such as oxygen atoms, was observed in all three chains . as shown in figure  <dig>  rieske cluster of the oxy: fdo <dig> crystal was proven to be oxidized. the positions of these exogenous atoms were roughly similar to those of dioxygen bound to ndo-o  <cit> . although the chemical nature of these exogenous atoms was not clear, we tentatively added a dioxygen molecule to the electron density in the model by referring to ndo-o  <cit> . to determine the type of dioxygen species present in the crystals, we refined the dioxygen species with an unrestrained o–o distance. as a result, the o–o distance was refined to be approximately  <dig> - <dig>  Å. such a distance between oxygen atoms suggests that the dioxygen species was a peroxide species. thus, the o–o distance of the putative peroxide molecule was refined under the restraint of  <dig>  Å, and we determined the oxygen-bound complex structure [oxy: fdo <dig>   in figure  <dig> 

in the final model, the o–o distance in the putative peroxide molecule was refined to  <dig>  Å, and the average temperature factors of the oxygen atoms were refined to  <dig>  Å <dig>  and  <dig>  Å <dig> , which were similar to those of all residues  and the nonheme iron  in chains a to c. the o <dig> atom was liganded to the nonheme iron , whereas the o <dig> atom was remote from the nonheme iron  . in the binary complex structure of ndo-o with dioxygen, the distances of two oxygen atoms from the iron were comparable   <cit> . thus, the orientation of dioxygen bound to the nonheme iron between the active sites of cardo-o and ndo-o was significantly different, and the dioxygen molecule was found to bind with the oxy: fdo <dig> crystal in an end-on fashion . previously, the mononuclear iron species with end-on and side-on peroxides was proposed or identified in the catalytic cycles of the antitumor drug bleomycin and various enzymes  <cit> . roelfes et al. reported the characterization of the model complex of fe-peroxo species with resonance raman spectroscopy and suggested that the fe-peroxo complex  and fe-hydroperoxo complex  were interchangeable by treatment with an appropriate acid or base  <cit> . in the case of the oxy: fdo <dig> structure, because the ph of the crystallization solution was low , the iron-peroxo species in oxy: fdo <dig> was proposed to be fe-hydroperoxo. studies of ndo and bzdo using nitric oxide and dioxygen, however, have shown that reactivity at the active site is regulated by both the redox state of the rieske cluster and the presence of substrate. especially with dioxygen, no reaction occurs in the absence of an aromatic substrate if the rieske cluster is oxidized  <cit> . thus, it was expected that substrate binding regulates the manner of dioxygen binding in the cardo oxy component in either a side-on or end-on binding fashion . furthermore, despite dioxygen bound to the active site, the distances between nonheme iron and oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of asp <dig> in oxy: fdo <dig> were almost identical to those of oxy: fdred , and no changes were observed in the positions of the nonheme iron between the two structures.

the car- and oxygen-bound complex structure 
the structure obtained from air-treated oxy: fdred-car crystals during car-soaking seemed to bind with both car and dioxygen. as shown in additional file 1: figure s1c, the fo-fc map obtained during the course of crystallographic refinement of this structure showed a large residual density beside the nonheme iron, suggesting the existence of a dioxygen species. we refined the dioxygen species as described in the subsection “the oxygen-bound complex structure”, and the o–o distance was refined to approximately  <dig>  Å. therefore, the dioxygen species was likely a peroxide species.

in the final model, the distance between two atoms in the putative peroxide molecule was refined to  <dig>  Å [oxy: fdcar-o2;  in figure  <dig>  considering the fact that rieske clusters of oxy: fdo <dig> were experimentally proven to be oxidized, rieske clusters of oxy: fdcar-o <dig> crystals were proposed to be oxidized. based on fe–o bond lengths, the complex structure was likely to be fe-peroxo species that were found in ndo-o bound with both indole and oxygen and the bzdo-o peroxide shunt reaction  <cit> . moreover, the electron densities corresponding to dioxygen species above the nonheme iron in the fofc map differed in all chains of oxy: fdcar-o <dig>  in chains b and c, the locations of dioxygen species were similar to those of the dioxygen-bound ndo-o with indole   <cit> , which indicates that the average bond lengths between mononuclear iron–asp333od <dig> and –asp333od <dig> were both approximately  <dig>  Å and bound in a side-on fashion . the electron density of the dioxygen molecule at the active site of chain a was identical to that of oxy: fdo <dig>  . in addition, the electron density of car was not found in the active site of chain a . the average distances between peroxide o <dig> atom–car c9a atom and peroxide o <dig> atom–car c <dig> atom were both approximately  <dig>  Å. this binding manner agrees with the fact that cardo-o catalyzes the angular dioxygenation for car.

in chains b and c, the average temperature factors of the oxygen atoms were refined to  <dig>  Å <dig>  and  <dig>  Å <dig> , respectively, and the values were higher than those of all residues  and the nonheme iron . the bound car also had temperature factors comparable with those of the dioxygen species  in those chains. these results indicate that dioxygen species and car had high but not full occupancy. further assessment of oxy: fdcar-o <dig> was carried out using a simulated annealing omit map for each ligand atom. the omit map for each atom of the diatomic molecule resulted in a residual electron density at the position of the omitted atom . considering the fact that cardo showed scarce activity at the low ph employed in crystallization , oxy: fdcar-o <dig> in chains b and c might be close to the structure of a reactive complex .

comparison of the dioxygen species in two dioxygen-binding structures,  and  in figure  <dig>  indicated that the orientation of dioxygen bound to the nonheme iron was roughly similar but that the binding manner was not  . based on our data and the proposal by wolfe et al.  <cit> , we speculated that the above-mentioned difference in the dioxygen-binding manner was due to whether the substrate was bound to the active site. that is, substrate binding might ensure that reactive oxygen species are prompted to bind to the desirable position . in addition, from superimposition, car was found in almost the same position as that found in oxy: fdred-car  and oxy: fdcar  . the position of the dioxygen molecule was similar to that found in the indole- and oxygen-bound ndo-o  <cit> , suggesting that this position is a common place for binding of activated dioxygen species in ro-os . the distances between the nonheme iron and oxygen atoms  of asp <dig> in oxy: fdcar-o <dig> were similar to those in oxy: fdcar  and oxy: fdo <dig>  , and the nonheme iron moved to a position close to those in oxy: fdcar and oxy: fdo <dig> . the movement resulted in the fix of reactive oxygen species at a suitable place for binding in oxy: fdcar-o <dig>  thereby seemingly catching oxygen atoms with substrate strongly to minimize the risk of leakage and unexpected reaction. although further investigation would be needed to determine what fe-peroxo species is protonated, protons are probably delivered through a water molecule connected to glu <dig>  tyr <dig>  and arg <dig>  which formed the substrate-binding pocket, because these three amino acid residues are conserved perfectly in all reported cardo-os .

CONCLUSIONS
the series of oxy:fd complex structures represented sequential steps along with the single turnover reaction, although the structure bound with product has not been obtained until now. our findings in the three structures in this study have provided several important implications for conformational changes in the catalytic cycle of ros. in oxy: fdred-car, substrate binding under the reduced condition triggers a shift of both nonheme iron and its ligand residues, allowing dioxygen to bind to the active site. the oxy: fdcar-o <dig> structure showed dioxygen bound to the nonheme iron and it was likely to be an fe-peroxo species. structural comparison of oxy: fdo <dig> and oxy: fdcar-o <dig> demonstrated the possibility that regulation by the substrate ensures that reactive oxygen species bind to the desirable position in an appropriate side-on fashion.

the scheme of the catalytic mechanism in ros by integration of reported findings in various structural and kinetic studies, including ours, was proposed as follows: i) the reduced ferrous iron in the active site and the oxidized rieske cluster is the first state in the catalytic cycle . iii) dioxygen bound in a side-on fashion to the active site of nonheme iron is activated by reduction to the peroxo state  . this state may react directly with the bound substrate, or o–o bond cleavage may occur to generate fe-oxo-hydroxo species prior to the reaction. iv) after producing a cis-dihydrodiol, the product is released by reduction of the nonheme iron with the second electron from the redox partner as suggested by wolfe et al.  <cit> , and then the state returns to the starting state .

some previous reports have suggested that oxygen activation at ro-o nonheme iron sites occur through fe and fe states  <cit> . however, ferraro et al. proposed that no higher-order oxidation states need to be invoked for a concerted mechanism leading to cis-dihydroxylation reactions catalyzed by ros  <cit> . this hypothesis involves the formation of an fe-peroxo complex, which is supported by several reports  <cit> . thus, whether the o–o bond must break before reaction with aromatic substrates remains unclear. a recent mechanistic study of ndo using diagnostic probe molecules, however, suggested that their monooxygenation reaction is mediated by an fe-oxo-hydroxo intermediate  <cit> . alternatively, this high oxidation state would be difficult to achieve in a nonheme ligand environment  <cit> . further study is required to elucidate the nature and reactivity of the iron-dioxygen species in ros. the results presented in this paper provide an additional basis for further structural investigations of oxygen binding and activation in biological systems.

in addition, it is of great interest when and how the redox partner is associated and then disassociated to the oxygenase component in the catalytic cycle because few structure-based interpretations of the interactions among ro components have been reported. therefore, the determination of complex structures between oxygenase and redox partner by x-ray crystallography under redox-state-controlled conditions will be important.
