BACKGROUND
the chemosensory system is critical in guiding insect feeding, mating and oviposition behaviours  <cit> . hair-like chemosensory sensilla distributed over the surface of chemosensory tissues including antennae, palps, mouthparts and tarsi, are used to detect chemical signals from the external environment  <cit> . chemosensory receptors of olfactory receptors   <cit> , gustatory receptors   <cit>  and ionotropic receptors   <cit>  are localized on the dendrite of chemosensory neurons housed in these sensilla. these receptors play a central role in helping insects detect chemical signals and regulate their behaviours  <cit> , and are also important molecular targets for designing and developing new pest control strategies.

even though drosophila melanogaster is the main model insect for these genes , the availability of new genomic and transcriptomic sequences from other species is consistently extending both the phylogenetic coverage and the number of orthologs identified. the d. melanogaster genome hosts  <dig> or genes that encode  <dig> ors by alternative splicing  <cit> . interestingly, insect ors are highly diverse, share no sequence similarity and have an inverted membrane topology compared with mammalian or genes, suggesting that insect ors are not g-protein coupled receptors   <cit> . drosophila gr genes have been classified into “co2”  <cit> , “sugar”  <cit> , “gr43a-like”  <cit>  and “bitter” clades  <cit> . grs promote insect survival by detecting nutritious compounds and help avoid toxic ones  <cit> . like ors, these receptors share no sequence similarity with vertebrate grs and their topology is inverted compared to the classic gpcrs  <cit> . more recently, a variant sub-family of ionotropic glutamate receptors , the ionotropic receptor family, was identified as a new class of chemosensory receptors in drosophila
 <cit> . on the basis of their expression and sequence characteristics, drosophila irs were further distinguished into two sub-families: conserved “antennal irs” involved in olfaction and species-specific “divergent irs” that are expressed in other tissues including gustatory organs and may possibly be associated with gustation  <cit> .

for this work we focused on the cotton bollworm , an economically important species feeding on a wide range of host plants. h. armigera is one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species with larvae that feed on numerous important cultivated crops such as cotton, peanuts, soybeans and maize. in a previous study, forty-seven or genes were identified from h. armigera adult antennal transcriptomes but only one gr and  <dig> ir genes  <cit> . only  <dig> full-length open reading frames were identified in this study, limiting any functional characterizations of these receptors. this previous transcriptome sequencing was restricted to adult antennae and did not consider other chemosensory tissues. here, we conducted additional sequencing on other potential chemosensory tissues, including taste organs, not only in adults but also in larvae. such transcriptomic data greatly improved the description of chemosensory receptors in h. armigera and will also assist in defining gene models for future genome studies.

indeed, some chemosensory gene families have a low amino acid identity with their homologues and in our experience de-novo gene predictors have a limited capacity in annotating them. even though genome sequencing will eventually provide a framework for full ascertainment, an extensive manual effort is required to curate complex genes such as grs and irs. moreover, in this work we first used the expression profile and phylogenetic analysis to associate each gene with putative functions, and then characterized the functions of candidate pheromone receptors by the sf <dig> calcium imaging technique. in addition, we outlined a path forward for an integrated study of the insect chemosensory system that can proceed solely based on transcriptomic information.

RESULTS
analysis of h. armigeratranscriptome
we prepared  <dig> rna-seq libraries which after sequencing and quality control provided us with  <dig> , <dig> read pairs of up to 100 bp in length . our trinity rna-seq assembly produced  <dig>  contigs which included redundancy due to alternative transcription or high polymorphism and non-coding regions. after an initial protein prediction using a combination of a 5th order markov chain and the pfam database, we created a subset of  <dig>  contigs with coding potential and annotated them with controlled vocabulary terms using the uniprot database. these open reading frames are available via the ncbi bioproject prjna <dig> . the full dataset, annotations such as gene ontology, enzyme classification, and visualizations can be explored at http://annotation.insectacentral.org/liu <dig>  after extensive manual curation, we verified or reconstructed  <dig> chemosensory receptors.

in silicodifferential expression profile of candidate h. armigerachemosensory receptors
to provide global gene expression profiles in different sequenced libraries, we surveyed the differential expression of all these open reading frames identified in this study. the complete result dataset is available at the csiro data portal . as expected, all these genes  were detected in at least one library. most of these genes were expressed in male and/or female heads, where the antenna, proboscis and labial palp of crucial chemosensory organs, are located suggesting a functional role of these genes in olfaction or gustation. specially, some genes appeared to be expressed only in male and/or female heads. for example, in the gr family harmgr1; in the ir family harmir <dig>  41a, 75p. <dig> and 87a; and in the or family five of seven pheromone receptors including the newly identified pheromone receptor harmor <dig> were detected only in male heads. in summary, from  <dig> sequenced libraries we found the transcriptomic support of nearly all predicted chemosensory receptor genes.

the h. armigeracandidate olfactory receptors
we identified  <dig> candidate ors with  <dig> full-length sequences from h. armigera transcriptomes of larval antennae, mouthparts and fat bodies, male and female adult heads, male and female adult tarsi, and female abdomens. this included  <dig> previously identified ors  <cit> . we named the genes as per the conventions followed by liu et al.
 <cit> . integrating all public data, we found that the previously identified harmor <dig> was actually a gustatory receptor based on a sequence search versus ncbi’s non-redundant database and a phylogenetic analysis, and therefore renamed it harmgr <dig> . we did not detect the previously identified harmor <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in our transcriptome , so the previously published sequences were used for our phylogenetic analysis. these 60 h. armigera ors were used for a phylogenetic clustering with  <dig> bombyx mori ors,  <dig> danaus plexippus ors and  <dig> heliconius melpomene ors . in this analysis, sixteen d. plexippus ors, five h. melpomene ors , and six b. mori ors  formed two monophyletic sub-families. one group of ors formed by bmoror <dig>  3– <dig> and  <dig>  harmor <dig>   <dig>  13– <dig> and  <dig> and dpleor1a, 1b, 6a and 6b was clustered with the pheromone receptor  group. the novel candidate pheromone receptor harmor <dig> shared  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities to heliothis virescens or <dig> and harmor <dig>  respectively. further, a phylogenetic tree from noctuid prs and co-receptors  allowed us to classify prs into six main sub-families: the or <dig>  or <dig>  or <dig>  or <dig>  or <dig> and or <dig> clades . the novel harmor <dig> was very close to the or <dig> sub-family and the other six harmors were well clustered into each clade of noctuid prs.figure  <dig>

we used rt-pcr on adult and larval antennae to study the expression profiles of  <dig> newly identified h. armigera or genes . the results showed that or <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected only in larval antenna while the others were detected only in adult antenna, with the novel pheromone receptor harmor <dig>  specifically expressed in the male antenna .figure  <dig>

the h. armigeracandidate gustatory receptors
we identified nine candidate grs from the h. armigera transcriptomes with harmgr1- <dig> and harmgr <dig> as full-length orfs but the five others as partial sequences . we used a phylogenetic approach to name these genes. previously reported harmgr <dig> that was not found in our transcriptome was renamed as harmgr <dig> following our identified harmgrs in order to avoid a replicated name. a phylogenetic tree was built with 10 h. armigera grs,  <dig> b. mori grs and  <dig> d. plexippus grs . harmgr1- <dig> were orthologous to the silkworm “co2” receptors, which shared ~ <dig> to 90% identity to b. mori gr1- <dig>  respectively. harmgr4- <dig> and gr <dig> were members of the insect “sugar” receptor sub-family and shared ~ <dig> to 65% identity to b. mori “sugar” grs. harmgr <dig>  one member of the “gr43a-like” receptor sub-family, was orthologous to bmorgr <dig>  and dmelgr43a  receptors. none of the “bitter” receptors were found in our transcriptome sequences .figure  <dig>

expression profiles were investigated with rt-pcr on larval antenna, larval mouthpart, male and female adult head, as well as male and female adult tarsi tissues. all of the sugar, co <dig> and gr43a-like receptor genes were detected in the male and female adult heads, harmgr <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in male and female adult tarsi, and harmgr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed only in female adult tarsi. only harmgr <dig> was detected in larval antennae while none of grs were detected in larval mouthparts .

the h. armigeracandidate ionotropic receptors
we identified eight candidate iglur and  <dig> ir genes from h. armigera transcriptomes including  <dig> of the  <dig> previously reported irs  <cit> . h. armigera iglurs were de-novo named using the arabic numerals 1– <dig> and homologous harmirs were named based on the sequences of d. melanogaster and b. mori. one sequence did not present any similarities with reported irs but retained their characteristic features, and thus was named harmir <dig>  the amino acid sequences of eight candidate harmiglurs and  <dig> harmirs were aligned with d. melanogaster iglurs. in harmiglur family with the exception of harmiglur <dig> and  <dig>  a conserved amino acid profile in three key residues of ligand-binding domains was observed . the profile was not, however, conserved for the candidate harmirs, confirming their membership to the ir sub-family rather than the iglur one . further, we identified the full-length orfs of two candidate co-receptors: harmir8a and 25a. they shared 49% and 63% amino acid identities with d. melanogaster ir8a and 25a, respectively, and showed a higher amino acid identity of over 70% with the ir8a and 25a of other lepidopteran species . in addition, the full-length orfs of a lepidoptera-specific ir87a solely expressed in adult antennae  <cit>  and a candidate receptor ir76b involved in salt-taste coding in d. melanogaster
 <cit>  were also found in our data .figure  <dig>

the phylogenetic tree of harmiglurs and irs was constructed with other lepidopteran irs and d. melanogaster iglurs and irs . we annotated nine new candidate harmir genes, five of which  were well clustered into conserved antennal irs and the remaining ones  were classified into species-specific divergent irs. harmir7d. <dig>  7d. <dig> and 7d. <dig> formed a sister clade to the b. mori ir7d clade. a new divergent harmir <dig> was not classified into any lepidopteran ir clades, but was clustered into drosophila divergent irs. in addition, two large sub-families  and a potentially specific ir group  <cit>  in lepidopteran species were observed .figure  <dig>

rt-pcr expression profiles were built for a number of adult tissues as well as larval antennae and mouthparts. in the adult tissues, the results showed that all of these harmir genes were strongly expressed in antennae of both sexes except for harmir75p. <dig> and 75p. <dig> exhibiting only a low level of expression. the harmir87a gene appeared to be specifically expressed in adult antennae. additionally, there were as many as  <dig> harmirs expressed in proboscises or wings. most harmir genes were detected in larval antennae and mouthparts, with only some exhibiting no or low expression, like harmir <dig> , 7d. <dig>  41a, 60a, 75p. <dig> and 87a .figure  <dig>

functional studies of candidate h. armigerapheromone receptors in sf <dig> cells
we used sf <dig> cells coupled with the calcium imaging technique  <cit>  to assess the activity of harmor <dig> and  <dig> to the major sex pheromone component -11-hexadecenal  as well as one minor component -9-hexadecenal  . harmor <dig> showed a significant response to z11-16:ald but not z9-16:ald, as seen in previous studies using the xenopus system  <cit> . moreover, harmor <dig> showed an apparent dose–response to z11-16:ald with ec <dig> value of  <dig>  × 10-9 m. harmor <dig> did not show any responses to either z9-16:ald or z11-16:ald.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this work we built upon previous studies to investigate an array of tissues that play an important role in insect-plant interactions  <cit> : larval antennae, larval mouthparts, larval fat bodies, as well as female abdomens, adult tarsi and adult heads with antenna, proboscis and labial palp. our research interest primarily focused on three crucial repertoires of chemosensory receptor superfamilies  due to their significance as potential target genes for designing and developing new pest control strategies and addressing the insect host-plant interactions. after the extensive sequencing and assembly using trinity rna-seq, we manually curated every transcriptome so that the community now has accessed to a repertoire of  <dig> ors,  <dig> grs and  <dig> irs. we found that h. armigera has more irs than in any other lepidopteran species reported to date  <cit> . further, nine h. armigera grs were found in the transcriptomic data, although gustatory receptors have been reported to exhibit extremely low expression in gustatory organs  <cit> . we were also able to fully reconstruct the transcripts of the newly predicted h. armigera chemosensory receptors from sequenced libraries.

in addition to verifying our transcript reconstructions, an extensive sex-, tissue- and stage-specific expression profile using rt-pcr for the newly identified ors and grs, as well as all the irs allowed us to further characterize these genes. we found four larvae-specific harmors which may be involved in larvae-specific behaviours. it has been reported that bmoror <dig>  expressed in silkworm larvae, mediated larval responses to cis-jasmone that may be emitted from mulberry leaves as an attractant  <cit> . these larvae-specific harmors may be candidate targets for future larval control. phylogenetic analysis showed that our newly identified harmor <dig> was clustered into the pheromone receptor sub-family, and shared a high identity to other noctuid prs. thus we believe that it is possibly a new candidate of h. armigera pheromone receptors, leading to a total of seven pheromone receptors reported in a lepidopteran species for the first time.

further, we used the sf <dig> calcium technique to measure the binding of harmor <dig> and  <dig> to the h. armigera sex pheromone components . this system is likely to more closely resemble in vivo h. armigera olfactory receptor functions, since insect sf <dig> cells are derived from a lepidopteran species s. frugiperda, and express a native co-receptor  to assist harmors in ligand detection. we identified a strong response of harmor <dig> to z9-16:ald, as seen in another functional study  <cit> . the harmor <dig> receptor, however, did not elicit a response to either component tested, and needs to be investigated in a comprehensive future analysis. although our calcium imaging did not help identify the ligands for harmor <dig>  it did work very well in the analysis of harmor <dig> to z11-16:ald, suggesting that the assay could be applied in future analyses to seek potential ligands for other ors.

four novel divergent harmirs were detected in both larval and adult antennae, suggesting a different function to the drosophila divergent irs that are not expressed in the antennae of any stages  <cit> . our extensive expression profile showed that most harmirs were expressed in antennae , providing a more extensive repertoire of antennal irs compared to  <dig> of d. melanogaster  <cit> . some harmirs were detected in adult proboscis and larval mouthpart, indicating that these irs may also have a gustatory function as previously indicated in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and s. littoralis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sequenced crucial chemosensory tissues, and utilized an integrated approach to probe three chemosensory receptor repertoires in our transcriptome. we identified a total of  <dig> chemosensory receptor genes comprised of  <dig> ors,  <dig> grs and  <dig> irs . in particular, the novel harmor <dig>  the orthologous genes of which have been never found in any other lepidopteran species, was identified as a new potential pheromone receptor. we also carried out, for the first time, an extensive sex-, tissue- and stage- expression profile for all h. armigera irs that showed a widespread expression of harmirs in non-antennal tissues, implying that in this species irs have a more complex function. together, this study greatly complements the information of chemosensory receptors in h. armigera, and shows the utility of combining transcriptomic, phylogenetic and functional assays to elucidating the function and evolution of the insect chemosensory system.
