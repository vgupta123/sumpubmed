BACKGROUND
cyanopeptolins are nonribosomally produced peptides with highly variable composition. the general structure of the cyanopeptolin peptide family encompasses  <dig> amino acids, including the residue 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone , where the six c-terminal amino acids form a ring  <cit>  and the n-terminal amino acid frequently is n-modified. the n-terminal amino acid and all positions in the ring except position  <dig>  and position  <dig>  can be occupied by variable amino acids, giving rise to a large number of cyanopeptolin variants  <cit> .

the succession of the modules  <cit>  and specificity of a-domain binding pockets in nonribosomal peptide synthetases   <cit>  can give a good prediction of peptide composition and structure. nrpss do not always perform stringent substrate selection and incorporation  <cit> , thus, relaxed substrate specificity is common in nrps  <cit> . in addition to the common module domains including the adenylation -, condensation - and thiolation -domains, several tailoring domains have been found associated with cyanopeptolin synthetases. methyltransferases are present in three cyanopeptolin gene clusters from anabaena, microcystis and planktothrix . halogenases are found in apd and mcn, while the tailoring domains responsible for side chain modification of the n-terminal amino acid are unique for each strain  transferase in oci, absent in mcn).

so far, only cyanopeptolin gene clusters derived from the genera anabaena  <cit> , microcystis  <cit>  and planktothrix  <cit>  have been characterized. they share the same basic domain structure but possess unique tailoring genes and a-domain substrate binding pockets, indicating independent evolution of cyanopeptolin genes within each lineage. sequence identity is high  between microcystis  and planktothrix  cyanopeptolin gene clusters. the more thoroughly investigated microcystin gene clusters show higher sequence identity within a genus than between genera. the same is likely to be the case also for the cyanopeptolin genes.

sequence variation in microcystin synthetase clusters has been investigated within strains of the genera microcystis  <cit>  and planktothrix  <cit> . modifications and reorganizations due to several recombination events have been reported  <cit> , and together with differences in substrate specificity between equivalent a-domains  <cit>  are the reason for the different peptide variants.

planktothrix niva cya  <dig> , isolated from a norwegian lake, produces cyanopeptolin- <dig>  <cit>  for which the amino acids configurations are unknown. this peptide was found to be highly similar to oscillapeptin e produced by planktothrix nies  <dig> , isolated in japan  <cit> . both peptides have the same molecular mass, but slightly different polarities  <cit> . a different content of l-/d-amino acids in the peptides was suggested as a possible reason for the observed difference  <cit> . to investigate the genetic basis of the differences between the peptides, we have cloned and sequenced the nies  <dig> cyanopeptolin gene cluster and compared it to the previously characterized niva cya  <dig> gene cluster. this has allowed us to explore nrps evolution and genetic variations in closely related strains and to investigate to what extent selectional forces operate on these gene clusters.

RESULTS
niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> have similar but not identical peptide profiles
the major peptides in the two strains consist of ho3so-ch2-ch-co-htyr-thr-htyr-ahp-ile-phe-ile . however, spiking experiments  revealed a slight difference in polarity between cyanopeptolin- <dig> from niva cya  <dig>  <cit>  and oscillapeptin e from nies  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to niva cya  <dig> producing only cyanopeptolins, screening of nies  <dig> shows production of additional peptide from other peptide-classes .

several cyanopeptolin variants were also detected in both strains. lc-ms-ms data identified minute amounts of seven cyanopeptolins in niva cya  <dig>  with variation in the first, third, fifth and/or seventh positions compared to cyanopeptolin-1138/oscillapeptin e . an earlier study has shown that nies  <dig> produce oscillapeptin c, d and e, based on spectroscopic analyses including 2d nmr  <cit> . our lc-ms-ms analysis of nies  <dig> confirmed the production of oscillapeptin d and e, but also identified a cyanopeptolin with the mass  <dig>  which is found in niva cya  <dig> as well .

niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> produced similar – but not identical – cyanopeptolin variants. the identified niva cya  <dig> cyanopeptolins were mainly combinations of hty/ile/leu in positions aa <dig> and aa <dig> and ile/leu/val in positions aa <dig> and aa <dig>  other unidentified apolar amino acid-like residues were detected in position aa <dig>  in contrast, the only variations observed in the nies  <dig> peptides were hty, ile/leu and hcala in position aa <dig> .

the binding pocket residues of the niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> a-domains were identified by comparison to the grsa-phe a-domain . the oci-a <dig> binding pockets are different  between the two strains, and the divergent amino acids are shown in bold. the composition of cyanopeptolins produced by niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> and their molecular weights  are shown with amino acids correlated with the putative binding pockets. hcala is 3- alanine, and x and y is unidentified amino acid derivates. mutual peptides in niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> are highlighted in dark grey and light grey. see [additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the peptide structure and more details on ms data.* peptide named oscillapeptin e and **peptide named oscillapeptin d

comparison of the 205-oci and 116-oci gene clusters
anticipating that two strains producing almost identical cyanopeptolins also should contain similar gene clusters, we sequenced a cyanopeptolin gene cluster in nies  <dig>  using primers designed for the cyanopeptolin  gene cluster in niva cya  <dig>   <cit> . the two gene clusters, including the abc transporter genes and the intergenic spacers, were highly similar , and the domain structures of the encoded synthetases were almost identical; except that 205-oci contained an epimerase encoding -domain between t <dig> and c <dig> . the position of the e-domain corresponds to the htyr in d-configuration in oscillapeptin e determined by itou et al  <cit> . both gene clusters included a ga-domain and a sulfotransferase domain. comparison with cyanopeptolin gene clusters characterized in microcystis   <cit>  and anabaena   <cit>   showed a higher degree of similarity within the planktothrix genus than between genera . a-domains and a-domain binding pockets signatures were identified from the gene clusters and aligned. the binding pocket signatures in 116-oci and the corresponding 205-oci signatures were identical, except for 116-ocib-a <dig>  and 205-ocib-a <dig>  . corresponding pairs of 205-oci and 116-oci a-domains clustered together in phylogenetic analyses that included a-domains from cyanopeptolin  <cit> , microcystin  <cit>  nostocyclopeptide  <cit>  and nostopeptolide  <cit>  synthetases .

e-domains are common in cyanobacterial nrps, found in microcystin, aeruginosin and nostocyclopeptide synthetases, notably, e-domains have until now not been found in cyanopeptolin synthetases. the e-domain produces the d-isomer of the amino acid activated by the upstream a-domain and is also involved in the stereospecific selection of the d-isomer for incorporation in the peptide product. most e-domains are flanked by t - and c-domains with special motives  <cit> , and this was the case also in 205-oci – as shown by the phylogenetic analyses .

the nies 205-e-domain is localized downstream of 205-a <dig> and t <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis of e-domains , including e-domains from microcystin synthetase  and nostocyclopeptide synthetase , showed a close relationship between ncpa-e and 205-ocia-e .

phylogenetic analyses of the c-domains , including domains from cyanopeptolin  <cit> , microcystin  <cit>  nostocyclopeptide  <cit>  and nostopeptolide  <cit>  synthetases, clustered according to presence or absence of an upstream e-domain. the 205-oci-c2-domain grouped with d-amino acid-specific c-domains, while the other 205-oci-c domains formed a clade with the corresponding 116-oci-c-domains.

the specialized te-domains associated with e-domains, show major differences within the core t motif compared to standard t-domains  <cit> . comparisons of regular t-domains and te-domains, including 205-oci-te <dig>  mcna-t <dig> and ncpa-te1-domain, showed an h/d and l/i difference in addition to a gap in the te-domain motif . n-terminal t-domains, including both 116-t <dig> and 205-t <dig>  could also be distinguished from te-domains and regular t-domains .

other genomic regions confirm a close relationship between the planktothrix strains
several markers were sequenced to further study the relationship between planktothrix niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig>  the dna sequences , a part of ntca , a global transcriptional regulator of nitrogen assimilation in cyanobacteria, and the phycocyanin spacer cpcba) displayed 100% identity between the two strains.

variation in substitution rates throughout the cyanopeptolin gene clusters
investigation of the substitution rates within the  <dig> kb 116- and 205-oci gene cluster alignment can identify both putative recombination events and regions under specific selection pressure. the region containing the epimerization domain  was excluded due to too large overall differences to produce a reliable alignment. figure  <dig> shows segregating sites  and nonsynonymous vs. synonymous substitution rates  in a sliding window analysis of the alignment. only a few scattered substitutions can be seen in the first part, containing the abc transporter, ga, t <dig>  s and c <dig> domains, and in the last part, containing a <dig>  m, t <dig>  c <dig>  a <dig>  t <dig> and te domains. however, the c <dig> and a <dig> domains contained several substitutions and the rate of mutations in nonsynonymous sites compared with synonymous sites  exceeded  <dig> – a putative sign of positive selection. a high substitution rate was also observed in a small region in c <dig> and the last part of a <dig>  but the ka/ks ratios did not exceed  <dig> 

discussion
correlation between cyanopeptolin gene clusters and peptides
the presence of two highly similar nrps gene clusters  in niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig>  and the production of nearly identical peptides by the two strains corroborate the association between the oci gene cluster and cyanopeptolin- <dig> proposed by rounge et al  <cit> . this association is further substantiated by high degree of similarity to the cyanopeptolin gene cluster in anabaena , where the functional relationship between genes and peptides has been confirmed by a gene knock-out study  <cit>  – as well as similarity to the microcystis cyanopeptolin gene cluster   <cit> .

global dispersal and distribution of cyanopeptolin genes
based on the genomic regions studied here, two planktothrix strains, niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig>  appear to be closely related despite the geographical separation. this is in accordance with the sequence comparison of 16s rdna  <cit>  identifying identical 16s rdna sequences in japan, china, the netherlands, uk, finland, sweden and norway, and thus may indicate a global distribution of closely related planktothrix strains. since lake Årungen in norway host international rowing competitions, a co-transport of this planktothrix genotype with rowing equipment may be feasible. the data presented here do not allow any conclusions about global distribution without a more thorough analysis. the highly specific differences observed in the oci gene clusters are, independently of geographic distributions, intriguing. our analyses indicate that the differences to some extent are due to positive selection at specific amino acid positions.

variation in peptide content due to lack of specificity in the a-domains?
previous studies have shown that lack of specificity in a-domains leads to activation of several amino acids with similar properties, thus giving rise to the synthesis of a series of related peptides from a single nrps system  <cit> . ile/leu/val activating a-domains have been reported in lichenysin biosynthesis  <cit> , and fengycin synthetase  <cit>  among others. it is likely that the 116-oci-a5- and a7-domains can activate leu, ile and val and that the 116-oci-a1- and a3-domains, that mainly activates htyr, also can activate ile and leu. consequently, 116-oci is responsible for production of all seven cyanopeptolin detected in niva cya  <dig> in this study. likewise, 205-oci probably is responsible for all oscillapeptin variants. the biological significance of a single nrps complex giving rise to several peptide variants is yet to be determined.

six of the seven binding pockets signatures of corresponding a-domains in nies  <dig> and niva cya  <dig> are identical . if the different peptide profiles observed in the two strains are due to genetic differences in the nrps genes, they are likely to be due to differences not involving the amino acids constituting the binding pocket signatures. lc-ms-ms-analyses were performed on strains cultivated on the same media, but we cannot completely exclude substrate availability as a contributory cause of variable peptide amount and peptide profile in the strain.

module exchange and amino acid configuration
over a stretch of total of  <dig> kb including the abc transporter, the 116-oci and 205-oci gene clusters are remarkable similar, except for the modules encoding the t2--c <dig> domains. too low sequence similarity is found between the whole t2--c <dig> modules in niva cya  <dig> and nies  <dig> to make a reliable alignment, suggesting that in one of these strains an entire module may have been exchanged through recombination. the e-domain trees  show a close relationship between cyanobacterial e-domains.

sequence similarity to other e-domains and the distinctive flanking c  and t  domains observed by phylogenetic analysis indicate that the oci-e-domain is an active epimerase, and are responsible for epimerization of htyr to d-configuration. the configuration of the amino acids in cyanopeptolin- <dig> were not determined however, a d-htyr in oscillapeptin e and a putative l-htyr in cyanopeptolin- <dig> might explain the small difference between the oligopeptides with regard to polarity observed by hplc analysis, as reported by rounge et al.  <cit> .

interestingly, in the corresponding region of the mcn cyanopeptolin synthetase in microcystis the mcna-t <dig> and mcnb-c <dig> include motifs suggesting association with an e-domain  <cit> . in this case, however, no e-domain is present.

sequence conservation and selection within cyanopeptolin modules
the two cyanopeptolin gene clusters  are highly similar also at the third codon position. the first part  and last part  of the planktothrix cyanopeptolin gene cluster are nearly identical, despite the geographical distance separating the strains. mechanisms for such sequence conservation may be frequent homology-driven genetic exchange within a genotype, leading to homogenization – in line with the general models suggested by rudi et al.  <cit> , gogarten et al. <cit>  and papke et al.  <cit> . or alternatively sequence conservation may be due to low evolutionary rates caused by purifying selection or very short time of independent evolution.

analysis of segregating sites and rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions  indicate that module  <dig>  is different from the remaining domains by displaying higher substitution rates and signs of positive selection at several sites . this is the module responsible for incorporation of the amino acid at position aa <dig> in the peptide.

according to data from itou et al  <cit> , a single amino acid replacement in the aa <dig> position of oscillapeptin e and f alters the protease inhibitory profile, indicating that this position could be pivotal for the inhibitory activity of cyanopeptolins. positive selection in the third module could thus be expected to increase the adaptability of the inhibitory- or other putative functions of cyanopeptolin.

CONCLUSIONS
the planktothrix strains of japan and norway harbor almost identical cyanopeptolin gene clusters and display very similar  cyanopeptolin profiles. the notable gene cluster difference is the presence of an epimerase in nies  <dig> corresponding to a d-htyr in ocillapeptin e. within a single gene cluster we have demonstrated both positive selection and purifying selection, the first promoting new gene cluster variants following recombination, the latter maintaining a high degree of conservation of the major parts of the gene cluster.
