BACKGROUND
plant growth depends greatly on water absorption from the soil and the movement of water from the roots to other plant parts
 <cit> . however, environmental stresses such as drought, salt and cold can lead to water loss in plants. such environmental stresses severely affect plant growth and productivity worldwide. translocation of water is an important process to maintain the ability to tolerate desiccation and high salt stresses
 <cit> . in plants, water movement is controlled by both apoplastic and symplastic pathways
 <cit> . when plants are experiencing abiotic stress, the symplastic pathway is efficient for transporting water across membranes
 <cit> , and the symplastic pathway is regulated mainly by members of the aquaporin family of proteins
 <cit> .

aquaporins  transport water as well as other small molecules such as glycerol, co <dig> and boron through membranes
 <cit> . biological activities associated with aqps are diverse and include seed germination, stomatal movement, cell elongation, reproductive growth, phloem loading and unloading and stress responses in plants
 <cit> . many genes encoding aqp proteins have been identified from different plant species, including  <dig> from arabidopsis <cit> ,  <dig> from rice
 <cit>  and  <dig> from maize
 <cit> . these orthologs can be subdivided into four groups characterized by highly conserved amino acid sequences and stereotypical intron positions within each group: the tonoplast intrinsic proteins , the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , the nodulin-like plasma membrane intrinsic proteins  and the small intrinsic proteins 
 <cit> .

the expression and biological activities of aqps are affected by a number of signals, including abiotic stresses, plant hormones and light
 <cit> . the regulation and biochemical functions of aqps in response to abiotic stresses are complex and not well understood. in a number of transgenic approaches, some aqps have been demonstrated to confer tolerance to abiotic stresses
 <cit> . for example, overexpression of taaqp <dig> results in increased root elongation under salt stress
 <cit> . tobacco ntaqp <dig> is involved in improving water use efficiency, hydraulic conductivity, and yield production under salt stress
 <cit> . however, overexpression of a distinct aquaporin, hvpip2; <dig>  leads to an increased transpiration rate and slightly decreased intrinsic water-use efficiency
 <cit> . these attempts to use aqps to improve crop tolerance to abiotic stresses have yielded contradictory results depending on the isoforms of aqps. therefore isoforms that are shown to confer improved physiological status under stress are of major importance in crop science.

banana  is a large annual monocotyledonous herbaceous plant found in tropical and subtropical climates, and is one of the most popular fresh fruits enjoyed worldwide. because banana has shallow roots and a permanent green canopy, it is especially sensitive to conditions that lead to water deficit
 <cit> . a better understanding of the mechanisms employed by banana plants to tolerate abiotic stresses will be helpful for increasing crop production and quality of this economically valuable fruit. in banana, only one aquaporin gene, musapip1; <dig>  has been characterized as a positive factor in abiotic stress tolerance. transgenic plants overexpressing musapip1; <dig> constitutively exhibited better abiotic stress survival characteristics including lower malondialdehyde content, elevated relative water content, elevated proline levels and a higher photosynthetic efficiency relative to controls under different abiotic stress conditions
 <cit> . in our previous study, a transcript displaying upregulated expression at the early stage of post-harvest banana ripening was identified by cdna microarray
 <cit> . sequence analysis suggested that this cdna fragment exhibited high similarity to aqp genes from other plant species. in this study, a full-length cdna encoding mapip1; <dig> was cloned and characterized. we investigated the function of mapip1; <dig> during drought and salt stresses, which will lead to increased understanding of the mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance employed by plants.

RESULTS
banana mapip1; <dig> encodes a pip1-subfamily aquaporin
a cdna fragment was identified by cdna microarray from genes that were differentially expressed at the early stage of post-harvest banana ripening and the full-length cdna, designated as mapip1; <dig> , was obtained using the rapid amplification of cdna ends  method. the full-length mapip1; <dig> cdna is 1123 bp in length with a 861 bp open reading frame  that encodes  <dig> amino acids. blastx analysis demonstrated that mapip1; <dig> had 94% sequence identity with hcpip <dig> from hedychium coronarium and ospip1; <dig> from oryza sativa japonica group. the predicted mapip1; <dig> protein has a highly conserved amino acid sequence  characteristic of the mip family, six putative transmembrane helices and two ‘npa’ motifs . phylogenetic analysis of mapip1; <dig> with other aqps from arabidopsis and rice that mapip1; <dig> is close to pip <dig> subfamily . these results suggest that the mapip1; <dig> gene cloned in this study is a member of the pip <dig> subfamily in banana.

mapip1; <dig> localizes to the plasma membrane
to determine the subcellular localization of the mapip1; <dig> protein, its orf was introduced into pcambia1304-gfp vector upstream of the gfp gene to create a mapip1;1-gfp translational fusion construct. the mapip1;1-gfp fusion and the plasma membrane-localized maker pm-rk were co-expressed in onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment and we observed that the green fluorescence mapip1;1-gfp and red pm-rk were both confined to the plasma membrane . these results indicate that mapip1; <dig> is targeted to the plasma membrane.

expression of mapip1; <dig> in different banana organs and after various stress treatments
to investigate the expression of mapip1; <dig> in different banana organs, total rna was extracted from leaves, roots, stems, flowers and fruits, converted to cdna and subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis. mapip1; <dig> transcripts were detected in all organs examined and the gene was most abundantly expressed in roots . to determine the transcriptional response of mapip1; <dig> to abiotic stress, various stress treatments were applied to banana plants. the results indicated that the expression of mapip1; <dig> was induced in leaves and roots after salinity stress and simulated drought treatments. the highest expression levels of mapip1; <dig> were observed when banana seedlings were treated with nacl for 6 h and at a soil water capacity at 45% . however, the expression of mapip1; <dig> in leaves and roots was inhibited by chilling treatment . taken together, these results suggest that mapip1; <dig> transcript levels were affected by various stress treatments.

phenotypic analysis of mapip1; <dig> overexpressing arabidopsis transgenic lines
to further understand the role of mapip1; <dig> in planta, mapip1; <dig> was introduced into pcambia <dig> vector under the control of the 35s promoter. after floral-dip transformation of arabidopsis, five hygromycin-resistant transgenic lines from the t <dig> generation were investigated by southern analysis. these results showed that 35s::mapip1;1– <dig>  and 35s::mapip1;1– <dig>  lines each integrated two copies of the mapip1; <dig> transgene, while 35s::mapip1;1– <dig> , 35s::mapip1;1– <dig>  and 35s::mapip1;1– <dig>  lines each integrated one copy of mapip1; <dig> . the expression levels of mapip1; <dig> in the transgenic lines were also monitored. l <dig> and l <dig> exhibited higher levels of mapip1; <dig> expression than the other transgenic lines, which is consistent with the copy number of mapip1; <dig> determined by southern analysis . transgenic mapip1; <dig> overexpression lines exhibited longer primary root length, fewer emerged lateral roots and more abundant root hairs than untransformed controls . these results suggest that mapip1; <dig> overexpression influences root development under typical arabidopsis growth conditions.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> enhances tolerance to salt stress
to investigate the role of mapip1; <dig> during salt stress, wild-type  arabidopsis and mapip1; <dig> overexpression lines were subjected to salinity treatments. root growth was enhanced in the transgenic lines compared to wt seedlings under control and high salt conditions. in nacl conditions ranging from 50 mm to 150 mm, the transgenic seedlings exhibited reduced suppression of primary root length and more abundant root hairs than did wt seedlings . furthermore, when mature arabidopsis plants were subjected to 350 mm nacl treatment for  <dig> d in soil, the transgenic lines exhibited better growth and a higher survival rate than wt plants . these results indicate that mapip1; <dig> overexpressing transgenic lines were more tolerant to salt stress than wt arabidopsis.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> reduces mda content and il under salt stress
increased salt tolerance in transgenic lines relative to the wt led us to investigate physiological differences between mapip1; <dig> overexpression lines and wt plants. malonaldehyde  is a product of lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species , and is used to evaluate ros-mediated injury in plants
 <cit> . the mda content was lower in transgenic seedlings and in the leaves of the mapip1; <dig> transgenic lines compared to wt under salt conditions . ion leakage , an important indicator of membrane injury, exhibited a pattern similar to mda content in leaves and was also lower in the transgenic lines compared to wt under salt conditions . these results suggest that mapip1; <dig> overexpression lines experienced less lipid peroxidation and membrane injury under salt stress.

overexpression of mapip1;  <dig> decreases k+ and na+ accumulation and increases the k+/na+ ratio under salt stress
under highly saline conditions, plant cells retain a high cytosolic k+/na+ ratio in order to survive
 <cit> . to investigate whether mapip1; <dig> influences the cellular k+/na+ ratio, the k+ and na+ contents in the roots and leaves of transgenic lines and wt plants were examined in standard conditions and after salinity treatment . the accumulation of k+ in leaves was reduced in the transgenic lines compared to wt under normal conditions. however, after salt treatment, k+ and na+ were both depleted in the roots and leaves of the transgenic lines in comparison to wt. moreover, the leaves of the transgenic lines maintained a higher k+/na+ ratio than did wt plants during salt treatment. these results suggest that mapip1; <dig> overexpression decreased accumulation of cellular k+ and na+ and improved the k+/na+ ratio under salt stress.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> enhances tolerance to osmotic and drought stresses
to examine the osmotic tolerance of mapip1; 1-overexpressing transgenic plants, mannitol treatment was applied to transgenic and wt seedlings. the transgenic lines exhibited longer primary roots and more abundant root hairs than wt seedlings with or without mannitol treatment . to determine whether mapip1; <dig> plays a role in drought stress, transgenic plants and wt arabidopsis plants were subjected to drought treatment. the transgenic plants displayed better growth, more green leaves, higher survival rates and lower water loss rate compared to wt under drought conditions . these results indicate that overexpression of mapip1; <dig> improved tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses.

overexpression of mapip1;  <dig> reduces il and mda content, and increases proline accumulation and osmotic potential under drought stress
drought stress leads to oxidative injury and disruption of osmotic balance. to investigate the function of mapip1; <dig> in these physiological processes, il, mda, proline and osmotic potential were quantified in the transgenic lines and wt plants under normal and drought conditions. although no difference in mda, il, proline content and osmotic potential was observed in the transgenic lines compared to wt under normal growth conditions, reduced mda and il and higher proline content and osmotic potential were observed in leaves of transgenic lines compared to wt under drought treatment . these results indicate that the transgenic lines experienced less lipid peroxidation and membrane injury, and improved osmotic adjustment under drought treatment.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> decreases the expression of aba-responsive genes
to gain a deeper understanding of mapip1; <dig> function in abiotic stress tolerance, the expression of several aba-responsive genes, namely rd29a, rd29b, rab <dig> and kin <dig> was examined in wt plants and the mapip1;1-overexpression lines
 <cit>  . under standard growth conditions, we observed no significant difference in the transcription of tested genes in the transgenic lines compared to wt plants. however, transgenic seedlings exposed to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 10 h of dehydration or salt treatment exhibited reduced expression of rd29a, rd29b, rab <dig> and kin <dig> compared to wt seedlings that were similarly treated. these results indicate that mapip1; <dig> overexpression leads to downregulated expression of aba-responsive genes during dehydration and salt stresses.

discussion
mapip1; <dig> plays a positive role in mediating drought and salt stress responses
several lines of evidence have shown that aqps are involved in abiotic stress tolerance
 <cit> . in our study, we observed that expression of mapip1; <dig> in leaves and roots was significantly induced after drought and salt treatment, implying that this gene product may play a positive role in mediating responses to drought and salt stresses. to better understand the function of mapip1; <dig> during abiotic stress, we generated a number of mapip1;1-overexpressing arabidopsis transgenic lines. the transgenic seedlings and adult plants exhibited increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses compared to wt. these results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that overexpression of aqp genes confers abiotic stress tolerance to transgenic plants
 <cit> .

expression of mapip1; <dig> is associated with reduced membrane injury
na+ is toxic to cell metabolism and has a deleterious effect on some proteins. high na+ levels also reduce photosynthesis and lead to oxidative damage
 <cit> . additionally, drought stress can induce a rapid accumulation of ros leading to damage of the cell membrane and oxidation of proteins, lipids, and dna
 <cit> . mda, the product of lipid peroxidation caused by ros, can be used to evaluate ros-mediated injuries in plants
 <cit> . il is also an important indicator of membrane injury. thus, mda content and il were measured to assess the role of mapip1; <dig> overexpression in reducing membrane injury under drought or salt conditions. mapip1; <dig> overexpression resulted in decreased il and mda content relative to wt, indicating that mapip1;1-overexpressing plants may experience less lipid peroxidation and membrane injury under salt or drought conditions. consistent with our findings, taaqp7-overexpressing tobacco plants show lower levels of mda and il when compared to wt under drought stress and bjpip1-overexpressing plants exhibit reduced mda and il under cd stress
 <cit> . overexpression of ospip2; <dig> in rice results in decreased il under chilling stress and taaqp8-overexpressing tobacco plants exhibit reduced mda and il relative to wt plants under salt stress
 <cit> . collectively these studies indicate that aqps play a vital role in decreasing il and mda, thereby reducing membrane injury under various abiotic stresses. aqps participate in the rapid transmembrane water flow during growth and development in plants. when plants are subjected to drought or salt conditions, increased transport of water across membranes is crucial to maintain a healthy physiological status. we also observed that mapip1;1-overexpressing plants subjected to drought or salinity treatments exhibited better growth than the wt plants. we surmise that physiological improvements conferred by mapip1; <dig> overexpression contribute to plants maintaining the protein machinery and hence reducing membrane injury.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> improves ion distribution under salt conditions
a large number of different ion transporters and channel proteins, such as sos <dig>  nhx and hkt, are situated in the plasma membrane. these proteins play crucial roles in maintaining ion homeostasis during a variety of abiotic stresses. for example, atsos <dig> and slsos <dig> are membrane-bound na+/h+ antiporters that improve salt stress tolerance by exporting na+ <cit> . the reduced membrane injury observed in mapip1;1-overexpression lines led us to examine k+ and na+ accumulation in wt plants and transgenic lines. mapip1; <dig> overexpression decreases the accumulation of cellular k+ and na+ and improves the k+/na+ ratio under salt stress. previous studies have also reported that aquaporins regulate the distribution of na+ and k+ under salt stress. tanip-overexpressing plants exhibit higher k+ and lower na+ levels compared to wt plants under salt stress
 <cit> . taaqp8-overexpressing tobacco plants have elevated na+ and k+ levels in roots, reduced na+ and increased k+ in stems compared to wt plants under salt treatment
 <cit> . although overexpression of aquaporins appears to cause different patterns of altered na+ and k+ distribution, the evidence suggests that these lead to improved k+/na+ ratios under salt conditions. in recent years, a high cytosolic k+/na+ ratio has become an accepted marker of salinity tolerance
 <cit> . therefore, the increased salt stress tolerance conferred by mapip1; <dig> overexpression may be due to not only decreased membrane injury but also the increased k+/na+ ratio in transgenic lines.

overexpression of mapip1; <dig> improves osmotic adjustment under drought conditions
maintaining the ability to retain water is vital for plants to combat drought stress. aqps function in rapid transmembrane water flow during growth and development and play important roles in maintaining plant water relations under drought conditions. we observed that mapip1;1-overexpressing plants exhibited better growth and a lower rate of water loss compared to wt plants under drought conditions, indicating a positive influence of mapip1; <dig> on water retention. consequently, we investigated the physiological mechanisms involved in improved water retention conferred by mapip1; <dig>  when plants experience drought conditions, the accumulation of compatible osmolytes is employed as a strategy to maintain osmotic adjustment. one such compatible solute is the amino acid proline, whose accumulation functions to decrease the cellular osmotic potential and to enhance cellular protection
 <cit> . mapip1;1-overexpressing transgenic plants maintained higher levels of proline and osmotic potential compared to wt plants subjected to similar drought treatment, implying that mapip1; <dig> may function in maintaining osmotic adjustment under drought stress. the reduced membrane injury conferred by overexpression of mapip1; <dig> may also contribute to improved osmotic adjustment under drought stress.

reduced expression of aba-responsive genes in mapip1;1-overexpressing plants reflects their improved physiological status
dehydration can lead to inhibition of physiological processes; therefore plants initiate adaptive mechanisms to survive osmotic stresses
 <cit> . aba-dependent signal transduction pathways play crucial roles in the adaptation of plants to stress
 <cit> . when arabidopsis plants were subjected to water stress, some aba-responsive genes, such as rd29a, rd29b, kin <dig> and rab <dig> showed increased transcript levels, indicating that the injury resulted from water stress induces the expression of aba-responsive genes
 <cit> . we examined the expression of these aba-responsive genes in mapip1;1-overexpressing transgenic seedlings in relation to wt seedlings. the aba-responsive genes were downregulated in the transgenic seedlings subjected to dehydration or salt treatments in comparison to similarly treated wt seedlings. this result suggests that the mapip1;1-overexpressing transgenic plants were less responsive to aba signaling compared to wt plants, implying that mapip1;1-overexpressing plants have improved physiological status under drought and salt stress conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study demonstrated a role for mapip1; <dig> function in improving tolerance to drought and salt stresses. mapip1; <dig> overexpression resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt stress not only by reducing membrane injury but also by maintaining a higher cellular k+/na+ ratio. enhanced drought stress tolerance conferred by mapip1; <dig> is related to decreased membrane injury and improved osmotic balance. these findings further our understanding of the mechanisms of environmental stress on plants and highlight the role of aqps in reducing membrane injury, improving ion distribution and maintaining osmotic balance. it is necessary to point out that heterologous expression of banana mapip1; <dig> in arabidopsis results in these conclusions that are valid for such a heterologous system, but may not be the same in other plants. further studies are required to characterize the function of mapip1; <dig> in banana.
