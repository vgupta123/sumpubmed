BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  single-stranded non-coding rna  molecules. they are processed from hairpin precursors of approximately  <dig> nt , which in turn are extracted from primary transcripts   <cit> . mirnas can repress gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3' untranslated regions  of their target mrnas  <cit> . in animal genomes, mirnas are found in various genomic locations; while most are located in intergenic regions, some are found to be hosted within the introns of pre-mrnas or within longer ncrna genes  <cit> . interestingly, known mirna genes, both hosted and non-hosted, are often observed to be clustered  <cit> . a cluster usually includes two or three mirna genes, but larger clusters have also been identified, including a human mir- <dig> cluster comprising  <dig> mirna genes and a human mir- <dig> cluster comprising  <dig> mirna genes. baskerville and bartel found that mirnas within  <dig> kb are highly correlated in expression across  <dig> different human organs, indicating that  <dig> kb might be used as preliminary definition for mirna cluster  <cit> .

although mirnas in a given cluster are usually phylogenetically related in sequence, many human clusters containing mirnas without apparent sequence homology are also found  <cit> . a plausible but yet-to-be validated possibility is that the clustered mirnas are functionally related by virtue of targeting the same gene or different genes in the same pathway  <cit> . studies of individual cases have to some extent supported this hypothesis. for instance, mir-15a- <dig> cluster act as tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer by controlling cell survival, proliferation and invasion  <cit> . in gastric cancer, mir-106b cluster and mir- <dig> cluster are upregulated and modulate cell cycle by targeting the cip/kip family proteins  <cit> . the frequently studied mir-17- <dig> cluster acts not only in tumor formation but also in development of heart, lungs, and immune system  <cit> . three individual mirnas of the mir-379- <dig> cluster are required for activity-dependent development of hippocampal neurons  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> of a let- <dig> family cluster function together to regulate developmental timing in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . however, apart from these individual cases, the hypothesis has not yet been systematically investigated.

here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the conservation and functional consequence of mirna clustering. we show that clustered mirnas have functional relatedness through co-targeting proteins in close proximity of ppi network.

RESULTS
mirna clusters' construction and property
it has been reported that clusters may contain unrelated mirnas  <cit> . but the frequency of such heterogeneity has not been comprehensively evaluated. prior research  <cit>  has identified the clustering of  <dig> registered human mirna genes, using the strategy proposed by altuvia et al.  <cit> . according to mirbase  <cit> , the number of registered mirna genes has doubled. still more homologs of the known mirnas are expected in human genome, especially when more and more mirna genes derived from tes  have recently been identified  <cit> .

in order to analyze the genomic clustering of mirnas as systematically and exhaustively as possible, we conducted a cross-species blast search of known pre-mirna sequences in the entire human, mouse and rat genomes. in rat genome we found  <dig> novel mirna loci that are homologues of previously annotated human or mouse mirnas, whereas the corresponding numbers of loci in the mouse and human genomes are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . we clustered mirna genes within  <dig> kb of each other according to bartel et al.  <cit> . after filtering with rna polymerase ii promoter analysis software and expression profiles , a total of  <dig> mirna clusters representing  <dig> unique mirna combinations have been identified in human genome. clusters composed of only hsa-mir- <dig> were not included, since hsa-mir- <dig> is thought to be derived from repeat sequence alu, which is pervasive in the human genome  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> clusters representing  <dig> unique mirna combinations were found in mouse , and  <dig> mirna clusters, all unique, were identified in rat.

in recent releases of mirbase, similar mirna precursors are assembled into mirna families  based on computational analysis and manual inspection. mirnas in a family have been shown to be phylogenetically related  <cit> . we further mapped the mirnas in our data to their families according to mirbase's assignment. as results,  <dig> distinct mirna clusters were identified at family level in human genome, along with  <dig> in mouse, and  <dig> in rat . after mapping to families,  <dig> clusters have been found to be conserved among the three species, which take up 56% in human, 61% in mouse and 74% in rat .

approximately half of the identified clusters are composed of multiple mirna families and are denoted as mirna hetero-cluster throughout this paper. on average, a hetero-cluster contains three mirna families, and around half of the mirna genes in a hetero-cluster do not belong to the main family . additionally, even mirnas in the same family show sequence divergence and possibly target different proteins. this cluster heterogeneity is unlikely to merely derive from random mutation and retention. the fact that these clusters have been fixed in several modern animal genomes implies some evolutionary advantages of such a mirna gene organization, which may provide an efficient internal mechanism for them to function in coordination  <cit> .

functional coordination on ppi network
coordination among regulators from the transcriptional and mirna regulatory layers has recently drawn great interests  <cit> . to reveal why non-homologous mirnas are found in the same cluster, we analyzed their potential coordination in the context of ppi networks. generally, the coordination of mirnas in a cluster should be analyzed directly through justifying the relative proximity between their targets in the network. however, because of the incompleteness of credible ppi networks  and the low reliability of other integrated databases, we primarily chose to reverse the procedure to analyze whether proteins in close proximity incline to be regulated by mirnas from the same cluster .

we first investigated directly interacting protein pairs. it has recently been reported that interacting protein pairs have a certain propensity to be regulated by the same mirna  <cit> . there may exist a similar tendency that two interacting proteins are also regulated by sc-mirnas. sc-mirnas can fulfil the same function through a complementary approach – by assembling two non-related mirna loci in the same transcriptional unit. before analysis, we prepare the data as follows:

we used hprd as the golden standard positive  dataset, and the dataset generated by rhodes et al.  <cit>  according to protein subcellular localization as the golden standard negative  dataset. comparisons of various mirna target prediction programs suggest that targetscan could achieve both high sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . we therefore employed targetscan predictions for clustered mirnas. for targets of a mirna family, common targets shared by all its mirna members were used. the number of mirna sites is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per transcript for gsp, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for gsn. to specifically evaluate the coordination among different mirna families in a cluster, we constructed a family-represented version of hetero-clusters by mapping mirnas in a cluster to their families, and then having redundancies removed . as a result, the  <dig> hetero-clusters have been collapsed to  <dig> family-represented hetero-clusters. to curb possible bias in the target prediction and isolate the effects of clustering, a control was generated by randomly reshuffling mirnas  among the clusters.

two measures were employed to assess sc-mirnas' coordination: one measure is the number of clusters that regulate the two proteins, which reflects the strength of coordination; the other is the percentage of protein pairs that are regulated by sc-mirnas, which reflects the range of coordination. we calculated the prevalence of mirnas' coordination on the gsp and gsn datasets for real clusters and  <dig>  random cluster sets. interacting proteins are found to have a significantly higher tendency to be co-regulated by mirnas from real than from randomly organized clusters . this tendency towards coordinated regulation was not observed for the gsn dataset, which justifies our study of sc-mirnas' coordination in the context of ppi network. the large coordination measurements detected in random cluster set might be due to: 1) considerable noise exists in current protein-protein interaction data and mirna target prediction; 2) when reshuffling  <dig> mirnas families  in  <dig> hetero-clusters, there is a chance that two families in a real cluster are assigned to a random cluster again; meanwhile, mirnas from the same family, which usually locate in one or two clusters, were dispersed into more clusters in randomization, and hence substantially increased the number of clusters they coincided.

since the interacting pairs demonstrate stronger propensity to be regulated by sc-mirnas than non-interacting pairs, we next asked whether there are some correlation between the propensity and the distance between two proteins in the network. the shortest paths were calculated between all the proteins in gsp dataset. we found a significant negative correlation between the number of clusters regulating the two proteins and the length of the shortest path between them in the ppi network . this result suggests that distance in the ppi network is an important factor with respect to the coordinated regulation from sc-mirnas, and lend further support to our previous finding.

we have also noticed the great variance in the number of clusters regulating an interacting protein pair. still 50% of the directly interacting protein pairs are not co-regulated by mirnas from same cluster, and the numbers of clusters that do regulate them vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  despite the noises and data incompleteness, directly interacting pairs are still likely to enjoy different levels of tendency. therefore, we studied another factor, connectivity, that might influence this propensity.

connectivity, the number of neighbours, is one of the most important properties of a protein node in a ppi network. in general, it quantitatively measures functional complexity and importance of a protein node in the ppi network. we counted all proteins' connectivity in hprd network. the connectivity of proteins in gsp is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and in gsn  <dig>  ±  <dig> . we added up the connectivity of the two proteins in each pair and discovered a positive correlation between connectivity sum and the number of mirna clusters targeting them in gsp . more interestingly, this positive correlation is two times stronger in gsp than gsn . considering the major difference between gsp and gsn is that the shortest path is longer than  <dig> between gsn proteins in hprd network, this result indicates that the sc-mirnas preferentially act on protein pairs within close proximity, rather than those with greater connectivity  in ppi network. it may explain why coordination has mainly been reported in regulating pathways.

rs and p-value were from spearman's rank test. for the test,  <dig> pairs were randomly sampled from gsp and gsn respectively. the last two columns show the results calculated on a random cluster set.

to see whether these observations are robust, the same analysis was performed with pictar prediction set, the overlap of targetscan and pictar prediction set as recommended by sethupathy  <cit> , as well as miranda prediction set with alignment score greater than  <dig> . they all gave very consistent results.

modularity of the targets
a module in networks is a local structure characterized by more internal than external links. since our findings suggest that sc-mirnas favour coordinated regulation of local regions in ppi network, does sc-mirnas' target gene set demonstrate some modularity? xu and wong  <cit>  have found three mirna clusters involved in regulating  <dig> signaling pathways by filtering mouse biocarta pathway data. pathway has been recognized as a common form of modularity in network analysis. here, we explored another form of modularity, network community, in sc-mirnas' targets with respect to hprd network. community structure in networks means the appearance of densely connected groups of vertices, with only sparser connections between groups  <cit> . we have found  <dig> network communities of size no less than  <dig> from hprd network by joining cliques with size  <dig> to  <dig> together, using cfinder  <dig>   <cit> . we selected those network communities with at least 50% proteins targeted by a mirna cluster and at most 40% regulated by any member of the cluster to guarantee that they are co-regulated by the cluster rather than any single member. for the  <dig> community-cluster pairs we obtained, the p-value was calculated based on the overlap of each community with the targets of one thousand simulated mirna clusters of the same size. finally, we obtained  <dig> community-cluster pairs with p <  <dig>  . among them, mir- <dig> cluster's role in transcription regulation through this protein community is well-known  <cit> . xie et al. recently reported mir- <dig> cluster's involvement in histone acetylation in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . another interesting one is mir- <dig> cluster. it targets a network community of ten proteins that are involved in circadian rhythm . although there is no experimental report on it, circadian rhythm is modulated by neural system while mir- <dig> cluster is brain-specific and is required for dendritogenesis  <cit> .

although our work mainly focus on protein-protein interaction data, for it is more complete and more suitable for global analysis, we re-ran our analysis with kegg human pathway data, and presented the results in additional file  <dig> 

coordination and conservation
cluster provides a neat mechanism to transcribe many cooperative mirnas simultaneously. it could hardly be imaged that this exquisite coordination has been generated in a single event; rather, it should have been consolidated through a long period of evolutionary process. to investigate the relationship between coordination and conservation, we have to calculate the target interactions between mirnas in a cluster.

a comparison between human, mouse and rat mirna clusters enables us to classify mirnas in hetero-clusters into two categories: one is conserved mirnas, which are observed in human, mouse and rat clusters; the other is non-conserved mirnas, which exist in human clusters but are unobtainable in mouse or rat clusters. we counted the target interactions irredundantly within and between non-conserved mirnas and conserved mirnas. mirna pairs with targets overlapping more than  <dig> within hprd-recorded proteins were excluded because their mature sequences are so similar as to be suspected of having identical function. we calculated the empirical p-value of each mirna pair's number of target interactions by  <dig>  times randomization of mirna-target protein association. the negative logarithm of p-value  was then used to assess the coordination. the greater -lgp is, the stronger the coordination is. as results,  <dig> % of conserved mirnas pairs have been found to cooperate significantly in regulating ppi network , which comports with our previous finding of intra-cluster coordination. coordination within non-conserved mirnas, however, is much weaker than that within conserved ones in a cluster . in other words, conserved mirnas are generally more cooperative with each other than non-conserved ones in a cluster. the result is consistent on miranda target set.

although results in previous section indicate that mirnas in a cluster may co-regulate proteins in close proximity of ppi network, they provide no information on each mirna cluster's coordination. here, those highly coordinated mirna pairs , conserved and non-conserved, come from  <dig>  hetero-clusters. we have found literature support for the function of  <dig> of them, all listed in additional file  <dig>  thus it can be estimated that at least 30% of the mirna hetero-clusters we can find evidence in current hprd network for their intra-cluster coordination.

discussion
recently, global analysis of mirna targets in the context of sets of genes or ppi network has drawn great interests  <cit> . it could also provide important insights into how mirnas in a cluster cooperate with each other. in this work, we adopted a protein-centered perspective to start our analysis. we fixed a protein set and analyzed the relationship of mirnas that target them. this perspective has advantages in avoiding the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data, and allowing us to analyze mirnas' functionality according to the features of their targets.

by using the protein-centered perspective, we observed that directly interacting proteins incline to be regulated by mirnas in the same cluster. the closer these proteins are in the ppi network, the more likely the targeting mirnas are located in the same cluster. proteins usually fulfill certain functions by means of interaction. if their functions are temporarily not needed, then their expressions should be reduced simultaneously. mirnas in a cluster transcribed as polycistron would provide a competent and efficient mechanism to achieve this goal. our further analysis reveals that connectivity is another factor that matters only when proteins interact or are at least close in ppi network. interacting proteins, both with great connectivity, usually connect two functional protein groups. they would be under stronger selective pressure to consent to a mirna cluster's regulation. if one of them was not regulated in time, the module it involved would likely be still in function, and the coordination of the whole system would be greatly impaired.

the finding that distance is more important than connectivity suggests that sc-mirnas preferentially co-regulate proteins in close proximity of a ppi network. however, this may also be due to the fact that ppi network are mainly gathered from high-throughput experiments which focus on physical interactions, such as yeast two hybrid system and tandem affinity purification. therefore, for two proteins with long distance in ppi network, even their concurrence in time and space could not be guaranteed. to overcome this limitation, other information, such as signaling network or transcriptional regulatory network, would be needed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study supports the putative hypothesis of internal coordination among sc-mirnas to regulate downstream biological networks. the linkage of sc-mirnas' functional coordination and their targets' topological features we found highlights the potential to further investigate their subtle relationship.
