BACKGROUND
the availability of nitrate strongly affects both crop productivity and food quality. in fact, in agricultural well-aerated soils, this anion is the main source of nitrogen for the majority of crops. the mechanisms by which nitrate is transported into the roots have been characterized both at physiological and molecular levels. it has been demonstrated that nitrate is taken up by a four-component uptake machinery  <cit> . two saturable high-affinity transport systems  are involved in nitrate transport at low concentration . one of is constitutive,  and the other substrate-inducible . the other two systems clats and ilats, the constitutive and inducible low affinity transport systems, respectively, mediate a non-saturable transport, which becomes relevant at concentrations higher than 1 mm. even at the highest nitrate concentrations likely to be found in the soil solution the transport of the anion into the root cells is an active process coupled to a favourable h+ electrochemical gradient created by the plasma membrane  h+-atpase  <cit> . hats and lats are encoded by different gene families  whose products act as nh+/no3- symporters  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana seven nrt <dig> <cit>  and eleven nrt <dig> <cit>  gene homologues have been identified. however, only a limited number of them are considered to be responsible for nitrate uptake from the soil  <cit> . in arabidopsis nrt <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to play a major role in ihats flux and nrt <dig>  in ilats. however, this last gene encodes a dual-affinity nitrate-transporter  <cit> , which might also contribute to ihats. as far as constitutive transport is concerned, while it has been possible to assign the lats function to the atnrt <dig>  gene product, the situation regarding hats still appears unclear. regulation of inducible nitrate uptake activity has been shown to take place at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels of nrt <dig> genes  <cit> .

once inside root cells, nitrate can be reduced to ammonium by nitrate- and nitrite reductase and then assimilated into organic nitrogen   <cit> . depending on the plant species or when the capacity for nitrate reduction in roots becomes a limiting factor due to high nitrate supply  <cit> , a substantial proportion of nitrate is loaded into xylem vessels and transported upwards to the shoots. nitrate translocated to the shoots is released from the xylem to the leaf apoplast before being absorbed by the leaf symplast. in contrast to the behaviour of nitrate at root level, little is known about nitrate transport towards different plant tissues recently, a role in nitrate petiole storage has been attributed to atnrt  <dig>   <dig> <cit>  and the importance of atnrt  <dig>  for an efficient storage of nitrate in seed vacuoles has been highlighted  <cit> . furthermore it has been suggested that the atnrt  <dig>  gene plays a role in the translocation from maternal tissue to developing embrio  <cit> . an involvement of atnrt <dig>  and atnrt <dig>  genes in root xylem loading and unloading of nitrate, respectively, has also been suggested  <cit> . notwithstanding the importance of nitrate transport at the level of leaf cells, little or no information is available on this process. it has been demonstrated that bundle sheath cells are sites of intensive net proton excretion, which acidifies the apoplast  <cit>  thus allowing a h+/amino acids cotransport across the plasma membrane. from this evidence it has been suggested that the same may hold true for nitrate uptake  <cit> . however, no information is available on the biochemical and physiological characteristics of this process . furthermore, molecular data reporting the expression of nrt <dig> <cit>  and nrt <dig> <cit>  genes in leaves, obtained so far, are lacking of functional analyses connecting the pattern of expression to nitrate uptake. recently, fan et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that in arabidopsis leaves the source-to-sink remobilization of nitrate is mediated by nrt <dig>  expression in phloem cells and that its level is related to the source strength of the leaf. in addition, a role of atnrt <dig>  protein in nitrate unloading from xylem tissue of arabidopsis leaves has been hypothesized  <cit> .

in the present research an attempt was made to characterize the mechanisms of nitrate uptake at the leaf level of n-deprived intact cucumber plants supplied with 4 mm nitrate for up to  <dig> h. the use of infiltrated leaf disc allowed us to show for the first time that mechanisms operating in leaves possess distinct characteristics as evident from the comparison with the features of root nitrate uptake. to gain information on the regulatory aspect of leaf nitrate uptake and the molecular entities underlying the process we analyzed, during nitrate treatment, the variation of nitrate concentration in different plant compartment  and the behavior of nrt genes and pm h+-atpase.

RESULTS
figure  <dig> shows the pattern of high affinity nitrate uptake  by roots and leaf discs of n-deprived cucumber plants exposed to 4 mm nitrate up to  <dig> h. as shown in figure 1a, when the plants were exposed to a nutrient solution containing nitrate, at the root level the net nitrate-uptake rate rapidly increased reaching the maximum level after  <dig> to 6 h of exposure with the solution . at this time, the magnitude of the net nitrate-uptake capacity was 8-fold higher than that recorded in roots at the beginning of the experiment. thereafter, a decline in net nitrate-uptake rate was observed. when the nitrate-uptake was measured in leaf discs , an enhancement in nitrate-uptake rate was evident and became maximal after  <dig> to 12 h of treatment. in this tissue, the extent of the induction was of about  <dig> fold. moreover, prolonging the experiment up to 24 h, the rate of net nitrate uptake only slightly decreased. the same pattern, but with higher extent of induction , was also observed when the leaf discs were put in the contact with an uptake solution with higher  nitrate concentration . thereafter this concentration was used for all the other leaf-uptake experiments.

cell-sap analysis showed that supply of nitrate to the n-deprived plants caused a progressive increase in nitrate concentration either in roots or leaves ; in these latter, the magnitude of anion concentration was about 4-fold higher than that measured at the root level after 24-h treatment.

in xylem sap, nitrate concentration  rapidly increased up to 12 h after the anion supply and thereafter remained constant up to the end of the experiment . in the leaf-apoplastic fluid, anion concentration increased as a consequence of nitrate supply to the plants, being maximal after 9 h of treatment ; afterwards, the levels of nitrate concentration in this fluid decreased rapidly.

in figure  <dig> are reported the kinetic curves of net nitrate uptake by roots and leaf discs measured respectively after 4 h and 12 h of exposure of n-deprived plants to 4 mm nitrate; as control, tissues collected from n-deprived plants before starting the treatment, were used. at root level of nitrate-induced plants, the nitrate uptake rate increased with the rise of the external anion concentration, showing a biphasic pattern with a typical saturation profile up to  <dig>  mm nitrate and a linear kinetic at higher anion concentrations . by contrast, net nitrate uptake by leaf discs of nitrate-induced plants displayed only saturation kinetics . similar patterns but with lower rates of uptake were observed in both tissues of the control  plants.

the kinetic parameters were calculated by using the lineweaver-burk double reciprocal method, in the low external nitrate-concentration range, where the curves displayed saturation kinetics in both roots and leaves. results reported in table  <dig> show that, when the plants were exposed to a nutrient solution containing nitrate, vmax significantly increased either at root  or leaf  level. on the other hand, the apparent km values decreased as a consequence of the nitrate treatment, this behaviour being particularly evident at the root level.

*calculated in the  <dig> - <dig>  mm concentration range. values for km and vmax were obtained using the lineweaver-burk method  of data fitted to the michaelis-menten equation.

net nitrate uptake by leaf discs displayed a marked dependence upon the light, greatest values being reached when the assays were performed in the presence of high light intensity .

in order to evaluate the dependence of nitrate uptake by leaf discs on the activity of the pm h+-atpase, experiments were also performed in the presence of 500 μm vanadate in the uptake medium. the presence of the inhibitor of the proton pump in the uptake medium drastically lowered  the capability of the leaf discs to take up nitrate from the external solution . the dependence of net nitrate uptake by leaf discs upon the ph of the external medium was evaluated at ph intervals ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . net nitrate-uptake rates were essentially unaffected by ph raising from  <dig>  up to values of  <dig> , while a progressive inhibition was observed when the solution was buffered at higher ph .

to verify whether the modification of pm h+-atpase occurred concomitantly with the nitrate-uptake induction, pm -enriched vesicles were isolated from roots and leaves of n-deprived or nitrate-induced  of intact cucumber plants. based on the effects of selective inhibitors on pm h+-atpase activity, membrane preparations appeared enriched in plasma membrane vesicles. vanadate inhibited pm h+-atpase activity by 85% and 89% in leaf and root respectively. moreover, the nitrate treatment did not significantly modify the composition of the isolated membrane-vesicles preparations. the hydrolytic activities and the amounts of pm h+-atpase measured in the vesicle preparations are presented in figure  <dig>  when plants were placed in contact with nitrate for 4 h the specific activity of root pm h+-atpase increased  in relation to that measured in membrane vesicles isolated from roots of n-deprived plants . western blot analysis indicated a relative increase  of the enzyme-steady-state level within plasma-membrane proteins from nitrate-induced roots. for the leaves, following treatment with nitrate for 12 h, the hydrolytic activity and the relative amount of pm h+-atpase were respectively  and  higher than the comparative values detected in vesicle preparations isolated from leaves of n-deprived plants .

transcriptional activity of pm h+-atpase genes was investigated by real-time rt-pcr analyses using primers designed from gene sequences of two different h+-atpase isoforms known to be present in cucumber plants: csha <dig>  and csha <dig> gene . pm h+-atpase genes showed different expression patterns during the treatment. at root level , two distinct peaks in transcript abundance were observed for csha <dig> after  <dig>  h and 24 h of nitrate exposure; expression of csha <dig> whose transcript levels were higher, was less modified by the treatment. when the abundance of transcripts was analyzed at the leaf level , results show that the expression level of csha <dig> was unaffected by the nitrate supply to the plants while the expression of csha <dig> increased progressively after nitrate supply to intact plants up to the end of the treatment.

expression of the high-affinity nitrate transporter  gene at the root level increased during the first 3 h of treatment; after 6 h the levels of transcript abundance progressively fell reaching a value similar to that of untreated plants . at the leaf tissue, expression level of this gene was unaffected by the nitrate treatment of plants . from the findings of these transcriptional profiles which suggest that other molecular mechanisms may be involved in nitrate transport in leaf, we performed experiments aimed at identifying genes putatively involved in the transport of nitrate in leaf. degenerate primes were used to amplify sequence of putative members of the nrt <dig> and nrt <dig> gene families using cdna samples obtained from the total rna extracted from both roots  and leaf tissues . only with one combination of primers  a pcr amplification fragment of about 200 bp was obtained. for each cdna sample, the amplified cdna fragments were cloned and two different clones were sequenced. the analysis of the obtained sequences  revealed that all root cdna sequences  had a 100% sequence identity with the same cucumis sativus high-affinity nitrate transporter csnrt <dig> mrna , whose transcriptional levels were previously analyzed by real-time rt-pcr . on the other hand, no specific amplified fragments resulted from the leaf tissues.

the same cdna samples were used as templates for reactions with degenerate primers to amplify two sequence regions of the nrt <dig> gene family. only the nrt1fora and nrt1reva combination of primers amplified a fragment of about 100 bp. however, the blastn analysis of the sequences obtained from two clones for each cdna samples showed no similarity to known nucleotide sequence encoding nrt <dig> proteins.

discussion
in many plant species, considerable amount of nitrate taken up by roots is transported to the leaf cells, where it undergoes reduction to ammonium and conversion to amino acids and other nitrogen containing molecules. consequently, nitrate unloaded from the xylem must be taken up into leaf cells. the mechanism of nitrate uptake across the root plasma membrane of higher plants is suggested to be a h+/no3- symport most likely with a 2: <dig> stoichiometry  <cit> . the accumulated evidence from kinetic studies indicates that roots possess different nitrate uptake systems that have been defined according to their response to external nitrate in terms of concentration-dependence  and inducibility  for review see e.g.  <cit> . the time course experiments of nitrate uptake by roots of nitrate-depleted cucumber plants confirmed a typical response  <cit> : net uptake rates rapidly and consistently increased upon roots exposure to the anion reaching a maximum  <dig> to 6 h  after the beginning of the treatment. thereafter a steep decline of the absorption rate occurred. this pattern, together with saturable kinetics , clearly indicates the occurrence in cucumber roots of ihats during nitrate induction period. furthermore, at the nitrate concentration higher than 2 mm linear non saturable kinetics was evident, thus indicating that the features of nitrate uptake in root of cucumber plants are similar to those already described in several plant species  <cit> .

once taken up by roots, nitrate is loaded into the xylem vessel and translocated to the shoots. in general, the root nitrate reductase activity is usually lower in the region where the nitrate uptake is higher and is responsible for nitrate translocation from these root parts to the shoots  <cit> . while the uptake of nitrate into the root symplast depends on the concentration in the outer medium, the xylem loading process depends mainly on the shoot demand and the content of reduced n-compounds in the phloem  <cit> . in the present study, nitrate concentration in the xylem sap rapidly increased following anion supply , resulting in a higher leaf apoplastic concentration . this implies that leaf cells also experience fluctuating concentration of nitrate in their apoplast. however, as yet information concerning the physiological features of nitrate uptake in leaf tissues is lacking in the literature. our data, obtained with leaf discs, demonstrate that as in the case of roots, the uptake of nitrate in leaves appears to be an inducible process; the enhancement in nitrate-uptake rate reached the maximum after  <dig> to 12 h of the anion treatment . however, the intensity of induction and the entity of the decline of uptake rate were lower compared to the root, possibly indicating that uptake mechanisms operating in leaf tissues possess different sensitivity to regulatory effectors. net nitrate uptake by the leaf discs was stimulated by light  which is in accordance with the findings of peuke and jeschke  <cit>  obtained with barley roots.

in contrast to the roots, net nitrate uptake by leaf discs of nitrate-induced cucumber plants did not exhibit typical biphasic kinetics . although foliar nitrate uptake shows some similarities with the root process , the kinetic pattern  and the intensity of induction indicate that the mechanism operating at the leaf level might be different from those present in roots, which is usually attributed to nrt <dig> , and nrt <dig>  genes. furthermore, km values obtained for cucumber leaf tissues  are out of the range  recorded in roots of several different plant species  <cit>  suggesting an adaptation to higher apoplastic nitrate concentration and the involvement of transporters different from those responsible for nitrate uptake at the root soil interface  <cit> . recently, kinetics similar to those shown in figure 4b  have been demonstrated for the low-affinity nitrate transporter nrt <dig>  in the minor vein phloem of arabidopsis leaves   <cit> .

the involvement of pm h+-atpase in nitrate uptake has been demonstrated in maize roots exposed to fluctuating external nitrate concentration  <cit> . data presented here confirm that also in cucumber roots higher level of nitrate uptake rates are related to an increase in pm h+-atpase activity and quantity . furthermore, nitrate treated roots exhibited differential regulation at transcriptional level of two plasma membrane proton pump isoforms . these data confirm that a different isogene of pm h+-atpase could play a different role in mineral nutrition as suggested for nitrate in maize  <cit>  and iron nutrition in cucumber  <cit>  as well as for phosphorus acquisition by white lupin  <cit> . data obtained using isolated plasma membrane vesicles from leaves of cucumber plants treated for 12 h with nitrate  show, for the first time, that also in this tissue the activity and quantity of the plasma membrane proton pump increase  this finding suggests an involvement of the enzyme in the nitrate uptake process in leaves similar to that described in roots. the transcriptional analysis of csha <dig> and csha <dig> in leaves highlighted a main putative role of the latter isogene in the process . interestingly the expression of this gene was observed in leaves of the cucumber plant irrespective of iron nutritional status this behaviour being different from that of csha <dig> whose expression is modulated in the root both in response to iron shortage  <cit>  and the presence of nitrate .

data obtained from real-time rt-pcr experiments, aimed at analyzing the involvement of the only high affinity nitrate transporter  so far known in cucumber, clearly showed that this gene plays a role in nitrate uptake in roots . however this gene was not modulated in leaves , suggesting that other molecular mechanisms underlie the phenomenon of nitrate uptake in this tissue. the experiments performed to identify other isogenes of high affinity nitrate transporters using degenerate primers  indicate evidence of expression of only csnrt <dig> in root tissue at any time of the nitrate treatment. on the other hand the same approach did not allow amplification of the sequence portion of nrt <dig> genes in leaves. it has been recently hypothesized that atnrt <dig> , nitrate responsive in roots and expressed in xylem tissues both in roots and leaves, is involved in xylem unloading  <cit> . a product of this gene may play a role, at least in part, in the process of nitrate uptake in foliar tissues  <cit> . bearing this in mind we used degenerate primers to attempt identify the putative low affinity nitrate transporter . our finding of lack of evidence of the nrt <dig> gene either in roots or leaves does not necessarily imply that these genes are not expressed in leaf tissues. this is because of the very low sequence similarity among the members of this gene family  <cit> . the molecular entity responsible for the transport of nitrate into leaf cells therefore still remains unresolved.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide for the first time evidence that a saturable and substrate-inducible nitrate uptake mechanism operates in cucumber leaves. its activity appears to be related to that of pm h+-atpase activity and in particular to the induction of csha <dig> isoform.
