BACKGROUND
autophagy-related gene  <dig>  in yeast, datg <dig> in drosophila, uncoordinated- <dig>  in c. elegans, and unc-51-like kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  in mammals are members of the evolutionary conserved uncoordinated-51-like kinase  protein kinase family that play critical roles in macroautophagy  and neuronal development . autophagy is a catabolic process engaged under starvation and other stress conditions  <cit> . a critical step in autophagy is the formation of autophagosomes which trap cytosolic cargo for degradation after fusion with lysosomes  <cit> . genetic studies in yeast identified atg <dig> as an essential gene required for the initiation of autophagy . this function of ulk proteins is conserved in evolution . for this process, atg <dig> forms a protein complex composed of atg1/ulk <dig>  atg <dig>  and atg <dig> , and in mammalian cells also atg <dig> . the atg1/ulk complex phosphorylates several substrates including atg <dig>  <cit>  and the myosin light chain kinase   <cit> , which are required for the formation of autophagosomes. activation of the atg1/ulk complex is also required for the recruitment of the atg6/beclin protein complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure   <cit> . the atg6/beclin complex is composed of atg <dig> , the type iii pi3-k vps <dig>  as well as atg <dig> and vps <dig>  maturation of the pas to autophagosomes requires lipidation of the ubiquitin-like atg8/lc <dig> protein, which is mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, atg <dig> and atg8/lc <dig>  <cit> . critical components in these ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are atg <dig> , atg <dig> and atg <dig> , as well as another protein complex, atg5-atg12-atg <dig>  which serves as an e <dig> ligase for atg8/lc <dig> lipidation . finally, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for degradation of cargo.

in addition to a critical role in autophagy, atg <dig> also has functions outside of autophagy, most notably in neuronal development. this was initially observed in mutants of the ulk ortholog unc- <dig> in c. elegans, which display uncoordinated movement with an underlying axonal defect . a neuronal function of ulk orthologs was subsequently also reported in drosophila, zebrafish and mammals . this autophagy-independent function of ulk proteins does not appear to involve other canonical autophagy proteins, including components of the atg1/ulk protein complex such as atg <dig> and fip <dig>  <cit> . instead, the neuronal function of ulk proteins is dependent on different sets of proteins that include – depending on the organism analyzed – unc- <dig>  vab- <dig> and pp2a , unc- <dig> , and syntenin and syngap  several of which are phosphorylated by ulks . thus, the two known functions of ulk proteins in autophagy and neuronal processes involve different sets of proteins.

apoptosis-induced proliferation  is a specialized form of compensatory proliferation that occurs after massive cell loss due to stress-induced apoptosis . initially described in drosophila where it can compensate for the apoptotic loss of up to 60 % of imaginal disc cells  <cit> , aip has since been observed in many organisms, including classical regeneration models such as hydra, planarians, zebrafish, xenopus, and mouse . interestingly, aip is directly dependent on a non-apoptotic function of caspases that otherwise execute the apoptotic program in the dying cell. in drosophila, the initiator caspase dronc triggers activation of jun-n-terminal kinase  signaling, which leads to the production of mitogens including wingless , decaplentaplegic , and the egf ligand spitz for aip .

however, many mechanistic details of aip are still unknown. therefore, we and others have developed several aip models in eye and wing imaginal discs in drosophila . in the first set of aip models, apoptosis is induced upstream by expression of cell death-inducing factors such as hid or reaper, but blocked downstream by co-expression of the effector caspase inhibitor p <dig>  generating ‘undead’ cells  <cit> . because undead cells do not die and p <dig> does not inhibit the initiator caspase dronc, dronc continues to generate the signals for aip, which causes tissue overgrowth. for example, ey-gal4-driven uas-hid and uas-p <dig>  cause overgrowth of head capsules with ectopic sensory organs such as bristles and ocelli, and in severe cases forms amorphic head tissue   <cit> . the ey > hid-p <dig> undead model is the only known overgrowth-promoting aip model in which adult animals survive  <cit> . other undead aip models, mostly in the wing, such as nub > hid-p <dig> or hh > hid-p <dig> produce enlarged larval wing imaginal discs, but do not allow adult animals to eclose. thus, the ey > hid-p <dig> undead aip model is a convenient tool for genetic screening to identify genes involved in aip by scoring adult flies.fig.  <dig> suppression of ey > hid-p <dig> by loss of datg <dig>  the hyperplastic overgrowth phenotype of ey > hid-p <dig> can be grouped in three categories, weak , moderate  and severe , as previously described  <cit> . moderate flies are characterized by overgrowth of head capsules with duplications of bristles  and ocelli , while severe flies have overgrown and deformed heads with amorphic tissue. each screen analysis was repeated at least twice with scoring more than  <dig> ey > hid-p35/ adult flies. a–h representative dorsal views of adult fly head capsules of the indicated genotypes. a–d compared to the control ey > p <dig>  which is similar to wildtype , percentages of ey > hid-p <dig> flies display weak , moderate  and severe  phenotypes . therefore, over 90 % of ey > hid-p <dig> flies show a clear hyperplastic overgrowth phenotype . e knockdown of datg <dig> by rnai in ey > p <dig> does not cause obvious defects on head capsules. f–h
datg <dig> rnai strongly reduces the percentage of ey > hid-p <dig> flies showing severe  and moderate  overgrowth phenotype and largely extends the population of flies with a weak or wildtype-like appearance . i summary of the suppression of the ey > hid-p <dig> overgrowth phenotype by expressing datg1
rnai or dominant-negative datg1
dn and the enhancement of the phenotype by expressing two constructs encoding datg <dig> . either 25 °c or room temperature  was used for these analyses. the majority of ey > hid-p <dig> flies  display either severe or moderate overgrowth phenotypes at both 25 °c and rt. blue indicates severe, orange indicates moderate, and green indicates weak or wildtype-like phenotypes



the second type of aip models does not involve the use of p <dig> and has been referred to as genuine or regenerative aip  <cit> . these models take advantage of gal80ts, a temperature-sensitive inhibitor of gal <dig>  which allows temporal control of uas-transgene expression by a temperature shift to 29 °c  <cit> . because these aip models are p35-independent, cells complete the apoptotic program and we score the ability of the affected tissue to regenerate the lost cells by new proliferation. in our genuine/regenerative aip model, we express the pro-apoptotic factor hid for 12 h under control of dorsal-eye-gal <dig>  <cit>   in eye imaginal discs during second or early third larval instar  <cit> . this treatment causes massive tissue loss which is regenerated by aip within 72 h after tissue loss.

here, we report the identification of datg <dig> as a suppressor of the overgrowth phenotype of the undead ey > hid-p <dig> aip model. datg <dig> is also required for complete regeneration in the dets-hid aip model. furthermore, we show that datg <dig> is genetically acting downstream of jnk activation, but upstream of mitogen production such as wg. consistently, datg <dig> is transcriptionally induced by jnk activity during aip. interestingly, the involvement of datg <dig> in aip is independent of other datg genes, including datg <dig>  datg17/fip <dig>  datg <dig>  vps <dig>  vps <dig>  datg <dig>  and datg <dig>  these findings suggest that datg <dig> has an autophagy-independent function in aip. finally, datg <dig> is not employing the mechanism used during neuronal development as targeting unc- <dig> did not affect aip. therefore, in addition to a role of datg <dig> in autophagy and neuronal development, we define a third function of datg1 for aip.

RESULTS
datg <dig> is a suppressor of apoptosis-induced proliferation
aip phenotypes of ey > hid-p <dig> animals vary from mild to moderate to severe overgrowth of head capsules characterized by pattern duplications of ocelli, bristles, and sometimes entire antennae  as well as deformed heads with amorphic tissue    <cit> . to identify genes required for aip, we are screening for suppressors of the ey > hid-p35-induced overgrowth phenotypes. for follow-up characterization of identified suppressors, we are using undead and regenerative  aip models in eye and wing imaginal discs.

using this approach, we identified datg <dig> as a strong aip suppressor of ey > hid-p <dig> by rnai . the percentage of ey > hid-p <dig> animals with severe and moderate aip phenotypes is strongly reduced upon datg <dig> knock-down . no effect was scored on control  animals . although datg <dig> rnai results in significant loss of datg <dig> mrna and protein levels  and no off-targets have been reported, we tested additional reagents for an involvement of datg <dig> in aip. expression of a dominant negative datg <dig> transgene also suppressed ey > hid-p35-induced overgrowth . furthermore, increased expression of datg <dig>  which does not alter apoptosis , enhances the aip phenotype and generates many animals with severe aip phenotype . we therefore conclude that datg <dig> is required for tissue overgrowth in the undead aip model.

datg <dig> is required for regenerative apoptosis-induced proliferation
encouraged by the identification of datg <dig> in the undead aip model, we examined an involvement of datg <dig> in the regenerative  dets > hid aip model. when hid expression is induced for 12 h in the dorsal half of the eye imaginal disc, the dorsal half of the eye disc is severely ablated  <cit> . after 72 h recovery , the disc has recovered due to regenerative growth by aip   <cit> . the degree of the regenerative response can be easily assessed by visualization of the photoreceptor pattern using elav as a marker, because photoreceptor differentiation follows tissue growth of the disc  <cit> . dets > hid control discs regenerate a normal elav pattern 72 h after hid-induced tissue ablation . in contrast, dets > hid imaginal discs expressing datg1rnai are unable to fully regenerate the ablated tissue . the elav pattern in the dorsal half of the eye disc is incomplete , suggesting that the regenerative response after hid-induced tissue ablation is partially blocked by datg <dig> rnai. as additional control, dets > datg1rnai alone does not affect the elav pattern . these findings are also confirmed by expression of a dominant negative datg <dig> transgene and quantified in fig. 2d. in summary, these data illustrate that datg <dig> is an important gene required for aip in both undead and regenerative models. we also considered examining the effect of overexpressed datg <dig> in regenerative aip. however, expression of datg <dig> alone using the de-gal <dig> driver triggers strong apoptosis , consistent with a previous report  <cit> , which may complicate the interpretation of the results. therefore, we did not characterize the role of overexpressed datg <dig> in the regenerative aip model.fig.  <dig>

datg <dig> is required for aip downstream of dronc in undead eye and wing imaginal discs
we further characterized the role of datg <dig> for aip with molecular markers. although datg <dig> is best characterized for a role in autophagy, it is theoretically possible that datg <dig> rnai inhibits apoptosis and thus aip indirectly. therefore, we first tested how datg <dig> relates genetically to dronc in the aip pathway. as a marker for dronc activity, we used the cleaved caspase- <dig>  antibody. although apoptosis is blocked by p <dig> expression, the ccasp <dig> antibody still labels undead cells , presumably because dronc also has non-apoptotic substrates  <cit> . datg <dig> rnai suppresses the overgrowth and normalizes the morphology of the ey > hid-p <dig> eye disc as judged by elav labeling . however, ccasp <dig> labeling is not significantly altered by datg <dig> rnai  despite the rescue of disc morphology suggesting that the loss of datg <dig> does not affect caspase activity in undead tissues.fig.  <dig> 
datg <dig> acts genetically downstream of or in parallel to jnk and upstream of wg expression. late third instar eye  or wing  discs, anterior is to the left. the cleaved caspase- <dig>  labeling  indicates activity of dronc in p35-expressing tissues. white dotted lines in  indicate the anterior portion of the eye discs which expresses ey-gal <dig>  elav labels photoreceptor neurons  and is used to mark the posterior differentiating eye field.  in ey > p <dig> control discs, puc-lacz expression  as a marker of jnk/bsk activity is low  in the anterior portion of the eye discs. expression of wg  is restricted to dorsal and ventral edges of the eye discs. dronc activity indicated by ccasp <dig> labeling is low.  in ey > hid-p <dig> discs, dronc activity  is strongly induced in undead anterior tissue . the anterior portion of the discs between the white dotted lines is significantly expanded and displaces the eye field in the posterior portion of the discs . compared to the ey > p <dig> control discs , in the overgrown anterior eye portion, jnk activity  and expression of wg  are strongly induced.  expression of datg1
rnai suppresses hyperplastic overgrowth in about 80 % of the ey > hid-p35-datg1
rnai discs  indicated by the normalized elav pattern. this ratio corresponds to the suppression of the adult overgrowth phenotype . however, puc-lacz expression and ccasp <dig> labeling are not suppressed by datg1
rnai  in contrast to ectopic wg expression, which is blocked  in the anterior portion of the eye discs.  compared to the control wing discs where p <dig> is expressed in the pouch area under the control of nub-gal <dig> , in nub > hid-p <dig> discs, co-expression of hid and p <dig> induces tissue overgrowth, increased ccasp <dig> labeling, and ectopic wg expression . similar to eye discs, expression of datg1
rnai largely blocks tissue overgrowth and ectopic wg, but not the ccasp <dig> labeling . a low level of ectopic wg remains in nub > hid-p35-datg1
rnai discs .  quantification of ccasp <dig> labeling intensity in eye and wing discs . datg <dig> rnai has no obvious effects on the ccasp <dig> labeling induced by expression of hid and p <dig> in both eye  and wing  discs



we also characterized the involvement of datg <dig> in aip in undead wing imaginal discs. expression of hid and p <dig> under nub-gal <dig> control  causes strong overgrowth of the wing imaginal disc compared to nub > p <dig> control discs . datg <dig> rnai suppresses the overgrowth of nub > hid-p <dig> wing discs, but leaves ccasp <dig> activity intact . to further confirm these data obtained by rnai, we conducted mosaic analysis using datg <dig> null mutants in wing imaginal discs because homozygous datg <dig> mutants are early larval lethal in the ey > hid-p <dig> genetic background. consistent with rnai results, datg <dig> mutants do not alter ccasp <dig> labeling induced by co-expression of hid and p <dig> in marcm clones . similarly, datg <dig> mutant clones or rnai do not suppress gmr-hid-induced apoptosis in the eye . together, these data further confirm that loss of datg <dig> does not affect apoptosis and that datg <dig> controls aip downstream of caspase  activation.

datg <dig> is required for aip downstream of jnk, but upstream of wingless in undead eye and wing imaginal discs
next, because jnk is an important mediator of aip  <cit> , we determined the position of datg <dig> relative to jnk in the aip pathway. the jnk activity reporter puc-lacz is strongly induced in aip models compared to controls   <cit> . the morphology of the discs is severely disrupted, which correlates with signal intensity of puc-lacz, especially in overgrown areas. in response to datg <dig> rnai, overgrowth and disc morphology, as judged by elav labeling, is restored to almost normal . nevertheless, despite the rescue of disc morphology, puc-lacz expression is not significantly reduced . these data suggest that datg <dig> acts downstream of or in parallel to jnk activity in the aip pathway.

finally, we determined the position of datg <dig> relative to wingless , another marker in the aip pathway . wg and its orthologs are critical mediators of aip in regenerative responses in many animals . in undead eye discs, inappropriate wg expression is induced compared to controls . datg <dig> knockdown normalizes wg expression in the disc . in addition, in undead nub > hid-p <dig> wing imaginal discs, wg expression is strongly induced . however, similar to undead eye discs, co-expression of datg <dig> rnai in nub > hid-p <dig> discs suppresses overgrowth  and normalizes the wg pattern . together, these analyses suggest that datg <dig> acts genetically downstream of dronc and either downstream of or in parallel to jnk, but upstream of wg, in the aip network.

in addition to the rnai analysis, we also co-expressed hid and p <dig> in either wildtype, dronc, or datg <dig> mutant clones  and examined for jnk activity  and wg expression . ectopic wg expression is most frequently observed in the wing pouch area in close proximity to the dorsoventral boundary in the wing disc , similar to previous reports  <cit> . the induction of mmp <dig> and wg expression is dependent on dronc as co-expression of hid and p <dig> in dronc mutant clones suppresses these aip markers . importantly, when hid and p <dig> were co-expressed in datg <dig> mutant clones, the expression of wg was suppressed, while mmp <dig> expression was not affected  suggesting that datg <dig> acts downstream of or in parallel to jnk activity, but upstream of wg. these data are consistent with the rnai data .fig.  <dig> 
datg <dig> is required cell autonomously for wg expression, but not jnk activation, in undead clones. late third instar wing discs with mosaic clones positively marked by gfp, anterior is to the left. mmp <dig> labeling  is used as marker of jnk activity. wg  is highly expressed at the dorsal/ventral  boundaries  of wing discs.  simultaneous expression of hid and p <dig> in clones. mmp <dig> expression  is induced in all hid and p <dig> co-expressing clones. ectopic expression of wg  was observed in over 80 % of clones  generated in close proximity to the d/v boundaries in the wing discs. genotype: hs-flp tub-gal <dig> uas-gfp/uas-hid; uas-p35/+; tub-gal <dig> frt80b/frt80b.  simultaneous expression of hid and p <dig> in dronc mutant clones. both mmp <dig> labeling and ectopic wg expression, induced by co-expression of hid and p <dig>  are completed blocked in dronc mutant clones . genotype: hs-flp tub-gal <dig> uas-gfp/uas-hid; uas-p35/+; tub-gal <dig> frt80b/dronci <dig> frt80b.  simultaneous expression of hid and p <dig> in datg <dig> mutant clones. hid and p35-induced mmp <dig> expression persists in datg <dig> mutant clones . in contrast, the ectopic wg expression induced by hid and p <dig> is suppressed in over 70 % of datg <dig> clones  generated in close proximity to the d/v boundaries in the wing discs. genotype: hs-flp tub-gal <dig> uas-gfp/uas-hid; uas-p35/+; tub-gal <dig> frt80b/datg1

because datg <dig> is required for wg expression in aip, we tested if datg <dig> was also sufficient for expression of aip markers including wg, dpp, and kekkon <dig> , the latter being a marker of egfr activity . however, while expression of hid in the dets > hid model is sufficient to induce wg, dpp, and kek expression , expression of datg <dig> alone under the same conditions  is not . these observations suggest that, in addition to datg <dig> expression, additional caspase-dependent events have to occur in order to induce aip.

datg <dig> is transcriptionally induced for aip in a jnk-dependent manner
next, we examined if protein and transcript levels of datg <dig> change in aip. indeed, using a datg1-specific antibody   <cit> , we observed increased protein abundance of datg <dig> in the undead compartment of wing discs compared to controls . to determine if this is a transcriptional or translational effect on datg <dig> levels in undead cells, we performed mrna in situ hybridization assays on undead  and regenerative  wing imaginal discs. in both aip models, datg <dig> is transcriptionally induced . additional file 5: figure s <dig> demonstrates the specificity of the datg <dig> in situ probes. the hhts > hid regenerative model allows determination of the timing of datg <dig> expression during aip. datg <dig> expression is slow as a pulse of hid expression for 15 h only weakly induces it . only after prolonged expression of hid , is a strong induction of datg <dig> expression detectable . these data suggest that datg <dig> expression occurs quite late in the aip response.fig.  <dig> 
datg <dig> is transcriptionally induced for aip in a jnk-dependent manner. late third instar wing discs, anterior is to the left. white dotted lines indicate the anterior/posterior compartment boundaries. hh-gal <dig> is used to drive expression of various transgenes in the posterior compartment of wing discs.  wing discs are labeled with datg <dig> . gfp marks the posterior disc compartment where hh-gal <dig> is expressed . compared to hh > p <dig> controls , co-expression of hid and p <dig> by hh > gal <dig> induces overgrowth of the posterior wing compartment as indicated by enlarged tissue size and folded disc morphology . datg <dig> protein is strongly increased in the overgrown posterior tissue . knockdown of jnk  has no effect on datg <dig> expression in the control hh > p <dig> discs , but it suppresses overgrowth as well as accumulation of datg <dig> in hh > hid-p <dig> discs .  wing discs labeled with datg <dig> in situ antisense probes .  compared to the control , datg <dig> transcription, as indicated by the fluorescent in situ signals of datg <dig>  is increased in hh > hid-p <dig> discs .  hh-gal <dig> tub-gal80

ca . a weak increase of datg <dig> transcript was observed in the posterior wing tissues after a 15 h expression of hid . datg <dig> transcript is strongly increased after hid expression for 68 h . this increase of datg <dig> transcripts is inhibited by knockdown of jnk  with only a low level of datg <dig> induction left in hh

rnai discs . although expression of hid at 29 °c for 6 h followed by recovery at 18 °c for 6 h  does not trigger accumulation of datg <dig> , expression of hep
ca  under the same condition is sufficient to induce expression of datg <dig> 



because datg <dig> acts genetically downstream of or in parallel to jnk  and because jnk can induce datg <dig> expression under oxidative stress conditions and by ectopic activation of jnk  <cit> , we tested if the transcriptional induction of datg <dig> in the aip models is also dependent on jnk. the drosophila jnk homolog is encoded by the gene basket   <cit> . indeed, while bsk rnai does not affect datg <dig> expression in control discs , it suppresses the accumulation of datg <dig> protein in undead and datg <dig> transcripts in regenerative wing discs . consistent with a previous report  <cit> , ectopic jnk activation by expression of a constitutively active jnkk transgene  for a short pulse of 6 h with 6 h recovery at 18 °c  is sufficient to induce datg <dig> expression in wing imaginal discs . however, expression of the pro-apoptotic gene hid under the same conditions  cannot induce datg <dig> expression . combined, these data suggest that datg <dig> expression is under direct control of jnk signaling, while it is far downstream of hid expression.

undead tissue produces autophagosome-like particles which do not contribute to apoptosis-induced proliferation
datg <dig> acts upstream in the autophagy pathway and its activation can induce autophagy  <cit> . oxidative stress or ectopic activation of jnk has been previously reported to induce expression of multiple datg genes, including datg <dig>  as well as autophagy in midgut and fat body cells  <cit> . we therefore examined if autophagy is induced in undead disc tissue and whether it contributes to aip. because datg <dig> is an essential part of autophagosomes, fusion proteins of datg <dig> with fluorescent proteins such as gfp or mcherry are used as markers for formation of autophagosomes  <cit> . moreover, because gfp is stable in autophagosomes, but unstable in autolysosomes, whereas mcherry is stable in both compartments, the tandem fusion protein gfp-mcherry-datg8a is used as marker for the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, indicating autophagic flux  <cit> . indeed, as shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  undead ey > hid-p35-expressing tissue accumulates large quantities of gfp-mcherry-datg8a-containing particles. however, it is unclear if these particles are classical autophagosomes. while the gfp signals are weaker compared to the mcherry signals, which may be an indicator of autophagic flux, there are clearly gfp-only particles which do not display mcherry fluorescence . this observation is inconsistent with the concept of autophagic flux  <cit> . furthermore, even though datg <dig> rnai suppresses aip, it does not suppress the formation of the gfp-mcherry-datg8a particles . this result suggests that the ectopic expression of datg <dig> in undead tissue does not induce the formation of the gfp-mcherry-datg8a-containing particles. furthermore, and more importantly, these particles do not contribute to the overgrowth of undead tissue nor, thus, to aip.

other datg genes mediating autophagy and unc- <dig> are not required for apoptosis-induced proliferation
because of this unexpected result, we tested other datg genes for an involvement in aip. surprisingly, rnai targeting datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg8a, datg8b, datg <dig>  and datg <dig> as well as vps <dig> and vps <dig> had no effect on aip . most notable are datg <dig> and datg <dig> because they encode essential components for autophagosome maturation  . to ensure that the rnai transgenes used to target these datg genes are functionally intact, we tested them in two functional assays. they suppressed starvation-induced autophagy in the fat body  demonstrating that datg <dig>  datg8a, and datg8b are efficiently knocked down to induce an autophagy-deficient phenotype. in addition, the functionality of these rnai stocks is further confirmed in that they all enhanced the eyeful phenotype  which is known to be enhanced by loss of autophagy  <cit> . the eyeful   <cit>  condition uses the same gal <dig> driver as in the ey > hid-p <dig> aip model. therefore, tissue-specific and/or gal4-dependent differences do not account for the failure of these rnai stocks to suppress aip.fig.  <dig> key components of the autophagy pathway, other than datg <dig>  do not modify the ey > hid-p <dig> phenotype.  results of the suppression of ey > hid-p <dig> using rnai targeting components of the autophagy pathway in drosophila. representative rnai results for each gene were shown. compared to the control where no rnai was used, knockdown of datg <dig> significantly increases the percentage of weak phenotype or wildtype-like ey > hid-p <dig> flies to about 80 %. however, knockdown of datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg8a, datg8b, datg <dig>  datg <dig>  vps <dig>  and vps <dig> does not suppress the ey > hid-p <dig> overgrowth phenotype. in contrast, expression of a kinase dead form of tor  or knockdown of raptor, both of which cause activation of datg <dig>  enhances the aip phenotype. however, rnai targeting unc- <dig>  which mediates the function of datg <dig> in neuronal development, does not suppress the overgrowth of ey > hid-p <dig> flies. room temperature  was used in some cases due to strong lethality caused by expressing these rnai lines at 25 °c in the background of ey > hid-p <dig>  the ey > hid-p <dig> flies display comparable overgrowth phenotypes at 25 °c and rt.  late third instar eye discs labeled with ccasp <dig>  wg, and elav. neither datg <dig> null mutants   nor datg <dig> null mutants   inhibit overgrowth, ccasp <dig> labeling and ectopic wg expression  in ey > hid-p <dig> discs 



in addition to targeting essential autophagy components by rnai, we also tested homozygous datg <dig> and datg <dig> mutants which can survive to pupal or adult stages, respectively, for suppression of aip. datg <dig> encodes a component of the atg1/ulk protein complex, while datg <dig> encodes the e1-conjugating enzyme for autophagosome maturation. however, datg <dig> and datg <dig> mutants fail to suppress the abnormal morphology of ey > hid-p <dig> discs as visualized by elav labeling and the ectopic wg expression . these results suggest that the tested datg genes, except datg <dig>  are not required for aip. an involvement of datg <dig> in aip is further confirmed by expression of a kinase dead form of tor   <cit> , which activates datg <dig>  <cit> , or rnai knockdown of raptor, an adaptor protein required for tor activation  <cit> , both of which enhance aip .

finally, we also examined the possibility that datg <dig> uses the same mechanism in aip that it uses during neuronal development. however, rnai targeting unc- <dig>  which is an important mediator of the function of datg <dig> during neuronal development  <cit> , does not suppress the overgrowth phenotype of the undead ey > hid-p <dig> aip model . three independent rnai lines gave consistent results. therefore, in addition to autophagy and neuronal development, our data define a third function of datg <dig> for aip.

discussion
in this paper, we show that the sole ulk ortholog in drosophila, datg <dig>  is required for aip both in undead and regenerative models. we demonstrated that datg <dig> acts downstream of jnk activity in aip and is transcriptionally induced by jnk, consistent with a previous study on oxidation response  <cit> . furthermore, datg <dig> is required for the expression of wg, a mitogen associated with aip . finally, our data provide evidence that the role of datg <dig> in aip is independent on its role in canonical autophagy.

it is generally assumed that the secreted mitogens wg, dpp, and spitz promote the proliferation of surviving cells during aip  <cit> . the expression of these genes is under control of jnk activity. until recently, it was unknown how jnk signaling promotes expression of these genes. however, very recently, it was reported that an enhancer element in the wg gene that drives expression of wg under regenerative conditions contains three ap- <dig> binding sites required for regeneration  <cit> . ap- <dig> is composed of the transcription factors jun and fos , which are controlled by jnk activity. this observation suggests a direct way of wg expression by jnk-dependent ap- <dig> 

how does datg <dig> fit into the aip network? our genetic data suggest that datg <dig> acts downstream of or in parallel to jnk. furthermore, we placed datg <dig> genetically upstream of wg expression. therefore, datg <dig> may act in at least two different ways in the aip network. it may directly modulate the activity of the ap- <dig> transcriptional complex. an indirect mode of action is also possible in which datg <dig> provides a permissive environment for ap- <dig> activity. however, datg <dig> does not control all ap- <dig> activities. expression of puc-lacz and mmp- <dig> are not affected by datg1rnai and datg <dig> mutants, respectively . in contrast, wg expression is suppressed under these conditions. therefore, of the known transcriptional targets of jnk and ap- <dig> during aip , datg <dig> affects only wg expression. future work will address the mechanistic role of datg <dig> for the control of aip.

although datg <dig> is required for aip, it is not sufficient. overexpression of datg <dig> using dets-gal <dig> for 12 h followed by 24 h recovery does not trigger aip markers such as wg-lacz, dpp-lacz, or kek-lacz . expression of hid under the same conditions is able to induce these markers ectopically. these observations suggest that, in addition to datg <dig> expression, apoptotic signaling triggers an additional activity required for wg expression and aip.

the best characterized function of datg <dig> and of ulks in general is the initiation of autophagy under starvation or stress conditions  <cit> . autophagy requires a total of  <dig> atg genes  <cit> . although we did not test all  <dig> datg genes for a role in aip, we tested several genes which are critical for autophagy, including datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg <dig>  datg <dig>  and vps <dig>  datg <dig> and datg <dig>  encode subunits of the atg1/ulk complex . atg <dig> and vps <dig> are subunits of the atg6/beclin complex, which is activated by atg <dig> during autophagy. phosphorylation of atg <dig>  the mammalian ortholog of datg <dig>  by ulk <dig> is required for autophagy  <cit> . finally, lipidation of atg <dig>  which is essential for formation of autophagosomes requires the function of atg <dig> and atg <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to datg <dig>  inactivation of any of these genes does not suppress the overgrowth phenotype of ey > hid-p <dig> animals. furthermore, although we detect the formation of atg8a-containing particles in undead eye imaginal discs, these particles are not dependent on datg <dig> and do not contribute to aip and overgrowth . combined, these data suggest that datg <dig> does not trigger canonical autophagy in an aip context.

in addition to autophagy, ulk proteins have also been implicated in neuronal development, most notably axon guidance and axonal growth  <cit> . however, we also exclude a neuronal function of datg <dig> in aip because inactivation of unc- <dig>  a mediator of datg <dig> for neuronal development  <cit> , does not suppress overgrowth induced by ey > hid-p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we revealed a third function of datg <dig> in drosophila for the control of regenerative proliferation after massive apoptotic cell loss. future work will address if this role of datg <dig> in regenerative proliferation is also conserved in other organisms, the molecular mechanism of this function, and whether it is potentially misregulated in pathological conditions such as cancer.
