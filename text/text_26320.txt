BACKGROUND
the chemokine system has been shown to play a crucial role in both homeostasis, for example in lymphoid organogenesis and leukocyte maturation  <cit> , and disease mechanisms. the system is complex and relies on the chemokine ligand binding to its chemokine receptor, with additional complexity arising from the fact that multiple chemokines can bind a single receptor and vice versa. the distinction between roles in homoeostasis and disease has been used as a means of functionally classifying both chemokines and chemokine receptors, although several chemokines have both homeostatic and inflammatory functions  <cit> . inflammatory chemokines and their receptors have been demonstrated to have a role in the immune response to a myriad of pathogens both in humans and in other species. homeostatic chemokines are generally constitutively expressed whereas the inflammatory chemokines are up-regulated following stimulation of the cell, for instance by cytokines or pathogens. it has recently been demonstrated that many of the inflammatory chemokines and their receptors exist in clustered groups in the mammalian genome and it is thought that these clustered chemokines have evolved relatively recently in evolutionary terms  <cit> . these inflammatory, clustered chemokines also tend to share functional properties, for example the cxcl chemokines, previously named gro chemokines, are all capable of attracting neutrophils. this provides the chemokine system with an inherent robustness whereby the impairment of function in one chemokine can be overcome through the deployment of a second chemokine with similar properties, a capability aided by the inherent promiscuity of the chemokine system.

both the chemokines and their receptors are grouped into four families, cc, cxc, xc and cx3c chemokines, depending on the location of c terminal cysteine residues in the chemokines with the receptors classified based on the chemokine family they bind. the chemokine receptors are g protein-coupled receptors with a conserved seven hydrophobic transmembrane structure and an extracellular n-terminus and intracellular c-terminus. the c-terminus is known to be involved in signalling following binding of the ligand, however there seems to be no consistent ligand binding mechanism. the chemokines studied to date use various combinations of the n-terminus and different extracellular loops of the transmembrane complex in order to bind the receptor  <cit> .

in humans the chemokine receptor system has been well characterised. there are currently  <dig> known human chemokine receptors; ccr1- <dig>  cxcr1- <dig>  xcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  <cit>  as well as other related receptors which bind chemokines but act as decoy receptors  <cit> . the availability of the bovine genome  <cit>  has made it possible to begin to unravel the bovine chemokine and receptor system, however there are still areas of the genome which are yet to be properly assembled and at present many of the bovine homologs to the chemokine receptors are based on predictions from the genome sequence with no supporting experimental evidence. experimentally confirmed sequences for bovine chemokine receptors are currently available in the public databases for ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , cxcr <dig> , cxcr <dig> , cxcr <dig> , cxcr <dig> , cxcr <dig>  and cxcr <dig> . cattle may also have at least one chemokine receptor not present in the human genome; c-c chemokine receptor type 1-like .

in the case of the inflammatory chemokine receptors, differences between cattle and human receptor repertoires may have significant effects on the immune response. following sequencing of the bovine genome, several key differences between the human and bovine immunome became apparent  <cit> . firstly a newly discovered set of interferon  genes were identified which have been provisionally called the ifnx genes. cattle also seem to have more ifn genes generally than other species, for example cattle have multiple copies of ifnβ and ifnΩ  <cit> . ruminants are also known to possess a unique ifnt family which are thought to have a role in pregnancy  <cit> . these differences between ruminants and other species may be due to major physiological differences in tissues such as the gut. the presence of increased numbers of microorganisms within the gut of ruminants renders them more susceptible to opportunistic infection. cattle and other ruminants may therefore have evolved a more complex immune system to deal with the increased threat both from a physiological standpoint and due to the herd structure of these animals' populations which increase the risk of animal to animal transmission.

we present here a comprehensive investigation of the bovine chemokine receptor repertoire and their mrna abundance by mononuclear phagocytes; macrophages , dendritic cells  and their precursors the monocytes . these cells are crucial players in the immune response to various pathogens and the chemokine receptors expressed by these cells will determine their chemotactic migration within an animal. we also report analysis of a chemokine receptor, ccr1l, which may be unique to cattle.

methods
identification of chemokine receptor genes in the bovine genome
the current bovine genome assembly btau_ <dig>  available at the ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org was screened for bovine homologs to the  <dig> known human chemokine receptors using blast. we also screened available bovine sequences in the ncbi database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for homologous sequences. the ensembl browser was used as the basis for the examination of synteny and for gene structure prediction.

confirmation of bovine chemokine receptor cdna sequences
as many of the currently identified bovine chemokine receptor sequences are predicted from the genome we set out to confirm their full length coding sequences . all receptors were amplified from cdna produced from rna extracted from holstein friesian cattle; ccr <dig>  ccr1l, ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> were isolated from lysed whole blood cells, ccr <dig> from blood-derived dc, ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> from blood-derived b-cells, ccr <dig> and cx3cr <dig> from blood-derived mo, ccr <dig> from a spleen tissue sample, cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> from a blood-derived granulocyte/mo preparation and cxcr <dig> and xcr <dig> from a lymph node tissue sample. blood-derived cells; lysed whole blood cells, mo, dc and mo/granulocytes were isolated as described previously  <cit> , with the exception that dc were cultured for seven days with a media change after three days. for isolation of b-cells, pbmc were prepared from blood  <cit> , then b-cells were isolated using the monoclonal antibody cc <dig>  recognising the surface antigen cd <dig>  <cit> , and anti-mouse igg2a+b microbeads . rna was isolated by lysing cells with  <dig> m guanidine thiocyanate followed by rna extraction using the rneasy mini kit . tissue samples were processed for rna extraction as described previously  <cit> . the quality and quantity of the rna were assessed using the ultrospec  <dig> pro spectrophotometer . cdna was prepared using superscript ii, superscript iii  or revertaid h minus  reverse transcriptases.

pcr amplification of full-length cds of chemokine receptors was carried out using gotaq dna polymerase , taq dna polymerase  or the expand high fidelityplus pcr system . primers used for amplification are shown in additional file 1; supplemental table s <dig>  pcr products were then cloned into ta cloning vectors; pcr <dig> -topo , pgem-t easy  or pdrive . sequencing of inserts was performed using the using bigdye <dig> terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit  on an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyser . primers used for sequencing are shown in additional file 1; supplemental table s <dig>  sequence analysis was performed using the sequenchertm package version  <dig> . <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis of identified bovine chemokine receptors
the amino acid sequences of identified bovine chemokine receptors and available full length homologous sequences from humans, sheep, pigs and horse were aligned using clustalw  <cit> , and a phylogenetic tree constructed using phylip  <cit> . evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum parsimony  method, the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  are shown next to the branches.

real-time pcr evaluation of bovine chemokine receptor mrna abundance in mononuclear phagocytes
quantitative real-time pcr on triplicate samples was carried out using taqman fast universal pcr mastermix  on an abi prism  <dig> fast real-time pcr system  using  <dig> ng cdna as the starting template. primers and probes used for real-time pcr analysis of ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and gapdh have previously been reported  <cit> . primers and probes for the other bovine chemokine receptors are given in additional file 1; supplemental table s <dig>  amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95°c for  <dig> seconds, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> seconds and 60°c for  <dig> seconds. the transcript copy number for a given gene was calculated by comparison with plasmid standard curves containing known copy numbers of target genes. relative mrna abundance values were then calculated according to the 'relative quantitation of gene expression experimental design and analysis: relative standard curve method' . for each target gene, mrna abundance levels were normalised to the housekeeping gene gapdh according to the formula .

statistical analysis of quantitative real-time pcr data
analysis of data was carried out using microsoft® excel  <dig>  and graphpad prism  <dig>  for windows . differences between groups were determined by repeated measures one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey's multiple comparison tests.

RESULTS
characterisation of bovine homologs to human chemokine receptors
in the human system, ten ccr receptors , six cxcr receptors  and the unique xcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig> receptors have been characterised. we were able to identify bovine homologs to all of these receptors by bioinformatic analyses of available bovine sequences and genome databases. we set out to confirm identified genes by amplification of transcripts from bovine mrna. for the ccr- chemokine receptors, sequences for ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> have all been published however the other ccr-receptor sequences are only predicted from the genome. for the published ccr-chemokine receptor sequences we were able to confirm the sequence data available, although some synonymous differences were detected, likely due to breed-specific differences. we did however, detect six amino acid differences in ccr <dig> compared to the published sequence  . these were located in the transmembrane regions and the extracellular carboxy- and intracellular amino-termini of the protein and may also reflect breed-specific differences as the available sequence data comes from a hereford animal whilst our data is from a holstein friesian animal. whether these amino acid changes would confer functional differences in the ccr <dig> receptor remains to be determined. our sequence for ccr <dig> has been submitted to genbank .

we also confirmed coding sequences for the ccr-chemokine receptors that are currently only available as predicted sequences; ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  these have also been submitted to genbank . we detected synonymous nucleotide changes in ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> compared to the published sequences. ccr <dig> has two transcript variants in the ncbi database  and one truncated transcript in the ensembl database . the ccr <dig> sequence we amplified  is identical to transcript variant  <dig>  ccr <dig> has one transcript variant in the ncbi database  and three in the ensembl database . the sequence we identified  was very similar to the ncbi transcript except for one amino acid change located in the second extracellular loop. our ccr <dig> sequence  is identical at the amino acid level to the predicted sequence  however minor differences exist at the nucleotide level.

sequences for cxcr1- <dig> have previously been published. the sequences we detected mostly had synonymous differences compared to those published except for cxcr <dig>  which had three amino acid changes compared to the published sequence ; one in the extracellular amino-terminus, one in the second extracellular loop and one in the intracellular carboxy-terminus. there are multiple sequences available for cxcr <dig> in the ncbi database , and one in the ensembl database  which is identical at the amino acid level to np_ <dig> although synonymous nucleotide differences are present between the two sequences. all three sequences deposited in the ncbi database differ at the amino acid level and our sequence  is also different from these. the sequences deposited in genbank are all from pooled samples which may account for the sequence differences seen. the sequence for xcr <dig> is currently only predicted from the database . we amplified an xcr <dig> transcript  which has one amino acid change, compared to the predicted sequence, in the second intracellular loop. experimentally confirmed sequence has been published for cx3cr <dig>  but this is from a hereford animal. our sequence  differed from the published sequence by three amino acids, located in the extracellular amino-terminus, the second transmembrane domain and the fourth transmembrane domain. these are likely to be breed-specific differences.

when compared to chemokine receptor sequences from humans and more related species  the bovine receptors generally group well with their homologs indicating a common evolutionary history for most of the chemokine receptors. a significant exception comes in the form of the two cxcl <dig> receptors, cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  phylogenetic analysis reveals that for the bovine and equine cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> sequences, the two sequences are more closely related at the intraspecies level than to their designated homologs in other species . as has been reported previously, this is due to bovine cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> having identical carboxy-termini, whereas in humans this intracellular domain differs between the two receptors  <cit> .

characterisation of ccr1l, a chemokine receptor potentially unique to cattle
during our search for bovine homologs of human chemokine receptors we identified an additional chemokine receptor that was not present in humans. this receptor was previously designated c-c chemokine receptor type 1-like , henceforth abbreviated to ccr1l. ccr1l is located adjacent to ccr <dig> in the bovine genome and is most closely related to ccr <dig> when compared to all bovine chemokine receptors , potentially representing a gene-duplication event in cattle. smart analysis  <cit>  revealed the existence of seven transmembrane domains, common to all chemokine receptors. we also identified the characteristic dry motif, located in the second intracellular loop, which is required for activation  <cit> . by predicting the membrane topology of ccr1l and mapping the amino acid differences onto this topology  it becomes apparent that the extracellular amino-termini of ccr1l and ccr <dig> are identical, however the rest of the protein, particularly the intracellular loops and the intracellular carboxy-termini are markedly different. there are four cysteine residues present in ccr <dig> which have important roles in maintaining conformation, ligand binding, signalling and trafficking of chemokine receptors to the cell membrane  <cit> . in addition to these conserved cysteines between ccr <dig> and ccr1l in cattle, ccr1l has an additional cysteine in the third extracellular loop and an additional pair of cysteines in the intracellular tail . homologs to ccr1l are not present in the available ensembl pig or horse genome assemblies and preliminary attempts to detect ccr1l in water buffalo, sheep and goats were unsuccessful . it is therefore possible that ccr1l represents a chemokine receptor unique to cattle, however further investigations are required to confirm this.

chemokine receptor expression by bovine mononuclear phagocytic cells
as little is known about the expression levels of bovine chemokine receptors we set out to determine mrna abundance in a group of cells important in the immune response, the mononuclear phagocytes. these cells, which include the mφ, dc and their precursor cell the mo, are thought to express chemokine receptors during both homeostasis and disease as a means of targeting to sites of infection. real-time pcr assays were developed in order to measure the mrna abundance of all identified bovine chemokine receptors in the three cell types isolated from five animals. mrna abundance levels of the ccr-receptors were quite variable with some receptors, such as ccr <dig>  being expressed at high levels when compared to others such as ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> . no ccr <dig> mrna was detected for any of the mononuclear phagocytes, however mrna was detected for other bovine immune cells . some ccr receptors, ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  were not expressed differently between the cell types, whilst others showed cell-specific levels of mrna abundance. mrna abundance of the cxcr-, xcr- and cx3cr-receptors also showed considerable variability with cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig> showing variability between the three cell types . considering the receptors as a whole, differentiation of mo to mφ resulted in an increase in mrna abundance for ccr <dig> and a decrease in ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  dc also showed higher levels of ccr <dig> mrna abundance than mo and lower levels of ccr1l, ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  comparing mφ and dc, mφ demonstrated higher abundance of ccr1l, ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig> 

discussion
the chemokine receptors are thought to have originated from a single ancestral gene with individual genes arising due to subsequent gene duplication events  <cit> . many of the chemokine receptors are clustered across the genome and these proximal chemokine receptors also tend to be closely related. generally the chemokine receptor family is well conserved between mammalian species, as can be seen by a comparison of the well-studied human and murine chemokine receptor genes, however some differences do exist indicating ongoing evolution of the chemokine receptor system. here for the first time, we have characterised the full complement of bovine homologs to known human chemokine receptors and in doing so have also further characterised an additional chemokine receptor not found in humans. generally the bovine chemokine receptors showed high homology to their human counterparts and chromosomal organisation was well conserved. however, differences were identified when comparing the bovine and human chemokine receptors. as reported previously, the bovine cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> display a higher degree of homology to each other than the human receptors, due to the lack in cattle of a differing carboxy-terminal in cattle as is found in humans  <cit> . despite this, the two bovine receptors seem to have similar functional properties to the human receptors. without further study the functional relatedness of the complete complement of human and bovine chemokine receptors cannot be assumed however the high degree of sequence similarity between the receptors suggests many properties may be shared between species. as expected, there was also a high degree of similarity between the chemokine receptors of cattle and those from other ruminants and members of the cetartiodactyla, although limited sequence data are available for these species. there is a significant difference between the xcr <dig> gene of pigs, cattle and humans in that much of the 5' un-translated region of porcine xcr <dig> is shared with the first exon of ccr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, horses have an extra ccr-chemokine receptor that seems to have formed as a result of recombination between ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  <cit> .

one major difference between the bovine and human chemokine receptor repertoire is in the presence of an additional ccr-chemokine receptor, c-c chemokine receptor type 1-like, here called ccr1l. this receptor is located adjacent to ccr <dig> in the bovine genome and may have arisen as a result of a gene duplication event as indicated by phylogenetic analysis. ccr1l is not present in the genome sequences of humans, horses or pigs and so this may represent a relatively recent evolutionary event, however whether ccr1l is unique to cattle is at present unknown. bovine ccr <dig> and ccr1l share identical amino-termini however the remainder of the sequence differs and overall the two sequences share only 78% nucleotide identity , 66% amino acid identity and 73% similarity. whether the ccr1l receptor is functional is not yet clear, however the gene is transcribed and analysis of transcriptional levels in mononuclear phagocytes revealed that ccr1l is also transcribed differently to ccr <dig> in these cells. ccr1l also possesses a number of features characteristic of functional chemokine receptors including the dry motif, which is lacking in the non-signalling receptors d <dig> and darc  <cit> , and the npxxy motif in transmembrane region  <dig> which is thought to be important for g protein-coupled receptor activation  <cit> . we also identified cysteines in the extracellular loops of ccr1l which are critical for normal chemokine receptor function  <cit> . unusually, ccr1l has two cysteine residues in the third extracellular loop. the additional cysteine in the third extracellular loop may bind to the extracellular amino-terminus as cysteines in this region are known to form disulphide bridges with the amino-terminus  <cit> . however without further study the functional significance of these two cysteine residues in the third extra-cellular loop is unknown. although not present in ccr <dig>  most other chemokine receptors also have cysteine residues in their carboxy-termini. these cysteines, normally located 12- <dig> amino acids from the transmembrane region as found for ccr1l, are suggested to be palmitoylated, particularly when surrounded by clusters of amino acids that are hydrophobic and positively charged as for ccr1l  <cit> . these cysteines effectively anchor the intracellular carboxy-terminus to the plasma membrane and hence create a fourth intracellular loop . for ccr <dig> it is has been shown that palmitoylation is essential for transport to the plasma membrane and for downstream signalling activation and may also be required for phosphorylation of the receptor  <cit> .

at present the ligands, if any, for ccr1l are unknown however we can begin to speculate about possible ligands based on sequence similarity at the important binding regions of the chemokine receptors. the amino termini of ccr <dig> and ccr1l in cattle are identical and it has been shown by chimera studies that this domain in human ccr <dig> confers a degree of ligand specificity  <cit>  thus it could be speculated that ccr <dig> and ccr1l bind the same ligands. however, full activation of ccr <dig> seems to require additional sites, in particular ccl <dig> has been shown to interact with ccr <dig> at the second extracellular domain. ccr1l and ccr <dig> differ considerably in this region suggesting that there may be differences in ligand binding between the two receptors. without further study it is impossible to know exactly which ligands bind ccr1l, however given the restriction of ccr1l to cattle and possibly other related species it is interesting to note that cattle have a unique cc-chemokine, regakine, which seems to synergise with cxcl <dig> to increase neutrophil migration but for which no receptor has currently been identified  <cit> . it is therefore possible that ccr1l and regakine represent a chemokine:receptor pairing that is absent from humans but present in cattle and potentially other ruminants. given the importance of chemokines in the immune response, the restriction of ccr1l and regakine to cattle may relate to the differing immune requirements of humans and cattle.

there are several papers reporting the chemokine receptor repertoire of mononuclear phagocytic cells and the changes in their expression during maturation from mo to antigen-presenting cells in humans. mo have been shown varyingly to express ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  <cit>  which aid in their dissemination from the bone marrow into the tissues. upon maturation to mφ, mo down-regulate ccr <dig> and increase expression of ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  <cit> . dc have been shown to express a range of chemokine receptors however the expression level depends on the maturation state of the cell. immature dc express a range of receptors for the inflammatory chemokines including ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> which guide the cell to sites of inflammation however maturation results in a down-regulation of many of these receptors and an up-regulation of receptors for constitutive chemokines such as ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  <cit> . this then allows the dc to traffic back to the lymph node in order to present antigen to t-cells. the down-regulation of ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> has been shown to be due to the release of chemokines by the dc, which ccr <dig> is resistant to  <cit> . many of the receptors may only be functional under certain conditions, for example mononuclear phagocytes have been shown only to respond to cxcl <dig> following appropriate cytokine stimulation  <cit> . in the bovine system we were only able to assess expression levels at the mrna level as no antibodies are currently available for bovine chemokine receptors. studies in humans have revealed that for some chemokine receptors functional receptor levels are reflected at the mrna level, for example the down-regulation of ccr <dig> and the up-regulation of ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> during the maturation of mo to mφ  <cit> . however for other chemokine receptors, such as the observed down-regulation in ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> by maturing dc, this was shown to be due to the redistribution of the receptor to an endocytic compartment rather than an actual change in total protein levels  <cit> . despite our inability to measure protein levels, the mrna abundance levels provide a useful insight into the chemokine receptor repertoire of bovine cells. at the mrna level we were able to confirm the down-regulation of ccr <dig> and up-regulation of ccr <dig> seen in human cells upon maturation of mo to mφ, and in addition demonstrated the down-regulation in transcription of cxcr <dig> and cx3cr <dig>  for dc we were only able to detect higher levels of ccr <dig> compared to mo but demonstrated the down-regulation of a number of receptors including ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> which have been shown to be down-regulated upon maturation of human dc.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we present here for the first time a complete characterisation of the bovine chemokine receptor system. the bovine system shows many similarities to the well-characterised human and murine systems, with a couple of exceptions. firstly, as reported previously, the cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> of cattle are much more closely related than those of humans and so may exhibit functional differences to the human receptors. secondly, cattle possess the gene for an additional chemokine receptor not present in humans. this receptor shows some homology to ccr <dig> but possesses some amino acid differences that could result in the receptor differing in ligand binding or signalling to ccr <dig>  we have also determined the mrna abundance of all identified bovine chemokine receptors in mononuclear phagocytic cells and demonstrated similar trends in chemokine receptor repertoire to those in humans. the availability of chemokine receptor sequences will hopefully fuel the production of antibodies to these important immune modulators and allow more extensive characterisation of the bovine chemokine system. further study of species-restricted chemokines and receptors may also reveal a facet of the chemokine system that is unique to cattle and other closely related species.
