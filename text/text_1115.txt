BACKGROUND
brassinosteroids  are a family of steroid hormones that regulate cell division and cell elongation in plants and participate in the control of growth and development  <cit> . brs are synthesized from the sterol campesterol, which is modified by a cascade of hydroxylation and oxidation reactions to yield the biologically active brs castasterone  and brassinolide   <cit> . cs and bl bioactivity is conferred by their ability to bind to the br-receptor bri <dig>  <cit> , which initiates a phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction cascade leading to nuclear acquisition of transcription factors that regulate the expression of br-responsive genes  <cit> .

whereas the last decade has seen rapid progress in the identification and characterization of factors, which control br biosynthesis and participate in br signal transduction, fewer advances were made in identifying proteins, which directly regulate br cellular homeostasis. different homeostatic mechanisms are thought to operate to maintain a br equilibrium, including the feedback inhibition of br production  <cit> . in addition, catabolic inactivation is also considered to play a role in the regulation of bioactive br levels  <cit> . cs and bl are catabolically altered or conjugated, with some modifications yielding inactive products. hydroxylation is one means of catabolic inactivation and is catalyzed by the arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase bas <dig>  <cit> . another class of br conjugates, which are inactive, are glucosides. cs and bl were found to be glucosylated at different positions in feeding studies, with species-specific variations in br-glucoside profiles  <cit> . in a. thaliana the hydroxyl groups c- <dig> and c- <dig> of cs and bl were identified as target sites for an attachment of glucose  <cit> . whilst enzymes mediating c- <dig> glucosylation of brs are still unknown, we could previously show that 23-o-glucosylation of cs and bl in a. thaliana is catalyzed by ugt73c <dig>  a udp-glycosyltransferase   <cit> . an increase in br-23-o-glucosylation activity in ugt73c <dig> over-expressing plants correlated with reduced levels of typhasterol , 6-deoxocastasterone  and cs and with br-deficient phenotypes, showing that 23-o-glucosylation reduces br bioactivity  <cit> .

ugts are glycosyltransferases  of family  <dig> in the cazy classification of carbohydrate-active enzymes  <cit>  and catalyze the transfer of glycosyl donor groups to small molecule acceptors, which include secondary metabolites, biotic and abiotic toxins and plant hormones  <cit> . ugts are regio- and stereo-selective, but are often capable in vitro of recognizing common features on multiple substrates  <cit> . moreover, from studies in the multigene family of ugts in a. thaliana, it has become clear that in vitro a single substrate may be accepted by many individuals of the family  <cit> . ugt73c <dig> has evolved from ugt subfamily 73c  <cit> , which consists of seven ugts, six of which are clustered in a tandem repeat, are highly similar in their sequences and are promiscuous in their substrate acceptance in vitro. for example, ugt73c <dig> has been reported as a flavonoid-7-o-glycosyltransferase  <cit>  and is in vitro also capable of conjugating hydroxycoumarins  <cit> , the isoflavone daidzein, the stilbene trans-resveratrol  <cit> , the xenobiotics hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene and aminodinitrotoluene  <cit> , as well as in yeast the fungal toxin zearalenone  <cit> . whereas activities of ugt73c subfamily members have been analyzed against various substrates in vitro  <cit>  the in planta substrate specificities and the physiological roles of these ugts are, with the exception of ugt73c <dig>  as yet little defined.

this study extends and completes the analysis of the ugt73c cluster in regard to the potential of its members to glucosylate brs and identifies ugt73c <dig> as a second ugt, which can accept brs as substrates in planta. it is shown that over-expression of ugt73c <dig> induces br-deficient phenotypes, whereas an over-expression of the ugts 73c <dig>  73c <dig>  73c <dig> and 73c <dig> does not cause such effects. br metabolite profiles and br glucosylation activity analyses provide evidence that ugt73c <dig> can catalyze cs and bl 23-o-glucosylation in planta. this work also introduces a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry  method, developed for the detection of br metabolites, and used as a tool to determine the kinetics of br-23-o-glucoside formation in wild type, ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants. the analysis uncovered the existence of novel br catabolites, which are considered to be br-malonylglucosides. lc-hrms of the kinetics of bl uptake and catabolism in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe lines as compared to wild type provided first indications that glucosylation protects bl from cellular removal.

RESULTS
over-expression of ugt73c <dig> results in br deficiency in a. thaliana
ugt73c <dig> is a member of ugt subfamily 73c, which is comprised of seven genes, six of which are clustered in a tandem repeat on chromosome  <dig> . the genes of the cluster are highly similar to each other, suggesting that they have evolved from a gene duplication from one ancestral gene and may therefore have related enzymatic properties  <cit> .

earlier work, which focused on ugt73c <dig>  had demonstrated that constitutive over-expression led to strong br-deficient phenotypes  <cit> . thus, it was of interest to investigate the phenotypic consequences of over-expressing other members of the ugt73c gene cluster.  <dig> to  <dig> independent transgenic lines expressing each of the ugts 73c <dig>  73c <dig>  73c <dig>  73c <dig> and 73c <dig> under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus  <dig> s  promoter were generated and analyzed for steady-state levels of transcripts using semi-quantitative rt-pcrs.  <dig> to  <dig> lines with high expression levels were then chosen for each ugt to assess effects on plant growth and development. whereas plants over-expressing the ugt73c <dig>  ugt73c <dig>  ugt73c <dig> and ugt73c <dig> did not show any obvious morphological phenotypes , an elevated expression of ugt73c <dig> resulted in drastic growth defects indicative for br deficiency. as shown in figure 1bugt73c <dig> over-expressing  plants were characterized by dark-green leaves with short petioles and a cabbage-like morphology, delayed flowering and senescence and reduced fertility; these phenotypes correlated in severity with the amounts of ugt73c <dig> transcript present.

to verify if the phenotypic indications for br deficiency were correlated with changes in endogenous br levels, br amounts were analyzed in aerial plant parts of a line with strong ugt73c <dig> expression  and compared to wild type by gc-ms in two independent biological experiments. the results are illustrated in figure 1c and show that concentrations of ty, 6-deoxocs and cs were reduced in ugt73c6oe plants. bl was below the limit of detection in both ugt73c6oe and wild type plants.

taken together these results show that over-expression of ugt73c <dig> induced phenotypes indicative of impaired br action in a. thaliana, which correlated with reduced levels of late pathway intermediates of br biosynthesis.

ugt73c <dig> catalyzes 23-o-glucosylation of cs and bl in planta
ugt73c <dig> has previously been characterized as a udp-glucose:flavonol-3-o-glycoside-7-o-glucosyltransferase, based on a decrease in quercetin-3-o-rhamnoside-7-o-glucoside accumulation in flowers of a ugt73c <dig> knock-out  line and a respective catalytic activity in vitro  <cit> . to investigate the possibility that ugt73c <dig>  in addition to its role in quercetin-3-o-rhamnoside glucosylation, can also catalyze br glucosylation in planta, it was anticipated to analyze br glucoside formation in plants altered in ugt73c <dig> expression. for this purpose a lc-hrms method was developed, which is outlined in the experimental procedures section. as reference standards cs-2-o-glucoside , cs-3-o-glucoside , cs-22-o-glucoside , cs-23-o-glucoside , bl-2-o-glucoside , bl-3-o-glucoside , bl-22-o-glucoside  and bl-23-o-glucoside  were used. the identification was based on retention times and mass spectra, by direct comparison of standards and metabolites. recovery rates for all measured analytes were between 83% and 93% , with a repeatability ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

preliminary experiments showed that, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , endogenous br glucosides were below the limit of detection in untreated plants, also with the newly developed lc-hrms method. thus br glucoside formation was investigated in plants treated with cs or bl. ten-day-old light-grown seedlings of wild type and ugt73c5oe plants, as well as ugt73c6oe and ugt73c6ko plants, were incubated in media containing either cs or bl for  <dig> hrs and metabolites formed were measured by lc-hrms. the results of the feeding studies showed that in plants over-expressing the ugt73c <dig>  in correspondence with plants over-expressing ugt73c <dig>  cs-23glc and bl-23glc formation was strongly increased  whereas cs-2glc and bl-2glc levels appeared unaltered . in seedlings of ugt73c6ko plants no statistically significant differences in br glucosylation activities to wild type were found. interestingly cs-23glc and bl-23glc were not only present in plant extracts, but were also detected in the media, in which the plants had been incubated for the feeding studies .

standard deviation of three independent biological experiments is shown.

therefore the results are consistent with the hypothesis that ugt73c <dig> can catalyze 23-o-glucosylation of cs and bl in planta.

ugt73c <dig> promoter gus activity is developmentally regulated
to analyze the promoter activity of ugt73c <dig> in different tissues and developmental stages a gus reporter lines was constructed in which the gus gene was expressed under control of the ugt73c <dig> promoter . histochemical analysis of gus expression in these lines revealed that the ugt73c <dig> promoter was active in a number of different cell types and was developmentally regulated . early in development, gus reporter expression was similar to that previously observed in ugt73c5pro:gus plants  <cit> : a pronounced staining in the vasculature of roots and hypocotyls of young seedlings, both when grown in the light and when incubated in the dark. however, as opposed to ugt73c5pro:gus plants gus reporter expression in ugt73c6pro:gus seedlings was not observed in epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. later in seedling development, in analogy to ugt73c5pro:gus the ugt73c6pro:gus reporter was still active in roots and hypocotyls and moreover was also expressed in cotyledons and true leaves. in contrast to ugt73c5pro:gus, ugt73c6pro:gus was in addition strongly expressed in stipules. in flowers ugt73c6pro:gus activity was present in sepals and in the stamen filaments. similar to ugt73c <dig>  ugt73c <dig> promoter expression was also detected in abscission zones.

in summary there is evidence that the ugt73c <dig> promoter is subjected to developmental regulation and that it is active in tissues, in which brs are also known to act. it is worth noting that, when analyzed, the ugt73c6pro:gus reporter was not found to be responsive to externally applied br . to verify this result quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of 8-day old seedlings of wild type, treated with 24-epibl for  <dig> hrs, was performed. the result showed that in this developmental stage, at  <dig> hrs post application, 24-epibl had little effect on ugt73c <dig> expression on a whole seedling level . in these conditions also ugt73c <dig> expression was not significantly altered, whereas dwf <dig>  rot <dig> and br6ox <dig>  genes that are repressed by br application  <cit> , were significantly decreased in their expression.

subcellular localization of ugt73c <dig> expression
to investigate the cellular sites of ugt73c <dig> protein localization plants expressing ugt73c6-yfp reporter constructs were generated. for this purpose two vectors were cloned: one in which the yfp-tagged coding sequence of ugt73c <dig> was placed down-stream of its own promoter , and another one in which the ugt73c6-yfp fusion was driven by the camv <dig> s promoter. a. thaliana plants stably expressing the two constructs were generated and yfp expression levels were assessed in seedlings of homozygous lines using western blot analysis. the results are illustrated in figure 3a and show that lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expressed ugt73c6-yfp to high levels; these lines also showed br-deficient phenotypes, indicating that the ugt73c6-yfp fusion was active.

imaging of yfp expression in seedlings of 35spro:ugt73c6-yfp and ugt73c6pro:ugt73c6-yfp lines using confocal microscopy revealed that ugt73c6-yfp was localized in the cytoplasm, as well as in the nucleus . as expected fluorescence in 35spro:ugt73c6-yfp was stronger than in ugt73c6pro:ugt73c6-yfp lines, but showed an identical localization pattern. 35spro:ugt73c5-yfp showed the same subcellular localization pattern as 35spro:ugt73c6-yfp .

to verify the nuclear localization of ugt73c6-yfp the reporter was transiently co-expressed with a cfp fusion of bes <dig>  a protein that is known to localize predominantly to the nucleus  <cit> , in tobacco. the result showed that ugt73c6-yfp co-localized with bes1-cfp  providing evidence that the ugt73c6-yfp reporter, in addition to the cytoplasm also localizes to the nucleus.

kinetics of bl-23-o-glucoside formation
to investigate the conversion of bl into bl-23glc in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants over time, a time-course feeding study was initiated. eleven-day-old seedlings of wild type col- <dig>  ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe were incubated with  <dig> μg/ml  of bl. samples were harvested in a time-course manner and bl-23glc formation was determined in tissue extracts by lc-hrms. as shown in figure 5a bl was rapidly incorporated, as evidenced by a strong increase in endogenous bl amounts following bl application. in wild type seedlings bl levels increased rapidly for  <dig> hrs following bl application, before they started to decline. bl levels in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe also increased for approximately  <dig> hrs post application of bl, however bl amounts only reached about 50% of the levels, which were accumulated in wild type .  <dig> hrs post application, bl levels in both wild type and ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe lines had dropped to levels below the limit of detection.

bl-23glc formation in wild type seedlings slowly increased for  <dig> hrs, before bl-23glc amounts started to decrease. in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants the concentration of bl-23glc strongly increased for approximately  <dig> hrs, reaching amounts which were approximately 10-fold higher, than those measured in wild type .

in summary exogenously applied bl was rapidly incorporate by both wild type and ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants and was thereafter efficiently removed. in contrast, following its formation, bl-23glc was maintained at elevated levels in plant tissues.

catabolic fate of br-23-o-glucosides
the decrease of bl-23glc levels in plant tissues, starting at  <dig> hrs post application of bl in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe seedlings and at  <dig> hrs in wild type, indicated that the bl-23glc formed was either immobilized, degraded or was further modified to yield products, which escaped detection. also, previously it had been shown that in bl-feeding studies of wild type a. thaliana, an initial increase in bl-23glc formation was followed by a decrease, indicating a further metabolization  <cit> . thus it was of interest to investigate the catabolic fate of externally applied cs and bl. lc-hrms was used to analyze br conjugates in seedlings of wild type, ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants, following  <dig> hrs of incubation with either cs or bl. in addition to significant amounts of br-23glc, minor peaks corresponding to br-2glc, br-sulfate and br-hydroxide were found. moreover, very interestingly, a previously unknown substance with a mass of m/z  <dig>  eluted at  <dig>  min , in seemingly high abundance, from the column . according to accurate mass measurements the compound was tentatively identified as bl-malonylglucoside . the theoretical mass of the sodium adduct of this substance is  <dig>  , the only possible sum formula is c37h60o <dig> . as malonylglucosides are formed from glucosides it is highly likely that the compound is bl-23-o-malonylglucoside .

similarly, as shown in figure  <dig>  when plants fed with cs were analyzed for cs-catabolites a peak at  <dig>  min , showing a m/z of  <dig> , appeared and was tentatively identified as cs-malonylglucoside . only one sum formula is conceivable when applying the criteria outlined above, namely c37h60o <dig> . again, it seems highly likely that the substance is cs-23-o-malonylglucoside . in addition to the putative br-malglcs br-diglucosides  were also identified. interestingly, both the formation of the putative br-malglcs and the br-diglucoside was increased in ugt73c6oe and ugt73c5oe seedlings as compared to those of wild type indicating that they were formed from br-23glcs . in analogy to br-23glc both br-diglc and the putative br-malglc were not only detected in plant extracts, but were also present in the media in which plants had been incubated for the feeding studies ; thus br-glcs formed in planta were released to the media.

in summary these results suggest that 23-o-glucosides of bl and cs are further modified by malonylation in planta.

kinetics of bl-glucoside catabolism in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants
to determine the kinetics of formation of the putative br-malglc and br-diglc, the samples of the time-course bl feeding studies were analyzed for an occurrence of bl-23glc catabolites. at present no analytical standard is available for bl-malglc to accurately quantify its amounts. however, as a rough estimate the same response factor as for bl-23glc was assumed, allowing for a semi-quantitative estimation of bl-malglc concentrations. similarly the concentration of bl-diglc was estimated by assuming the same response factor as for br-23glc. the results are illustrated in figure  <dig> and show levels of bl-malglc and bl-diglc in nmol/g fw, as compared to bl and bl-23glc amounts in seedlings of col- <dig>  ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe. all bl-glcs detected were present in all analyzed lines, however in wild type bl-diglc was close to the limit of detection with the applied lc-hrms method. amounts of the putative bl-malglc increased in wild type for  <dig> hrs and were then sustained . similarly the kinetics of putative bl-malglc formation in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe lines were characterized by an increase to a plateau concentration within  <dig> hrs of feeding, which was then sustained for the rest of the experiment . this is in contrast to bl and bl-23glc levels, which decreased in both wild type and ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe after having reached a peak. interestingly, a drop in bl-23glc amounts correlated with a corresponding increase in putative bl-malglc in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants, supporting the notion that bl-23glc was converted to bl-23malglc.

in summary the results show that in bl feeding studies of wild type, and ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe plants a decrease in bl-23glc levels correlated with an increase in putative bl-malglc, showing that bl-23glc was further conjugated. as opposed to bl and bl-23glc the putative bl-malglc did not decrease after an initial increase, suggesting that malonylation may protect 23-o-glucosylated bl from removal, in the soluble fractions analyzed.

discussion
glycosylation is considered an important regulatory mechanism that contributes to the control of hormone homeostasis and almost all major classes of hormones occur as glycoside-conjugates in planta  <cit> . brs are one class of plant hormones, which are glycosylated  <cit>  and previously we have shown that conjugation to glucose reduces br activity. over-expression of ugt73c <dig> led to a massive increase in br-23-o-glucosylation activity and to decreased levels of bioactive brs, evidenced both at the chemotypic and at the phenotypic level  <cit> . ugt73c <dig> belongs to a cluster of six closely related genes in the a. thaliana genome, ugt73c1-c <dig>  <cit> . the in vitro catalytic activities of the six gene products have been characterized to some extend, and it appears that members of the ugt73c subfamily can recognize a number of aglycons including secondary metabolites, plant hormones, fungal mycotoxins and xenobiotics as substrates in vitro  <cit> . however, nothing was known of the consequences of over-expressing the five remaining members of the 73c gene cluster ugt73c1-c <dig> and ugt73c <dig> on plant growth and development and in particular also on those growth processes regulated by brs. this study was designed to investigate those consequences, aiming at identifying possible functional homologues of ugt73c <dig>  and revealed that ugt73c <dig>  the closest homologue of ugt73c <dig>  can also accept brs as substrates in planta.

overexpression of ugt73c <dig> led to the same phenotypic effects as observed in ugt73c5oe plants: growth defects indicative of br deficiency. moreover at the chemotypic level ugt73c6oe plants were characterized by significantly reduced amounts of ty, 6-deoxocs and cs, which correlated with a strongly increased 23-o-glucosylation activity in cs and bl feeding studies. these data show that in planta ugt73c <dig> can catalyze 23-o-glucosylation of cs and bl and is likely also able to glucosylate ty and 6-deoxocs. interestingly, ugt73c <dig> was previously identified as a flavonol-3-o-glycoside-7-o-glucosyltransferase  <cit>  and was in vitro capable of recognizing an array of structurally highly diverse aglycons  <cit> . thus the question arose if, in addition to its role in quercetin-3-o-rhamnoside conjugation, ugt73c <dig> may also catalyze br glucosylation in planta. to try to answer this question seedlings of a ugt73c6ko line were analyzed for alterations in br-23-o-glucosylation activities, but no significant change in the formation of cs- and bl-23glcs were found. this result can be interpreted in several ways. first, it is possible that the endogenous gene ugt73c <dig> does not function in br-23-o-glucosylation in planta. second, the expression and function of ugt73c <dig> may be highly specific to particular cells or developmental events, and the impact of losing its activity was not observed under the conditions assayed in this study. third, ugt73c <dig> or other gts that glucosylate brs in planta, and are co-ordinately regulated, may complement for a loss of ugt73c <dig> function and thus, knocking out ugt73c <dig> only will not produce a phenotype. indeed functional redundancy is characteristic of regulatory events governing br action  <cit>  and has also been shown to play a role in br catabolism: the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase sob <dig> acts redundantly with bas <dig> in the inactivation of brs  <cit> . to refine ugt73c <dig> function in the context of functional redundancy it was therefore aimed to generate plants deficient in the expression of both ugt73c <dig> and ugt73c <dig>  however, several approaches including the use of rnai  <cit>  and artificial micrornas  <cit> , failed in generating double knock-down plants. thus, in summary we provide evidence that ugt73c <dig> is capable of glucosylating brs in planta, however at present we cannot answer the question if br glucosylation is also a physiological function of ugt73c <dig>  further work will be needed to address this issue.

the expression of ugt73c <dig> was analyzed at the subcellular and cellular level and it was found that ugt73c <dig> shows over-lapping, but also distinct expression/localization patterns with ugt73c <dig>  gus reporter data suggests that transcript abundance of both genes is developmentally regulated and is enriched in vascular tissues, which are also tissues in which genes involved in br biosynthesis are preferentially expressed  <cit> . at the transcriptional level, in seedlings, ugt73c <dig> expression was not found to be responsive to externally applied br. however, interestingly ugt73c <dig> mrna levels are increased in response to a large variety of stimuli including  toxins of exogenous and endogenous origin such as the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol  <cit> , the explosive tnt  <cit> , the herbicide imidazolinone  <cit> , as well as the allelochemical benzoxazolin-2-one  <cit>  and oligogalacturonides released from plant cell walls by pathogen polygalacturonases  <cit> , and  abiotic and biotic stress factors such as salt stress  <cit>  and botrytis cinerea infections  <cit> . therefore ugt73c <dig> has been proposed to comprise a component of a co-ordinately regulated, broad specificity, xenobiotic defense response machinery  <cit> . ugt73c <dig> shows a similar responsiveness to toxins in its transcriptional regulation  <cit>  and it will thus be interesting to determine how responsiveness to abiotic and biotic stimuli is coordinated with the putative functions of ugt73c <dig> and ugt73c <dig> in glucosylating brs and/or flavonols.

on a cellular level yfp reporter data indicate that ugt73c <dig> and ugt73c <dig> localize to the cytoplasm and intriguingly also to the nucleus. in mammals, where there is considerable interest in udp-glucuronyltransferases as regulators of metabolic homeostasis, it is thought that, in addition to cytoplasmatic functions, ugts may also act in the nucleus to control the steady state of ligands for nuclear receptors and protect nuclear components from toxins  <cit> . in this context the ugt2b <dig>  which glycosylates steroid hormones, retinoids, fatty acids as well as xenobiotics, has been shown to be present and active both in the er and in the nucleus  <cit> . also plant ugts have previously been found to exhibit dual subcellular localizations  <cit> , however the functional significance is as yet unknown.

another so far unresolved question is the function of br-glc formation. whereas it is well documented that glycosylation can alter the bioactivity of plant hormones including auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and gibberellins the reason why glycoside conjugates are inactive is unclear  <cit> . in principle glycosylation could inhibit hormone activity directly by interfering with receptor recognition or indirectly by inducing events, which are enabled by the glycosylation status  <cit> . in this context, glycosylation is known to facilitate transport and results of this study indicate that also br glycosides are transported, either actively or passively. glycosylation is also considered to alter the stability of aglycons  <cit>  and here first evidence is presented which indicates that 23-o-glucosylation protects brs from degradation and/or catabolism. moreover it is shown for the first time that cs- and bl-23glcs are further conjugated, likely by malonylation.

malonylation is an aliphatic acylation, which involves a regiospecific malonyl group transfer from malonyl-coa to the glycosyl moiety of a glycoside, and is catalyzed by acyltransferases of the bahd family  <cit> . malonylation modifies secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids and is considered to enhance solubility, protect glycosides from enzymatic degradation by glycosidases and facilitate their intracellular transport  <cit> . malonylation has also been implicated in the regulation of hormone homeostasis. the ethylene precursor acc can be irreversibly conjugated to form n-malonyl-acc  <cit>  and thus malonylation of acc decreases the levels of ethylene in producing tissues. in regard to br catabolism the results of this study show that the putative bl-malglc formed in ugt73c5oe and ugt73c6oe lines is less readily removed from soluble cellular fractions than bl-23glc, indicating that malonylation may serve to protect bl-23glc from catabolism or degradation by enzymes such as glucosidases. in this context it will be interesting to determine if de-glucosylation is a means of reactivating brs from br-glcs and thus, if br-glcs may serve as readily available br storage forms.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary this study provides evidence that in addition to ugt73c <dig>  also its closest homologue ugt73c <dig>  is able to catalyze 23-o-glucosylation of the bioactive brs cs and bl in planta. future studies will address the question, if br glucosylation is a physiological role of both ugts, and if this potential multiplicity may provide a highly flexible system for homeostatic adaptation at a cellular level.
