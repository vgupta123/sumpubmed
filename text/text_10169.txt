BACKGROUND
in photosynthesis, excess excitation energy supports formation of reactive oxygen species   <cit>  which can damage metabolites, enzymes and structures  <cit> . antioxidant enzymes detoxify ros, dissipate excess energy and regenerate the electron acceptors nadp+ and thioredoxin. as part of the acclimation to unfavourable growth conditions, expression of antioxidant enzymes increases under moderate stress conditions  <cit> . under severe stress conditions gene expression decreases  <cit> . in addition, various antioxidant enzymes, such as ascorbate peroxidases   <cit>  and peroxiredoxins  <cit> , are inactivated. accumulating ros decrease the photosynthetic activity  <cit>  and activate cytosolic defence mechanisms  <cit> .

in cuzn-superoxide dismutase  knock-down lines of arabidopsis, photooxidative stress alters strongest the expression pattern of chloroplast proteins  <cit> . consistently, in 2-cys peroxiredoxin  antisense lines the imbalance in the chloroplast redox poise induces expression of chloroplast apx and monodehydroascorbate reductase  <cit> . in planta analysis of 2cpa promoter regulation  <cit>  demonstrated that nuclear transcription of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes responds to chloroplast signals. the redox state of the plastoquinone pool  <cit> , the redox state of low molecular weight antioxidants  <cit> , the acceptor availability at photosystem i  <cit>  and ros  <cit>  have been postulated to signal the chloroplast redox poise. signal transduction through ros, oxylipins, protochlorophyllides, metabolic coupling by carbohydrates and the redox poise of nad+/nadh, mapk cascades and aba have been indicated  <cit> . presently, signal transduction is under intensive investigation  <cit> . first results demonstrate the signalling function of mg2+-protoporphyrins and the aba-triggered transcription factor abi <dig> in correlation of nuclear gene expression with chloroplast development upon greening  <cit> . however, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating nuclear expression of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes in green tissues in a redox-dependent manner are still elusive.

mutants screened for low expression of the nuclear encoded chloroplast 2cpa  differentiated transcriptional regulation of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes from typical responses to ros accumulation, such as the induction of lipoxygenase- <dig> , ascorbate peroxidase- <dig> , bap <dig> and fer <dig>  <cit>  . many genes for cytosolic antioxidant enzymes, such as apx <dig>  are gradually induced to very high levels. the expression intensity correlates with the availability of the regulating transcription factor  <cit> . in contrast, expression of most chloroplast antioxidant enzymes is induced up to a certain stress level, but decreased in response to severe oxidative stress conditions, such as application of high concentrations of h2o <dig>  <cit>  , it is hypothesized that either a plus-minus regulator or interacting antagonistic signalling pathways control gene expression.

in respect of transcriptional regulation, the 2cpa is one of the best studied genes encoding a chloroplast antioxidant enzyme. transcription is strongest in young developing tissues  <cit> . on top of the developmental regulation, the transcription intensity correlates with the acceptor availability at photosystem-i   <cit> , which defines the reduction states of nadp+ and thioredoxins  <cit> . in planta promoter analysis demonstrated that photosynthetic redox signal is sensed in a distinct promoter region. the target motif is located upstream of the  <dig> bp core promoter, that correlates 2cpa expression with chloroplast development  <cit> . various nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins are co-regulated with 2cpa  <cit> . piippo et al.  <cit>  postulated that the reducing site of ps-i actually is a major signal initiation point in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling.

a  <dig> bp redox-sensitive cis-regulatory region has been identified in the 2cpa promoter. it responds to the chloroplast redox signals  <cit> . since sequence analysis gave no indication for interaction with a known redox-regulated transcription factor, a yeast-one-hybrid screen was performed to identify cis-regulatory proteins. here isolation and characterization of the transcription factor rap <dig> a is presented. rap <dig> a is redox-sensitive, binds to a ce3-like element in the redox-sensitive promoter region and regulates transcription of 2cpa. analysis of rap <dig> a-ko lines demonstrated that the transcription factor also impacts on expression of other nuclear encoded chloroplast antioxidant enzymes and protects plants against mild stresses, such as fluctuating environmental light conditions.

RESULTS
isolation of rap <dig> a
to identify cis-regulatory proteins involved in transcriptional regulation of 2cpa, a yeast-one-hybrid  screen was performed with the  <dig> bp redox-active 2cpa promoter domain  <cit>  and its flanking regions. the bait element was cloned into the vector pone- <dig> upstream of the gal <dig>  minimal promoter and the his3-cdna. the vector was transformed into the yeast strain y <dig>  preys were provided by co-transformation of y <dig> with a cdna library derived from an arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension culture  <cit> . strongest interaction with the 2cpa promoter dna was observed with pact2-clone <dig>  which encodes a fusion protein of the gal4-activation domain  and the ap2-type transcription factor rap <dig> a   <cit>  spaced by  <dig> amino acids .

the interaction of the ad-rap <dig> a-fusion protein with the bait was confirmed on media supplemented with  <dig> mm 3-amino- <dig> ,4-triazol , which is an inhibitor of his-biosynthesis. to exclude epigenetic regulation, the yeast strain y <dig> was retransformed with e. coli-amplified prey and bait constructs. survival on  <dig> mm 3at confirmed the strong interaction between the transcription factor and the target element.

localization of the rap <dig> a-binding site in the 2cpa promoter
with five overlapping dna-fragments  covering the y1h-bait, the binding site of rap <dig> a was mapped to the  <dig> bp overlap of f <dig> and f <dig> by emsa under non-reducing conditions . the rap <dig> a target sequence was confirmed with a synthetic double-stranded  <dig> bp oligonucleotide . heterologously expressed rap <dig>   , which shares  <dig> % sequence identity with rap <dig> a in the dna-binding site , and control lysates of e. coli, which were transformed with an empty expression vector , did not shift any 2cpa promoter fragment. alternative to monitoring the gel shifts by immunodetection of his-tagged proteins, the interaction between the bait element and rap <dig> a was analysed by detection of biotinylated pcr-products using horseradish peroxidise-coupled streptavidin . here, immunodetection of the proteins was chosen as routine method, since both methods showed the interaction of dna and proteins, but immunodetection of his-tags turned out to be easier and more efficient to apply.

pattern analysis by matinspector  <cit>  predicted a coupling element  <dig> -like motif  in the  <dig> bp target sequence. the motif deviates in the two bases following the cgcg-core from the typical ce3-element  <cit>  . replacing the cgcg-core by ttgt abolished binding of rap <dig> a to double-stranded  <dig> bp oligonucleotides , like single nucleotide substitutions of c <dig> and g <dig> did . it is concluded that c <dig> and g <dig> of the cgcg-core are essential for rap <dig> a binding.

ce3s often confer aba-responsiveness along with acgt-abres  <cit> . for example, trab <dig> can alternatively recognize the two motifs  <cit>  and rap <dig> b can take over drebp and erf-function if overexpressed  <cit> . however, rap <dig> a neither bound the acgt-variant of the ce <dig>  nor the abre predicted  <dig> bp upstream of the ce3-like element  demonstrating the specificity of rap <dig> a for the ce3-like element.

in vivo function of c3g <dig> in rap <dig> a-regulation of 2cpa transcription
the regulatory function of rap <dig> a on the 2cpa promoter was tested by transient rap <dig> a over-expression  in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts which were transfected with 2cpawt:yfp. standardized on co-transfected 35s:cfp,  <dig> h rap <dig> a over-expression resulted in ca. 5-fold higher yfp activity than in an empty vector control  demonstrating that rap <dig> a is an activating transcription factor.

to test the in vivo function of c3g <dig> of the ce3-like element on rap <dig> a activation of 2cpa transcription, arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected either with reporter constructs expressing yfp under control of the wild-type promoter  or a mutagenized promoter , in which tt substituted for c3g <dig> . after normalization on the expression of co-transfected 35s:cfp reference constructs the yfp/cfp expression ratio of the tt-variant  was decreased by  <dig> % compared to 2cpawt:yfp after  <dig> h incubation  confirming the regulatory function of the two nucleotides in stabilization of the interaction between the transcription factor and the promoter, however it did not fully omit 2cpa promoter activation.

localization of rap <dig> a in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts
since rap <dig> a lacks a strong nuclear localization signal and chloroplast targeting has been suggested for the ib-erf rap <dig> c   <cit> , the distribution of rap <dig> a protein was analysed in arabidopsis protoplasts expressing rap <dig> a-yfp fusion proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy  . after  <dig> h incubation, the majority of the protein  was observed in the nucleus like for the yfp-fusion protein of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor abi <dig> , while only  <dig> Â±  <dig> % of free yfp was detected in the nucleus .

redox regulation of rap <dig> a-dependent 2cpa transcription
luciferase reporter elements have a lower stability and higher sensitivity and time-resolution than fluorescence proteins  <cit> . hence, redox regulation of the 2cpa promoter was studied in a transgenic 2cpa:luciferase line  <cit> . the luciferase activity was  <dig> -fold increased in 35s:rap <dig> a transfected protoplasts compared to 35s:cfp-transfected ones after  <dig> h incubation . the quick response demonstrated fast and strong activation of 2cpa by rap <dig> a.

relative luciferase activity  in mesophyll protoplasts from transgenic arabidopsis expressing luciferase under control of the 2cpa promoter,  <dig> h after transfection with either 35s:rap <dig> a or 35s:cfp, and  <dig>  h after application of  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  dtt and ascorbate, respectively. significance of difference  is indicated by asterisks.

to test the function of rap <dig> a in redox-regulation of 2cpa expression, the cellular redox poise was decreased by application of  <dig> mm dtt or ascorbate. the antioxidants decreased the luciferase activity in rap <dig> a over-expressing protoplasts by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, within  <dig> min .  <dig> mm h2o <dig> increased the luciferase activity in 35s:rap <dig> a lines by  <dig> % compared to control conditions . with h2o2-concentrations higher than  <dig> mm the reporter gene activity decreased again indication inactivation . under control conditions and in  <dig> mm h2o2-treated samples, transfection with rap <dig> a cdna resulted in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the luciferase activity observed in the cfp transfected protoplasts. it is concluded that rap <dig> a activates the reporter gene. in contrast, the reporter gene activity was decreased in dtt and ascorbate treated samples. this observation suggested that rap <dig> a binding is redox-dependent.

redox regulation of the rap <dig> a dna binding was studied with  <dig> Î¼g rap <dig> a and  <dig> pmol f <dig> in presence of either  <dig> mm dtt or h2o <dig> relative to an untreated control. dna-binding was analysed fluorometrically by quantitative pcr after separation on agarose gels. in h2o2-treated samples  <dig> Â±  <dig> % of f <dig> was detected compared to untreated controls. in dtt-treated samples, the amount of free f <dig> was  <dig> Â±  <dig> % that of untreated samples , demonstrating that both, h2o <dig> and dtt abolished dna binding.

the relative amount of unbound dna  after incubation of  <dig> Î¼g rap <dig> a with  <dig> pmol f <dig> in  <dig>  Ã tbe of  <dig>  Ã tbe supplemented with  <dig> mm dtt or h2o <dig>  gel extraction of unbound f <dig>  pcr amplification and fluorometric detection on agarose gels. significance of difference is indicated by asterisks 

redox regulation of rap <dig> a protein
on sds-page recombinant rap <dig> a separated with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and larger aggregates indicating monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric forms of the transcription factor . dtt abolished the oligomers, reduced the dimeric fraction and increased the amount of monomer . after application of mild h2o <dig> concentrations  only high molecular weight bands were detected. treatment with  <dig> mm h2o <dig> resulted in a complete loss of rap <dig> a signals on the western-blots indicating that either high molecular mass complexes were formed, which did not migrate into the gel any more or that large protein aggregates were formed that there were beyond the transfer limits of western-blotting. to test whether aggregates were formed and whether they were reversible, the samples were treated with  <dig> mm of the reductant Î²-mercaptoethanol minutes after the incubation with  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  with Î²-mercaptoethanol, high amounts of monomeric rap <dig> a were detected demonstrating that h2o <dig> by its own formed reversible high molecular weight complexes .

cysteine residues are typical targets for redox regulation of proteins. rap <dig> a contains  <dig> cysteine residues at the positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are located outside of the dna-binding motif  in the n- and c-terminal domains. they are not conserved in the ib-erf-subfamily of ap2-family of transcription factors and specific to rap <dig> a . by equilibrium-based redox titration the midpoint redox potential of - <dig> mv was determined for the transition from rap <dig> a monomers to dimers . the relative amount of oligomers started to increase at redox potentials higher than - <dig> mv  consistent with the observation that oligomerization occurred at oxidizing conditions . due to the difficulties to blot the aggregates quantitatively  and the high number of different aggregates formed , it is impossible to determine the precise redox poise for the induction of aggregation. from the observations presented in fig. 4a and 4b, it is suggested that it is a gradual multi-step process promoted by highly oxidizing conditions.

effect of rap <dig> a deletion on gene expression using t-dna insertion lines
rap <dig> a is expressed in roots and shoots . like the 2cpa transcript amount, rap <dig> a mrna levels decreased in leaves upon application of  <dig> mm ascorbate  and sugars .

the in planta function of rap <dig> a in 2cpa expression was assessed in t-dna insertion lines of arabidopsis thaliana. the rap <dig> a gene is interrupted upstream of the ap2-type dna-binding site . consequently, rap <dig> a-ko-lines lacked rap <dig> a mrna . from the f <dig> progeny of the backcross and from the t <dig> progeny of the salk-line several independent homozygous lines were selected for analysis.

in the rap <dig> a-ko-lines the 2cpa transcript level was decreased . in parallel, the transcript levels of csd <dig>  which encodes the major chloroplast csd , stromal and thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidases , the stress inducible large subunit of the adp-glucose-pyrophosphorylase , the rieske protein  and several transcripts encoding subunits of the light-harvesting complex , lhca <dig>   and lhca <dig>  were less than in wild-type plants . although 2cpa transcription is suppressed by ascorbate in wild-type plants  <cit> , , the transcript level was increased in rap <dig> a-ko lines .

the transcript levels of selected genes known to be induced by ros, e.g. the transcription factor zat <dig>  and the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase apx <dig>  were slightly increased in rap <dig> a-ko, like the transcript levels of plastocyanin  and the ethylene-inducible drebp-analogous rap <dig> b . the transcript amount of three other ib-erf transcription factors including the chloroplast targeted ib-erf rap <dig> c   <cit> , and that of chloroplast gr were only by  <dig> â  <dig> % decreased compared to wild-type plants.

effect of rap <dig> a disruption on environmental stability
after adaptation to controlled environmental conditions, the rap <dig> a-ko t-dna-insertion lines showed only subtile phenotypes: the chlorophyll levels were slightly decreased and the leaf blades were  <dig> % larger . three independent sets of  <dig> plants were pre-cultivated for  <dig> weeks under controlled conditions . afterwards, they were transferred to the greenhouse and exposed to naturally fluctuating light conditions. after two changes between two cloudy  and two sunny days , rap <dig> a-ko lines gradually developed stress phenotypes, such as severe chlorosis, stunted, thicker and less branched inflorescences and increased leaf blade areas . in average the chlorophyll contents were decreased by  <dig> Â±  <dig> %  compared to wild-type plants and the leaf blade area increased to  <dig> Â±  <dig> % . in total in  <dig> % of the rap <dig> a-ko plants the chlorophyll content was at least decreased by  <dig> %. in  <dig> % of the plants the leaf blade area of the largest  <dig> leaves was at least twice the size of the largest leaves of wild-type-plants grown in parallel .

discussion
2cpa transcription is redox-regulated on top of a strong developmental regulation, which correlates with chloroplast development and greening  <cit> . redox-regulation is a fine-tuning mechanism which coordinates nuclear expression of the chloroplast protein with the actual environmental parameters  <cit> . in a one-hybrid screen for cis-regulatory proteins binding to the redox-sensitive promoter element of the 2cpa gene, the transcription factor rap <dig> a  was isolated. rap <dig> a binds to a ce3-like element in a redox-dependent manner  and activates 2cpa expression under control and slightly oxidizing conditions . although the ce3-like element in the 2cpa promoter differs from abre only in one base , rap <dig> a specifically bound to the ce3-like element.

according to the nomenclature by nakano et al.  <cit> , who recently grouped  <dig> ap2-type transcription factors into  <dig> clades, the isolated transcription factor rap <dig> a is one of eight class-ib-erf proteins with conserved ap2-domains, but highly variant n- and c-termini  <cit> . two class-ib-erfs have so far been partially characterized: rap <dig> b  complements drebp and blocks ethylene signalling if it is overexpressed in arabidopsis  <cit> . rap <dig> c  is post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts where it may take over a specific, so far unknown function  <cit> .

analysis of rap <dig> a knock-out lines  demonstrated that rap <dig> a is, unlike rap <dig> b, not fully complemented by homologous and analogous transcription factors. hence, rap <dig> a has a specific function in plant gene regulation. expression of several genes was impaired in absence of rap <dig> a  and rap <dig> a-free  plants were more susceptible to fluctuating environmental conditions .

rap <dig> a binding to dna is redox regulated. it is omitted under strongly reducing and strongly oxidizing conditions . from in vitro analysis it has to be expected that the protein monomerizes or oligomerize, respectively, under these conditions. in between, under control and slightly oxidizing conditions, the transcription factor is in its dimeric state . since rap <dig> a activated the gene expression under these conditions , it is concluded that dimeric rap <dig> a stimulates promoter acitivity.

redox regulation of proteins is often maintained though thiol-disulfide regulation. within the rap <dig>  family of transcription factors rap <dig> a is characterized by a distinct signature of cysteinyl residues. while one cysteinyl residue, which is conserved in other group members, is missing, the cysteine residue at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are specific for rap <dig> a. redox-dependent oligomerization may indicate intermolecular disulfide formation and/or structural changes that foster aggregation in hetero- or homo-complexes and finally inactivation .

in vivo and in vitro gene expression analysis  demonstrated that rap <dig> a confers redox responsiveness to the 2cpa promoter by redox-dependent binding and activation . in addition, rap <dig> a availability impacts on the expression of various other nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins involved in adaptation of plants to environmental variation. increased transcript levels of ros-regulated zat <dig>  <cit>  and stress-induced rap <dig> b  <cit>  demonstrate that rap <dig> a function antagonizes activation of secondary signalling cascades which are activated at higher stress thresholds. because no homologous rap <dig> a binding sites could have been identified in the promoters of co-regulated genes , it is assumed that the other antioxidant enzymes are indirectly co-regulated by a so far unknown mechanism. from comparison of rap <dig> a-ko lines with 2cpa antisense lines, cross talk by the availability of 2cpa mrna or protein can be excluded. it is more likely that rap <dig> a triggers secondary transcription factors, which in turn activate the other nuclear genes for chloroplast antioxidant enzymes.

the midpoint redox potential of the activating transition from rap <dig> a monomer to dimer is - <dig> mv at ph  <dig>  . it is more negative than the midpoint potential of glutathione , but less than that of most thioredoxins   <cit> . moderate oxidation of the glutathione pool, such as caused by photosynthetic activity and propagated by thioredoxins and the redox poise of the nad+/nadph and the glutathione systems  <cit> , may be sufficient to activate rap <dig> a-dependent gene expression. stronger redox imbalances would inactivate rap <dig> a by aggregate formation  and consequently support accumulation of ros . while over-expression of rap <dig> a promotes 2cpa expression under control and mildly oxidizing conditions, under reducing conditions it does not impact on 2cpa expression . it is concluded that rap <dig> a only confers its activating potential in its dimerized state .

rap <dig> a impacts on nuclear expression of chloroplast proteins ranging from antioxidant enzymes to light-harvesting proteins . the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, metabolic redox signals and ros have been postulated to be signals indicating progressing deviation from metabolic equilibrium by increased photosynthetic electron pressure  <cit> . in rap <dig> -ko the transcript level of pete, which responds to the redox state of the plastoquinone pool  <cit> , was increased indicating a higher reduction state of the intersystem electron transport chain. slightly increased transcript levels of the ros-marker genes zat <dig>  which encodes a strongly inducible transcription factor activating expression of cytosolic apx  <cit> , and its target gene apx <dig>  which encodes a ros-inducible cytosolic antioxidant enzyme  <cit> , in the rap <dig> -ko-line  indicate that rap <dig> a antagonizes ros-signalling in wild-type plants and differentiates rap <dig> a-dependent gene expression regulation from regulation of cytosolic antioxidant defence mechanisms. this observation is consistent with the analysis of the rimb-mutants, which were screened for decreased activation of the 2cpa promoter  <cit> , suggesting that the regulation of genes encoding chloroplast antioxidant enzymes is independent from regulation of genes for cytosolic antioxidants. for transmission of ros-signals, specific transcription factors, such as zat <dig>  <cit> , have been described. now, characterization of rap <dig> a shows the first mechanism which explains redox regulation of nuclear expression of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
piippo et al.  <cit>  postulated recently that the acceptor availability at photosystem i, which regulates 2cpa transcriptional activity  <cit> , has a stronger impact on nuclear gene expression than the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. here, it is shown that the transcription factor rap <dig> a is a redox regulator with redox sensory function. rap <dig> a is involved in the signalling pathway triggering the 2cpa redox box  <cit> , which responds to the acceptor availability at photosystem i  <cit> . the sensitivity of rap <dig> a-ko lines  demonstrates that rap <dig> a regulates tolerance against natural environmental fluctuation via the control of the nuclear expression of the chloroplast antioxidant and photosynthetic systems . rap <dig> a acts as a plus/minus regulator . rap <dig> a is activated by moderate redox imbalances, but inactivated upon severe stress  consistent with decreased transcript levels for nuclear genes encoding chloroplast antioxidant after ros-application  <cit> . it is concluded that rap <dig> a controls plant risk-assessment. it can switch gene expression between induction of acclimation reactions and molecular stress avoidance, such as ros-controlled inactivation of photosynthetic electron transport.
