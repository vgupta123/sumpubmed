BACKGROUND
the hydroxy fatty acid ricinoleate  is an important natural raw material with great value as a petrochemical replacement in a variety of industrial processes. its derivatives are found in products such as lubricants, nylon, dyes, soaps, inks, adhesives, and biodiesel  <cit> . the seeds of castor plant  are the major source of ricinoleate, which constitutes about 90% of the total fatty acids of the seed oil. however, oilseed castor cultivation is limited to tropical and sub-tropical regions, and seeds are laboriously harvested by methods that are difficult to adapt to large-scale production. in addition, castor seeds contain the poisonous ricin as well as strongly allergenic 2s albumins, which pose health threats for workers during planting, harvesting and processing. it is therefore highly desirable to produce ricinoleate in temperate oilseed crops through genetic engineering.

ricinoleate biosynthesis in castor seeds is catalyzed by an oleate Δ12-hydroxylase , a close homologue of the oleate Δ12-desaturase   <cit> . the fah <dig> adds a hydroxy group  to the twelfth carbon of oleic acid moieties esterified to the sn- <dig> position of phosphatidylcholine  <cit> . expression of fah <dig> in transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis caused the accumulation of hydroxy fatty acids, but only to about 17% of total seed oil, far less than that in the native castor seeds  <cit> . to increase ricinoleate in transgenic oilseeds and create a castor oil replacement, it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms of lipid metabolism in castor seed. we are specifically interested in the expression profile of genes that are co-expressed with the fah <dig> gene because some of these gene products may also contribute to ricinoleate accumulation in developing castor seeds. expressed sequence tag  analysis provides a convenient and efficient gateway for identification of genes expressed in specific tissues and cells as well as allowing characterization of the level of transcript expression  <cit> . despite the availability of a small number  of ests from developing castor endosperm  <cit> , and a more wealthy est collection from leaves recently released by the institute of genome research  <cit> , gene expression information in developing castor endosperm is limited. there was no full-length cdna resource in castor either. in this report, we sequenced the 5'ends of about  <dig>  cdna clones from a full-length cdna library derived from developing castor endosperm, the storage organ in castor seed. we analyzed the abundance of specific cdnas from  <dig>  est sequences. we found that the castor oleate desaturase  sequence is much less abundant than that of the fah <dig> in our cdna sequences, suggesting a transcriptional control of these two genes in castor endosperm to favor ricinoleate accumulation.

RESULTS
single-pass sequencing of a castor full-length cdna library
in order to systematically analyze genes expressed in developing castor seeds and to facilitate functional analysis of the cdna clones, we constructed an oriented full-length cdna library in a lambda vector that incorporated the gateway cloning system. the quality of this library was assessed by pcr and sequencing of the inserted cdna clones. the length of insert cdna clones ranged from ~ <dig> bp to over  <dig> kb, which reflected the size distribution of the first-strand cdna population. moreover, many genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism are present in the library  <cit> . our analysis after sequencing of  <dig> clones indicated that over 90% of the clones contain full-length protein coding sequences  <cit> . these observations suggested that there was not significant bias towards short cdna clones during the full-length library construction. in this study, we sequenced the 5'-ends of about  <dig>  plasmid clones that were excised from the amplified lambda library by the gateway cloning process. to maximize the efficiency of cdna sequencing, we used a sequencing primer located immediately adjacent to the 5'ends of cdna inserts. this yielded  <dig>  high quality  sequences, which included approximately  <dig>  m castor sequence. further examination resulted in  <dig>  sequences that contained over  <dig> nucleotides with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides per est . visual examination of  <dig> random sequences and their translated results using the translation tool  indicated that the average length of the 5'-untranslated region  is about  <dig> nucleotides. cluster analysis and assembly of these sequences resulted in a total of  <dig>  unique est sequences with  <dig> contigs   and  <dig>  singletons . we have deposited  <dig>  sequences in the dbest division of genbank.

highly expressed genes mostly encode storage proteins and oleosins
the purpose of this study is to obtain a brief snapshot of genes expressed in developing castor endosperm, and to identify genes that may contribute to ricinoleate accumulation. we compared each unique est sequence with the non-redundant  protein databases of the ncbi and arabidopsis proteins at tair using the blastx program. the results  indicated that about 95% of the sequences identified homologues in arabidopsis or other organisms. the remaining 5% of the genes encode proteins that may be unique to castor, or to the euphorbiaceae, since no homologues were found in the available databases. about 13% of the genes encode proteins whose functions in arabidopsis or other organisms remain unknown. table  <dig> lists the most abundant sequences  from the library. similar to the ests in developing arabidopsis seeds  <cit> , genes encoding storage proteins are the most abundant ones in developing castor seed, comprising about 18% of the total. these proteins include ricinus communis seed storage proteins, a legume-like protein and its precursor, and the allergenic 2s albumin and its precursor. genes encoding the toxic proteins ricin and agglutinin are also highly expressed in developing castor endosperm . this information is useful for the transgenic strategy to eliminate the toxic ricin and agglutinin and the allergenic 2s albumin from castor seeds  <cit> . on the other hand, normalization of the library by eliminating these highly abundant sequences before further sequence analysis will increase the efficiency of gene discovery, since genes expressed in fewer copies will be more readily detected.

oil-body oleosin genes are also highly expressed, making up about 4% of the total sequences. the  <dig> ests for oleosins in the sequenced clones represent  <dig> different genes according to sequence similarity to arabidopsis oleosin homologues. these genes are expressed at different levels. the castor oleosin rcole <dig> , a homologue of the arabidopsis at4g <dig>  is the most abundant one . there are  <dig> ests representing the rcole <dig> , a homologue of at3g <dig>  others are much less abundant. only two ests are homologous to at5g <dig>  and one est each for the oleosins that are homologous to at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  respectively. in contrast, expression levels of different oleosins in developing arabidopsis seeds vary less dramatically. for example, the est counts for at4g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively from  <dig>  sequences  <cit> . the relatively high abundant 21-kd oleosin gene  in arabidopsis seeds is absent in our cdna sequences of castor. these findings suggest that different oleosins may play different roles in oil accumulation in castor and arabidopsis seeds. in our high-throughput screening experiment, we found that co-expressing rcole <dig>  with fah <dig> resulted in moderately increased hydroxy fatty acid accumulation in transgenic arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . at4g <dig> plays an important role in regulating oil body size in arabidopsis seed  <cit> . the abundance of rcole <dig> in our est collection suggests it may play a similar role in castor seed.

the acidic lipases are highly expressed in developing castor endosperm
besides storage proteins, oleosins, ricin and a metallothionein-like protein as listed in table  <dig>  there are several genes that are somewhat abundant in our cdna library. these include lipid transfer proteins, genes encoding components of the protein biosynthetic apparatus such as alanine aminotransferase, ribosomal proteins, and elongation factor 1-alapha, as well as proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, and triosephosphate isomerase. the genes in this class also include the oleate hydroxylase  and other genes of lipid metabolism such as acyl carrier protein , stearoyl-acp desaturase, and malonyl-coa:acp transacylase.

interestingly, as listed in table  <dig>  we identified a class- <dig> triacylglycerol lipase  that is highly abundant  in our cdna library. this gene, we termed rctgl <dig>  was recently characterized as an acidic triacylglycerol  lipase of the castor bean  <cit> . a close homologue of this gene  with 87% sequence identity was also identified , and its full-length sequence was determined . the rctgl3- <dig> gene is moderately abundant in our cdna library . the more abundant rctgl <dig> gene is specifically expressed in developing castor endosperm as revealed by rt-pcr analysis . the function of a tag lipase is to hydrolyze tag into fatty acids and the intermediate products diacylglycerol or monoacylglycerol. the high level of expression of the tag lipases along with many lipid synthetic genes in developing endosperm of castor seeds raised questions about their roles in seed development or lipid accumulation. speculating that they might play a role in ricinoleate accumulation in castor endosperm, we transformed the two lipase homologues independently into a fah12-expressing arabidopsis line, cl <dig>  <cit> , and the fatty acid methyl esters of the transgenic seeds were analyzed by gc. the fatty acid compositions of the transgenic seeds that co-expressed fah <dig> and either lipase genes showed no significant difference from those of cl <dig> . this result suggested that the lipases might not have significant contribution to fatty acid synthesis in transgenic arabidopsis seeds. we did not pursue further studies of the transgenic lines since they had no effect on hydroxy fatty acid accumulation. whether the transgenic lipase genes have altered lipase activities and their consequences on seed metabolism and physiology remain subjects of future investigations.

it is not clear why lipases express at such a high level of expression in developing seeds while lipid synthesis is actively taking place. the acidic lipase protein has also been detected in dry and germinating castor seeds  <cit> , suggesting a role in breakdown of storage lipids to support post-germinative seedling development. however, the presence of a neutral or alkaline tag lipase in castor seed and its predominant role in lipolysis  <cit>  conflicts with this simple interpretation. reverse-genetic analysis by knockout or knock-down of these genes in castor plant may provide an answer to the function of the acidic lipases in developing seeds, as transformation technology has recently been extended to castor  <cit> .

the fad <dig> gene is not highly expressed in developing castor seed
one of our purposes in analyzing ests was to identify genes that are important to lipid metabolism in castor endosperm. in contrast to a very high abundance of oleosins, and the moderately high abundance of some genes including the fah <dig> and others that are listed in table  <dig>  most genes involved in lipid metabolism occur once or a few times in our est data. although about 3% of the genes we identified encode proteins involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism, they represent a small proportion of the approximately  <dig> lipid metabolism genes expressed in arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . for example, genes encoding enzymes such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase and others known to play major roles in tag biosynthesis were not detected by our est analysis, although some were detected by pcr analysis of our library  <cit> .

we identified only one cdna clone amongst our ests encoding the yet uncharacterized castor fad <dig> oleate desaturase, and determined the full-length sequence of this gene . the deduced amino acid sequence of castor fad <dig> shares a high level  of identity to that of the fah <dig> . to confirm the functional identity of the castor fad <dig> cdna, we have cloned the corresponding orf into the expression vector pyes <dig>  behind the inducible promoter gal <dig>  and transformed into s. cerevisiae cells. yeast cells have been used successfully for functional expression of several plant microsomal desaturases including fad <dig>  as they act as a very convenient host due to its simple fatty acid profile, the presence of only one major fatty acyl desaturase, and the appropriate redox chain in a suitable membrane  <cit> . the fatty acid analysis of the transformant yeast cells grown in galactose-containing medium showed the presence of a new fatty acid, which was not present either in the wild-type yeast or in the control cells transformed with the empty vector pyes <dig>  the new fatty acid was identified as linoleic acid  by gc-ms .

the low abundance of fad <dig> is a surprising contrast with the high level expression of fah <dig>  with  <dig> ests from the total of  <dig>  analyzed sequences. this difference in expression level was also confirmed by an rt-pcr analysis . since fad <dig> and fah <dig> act on the same substrate, 18:1-phosphatidylcholine  <cit> , a low level of fad <dig> expression may favor fah <dig> and thus result in a high level of ricinoleate accumulation in castor seeds. to test this idea, we over-expressed the castor fad <dig> in the cl <dig> arabidopsis line expressing the fah <dig> transgene. indeed, analysis of  <dig> cl37/fad <dig> plant lines demonstrated a negative correlation between levels of desaturation and hydroxylation. as shown in figure  <dig>  the oleate hydroxylation proportion  decreased as the oleate desaturation proportion /) increased. the hydroxy fatty acid content  is reduced from 17+/-1% in the cl <dig> parental line to less than 5% in the most-extreme fad <dig> transgenics . this effect is not likely a result of homologous co-suppression since castor fad <dig> and fah <dig> are only ~70% identical in nucleotide sequence. this result suggests that castor endosperm is highly specialized to ricinoleate synthesis through the evolution of fah <dig>  a member of the fad <dig> superfamily  <cit> . regulation of fad <dig> and fah <dig> expression in castor endosperm may contribute to high-level accumulation of ricinoleate in castor oils. in castor endosperm, expression of fad <dig> may be kept at minimum to maintain membrane lipid synthesis and normal cell functions. there may be also other fad <dig> homologs in castor that were not detectable in our est analyses since we used mrna from a specific stage of endosperm development. in addition, the fah <dig> enzyme has a low level of desaturation activity  <cit> . although this scenario may be true in castor endosperm, heterologous expression of fah <dig> in a fad2-deficient arabidopsis line  did not result in an increased level of hydroxy fatty acid accumulation in transgenic seeds  <cit> . other components in developing castor endosperm probably have co-evolved with the fah <dig> enzyme to facilitate hydroxy fatty acid synthesis and assembly into storage oils  <cit> . the search for such factors is an ongoing process in the authors' laboratories and will benefit from the cdna library and est analysis described here.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here an analysis of the ests derived from a full-length cdna library of castor developing endosperm. the ests are enriched in genes encoding storage proteins, ricin, oleosins, as well as other housekeeping cellular components such as those for protein synthesis. we identified two ests of the castor acidic tag lipases, which are abundantly expressed in developing castor endosperm. expression of these lipases did not increase ricinoleate accumulation in transgenic arabidopsis seeds. their function in castor developing seed remains unclear. in contrast to fah <dig>  fad <dig> is much lower in abundance in our cdna library, suggesting that regulation of fad <dig> and fah <dig> expression in castor endosperm may contribute to high-level accumulation of ricinoleate in castor oils, and our results in transgenic arabidopsis plants support this possibility.

a full-length cdna resource is particularly valuable for the correct annotation of genomic sequences and for the functional analysis of genes and their products  <cit> . recently, the institute for genomic research  has initiated a project to generate redundant sequence analysis of the castor genome . our results contribute to a better understanding of the castor plant at the genomic level, most especially for understanding seed metabolism. future est work will focus on subtractive or normalized cdna library material to expedite gene discovery and functional genomic studies. we will also include est analyses using mrna extracted from different stages of seed development. our ultimate goal is to identify genetic factors contributing to increased ricinoleate accumulation in seed oils, first in arabidopsis and ultimately in oilseed crops.
