BACKGROUND
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a simple model for understanding animal biology for nearly four decades. after the sequencing of entire genomes from several metazoans, we are now in an excellent position to take a gene-centric approach to the worm as a model organism. a majority of human genes have homologs in c. elegans. in a comparative proteomics study, 83% of the worm proteome was found to have human homologous genes  <cit> . only 11% or less contains nematode specific genes. this makes the worm a suitable model organism for delineating human gene function  <cit> .

in a previous study, all transmembrane protein families in the c. elegans genome were classified and the human orthologs identified  <cit> . predicted proteins with two or more membrane domains were clustered and for each cluster a multiple alignment was created. from the alignments, hmms  were built and subsequently used to search for mammalian homologs. the consensus of nine different phylogenetic methods and blast were used to assign orthology. this resulted in a total of  <dig> worm-human orthology assignments with a high confidence.

orthologs are sequences that arose from a common ancestor gene and were separated by a speciation event  <cit> . identification of orthologs is important, since they might share functionality. in closely related species, such as human and mouse, orthologs are normally trivial to find. however, when comparing distantly related species, e.g. human and worm, this is no longer the case because the similarity levels overall are low. instead, one needs to rely on sophisticated phylogenetic reconstruction techniques to infer whether two genes stem from a node that corresponds to a speciation split or to a duplication event within a lineage. close orthologs are likely to have the same biological role in the two organisms. distant orthologs on the other hand, are less likely to have the same phenotypical role, but may have the same role in the corresponding pathway. consequently, by studying true c. elegans orthologs to human genes experimentally in the worm, one can potentially learn more about the gene function also in humans. depending on whether duplication have occurred in one or both lineages since the speciation event, orthologs can form one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.

paralogs arise from a duplication event. a common scenario when genes are duplicated is that one of the gene copies is under negative selective pressure and therefore retains the function of the ancestor. the other copy might then be more free to evolve a new function different from the ancestral function. this is the reason why paralogs in different species are less likely to share functionality compared to orthologs. paralogs can be divided into two subtypes – outparalogs and inparalogs  <cit> . outparalogs are paralogs that evolved by gene duplications that happened before the speciation event and therefore they do not form orthologous relationships. inparalogs, on the other hand, form co-orthologous relationships, since they are paralogs that evolved by gene duplications that happened after the speciation event.

here we present an initial functional characterization in c. elegans of seventeen genes. the criteria for selecting these genes were that they are high confidence candidate orthologs to human genes  <cit>  and that their function is unknown. they are all predicted to encode transmembrane proteins, which imply that they could constitute as yet unknown receptors, channels or transporters playing important roles in various biological processes in multicellular organisms. we are particularly interested in studying those genes that might have a neuronal function. the phylogeny, membrane topology and domain organization were analyzed. gene function was explored experimentally in the worm by means of rna interference induced knock-down phenotypes and gene expression patterns.

RESULTS
membrane topology predictions
the consensus of nine different methods was used to predict membrane topologies for the putative c. elegans proteins, and two different methods were used to predict signal peptides . each predicting method has some margin of error; therefore the consensus from several different predictors is more likely to give a better estimate of the true topology. results were viewed using the sfinx tool  <cit> , an example of output can be seen in fig.  <dig>  the number of transmembrane  regions ranges between six and ten , with a majority of proteins having six or seven tm regions . such proteins are likely to be receptors, channels, or transporters. one case, however,  is likely to be an intramembrane protease.

 <dig> t28f <dig>  was initially included because of strong similarity to q92504; however, the phylogenetic analysis showed that it is probably an outparalog to the human gene.

phylogenetic analysis
the results from the phylogenetic analysis are presented in table  <dig>  the previous orthology assignments are still valid  <cit> , although for some c. elegans genes, additional human orthologs have emerged from the sequencing efforts. at present, 29%  of the worm genes have one-to-many ortholog relationship with human genes, which means that there has probably been an expansion in the human lineage. this is the case for c36b <dig>   and zk <dig>   . 53%  showed a one-to-one relationship with its human ortholog, for example sft- <dig>  . two of the worm genes, f40f <dig>   and f40f <dig>  , seem to have a many-to-many relationship . the phylogenetic tree in fig. 2b show somewhat inconclusive support for where the speciation event could have taken place. it is possible that the human gene q8ivw <dig> is also an ortholog to the two worm genes. to investigate the ortholog relationship further, orthostrapper was used  <cit> . orthostrapper analyzes a set of bootstrap trees instead of the optimal tree for orthologs. the algorithm detects orthologous relations between two  species. the frequency of orthology assignments in the bootstrap trees can be interpreted as a confidence value for the possible orthology of two proteins. orthology assignments in the optimal phylogenetic tree that might be incorrect can be identified by their low ortholog bootstrap value. this makes it possible to resolve complicated many-to-many orthologous relationships. when analyzing the multiple alignment for the phylogenetic tree in fig. 2b using orthostrapper, the results showed a stronger support for the human genes q9bwq <dig> and q969x <dig> to be the orthologs compared to q8ivw <dig> . it seems that the orthologous relationship in this particular case is complicated to elucidate. still, q9bwq <dig> and q969x <dig> are the best candidate human orthologs for the c. elegans genes f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig> .

h13n <dig>  and t28f <dig>  both show sequence similarity to the human gene q <dig>  however, the phylogenetic tree and results from orthostrapper , suggest that h13n <dig>  is the putative ortholog to q <dig>  whereas t28f <dig>  may be an outparalog.

the bootstrap support for the speciation node between t04a <dig>  and its human ortholog q9uhj <dig> barely made the cutoff of 50% when pam distances was used. with observed divergence and poisson correction as distance methods, the bootstrap support improved to 99% and 67%, respectively. when analyzing the phylogenetic tree using orthostrappper, there was a very strong support for this orthology assignment . therefore, we conclude that t04a <dig>  is probably the ortholog to q9uhj <dig> 

c30h <dig>  has three potential human orthologs, q9h6t <dig>  q9nxc <dig> and q96nn <dig>  the bootstrap support for the speciation node with pam distances was 57%. this improved to 87% and 88% with observed divergence and poisson correction, respectively. orthostrapper results showed a strong support for q9h6t <dig> and q9nxc <dig> as orthologs to c30h <dig>  , whereas the support for q96nn <dig> was weaker . considering these results, we believe that all three human genes are orthologs to the worm gene; however, the ortholog relationship seems to be weaker between q96nn <dig> and c30h <dig> .

putative domain assignments
the domain organization of the predicted proteins was analyzed using the pfam database  <cit>  . conclusions about possible functions cannot be drawn from the mere presence of a putative domain, although it can give some indication.

five of the proteins  may have a pf <dig> domain, which is annotated as being a zip domain. the zip family is believed to include zinc and other metal transporters. the zip proteins have been classified into four groups based on sequence conservation  <cit> ; the zip subfamily i and ii, the gufa subfamily and the liv- <dig> subfamily . the zip i subfamily contains mostly plant and yeast sequences; however, it also includes t01d <dig>  and its putative orthologs in drosophila melanogaster, mouse and human . the other four worm genes appear to belong to the liv- <dig> subfamily. this subfamily has a unique metalloprotease motif that raises the possibility that they might have protease activity  <cit> . within the liv- <dig> subfamily there is a subgroup called the ke <dig> group, to which h13n <dig>  and its human ortholog hke <dig>  belong.

c36b <dig>  was predicted to have a pf <dig> domain, a probable signal peptide peptidase  domain. spp catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of some signal peptides after they have been cleaved from a preprotein. this processing by spp is related to protein cleavage by presenilins. homologs to spp are divided into five subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis   <cit> . c36b <dig>  and its putative human orthologs q8tct <dig>  q8tct <dig> and q8iuh <dig> belong to the sppl <dig> subfamily. the members of subfamilies sppl1- <dig> only show homology to spp in the c-terminal half of the protein and in the n-terminus there is substantial variation. this suggests that the c-terminal part may constitute the proteolytic subdomain, whereas the n-terminus defines the specific function of the respective proteins.

f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig>  seem to have a pf <dig> domain , which is an uncharacterized protein family. both f08f <dig>  and zk <dig>  may belong to the pf <dig> domain family . proteins in this family might be located to endosomal membranes  <cit> . f14f <dig>  and r <dig>  were predicted to have a pf <dig> domain, which is annotated as a mboat  domain. biochemically characterized proteins of this group encode enzymes that transfer organic acids onto hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded targets  <cit> . sft- <dig> most likely has a pf <dig>  domain. members of this family are believed to encode integral membrane proteins located to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . a pf <dig> domain  was found in y6b3b. <dig>  this domain is associated with longevity in yeast . three of the seventeen putative proteins  do not match to any pfam-a domain.

rna interference studies
out of the seventeen genes studied, sft- <dig> and r <dig>  exhibited phenotypes when both the n <dig>  and the rnai sensitive rrf- <dig> ii  <cit>  strains were subjected to rnai by feeding . the phenotypes were enhanced with strain rrf- <dig>  although the dpy  phenotype seen for r <dig>  was still low penetrant and relatively weak. the lva  observed for sft- <dig> occurred at larval stages l2–l <dig> and there was an almost complete penetrance with the sensitive strain. the rnai phenotypes for both genes were detected at all temperatures, although, for sft- <dig> they were more severe at higher temperatures. the positive results were verified with rnai by injection in strain n <dig> 

analysis of gene expression
transcriptional fusions with gfp were established for fourteen genes and the resulting gene expression was analyzed. the results are presented in table  <dig>  because the arrays are extrachromosomal and not integrated; mosaic patterns of expression were observed. also, germ line expression could not be analyzed, due to germ line silencing. for 18%  of the genes no transgenic lines could be established despite several attempts, and out of the lines established, 14%  showed no expression. this could be due to several reasons . in half of the transgenic lines established, expression was found in more than three different tissues. the most prevalent major tissues of expression were hypodermis , nervous system and pharyngeal muscle  and intestine .

examples of gene expression patterns observed are presented in fig.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  c36b <dig>  shows expression restricted to head neurons and intestine . the intestinal expression was stronger during larval stages compared to the adult stage, and it was predominantly located to posterior intestinal nuclei. f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig>  demonstrate some overlapping expression in nervous system and pharyngeal muscle ; however, f40f <dig>  appear to be more widely expressed in the nervous system with expression in more neuronal cell bodies and in commissures and ventral nerve cord . expression of f40f <dig>  is also located to body wall muscle and hypodermal cells in the tail . f40f <dig>  is also expressed in the excretory system, although it is weaker compared to the other tissues . widespread expression patterns were observed for sft- <dig> and zk <dig>  both during larval and adult stages . for sft- <dig> it was highly mosaic with pharyngeal muscle as the most consistent tissue of expression.

putative function assignments
c36b <dig> 
the three putative human orthologs  to the c. elegans gene c36b <dig>  are thought to be presenilin-like  proteins . presenilins are an important group of proteases acting in the nervous system. abnormal proteolytic cleavage may result in accumulation of pathogenic insoluble proteins, implied in e.g. alzheimer's disease. we have shown that c36b <dig>  is probably expressed in head neurons and intestine; however, the intestinal expression might be ectopic , which would imply that the gene is exclusively expressed in neurons. this suggests that the three human orthologs may also encode neuronal functions.

the membrane topology of human proteins belonging to the presenilin-like family has been analyzed previously. q8iuh <dig> was predicted to have seven transmembrane  segments and a cytoplasmic c-terminus  <cit> , and the same was predicted for hm13_human   <cit> . however, it should be noted that although the number of tm segments of these predictions is the same, the topologies are in fact different. the fourth segment in the q8iuh <dig> prediction is missing from the hm13_human prediction, and the c-terminal segment in the hm13_human prediction is missing from the q8iuh <dig> prediction. this means that the four c-terminal tm segments are not in register between the predictions, and consequently the loops are on opposite sides. this includes the loop between the putatively catalytic aspartic acid residues also present in presenilins that was predicted cytoplasmic by ponting et al., and non-cytoplasmic by weihofen et al. because of the tm segment disagreement, these aspartic acid residues were predicted to be located in tm <dig> and tm <dig> in the ponting et al. prediction, but in tm <dig> and tm <dig> in the weihofen et al. prediction.

merging these two proposed topologies by accepting all tm segments predicted by one or the other study would yield a topology with nine tm segments. our own analysis of the proteins in question using the sfinx tool  <cit>  provides strong support for this topology, with the c-terminus in the cytoplasm . we therefore propose that both previous tm topologies had incorrectly left out one tm segment, which would correspond to segments  <dig> and  <dig> in the 9-tm segment model.

we further analyzed the other members of this family with sfinx  <cit> , and consistently found a 9-tm topology model with c-terminus in the cytoplasm. the conserved aspartic acid residues would be located in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  as an example, the sfinx output for c36b <dig>  and one of its human orthologs q8tct <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  the overall topology is very similar between the putative worm protein and all of its orthologs in both human and mouse, as well as the other presenilin-like proteins. one difference, however, is that c36b <dig>  and two of its human  and mouse orthologs  are predicted to have a n-terminal signal peptide, a feature that seems to be missing from the other presenilin-like proteins.

f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig> 
f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig>  are 48% identical to each other on the protein sequence level and they also appear to have similar membrane topologies. they are close in the genome , but on opposite strands. it has been shown that genes closer than  <dig> bp on opposite strands are likely to have a shared control region  <cit> , which means that these two genes might be coexpressed. the expression patterns observed are indeed overlapping, although not to a full extent . one of the human orthologs  identified has been shown to protect cells from fas-mediated cell death  <cit> , suggesting that f40f <dig>  and f40f <dig>  might be involved in apoptosis.

sft-4
the sft- <dig> gene  is highly conserved throughout evolution with orthologs in both vertebrates and non-vertebrates. all orthologous relationships are one-to-one with a high bootstrap support. the tree in fig. 2c indicates that there exists a worm homolog  to sft- <dig>  o <dig>  was found to be 33% identical to sft- <dig> on the protein sequence level and it was also predicted to have a pf <dig>  domain. however, our rnai screen indicates that there is no or little functional redundancy between the two genes, since sft- <dig> has a very strong rnai phenotype, showing an almost complete larval arrest at stages l2–l <dig>  the rnai phenotype for t02e <dig>  is wildtype according to previous studies  <cit> . our gene expression analysis revealed a wide spread expression of the reporter construct for sft- <dig> . taken together, these data suggests that sft- <dig> may play an essential role during development acting in many tissues.

zk <dig> 
zk <dig>  is most probably orthologous to the human genes q9nxl <dig> and q9y <dig> . the cgi- <dig> protein was found in a screen where novel human genes evolutionary conserved in c. elegans were identified  <cit> . the function of both cgi- <dig> and q9nxl <dig> is unknown. zk <dig>  has several worm homologs, one of which is sid- <dig> . sid- <dig> has been identified as a protein that is required for systemic rnai  <cit> . it was predicted to have eleven transmembrane  regions and some of them have been experimentally verified  <cit> . the high number of tm regions suggests that sid- <dig> forms a channel. double stranded rna is thought to diffuse through this channel, leading to spreading of the rna and hence, a systemic rnai effect. this idea is also supported by the fact that no homolog of sid- <dig> has been found in drosophila, which can explain the observed absence of systemic rnai in this organism  <cit> . our analysis of zk <dig>  predicts that it has ten tm regions, which makes it a likely candidate for forming a channel. the phylogenetic tree indicates that zk <dig>  is the best candidate ortholog to human genes q9nxl <dig> and q9y <dig>  whereas sid- <dig> is a probable outparalog to the human genes . the tree also supports the previous finding that there is no homolog to zk <dig>  or sid- <dig> in the drosophila genome. we have observed a wildtype rnai phenotype for zk <dig> , which is consistent with results from other studies  <cit> . further analysis might reveal if zk <dig>  also is involved in systemic rnai or if it has some other function. four additional genes required for systemic rnai have been reported   <cit> , but none of them map to locus zk <dig> .

c30h <dig> , h13n <dig> , t01d <dig> , t11f <dig>  and t28f <dig> 
slc39a <dig>  was identified as one of three possible human orthologs to c30h <dig> . the human gene has been implicated in the rare inherited condition acrodermatitis enteropathica, which results from a defect in the absorption of zinc  <cit> . it is believed that slc39a <dig> might encode a zinc transporter responsible for intestinal absorption of zinc. therefore, c30h <dig>  may also be a zinc/metal transporter.

the predicted human ortholog  to h13n <dig>  in c. elegans has been shown to be a zinc transporter localized to intracellular membranes  <cit> . q <dig> probably transports zinc out of the endoplasmic reticulum and other intracellular stores. the drosophila ortholog to h13n <dig>  is catsup , which encodes a negative regulator of tyrosine hydroxylase  activity  <cit> . th is a rate-limiting enzyme for production of dopamine in the brain. the arabidopsis thaliana gene iar <dig>  is also an ortholog to h13n <dig> . it is proposed to be involved in auxin metabolism or response  <cit> . interestingly, the mouse ortholog  to h13n <dig>  and iar <dig> was shown to functionally substitute for the arabidopsis gene. these data indicate that there is functional conservation among these orthologs and it is likely that h13n <dig> , and possibly also t28f <dig> , could play similar roles in the corresponding pathways in the worm.

bigm <dig>  was identified as one of four candidate human orthologs to t11f <dig> . the human gene was found to be induced during the infection and inflammatory response. it was also shown to play a role in intracellular zinc ion accumulation and retention  <cit> . consequently, it is possible that t11f <dig>  might be an integral membrane zinc/metal transporter.

the human ortholog to t01d <dig>  has no known putative function. we observed a wildtype rnai phenotype for t01d <dig>  as well as for the other four pf <dig>  domain containing putative proteins . this indicates that there might be some functional redundancy between these genes. considering the information available, it is conceivable that t01d <dig>  may also be a zinc/metal transporter.

f08f <dig> , t04a <dig>  and zk <dig> 
f08f <dig>  and zk <dig>  show 47% identity on the protein sequence level and they have similar membrane topologies with a large n-terminal non-cytoplasmic region and nine transmembrane regions in the c-terminal part. f08f <dig>  and one of the splice variants of zk <dig>  were predicted to have a n-terminal signal peptide. the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the human gene p <dig>  is the ortholog to f08f <dig>  and it appears to localize to endosomes  <cit> . the function of the probable human ortholog  to zk <dig>  is unknown.

both f08f <dig>  and zk <dig>  are predicted to be in operons, as is t04a <dig>   <cit> . f08f <dig>  is probably in an operon with tth- <dig> . tth- <dig> is likely to belong to the pf <dig> domain family , which includes actin-binding proteins, implicating a possible role in cytoskeleton organization. zk <dig>  is predicted to be in an operon with zk <dig>   and zk <dig>  . a pf <dig>  domain with unknown function is likely to be present in zk <dig> . zk <dig>  might have a pf <dig> domain , suggesting that it could be involved in translation. t04a <dig>  may be in an operon with t04a <dig>   and t04a <dig>  . t04a <dig>  might be a ribosomal protein, since it appears to have a pf <dig>  domain. t04a <dig>  was predicted to have a pf <dig>  domain, which is known for forming structural complexes with other proteins. there are no matching pfam-a domains for t04a <dig> . the best candidate human ortholog to t04a <dig>  is frag <dig> . frag <dig> seems to be ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues and it has also been detected in several human tumor cell lines  <cit> . our results from the gene expression analysis demonstrated that f08f <dig>  is probably expressed in several tissues in c. elegans, suggesting an important biological role. previous studies have shown that the human ortholog p <dig>  is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . there was no expression observed for zk <dig>  and for gene t04a <dig> , we failed to generate a transgenic line. all three genes exhibited a wildtype rnai phenotype. for f08f <dig>  and zk <dig> , the wildtype phenotype could possibly be explained by functional redundancy between the two genes and a third c. elegans emp <dig> domain containing protein y41d4a. <dig> . we found that y41d4a. <dig> is homologous to f08f <dig>  and zk <dig> , and most likely an ortholog to the human gene q9hd <dig>  taken together, these findings point to that f08f <dig> , zk <dig>  and t04a <dig>  might play fundamental biological roles, and that they may be involved in processes such as cellular organization  and translation .

f14f <dig>  and r <dig> 
the human genes q <dig>  and q96n <dig> are probable orthologs to f14f <dig> . bb <dig> has been shown to be overexpressed in breast and bladder carcinoma  <cit> , suggesting that it might have a role in tumor progression. the function of q96n <dig> is unknown.

the likely drosophila ortholog to r <dig>  is nessy , a putative hox gene target  <cit> , indicating a possible developmental role. the dpy  rnai phenotype detected for r <dig>  could be due to some developmental/body size regulatory error in possibly the hypodermis and/or body wall muscle; tissues in which the gene is expressed according to our analysis. the best human ortholog candidate  to r <dig>  has not yet been functionally characterized.

y6b3b.10
y6b3b. <dig> is most probably orthologous to the human gene p <dig> and they both seem to belong to the pf <dig>  domain family. lag <dig> is a longevity gene that was cloned from yeast  <cit> . members of the lag <dig> family are thought to be involved in determining lifespan. however, the phylogenetic tree revealed that y6b3b. <dig> and its human and mouse ortholog  form a tight cluster in the tree, separated from the other lag <dig> domain containing proteins, indicating that they may have evolved a slightly different function. y6b3b. <dig> showed a wildtype rnai phenotype and it appears to have an expression restricted to the pharyngeal muscle.

d <dig> 
d <dig>  is orthologous to q <dig> , q8k1a <dig>  and q9vx <dig> . neither of these genes has any putative function assigned to them and they have no matching pfam-a domains. d <dig>  is expressed in several tissues in c. elegans and it exhibits a wildtype rnai phenotype.

discussion
this study illustrates how bioinformatic and experimental analysis can be combined to elucidate putative gene function. we have predicted worm-human orthologs and performed an initial functional characterization of the worm genes. since orthologs are likely to have the same biological function, a better understanding of the function of the human genes can be accomplished through analysis in c. elegans. the genes explored in this study were selected from a previous study  <cit>  and they are all predicted to encode transmembrane proteins. such proteins are attractive to study since many interesting receptors, channels, transporters and signaling proteins are found among them, making them likely to be involved in important regulatory processes in multicellular organisms.

the number of transmembrane  regions predicted for each protein, is similar to the number predicted for each cluster of putative tm proteins from the former study   <cit> . for the putative proteins h13n <dig> , f14f <dig>  and zk <dig> , however, the difference is larger . this divergence could be due to remm and sonnhammer having performed predictions on a cluster and not on individual genes. in addition, they used only the program tmhmm  <cit>  for analyzing membrane topology. tmhmm, when using default settings, may miss weak tm regions, leading to a possible underestimation of the number of tm segments. a better estimate of the true topology can be achieved through the use of several different prediction programs. in this study, we used the consensus of nine different methods provided by the sfinx tool  <cit>  to assign membrane topology.

we observed an rnai phenotype for  <dig> %  of the genes when using both strains n <dig>  and rrf- <dig> , respectively. this is in agreement with previous experiments, where  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  phenotypes have been detected  <cit> . the rnai phenotypes for sft- <dig> are consistent with previous results  <cit> . however, the two groups have reported non-overlapping phenotypes, but in this screen we have observed all of them. the lva  phenotype has also been reported from the genome wide screen using strain rrf- <dig>  <cit> . the dpy  phenotype for r <dig>  has not been reported before. the gene was downregulated using rnai by injection in a screen of chromosome iii  <cit>  and the phenotype was found to be wildtype. however, the focus of that analysis was to identify genes involved in cell division and therefore only a few post-embryonic phenotypes were scored. the dpy phenotype observed is also low penetrant and relatively weak and could therefore be missed. furthermore, differences in results from rnai screens have been shown to exist. a 10–30% difference between experiments done in both different and in the same laboratories has been reported  <cit> .

when analyzing expression patterns using transcriptional reporter fusions, one issue of concern is whether the pattern observed is the expression pattern of the native gene or not. ectopic or lack of expression can occur if the putative promoter used does not include all the regulatory elements. expression in several different cell types in the pharynx and in the posterior intestinal cells of young animals has been attributed to the use of incomplete promoters  <cit> . another limitation when using extrachromosomal arrays is that analysis of expression in the germ line is not possible, due to germ line silencing.

the putative promoter used in the transcriptional fusion for c36b <dig>  is only  <dig> kb, due to the presence of an upstream gene. therefore, it is possible that the intestinal expression seen predominantly in young worms and mostly located to posterior intestinal nuclei, is an artifact of the use of an incomplete promoter region  <cit> . if this is the case, c36b <dig>  might be expressed exclusively in neurons in the head . this finding provides support to the idea that c36b <dig>  and its three human orthologs encode neuronal functions. a possible consequence of this could be that they act in a fashion analogous to presenilin, or even that they could be involved in β-amyloid precursor protein processing. it would be interesting to study their role in nervous system development and function, and whether they are linked to neurological disorders

the transcriptional fusion for t28f <dig>  also showed a similar intestinal expression, apart from the specific expression in neurons in the head, ventral nerve cord, vulva and a weak expression in hypodermis. the putative promoter region used is only  <dig>  kb, due to the presence of an upstream gene. thus, the intestinal expression seen for t28f <dig>  may once again be related to the use of an incomplete promoter region  <cit> .

two of the transcriptional fusions  showed no expression of the reporter gene. this is unlikely due to the use of an incomplete promoter region, since the upstream region included was  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. instead, it might be caused by conditional gene expression, germline silencing or absence of the promoter::gfp fusion from the inheritable extrachromosomal array  <cit> . for three of the genes in this study we failed to establish transgenic lines. possible reasons for this could be that the injected dna concentration was too low or that the sequence was toxic. in either case, the extrachromosomal array formed may not have been sufficiently large to be inheritable  <cit> .

out of the seventeen genes in this study, three are predicted to be in operons . this is equivalent to the number of genes in the c. elegans genome that are believed to be in operons . whether c. elegans operons contain genes of related function or not is still unknown. there are, however, some indications that genes encoding proteins of fundamental biological importance might be clustered into operons. for example, genes for mitochondrial proteins have a strong tendency to be together in operons and also genes encoding splicing proteins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shed some light upon the putative function of a few predicted worm-human orthologs. our aim was to identify genes that could play a role in the nervous system and indeed we have been able to find eight genes that appear to be expressed in neurons. c. elegans is an excellent model organism for pursuing the functional characterization of these genes, considering its well mapped and relatively sophisticated nervous system. investigating the function of orthologous proteins using a simple multicellular organism is a suitable approach for the possibility of learning more about the function of a gene not only in one species but also hopefully in several. this approach becomes even more valid as several genomes are being sequenced at the moment with additional ones already in the pipeline. with the enormous amount of data that these sequencing efforts are generating, it is very useful to be able to start delineating the gene function based on functional characterization of the ortholog in another species, before initiating studies in more complex organisms.
