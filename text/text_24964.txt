BACKGROUND
many of the transcription factors important in pancreas development are, or are thought to act as, repressors of target genes. for example, nkx2- <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor in the developing neural tube  <cit>  and represses ghrelin cell specification during pancreas development  <cit> . pax <dig> represses the α-cell transcription factor arx, which in turn represses pax <dig> expression  <cit> . during pancreas development nkx6- <dig> acts as a context dependent transcriptional activator or repressor, activating its own transcription while more broadly repressing gene expression  <cit> . nkx6- <dig> is a repressor of dbx <dig> in neuronal development  <cit> . in each of these cases, both in the pancreas and in neuronal development, transcription factor mediated repression of target genes requires the recruitment of cofactors. for many of these transcription factors homologs of groucho, called the groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split  family, fulfill this role  <cit> .

in drosophila groucho  acts as a master repressor  <cit>  and regulates transcriptional repression through interactions with hairy, hairy related, and runt family proteins via a wrpw/y motif, as well as with dorsal, engrailed, and tcf family proteins via an unrelated eh <dig>  motif  <cit> . evidence suggests that gro recruits histone deacetylases  that modify the local chromosomal state, silencing gene transcription. there are at least six mouse homologs of gro , which all have direct human orthologs. tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are full-length gro subfamily members containing a highly conserved wd-repeat domain at their carboxy termini and a glutamine rich  domain at their amino terminal end. linking these domains is a weakly conserved central region. tle <dig> , that lacks much of the central region and the wd-repeat domain, acts as a dominant negative repressor of gro subfamily members  <cit> .

it has been reported that tle <dig> and tle <dig> have non-overlapping expression patterns in the brain and spinal cord, while tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were shown to be differentially expressed in in vitro models of neural and chondrocytic determination  <cit> . later studies showed that tle1- <dig> have unique but overlapping expression patterns, with the overlaps occurring in putative precursor populations  <cit> . these results imply that each member of the gro/tle family has unique functions in specific cell types, despite the fact they may have similar promiscuous binding affinities for numerous wrpw/y and eh <dig> motif containing proteins, and possibly redundant functions in progenitor cell types.

numerous studies have begun to dissect the roles of the gro/tle family members in various developmental systems. to date, gro/tle mediated repression has been implicated in pituitary and kidney organogenesis, hematopoiesis, and development of both bone and the eye  <cit> . these studies have revealed a number of pathways and transcriptional repressors utilizing gro/tle proteins. for example, all tcf hmg box transcription factors interact with tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and repress transactivation in a β-catenin -tcf reporter gene assay, suggesting a role for the gro/tle proteins in wnt signaling  <cit> . in addition, foxa <dig>  has been shown to interact with tle <dig> in hela and hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . the majority of work, however, has focused on understanding the function of the mammalian gro/tle proteins in neuronal development. notch signaling acts to restrict the neural potential of progenitors by antagonizing expression of pro-neural genes. both tle <dig> and tle <dig> interact directly with hes <dig> and are vital to it's repressive abilities  <cit> . tle <dig> also interacts with bf- <dig> , a regulator of neuronal differentiation  <cit> , mediating the interaction between bf- <dig> and hes <dig>  <cit> . several homeodomain transcription factors  important in pancreas development are also essential to patterning neuronal specification in the ventral neural tube and interact with gro/tle proteins  <cit> . a cross-repressive model whereby these transcription factors repress genes involved in the specification of opposing cell types has been proposed  <cit> . the gro/tle family members are a vital component of this model and ectopic expression of tle <dig>  a dominant negative inhibitor of gro/tle mediated repression, perturbs neural tube patterning by extending the expression domains of both nkx2- <dig> and nkx6- <dig>  <cit> .

in this work we describe the expression of gro/tle family members utilizing nine sage libraries created from the developing and adult pancreas. additionally we identify, and assess the expression of,  <dig> different transcription factors that contain a gro/tle interaction motif in these libraries, and further demonstrate that at least  <dig> of these are expressed in the endocrine lineage. we then show the dynamic expression of tle <dig> through  <dig> during pancreas development by qrt-pcr. the cell-type specificity of tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> expression was assessed using ihc to co-localize each with pdx <dig> at e <dig> , ngn <dig> at e <dig> , pdx <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin at e <dig> , and insulin and glucagon in the adult. we then focus on tle <dig>  as it was expressed widely in endocrine pancreas development, and show that it can interact with nkx2- <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  hes <dig> and arx which are all essential in proper endocrine pancreas development. finally, we demonstrate that tle <dig> can modulate the repressive abilities of arx and that this modulation is dependent upon arx's gro/tle interaction domain.

RESULTS
identification of gro/tle proteins and putative gro/tle interacting proteins in the developing pancreas
we first assessed the expression of the gro/tle family members in nine serial analysis of gene expression  libraries generated from the developing and adult pancreas  <cit> . this data revealed the differential expression of tle <dig> through tle <dig>  with high levels of both tle <dig> and tle <dig>  at various stages of pancreas development . no tags unambiguously map to tle <dig> so it could not be assessed. since the gro/tle proteins interact with transcription factors containing an eh <dig> or wrpw/y domain we assessed the expression of the  <dig> factors present in our pancreas sage libraries. included in this group are several factors essential for proper endocrine cell specification and maturation such as hes <dig>  foxa <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  and pou3f <dig>  . arx and nkx6- <dig>  which are essential to proper α- and β-cell development respectively, and contain an eh <dig> domain, could not be detected as arx does not produce an unambiguous tag while nkx6- <dig> does not contain a nlaiii site and thus does not produce a sage tag.

Φ tag position is calculated by assigning the 3' most catg in the transcript as the position  <dig> tag and the next 3' most catg the position  <dig> tag etc.

*tags counts are shown as tags per hundred thousand. this indicates the total number of times a given sage tag appears in the library per hundred thousand tags and is used to normalize for libraries of varying size

□ s is the specificity of the tag. specificity is calculated as described in the materials and methods.

*no unambiguous tags exist for nkx6- <dig> or arx although their expression within the pancreas is well established.

we then used the genepaint  database to assess the staining patterns of these genes in the e <dig>  pancreas. tle  <dig> and  <dig> both showed modest staining throughout the epithelium and mesenchyme, while tle <dig> staining was found predominantly in the mesenchyme . expression of tle <dig> could not be detected at this time point in the pancreas. tle <dig> and  <dig> on the other hand showed strong staining throughout the pancreas epithelium. informative stain was obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factors containing an eh <dig> or wrpw/y domain detected in our sage libraries and  <dig> of these showed stain in the pancreas . the remaining  <dig> factors for which informative staining was produced but no stain was seen in the pancreas typically showed counts only in the pdx <dig> gfp+ libraries or the e <dig>  ngn <dig> gfp-, including foxa <dig>  foxc <dig>  pax <dig>  pax <dig>  and tbx <dig>  or in libraries representing later developmental stages, including foxd <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  tbx <dig>  and tlx <dig>  data from the literature also provided evidence of the expression of an additional four of these factors, including hes <dig>  <cit> , hlxb <dig>  <cit> , nkx6- <dig>  <cit> , and nkx6- <dig>  <cit> , which are not in the genepaint database. thus, in addition to our sage data, there is independent evidence demonstrating the expression of thirteen different eh <dig> or wrpw/y transcription factors , many of which have well established roles in endocrine pancreas development.

qrt-pcr analysis of gro/tle genes in pancreas development
to determine the overall expression profiles of these genes in pancreas development we assessed their expression by qrt-pcr from e <dig>  through to adult islets . the expression profiles of tle <dig> and tle <dig> were highly similar, and transcripts for both generally became more abundant as development progressed with peak expression in the adult islets. tle <dig> expression dropped from e <dig>  to e <dig>  and was increased again at e <dig>  and in adult islets. tle <dig> expression also dropped at e <dig>  and stayed low at the remaining time points analyzed, although levels in the adult islets were higher than those found at e <dig>  to e <dig> . tle <dig> expression increased in abundance with development and highest levels were found in adult islets. tle <dig> expression was almost inverted compared with the tle <dig> and tle <dig> profiles, with peak expression at e <dig>  and relatively low levels in the islet and e <dig>  samples.

expression of gro/tle proteins at the start of the secondary transition
to determine the cell type specificities of tle1- <dig> we first analyzed their co-expression with pdx <dig>  whose expression marks the first appearance of cells capable of giving rise to the endocrine and exocrine pancreas as well as the duodenum  <cit>  . it was not possible to obtain tle <dig> or tle <dig> protein expression data since there are currently no suitable antibodies for these proteins. at this time point  tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were expressed throughout the pancreatic epithelium and all pdx <dig> positive cells were also positive for these three gro/tle proteins. a few tle <dig> and tle <dig> positive cells in the pancreatic epithelium were pdx <dig> negative. these cells likely correspond to cells that have undergone early differentiation into glucagon positive cells. tle <dig> was absent from the pancreatic epithelium and did not co-localize with pdx <dig>  all four of these gro/tle proteins were expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the developing pancreas, with tle <dig> and tle <dig> expressed in a few such cells, while tle <dig> and tle <dig> were widely expressed.

expression of gro/tle proteins at the end of the secondary transition
during the secondary transition endocrine progenitors lose expression of notch signaling components, such as hes <dig>  and begin to express the bhlh factor ngn <dig>  in neuronal development tle <dig> expression is likewise lost during neural specification of progenitors. to see if a similar process occurs in the pancreas we co-localized tle1- <dig> with ngn <dig> in the e <dig>  developing pancreas. unlike at e <dig>  where tle1- <dig> were expressed throughout the pancreatic epithelium these factors clearly showed more restricted expression at e <dig>  . at this time point tle <dig> was absent from the pancreatic epithelium. tle <dig> and tle <dig> on the other hand both showed scattered expression through the epithelium. also, both tle <dig> and tle <dig> co-localized with ngn <dig> in a subset of ngn <dig> positive cells. interestingly, cells that were ngn <dig> and tle <dig> or tle <dig> double positive, cells that were ngn <dig> positive and tle <dig> and tle <dig> negative, and cells that were ngn <dig> negative and tle <dig> and tle <dig> positive, were found . tle <dig> was again absent from epithelial cells. tle <dig> was only found in a restricted set of mesenchymal cells as observed at e <dig> , while tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were widely expressed in the mesenchyme.

oy implies the indicated cell type was found, n indicates the cell type was not found

expression of gro/tle proteins at e <dig> , after the secondary transition
beyond being implicated in controlling progenitor cell maintenance, gro/tle proteins also play a role in the maturation of a wide variety of specialized cell types. as previously mentioned many of the transcription factors that play significant roles in proper endocrine cell specification and maturation contain a gro/tle interaction domain. to determine which gro/tle family members are co-expressed with, and thus might interact with, these factors we co-localized the expression of tle <dig> through  <dig> with pdx <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin, which between them mark the four predominant endocrine cell types in the pancreas, at e <dig> .

tle <dig> was found only in a few endocrine cells and its expression partially over-lapped only with pdx <dig>  which at this time point is restricted to β and δ cells. tle <dig> expression was not seen in either insulin or glucagon positive cells. however it was found in cells that stained for the δ cell marker somatostatin as well as in cells that stained for pancreatic polypeptide  . tle <dig> was abundant in endocrine cells and all pdx <dig> and nkx2- <dig> positive cells were also tle <dig> positive. tle <dig> was also found in insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pp positive cells. tle <dig> was nearly as broadly expressed as tle <dig> and was found in all pdx <dig> positive cells, and most nkx2- <dig> positive cells. tle <dig> was also found in insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin positive cells but not in pp positive cells. tle <dig> was found in rare endocrine cells, none of which expressed pdx <dig> or nkx2- <dig>  tle <dig> was also not found in insulin, glucagon, pp, or somatostatin positive cells . a summary of these results can be found in table  <dig> 

oy implies the indicated cell type was found, n indicates the cell type was not found

expression of gro/tle proteins in the adult
our qrt-pcr data suggests that the expression of tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> peaks in the adult islets, while expression of tle <dig> is almost as high as seen at e <dig> . to determine if these genes show cell type specificity of expression within adult islets we next co-localized them with insulin and glucagon. tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expression was quite broad within islets cell types, although tle <dig> staining was noticeably weaker. each of these proteins co-localized with insulin in the majority of insulin positive cells. however, in each case a number of cells positive only for insulin were identified . all of the glucagon positive cells were also tle <dig> and tle <dig> positive . the majority of glucagon positive cells were also tle <dig> and/or tle <dig> positive. thus clearly tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in both of the major hormone producing cell types in the islet . to characterize the insulin or glucagon positive gro/tle negative cells further we co-localized the gro/tle's using a pan-tle antibody with pcna, a marker of proliferating cells. all pcna positive cells showed no or very weak gro/tle staining. several gro/tle negative pcna negative cells were also identified. we also assessed the co-localization of tle <dig> through  <dig> with dolichos biflorus agglutinin  that marks ductal cells . only tle <dig> and tle <dig> were found in dba positive cells. in acinar cells expression of all four of the tle proteins was found, although tle <dig> was present in only a very few cells.

oy implies the indicated cell type was found, n indicates the cell type was not found

interactions between tle <dig> and transcription factors essential to proper pancreas development
based on our expression profiling results tle <dig> and tle <dig> are the most likely candidates to be functional co-repressors for critical endocrine cell transcriptional repressors such as nkx2- <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  and others. in support of this, tle <dig> interacts with nkx2- <dig> in the pancreas  <cit>  and knocking in a mutant nkx2- <dig> containing the activation domain but not the gro/tle interaction domain produces a phenotype similar to the nkx2- <dig> knock out  <cit>  demonstrating that this domain is critical to proper nkx2- <dig> function. however, the transcription factors that tle <dig> interacts with in the developing pancreas are not known. thus to determine if tle <dig> interacts with transcription factors critical to key stages in pancreas development we used co-immunoprecipitation in the min <dig> β-cell line. we first attempted to determine if tle <dig>  like tle <dig>  can interact with nkx2- <dig> that is essential for the proper specification and maturation of α, β, and pp cells. anti-nkx2- <dig> blots of material immunoprecipitated using an anti-tle <dig> antibody produced an ~ <dig> kda band that was not seen in controls  but was found in western blots of whole cell lysate . nkx6- <dig> has, like nkx2- <dig>  been shown to interact with tle <dig> in in vitro binding assays  <cit> . nkx6- <dig> is critical for proper β-cell development and is known to act generally as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . we therefore wanted to determine if tle <dig> could interact with nkx6- <dig>  anti-tle <dig> blots of material immunoprecipitated using an anti-tle <dig> antibody produced an ~ <dig> kda band that was not seen in controls but was found in western blots of whole cell lysate . interestingly, the expected  <dig> kda nkx6- <dig> band could only be detected in the western blot  <cit> . next, we attempted to determine if tle <dig> interacts with hes <dig>  a critical mediator of notch signaling in pancreas development  <cit> , which controls pancreas progenitor maintenance and specification  <cit> . anti-tle <dig> blots of material immunoprecipitated using an anti-hes <dig> antibody produced an ~ <dig> kda band . recently arx was shown to have the ability to convert both mature and developing β-cells into cells with an β-cell phenotype  <cit> . since it interacts with tle <dig>  <cit>  we attempted to determine if it also interacts with tle <dig>  as arx is not normally expressed in β-cells we co-transfected a 6xhis tagged arx expression vector with a flag tagged tle <dig> expression vector. anti-his blots of material immunoprecipitated using an anti-tle <dig> antibody produced an ~ <dig> kda band that was not seen in controls but was found in western blots of whole cell lysate . in sum these results indicate that tle <dig> can interact with nkx2- <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  hes <dig>  and arx.

since arx is able to convert mature β-cells into cells with an α-cell phenotype, we hypothesized that gro/tle-arx interactions might be important to this ability. to assess this possibility we used a rat insulin promoter  reporter driving the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein . transfection of the rip-egfp reporter with a tle <dig> expression vector modestly reduced the green fluorescence intensity . however, transfection of the rip-egfp reporter with an arx expression vector resulted in a 43%  reduction in the mean green fluorescence intensity produced by the reporter as compared to transfection with the empty vector. co-transfection of arx with tle <dig> resulted in a 61%  reduction in the mean green fluorescent intensity produced by the reporter as compared to transfection with empty vector, a significant reduction from transfection with arx alone . transfection with a Δeh <dig> arx construct, which lacks the gro/tle interaction domain, resulted in a modest repression of the mean green fluorescence and co-transfection of this vector with the tle <dig> vector did not alter the level of repression seen.

discussion
our qrt-pcr and ihc data indicate that the gro/tle proteins are expressed throughout pancreas development and suggest that they may act at multiple stages of pancreas development. interestingly, we see the expression of all four gro/tle factors in the pancreatic mesenchyme. in our genepaint analysis we identified two transcription factors with a gro/tle interaction domain expressed in the mesenchyme, nkx2- <dig> and tcf <dig>  tcf <dig> can interact with gro/tle proteins  <cit>  although the significance of these, and any interactions between nkx2- <dig> and gro/tle proteins, in the pancreatic mesenchyme remains to be elucidated. tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were expressed throughout the epithelium in the pancreas prior to the secondary transition, while at e <dig>  only tle <dig> and tle <dig> were broadly expressed in the various developing endocrine cell types. we identified  <dig> different transcription factors also expressed in the endocrine lineage that contain gro/tle interaction domains. many of these factors have known roles in pancreas development including hes <dig> that is essential for proper endocrine specification, as well as foxa <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  and pou3f <dig>  that are essential for proper endocrine cell maturation. the presence of these putative interacting transcription factors that are essential to various steps of pancreas development in our sage libraries further supports our hypothesis that the gro/tle proteins play a role during multiple phases of pancreas development.

at the initiation of pancreas development  pancreatic epithelial precursor cells express pdx <dig>  although scattered pdx <dig> negative glucagon positive cells can be found. the co-expression of tle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at e <dig>  agrees with previous studies indicating that gro/tle expression overlaps in progenitor cell populations in other tissues. during neuronal development it has been suggested the primary role of the gro/tle factors is to maintain cells in the progenitor state through interactions with hes <dig>  <cit> , and they likely play this same role in the pancreas at this time.

the differentiation of pancreatic progenitors into the various endocrine precursor cell types is under the control of notch signaling, via lateral inhibition  <cit> . during this phase of pancreas development , called the secondary transition, committed endocrine progenitor cells are defined by their expression of neurogenin  <dig>   <cit>  whose expression is otherwise repressed by hes <dig>  <cit> . at this time point we identified ngn <dig> negative tle2/ <dig> positive cells that likely represent duct cell precursors generated from pancreatic progenitors in which active notch signaling has repressed ngn <dig> activation. in addition, we find ngn <dig> tle2/ <dig> double positive cells that showed generally dim ngn <dig> staining, suggestive of precursors in which an endocrine fate has yet to be fully established. last we find ngn <dig> bright cells that are tle2/ <dig> negative and likely represent committed endocrine precursors. as tle <dig> and tle <dig> are not expressed in the epithelium at this time, these cells represent cells in which none of the traditional gro/tle co-repressor factors are present, indicating that the belief that these factors are ubiquitous throughout pancreas development is incorrect. regardless, the wide expression of tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> prior to the secondary transition, and the obvious disappearance of tle <dig> and tle <dig> with concomitant appearance of ngn <dig>  suggests that these factors play a role in notch mediated lateral inhibition. our demonstration that tle <dig> can interact with hes <dig> in pancreas cells, as it does in neural development  <cit> , provides additional support for this hypothesis.

by e <dig>  tle <dig> and tle <dig> expression are clearly reactivated and both were expressed broadly in endocrine cell types, in agreement with our qrt-pcr data. our e <dig>  co-localization data showed that tle <dig> is expressed in pdx <dig> , nkx2- <dig> , pp, and somatostatin positive cells, but not in insulin or glucagon positive cells suggesting that it is expressed in δ and pp cell types, but not in α or β cells. tle <dig> co-localized with all the markers tested, indicating that is expressed in α, β, δ and pp cell types. tle <dig> co-localized with all of the markers tested with the exception of pp, and in agreement with this, nkx2- <dig> positive tle <dig> negative cells were found, indicating that tle <dig> is expressed in α, β, and δ cell types but not in pp cells. tle <dig> was the least abundant of the four gro/tle family members assessed and co-localized with none of the markers tested suggesting tle <dig> may be expressed specifically in ghrelin producing ε cells, although this remains to be confirmed.

the obvious co-expression of the gro/tle proteins in islet cells, as was found in pancreatic progenitors at e <dig> , is intriguing. also of interest is the presence of rare gro/tle negative, insulin positive cells. gro/tle proteins have been implicated in controlling the cell cycle  <cit>  and we show that some of these gro/tle negative cells represent replicating β-cells. the expression and roles of these factors in ductal and acinar cells is also of interest. it is clear that more work needs to be done to further assess the roles of these factors in these cell types.

in general our ihc data agree with the relative expression levels identified by qrt-pcr. in the qrt-pcr data, expression of tle <dig> and  <dig> increased with development. at first glance this may seem in disagreement with the ihc data that indicates these factors decrease in expression in the epithelium. however, it is worth noting that they are still widely expressed in the surrounding mesenchyme. tle <dig>  on the other hand, was not expressed widely in the mesenchyme and its expression clearly does drop at e <dig>  to e <dig>  and is then reactivated at e <dig> , as was found in the ihc data. expression of all four of the gro/tle family members analyzed here was relatively high in the adult islets, again in agreement with the ihc data. interestingly, the qrt-pcr expression profiles of tle1-tle <dig> are quite different from that of tle <dig> and  <dig>  additionally from our genepaint analysis tle <dig> and tle <dig> are both abundantly expressed throughout the pancreatic epithelium at e <dig> . it is striking to note that these data suggest that tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are being shut off in ngn <dig> positive endocrine precursors at roughly this time point. tle <dig> is a dominant negative repressor of tle1-tle <dig>  <cit> . likewise in neuronal development tle <dig>  antagonizes tle <dig> interactions with bf- <dig> inhibiting bf- <dig> target gene repression and inducing neural progenitors to differentiate  <cit> . it is therefore likely these factors are acting to limit or prevent gro/tle mediated target repression during pancreas development and our expression data suggests this may play an important role during the secondary transition.

arx can repress pax <dig>  <cit>  and likely other β-cell specification genes and convert β-cells and β-cell progenitors into cells with an α-cell phenotype  <cit> . as this effect includes the loss of insulin expression we used a rat promoter insulin reporter construct to determine if arx mediated repression of β-cell transcripts is gro/tle dependent. we found that co-expression of arx and tle <dig> enhanced repression of the insulin reporter as compared to arx alone. however, this repression was not seen using an arx construct lacking the eh <dig> domain. these data suggest that the repression of β-cell transcripts by arx, which in turn leads to the repression of insulin and other genes characteristic of β-cells, is at least in part gro/tle dependent.

our results agree with studies on neuronal development that have defined a dual role for gro/tle factors in first controlling the differentiation of progenitor cell types and then later in the specification and maturation of specific cell types  <cit> . our co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrates that tle <dig> is able to interact with nkx2- <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  hes <dig> and arx, which are key controllers of endocrine cell specification and maturation. further our ihc data indicates that tle <dig> and tle <dig>  in particular, co-localize with these factors in pancreas development suggesting these interactions occur in vivo. based on our results we propose a model for gro/tle action in the developing pancreas . in this model tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> initially play a redundant role in enacting the repression of hes <dig> target genes, such as ngn <dig>  thereby maintaining the cells in a progenitor state. in cells that begin to express higher ngn <dig> levels, hes <dig> expression is lost and cells differentiate into multipotent endocrine progenitors. subsequently tripotent α/β/ε precursors develop into an ε  precursor or an α/β bipotent precursor based on repression of the ε cell fate by nkx2- <dig>  <cit> . experimental evidence has demonstrated that gro/tle interactions are critical to this process and both tle <dig> and  <dig> are co-expressed with nkx2- <dig> and can interact with it  <cit> . subsequently, α/β-cell precursors undergo α or β cell specification wherein we hypothesize that pro-β-cell eh <dig> motif containing factors repress α-cell activating factors while pro-α-cell eh <dig> motif containing factors repress α-cell activating factors, several of which do so in a putatively gro/tle dependent fashion. the specific targets of these genes, in general, are not known.

this model is, in part, based on the action of many of these same pancreas-essential transcription factors in neuronal development in which the interactions of cross repressive transcription factors and gro/tle proteins are critical for the proper inhibition of opposing factors  <cit> . evidence suggesting that this model applies to pancreas development is beginning to emerge. for example, nkx2- <dig> knock-out mice develop normal numbers of endocrine precursors which differentiate almost exclusively into ghrelin cells. knock-in of a mutant nkx2- <dig> composed of a dna binding domain and a gro/tle interaction domain, but lacking an activation domain results in the development of primarily α-cells  <cit> . in contrast knocking in a mutant nkx2- <dig> containing the activation domain but not the gro/tle interaction domain produces a phenotype similar to the nkx2- <dig> knock out. these data suggest that repression of pro-ghrelin cell factors via gro/tle proteins is essential for the appropriate differentiation of a hypothetical tripotent  precursor into a bipotent α/β cell precursor; whereas activation of target genes by nkx2- <dig> is required for the proper differentiation of α/β progenitors into β-cells. in addition, nkx6- <dig> and nkx6- <dig> act in a cross repressive fashion during motor neuron development  <cit>  and at least in the case of nkx6- <dig> this repression is gro/tle dependent  <cit> . the expression of nkx6- <dig> in the pancreas can be seen from e <dig>  to e <dig>  whereas nkx6- <dig> becomes predominantly expressed starting at e <dig>   <cit>  and nkx6- <dig> knock-out mice have elevated levels of nkx6- <dig>  <cit> . these data suggest that nkx6- <dig> represses nkx6- <dig> in a gro/tle dependent manner as occurs in motor neuron development  <cit> . recent evidence indicates nkx6- <dig> does not act to repress alternative cell fates directly  <cit>  and instead acts to "prime" progenitor cells to be able to become β-cells. how the repressive versus activational activities of nkx6- <dig> factor into this remains to be elucidated, although it seems likely that nkx6- <dig> inhibits the expression of factors that repress pro-β cell factors such as myt <dig>  whose expression is reduced in nkx6-1-/- mice  <cit> . on the other hand, arx misexpression throughout the developing pancreas induces a clear loss of β and δ cells  <cit> . in fact, arx is directly cross-repressive with pax <dig> during pancreas development  <cit> , further indicating that this factor represses genes essential to alternative cell fates and here we show that arx interacts with tle <dig> and that tle <dig> modulates it's repressive effects.

CONCLUSIONS
at least  <dig> gro/tle interaction domain containing transcription factors are expressed in the endocrine pancreas lineage. these factors are known to control multiple critical steps in pancreatic development including progenitor cell specification as well as endocrine cell type specification and maturation. tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed dynamically during pancreas development. tle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> overlap in expression in the pancreatic epithelium at e <dig>  suggesting they have redundant roles at this time. during the secondary transition their expression alters dramatically with tle <dig> being lost from the epithelium and tle <dig> and tle <dig> expressed in only a subset of ngn <dig> positive cells. this indicates that as ngn <dig> expressing cells mature they lose tle <dig> and tle <dig> expression. however, by e <dig>  these factors are re-activated and co-expressed in α, β, and δ cells, although only tle <dig> was found in pp cells. tle <dig> expressing cells were less abundant and we show tle <dig> is expressed in δ and pp cells but not in α or β cells. tle <dig> was only found in a rare subset of endocrine cells that did not express any of the markers tested. we also show that tle <dig> can interact with factors involved in progenitor cell maintenance , and endocrine cell maturation and specification . moreover, we provide evidence that tle <dig> modulates the ability of arx to repress the β-cell phenotype using a rat insulin reporter in a gro/tle interaction domain dependent fashion. in sum these data suggest that tle <dig> –  <dig> are involved in a wide range of processes and are recruited by numerous transcription factors essential to proper pancreas development and function.
