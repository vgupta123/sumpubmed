BACKGROUND
a microarray is defined as an ordered array of microscopic elements on a planar substrate which allows specific binding of genes or gene products  <cit> . for spotted cdna microarrays double-stranded dna sequences of length  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs are printed on the substrate, which is usually a glass slide. the printed spots have a diameter in the range of some hundred μm and each spot consists of dna specific to one gene. oligonucleotide microarrays have probes with single-stranded oligonucleotides consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide molecules. oligonucleotides may also be used for spotted microarrays.

fluorescent dyes, typically with emission wavelengths in the green and red bands, are attached to the test and reference cdna samples. equal amounts of labeled test and reference cdna are allowed to hybridize to the probes on the microarray. after abundant dna is washed off the slide is scanned with a laser scanner resulting in two high-resolution images, one for each channel.

spot intensity signals obtained from scanning a microarray do not only originate from fluorescent molecules attached to hybridized dna, but also from other sources referred to as background. for instance, the source of the background signal could be fluorescence from the coating of the glass or contamination from the hybridization and washing procedures. the scanner device can also be a major source of background due to varying filter bandwidths, optics or photomultiplier tubes  <cit> . background is assumed to be additive to the true spot signal such that the measured spot intensity equals true intensity plus background intensity.

the standard method for estimating the background of a spot is to assume that the background level is the same as the intensity in the proximity of the spot . two major approaches exist for estimating this intensity. the first, and most common, is to select an area near each spot and after identifying so called background pixels within this area, the background estimate of the spot is then taken as the sample median  of these pixels. one of the tools used for benchmarking in this paper -genepix pro by axon instruments inc. – uses this method  <cit> . the second approach uses estimates that do not depend on the segmentation and the exact positioning of the spots. examples are histogram and filter estimates. histogram-based methods are not covered here. a morphological-opening filter together with additional methods is available in spot by csiro  <cit> . a method similar to morphological opening was suggested in  <cit> , and in  <cit>  it was used as a "gold standard". the theory of mathematical morphology has extensively been treated in  <cit>  and  <cit> , where the latter focuses on morphological filters. a survey of the generalization, rank filters, can be found in  <cit> .

in  <cit>  a number of commercially and freely available microarray image analysis methods were compared with the conclusion that morphological opening gives the best estimates of background levels. this paper further concludes that the choice of method for background estimation has a greater impact on the final log-ratios than the choice of method for spot segmentation.

in order to obtain an estimate of the true spot intensity it is almost universal to subtract the background estimate from the foreground estimate  <cit> . note that even with unbiased background estimates not only half of the unexpressed spots, but also a great number of low-expression spots can be expected to have negative values after background correction. negative spot values cause problems in the down-stream analysis and negative-biased background estimates, such as the morphological-opening estimates  <cit> , which produce fewer negative signals, have been suggested to overcome this problem. it is also common to define a threshold  that foreground intensity must exceed in order for the spot to be considered  <cit> . however, these low-intensity spots may contain valuable information, which is lost in this approach. in  <cit> , bayesian statistics is used to solve the problem with negative background corrected spots. relying on the prior knowledge that the true spot intensity should be non-negative, the posterior distribution of the true spot intensity is calculated. thereby not only negative spots, but also spots with intensities slightly above background, are estimated more accurately.

this paper is organized as follows. the results section starts with a detailed description of the data analyzed, especially its background properties. this section then gives definitions and important properties of rank filters including morphological filters and also details on the background-estimation algorithms that use such filters. at the end, in the results section, the bias and variability of the different methods, a novel rank filter, methods available in genepix pro and spot plus a non-adaptive region-based method, are presented. the paper concludes with a discussion and major conclusions.

RESULTS
data
four microarrays provided by the swegene dna microarray resource center in lund have been investigated. these slides, here named slide  <dig> to  <dig>  have the same identical layout with  <dig> ×  <dig> print-tip groups, each containing  <dig> ×  <dig> spots, making a total of  <dig> spots per slide. the slides are replicates of each other such that the same gene is found at the same row and column. the lower  <dig> ×  <dig> groups are replicates of the upper  <dig> ×  <dig> groups. the same test and reference sample was used for slide  <dig> and slide  <dig>  but with reversed labeling. similarly for slide 3– <dig> but for a different cell line. the test samples represent two different growing conditions for the cell lines, whereas all slides use the same reference samples.

spatial trend
in figure  <dig> the estimated background on slide  <dig> is shown. a spatial trend of the background intensity is clearly visible, and the pattern of this trend is different in the red and green channels. the background intensity of the other slides is similar although with different patterns.

heteroscedastic noise
typically, the standard deviation increases proportionally to the signal level  <cit> . this also applies to microarray images and a consequence of this is that the standard deviation of the background will follow the spatial background trend. this is demonstrated in figure  <dig> where the median absolute deviation of the background pixels is plotted against the background intensity. the median absolute deviation of {xi}i=1n

for normal distributed data the standard deviation is  <dig>  times the median absolute deviation.

pixel distributions
another property of the background pixels is that their distributions are different in the two channels. figure  <dig> shows histograms for selected background regions on slide  <dig> chosen to have approximately the same sample median value. the signals in the red channels are more skewed compared to the signals in the green channels. in the literature, different distributions have been proposed for pixel intensities, e.g. the normal, the lognormal, and the gamma distributions  <cit> .

negative background corrected spots
the estimated background is highly correlated with the weakest spots, see figure  <dig>  there are  <dig> background estimates that exceed the foreground estimates in the red channel on slide  <dig>  ideally, this implies that approximately twice as many or two percents of the genes are unexpressed. this number was less than expected considering the biological layout of the experiment. cross hybridization and other unspecific binding of rna to the spots may add to the signals  <cit> .

rank filters and morphology
definitions and properties
a digital gray-scale image can be represented by the image function f : df → tf, with domains df ⊂ ℤ <dig>  and tf ∈ ℝ or tf ∈ ℤ depending on if the gray levels are continuous or discrete, respectively. that is, f is equal to the gray level at position x = . let b be a compact subset of ℤ <dig> that is symmetric with respect to its origin. a rank filter ζb,k of order k using a structuring element b positioned at pixel x and operating on f, is defined by

)=rankk{f|x−xb∈df;xb∈b},

where the rankk{x} equals the kth element of x sorted in ascending order. it holds that

ζb, <dig> ≤ ζb, <dig> ≤ ... ≤ ζb,n,     

where n = cardinal  equals the number of pixel inside b, that is, the size of the filter mask. moreover, rank filters are increasing meaning that

f ≤ g ⇒ ζb,k ≤ ζb,k.     

the fundamental morphological operations erosion  and dilation  can be written as rank filters;

εb = ζb, <dig>      

δb = ζb,n.     

this follows the definition of dilation in  <cit> . a composition of operators on f is written as ψφ =  = ψ) and ψ <dig> = ψψ . erosion and dilation can be combined to perform morphological openings  and closings  defined by

γb = δbεb,     

ϕb = εbφb.     

that is, an opening is an erosion followed by a dilation, and a closing is a dilation followed by an erosion, both steps using the same structuring element b. moreover, openings are anti-extensive and closings are extensive;

γb ≤ f,     

φb ≤ f.     

furthermore, they are also idempotent;

γb2=γb and ϕb2=ϕb.     
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaaiigacqwfzowzdaqhaawcbagaemoqaieabagaegomaidaaogaeyypa0jae83sdc2aasbaasqaaiabdkeacbqabagccqqggaaicqqghbqycqqgubgbcqqgkbazcqqggaaicqwfvpgadaqhaawcbagaemoqaieabagaegomaidaaogaeyypa0jae8x1do2aasbaasqaaiabdkeacbqabagccqgguaglcawljagaaczcamaabmaabagaegymaejaegymaedacagloagaayzkaaaaaa@47a2@

that is, applying an idempotent filter subsequently results in no further change to the image. generally, an operator that is increasing, anti-extensive or extensive and idempotent is called an opening and a closing, respectively.

by replacing the erosion and dilation in equations  and  with rank operators one get "rank opening"  and "rank closing" ;

γb,k = ζb,n-kζb,k;  <dig> ≤ k <n/ <dig>     

φb,k = ζb,n-kζb,k; n/ <dig> <k ≤ n.     

note that  and  are obtained by using k =  <dig> and k = cardinal, respectively. the increasing property  of morphological opening and closing holds also for rank opening and closing. to make the analogue to the corresponding morphological filters clear, the words "opening" and "closing" are used although rank opening and closing are in general neither extensive , anti-extensive  nor idempotent .

it should also be emphasized that the word filter as in rank filter, is used in the general meaning, as a synonym for operator. this is not consistent with some of the literature in the field of mathematical morphology where the word filter is reserved for an operator that is increasing and idempotent  <cit> . an special case of rank filtering is obtained if rank is defined as a fraction of the number of pixels inside the structuring element. this is called a quantile filter and is denoted ζb,{q} where the rank is defined by

{q}={⌊cardinal⋅q+1⌋,0≤q<1cardinal,q= <dig>

size and distributions dependence

for  <dig> ≤ k ≤ n where n = cardinal. the summation term is recognized as the probability that amongst n values i of these are less than or equal to z. this is the same as the binomial probability distribution function  <cit> . it is worth noting that pixels become correlated in rank-filtered images.

the background pixels in the unfiltered image can be assumed to be, with some approximation, locally i.i.d. equation  then gives that the mean and the variance of the background pixels in the filtered image depend both on the number of background pixels  inside the structuring element and on the distribution of the pixels ). this is also true for a composition of rank filters such as closing or opening. the dependence on the number of background pixels can clearly be seen in figure  <dig>  which illustrates this dependency for morphological opening; when the size of the structuring element increases, the mean level of the background estimate decreases. it is therefore in general not possible to use the size of the structuring element as a way to control the variance of the estimate. approximating what is observed in the green and the red channels, the differences in bias between normal and lognormal pixel distributions using a morphological-filter estimate are shown in figure  <dig> 
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacqwglbqzdaahaawcbeqaaiabcicaoiabd2gatjabgucariabicdawiabc6cauiabisda0maacaaameqabagaegomaidaasgaei4la8iaegomaijaeiykakcaaaaa@37ee@); m =  <dig> , <dig> . as indicated by the dashed vertical line, the background estimates are unbiased only for one specific size of structuring element b. the estimates will be biased with different amounts depending on the distribution of background noise for all other choices of b.

the linearity of the expectation value gives that if e = m + β, then

e = λm + λβ,     

for some constant λ ∈ ℝ the bias  of the estimate thus increases proportional to the standard deviation of the background pixels as long as the "shape" of the distribution does not change. this dependence of the bias to the pixel variance applies to all rank-based estimates, including the sample median. because of this, and as further illustrated in figure  <dig>  it is not sufficient to shift the estimates  in order to correct for bias.

block structure effects
when an image is processed using a morphological filter the resulting image will have a profound block structure. processing the same image with a rank filter using less extreme rank orders this effect is not longer observed, cf. figure  <dig>  the reason for the block structure is the use of extreme values in the rank operators, cf. equations  and . if inside a window  the minimum  value is chosen, then the distance the window has to move in order to reach a smaller  value is likely to be larger than if, say, the median is used. this block structure increases the variability of the background estimates compared to the smoother rank-filtered image.

filter implementations
morphological filters
one filter used for background estimation in spot and described in  <cit>  is morphological opening , that is, an erosion followed by a dilation with equally sized structuring elements. in spot this method is denoted morph.open . the function of the opening filter is intuitive; the erosion step removes the spots as well as too bright pixels . the dilation is necessary to make the filter idempotent, and thereby preserving size of structures larger than the structuring element. the background estimates are obtained by sampling the filtered image at the spot center locations. because of the anti-extensive property of an opening, background estimates from this filter will be substantially lower than the expectation value of the background intensity. this bias increases with the size of the structuring element. furthermore, the bias also increases with background intensity so that regions with low background give less bias than regions with high background. this is illustrated in figure  <dig>  since the background trends are different in the red and green channels there will be a spatial bias in the background estimate between the two channels.

the negative bias of an opening filter is avoided by preprocessing the image with a small dilation ;

γbδb.     

in spot, this background estimation method is denoted morph.close.open  <cit> . with this method it possible to obtain an estimate in level with the expectation value of the background, cf. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  however, the level of the estimate  still depends on the distribution of the background pixels and the size of the opening. in order to get a correct background estimate the size of the opening must be adjusted to the distribution and the spot-separating distances for each individual array. in spot, the size of the structuring element is determined by the spot-separating distances. the default size is two and a half  times the spot-separating distances  measured from center to center. note how this makes the number of background pixels in the structuring element increase with the distance between spots. according to the preceding section this introduces bias that depends on the spatial design on the slide. moreover, starting with version  <dig> , morphological filters are also available in genepix pro  <cit> .

quantile filters
an advantage of the above described quantile filters is that the level of the background estimate is almost independent of the size of the structuring elements. thereby it is possible to control the variance without affecting the level of the estimate. also, a quantile filter has less variability compared to a morphological filter of the same size. however, the quantile filter is still affected by changes in the distribution of background pixels. as in the case with morphological filters, a negative bias can be avoided by preceding the opening with a small rank filter  to get

γb,{q}ζb,k.     

the bias is preferably controlled both by the rank  and size  of the first small filter as well as the quantile  of the opening, whereas the variance of the estimate is controlled by the size  of the opening.

it is possible to improve the estimates by utilizing a preprocessing mean value filter for the purpose of normalizing the distribution, in accordance with the central limit theorem, which states that the sum  of an i.i.d. sample will be asymptotically normal distributed. even a small sample of nine pixels seems to be sufficient enough to give background pixel distributions that are reasonably equal in shape. however, since robustness decreases with each preprocessing filter, the sensitivity toward outliers with such a filter may be too great for the purpose of background estimation in microarray images. the need for free space between spots is another limiting factor of this approach. this strategy is not pursued further in this paper.

size of the structuring element
in the opening step of all the above filters, the size of the structuring element is determined by the number of remaining background pixels after the preprocessing filters. assume that the distances between spots are greater than the size of the first dilation. then the number of background pixels inside the structuring element b is approximately

nbg ≈ cardinal  - nspots2π,     

where nspots is the number of spots inside the structuring element and rspot is the radius of the average spot. the addition of rΔ to the radius is needed because of a boundary effect around each spot, which depends on the rank and size of the small dilation. if the first step is a rank filter ζb,k, then there can be a maximum of cardinal - k spot pixels inside the structuring element, if the filtered pixel is to be regarded as a background pixel in the proceeding erosion. the number of background pixels used in morph.open is given by rΔ =  <dig> and in morph.close.open by rΔ =  <dig> 

if the same structuring element is used for the whole image, there will be a negative bias in the background estimate for spots located at the border to alleys  because the number of background pixels inside the structuring element increases. for these spots the number of background pixels inside the structuring element is greater than at spots away from the alleys, cf. equation . this is illustrated in figure  <dig> showing a γb,{ <dig> }ζ3× <dig> -filtered image where the alleys appear as slightly darker  horizontal and vertical bands. this effect is stronger if the spot-separating distance is small, which confirm the conclusions in previous sections. this underestimation of the background at the alleys can be solved by using a structuring element  with a variable size such that the number of background pixels inside the structuring element is independent of where on the image it is placed. alternatively, the quantile  may be adjusted.

performance
the estimates of the quantile filter γb,{ <dig> }ζb, <dig> are compared to the background estimates of the commercial software genepix pro by axon instruments and spot from csiro. the sizes of the structuring elements  in the quantile filter are the same as the default sizes of the corresponding morphological filters in spot, whereas the parameters q and k have been manually adjusted to give low bias for slide  <dig> to  <dig>  for slides with a different layout, that is if the spot size and spot-separating distance are different, the structuring element b should be resized to contain approximately the same number of background pixels, cf. equation . compared to the related morphological filter morph.close.open, the above quantile filter is more robust to changes in the distributions of the background pixels.

by default the background mask in genepix pro is a disc with a radius of three times the spot radius excluding spot pixels. since the segmented spots differ in size the number of pixels used by the sample median background estimate varies. for slide  <dig> the number of pixels used in the background sample varies from about  <dig> to  <dig>  which gives estimates with unnecessary large variances, cf. figure  <dig> 

to correct for the above, a related background estimate, referred to as fixedr, was implemented. it differs from genepix pro such that the number of background pixels is fixed by utilizing a fixed radius r. the subscript denotes the radius of the outer circle, and all pixels inside this circle, except for spot pixels, are used in the background sample median estimate. with this approach, all spot masks are equal in size, and thereby the number of pixels in the background samples is equal for all spots.

bias for different estimates
without the possibility to measure the background at the exact spot location all methods rely on the assumption that the real background can be approximated by the pixel intensity between the spots. thus, the methods are designed to estimate the pixel intensity in some region close to each spot. the bias of an estimator is defined as the difference between the expectation value of the estimator and the true value. since all methods try to estimate the between-spot intensity, the true value is supposed to be the mean of the expectation values of the "between-spot background" pixels for some region close to each spot. this region is here chosen to be a circle with a radius of  <dig> pixels, which corresponds to the default size of the background mask in genepix pro and fixed <dig>  an unbiased estimator would be the sample mean. however, for microarray images, the sample mean is not robust enough to be a good estimate of e.

with a breakdown percentage of zero, it takes only one single outlier pixel to corrupt the sample mean  <cit> . instead the bias is measured in relation to the more robust trimmed sample mean . this background method is denoted fixed <dig> t.mean.

the mean bias for the different methods is presented in table  <dig> and the bias dependence on the background intensity is plotted in figure  <dig>  the quantile filter γb,{ <dig> }ζb, <dig> gives the lowest bias followed by genepix pro, fixed <dig> and fixed <dig>  the bias of these methods is in the range of  <dig> to - <dig> for the different slides and channels. the value for genepix pro is misleading since the genepix pro estimates have a great variability upward , resulting in a smaller mean bias. the morphological filter morph.close.open gives a bias between - <dig> and - <dig> when the default value kscale =  <dig>  is used. the highest bias is given by morphological opening  where the mean bias is between - <dig> and - <dig>  in this case the spatial bias between regions with low and high background becomes substantial, cf. figure  <dig>  moreover, as a result of different distributions in different channels the mean bias differ in the red and the green channels.

variability
with an inhomogeneous "unknown" background it is not possible to generate a reliable estimate of the variance of the error in the estimated background values, especially in regions with high variability of the true background values. however, the variability of the background estimates is important. instead of trying to estimate the variance, squared nearest neighbor deviation  is used as a proxy for local variability of estimated background values. s.n.n.d. is defined as

s.n.n.d=∑i=1ni∑j=1nj−φ]2+2)/.

measured spot by spot, Φ is the background estimate at spot , where i and j are the spot row and spot column, and ni and nj are the number of spot rows and columns, respectively. measured pixel by pixel, Φ is equal to the value of the pixel located at x =  in the filtered image and ni × nj is the size of the image.

s.n.n.d. is by construction not an estimate of variance although the two are related. the variability of the error in the background estimates as well as the variability of the true background values contribute to the s.n.n.d. measure. however, the variability of the true values is the same regardless of which background-estimation method is used. for this reason, if the size of the background region over which the estimated background value is computed is the same for the methods, then s.n.n.d. can be used as a relative measure of the variability of the error in the estimates allowing us to compare methods.

the results for slide  <dig> to  <dig> are presented in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the lowest s.n.n.d. is obtained with the quantile filter γb,{ <dig> } ζb, <dig>  the s.n.n.d. of the corresponding morphological filter, morph.close.open, is approximately  <dig> times higher. with a radius comparable to the size of the quantile filter, the s.n.n.d. of the fixed <dig> estimate is only slightly higher than for the quantile filter.

the bias of a rank-filter estimate increases proportional to the standard deviation of the background pixels. negative-biased background methods like spot's morph.open will therefore not be able to follow the spatial trend well enough, cf. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  resulting in a too flat background surface. this effect is stronger in the red channel due to a larger increase in standard deviation as the background intensity increases, cf. figure  <dig>  this explains the much lower s.n.n.d. for morph.open in the red channel. the genepix pro estimates have the highest s.n.n.d., approximately  <dig>  times higher than for the related fixed <dig> 

measured pixel by pixel, the difference in s.n.n.d. of a quantile filter γb,{ <dig> }ζb, <dig> and a morphological filter γbδb , is about one to ten in favor of the quantile filter, cf. table  <dig>  this is expected because of the block structure in the morphological-filtered images. the relative difference between the quantile filter and the morpholgical filter due to block structures is reduced to about one to four when measured spot by spot.

discussion
in every step of the overall process from slide manufacturing and the biological setup to the scanning and image analysis, noise is added to the final result. because of this and the fact that all methods try to estimate the same between-spot intensity, a "biological validation" of the different methods discussed in this paper is of little value.

the assumption that the intensity in the area between the spots is equal to the background intensity of the actual spot can be questioned because it is frequently observed that background intensities of spot areas that are covered with printed cdna may differ from the intensities in areas where no dna is printed. if "dark" spots, that is spots significantly lower in intensity than the surrounding regions, occur in the image, then it must be that the mean intensity in the area between those spots is higher than the actual zero level of the spot. on the other hand, if the correlation between the spots with the lowest intensity and the estimated background is as great as in figure  <dig>  this is a strong indication that the intensity in the area between the spots is proportional to the actual background of the spot. an interesting approach would be to use negative controls  as a quality measure or for calibration of the background estimates. another alternative to standard background subtraction is spatial normalization  <cit> . a comparative study between these alternatives is needed.

CONCLUSIONS
the performance of properly adjusted rank-filter estimates is equal to, or even slightly better than local region-based methods. the previously suggested morphological opening has a substantial bias in the estimates and because of the spatial dependence of the bias this can not be corrected for by a subsequent normalization.
