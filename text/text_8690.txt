BACKGROUND
scrapie is a well-known prion-associated sheep encephalopathy that was identified in the xviii century. scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease and related forms affect also humans  and cattle . it is characterized by accumulation in the central nervous system of a pathological agent, the prion protein   <cit> , which differs from the endogenous normal form  in conformational changes, partial resistance to proteolytic degradation and insolubility in the presence of detergents  <cit> . scrapie is a good model to study transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  since the disease is related to genetic factors. the natural occurrence of scrapie is associated with the prnp genotype at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . specifically, infected animals present the homozygous prpvrq/prpvrq genotype, whereas healthy ones the homozygous prparr/prparr genotype. the incidence of the pathology is predicted as 100% for prpvrq/prpvrq animals whilst prparr/prparr animals are considered resistant  <cit> . however, few cases of scrapie in prparr/prparr sheep have been reported with biochemical and transmission characteristics similar to those of classic scrapie, although prpsc was associated with lower proteinase k-resistance  <cit> . in contrast to bse, scrapie is associated with wide prpsc dissemination in many non-neural tissues including the lymphoreticular system, the kidney and the placenta  <cit> . the incubation period of the disease is long and silent  and clinical symptoms appear in sheep aged from twelve to fifteen months . prpsc can be detected in prpvrq/prpvrq sheep two months after infection  <cit> . between three to six months after infection, the pathological agent is detected essentially in lymphoid formations associated to the gastrointestinal tract. from six to nine months the secondary lymphoïd organs are also infected and finally at the tenth month after infection the central nervous system is affected  <cit> .

at the moment, unambiguous diagnosis is only possible post-mortem and it is based on the detection of prpsc after proteolytic digestion. a complementary diagnostic evaluation can be performed by immunohistochemistry, western blot or elisa but none of these methods can detect scrapie during the incubation period without autopsy. since prpsc can accumulate in lymphoid tissues before spreading to the nervous system and this accumulation can be very extensive, some authors have proposed using this tissue for the in vivo and post-mortem diagnosis of scrapie  <cit> . however, the sensitivity of this methodology is not well characterised because the magnitude and duration of lymphoid tissue involvement can vary considerably  <cit> .

the diagnosis of tses during the early phase by a rapid test performed in blood is thus required because of the existence of the variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease in humans and its possible iatrogenic transmission by blood  <cit> . currently, several candidate ante-mortem biomarkers from serum, cerebrospinal fluid or tissue have been identified , but none of them is specific or sensitive enough to be used in a routine diagnostic test. the only useful marker for diagnostic tools still is prpsc  <cit> , but its application in an ante-mortem test of prion disease in animals and humans, as proposed by castilla and collaborators  <cit> , with the "protein misfolding cyclic amplification", is still difficult and no significant results are available yet. a new detection method of disease-associated multimeric forms of the prion protein in plasma of prion-affected hamsters and sheep is called 'multimer detection system'  <cit> . the first results provided have now to be confirmed. recently, the prpsc has been detected in blood from sheep infected with scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy  <cit>  and in milk from ewes incubating natural scrapie  <cit> .

we therefore decided to identify blood proteins that could be involved in scrapie development by analyzing a collection of serum samples from healthy and diseased sheep using proteomic tools. the classical proteomic tool, the bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis  has been developed  <dig> years ago. although this technique permits a high resolution separation of proteins, sensitivity and reproducibility of these experiments are not optimal to analyze hundred of highly variable animal samples. moreover, 2-de allows the separation of thousands of proteins but rare proteins are often not detected and low molecular weight proteins are not resolved. on the other hand, surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry , by combining selective protein binding with sensitive and quantitative mass detection, allows the evaluation of protein profiles in a short time from a large number of samples to identify putative biological markers  <cit> . seldi-tof ms was thus used to characterize the protein profile of sera from sheep at early  and late  stages of scrapie. this analysis allowed us to identify a combination of biomarkers that discriminate between early phase  and late phase  of infection. we then validated these findings by assessing the appearance of differential markers in hamsters infected with the  <dig> k scrapie strain, a model of prion infection with shorter kinetics compared to sheep.

methods
scrapie evaluation and serum sampling
a total of  <dig> serum samples of sheep from a naturally scrapie-affected romanov flock  <cit>  were used in this study. blood samples were collected at the veterinary laboratory of toulouse . sheep were classified according to their genotype and histopathological characteristics as shown in table  <dig>  the sheep in the early phase of infection  are  <dig> to  <dig> months/old, they were asymptomatic. the sheep in the late phase of infection  are  <dig> to  <dig> months/old and developed clinical symptoms. we included 78% of females and 22% of males . the sheep presenting the homozygous prparr/prparr genotype are  <dig> to  <dig> months/old. serum from  <dig> vrq/vrq cheviot tse free sheep  was collected and included in the study as a negative control. this flock is the only source in europe of sheep free of classical scrapie.

infection of syrian hamsters with the  <dig> k scrapie strain
infected animals were housed in controlled facilities fully compliant with the european policy on use of laboratory animals . the european guidelines  for animal care and experimentations were followed throughout the duration of the study. they were identified by electronic chips. ten age-matched syrian hamsters were injected intra-peritoneally with  <dig> microliters   of homogenate of brain infected by the  <dig> k scrapie strain diluted into  <dig> μl of phosphate buffer saline.  <dig> mg of infected brain has been crushed into  <dig>  milliliters  of 20% sucrose. serum samples were taken at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-infection. each hamster was sacrificed at the end of the kinetics when it had lost ≈ 30% of its body weight and was no longer able to remain upright and feed by itself  <cit> .

serum protein fractionation
blood was collected in dry tubes; coagulation was allowed by incubating samples at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. following centrifugation, sera were immediately stored at -80°c.

samples were pre-fractionated by anion exchange chromatography according to their charge characteristics, using the "expression difference mapping kit-serum fractionation" from ciphergen biosystems. briefly,  <dig> μl of serum were added to each well of a 96-well culture microplate and proteins were denatured by addition of  <dig> μl of  <dig> m urea, 2% chaps,  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph <dig>  then, each denatured aliquot was transferred into a filtration microplate containing in each well q hyper d f sorbent beads that had been previously rehydrated with  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph <dig>  and equilibrated with  <dig> m urea,  <dig> % chaps,  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph <dig> . in order to bind sample to sorbent,  <dig> μl of  <dig> m urea,  <dig> % chaps,  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph <dig> buffer were added to each well and mixed for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. to collect th e six fractions we added sequentially  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl with  <dig> % ogp, ph <dig>  onto each well of the filtration microplate, then  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm hepes with  <dig> % ogp, ph <dig> , then  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm sodium acetate with  <dig> % ogp ph <dig> , then  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm sodium acetate with  <dig> % ogp ph <dig> , then  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm sodium citrate with  <dig> % ogp, ph <dig>  and finally  <dig> μl of  <dig> % isopropanol,  <dig> % acetonitrile,  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid . fractions were stored at -80°c.

seldi-tof ms analysis of sera
proteinchip® cm <dig>  were pre-treated with  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m sodium acetate, ph <dig> twice. five μl of each fraction were diluted in  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m sodium acetate ph <dig> for use with weak cation exchanger  8-spot protein chip arrays and incubated on a shaker in a humidified chamber at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. spots were washed with  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m sodium acetate ph <dig> twice for  <dig> minutes, followed by a quick rinse in de-ionized h2o. after air-drying, a sinapinic acid solution  , prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, was added to each spot. arrays were analyzed with a pbs-ii mass reader  using the seldi  <dig> . <dig> software . we performed the data acquisition of low molecular weight proteins by detecting the optimized size range between  <dig> and  <dig> kdaltons  with a maximum size of  <dig> kda. data were collected by averaging  <dig> laser shots with an intensity of  <dig> arbitrary units. the mass-to-charge ratio  of each protein captured on the array surface was determined according to externally calibrated standards : hirudin bhvk , bovine cytochrome c , equine myoglobin  and bovine carbonic anhydrase .

biostatistics analysis
signal analysis
all spectra were compiled and qualified mass peaks  with mass-to-charge ratios  between  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda were auto-detected. peaks clusters were completed using second-pass peak selection  within  <dig> % mass windows and estimated peaks were added. to avoid matrix interference, we removed all signals below  <dig> kda and peaks intensities were normalized to the total ion current of m/z between  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda. analyses were performed using the protein chip software  <dig> . <dig> .

differential analysis of peak intensities
all normalized spectra were exported into an expression matrix n × m where n represents the mass peak and m the serum sample; the relative intensity of each peak is available. peaks were selected by their statistical significance using the "significance analysis of microarray" method   <cit> , a parametric method based on a modified student's t-test currently used in genomic analysis. significant peaks were selected when their score deviated from the average score obtained after  <dig> permutations of matrix. the accuracy of markers and their discriminatory power were evaluated through receiving operating characteristics  curves analysis  <cit> . roc curves are graphical visualizations of the reciprocal relation between sensitivity  and specificity  of a test for various values. the area under the curve  is a good evaluation of the combination of se and sp for a given test.

statistical validation
the best markers were combined to increase their se and sp with the mroc program  <cit>  and with two supervised learning algorithms, adaboost  <cit>  and support vector machine   <cit> . the mroc program calculated the linear combination which maximized the area under the roc curve for all selected variables . the equation for the respective combination was provided and could be used as a new virtual marker. for a marker combination and for a sample selected, the cut-off was the resulting value of the linear equation corresponding and calculated by the mroc program: cut-off = a × marker <dig> + b × marker <dig> + c × marker <dig>  where a, b and c are coefficients. for this approach, data were previously transformed using the box-cox transformation to ensure a normal distribution  <cit> .

the adaboost algorithm, short for adaptive boosting, is a machine learning algorithm formulated by yoav freund and robert schapire  <cit> . it is a meta-algorithm and can be used in conjunction with weak learning algorithms  to improve their performance. in addition, it is less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. svm has been recognized as the most powerful classifier in various applications of pattern classification. for binary classification, it performs classification tasks by constructing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space  that separate two classes of data with the maximum margin.

to estimate the errors prediction of these classifiers, we used the 10-fold cross-validation method. to avoid over-fitting problems and to reduce variance, we repeated this 10-fold cross-validation procedure  <dig> times. for this approach, we used the "ipred package" and the "e1071-package" of the r software  <cit> .

the p values were calculated by one way anova or wilcoxon test with kaleidagraph  <dig>  software.

seldi peak identification
the libraries of  <dig> sorbents were obtained from sigma aldrich  and from bio-rad laboratories , as well as materials for electrophoresis such as plates and reagents.

chromatography purification of the  <dig>  <dig> da  biomarker from crude sample "f6"
after screening the libraries of  <dig> sorbents  on a nunc silentscreen 96-filter plate at two different ph binding conditions , two complementary sorbents were chosen to selectively interact at ph <dig> with either the  <dig>  <dig> da target  or with the target impurities .

screening was monitored by seldi-tof ms on cm <dig> arrays.

first,  <dig> μl of f <dig> sample diluted ten times in binding buffer  were incubated in a supelco spin column with  <dig> ml of arginine sorbent. non-retained or flow-through fraction , containing the  <dig>  <dig> da target, but now free of key impurities, was obtained by centrifugation . then, the ft fraction  was poured in a  <dig> ml falcon tube and  <dig> μl of deae-macropep sorbent was added. incubation was performed by gentle vertical stirring at room temperature for one hour. after incubation, ft fractions were centrifuged , beads transferred in a  <dig> μl microtube, extensively washed with  <dig> μl of binding buffer and the enriched  <dig>  <dig> da biomarker was sequentially eluted with  <dig> μl of the following eluents: a)  <dig>  m urea, 1% chaps; b)  <dig> m urea, 2% chaps; c)  <dig> m urea, 2% chaps,  <dig> % ammonium hydroxide. elution was monitored by seldi-tof ms on cm <dig> arrays, and the most enriched  <dig>  <dig> da fraction  selected for final purification on sds-page after ph neutralization with acetic acid.

preparative final purification of  <dig>  <dig> da marker by sds-page
 <dig> μl of each enriched sample were mixed with  <dig> μl of laemmli buffer  from bio-rad. the mixture was heated in boiling water for  <dig> minutes and immediately loaded on the gel. the sds-page gel was composed of a stacking gel  with a large-pore polyacrylamide gel  cast over the resolving gel . the cathodic and anodic compartments were filled with tris-glycine buffer, ph <dig> , containing  <dig> % sds. the electrophoretic run was done at  <dig> v until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. staining and de-staining were performed using the colloidal coomassie blue staining kit from invitrogen . putative blue bands were excised and split in two. the smallest part  was to confirm the presence of the  <dig>  <dig> da biomarker by seldi-tof ms , after protein extraction with a solution of formic acid -acetonitrile -2-propanol -water  for  <dig> hours at room temperature. the other part  was trypsinized for protein identification by liquid chromatography ms/ms  .

analysis of crude and purified fractions by seldi-tof ms
after protein extraction, fractions at appropriate concentration, i.e.  <dig>  μg/μl, were deposited upon proteinchip® array surfaces, using a bioprocessor device. two types of arrays were selected: cm <dig>  and np <dig> . each array contained eight distinct spots over which the adsorption of protein could be performed. after applying the samples, the chip surfaces were washed to remove non-associated protein  and then dried and prepared for analysis after application of  <dig> μl of energy adsorbing matrix solution composed of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid. all arrays were then analyzed with a pcs  <dig> proteinchip® ms reader. the instrument was used in a positive ion mode, with an ion acceleration potential of  <dig> kvolts and a detector gain voltage of  <dig> kvolts. the mass range investigated was from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda. the laser intensity was set between  <dig> and  <dig> units according to the sample tested. the instrument was mass calibrated with a kit of standard mass mixture "all-in- <dig> protein standard" .

protein identification by lc-ms/ms
putative blue bands manually excised from the gel were sent to the functional proteomic platform in montpellier  and protein identification was done according to a standard operating procedure. tryptic peptides were analyzed by an esi-ion trap mass spectrometer , interfaced with an hplc-chip system . a sample volume of  <dig> μl was loaded onto a c- <dig> enrichment cartridge  with a flow rate of  <dig>  μl/min of  <dig> %  formic acid. after pre-concentration and clean-up, peptides were separated in the column  at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min using a gradient of 3% to 80%  acetonitrile in  <dig> minutes . peptides were eluted into the high capacity ion trap . capillary voltage was  <dig> - <dig> kvolts in the positive ion mode and a dry gas flow rate of  <dig>  l/minute with a temperature of  <dig> °c was used. the first full-scan mass spectrum was measured for a range from  <dig> to  <dig> m/z. the second scan was done to exactly measure the mr of the three major ions with higher resolution and the third scan to measure the collision-induced ms/ms spectrum of the selected ions. theorical peptide values were obtained from uniprot database  <cit> , the corresponding access number of ovine transthyretin is p <dig> 

RESULTS
reproducibility study
first, to evaluate the reproducibility of seldi-tof ms analyses,  <dig> μg of proteins from a human serum control  were spotted onto three cm <dig> proteinchip® arrays at the same time. the mass spectra were analyzed in the 2- <dig> kda range by seldi-tof ms under identical conditions in the same day . a range of  <dig> to  <dig> peaks were found in the three experiments. the peak number variations detected in the 2- <dig> kda range  among samples were  <dig> %  and the coefficient of variation of peak intensities was lower than 25%. the mass accuracy for such molecular weight was comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. this test was performed before the analysis of sheep and hamster samples.

detection by seldi-tof ms of proteins which are differentially expressed in scrapie
to detect biomarkers characteristic of the ep and lp of scrapie in sheep, we carried out a seldi-tof ms analysis of the profiles of proteins included in the 2- <dig> kda range in the anion-exchange fractions  obtained from serum samples of sheep with  scrapie and healthy controls  . the majority of peaks were found to have a mass smaller than  <dig> kda and few peaks were detected in the high mass molecular weight, above  <dig> kda . a total of  <dig> qualified mass peaks were detected by the ciphergen biosystems software  <dig> . <dig> for all spectra and were analyzed in an expression matrix. differential analysis of peak intensities was conducted using the sam method .

these peaks were selected according to their false discovery rate , their fold change , their auc roc and the sam test. the peak s <dig> and s <dig> were significant both in ep and lp; s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were significant in ep; s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were significant in lp. nd: non determined, only for non significant values.

first,  <dig> serum samples from 7- <dig> month/old animals in the ep of scrapie, which had been classified as prpvrq/prpvrq, were compared to  <dig> serum samples from healthy prparr/prparr sheep. the ep of scrapie infection is very important for diagnostic purposes as the clinical symptoms are not apparent yet and the pathological agent prpsc is moving from lymphoid organs to the brain. seven peaks were found to be differentially expressed in ep animals in comparison to controls and four of them  were considered to be the best candidates as biomarkers of ep scrapie . specifically, three of these peaks  were over-expressed and one  was under-expressed in ep sheep compared to controls. their significant sam values were ≥  <dig>  and the fold change was ≥  <dig>  or  <dig>  with a null q-value. moreover, the biomarker accuracy test  of the four peaks showed an auc >  <dig>  with the following individual values:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the distribution of the intensity values for the s <dig> to s <dig> biomarkers in control and ep sheep populations  confirmed that s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were significantly over-expressed and s <dig> under-expressed in ep sheep in comparison to healthy controls.

then,  <dig> serum samples from 13- <dig> month/old prpvrq/prpvrq sheep with lp scrapie were compared to the  <dig> serum samples from healthy, prparr/prparr animals. in lp scrapie, animals develop clinical symptoms  as the central nervous system is affected. among the ten peaks differentially expressed in lp animals, four  were chosen as putative lp biomarkers . three peaks  were over-expressed and one peak  was under-expressed in lp sheep compared to controls. their significant sam values were ≥  <dig>  and the fold change was ≥  <dig>  or  <dig> . moreover, the biomarker accuracy test  of the four peaks showed an auc >  <dig>  with the following individual values:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the distribution of the intensity values of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  confirmed the over-expression of markers s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and the under-expression of marker s <dig> in lp sheep in comparison to healthy controls.

in conclusion,  <dig> peaks were found to significantly differentiate ep from control or lp animals and  <dig> peaks to significantly discriminate lp from control or ep animals. all together  <dig> different peaks were selected and  <dig> peaks  were found to be significant in both phases of the disease.

ep and lp biomarkers panel best combination
the previous data indicate that none of the selected biomarkers is sensitive and specific enough to be used as a single signature biomarker of scrapie in ep or in lp. we thus used the mroc program to test whether the combination of the four best ep  or of the four best lp  biomarkers could improve their diagnostic accuracy . the analysis of the roc curve for the ep combination gave a better auc  compared with the aucs of the individual biomarkers and this combination showed a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %. conversely, the panel of lp biomarkers reached only a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %; however, its auc of  <dig>  was better than the one of the single biomarkers, confirming that the combined set of lp biomarkers was more reliable than the individual biomarkers.

adaboost and svm were also used to evaluate the potential diagnostic characteristics of our set of biomarkers. the se and sp values obtained with adaboost and svm were comparable to those obtained with mroc . specifically, when control sheep were compared to ep sheep all methods generated results closed to the mroc values with an average specificity and sensitivity of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. when control sheep were compared to lp sheep, the obtained se and sp values were more variable with an average specificity of  <dig> % and an average sensitivity of  <dig> %. in this case, adaboost  seemed to perform better than svm . we investigated the possible correlation of s <dig> to s <dig> biomarkers with sex and the corresponding p-values were obtained according to one-way anova with a no significant value of more than  <dig> .

the different classifiers used were: svm ; adaboost  and mroc.

analysis of the appearance of serum biomarkers in vrq/vrq cheviot tse free sheep
to test whether the  <dig> best combined ep biomarkers  and the  <dig> best combined lp biomarkers  presented in table  <dig> could be significant in another sheep, we analyzed serum samples from  <dig> vrq/vrq cheviot tse free sheep . sera were fractionated and analyzed in the 2- <dig> kda range using cm <dig> proteinchips®. the seldi-tof ms protein profiles of fractionated serum from negative controls  and infected ep sheep  were significantly different, focusing independently on each biomarker of interest . minor or no differences were observed comparing the lp biomarkers on seldi-tof ms protein profiles of fractionated serum samples from negative control sheep  with those from lp sheep . these results show that the best combination of ep biomarkers could be significant comparing serum samples collected from animals from different laboratories. furthermore, these results suggest that the ep signature pattern is correlated to the disease and not to the genotype. still, an increased number of serum samples from tse free sheep is necessary to further confirm theses observations.

analysis of the appearance of serum biomarkers in hamsters infected with the  <dig> k scrapie strain
to test whether the  <dig> biomarkers  presented in table  <dig>  including biomarkers specific for ep and lp phase of scrapie could be detected in another species using the same technology, we infected ten syrian hamsters, in which the course of the disease is much more rapid than in sheep, with the  <dig> k scrapie strain and collected serum at different time points  during disease progression. as with the sheep samples, hamster sera  were fractionated and each anion-exchange fraction  was analyzed in the 2- <dig> kda range using cm <dig> proteinchips® under identical conditions and in the same day. the seldi-tof ms protein profiles of serum from syrian hamsters were different from those of sheep . nevertheless, the mass of three of the fifteen sheep candidate biomarkers could be detected in the hamster protein profile: s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig> . their intensity was followed throughout the course of the disease and two different behaviors could be observed. the intensity of peak h <dig> increased early after infection and continued to grow in a regular way . conversely, the intensity of peak h <dig> and h <dig> remained stable and dramatically increased only at the very end of the lp of disease  . these results suggest that also in the hamster model of scrapie it is possible to distinguish between proteins which are differentially expressed in the ep of the disease  in comparison to healthy controls and proteins which are characteristic of the lp of infection .

identification and validation of s <dig> biomarker in sheep
we focused our interest on the h <dig> peak which could be considered as an early biomarker of disease in the hamster model. h <dig> had a mass of  <dig>  <dig> da which corresponded to that of peak s <dig> in sheep. however, while in the hamster model h <dig> was over-expressed, in sheep s <dig> was down-regulated and it was classified as a marker of lp scrapie . with the aim of understanding the reason of this discrepancy, we decided to identify in sheep serum the protein composition of this peak. we first performed purification and enrichment  of the  <dig>  <dig> da biomarker obtained from selected resins . the  <dig>  <dig> da biomarker was successfully enriched and amplified after scaling up by  <dig> folds the sample load on selective resins. step gradient elution using optimal conditions also improved markers purity. the final step of the purification consisted in sds-page separation and seldi-tof ms analysis of the selected  <dig>  <dig> da band which was visible after colloidal blue staining thanks to the  <dig> fold scale-up amplification . finally, using lc-ms/ms analysis, the s <dig> peak was identified as a major fragment  of the transthyretin monomer . the corresponding peptides are described in figure  <dig> and the sequence coverage of the protein is  <dig> %. the transthyretin protein in hamster  presents 94% of similarities with the sheep one and 91% considering the fragment of interest corresponding to s <dig> biomarker. furthermore, we investigated the reproducibility of s <dig> under-expression and h <dig> over-expression by western blot analysis  and  <dig> healthy sheep ; additional file 2: transthyretin western blot analysis in serum  from  <dig> syrian hamsters at different kinetic points of the scrapie  <dig> k infection). the results showed an under-expression of the transthyretin monomer, dimer and tetramer  in serum from healthy sheep comparing to the same isoforms in serum from lp sheep. in hamsters infected by scrapie, we found the expression of the monomer isoform increasing with the time of infection. we also determined the transthyretin protein level in serum from healthy sheep , ep sheep  and lp sheep  . total transthyretin protein concentration is significantly decreased in lp sheep  whereas it is not in ep sheep . all these observations correlate to the seldi-tof ms analysis. the curve representations of total ovine transthyretin concentrations fluctuation in healthy and pathological sheep indicate that transthyretin under-expression is not correlated with the age.

discussion
in this study, we report the first analysis of potential biomarkers in serum of sheep during the first  <dig> to  <dig> months of scrapie infection. our results indicate that we have detected a biomarker profile which could be used to diagnose scrapie in sheep with no apparent symptoms during the incubation phase of the disease. this is important as access to serologic markers can avoid invasive acts as biopsy or lumbar punction; however, complementary research is needed to confirm the real relevance of these proteins as tses biomarkers. particularly, age matching is not fully balanced since it was difficult to find a large cohort of young control sheep. a validation study with age-matched animals will permit to confirm the robustness of the results. the main bottle-neck of seldi-tof ms profiling technology is the purification and the identification of individual proteins, therefore we need to concentrate our resources on biomarkers that are most likely to be biologically significant, such as the 4-protein signature we detected in ep sera. conversely, the specificity and sensitivity of the combination of lp markers is not sufficient enough to exploit them further.

the kinetic study of the proteomic content of sera from hamsters infected with the  <dig> k scrapie strain allowed the detection of three differentially expressed peaks . h <dig> increased early and regularly during the course of the disease, whereas h <dig> and h <dig> increased suddenly at very end of the infection process. none of these biomarkers was found to increase in control, not infected hamsters. interestingly, s <dig> and h <dig> have the same molecular mass, but their intensities vary differently in sheep and in hamsters along time. s <dig> was then identified as a fragment of the transthyretin monomer. transthyretin or pre-albumin is a homo-tetramer glycoprotein synthesized by liver and present in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid. it has a molecular mass of  <dig> kda and is the main thyroxin and vitamin a transporter. transthyretin is an early marker of under-nutrition; its plasma level is decreased in case of liver failure, inflammatory syndrome and increased in case of chronic renal insufficiency. transthyretin was already quoted in literature as a molecule associated with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis  <cit> , amyloid polyneuropathy  <cit>  and tses  <cit> . it has been previously described as a creutzfeldt-jakob disease biomarker detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid  <cit> . furthermore, several proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyloid beta, tau, prions and transthyretin, were found to be glycated in patients, and this is thought to be associated with increased protein stability through the formation of crosslinks that stabilize protein aggregates  <cit> . a proteic characterization of the transthyretin fragment found discriminant in our study can provide useful informations for tses diagnostic. the molecular mass of the transthyretin monomer is  <dig>  kda; therefore by seldi-tof ms we detected a major fragment of the monomer. in scrapie sheep, its intensity decreased with the disease, whereas it increased in infected hamsters. furthermore, sample handling can play a role in proteomics variations  <cit> . finally, since in hamsters scrapie is not a naturally occurring disease, different pathological mechanisms, and hence different protein signatures, could play a role in the development of the disease. unfortunately, due to volume limitations, we could not identify the  <dig>  <dig> da seldi peak in hamster serum for cross-validation. the transthyretin analysis done by western blot and serum level quantification confirmed the seldi-tof ms results. in a recent study, a training set of biomarkers has been established in brain homogenate samples from a murine model infected by the me- <dig> scrapie strain  <cit> . two of the biomarkers found discriminant in the infected animals compared to controls may correspond in m/z to the biomarkers s <dig>  h <dig>  and s <dig> . their fluctuation is inversely correlated with s <dig> and s <dig>  confirming that depending on the model and the time course study, biomarkers can be significantly down or up regulated and that protein expression in tse disease exist across different species. the biomarkers we identified can be used as a target of development of future immunobased assay more suitable for veterinary or clinical analysis and compatible with blood screening.

CONCLUSIONS
currently, the quest of non invasive tses biomarkers remains important and the development of a rapid, sensitive, specific, ante-mortem test is still needed. indeed, a recent report detailed that prions adhere to soil minerals and remain infectious  <cit>  such that unidentified environmental reservoirs of infectivity contribute to the natural transmission of prion diseases in sheep, deer and elk. although the pandemic infection is now minimized, we need to remain vigilant to prevent a new crisis. the development of non-prion protein biomarkers for tses has been reported recently due to the advances in post-genomic technologies. however, more work needs to be done to confirm the specificity and sensitivity of bioassays combining the identified biomarkers. the remaining steps will be to design specific probes against biomarkers and optimize bioassay condition. then, large scale validation would be affordable. these steps are mandatory to envision a future peripheric tse bioassay.
