BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut or groundnut  is an allotetraploid  legume crop and is widely grown worldwide in > <dig> countries with global annual production of  <dig>  million tonnes . peanut is an important oil crop and has a key role in human nutrition  <cit> . improving yield has been one of the major objectives in peanut breeding programs, which is directly influenced by pod-related traits  . quantitative traits, including prts, show complex interaction with environment leading to varied productivity under different environments. in order to select a promising line for varietal release, breeders need to assess its potential in multiple environments to check its stable performance to achieve higher adoption in the farmers’ field. in a breeding program, it is very difficult and expensive to screen large number of lines across multiple environments for yield assessment. genomics-assisted breeding  has potential to accelerate the process of achieving higher genetic gain in less time and with minimum resources using molecular markers  <cit> . in order to deploy gab, linked markers for prts is essential for developing high yielding peanut varieties.

quantitative trait locus  mapping using bi-parental population has been widely conducted successfully to identify the genomic regions associated with quantitative traits in several crop plants  <cit>  including peanut. in recent years, qtls associated with economically important traits such as disease resistance  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , seed and oil quality  <cit> , agronomic and yield traits  <cit>  were identified in peanut crop. molecular markers tightly linked to qtls after validation can be further deployed in gab  <cit> . for example, one major qtl for rust resistance was introgressed from resistant cultivar ‘gpbd 4’ into three early maturing elite varieties through marker-assisted backcrossing   <cit> .

limited efforts were made in identifying qtls controlling prts in peanut which did not provided significant results deployable in breeding program. for example, selvaraj et al.  <cit>  identified two ssr markers, pm <dig> and seq8d <dig>  linked with pod length using bulked segregant analysis. similarly, shirasawa et al.  <cit>  identified three qtls for pod length and two for pod width in an f <dig> population while fonceka et al.  <cit>  mapped three qtls for pod length, six for pod width and two for hundred-pod weight in an advanced backcross population. more recently, huang et al.  <cit>  detected one qtl for pod length, two qtls for pod width and three qtls for hundred-pod weight in an f2: <dig> population. in addition to above, chen et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> qtls for pod length and width in two f2: <dig> populations. however, quantitative traits are highly influenced by environments and qtls identified at one specific location may not be valid for another location with varied environmental conditions  <cit> . majority of the studies identified qtls in segregating populations and not in fixed population such as ril population.

the ril population can be repeatedly used for generation of phenotyping data in multiple environments which is a key factor in doing genetic dissection of complex and quantitative traits, thereby helping in precise identification of consistent and stable qtls. the variety yuanza  <dig> is small-podded with low pod weight while the variety xuzhou 68- <dig> has large pods and higher pod weight. in this study, a ril population was developed from the cross between yuanza  <dig> and xuzhou 68- <dig> and used to identify qtls controlling yield-related traits such as pod length , pod width , and hundred-pod weight  across four environments.

methods
plant materials
a recombinant inbred line  population in f <dig> generation was developed from a cross between yuanza  <dig> and xuzhou 68- <dig> using single seed decent method to construct a dense genetic linkage map and conducting qtl analysis for pod features. the female parent, yuanza  <dig>  belongs to a. hypogaea subsp. hypogaea var. vulgaris and is derived from interspecific hybridization between the cultivated peanut baisha <dig> and wild species a. chacoense. the male parent, xuzhou 68- <dig>  belongs to a. hypogaea subsp. hypogaea var. hypogaea and has significantly larger pods than the female parent, yuanza  <dig>  a total of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  were used in the present study for generating genotyping and phenotyping data followed by genetic map construction and qtl analysis.

field trials for generating phenotyping data
phenotyping data was generated on the ril population for four environments i.e., three environments at wuhan , china  while single environment at xiangyang , china . these experiments were designated as wh <dig>  wh <dig>  wh <dig> and xy <dig>  respectively. each environment was a field trial conducted at a location in a year in this paper. the random block design  with three replications was adopted for generating phenotyping data during all the four environments. each ril was planted in a  <dig>  m long single-row and row-to-row space was 33 cm. there were  <dig> plants in each row with plant-to-plant distance of 20 cm. of these  <dig> plants,  <dig> plants in the middle of each row were harvested for trait measurement. three important pod related traits , pod length , pod width  and hundred-pod weight , were measured three times for each replication according to previously described standard procedures  <cit> . to reduce the influence of environmental factors, the mean trait value in each trial was used in analysis.

statistical analysis of phenotyping data
statistical analysis for the phenotypic data of prts was conducted using ibm spss statistics version  <dig> software  <cit> . the shapiro-wilk  statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that the phenotypic data were normally distributed. the univariate variance analyses were performed using standard glm method and variance components were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood  method. the broad-sense heritability for each trait across the four environment trials was calculated based on the estimated variance components with the following formula: h2=σg2/σg2+σg×e2+σe <dig> based on plot mean and h2=σg2/σg2+σg×e2/r+σe2/rn based on entry mean, where σg <dig> is the genotypic variance component among rils, σg×e <dig> is the rils × environment interaction variance component, σe <dig> is the residual  variance component, and r is the number of environment trials, n is the number of replications in each field experiment  <cit> . correlation coefficients between each pair of the three traits were also calculated using ibm spss statistics version  <dig> software  <cit> .

genotyping of mapping population
a total of  <dig>  ssr markers from either published reports  or newly developed ssr markers  from the genome sequences of diploid ancestors  <cit>  were used to screen the polymorphism between parental genotypes of the ril population. polymorphic markers were used to genotype complete ril population along with parental genotypes. genomic dna was extracted from young leaves collected from rils in f <dig> generation using a modified ctab method  <cit> . the integrity and quality of the dna was evaluated on a 1% agarose gel by comparison with uncut lambda dna. pcr amplification was conducted in a 10 μl volume, containing 20 ng dna template,  <dig>  μm each primer, 1× pcr buffer, 1 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntp and  <dig>  u taq polymerase. pcr was performed with a bio-rad t <dig> thermal cycler using the standard pcr program with little modification i.e., 95 °c for 4 min; 35 cycles of 94 °c for 55 s, 55–58 °c  for 45 s, and 72 °c for 1 min; and a final extension step of 72 °c for 10 min. the pcr products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining  <cit> .

construction of genetic linkage map
pearson’s chi square test was used to assess the goodness of fit to the expected segregation ratio 15:2: <dig> for co-dominant marker or 17: <dig> for dominant marker . a genetic linkage map was constructed using the joinmap  <dig>   <cit>  with a maximum recombinant frequency of  <dig> . the recombination ratio was converted to genetic distance by the kosambi mapping function  <cit> . the linkage groups  were designated as chromosome a01-a <dig> and b01-b <dig> based on the common markers as a previously published integrated consensus map  <cit> . this consensus map was constructed based on  <dig> genetic linkage maps  <cit>  and used as reference in other publications  <cit> . the graphical presentation of genetic linkage map was generated with the mapchart  <dig>  software  <cit> .

qtl analysis
genome-wide qtl mapping was performed using the mean value of each trait in each environment. qtl analysis was conducted using the composite interval mapping  method  <cit>  in the windows qtl cartographer  <dig>  software  <cit> . the standard cim model  and forward regression method were selected. the number of control markers, window size and walk speed were  <dig>   <dig> and 2 cm, respectively. the threshold of lod for declaring the presence of a qtl was determined by  <dig> permutation tests. when separated by a minimum distance of 20 cm, two peaks on one chromosome were considered as two different qtls  <cit> . otherwise, the higher peak was chosen to more closely approximate the position of the qtl. if qtls for the same trait detected in different environments had overlapping 2-lod support intervals, they were considered to be the same qtl and also been designated as consistent qtls. similarly, if the same qtl appeared in both the locations , such qtls were refereed as stable qtls. qtls were designated with an initial letter ‘q’ followed by the trait name and the lg corresponding chromosome, similar to the previously described nomenclature  <cit> . after the linkage group, a number was added if more than one qtl was detected for the same trait and linkage group. for example, if two qtls for pod length were detected on chromosome a <dig>  they were named as qpla <dig>  and qpla <dig> , respectively. if qtls for different traits had overlapping 2-lod support intervals, they were clustered in specific co-localized chromosomal regions. genome sequences and annotations of the diploid ancestors of cultivated peanut were downloaded from peanutbase  <cit> . molecular markers were positioned on the chromosomal pseudomolecules using blast and epcr  with high similarity parameters  given preference over epcr where both were available)  <cit> .

RESULTS
phenotypic variation of pod related traits 
significant differences were found between the two parents for various prts across four environments i.e., wh <dig>  wh <dig>  wh <dig> and xy <dig> . large phenotypic variations for the prts were observed among rils in all the four environments, showing continuous distributions with transgressive segregation . the normality test indicated that the phenotypic data were normally distributed for prts, except pod weight  in wh <dig> trial, pod length  in wh <dig> trial and hundred-pod weight  in xy <dig> trial . variance analysis for the prts across the four trials showed significant differences among rils, environments and rils × environment interactions . the values of broad sense heritability were estimated to be  <dig>  for pod length,  <dig>  for pod weight and  <dig>  for hundred-pod weight based on plot mean while these estimates were much higher based on entry mean, such as  <dig>  for pod length,  <dig>  for pod weight and  <dig>  for hundred-pod weight. correlation analysis indicated that the three prts had significant positive association between each other  and therefore positive relationship with potential yield.table  <dig> descriptive statistical analysis of phenotypes of pod-related traits in the ril population

molecular marker polymorphisms and genetic map construction
out of  <dig>  ssr markers screened on the parental genotypes of the ril population,  <dig> markers showed polymorphisms in the parents as well as in the ril population . among them, one marker ahgs <dig> amplified three genetic loci and  <dig> markers amplified two loci, while the remaining  <dig> markers amplified a single locus. among these  <dig> genetic loci,  <dig> loci were co-dominant and  <dig> loci were dominant. the chi square analysis identified  <dig> loci  with segregation distortion. a genetic linkage map containing  <dig> loci was constructed spanning  <dig> .57 cm with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm . all the  <dig> loci were assigned to  <dig> lgs whose length varied from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm and number of mapped loci ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> marker loci . based on  <dig> common markers which were also included in a previously published integrated consensus map  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> lgs were assigned to  <dig> chromosomes of the a and b subgenomes . chromosome a <dig> was found to be divided into two lgs  due to insufficient linkage between them. similarly, chromosome a <dig> was divided into lg <dig> and lg <dig> table  <dig> description of the genetic linkage map constructed in this study

detection of qtls for pod related traits 
qtl analysis using phenotyping and genotyping data identified a total of  <dig> qtls with  <dig>  to  <dig> % phenotypic variation explained  associated with the prts in the four environments . for pod length, six qtls were detected in wh <dig> trial , seven qtls in wh <dig> trial , seven qtls in wh <dig> trial , and seven qtls in xy <dig> trial . for pod width, two qtls were detected in wh <dig> trial , seven qtls in wh <dig> trial , five qtls in wh <dig> trial , and three qtls in xy <dig> trial . for hundred-pod weight, six qtls were detected in wh <dig> trial , seven qtls in wh <dig> trial , five qtls in wh <dig> trial , and three qtls in xy <dig> trial .fig.  <dig> qtls distribution of pod-related traits in the genetic map. loci with “#” were common markers which also included in a previously published integrated consensus linkage map  <cit> . wh wuhan, xy xiangyang, pl pod length, pw pod width, hpw hundred-pod weight. pl2013wh means qtl for pod length detected in wuhan  <dig>  etc. the co-localized regions of qtls for different traits were highlighted in blue or red color on the chromosome bars




as shown in fig.  <dig>  some qtls detected in different environments for the same trait had overlapping 2-lod support intervals, and they were considered to be one qtl which could be repeatedly detected. therefore, the  <dig> loci detected in four environment trials were designated as  <dig> qtls for pod length,  <dig> qtls for pod width, and  <dig> qtls for hundred-pod number .

for pod length, the  <dig> qtls were identified on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  two qtls, qpla <dig>  and qpla <dig> , were found to be consistent and stable as they were detected in all four environments. flanked by the marker a05a <dig> and a05a <dig> on chromosome a <dig>  the qtl for pod length, qpla <dig> , explained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in wh <dig>  wh <dig>  wh <dig> and xy <dig> environments, respectively. similarly, another qtl for pod length, qpla <dig> , flanked by aggs <dig> and aggs <dig> on chromosome a <dig> explained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in four environments, respectively. further, two additional qtls for pod length, qpla <dig>   and qpla <dig>  , were mapped on chromosome a <dig> in three environments  with  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % pve, respectively.

for pod width, of the  <dig> qtls identified on five chromosomes , two qtls, qpwa <dig>  and qpwb <dig>  were consistent and stable in expression as they were detected in three environments . the first qtl qpwa <dig>   had showed  <dig> – <dig> % pve while the second qtl qpwb <dig>  showed  <dig> – <dig> % pve in wh <dig>  wh <dig> and xy <dig> trials.

similarly for hundred-pod weight, the  <dig> qtls were identified on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  a major qtl on chromosome a <dig>  designated as qhpwa <dig> , was detected in all four environments and hence consistent and stable. interestingly, it was flanked by the same markers  as the major qtl qpla <dig>  for pod length and had shown  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % pve in wh <dig>  wh <dig>  wh <dig> and xy <dig>  respectively.

a co-localized region of stable and major qtls for prts on chromosome a05
a total of  <dig> chromosomal regions harbored qtls for different traits where multiple qtls were mapped . this phenomenon was not unexpected given the strong positive correlations among the three traits , indicating the existing of pleiotropic effects of single gene or tight linkage. a co-localized qtl interval close to the end region of chromosome a <dig> was significantly more dominant than others. it was located at  <dig> – <dig>  cm map position on chromosome a <dig> and covering around  <dig>  cm in length with flanking markers a05a <dig> and a05a <dig> . this region harbored the major qtls for pod length , pod width , and hundred-pod weight  . each qtl was detected at least in three environments and hence more consistent and stable in expression.fig.  <dig> genetic and physical maps of the dominant and co-localized interval on chromosome a <dig>  the legend for qtls was the same as that in fig.  <dig>  gene density indicated gene numbers per 50 kb interval

discussion
the broad-sense heritability estimated in this study was relatively high for pod length, pod width and hundred-pod weight, indicating that genetic factors play a major role in determination of these traits, although influenced by environment. in this study, a ril population was used to construct a dense genetic linkage map and conducting qtl analysis for pod features. a genetic linkage map is a prerequisite to efficiently identify molecular markers associated with quantitative traits. because of a lack of polymorphism at the dna level, the first ssr-based genetic linkage map for peanut only had  <dig> ssr loci. in this study, a genetic linkage map containing  <dig> loci was constructed using joinmap  <dig>   <cit> . it is an user-friendly and widely used commercial software in the scientific community  <cit> , although it was outperformed by some recent tools  <cit>  at speed or manipulation of noisy data. the constructed linkage map covered a total length of  <dig> .57 cm an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm. the loci number and density of our map were relatively higher than that of recent studies  <cit> , except for the integrated consensus map  <cit> . using this linkage map, fifteen qtls were identified for pod length,  <dig> qtls for pod width and  <dig> qtls for hundred-pod weight  in the ril population across four environments. the lod values of these qtls ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were higher than the threshold of lod for declaring the presence of a qtl which was determined by  <dig> permutation tests. all the linked markers identified for pod related traits after validation can be deployed in breeding for marker-based selection to improve yield in peanut.

qtls for pod related traits with stable performance
besides identification of qtls, it is very important to assess their stable performance across varied environments. a similar study conducted by chen et al.  <cit>  detected six qtls for pod length and eight qtls for pod width in a f2: <dig> populations in two environments, but none of them were detected in both environments. despite the significant g × e interactions  present in the four trials conducted in this study, three major qtls  have shown stable performance across four environments and two locations. in addition, four qtls for pod length, four qtls for pod width and two qtls for hpw were detected in two or three trials. such qtls with stable performance for pod related traits have been identified for the first time in peanut and will be very useful for further fine mapping of the qtl region and development of diagnostic markers to use in breeding.

the present study reports  <dig> qtls for pod length mapped on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  the three qtls  were not detected in earlier studies, hence, novel qtls. the chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig> might harbor important genes for pod length as seven qtls from this study and six qtls from earlier studies  <cit>  were mapped on a <dig>  and five qtls from this study and six qtls from previous studies  <cit>  were identified on a <dig>  of these qtls, two qtls, qpla <dig>  and qpla <dig> , identified in this study had stable expression across environments.

similarly, of the  <dig> qtls identified for pod width in this study on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  qtls identified on chromosomes a <dig>  and b <dig>  were novel qtls. chromosome a <dig> seems very important and might harbor important genes for pod width, as five qtls from present study and six qtls from previous studies  <cit>  were mapped on this chromosome. the qtl qpwa <dig>  explained the largest phenotypic variations and consistently expressed across environments. the two qtls reported by previous study conducted by chen et al.  <cit>  and one qtl, qpwa <dig>  identified in this study were mapped on the chromosome a <dig>  similarly, two qtls identified by fonceka et al.  <cit>  and one qtl, qpwb <dig>  detected in this study were mapped on the chromosome b <dig> 

the  <dig> qtls detected in the present study for hundred-pod weight were mapped on the chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  while the five qtls reported in previous studies  <cit>  were located on chromosomes a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  therefore, the  <dig> qtls identified in the present study were novel in nature. of these qtls, the qtl qhpwa <dig>  was the most consistent and stable one. the above results suggested that these pod-related traits are quantitative in nature controlled by multiple genomic regions and their effects were often affected by the environment.

co-localized region on chromosome a <dig> play a major role in controlling pod related traits
the present study identified a co-localized genomic region on a <dig> harboring qtls for pod related traits. this region harbored one important qtl for each pod related traits i.e., qpla <dig>  for pod length, qpwa <dig>  for pod width, and qhpwa <dig>  for hundred-pod weight. this region also provided a significant level of contribution to phenotypic variation explained by these qtls i.e.,  <dig> – <dig> % pve for pod length and  <dig> – <dig> % pve for hundred-pod weight across all the four environments, and  <dig> – <dig> % pve for pod width in three of the four environments. the above results indicate importance of this co-localized region for improving pod related traits through gab. further, this important genomic region also provides opportunity for fine mapping and development of diagnostic markers for use in improving these traits.

in addition to above mentioned further possible studies, the recently completed genome sequences of the diploid ancestors of cultivated peanut  <cit>  provides a physical map of the highest resolution and allows the possibility to examine the co-localized region at the end of chromosome a <dig>  the  <dig>  cm genetic map distance was corresponding to the  <dig>  mb physical map region which houses  <dig> candidate genes. thirteen percent of these genes are novel genes with unknown function and seems to be an enrichment of genes involved in catalytic activity and metabolic process. eight genes were transcription factors and protein aradu.h6fxw seems to have a function in the regulation of cell proliferation. the application of the genome sequences of wild peanut provided us an overview of candidate genes in the chromosome region of interest; however, these genes remain candidates until shown to be causally associated with the phenotypic variations in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified  <dig> qtls for pod length,  <dig> qtls for pod width and  <dig> qtls for hundred-pod weight using a ril population across four environments in two locations. multiple stable and major qtls for pod related traits were co-located at the end of chromosome a <dig>  these qtls needs further investigation to fine map and develop diagnostic markers for these traits to use them in routine breeding program using gab in peanut.
