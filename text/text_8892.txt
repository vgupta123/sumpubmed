BACKGROUND
modern crop breeding techniques such as wide crossing and marker-assisted selection have been highly successful in improving the quality traits of rice  <cit> . however, as slow selection processes and narrow germplasms  <cit>  have raised doubts on how much further current strategies can take us  <cit> , we must diversify the used genetic material and develop novel breeding technologies.

while the germplasm that is actively used for rice breeding may be narrow, the total number of rice varieties is enormous due to its very long domestication history  <cit> . the broader use of available genetic variance has great potential, both to improve crops directly  <cit>  and to elucidate molecular determinants behind quality traits . unfortunately, the necessary molecular characterization is often prohibitively expensive for large seed collections.

genetic core collections of relatively small size have been developed in several rice genebanks to obtain manageable but still representative selections, e.g., the rice germplasm core set  from the international rice research institute   <cit> , the gcore collections   <cit> , the embrapa rice core collection   <cit>  and the rice diversity research set   <cit> . of these, the rdrs is particularly interesting because its restriction fragment length polymorphism  marker diversity is highly representative of cultivated rice ; yet with only  <dig> varieties, it is small enough to allow comprehensive molecular profiling.

direct relationships between metabolic composition and genotype and phenotype have been shown for the model plant arabidopsis thaliana using both recombinant inbred lines  <cit>  and natural varieties  <cit> . metabolomics has emerged a key technology for characterizing crop germplasms; it has the potential to provide a breakdown of complex high-level traits by expressing them as a sum of correlated quantitative molecular features. such molecular factorization may increase the physiological understanding of quality traits and provide clues for possible implications associated with selecting for them. this is highly relevant since metabolic composition is itself an important quality trait as it is tightly connected to the taste and the nutritional and physical characteristics of the harvested material  <cit> .

with these considerations in mind, we aimed to  chart the metabolic diversity of kernels from the rdrs and  investigate the covariance between metabolite profiles and quantitative quality traits. a previous study of  <dig> of the rdrs varieties using 1h-nmr did not reveal any relationship between metabolomic and overall genetic diversity  <cit> . as this finding may be attributable to the small sample size and insufficient resolution of the applied technique, we aimed to obtain metabolomic coverage as high as possible and decided to profile the complete rdrs. because no current single technology can separate all compounds equally well  <cit> , we chose to integrate data from  <dig> complementary mass spectrometry  -based platforms, and thereby reducing bias towards any particular chemical subclass of metabolites  <cit> . the resulting data showed clear compositional differences among the  <dig> genetic subtypes indica i, indica ii and japonica. using a novel extension of orthogonal projection to latent structures   <cit>  that facilitates the handling of multi-block data , we found that given the metabolic composition,  <dig> of the  <dig> studied traits, including the important kernel size  <cit> , ear emergence day  <cit> , and amylose ratio , could be predicted indicating robust trait-metabolite covariance.

starch composition is a major determinant of the taste and texture of cooked rice  <cit> . the packing characteristics of starch also determine the proportion of desired translucent kernels to kernels with chalky white cores that are prone to breakage during processing  <cit> . our metabolomics model confirmed previously observed strong negative associations between fatty acids/lipids and amylose ratios  <cit> . furthermore, the same model accurately predicted the amylose ratio for an independent set of varieties grown in a remote field. however, starch synthase iiia knock-out lines  with white-core phenotypes had very high amylose ratios without the accompanying expected fatty acid/lipid composition, suggesting an important role of fatty acids in starch packing. taken together, our results demonstrate the usefulness of metabolomic profiling of genetically diverse varieties for linking quality traits with molecular features.

RESULTS
multi-platform metabolomics of the rdrs
rice plants from the  <dig> rdrs varieties plus nipponbare , kasalath , and the pokkari variety were grown in a field in tsukuba in  <dig> and harvested after maturation  <cit> . brown rice kernels were ground and analyzed in parallel using  <dig> ms-coupled platforms, i.e. gas chromatography- time-of-flight -ms  for smaller compounds, liquid chromatography-quadrupole-tof-ms  for large hydrophilic compounds, ion trap-tof-ms  for polar lipids  <cit>  and capillary electrophoresis-tof-ms  for ionic compounds . the resulting data were pre-processed, normalized  <cit>  and summarized  <cit>  . metabolite abundances were determined for  <dig> distinct metabolites and  <dig> unknown analytes . principal component analysis  of predicted metabolite physicochemical properties indicated that the detected metabolites covered 87% of the chemical diversity of the metabolites listed in ricecyc . reference data for  <dig> quality traits  were collected from previous analyses and the national institute of agrobiological sciences  genebank  <cit> .

examining the genetic population structure of the rdrs using principal coordinates analysis on the matching coefficient-based genetic distance matrix  and the structure program   <cit> , we confirmed the presence of  <dig> major subtypes are indica i, indica ii and japonica type rice . pca showed that these subtypes also are distinguishable among the investigated quality traits as well as the metabolite profiles , indicating a distinct influence of the genetic background on the visible phenotype and the metabolic composition.

using analysis of variance  to extract the metabolites that were differentially abundant among the different subtypes we noted that indica i was characterized by a relatively low abundance of several metabolites including most amino acids and  <dig> of the detected phosphatidylcholines . indica ii and japonica were more similar to each other, differing mainly in the contents of a few of the secondary metabolites such as catechin and trans-4-coumaric acid. with respect to the investigated quality traits, the subtypes exhibited morphological differences; indica i- were more narrow overall than japonica kernels and indica ii- longer than indica i kernels 

metabolite profiles show a fine-grained correlation with genetic variation
our results show a substantial overlap between metabolite profiles and the underlying genetic backgrounds . although of interest for comparing subtypes, this type of large-scale correlation between genotype and phenotype  is obstructive when searching for functional associations with high-level traits  <cit> . using the mantel test  <cit>  with  <dig>  permutations, we examined whether the euclidean distances in metabolite space between different varieties were correlated with their corresponding genetic distances both for the whole rdrs, and for the  <dig> subtypes separately. as expected, the highest significance was observed for the whole dataset  but japonica , indica i , and indica ii  were also significant on their own, indicating the presence of a fine-grained correlation between genetic diversity and metabolite abundances .

mb-opls regression predicts quality traits from metabolic composition
before investigating trait-metabolite correlations we removed the covariance between the trait data and the population membership q-matrix from the structure program by means of multiple linear regression. as confirmed by pca, the resulting data showed no clustering of the  <dig> subtypes . furthermore, the pre-processed traits exhibited highly individual variations, except for kernel size-weight and hull- and kernel width .

while yielding a good metabolomic coverage , multi-platform data may, even after normalization, contain platform-specific biases that have adverse effects on data integration methods. mb-opls was designed to overcome this problem by using the notion that opls also can be used for normalization purposes  <cit> . we estimated mb-opls models for each of the  <dig> traits and diagnosed their predictive performance using the squared correlation coefficient between the true and the seven-fold cross-validation  predicted trait data, rcv <dig> . we furthermore calculated the empirical p-value pcv that assesses the probability of observing an equal or higher rcv <dig> given randomized data. for comparison, we also used the original opls approach on each of the  <dig> data blocks alone. overall, mb-opls performed better than any of the single platforms and predicted  <dig> of the  <dig> traits significantly well . in particular, the models of amylose ratio and ear emergence day were remarkably accurate with rcv2= <dig>  and rcv2= <dig> , respectively. other traits exhibited less reliable but still clearly significant predictions, indicating the existence of subtle but robust trait-metabolite associations. given the strong prediction performance of the models for amylose ratio and ear emergence day, and the high agricultural interest in kernel size, we chose to examine these models more closely .

the opls regression framework, and therefore also mb-opls, provide correlation loadings, pc, that can be used to interpret the relevance of each metabolite for the corresponding prediction. however, this value does not assign any statistical significance in terms of comparison with a postulated null-hypothesis  and the variance of the observed sampling distribution of pc. to address this problem we define a probabilistic statistic for feature selection, log b; it scores how many times more likely the alternative hypothesis is over the null-hypothesis.

when screening for trait-associated metabolites we used both the model-based log b statistic and the nominal spearman's correlation, ρs, as a complementary bivariate method. we extracted the annotated metabolites with log b > <dig> and ρs with an associated false discovery rate  less than  <dig> . we visualized the correlation loadings for all annotated metabolites as word clouds, and listed the top  <dig> selected metabolites in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  the model for amylose ratio is characterized by high negative loadings for several fatty acids as well as choline and putrescine. for ear emergence day, tryptophan and putrescine have large positive loadings. succinate, glucose-6-phosphate, and glycine are all positively correlated with kernel size whereas  <dig> lipids , 18:2-lysopc and 14:0-lysopc) are negatively correlated. a complete list of trait-metabolite associations in given additional file  <dig>  supplementary data  <dig> 

to obtain an overview of the trait-metabolite correlations we constructed a correlation network of the metabolites  for the  <dig> significant models and the germination rate since this trait had border-line significance with pcv < <dig>  for all  <dig> independent datasets. the resulting graph  highlights the strong internal correlations of the fatty acids as well as the high overlap between the metabolites used for the morphological traits . several metabolites, like putrescine, are used for the prediction of more than one trait even in cases where the traits themselves are not correlated .

independent experiment demonstrates robustness of the model of amylose ratio
the model for amylose ratio gave very accurate predictions highlighting a tight correlation between fatty acids and starch synthesis. to confirm the robustness of this model we selected an external set of samples including rice varieties outside the rdrs with known high- , middle- , and low amylose ratios . additionally, we included the  <dig> amylose hyper-accumulating knock-out lines  e <dig>  an ssiiia mutant  and the ssiiia/starch branching enzyme  double mutant  <dig>   <cit> . rice kernels were obtained from different harvests from northern japan   <cit> . the selected natural varieties have high variance in their amylose ratios but all have kernels translucent kernels. the e <dig> mutant manifested a white-core phenotype  <cit>  and the morphology of the  <dig> mutant was almost completely opaque . the amylose ratio was assayed using iodine calorimetry , and metabolite abundances were determined using gc-ms since this platform detects most of the amylose-correlated metabolites . we then fitted a subsetted model for the rdrs data using only the metabolites that had log b > <dig> and were also detected in the follow-up experiment. the obtained model was used to predict the amylose ratio using the new metabolite profile data . of the selected metabolites, glycerol, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, phosphate and putrescine had the highest loadings; all exhibited a negative correlation with the amylose ratio . the prediction performance for the natural varieties was highly significant , but not for the  <dig> knock-out lines that had a similar or even smaller predicted amylose ratio than their background varieties.

discussion
we profiled the metabolomic composition of kernels from the rdrs and investigated trait-metabolite correlations by means of a multi-platform approach. using our multi-block extension of the opls algorithm we found a population structure-independent correlation between metabolite abundances and  <dig> of the  <dig> examined traits. with the majority of these traits being only weakly dependent on each other , this indicates a rich correlation structure and high a information content in the metabolomics data. our study thus confirms, and widely extends, the results shown for arabidopsis thaliana grown under tightly controlled conditions  <cit> , for an important crop species grown under field conditions.

the mb-opls model for amylose ratio indicated very strong negative correlations between the amylose ratio and the abundances of palmitic acid, linoleic acid, glycerol, and putrescine, and positive correlations with 18: <dig> and 14: <dig> lysopc . the two prevalent forms of starch in rice is amylose and amylopectin and a high measured amylose ratio thereby indirectly indicate a low amylopectin ratio. the link between starch-bound fatty acids/lipids has already been observed in rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , on the metabolic- and gene expression level  <cit>  the biochemical function of this connection is unclear.

the rdrs-based model was robust enough to give good predictions for kernels from external varieties from an independent experiment despite unaccounted differences between the growth times and locations . interestingly, the  <dig> knock-out lines were exceptions to the rule of a negative correlation between amylose ratio and fatty acid content. this indicates that the retro-transposon inserts have broken the association with the metabolite composition, and that the link between amylose ratio and fatty acids is under feed-back control. analysis of the biochemical or genetical backgrounds of these correlations was not within the scope of this study but we note that fatty acids and lipids are good starch-complexing agents and their presence influences physicochemical properties  <cit> . in addition, we observed strong differences in kernel phenotype between natural varieties and the two mutants . grain chalkiness is a complicated trait affected by environmental changes  <cit>  and genetic background  <cit> . our results suggest that also fatty acids/lipids have an important function in modulating the texture and structural properties of the stored starch.

the model for the ear emergence day was also very accurate  and gave high weight to putrescine and tryptophan . putrescine is a major amine in rice kernels  <cit>  and has been implicated in the regulation of plant growth and development  <cit> . however, transgenic rice over-expressing a gene encoding a feedback-insensitive α-subunit of rice anthranilate synthase  had increased levels of tryptophan and indole-3-acetate as well as other amino acids in kernels without a significant difference in the ear emergence day  <cit> .

for arabidopsis photosynthetic tissues, it has been shown that biomass is negatively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate and succinate levels  <cit> . keeping in mind that the rice kernel is a strong energy sink with very little own photosynthetic activity, it is not surprising that we instead observed a positive correlation between glucose-6-phosphate and kernel size. this result supports the general idea that energy demand during grain-filling plays an important role in determining kernel size  <cit> . in a brief study of metabolite abundances and kernel sizes using a collection of backcross recombinant inbred lines between kasalath  and koshihikari variety , this pattern was not visible indicating the connection is not generally visible among all genotypes . however, detailed dissection of the genetic background of these patterns is left to a future study.

the model for iron content showed a rather low but still significant predictive performance with rcv2= <dig>  and pcv =  <dig> . however, nicotianamine, known to be involved in iron metabolism  <cit> , was of the few annotated annotated metabolites with log b > <dig> . these results exemplify how metabolic profiling of genetically diverse varieties can reveal functional relationships between molecular factors and important quality traits.

CONCLUSIONS
we summarize the main conclusions as follows.

• the overlap between metabolic and genetic profiles in the rdrs was visible with respect to general subtypes , and fine differences within the more homogeneous populations indica i, indica ii and japonica . this shows that metabotypic- and genotypic-covariance could be detected in a field-grown collection of natural rice cultivars of relatively limited size.

• the metabolic diversity was furthermore found to be associated with  <dig> of the  <dig> studied quality traits  showing that trait-metabolite associations are common, and that they can be uncovered by profiling natural varieties. the resulting network of the trait-associated metabolites provided an overview of the molecular backgrounds of the traits  highlighting known  and novel patterns . from a technical point of view, we conclude that the applied metabolomics platforms were complementary and that integrating the datasets gave overall better prediction performance than achievable with data from any single platform.

• the amylose ratio model showed that trait-metabolite associations can be robust enough to allow for prediction across independent sets of cultivars grown on different occasions in remotely separated fields . a contributing reason for this robustness maybe that the mature kernel has little metabolic activity on its own and is less influenced by environmental factors than e.g. the leaves.

taken together, these results show that metabolomics may be used to factorize important quality traits into distinct genotype-correlated molecular features. these features can both aid physiological interpretation and potentially be used as bridges to identify trait--associated loci. this concept is similar to the current advancements in plant phenomics. there, complex high-level traits are being modeled using sets of simpler traits that have tighter relationships with genetic determinants than the high-level trait itself  <cit> . with metabolomics, traits can be factorized to an even higher resolution that may point directly to underlying genetically-dependent molecular determinants. as genetic data of adequate resolution are currently not available for rdrs, that analysis was not within the scope of our study. however, as such data are anticipated, the value of the dataset presented here is expected to increase.
