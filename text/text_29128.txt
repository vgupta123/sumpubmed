BACKGROUND
as one of the most important crops in the world, the different processing characters of wheat such as milling, baking, and cooking are largely determined by the biochemical composition of the seeds  <cit> . the nutritional profile of the seed is determined by the physiological, biochemical and morphological changes during grain development. some morphogenetic and metabolic processes are exclusively associated with seed maturation. all these fundamental processes are delicately regulated at the level of transcription. therefore, it will be necessary to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms determining grain quality  <cit> , especially those genes whose expression patterns are seed-specific.

the expression level of a candidate gene is commonly estimated using two analysis approaches referred to as 'analog' and 'digital'  <cit> . the analog approach is based on oligonucleotide probe hybridizations such as northern blotting, mrna differential display, and dna microarrays, while the digital approach is based on high-throughput generation of gene transcripts as in the case of expressed sequence tags .

cdna microarrays, corresponding to the analog approach, are used to provide a comprehensive description of transcript level in an organism after perturbation or during development  <cit> . they have been widely used in studying the biological processes during grain growth and filling in cereals  <cit> . for wheat they have also been extensively used to analyze the expression of genes involved in the development of seed  <cit> . however, not all labs have the ability to perform microarray analysis. the publicly available microarray resources allow scientists to gain comprehensive information and knowledge of gene expression profiles in particular tissues and organs at different developmental stages.

ddd corresponding to the digital approach is an online bioinformatics tool for identification of differentially expressed genes based on the relative abundance of ests from various libraries, or pools of libraries, represented in unigene  <cit> . to eliminate the difference caused by the unequal number of ests in each selected libraries, ddd uses the fisher exact test  <cit>  to restrict the output for statistically significant differences . this approach has proven to be very useful in the study of organ-specific genes in mammal  <cit>  and cancer cells  <cit> . despite these works, some work of in silico expression studies have been conducted in wheat  <cit> . the deposition of the generated gene transcripts in public databases provides a valuable tool for in silico analysis of organ specific expressed genes.

determination of genes involved in seed development and their functions is one of the major goals in plant developmental biology. in the current work, genes specifically expressed in wheat seeds were screened and identified by using ddd, together with the available online microarray databases. these wheat seed-specific genes were also compared with rice genome to examine whether the expression patterns of homology gene groups involved in seed development are conserved between wheat and rice.

RESULTS
ddd
ddd comparison between seed libraries and non-seed libraries was used to identify unigene sets that were seed-specific. the libraries chosen for comparison were released on july  <dig>   <dig> . following the formula mentioned in the methods, four hundred and seven unigene sets differentially expressed in selected libraries were retrieved. among them,  <dig>  unigenes were characterized gene models , and  <dig>  unigenes had no corresponding protein of known function but show similarity  to proteins of other species . in addition, the other  <dig>  unigenes represented unknown transcripts gene models . according to cluster sizes , their expression abundance was classified into different levels, each level contains various amount of unigenes . from figure  <dig>  it is clear that the ratio of the cg gene models is high when the size of unigene is large. in other words, it is more likely to characterize the unigene when the cluster size is large.

the details for the libraries were listed in additional file  <dig> 

identification of genes specifically expressed in seeds using microarray data
based on extensive est collections, affymetrix genechip platforms have now been developed for wheat  <cit> . the microarray data for the genes screened above with ddd were searched against plexdb   <cit> . a total of  <dig> probesets corresponding to  <dig>  unigenes were analyzed here. to better assess the data, a heat map was generated through the genepattern program   <cit>  . figure  <dig> indicated that not all probesets showed specific expression in seeds. the probesets with expression levels significantly higher in seeds than any other organs  were chosen for further analysis. finally,  <dig> probesets corresponding to  <dig> unigenes were selected . among them,  <dig>  were cg gene models,  <dig>  were sg gene models and the other  <dig>  were ug gene models. furthermore, among the  <dig> unigenes, most  showed specificity in the  <dig> dpa caryopsis , while  <dig> unigenes showed specificity in the 3- <dig> dpa caryopsis.

microarray-alone analysis was also performed to screen probsets corresponding to genes with seed-specific expression. the  <dig> probsets screened above were used as "seeds" to find seed-specific genes in wheat microarrays. the searching tool was "profile neighbors" in plexdb   <cit> . one hundred and seventy-four additional probsets were retrieved by removing the redundant information and probsets with expression profiles that were not seed-specific. the est profiles were also screened for the unigenes corresponding to the  <dig> probesets. however,  <dig> of the corresponding unigenes were not for seed-specific ests.

go enrichment analysis
further go enrichment analysis was performed for the  <dig> seed-specific unigenes through goeast . goeast is a web based software providing easy to use, visualizable, comprehensive and unbiased gene ontology  analysis   <cit> . the details of the enrichment are listed in table . most of the unigenes were assigned into several categories, including stress response, defense response, multi-organism process, pathogenesis, extracellular region, nutrient reservoir activity, enzyme inhibitor activity, antioxidant activity and oxidoreductase activity .

according to the expression specificity analysis results,  <dig> of  <dig> unigenes were specially expressed in the 3- <dig> dpa caryopsis. at 3- <dig> dpa, the caryopsis is at the coenocytic stage during which free nuclear division occurs within the primary endosperm cell to give a coenocytes. in wheat, over  <dig> nuclei will be generated within  <dig> hours after fertilization  <cit> . during this stage the seed is far from mature and has not begun accumulating grain storage molecules. this explains why the  <dig> unigenes whose expressions were specific in the 3- <dig> dpa caryopsis didn't contain any storage protein transcripts. meanwhile,  <dig>  unigenes were found to be specifically expressed in the  <dig> dpa caryopsis. during the grain filling stage  the major metabolic activity is the synthesis and accumulation of storage molecules such as starch and protein. therefore, the genes belonging to the "nutrient reservoir" category all represented in this stage. ten genes, which have specificity in the  <dig> dpa caryopsis, were found in the category of "response to stress". this is consistent with the result of becerra et al.  <cit>  who found  <dig> genes specially expressed in the arabidopsis seed that were involved in response to abiotic stress, which clearly indicated the importance of genes contributing to stress-tolerance during seed development. interestingly, there are also  <dig> genes with function annotation as "serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity" showed specific expression in the  <dig> dpa caryopsis. three genes of this category encode serpins, which are inhibitors of exogenous proteinases ; play important roles in the defence of specific cell types of vegetative tissues  <cit> . another three genes encode alpha-amylase inhibitor which plays a similar role as protease inhibitors and protect cereal seed from the attack by endogenous hydrolase  <cit> . thus, during the filling stage, in addition to transcript accumulation of genes encoding storage protein, genes involved in protecting the main nutritional resource of the developing seeds from endogenous as well as exogenous attack are also seed-specific and active.

the expression patterns of homologous gene groups in rice
both rice and wheat belong to the plant family gramineae and rice is the best-characterized experimental model for monocot plants. further more, these two species are evolutionarily related. to investigate whether the expression patterns of homologous gene groups involved in seed development are conserved between wheat and rice, the  <dig> unigenes which showed seed-specific in wheat were compared with homologous genes in rice. for some unigenes, no significant homology was found in the rice genome, while for others, more than one unigene corresponded to the same homologous gene in rice. in the end,  <dig>  unigenes corresponding to  <dig> putative homologous genes in rice were inferred based on sequence similarity. to facilitate the comparison of  <dig> homologous genes between wheat and rice, they were divided into three categories as follows:  <dig> gene models with high similarity ,  <dig> gene models with moderate similarity  and  <dig> gene models with weak similarity  to their counterpart genes.

to examine whether the three gene models have a seed-specific expression pattern in rice, the ids of probesets representing the homologous genes and the microarray data presenting on the affymetrix rice genome array were retrieved using an online tool of internet based database - rice multi-platform microarray search tool   <cit> . a total  <dig> homologous sequences were detected, while  <dig> of the  <dig> homologous sequences had no corresponding probe on the rice arrays. hierarchical clustering analysis based on array data had also been carried out . the results indicate that the expression patterns of homologous gene groups are conserved at different degrees between wheat and rice. though not all the analyzed genes showed seed-specificity in rice, a large percentage of corresponding genes in each gene models were specially expressed in the seed of rice. genes are defined as seed-specific only if their expression levels in the seed is significant higher  than that in any other organs. finally, the rice counterparts of  <dig> out of  <dig>  hs gene models,  <dig> out of  <dig>  ms gene models, and  <dig> out of  <dig>  ws gene models were all found to be seed-specific. the results also indicated that the percentage of seed-specific genes among hs, ms and ws gene models both differed and were lower where less sequence similarity occurs.

in order to assess the quality of the list, we also performed a sensitivity analysis. seventy genes were identified as seed-specific in rice by the same method  which was used in wheat. meanwhile, microarray-alone analysis in rice was also performed using the same method applied in wheat and  <dig> probsets were screened as seed-specific genes. the libraries chosen for ddd comparison were released on apr  <dig>   <dig> . the  <dig> seed-specific genes in rice were compared with the genome of wheat and  <dig>  homologous genes were found. among the  <dig> homologous genes in wheat,  <dig> were seed-specific and detected in the list of  <dig> wheat seed-specific unigenes screened here.

as for the various datasets of seed-specific genes screened by ddd-alone, microarray-alone and ddd + microarray, the qualities of these lists were all evaluated by the specificity  and sensitivity  analysis . it is clear that both specificity and sensitivity were higher in ddd + microarray analysis than any single analysis. and the number of replicate genes does not drastically reduce in the ddd + microarray comparing to the other two lists.

spec = % of wheat seed genes replicating in rice, sens = % of rice seed-specific genes replicating in wheat. the amount of genes of each seed-specific gene list is  <dig> for ddd-alone,  <dig> for microarray-alone and  <dig> for ddd + microarray in wheat;  <dig> for ddd-alone,  <dig> for microarray-alone and  <dig> for ddd + microarray in rice.

go enrichment analysis was also performed for the  <dig> seed-specific genes in rice through the goeast  <cit>  . the result showed that most rice seed-specific genes were also associated with oxidation-reduction process, response to stress, defense response, envelope, extracellular region, nutrient reservoir activity and enzyme inhibitor activity. these results suggest that most of the seed-special genes in both wheat and rice have shared functions.

experimental validation of the expression patterns of  <dig> selected unigenes by qrt-pcr
to confirm the results of ddd and microarray screening, ten unignes were selected for validation of their expression specificity with quantitative real-time pcr . two transcripts , which were previously shown to have consistent expression across samples, were chosen as internal controls for all the data normalization  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were randomly selected from the cg gene models generated by both ddd and microarray selection , two were randomly selected from the group generated by ddd based selection but without microarray data . all of the eight genes tested by qrt-pcr showed the same seed specificity as in silico analysis. meanwhile, the other two genes which didn't follow the formula used in the ddd selection, that is the rations in poolb were indicated as < <dig>  while the sum of ests in poola is less than  <dig> times than that in poolb, were also selected for qrt-pcr analysis . the results showed that none of the two genes showed seed specificity.

discussion
this study demonstrates that ddd combined with microarray data, is an effective method to identify and analyze genes specifically expressed in the developing seed of wheat. becerra et al.  <cit>  used est virtual subtraction combined with microarray data analysis to discover arabidopsis genes specifically expressed in immature seeds. eujayl et al.  <cit>  identified differentially expressed unigenes in developing wheat seeds of various species and different stages using only ddd analysis. in eujayl's study, apart from seed storage genes, other  <dig> unigenes were identified as seed-specific, although, only  <dig> unigenes were described in their report. among the  <dig> unigenes which were reported,  <dig> were included in our result of  <dig> unigenes. as for the remaining part,  <dig> unigenes had been retired from the database,  <dig> had no microarray data and the other  <dig> unigenes were shown not to be seed-specific by the microarray data.

the expression level of a gene is commonly estimated using two analysis approaches referred to as 'analog' and 'digital'. to identify seed-specific genes in wheat, both of these approaches were used in our study. among the  <dig> unigenes preliminarily screened by ddd, there are  <dig> cg gene models encoding the wheat storage proteins such as gliadin, glutentin, triticin and avenin. there are also two other cg gene models encoding late embryogenesis abundant  proteins which are the most abundantly expressed proteins in the seeds. since the accumulation of seed storage proteins and lea proteins are both highly seed-specific processes  <cit> , the coverage of these genes with known tissue specificity demonstrates the feasibility of ddd methods in wheat. however, because of the limitation of the quantity and diversity of ests in wheat, the results of single ddd screening were not entirely accurate. in our study,  <dig> unigenes were proved to be not seed-specific by microarray analysis while they were identified as seed-specific during ddd analysis. similarly, there were also certain false positives rates in the microarray-alone analysis. while  <dig> genes were identified as seed specific in microarray analysis, the corresponding est profiles suggest they were actually expressed in tissues other than seeds too. to make the results more reliable, apart from the ddd analysis, the combined analysis with microarray data was also necessary to screen seed-specific genes in wheat. finally a total of  <dig> unigenes as an intersection of these two methods were identified for further study.

cross-species comparisons with model species oryza sativa were used to test the specificity of the data. the results showed that  <dig>  homologous genes were seed-specific in rice as indicated by the microarray data. among the  <dig> genes above,  <dig> were detected in the list of  <dig> genes retrieved by the method of ddd + microarray. the results have three indications: first, a large number of genes with seed related functions may have diverged within monocots, because approximately 40% of the wheat seed-specific proteins surveyed in the study produced no significant blastp hits in the rice protein database. for instance, the gliadins produce no hits within rice proteins, consistent with the variation in the predominant storage protein type in cereals, which are gliadins in wheat and glutelins in rice  <cit> . second, partial seed-specific genes among rice and wheat are functionally conserved, possibly similar in other species. these results could serve as reference for identifying seed-specific genes in other crops. third, the fact that 63% of the identified homologs were also specifically expressed in the seeds of rice provides further validation of the methods used in the current study. additionally, reverse analysis of sensitivity test were also done to assess the quality of the data. genes that have been identified as seed-specific in rice were searched to find their counterparts in wheat and  <dig>  homologous genes were identified. among the  <dig> wheat homologs  <dig> were proven to be seed-specific and detected in the list of  <dig> unigenes retrieved in the first place. further go enrichment analysis showed that most of the go terms of rice seed-specific genes were similar to those of wheat. similarly, the specificity and sensitivity analysis were also done for the lists of seed-specific genes screened by ddd-alone and microarray-alone . it is clear that compared to the single analysis of microarray or ddd, the intersection of these two methods is more reliable and does not drastically reduce coverage. the reliability analysis and similar function ontology further proved the validity of the method.

to further confirm the results of in-silico analysis,  <dig> unigenes strictly following the selection formula were randomly selected from cg gene models of the  <dig> unigenes for qrt-pcr analysis. again, the results showed that all  <dig> of the selected genes were specifically expressed in developing seeds. two unigenes, which did awkward of ddd selection, but have significant expression in the pool of seeds compared to the contrast pool, were found to be not seed-specific. all the above evidences indicated the selection methods used in this study are stringent and effective for screening for the seed-specific genes in wheat.

during the analysis, it is worthily noticed that not all the unigenes screened by ddd have corresponding probeset. there are three major reasons for this. firstly, microarray data available for wheat are still limited and less openly accessible. second, given the size and complexity of wheat genome, the wheat affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® can only cover a limited number of genes on wheat genomes. thirdly, due to the frequent update of the unigene database, some unigene clusters were retrieved, the ests in the clusters might be retracted or distributed to other new clusters , and the microarray data couldn't catch up with the update of unigenes, so there will be lots of unigenes have no corresponding probesets. because of the limitation, the number of seed-specific genes identified with the combined methods could be less than the actual numbers. for instance,  <dig> unigenes screened by ddd without corresponding probsets were rejected during the selection, were actually proven by qrt-pcr to be seed-specific . despite these challenges, microarray data provides valuable information for the validation of the ddd screening results, especially for the genes with corresponding specific probsets.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated the utilization of digital differential display  as a tool, combined with microarray data, to identify seed-specific unigenes in wheat. a total of  <dig> seed-specific unigenes were retrieved by this method, and the specificity of these genes was then confirmed by the comparative genomics and qrt-pcr. all the data demonstrated that this is an effective, rapid and economical strategy to identify seed-specific genes in wheat. it could also be applied to other plant species for example maize, barley, soybean, loblolly pine, etc. these seed-specific genes screened in the study could also be candidates involved in wheat growth and seed development.
