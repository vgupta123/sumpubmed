BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis  is a major swine pathogen responsible for severe economic losses in the pork industry and is emerging as an important threat to human health, especially to people who have close contact with swine or pork by-products  <cit> . since the first reported case of human meningitis caused by s. suis in denmark in  <dig>  cases of infection have been reported continuously in more than  <dig> countries, with more than  <dig> people being affected  <cit> . two recent large-scale outbreaks of human s. suis infections in china  have raised awareness of the existing threat to public health  <cit> . the infection has also caused sporadic human illness in other countries, including thailand  <cit> , the united kingdom  <cit> , portugal  <cit> , italy  <cit> , japan  <cit> , australia  <cit> , the netherlands  <cit>  and the united states  <cit> .

s. suis is an encapsulated gram-positive coccus that possesses cell wall antigenic determinants, similar to lancefield group d  <cit> . among the  <dig> serotypes that have been classified based on the composition of their capsular polysaccharides , only a limited number are responsible for infections in pigs, including serotypes 1- <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . although the distribution of different serotypes varies depending on the geographical origins of the strains, s. suis serotype  <dig>  is considered the most pathogenic and the most prevalent capsular type among diseased pigs, followed by serotypes  <dig> and 1/ <dig>  <cit> . serotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also prevalent in several european  <cit>  and asian countries  <cit> . serotype  <dig> infections in humans are now being reported with increasing frequency  <cit> . however, little information about these prevalent serotypes is available, except for serotype  <dig>  comparative genomic analysis is a powerful method for exploring the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes and for discovering genetic markers for clinical purposes.

a previous comparative genomic study based on examination of an intermediately pathogenic strain , a highly pathogenic strain  and an epidemic strain  indicates that acquiring particular genomic islands is essential for the evolution of highly pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , and a specific pathogenic island  is found to be an essential component of virulent chinese ss <dig> isolates  <cit> . a recent study indicates that the pathogenic island  can exhibit spontaneous excision to form an extrachromosomal circular product, which can then undergo lateral transfer to a recipient strain through site-specific recombination  <cit> . to understand the evolution of virulence in other prevalent serotypes, it is important to know whether they could also harbor recombinant target sites and serve as recipients for exogenous sequences.

in this study, we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> prevalent s. suis serotypes:  <dig>  1/ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  by taking the publicly available complete genome sequences of serotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as the reference, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to provide a global genomic characterization of this prevalent pathogenic bacterium. acquisitions and losses of genome components were identified, and different genes involved in cps biosynthesis were found to be serotype determinants. the study also indicated that serotypes 1/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but not serotype  <dig>  could supply a recombinant site for a pathogenic island  mediated by conjugal transfer, which suggests that these serotypes are able to obtain the  <dig> k sequence and thus become more virulent.

RESULTS
general features of the sequenced genomes
among the  <dig> known serotypes, serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1/ <dig> are the most prevalent in pigs, and the strains causing human infections were also found among these serotypes  <cit> . although  <dig> genome sequences of strains from serotype  <dig> were available, there was little information about the other serotypes, except for our recently updated genome sequences for serotypes  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, whole genome sequencing was performed on  <dig> prevalent chinese s. suis strains belonging to serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1/ <dig>  each of the  <dig> genomes was sequenced to a high level of redundancy . we filtered low-quality reads and used only high-quality reads for assembly. reads for each genome were assembled into scaffolds, with  <dig> to  <dig> large scaffolds  obtained per genome. then scaffolds were aligned to the published genomes of s. suis to obtain linkage information for gap closure. all  <dig> annotated complete genomes were deposited in genbank.

every genome consisted of a single circular chromosome with an approximate size of  <dig> mb . genome and assembly statistics for each strain were summarized in table  <dig>  the number of predicted orfs for the  <dig> sequenced genomes was ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and approximately 71% of the orfs was assigned biological functions. the average gene length varied among different strains and was related to the number of pseudogenes and truncated genes presented. the genome of strain d <dig>  carried the greatest number of disrupted genes , and conversely, ss <dig>  carried the lowest number  . the average gc content was  <dig> %, which was consistent with previous studies  <cit> , and the genomic regions exhibiting an aberrant gc content may be the sites of horizontal gene transfer in different strains. additionally, several is elements were identified, and the number of is elements was found to be similar to that of previously sequenced strains, such as p1/ <dig>  sc <dig> and bm <dig> 

identification of gene clusters
all cdss from the  <dig> completely sequenced s. suis genomes used for clustering were available in multi-fasta format in the supplemental material . there were  <dig> s. suis orthologous gene clusters and  <dig> unique genes, and the observed pan-genome shared by the  <dig> strains consisted of  <dig> genes. the core genome of these strains comprised  <dig> genes, accounting for  <dig> % of total cdss, and  <dig> % of the genes were "dispensable" because they were shared by at least  <dig> strains, but not by all. all of the unique genes from these genomes only accounted for  <dig> % of genes, but the percentage in each strain varied considerably . non-core genes, including both dispensable genes and unique genes, usually play roles in nonessential metabolism and are more associated with virulence, environmental adaptation or serotype determination than core genes. strain d <dig> possessed the highest proportion of non-core genes , and strain p1/ <dig> had the lowest proportion . this may reflect different levels of gene gain and loss during the evolution of these strains or serotypes. pairwise gene content comparisons among the  <dig> genomes indicated that the number of genes involved in gain and loss events between the strains was  <dig> on average. the largest number of gene difference between the strains was  <dig>  which was identified between strains d <dig> and 05zyh <dig>  and the minimum was  <dig>  identified between strains p1/ <dig> and sc <dig>  a cog functional classification for core and non-core genes was performed, and the results showed that non-core genes were most likely to be assigned to categories, such as carbohydrate transport and metabolism, replication, recombination and repair, whereas core genes were more often associated with translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis . genes involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis lipid transport and metabolic functions were much less prevalent among non-core genes, while defense-related genes were more likely to be found among the core genes.

core and pan-genome analysis of s. suis
s. suis core genome
to determine the core genome of s. suis, the number of conserved genes found upon sequential addition of each new genome was extrapolated by fitting a decaying function that was considered to provide the best fit to the dataset . although the number of core genes initially decreased with the addition of each new genome, the core genome appeared to reach a plateau at approximately  <dig> genes for s. suis species. the core gene number in each genome varied slightly because of the involvement of duplicated genes and paralogs in the shared clusters.

s. suis pan-genome analysis
to determine whether the s. suis pan-genome was open, the number of new genes  was calculated every time a new genome was incorporated. as expected, the observed numbers varied greatly, as shown in figure 4b. the large deviation from the mean suggested high levels of variation within s. suis. the mean values of new genes were used to perform the extrapolation. similar to the core genes, the plot of new genes was fit well by a decaying function, and remarkably, the extrapolated curve reached an asymptotic value of  <dig>  which meant that every newly sequenced genome could bring  <dig> new genes on average, even if many genomes were sequenced. this finding revealed that the species possesses an open pan-genome for which the size increases with the addition of new sequenced strains . this was consistent with a previous study on the core and pan-genome of streptococcus, which indicated that s. suis was the lineage with the largest number of gene gains and losses  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships among different serotype strains
we used two methods to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among different serotypes, one of which was based on gene presence or absence among different strains, while the other one utilized the concatenated sequence of all single-copy core genes with exactly identical lengths from the  <dig> complete genomes. figure 5a displays the phylogenetic relationships among the different strains based on the large sequence alignment of  <dig> core genes with the same length in each cluster. with the exception of serotype  <dig> strain js <dig> and serotype 1/ <dig> strain ss <dig>  the non-serotype  <dig> strains appeared to be phylogenetically distinct from the serotype  <dig> strains, and could be assigned to a common clade. in this clade, serotype  <dig> strain d <dig> and serotype  <dig> strain st <dig> were more closely related than any other pair. all serotype  <dig> strains presented an extremely short evolutionary distance from each other, indicating that these strains were probably derived from a recent common ancestor. it can also be inferred that phylogenetically serotype 1/ <dig> and serotype  <dig> may be more closely related to the serotype  <dig> strains than the other  <dig> serotypes. however, to confirm this, more strains of other serotypes need to be sequenced. figure 5b shows that the upgma  phylogenetic tree reflect the number of gene gains and losses between all pairs of the  <dig> strains. the topologies of the mrbayes tree and the upgma tree bore some similarities. the  <dig> strains from serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also included in a common branch and differed greatly from the serotype  <dig> strains, whereas the serotype 1/ <dig> and  <dig> strains were grouped into the same clade with a <dig> and gz <dig> from serotype  <dig>  the main difference between the two trees was that the two chinese isolates, 05zyh <dig> and 98hah <dig>  were more evolutionarily distant from the other serotype  <dig> strains indicated in the upgma tree.

genomic arrangement of s. suis strains
a global multi-genome alignment of all  <dig> complete genomes was performed, and the results showed that some rearrangement occurred . these genomes could be classified into  <dig> categories according to their collinearity. all serotype  <dig> strains except for bm <dig>  as well as the serotype  <dig> strain js <dig> and serotype 1/ <dig> strain ss <dig>  were quite similar with respect to genome structure, with the exception of some small insertions. the genomes of bm <dig>  d <dig> and st <dig> shared a similar synteny with each other, and they displayed a large inversion when compared to that of other serotype  <dig> strains. the d <dig> and st <dig> genomes were collinear along their length, with the exception of an insertion in the d <dig> genome. this is interesting because these synteny types were similar to some extent to the phylogenetic relationships seen among these strains.

genes involved in cps biosynthesis
s. suis is surrounded by a capsule that has been shown to be essential for its virulence  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the presence of the capsule can decrease the activation of the pi-3k/akt/pkcα signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis processes  <cit>  and allows the bacterium to escape being killed by both macrophages and neutrophils  <cit> . the antigenic properties of capsular polysaccharides are the basis for serotype characterization. only the structure of the serotype  <dig> capsular polysaccharide had previously been determined, and the genes involved in the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides had been found to be clustered in a single locus  <cit> . orf2y and orf2z are located upstream of the operon and may be involved in the regulation of these cps genes. most of the serotypes include these two genes, as determined by hybrid assays  <cit> , and the genome sequences indicate that these genes share very high sequence similarity. at the cps locus, the orfx and cpsa to cpsd genes could be hybridized in most serotypes  <cit> , and these genes presented in all sequenced serotypes strains and highly conserved, indicating that they were involved in common functions related to the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharides, such as regulation, chain length determination and export, which were the functions of the homologous genes in streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . the other  <dig> genes at the locus may be responsible for its specific cps structure . the agglutination test indicated that the serotype 1/ <dig> strains could react with hyperimmune sera against serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig>  and the sequenced genes encoding the cps biosynthetic enzymes of serotype 1/ <dig> showed high uniformity compared to serotype  <dig>  suggesting that the modifications of the cps of serotype 1/ <dig> were similar to those of serotype  <dig>  corresponding to the findings of a previous report  <cit> , the genes coding for the cps biosynthetic enzymes of serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were highly conserved, indicating that the determinants for both serotypes include not only cps structure, but also the modifications of polysaccharides .

the prevalent serotypes supply a potential recombinant site for a pathogenic island 
the two large-scale outbreaks in china in  <dig> and  <dig> prompted researchers to determine which changes in the s. suis genome make it so highly virulent. using comparative genomic analysis, an 89-kb sequence was identified only in the chinese epidemic strain  <cit> . the subsequent investigation indicated that the 89-kb represented a gi-type t4ss-mediated horizontal transfer of a pathogenicity island that could be transferred to the recipient strain through a 15-bp sequence specific recombination event, although the transfer could be successfully observed only to serotype  <dig>  <cit> . because the 89-kb harbored necessary elements for horizontal transfer, such as integrase, excisionase, dna relaxase and so on, suggesting that this pathogenicity island maintained the potential to transfer to the recipient strain harboring the 15-bp sequence. the genomic analysis indicated that the pathogenicity island did not exist in the other sequenced prevalent serotypes and such a 15-bp sequence could be found in the genomes of sequenced serotypes 1/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but not in serotype  <dig>  more surprisingly, the flanking sequence structure of the  <dig> k region in the epidemic strain sc <dig> showed high similarity with the other sequenced serotypes, suggesting that these prevalent serotypes harboring the site for homologous recombination  would have the potential to act as recipient strains for the pathogenic island from the epidemic strain.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, comparative genomic analysis using genome sequences originating from prevalent s. suis serotypes showed that the observed pan genome of s. suis consists of  <dig> gene clusters composed of  <dig> core genome genes,  <dig> distributed genes and  <dig> strain-specific genes. the species possesses an open pan-genome and is the streptococcus lineage with the greatest number of gene gains and losses. the results of this study also indicate that the other serotypes could supply a recombinant site for a pathogenic island  mediated by conjugal transfer, which suggests that these serotypes have the potential to obtain an  <dig> k sequence, and thus become more virulent. our findings could be contributed to a better understanding of the genomics of s. suis.
