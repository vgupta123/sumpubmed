BACKGROUND
the japanese ocean is special because of its ranges of latitude and depth. there are many deep-sea trenches and troughs with approximately 80% of the seafloor lying below 1000 m. the japan trench and nankai trough are part of the pacific ring of fire where submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal vents are present along the tectonic plates. two major sea surface currents, cold  from the north and warm  from the south, flow along the pacific coast of japan and meet at the japan trench. these factors have contributed to the high diversity of marine species in the region  <cit> . marine environments include some of the most diverse sets of microorganisms that have important roles in both biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems  <cit> .

polyhydroxyalkanoate  is naturally produced by many bacteria and some archaea under stressful or unbalanced nutritional conditions when there is an excessive supply of carbon sources  <cit> . this polymer can be used for bio-based and biodegradable plastic. three major enzymes that are involved in the pha biosynthetic pathway are β-ketothiolase , nadp-dependent acetoacetyl-coa reductase  and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase . phac , the key enzyme involved in the polymerization process, determines the types of monomers  incorporated into the pha polymer chain based on the enzyme’s substrate specificity  <cit> .

phacs are categorized into four classes according to the subunits present and the substrate specificity  <cit> . most of the pha producers make class i and ii phacs. primers targeting different classes of phac are available, e.g. general primers for class i and ii  <cit> , class ii specific  <cit> , class iii for haloarchaea  <cit>  and desulfococcus  <cit> , and class iv for bacillus spp.  <cit> . although all the phacs share some common amino acid residues, it is not yet possible to amplify all four classes of phac with a single primer set. the general primers targeted to class i and ii phacs cover a wider range of bacterial genera  compared to the specific primer sets that target class iii and iv phacs.

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to identify phac diversity from seawater from different depths using a culture-independent approach. in this study, we decided to use the class i and ii general primers  <cit>  to identify novel phacs from seawater. seawater samples as deep as 3000 m and 5000 m were collected from the nankai trough and japan trench, respectively. this study also serves as the first trial using a whole genome amplification and genome walking approach  <cit>  to determine the complete coding dna sequence  of unstudied phac genes followed by evaluation of phac activity for pha production in cupriavidus necator phbˉ <dig> .

RESULTS
pha synthase fragments from whole genome amplified seawater dna
a total of  <dig> partial putative phac clones were obtained from the seawater whole genome amplified  dna. twenty-one clones did not show any similarity with phacs in the genbank protein sequences database using the blastx program and were excluded from subsequent analysis. the remaining  <dig> clones that contained the putative conserved domain superfamilies “phac_n” were classified into  <dig> different genetic groups  based on a cut off of 90% nucleotide sequence similarity. seven clones containing an internal stop codon ‘tag’ within the coding region of the putative phac were hypothesized to be pseudogenes. three ggs  were comprised solely of these pseudogenes.

eighteen i-ggs and two ii-ggs phacs were detected using the phac degenerate primer sets g-d and g-1r. these ggs were designated as “phac-i” or “phac-ii” depending on the similarity with class i or class ii phacs, respectively. this grouping generated similar results to the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree , where clones designated as the same “gg” were closely clustered in the same branch. for all the ggs, a putative lipase box  was identified from a muscle alignment . the only exceptions were i-gg <dig> and i-gg <dig> in which the first amino acid residue ‘glycine ’ in the lipase box motif was replaced by ‘serine ’ and ‘alanine ’, respectively. in addition, three amino acid residues, serine , aspartic acid  and tryptophan , that were conserved in the previously reported multiple sequence alignment of phac  <cit>  were also present in all ggs.

the protein sequence identities of  <dig> partial phac fragments against the genbank protein sequences database ranged from 57% to 99% . there were five putative phac-ggs with very high identity matches : i-gg <dig>  ii-gga and ii-ggb to known pha producers from the genera chromobacterium  and pseudomonas , and i-gg <dig> and i-gg <dig> to unknown pha producers from gamma proteobacterium himb <dig> and genus marinobacter, respectively .figure  <dig>

another four putative phac-ggs  with blastx identity matches between 71-83% showed relatively close phylogenetic clustering with the phacs from the genera rhodospirillum, acetobacteraceae bacterium, oceanibaculum and oceanicaulis, respectively. the genus rhodospirillum has a known pha producer, rhodospirillum rubrum  <cit> , while the other genera include phac genes annotated from the bacterial whole genome sequence . the remaining  <dig> putative phac-ggs  that showed relatively distinct phylogenetic clusters when compared with the phac from cultured bacteria are believed to derive from yet uncultured bacteria.

phac from culture-independent studies
further comparison was carried out by compiling our phac fragments and all predicted phac fragments including unpublished data from various culture-independent studies  . since our phac fragments belonged to class i and ii, we only compared these two classes. in total, there are  <dig> putative phac genes in the genbank nucleotide sequences database . putative phac genes with nucleotide sequence similarity >90% were assigned to the same genetic group.

the study on activated-sludge phac diversity  <cit>  generated the largest number of partial phac sequences with most of them belonging to class i phac of betaproteobacteria, followed by class i phac of alphaproteobacteria and class ii phac of gammaproteobacteria. the same dominant group, class i phac of betaproteobacteria, was found in oil-contaminated soil dna  <cit> , followed by class ii phac of gammaproteobacteria and class i phac of alphaproteobacteria. in contrast, class i phac of alphaproteobacteria was more dominant in the seawater dna, followed by class i phac of betaproteobacteria, and class i and ii phac of gammaproteobacteria. on the other hand, three complete cdss of class i phac of alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were isolated from the soil dna genomic library  <cit> . our seawater samples contained a higher proportion  of novel or uncharacterized phac fragments compared with samples from other environments.

isolation of complete coding region of phac gene
the complete coding regions of three class i ggs were determined via in silico assembly of dna fragments obtained by inverse affinity nested pcr  . these i-ggs were selected based on their low , medium  and high  partial protein sequence identities with phac from the unknown pha producers deposited in the genbank protein sequences database . the length of the i-gg <dig> genome walking dna fragment was 3878 bp. the downstream region showed close protein similarity with mfs permease  followed by peroxidase . the upstream region could not be determined due to the presence of an ecori restriction digestion site. this could be an incomplete cds of a protein with approximately  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues missing at the n-terminal end based on multiple sequence alignment analysis . the length of the i-gg <dig> genome walking dna fragment was 3157 bp. the downstream region showed close protein similarity with the tetr family transcriptional regulator . the length of the i-gg <dig> genome walking dna fragment was 3885 bp . we were only able to obtain the upstream region of the phac based on blastn similarity searches. nonetheless, there was a high identity match  with pha synthase and the upstream region  of marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus atcc  <dig>  therefore, a reverse primer was designed based on the hypothetical protein located downstream of the phac of marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus atcc  <dig> figure  <dig>

the complete cdss of i-gg <dig>  i-gg <dig> and i-gg <dig> were confirmed by dna sequencing and their closest phac matches from blastx analysis were oceanibaculum indicum , tistrella mobilis  and marinobacter sp. c1s <dig> , respectively . high nucleotide sequence similarities  were observed between the partial phac genes and their corresponding complete cdss obtained by the genome walking method. the primary structure of the three putative complete phac cdss indicated the presence of a lipase box motif. in addition, eight highly conserved amino acid residues were also present in these putative phacs  based on observations reported in a previous study  <cit> .table  <dig>

discussion
unexplored pha synthases from the japan trench and nankai trough
the japan trench and nankai trough have unique environmental features, one of them is their seawater temperature which is influenced by surface currents and depth  <cit> . pha producers have been isolated from various marine-associated environments  <cit> , however, there are no previous reports on the study of pha synthase from the japan trench and nankai trough. a degenerate primer set  targeting class i and ii phacs developed by romo et al.  <cit>  was used in this study. we successfully isolated  <dig> partial phac fragments and classified them into  <dig> ggs  for both class i and ii phacs from whole genome amplified  seawater dna.

in this study,  <dig> putative phac-ggs showed relatively low sequence identity  and distinct phylogenetic lineage with the phacs from known pha producers. we hypothesized that these phac-ggs are derived from yet uncultured bacteria. in addition, four putative phac-ggs that showed high sequence similarity  with annotated phacs from unknown pha producers . in total,  <dig> new or uncharacterized putative phac-ggs  were discovered from the wga seawater dna examined in this study.

novel bacterial species have been discovered from the deep sea of both the japan trench and the nankai trough  <cit> . indeed, the microbial biosphere in deep-sea environments is surprisingly diverse  <cit> . to date, the occurrence of pha producers in deep-sea water that have been reported include moritella sp.  and shewanella sp.  from the pacific ocean  <cit> , halomonas profundus  from the mid atlantic ridge  <cit>  and pseudoaltermonas sp.  from bohai sea sediment  <cit> . four sites located between the depths of 1000 m and 5373 m were sampled in this study. a total of five putative phac-ggs  were identified from these deep-sea regions. two putative phac-ggs obtained from 3000 m and 5373 m had very high sequence identity to known pha producers from chromobacterium sp.  and pseudomonas sp. , respectively. we conclude that the occurrence of these clones was not due to experimental contamination because of the presence of non-random nucleotide mismatches. most of these nucleotide mismatches occurred at third codon positions encoding for the same amino acids or functionally similar amino acid side groups. neither of these genera has been reported previously to be deep-sea pha producers. nevertheless, several pseudomonas sp. have been isolated from deep-sea environments  <cit> , and isolates from the genus chromobacterium have been found in the southern ocean below 200 m  <cit> . the remaining three putative phac-ggs were found to be conserved in water columns from different depths with clones detected in both shallow  and deep seawater . we speculate that these three are derived from non-cultured bacteria due to their distinct phylogenetic lineage with known pha producers.

we also attempted to examine the functionality of three uncharacterized putative phac-ggs from the wga seawater dna. complete protein coding sequences are required for this purpose, thus a genome walking approach  was employed to obtain the complete cdss. of the three complete putative phac cdss, only i-gg <dig> with high sequence identity to marinobacter sp. showed 60 wt% of p accumulation in recombinant c. necator phbˉ <dig>  the reason for the inability of recombinant c. necator phbˉ <dig> harboring either i-gg <dig> or i-gg <dig> to produce pha is unknown. the expression of the phac gene alone may not form an active protein in the surrogate host and it may require some other factors to form an active enzyme  <cit> . among the three genome walking dna fragments, only i-gg <dig> had the phac clustered with other pha metabolism related genes, i.e., phasin , a pha granule-associated protein. it is not unusual because it is known that in some bacteria the phac is not present in the same operon with phaa and phab  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first phac gene from the genus of marinobacter that shows functional activity in a heterologous expression host. bacteria from this genus have been discovered in various habitats and at all depths in the oceans  <cit> . some species of bacteria from the genus marinobacter have been shown to display the ability to degrade hydrocarbons  <cit>  and pha polymers  <cit> . very recently, this genus was suspected to be one of the pha producers  <cit> , but so far no studies have been published confirming pha production from pure cultures of marinobacter sp. in this study, we used a nitrogen-limiting medium, mineral salts medium  instead of rich nutrient medium such as lb and nr to promote the accumulation of pha in the recombinant c. necator phb¯ <dig>  this strain required nutrient-limiting conditions such as nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, sulphur or oxygen but at the same time with the supply of excess carbon source to initiate pha biosynthesis  <cit> .

new source of phac from culture-independent studies
in this study, we have compiled the phac sequences obtained from culture-independent studies  <cit>  and compared their relationship with phacs from known pha producers based on the phylogenetic tree. bacterial genera with known pha producers have been summarized by verlinden et al.  <cit>  and koller et al.  <cit> . interestingly, almost half of the phac sequences from culture-independent resources have not been examined for pha productivity. a noticeable difference is the prevalence of class i phacs of alphaproteobacteria in seawater dna with a higher proportion of uncharacterized phacs compared with other environmental dna  where the class i phacs of betaproteobacteria is the dominant group. this could be explained by the fact that alphaproteobacteria is one of the most dominant bacterial groups found in pelagic seawater realms  <cit> .

we can foresee that the number of uncharacterized phacs will increase in the near future due to the popularity of culture-independent approaches and bacterial whole genome sequencing. however, cautious interpretation is needed due to the existence of gene paralogs  <cit>  where some bacteria harbor more than one copy of the phac gene in their genome, such as in c. necator, bradyrhizobium japonicum, r. rubrum  <cit> . in some cases, these paralogs show low sequence similarity or even belong to different phac classes  <cit> . therefore, further evaluation of phac activity through either in vitro or in vivo approaches will be required, especially for phacs retrieved from culture-independent studies.

CONCLUSIONS
a new functional phac that has high identity to that of marinobacter sp. has been discovered and pha accumulation was observed in recombinant c. necator phbˉ <dig>  further studies are currently ongoing to characterize the full potential of this newly identified pha synthase. seawater and other environmental resources harbor a great diversity of phac genes with unexplored phac activity. functional evaluation of these in silico-based phacs via genome walking has provided new insights into the polymerizing ability of the enzyme from rarely cultured microorganisms.
