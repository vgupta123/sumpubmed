BACKGROUND
bacteriophages  are the most abundant life forms on the planet, and can influence the entire bacterial ecosystem  <cit> . they are capable of delivering, through horizontal gene transfer, mechanisms of adaptation and resistance, toxins and photosynthesis genes to their hosts. they also contribute to the cycling of organic and inorganic nutrients  <cit> . according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses, double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid  tailed phages constitute one order , three families  and  <dig> genera   <cit> .

mycobacteriophages infect members of the genus mycobacterium and were first isolated in the 40’s and 50’s  <cit> . they were initially used as tools in the study of bacterial genetics and for diagnosis and typing of mycobacterium tuberculosis . more than  <dig> mycobacteriophage genomes have been sequenced  a collection that has grown rapidly due in part to the impact of integrated research-education programs  <cit> .

all mycobacteriophages isolated to date are dsdna tailed phages and morphologically are siphoviridae or myoviridae  <cit> . mycobacteriophages have been isolated from clinical samples of diseased and healthy people  <cit> , animals  <cit> , laboratory cultures  <cit> , but primarily from the environment, especially from soil to compost samples . most known mycobacteriophages were isolated using mycobacterium smegmatis mc <dig> as a host, comprising the largest collection of sequenced viruses infecting a common host  <cit> . however, there is a geographical disequilibrium in mycobacteriophage isolation, and only about 7 % were isolated outside united states of america  . the analysis of sequenced genomes shows exchange of genome segments among the phage population, revealing mosaicism as the main characteristic of such genomes  <cit> . nonetheless, genome comparison allowed the grouping of phages showing significant genomic similarities in clusters and subclusters  <cit> .

composting is a controlled process of plant and other living material decomposition by autochthone organisms that results in the production of compost to be used as fertilizer. macro and microorganisms, as common bacteria, fungi, protozoan, algae, larvae and arthropods can participate in the degradation of organic matter. however, composting processes are typically carried out mainly by complex microbial communities  <cit> . such intense microbial activity promotes orchestrated changes in temperature and potential of hydrogen   <cit> . the high diversity of organisms present at different times during the composting process offers an important source of environmental microorganisms and phages for study.

the são paulo zoo park foundation  has an area of  <dig>  square meters  and maintains an exhibition fauna of more than  <dig>  animals, as well as the free-living fauna living in the neighboring atlantic rain forest. the park has operated since  <dig> as an environmental management program, including an effluent treatment plant, a water treatment plant and an organic compost production unit, which receives four tons/day of organic residues from zoo activities and solid waste products from the effluent and water treatment stations. the humus-rich compost generated in the unit is used for the production of food for the zoo animals in the são paulo zoo farm and for fertilization of the park. the sao paulo zoo composting process has been shown to hold a remarkable bacterial diversity, which can fully account for the biomass degradation  <cit> . the composting operation was started in  <dig> and processes  <dig> ton/month of organic waste for compost production. its implementation allowed the recovery and preservation of environmental conditions of the park, reduction of fertilization products costs and better control of the food offered to the zoo animals. indirectly, the park obtains financial benefits.

the objectives of this work were to evaluate if compost from são paulo zoo park is a suitable source for isolation of mycobacteria and mycobacteriophages, to understand the dynamics of mycobacterial and phage isolation during the compost processing and to compare isolated phages with mycobacteriophages from other countries. we report the genome sequences of eight newly isolated phages providing insights into viral diversity and the first evidence for mycobacteriophage evolution within a geographically isolated niche.

RESULTS
isolation and identification of mycobacteria from composting material
several colonies of acid-fast bacteria were isolated from the são paulo zoo park composting chambers  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at each time point , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> per plate . this finding is consistent with results obtained in a previous study of metagenomics with two composting chambers from the fpzsp, not related to the ones studied here. the study revealed that domain bacteria predominated during the whole process, comprising approximately 90 % of the analyzed sequences and the order actinomycetales, which includes the family mycobacteriaceae, was included among the  <dig> most abundant orders  <cit> . moreover, kitamura et al. showed that food waste composts contained relatively high amounts of actinobacteria  <cit>  and partanen et al. confirmed that phyllum actinobacteria was predominantly isolated in the thermophilic phase of the composting process  <cit> .table  <dig> cell composition, temperature  and ph of composting chambers

identification of  <dig> randomly selected isolates from the first two collections by polymerase chain reaction  restriction enzyme analysis  of the heat shock protein  <dig> gene  showed that most isolates belonged to the mycobacterium fortuitum group with the following pra-hsp <dig> patterns: m. fortuitum 1: bste ii   and hae iii  , m. fortuitum 2: bste ii   and hae iii  , mycobacterium peregrinum  <dig> bste ii   and hae iii  , m. peregrinum 3: bstei i   and hae iii   and mycobacterium septicum 1: bste ii   and hae iii  . albeit very similar, these pra-hsp <dig> patterns could be clearly distinguished by electrophoresis in 3 % agarose gels . other detected pra-hsp <dig> patterns were mycobacterium kumamotonense 1: bste ii   hae iii  ; mycobacterium terrae 1: bste ii   hae iii   and a novel profile: bste ii   hae iii  .fig.  <dig> pra-hsp <dig> patterns of isolates recovered from composting materials. bste ii and hae iii restriction patterns of the 441 bp amplicon of the hsp <dig> gene are shown in the upper and lower figure, respectively. the figure was produced from different gels with the bionumerics program v.  <dig>  . m: 50 kb ladder . 1: m. peregrinum type 3; 2: m. fortuitum type 2; 3: m. fortuitum type 1; 4: m. septicum type 1; 5: m. peregrinum type 1; 6: m. terrae type 1; 7: m. insubricum type 1; 8: m. kumamotonense type 1



one or two isolates showing each pra-hsp <dig> pattern were submitted to sequencing of the gene that encodes the beta subunit of bacterial ribonucleic acid polymerase  and of the hsp <dig> gene . the sequences from isolates showing the pra-hsp <dig> patterns of m. fortuitum  <dig>  m. fortuitum  <dig>  m. peregrinum  <dig>  m. peregrinum  <dig> and m. septicum  <dig> showed highest similarity with sequences from species that belong to the m. fortuitum group. this group is composed of m. fortuitum, m. peregrinum, mycobacterium senegalense, mycobacterium conceptionense, mycobacterium alvei, mycobacterium mucogenicum, mycobacterium setense and the 3rd biovariant sorbitol positive  and sorbitol negative  . the separation of these species is problematic because they share most phenotypic characteristics, the similarity of deoxyribonucleic acid  sequences is high and the pra-hsp <dig> patterns are very similar, some of them being shared by more than one species: the patterns m. peregrinum  <dig>  m. porcinum  <dig> and m. septicum  <dig> are identical, as well as the patterns of m. senegalense  <dig>  m. conceptionenese  <dig>  m. houstonense  <dig> and m. neworleansense  <dig>  a precise definitive identification was only reached for m. fortuitum and m. septicum, which showed concordant identification results by pra-hsp <dig>  rpob and hsp <dig> sequencing. nevertheless, considering these isolates in conjunct, the m. fortuitum group was the most prevalent in compost in this study, corresponding to  <dig>  %  of the obtained isolates.table  <dig> results of identification by pra-hsp <dig>  and by rpob and hsp <dig> sequencing of  <dig> mycobacterial isolates recovered from composting chambers

the isolate showing the pra-hsp <dig> pattern of m. terrae  <dig> was identified as mycobacterium senuense by rpob sequencing and as mycobacterium algericum by hsp <dig> sequencing. these species, and m. kumamotonense, whose identification was confirmed by rpob and hsp <dig> sequencing, belong to the m. terrae complex  <cit> , which was the second group most prevalent in compost samples, corresponding to 21 %  of all isolates.

the isolate showing a novel pra-hsp <dig> pattern not present in the prasite database was identified as mycobacterium insubricum by rpob and hsp <dig> sequencing. this recently described species was isolated from sputum samples but was not considered clinically significant  <cit>  and from fish  <cit> . this is the first description of its isolation from environmental samples and pra-hsp <dig> pattern.

isolation and purification of mycobacteriophages
mycobacteriophages were isolated from chambers  <dig> and  <dig> using m. smegmatis mc <dig> as host. crude extracts from the first collection  yielded  <dig> lytic plaques with material from chamber  <dig> and  <dig> with material from chamber  <dig>  in the second collection  the number of lytic plaques was reduced to  <dig> in chamber  <dig> and  <dig> in chamber  <dig>  additional crude extracts collected at intervals of 15 days, were used for phage isolation, but after the fourth collection no lytic plaques were detected, showing that mycobacteriophages able to infect m. smegmatis were more prevalent in the initial phases of the process. the same experiment was repeated using two fresh samples from a different chamber, collected at 15-day intervals in the initial phase of the composting process, and  <dig> and  <dig> lytic plaques were obtained, respectively. eight mycobacteriophages randomly selected were purified and stored.

we concluded that compost is a good source of mycobacteriophages capable of infecting m. smegmatis mc <dig>  to investigate if mycobacterial isolates from compost could also be used as hosts for isolation of mycobacteriophages from compost we used eight isolates representing the different observed pra-hsp <dig> patterns  as hosts. each isolate was infected with the stored material from chambers  <dig> and  <dig> and fresh material from two additional chambers. no lytic plaques were obtained in these experiments. control infections using m. smegmatis mc <dig> as host in the same experiments were successful in generating lytic plaques . moreover, the eight purified phages previously isolated from chambers  <dig> and  <dig> were not able to infect the mycobacterial isolates from compost. the inability of phages to infect co-existing strains has been also witnessed in other environments, such as seawater cyanophages  <cit> .

mycobacteria isolated in this work may not include the natural hosts of mycobacteriophages from compost. less than 1 % of environmental prokaryotes can grow in controlled conditions  <cit>  and some mycobacteria can be difficult to recover from the environment. moreover, few known phages infect the mycobacterial species identified in this work. phage f-phi wj- <dig> is the only described mycobacteriophage isolated from m. fortuitum  <cit> . additionally, the protocol used for phage isolation, obtained at http://phagesdb.org/workflow/ included an initial step of filtration of the composting material in  <dig>  micrometer  membranes in order to eliminate bacteria and other organisms. this implies that the isolated phages were present as free particles in the material. occasional phages inside mycobacteria, either free or integrated in the genome, were most probably eliminated in the filtration step. interestingly, the metagenomic analysis of two composting cells from the fpzsp, distinct from the ones analyzed here, revealed a low amount of viral sequences, corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the obtained sequences in each chamber  <cit> .

genome sequencing
two sequencing runs yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads respectively, with  <dig> nucleaotides  mean length, totaling  <dig>  mega base-pairs  and  <dig>  mbp, respectively. the reads were assembled generating contigs between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp. the number of reads in each contig ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . final assembly revealed that genome sizes varied from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. three phages were shown to have circularly permuted genomes and five had defined termini with 3’ single strand extensions of  <dig> bases in length .table  <dig> characteristics of the sequenced phages. distribution in clusters and subclusters according to the mycobacteriophage database  and gene and trna prediction performed using the dnamaster program at http://phagesdb.org/




the eight phages sequenced here were compared to metagenomic reads obtained from a sample that included material from five different days during the composting process of a single chamber at fpzsp . some hits were observed, particularly with phage florinda, in sequences of 583 bp, 460 bp and 352 bp, all with at least 99 % identity. the evidence presented suggests that mycobacteriophage sequences can be at least partially recovered by metagenomics.

by comparison with sequences available in the mycobacteriophages database at http://phagesdb.org/ and based on the classification in clusters and subclusters proposed by hatfull et al.  <cit> , two phages  were grouped in subcluster a <dig>  two phages  in cluster b, one  from subcluster b <dig> and the other  in b <dig> and three  were grouped in subcluster f <dig>  one phage  has high dna sequence similarity with singleton phage patience  <cit> , and these two phages were grouped to form the new cluster u. functional assignments from database matches, hhpred results, and syntenic placement can be made for  <dig>  % of the genes in these genomes. across the eight genomes, ten new orphams have been identified, four in subcluster a <dig> phages barriga and nhonho, and six in subcluster f <dig> phages, florinda, giraffes, and quico. the genomic features of each of these groups will be discussed in further detail.

subcluster a <dig> mycobacteriophages nhonho and barriga
phages nhonho and barriga belong to subcluster a <dig> and share extensive nucleotide sequence similarity across most of their genomes to other a <dig> phages, including phages from geographically dispersed locations  . cluster a is the largest of all mycobacteriophage clusters, and includes more than  <dig> members, almost 40 % of the sequenced mycobacteriophage population. phages bxb <dig> and l <dig> – members of subcluster a <dig> and a <dig> respectively – were among the first mycobacteriophages to be fully sequenced  <cit> , and nhonho and barriga share many genomic features with them . the structure and assembly genes coding for terminase, portal, protease, scaffolding, capsid, major tail subunit, tail assembly chaperones, tape measure and minor tail proteins have the canonical syntenic organization, and the lysis cassette is located between the structural genes and the genome left end. the integration cassette that includes a serine-integrase is positioned near the center of the genome and separates the rightwards-transcribed structural genes of the left arm from the leftwards-transcribed genes in the right arm. the repressor genes  are closely related to the bxb <dig> gp <dig> repressor  and presumably are homoimmune to bxb <dig>  <cit>  and the other subcluster a <dig> phages.fig.  <dig> genome comparisons of subcluster a <dig> phages barriga and nhonho. each genome map is shown with the coordinates in kbp flanked by genes represented as boxes positioned above  or below ; the phams to which each gene belongs are indicated above or below genes  with the number of pham members in parentheses. pairwise nucleotide sequence similarity between genomes is shown as spectrum-colored shading between the genomes as determined with blastn; greatest similarity is shown in purple and weakest similarity  shown in red. barriga and nhonho have similar gene contents and genome architectures but with a notable insertion/deletion between the recb and immunity repressor genes. the nucleotide similarity between the two phages is quite high in the capsid genes in the left arm, disappears almost entirely downstream of the major capsid protein, and reemerges in the minor tail proteins



although nhonho and barriga have similar genomic architectures, there are several informative differences between them . for example, in the barriga right arm there are eight open reading frames of unknown function  that are absent from nhonho, but present in a small subset of other subcluster a <dig> phages. we also note that barriga  <dig> is replaced by gene  <dig> in nhonho, an orphan with no close relatives in the mycobacteriophage database. finally, we note that barriga gp <dig>  which is a homologue of the bxb <dig> recombination directionality factor  gp <dig>  <cit>  lacks an intein that is present in the homologue  in nhonho.

comparison of the gene contents of barriga and nhonho with those of other cluster a phages illustrates that these two phages are more closely related to other subcluster a <dig> genomes than those in other subclusters within cluster a . the subcluster a <dig> phages are numerous and diverse, but barriga and nhonho are nonetheless quite closely related to each other, suggesting the possibility that they have evolved together relatively recently within the geographical region from which they were isolated.fig.  <dig> gene content-based network relationships among subcluster a mycobacteriophages. splitstree  <cit>  was used to present the relationships between cluster a mycobacteriophages, using the phamerator database ‘actinobacteriophage_554’, filtering for taxa within cluster a. colored circles indicate the different subclusters, and the phages isolated from the sao paulo zoo are boxed



mycobacteriophages pops and godines from cluster b
phages pops and godines belong to subclusters b <dig> and b <dig>  respectively, with close similarity to phages isolated elsewhere, notably within the usa   <cit> . pops is most closely related to the subcluster b <dig> phages numberten and suffolk, but differs from both in several genomic features . several of these differences suggest genes that are unlikely to be essential for lytic growth as they are present in some but not all of these genomes: first, pops and numberten share a gene  of unknown function that is absent in suffolk; second, pops lacks a small gene  present in both suffolk and numberten , third, pops  <dig> and suffolk  <dig> are nearly identical, but the corresponding gene in numberten  has a central deletion removing about 50 % of the gene . finally, pops gene  <dig> is closely related to numberten gene  <dig>  but is deleted in suffolk.fig.  <dig> genome comparisons of cluster b phages numberten, pops, godines and ares. phages numberten and pops are highly similar in both nucleotide sequence and gene content across entire genome spans, as are godines and ares; see fig.  <dig> for figure annotation details. all four cluster b phages have similar gene contents and genome architectures, with insertion/deletions reflected in interruptions in the purple shaded regions between genome pairs



the subcluster b <dig> phage godines is most closely related to phages ares and arbiter . godines shares the common subcluster b <dig> features such as the lack of lysin b gene . another characteristic of this group is the presence of six genes between the gene for terminase and the left genome end , whose products are predicted to be involved in the synthesis of queuosine from guanosine-5’-triphosphate .

informative differences between godines and other b <dig> genomes include the insertion of a small gene  of unknown function between the putative primase/helicase and dna polymerase genes, which is has only one other relative present in the mycobacteriophages, in the subcluster b <dig> phage baee . also, a gene present in both ares and arbiter  is absent from godines, and a godines gene  is present in ares  but is absent from arbiter; presumably these genes are not required for lytic growth.

pops and godines share only low dna sequence similarly to each other and share fewer than 25 % of their genes through amino acid sequence comparisons. they are each more closely related to other phages than to each and thus there is no evidence to suggest they have evolved in evolutionary isolation in the geographic area from where they were isolated.

cluster f mycobacteriophages florinda, girafales and quico
three phages, florinda, girafales, and quico are related to cluster f phages, and all belong in subcluster f <dig> . nucleotide similarity searches using nucleotide basic local alignment search tool  suggest that the three phages are somewhat more similar to each other than to other subcluster f <dig> phages, and this is reflected in a phylogenetic representation based on gene content . this presents compelling evidence that these three phages have evolved with some degree of isolation from the other subcluster f <dig> phages, most of which were isolated within the united states, as suggested for nhonho and barriga above. interestingly, there is no close general correlation between geological location and genome type for the mycobacteriophage phage collection as a whole, and the relatedness between florinda, girafales and quico may indicate localization within the specific zoo location from which they were isolated. comparison of the genome maps  shows that the gene content relationships are likely dominated by a series of  <dig> small open reading frames  located immediately to the left of the integrase gene. these small open reading frames  are nearly identical in florinda, girfales and quico but not found in any other mycobacteriophage genome .fig.  <dig> genome comparisons of cluster f mycobacteriophages florinda, girafales, quico, danaerys, and boomer. florinda has close similarity with danaerys capsid and packaging genes near the left end; girafales and quico have greatest similarity in this region to boomer. all three newly sequenced phages have a region containing  <dig> genes in common adjacent to the integrase that are either not present or rare in other cluster f phages

fig.  <dig> gene content-based network relationships among subcluster f <dig> mycobacteriophages. splitstree  <cit>  was used to present the relationships between subcluster f <dig> phages, using the phamerator database ‘actinobacteriophage_554’, filtering for taxa within subcluster f <dig>  phages isolated from the sao paulo zoo are highlighted in yellow



other notable features of these phages include the 7– <dig> genes – including the terminase, portal, and capsid subunit genes – at the extreme left end of the genomes . the cluster f genomes have two distinct types of these genes that have unrelated dna sequences but encode similar functions: florinda has one distinct type , whereas girafales and quico have the alternative type . secondly, there is a small group of genes in girafales  that substitute for unrelated genes in florinda and quico . we also note that a small gene  present at the right end of the florinda genome is absent from both quico and girafales, although found in otherwise unrelated genomes in subclusters a <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  its function is unknown .

mycobacteriophage madruga and the novel cluster u
phage madruga is very closely related to the singleton mycobacteriophage patience, with similarity spanning >95 % of their genome lengths   <cit> , and as such, these two phages constitute a newly assigned cluster u . patience has an unusually low percent of guanine and cytosine  content  and its proteome has been defined by mass spectrometry; it was isolated in  <dig> in durban, south africa  <cit> . madruga therefore offers new perspectives from the comparative genomic analysis.fig.  <dig> genome comparisons of cluster u phages madruga and patience. phages madruga and patience share extensive nucleotide sequence similarity with three notable insertion/deletions, and constitute the new cluster u; see fig.  <dig> for figure annotation details



first, madruga shares the low gc% content  to that of patience, and the genomes are of similar lengths . the length difference is primarily accounted for by three genes that are present in patience but absent from madruga: patience genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . patience  <dig> is a putative histidine-asparagine-histidine motif  endonuclease and there are distantly related copies in cluster c phages myrna and dandelion ; the protein is expressed both early and late in lytic growth  <cit> . patience  <dig> is related to the holliday junction resolvase endonuclease vii which is expressed late in lytic growth  <cit>  and although this function is likely required for dna packaging, we note that patience and madruga both encode another holliday junction resolvase  elsewhere in the genome that is expressed late in lytic growth and could provide functional redundancy . finally, patience gene  <dig> is absent from madruga and was shown to be expressed late in patience lytic growth but is presumably not required; its function is unknown.

finally, we note that putative tails proteins in both madruga and patience  contain a c-terminal 150-residue domain that is also present at the c-termini of putative tail proteins encoded by other phages, including pops , and phages in subcluster d <dig>  d <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and cluster r . hhpred analysis strongly indicates that this domain has a carbohydrate binding function, perhaps with endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase activity. presumably this is associated with host surface recognition or capsule degradation to facilitate the early stages of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work provides new insights into the genetic diversity of mycobacteriophages, and presents supporting evidence for local evolution of groups of phages  in relative isolation from other mycobacteriophages. although the database of sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes is quite large, this is the first clear evidence for this phenomenon, and may reflect in part the richness and growth of the microbial communities within the zoo composting systems from which they were isolated. interestingly, none of the phages isolated here appear to infect any of the mycobacterial strains isolated from the same locations, and thus the natural host for these phages is unclear. we predict that composting systems such as those used to obtain these mycobacteriophages will be a rich source for the isolation of additional phages that will expand our view of bacteriophage diversity and evolution.
