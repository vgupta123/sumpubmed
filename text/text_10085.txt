BACKGROUND
a. baumannii, an important nosocomial pathogen, is becoming an increasing threat to hospital patients due to its ability to develop multidrug resistance  . drug resistance in a. baumannii is due to a combination of mechanisms, including the expression of β-lactamases, alteration of cell membrane impermeability, and increased expression of efflux pumps  <cit> . the drug resistance genes of a. baumannii isolates are often clustered into antibiotic resistance islands  that interrupt the atpase gene   <cit> . for example, a 86-kb resistance island  was found in a. baumannii strain aye   <cit> , and a shorter ri was identified in the a. baumannii strain acicu   <cit> . ris are thought to emerge from the integration of plasmids or other mobile elements, and some drug-susceptible strains lack these ris  <cit> . in addition, plasmid-borne resistance genes have also been reported, e.g., the blaoxa- <dig> gene, which is associated with carbapenem resistance, has been identified in clinical a. baumannii isolates around the world  <cit> .

compared with current knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance mechanisms in a. baumannii, less is known regarding the virulence factors in this bacterium  <cit> . several studies have focused on characterizing the formation of biofilms, one of the determinants involved in the pathogenesis in a. baumannii. for example, a chaperone-usher pili assembly system  has been shown to be involved in attachment and biofilm formation in a. baumannii
 <cit> . other virulence factors identified include a siderophore-mediated iron acquisition system, abai autoinducer synthase, the bfmrs two-component regulatory system, the type vi secretion system   <cit>  and lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . the lps found in a. baumannii, which is composed of lipids, o-antigen, and an outer core  and inner core, has been shown to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of infection  <cit> . the oc gene locus contains many genes encoding glycosyltransferase enzymes that catalyze the bonds between sugars in the oc structure  <cit> .

whole-genome sequencing studies comparing distinct drug-susceptible and mdr strains  <cit>  or isolates from a single patient  <cit>  have improved our understanding of the evolution of a. baumannii. to better understand the genomic variation and the antibiotic resistance mechanisms in a. baumannii, here we sequenced eight clinical a. baumannii isolates with various sequence types and drug susceptibility profiles and performed comparative genomic analysis.

RESULTS
susceptibility profiles, multilocus sequence typing  and whole-genome sequencing
the susceptibility profiles for all sequenced strains are shown in table  <dig>  all  <dig> mdr strains were resistant to the antibiotics gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , ceftriaxone , ceftazidime , cefepime , and tetracycline  but susceptible to polymyxin b . the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig> was sensitive or intermediate to all tested antibiotics except ctr.table  <dig>

we found that all  <dig> mdr strains correspond to global clone ii . the strains bj <dig>  bj <dig>  and bj <dig> share the same sequence type , namely, st <dig>  and strains bj <dig> and bj <dig> share a type . in addition, strains bj <dig> and bj <dig> belong to st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively. however, the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig> shows a novel sequence type.

the basic whole-genome sequencing statistics are shown in table  <dig>  illumina 100 bp paired-end sequencing produced more than 900 mb of data for each of the eight strains, and the sequencing depth ranged from 239× to 473×. the gc content of the genomes was approximately  <dig> %, as expected for the species. the size of the genomes varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb.table  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of a. baumanniiisolates
a maximum-likelihood tree of the  <dig> sequenced genomes and  <dig> reported a. baumannii complete genomes were created based on core snps from whole-genome alignment . the phylogenetic tree showed that the previously sequenced strains and all of the  <dig> mdr clinical isolates belonging to gc ii formed a clade, while strains ab307- <dig>  aye, and ab <dig>  which belong to gc i, grouped together. the bj <dig> and bj <dig> strains are closely related, while strains bj <dig>  bj <dig>  and bj <dig> form another closely related group. interestingly, strain bj <dig>  the drug-sensitive strain, is distinct from all of the sequenced mdr strains, which may indicate that it has a unique origin compared with other drug-resistant strains.figure  <dig>

a. baumanniicore and unique genes
we compared the gene contents of the  <dig> genomes with other a. baumannii reference genomes using the panoct analysis software  <cit> , which utilizes conserved gene neighborhood  and frameshift detection in a weighted scoring scheme and the blast score ratio to effectively generate non-paralogous gene clusters. we found that the pan-genome continued to expand after the compilation of  <dig> genomes, whereas the number of core genes remained relatively stable with the addition of new strains . the size of the pan-genome was  <dig> genes, and there are  <dig> genes  shared among the  <dig> isolates . the number of unique genes ranges from  <dig> in strain bj <dig> to  <dig> in strain sdf . many of these unique genes are hypothetical, transposon-related and phage-related genes. detailed information regarding orthologous groups and singletons of the strains is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the large number of unique genes in these genomes likely indicates frequent horizontal gene transfer events in a. baumannii. hierarchical clustering of these strains based on gene content yields a dendrogram  that is similar to the core snp-based phylogenetic tree  in which strains from gc i form one group and strains from gc ii form another group.we further analyzed the core and unique genes according to the various classes of the clusters of orthologous groups  . we found that core genes were significantly enriched in genes belonging to class j  and class f . in contrast, unique genes were significantly enriched in class l , class v , and class m .figure  <dig>

orthologous clusters in the
a. baumannii
pan-genome


to compare protein sequence evolution rates between the mdr isolates and the drug-sensitive isolates, we measured the nonsynonymous substitution rate  in  <dig> orthologous genes. we previously showed that this rate is a relatively consistent parameter for defining fast-evolving and slow-evolving protein-coding genes  <cit> . the fast-evolving genes we identified among the mdr isolates include many outer membrane proteins and stress-related proteins; one of these proteins is a phenazine biosynthetic phzf-like protein that serves as an enzyme essential for phenazine synthesis. phenazines are pigments, and many exhibit broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against bacteria, fungi, and parasites and can contribute to the ecological competence of the strains  <cit> . in contrast, the identified slow-evolving genes include many conserved hypothetical proteins and metabolism-related proteins. for example, sbma, which is involved in the prokaryotic internalization of antimicrobial peptides , was identified as a slow-evolving gene  <cit> .

snps among a. baumanniistrains
the number of snps among the  <dig> mdr strains with distinct sts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the strains with the same sts showed fewer snps, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  among the  <dig> putative snps identified between bj <dig> and bj <dig>  only  <dig>  were nonsynonymous mutations; these snps were located within genes coding for outer membrane receptor for monomeric catechols, dihydropteroate synthase, fatty acid desaturase, and a putative rnd superfamily exporter. we also found similar nonsynonymous mutations within all of the genes mentioned above between bj <dig> and bj <dig> 

to identify snp regions clustered among the  <dig> mdr strains, snp density was estimated throughout the genomes using a sliding window of 5 kb. the resulting snp density map shows a non-random distribution, with many regions having elevated snp density . one large region of elevated snp density is around the origin of replication of the genome and the k locus, as reported by snitkin et al.  <cit> . we also found other snp clusters containing genes involved in heme utilization, arginine and proline metabolism, the abc-type transport system, etc.

virulence genes identified in the virulence factors database 
putative virulence genes were identified by aligning orf protein sequences to the virulence factors in the vfdb . the homologs of clpp , alda , xcpr , urea , tvib , pilg , pilh , htpb , sodb  and manb  were present in all of the a. baumannii strains. the homologs of pilc, pilt, and pilu were absent in sdf but present in the other strains. in addition, the homologs of bplb , vc <dig> , sf <dig>  and katb  were exclusively present in atcc  <dig>  bj <dig>  aye and d <dig>  respectively.

large genomic variants among a. baumanniistrains
we compared the genomes of our  <dig> a. baumannii strains with the reference genome of a. baumannii mdr-tj, a multidrug resistance strain belonging to gc ii group  <cit> . we identified many highly variable regions ; specifically, the following regions on the mdr-tj genome are missing or have low identity with our strains: from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb.figure  <dig>

genomes. proteins from all sequenced  <dig> a. baumannii strains were aligned using mdr-tj as a reference. the tracks from inside to outside indicate the gc screw and gc content, and the circles from inside to outside are the blastp percent identities of orfs from bj <dig> to bj <dig> against mdr-tj. red indicates 90–100% identity, yellow indicates 60–89% identity, and blue indicates 0–59% identity.



the region from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb was predicted to be the prophage locus. the sequence of strain bj <dig> in this locus is highly similar to that of the reference genome, while other strains have variable sequences in this region . interestingly, an isaba1-associated deletion of approximately 20 kb in a region of adhesion genes  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb was absent from the strain bj <dig> and from the previously reported reference strain mdr-zj <dig>  <cit> . the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb encompasses a cluster of genes involved in iron acquisition. the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb was predicted to be the second prophage locus. the approximately 40-bp region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, which encodes the entire type vi secretion system , was completely absent from strain bj <dig>  the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, which encodes the entire abar-like genomic island , was also completely absent from strain bj <dig>  a more detailed analysis of this island is shown in figure  <dig>  the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb contains many highly divergent genes, including several membrane proteins, stress-related proteins, and efflux pumps. specifically, the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb encompasses a series of genes encoding the o-antigen component of lps.figure  <dig>

in addition, the above-mentioned variable regions are always accompanied by several insertion elements, which may assist the integration of resistant and pathogenesis-related genes and facilitate the transfer of drug resistance and pathogenic genes among strains. in addition, is elements may enhance drug-resistance and virulence by promoting gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, the crispr  systems, which were identified in the genomes of three gc i strains , were not present in any of the  <dig> sequenced strains.

abar-like resistance islands 
we compared the sequences of abar-like ris in each a. baumannii isolate and found a series of variation events at this locus . abar-like ris inserted in the comm gene were identified in all  <dig> mdr strains: abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> shared the same structure, abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> shared a structure, and abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> shared a structure. in addition, abarbj <dig>  abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> were novel abar-like ris, while the remaining regions have been previously reported  <cit> . abar-like ris were not found in strain bj <dig>  which may partly explain its susceptibility to antibiotics.

abarbj <dig> shares the same backbone with abarmdr-tj and consists of two tn <dig> transposons and  <dig> resistance-related regions  . rr1a inserted at the 3’-end of the island contains isaba1Δ , sul <dig> , glmm  and tnsa ; rr <dig> located between the two copies of tn <dig> bears the antibiotic resistance gene sul2; rr <dig> at the 5’ end of abarbj <dig> contains four resistance genes: teta and tetr , stra and strb . there was also a cluster of orfs inserted between tn <dig> and rr2; this cluster is designated “orfs” in figure  <dig>  compared with abarbj <dig>  the rr1a region and a part of the 3’end of tn <dig> in abarmdr-tj were absent. abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> had a truncated rr1a  designated as rr1b; the rest of the structure was identical to that of abarbj <dig>  abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> included tn6022Δ <dig> and rr <dig> segments, while abarbj <dig> and abarbj <dig> only contained the tn6022Δ <dig> segment without resistance genes.

comparative analysis of abar-like ris in the  <dig> mdr strains and the other  <dig> gc ii isolates was also performed . one major distinction among the ris in the gc ii strains was the presence or absence of a second tn <dig> copy. tn <dig> or tn6022Δ were mutual segments that existed in all of these strains, while the three resistance regions  and orfs were deleted or truncated in certain strains. in abarbjab <dig>  abartcdc-ab <dig> and abar1656– <dig>  large fragments of inserted segments were found: the vertical arrow in abarbjab <dig> indicates the insertion of tn <dig> and the tra system specific to this island  <cit> ; the arrow in abar1656– <dig> indicates an inserted rr3a segment containing the resistance genes per- <dig> and stra  but not the teta and tetr regions of rr <dig>  <cit> ; and the arrow in abartcdc-ab <dig> indicates a large segment specific to this strain containing six is <dig> elements and multiple resistance genes  <cit> .

interestingly, the comm region of the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig> was interrupted by a novel genome island . this island was  <dig>  kb in length and contained no antibiotic resistance gene . rather, five metal-resistance genes, including cuer, znta, arsr, czcd and xre were identified within this island. furthermore,  <dig> orfs of unknown function were present in gibj <dig>  including a tnsa gene encoding an endonuclease domain protein, an int gene encoding an integrase core domain protein, the transposon-related tnib and tniq genes and an inserted is <dig> segment.figure  <dig> 
structure of genomic islands in the bj <dig> strain. the structure was drawn to scale according to the sequences of the genomic island in the genome and showed that the comm gene was interrupted by a novel genome island . this island was  <dig>  kb in length and did not contain any antibiotic resistance genes.



other mobile elements containing resistance genes
class  <dig> integron is an important factor for the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in a. baumannii, especially the aminoglycoside resistance genes  <cit> . six of our mdr strains contained a class  <dig> integron, and their gene cassette arrays were as follows: the integron of bj <dig> harbored a gene cassette array of aacc1-orfp-orfp-orfq-aada1; the integrons of bj <dig>  bj <dig> and bj <dig> included gene a cassette array of aacc1-orfa-orfb-aada1; and the integrons of bj <dig> and bj <dig> had a gene cassette array of aaca4-catb8-aada <dig>  among these gene cassettes, aacc <dig>  aada <dig> and aaca <dig> are aminoglycoside resistance genes; catb <dig> is group b chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; and orf p, orfq, orfa and orfb encode proteins of unknown function. in addition, all of the found integrase protein sequences were 100% identical.

we also identified a blaoxa-23-containing transposon tn <dig> in all sequenced strains, except for bj <dig> and bj <dig>  this result was consistent with the antimicrobial susceptibility testing. tn <dig> has been previously described in three chinese a. baumannii strains: mdr-zj <dig>  ab <dig> and mdr-tj   <cit> . genomic analysis revealed that tn <dig> was flanked by two directed repeats of isaba <dig> elements at both ends, and the class d β-lactamase gene blaoxa- <dig> existed at the 3’-end and was adjacent to the isaba <dig> element. is elements represent another source of variability among a. baumannii isolates, and the insertion of isaba <dig> might play a significant role in the expression of blaoxa-23
 <cit> .

comparative analysis of antibiotic resistance genes
a comparative analysis of antibiotic resistance genes was performed on the  <dig> sequenced strains and  <dig> reference strains, among which the bj <dig>  d <dig>  ab307- <dig>  atcc <dig> and sdf strains are antibiotic susceptible . there are four types of β-lactamase in all of these strains, including class a β-lactamase, class c β-lactamase, class d β-lactamase and the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily. the four types of β-lactamase are encoded by various types of genes and are responsible for much of the multidrug resistance of these strains. among the  <dig> sequenced strains in this study, the ampc, metallo-β-lactamase superfamily gene, putative class a β-lactamase gene and blaoxa- <dig> existed in all of the  <dig> mdr strains. the tem- <dig> and putative class c β-lactamase gene were shared by six of the seven mdr strains. however, per- <dig> is unique to bj <dig>  and blaoxa- <dig> is unique to bj <dig>  the per- <dig> gene also exists in mdr strain 1656– <dig>  per- <dig> is an extended-spectrum β-lactamase, and its induction might be responsible for resistance to all cephalosporins and cause difficulties in treating infections  <cit> .table  <dig>

resistance to aminoglycosides is primarily mediated by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes , which include three types: aminoglycoside n-acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside o-phosphotransferase, and aminoglycoside o-adenylyltransferase. these three types of ame genes, especially the aaca <dig>  aacc <dig>  stra, strb, apha <dig> and aada <dig> genes, are commonly found in the  <dig> sequenced mdr bj strains and the  <dig> reference mdr strains. in contrast, the sequenced non-mdr strain bj <dig> and the  <dig> reference non-mdr strains contain fewer ames genes: bj <dig>  d <dig>  ab307- <dig> and sdf each contain one apha1gene, and atcc <dig> does not contain an ame gene. mutations in the gyra  and parc  genes are responsible for quinolone resistance in a. baumannii. in this analysis, all of the mdr strains except zw85- <dig> contained a mutation in gyra gene, while the parc gene mutation was only present in nine of the mdr strains. this result might indicate that gyra  plays a more important role than does parc  in fluoroquinolone resistance. among the  <dig> mdr strains, only  <dig> include the group a or group b chloramphenicol acetyltransferase genes. there may be other resistance mechanisms, such as efflux pumps, that contribute to chloramphenicol resistance in these mdr strains. the sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthase genes were present in all of the analyzed mdr strains, while in the  <dig> non-mdr strains, only atcc <dig> contained a sul <dig> gene.

the rnd  family efflux pump, consisting of the adea, adeb and adec genes, was present in most of these strains. this efflux pump requires the coexistence of all three genes  to function properly. the antibiotic-susceptible strains d <dig>  atcc <dig> and sdf do not contain a functional adeabc efflux pump. all of the mdr strains except bjab <dig> contain intact adea, adeb and adec genes, which might play a role in their antibiotic resistance. some efflux pump genes belonging to the mfs  were also identified in several of the mdr strains, including teta, tetb and tetg, which encode tetracycline efflux proteins, and cmla and cmla <dig>  which encode chloramphenicol efflux proteins.

discussion
in this study, we used whole-genome sequencing methods to characterize genomic variations and antibiotic resistance mechanisms in clinical a. baumannii isolates with various sequence types and drug susceptibility profiles. although the isolates are closely related, we identified significant genetic differences and a high degree of genomic plasticity in these strains. pan-genomic analysis of the  <dig> a. baumannii isolates and the other  <dig> complete genomes revealed that a. baumannii genomes were highly heterogeneous with respect to gene content and possessed a series of unique genes; these results are similar to those of previous studies  <cit> . the unique genes are enriched in cog class l , class v , and class m , which suggests that these genes are critical for a. baumannii survival or are closely associated with the ability of the bacteria to adapt to challenging niches.

phylogenetic analysis showed that the drug-susceptible isolate bj <dig> was distinct from the other mdr strains, and its closer relationship with the ab <dig> and aye mdr isolates offers another perspective on the origins and acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. in addition, the close relationship among strains bj <dig>  bj <dig>  and bj <dig> indicated they these strains may come from a common ancestor. the csue deletion in strain bj <dig> suggested that this loss may have occurred after the ancestral strain entered the hospital, followed by the mixing of strains with and without csue.

a comparison of the gene content-based dendrogram with the core snp tree revealed a similar clustering relationship. the slight difference in tree topology is primarily driven by  lateral gene transfer and  is-mediated phage- and plasmid-associated gene gain and loss. the crispr repeat elements, which are involved in a complex mechanism that inhibits invasive phage and plasmid dna, were not present in any of the eight strains, which may partly explain the widespread distribution of phage- and plasmid-related genes and the extensive genomic plasticity among a. baumannii isolates.

many regions associated with is-mediated deletions, including a deletion of the entire t6ss region, have been shown to be involved in interbacterial interactions  <cit> . we found that the t6ss region is conserved in all  <dig> of the analyzed mdr a. baumannii isolates. as antibiotic therapy appears to reduce interbacterial competition, this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the mdr phenotype is conferred by antibiotic resistance genes, indicating that the t6ss regions are less important  <cit> . the surface polysaccharide loci are highly variable among the  <dig> strains, which is consistent with a previous report that these regions are significant sources of variability within a. baumannii strains  <cit> . we also found that the oc locus  was less variable and was highly conserved among the mdr strains, but this region was almost completely missing from the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig>  in addition, virulence gene analysis showed that a total of  <dig> putative virulence genes were present in all a. baumannii genomes, suggesting that these genes may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of a. baumannii infection.

abar-like ris inserted in the comm gene were identified in all  <dig> of the analyzed mdr strains but not in the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig>  this isolate contained a  <dig> -kb new gi with five metal-resistance genes but no antibiotic resistance genes . therefore, we suggested that gis inserted into the comm gene are not always associated with antibiotic resistance, and their function might be related to the adaption of the strain to its survival niche. we also found that the ri is highly variable in composition and is not the only contributor to the mdr phenotype. resistance genes in other mobile elements are found outside the ris, and they are able to contribute to drug resistance in each strain examined. among the seven mdr strains, only strain bj <dig> did not contain the blaoxa-23-containing transposon tn <dig>  suggesting that tn <dig> is an important carrier of the blaoxa- <dig> gene in clinical isolates. furthermore, the detection of tn <dig> in both chromosome and plasmid dna suggested that this transposon can be transferred easily between clinical strains.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that, compared with the  <dig> mdr strains, the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig> shows low-level resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam , ceftriaxone  and ceftazidime . we hypothesize that this type of low-level resistance is likely caused by the four β-lactamase genes carried by this strain . in addition, the apha <dig> gene identified in bj <dig> encodes resistance to kanamycin but not to gentamicin, amikacin or netilmicin  <cit> . this result may explain why this strain is susceptible to gentamicin and amikacin. the class d β-lactamase gene blaoxa- <dig> is unique to strain bj <dig>  while the  <dig> mdr strains contain a blaoxa- <dig> gene at the same genomic location. the intrinsic blaoxa- <dig> gene encodes oxacillinase, which can hydrolyze imipenem and meropenem at a low level  <cit> . it is reported that the presence of is elements such as isaba <dig> in the upstream of blaoxa- <dig> can up-regulate the resistance gene’s expression level  <cit> ; however, few is elements were found in the drug-sensitive strain bj <dig>  and no is elements are present upstream of the intrinsic resistance genes. in contrast, the mdr strains contain a series of is element copies, including isaba <dig>  isaba <dig>  and is26; importantly, isaba <dig> elements were identified upstream of blaoxa- <dig> and other ris in all mdr strains. these results may partly explain the variations in antimicrobial susceptibility between the mdr strains and the sensitive strain.

snps are another important source of genetic variation and may contribute to drug resistance and pathogenesis in a. baumannii
 <cit> . both phylogenic and snp analysis indicated that the drug-sensitive isolate bj <dig> is genetically distinct from other mdr a. baumannii strains. in addition, only a small proportion of snps are nonsynonymous among closely related clinical mdr a. baumannii strains with the same sts, indicating that these strains may undergo purifying selection on a genome-wide scale. furthermore, mutation hotspots between mdr strains were identified in several genes associated with drug resistance, e.g., genes encoding dihydropteroate synthase, a target for sulfonamide antibiotics, and the putative rnd superfamily exporter genes, which encode multidrug efflux pumps  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants in a. baumannii isolates. we performed comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> clinical a. baumannii isolates with  <dig> available complete a. baumannii genomes in the ncbi database. our results shed new light on the importance of genomic variations, especially transposon-related and/or phage-related gene variations, in the evolution of a. baumannii. furthermore, we suggest that the mdr a. baumannii strains harbor diverse antibiotic resistance mechanisms. future studies focused on a larger sample of a. baumannii isolates from various hospitals and lineages are necessary to better understand the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in a. baumannii.
