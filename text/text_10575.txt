BACKGROUND
post-translational modification of proteins  is a ubiquitous paradigm for dynamic cellular response and information transfer across all kingdoms of life  <cit> . although historically ptm has been studied in the context of discrete and tightly-regulated signal transduction systems such as eukaryotic histone proteins  <cit> , kinase cascades  <cit> , and prokaryotic two-component systems  <cit> , it is only relatively recently, with the development of tandem-mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, that the abundance and complexity of ptm has become apparent  <cit> . a surprising result from many of these investigations has been that the phylogenetic distribution of many ptms is much wider than had been assumed. a number of ptm types previously thought to be restricted to eukaryotic and metazoan species, such as lysine acetylation  <cit> , serine/threonine phosphorylation  <cit> , tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> , and ubiquitination-like protein ligation  <cit> , are now known to be relatively common in prokaryotic proteomes as well. this realization, in combination with the recognition that ptm plays a critical role in growth and virulence of important prokaryotic pathogens , has highlighted the need for a better understanding of prokaryotic ptm and particularly the need for deeper, proteome-scale analysis of prokaryotic ptms.

in response to these needs, much progress in recent years has been made in the mapping of important ptms across a wide range of prokaryotes  <cit> . however, the vast majority of these studies are limited by only examining a handful of easily-achieved culture conditions and timepoints, and by only examining a single ptm type in isolation. the former limitation is especially important, as batch cultures grown for short time periods in rich media, as is most common for bacterial proteomics experiments, may be a poor reflection of the high-stress, nutrient-starved conditions in which bacteria spend most of their time in the wild  <cit> . while collecting bacterial samples directly from their natural habitat is generally infeasible for proteomics experiments given the requirements for large cell numbers and pure samples, the starvation conditions commonly encountered in a bacterium’s native habitat are thought to be largely recapitulated in long-term batch culture  <cit> . as an exponentially-growing batch culture exhausts the readily available nutrients in the growth medium, the cells undergo a regulated transition into stasis by activating a stereotypic stress response. this response usually involves a decrease of or complete stop to cell division, steep dropoffs in oxidative metabolism  <cit>  and protein synthesis  <cit> , sequestration of ribosomes  <cit> , activation of oxidative damage response systems  <cit> , and increased protease-mediated protein turnover  <cit> . eventually, even this inactive state becomes unsustainable for the majority of cells in the culture, and a large-scale die-off takes place until the culture reaches an equilibrium where the remaining cells are able to survive on the nutrients liberated from their less fortunate culture-mates. this “deep stationary” phase of batch culture is poorly understood, but is characterized by a gradual loss of culturability , likely related to accumulated cell damage, and a dynamic equilibrium of genetic changes as mutations advantageous for stationary phase growth  are fixed by selection in the population. the low rate of protein synthesis and the potential importance of nonenzymatic protein-damage modifications in stationary phase makes an understanding of ptm chemistry and dynamics during this portion of the growth cycle especially important.

with a few very recent exceptions  <cit> , studies of ptms at different growth phases in e. coli have been restricted to either a single modification or a handful of pre-specified modifications . this limitation is largely due to both the relatively low abundance of the ptms examined, necessitating the enrichment of modified peptides using ptm-specific antibodies  <cit>  or chromatographic separations  <cit> , and data analysis tools that are only useful for examining a small number of pre-specified ptms. while enrichment is necessary for relatively transient modifications such as phosphorylation, particularly where a broad survey of targets rather than ptm dynamics is the experimental goal, it has a critical shortcoming in that it makes quantitative comparisons among ptm types, and perhaps more importantly between modified and unmodified copies of an individual protein, impossible. adding to this problem is the fact that many of the most commonly-used software packages for ms/ms spectrum–peptide sequence matching  are limited by the need to create an in silico database of theoretical spectra using an existing peptide library; while this approach facilitates rapid searching, it makes searches involving more than a few ptm types computationally unwieldy. the spectrum of ptms beyond a handful of well-studied examples is therefore largely unexplored.

in this work we utilize a recently developed computational tool for unrestricted analysis of ptms in ms/ms proteomics data, moda  <cit> , to examine a unique proteomic dataset  <cit>  covering  <dig> timepoints of the e. coli rel <dig> growth curve in minimal glucose media from early exponential growth  to deep stationary phase . moda uses a combination of de novo sequence-tag matching and spectral alignment to make assigning ptm-containing spectra across a wide range of mass shifts computationally tractable, and this allows us to construct an unbiased ptm spectrum across all phases of growth for all modifications from − <dig> da to + <dig> da. the fine temporal resolution of our dataset then allows us to identify novel temporal trends in a number of ptms, including n-terminal n α acetylation, c-terminal glutamylation, and asparagine deamidation. in addition, the lack of bias or enrichment for specific ptms allows us to track behavior of modified and unmodified proteins across the growth cycle, and to identify a potential functional relationship between n-terminal acetylation, protein oxidative damage, and stationary-phase protein degradation.

RESULTS
we took advantage of a previously existing lc-ms/ms proteomics dataset  <cit>  isolated from  <dig> biological replicate cultures of e. coli b rel <dig> sampled across  <dig> timepoints, from early exponential phase  to extended late stationary phase . the raw spectra from this dataset were used for simultaneous spectrum-sequence matching and ptm identification using the hybrid fragment matching/spectral alignment software moda  <cit> . to reduce computation time and limit the occurrence of false positives, we restricted the moda search to single-peptide mass shifts of +/−  <dig> daltons, with one ptm allowed per peptide spectral match . to further limit the occurrence of false positive matches, we used the moda “correct match” probability  <cit>  to calculate the false discovery rate  and construct subsets of the highest-probability psms with  <dig> and 1% fdr . the samples in our analysis were treated with iodoacetamide  to modify cysteines with a  <dig> da carbamidomethyl group; during moda analysis, this was treated as a static modification to cysteine . however, this results in an incorrect mass shift for any cys ptms that prevent carbamidomethylation , so we added  <dig> da to all cys modifications to ensure that mass shifts for these modifications matched those for non-cys residues. note that this also results in a small number of mass shifts falling outside the +/- <dig> da window specified in the initial moda analysis, e.g. the + <dig> da mass shift due to combined dithiothreitol  and carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine  <cit> .

localization of modifications within peptides was performed by moda during the spectral alignment phase  <cit> . to most effectively combine modifications among overlapping peptides, we transformed these moda peptide position calls into protein coordinates and used them to generate vectors of counts for all observed mass shifts at every amino acid position across the proteome. a matching set of unmodified counts was generated for all amino acid positions by counting all observations of an unmodified residue across all peptides overlapping a given amino acid position.

we identified a total of  <dig> , <dig> psms across all  <dig> samples, corresponding to a total of  <dig>  peptides that occur in at least one sample; these peptides represent  <dig> individual proteins when all timepoints are considered . fdr filtering lowers these numbers substantially, yielding  <dig> , <dig> psms and  <dig>  unique peptides across  <dig>  proteins in the fdr <dig> set, and  <dig> , <dig> psms and  <dig>  unique peptides across  <dig> proteins in the fdr <dig> set . these filtered numbers are in agreement with previous proteomic experiments in e. coli  <cit> , with the slightly lower number of proteins in our analysis, likely a result of the reduced sensitivity inherent in the larger search space used by moda.



we chose to focus on the fdr <dig> dataset for all subsequent analysis for two primary reasons. first, this was the more conservative cutoff, and by our analysis did not result in the exclusion of an excessive number of psms. in addition, because psm error rates can differ significantly between modified and unmodified peptides  <cit>  we wanted to select the dataset that minimized the differences in error rates between modified and unmodified psms. we did observe that the distribution of moda probabilities was in general higher for modified compared to unmodified psms, , but this difference was minimal in the fdr <dig> dataset .

a large fraction of the e. coli proteome undergoes ptm during growth and starvation in glucose
of the  <dig> , <dig> psms identified across all timepoints in the fdr <dig> dataset, a remarkably large fraction,  <dig>  , are predicted by moda as having a putative ptm. these modified psms corresponded to  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unique peptides  having at least one modification in any sample, and  <dig>  out of  <dig> proteins  having at least one modification on any constituent peptide. interestingly, the proportion of the proteome predicted to have at least one ptm remains relatively constant across time points and biological replicates. psms, unique peptides, and proteins all show very little change in the proportion of overall ptm across all  <dig> time points .

composition of the e. coli ptm spectrum
a unique feature of our analysis strategy is the ability to conduct an unbiased search for spectra matching post-translationally modified peptides across a wide range of possible mass shifts. we used moda to search our raw spectral data for  <dig> potential peptide mass shifts, ranging from − <dig> da to + <dig> da; counts of psms for this range of mass shifts are shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> mass-shift counts across all timepoints and datasets. shown are the psm counts for all mass shifts identified by moda  <cit>  between − <dig> da and + <dig> da, summed across all nine timepoints and all three biological replicates; labeled peaks are the top  <dig> most abundant  mass shifts in the dataset




the overall abundance of individual mass shifts varies widely, with the most abundant mass shifts corresponding to small functional group modifications. the most abundant mass shift is a neutral gain of  <dig> da . in addition to simple protonation, this mass change can result from a number of more complicated modifications and ms artifacts; see discussion. other abundant mass shifts include oxidations , metal ion adducts such as sodium  and potassium , and neutral losses such as deamidation  and dehydration .

commonly studied regulatory ptms are relatively rare in our data, most likely due to their low abundance in the proteome and the fact that our samples did not undergo enrichment for specific modifications prior to analysis. although a large number of apparent acetylations  were identified, only a handful of these map to known acetylated lysine residues  <cit> . a small number of phosphorylations  were identified, although the majority of these are modifications to an active-site serine that acts as a phosphoryl group donor during catalysis in the metabolic enzyme phosphoglucomutase . we also recovered a number of previously identified lysine methylation modifications for the ribosomal proteins l7/l <dig> , l <dig> , and elongation factor tu , although the last two were only observed in the first and third biological replicates, respectively. a table of counts for all mass shifts recovered by moda is included in additional file  <dig> 



distribution of target amino-acid residues varies widely among mass shifts
the most commonly modified amino acid across all timepoints is methionine—nearly all of these modifications are a + <dig> da shift corresponding to oxidation —followed by the hydrophobic amino acids ala, val, leu, ile; amide-containing amino acids asn and gln; and their carboxyl counterparts asp and glu . the observation of a large number of modifications on amino acids with hydrocarbon side-chains, which are generally not expected to undergo ptm, can likely be explained by a combination of incorrect assignment of a mass shift to the amino acid  by moda, modification of the backbone nh or co groups, or selection of peaks with isotopically shifted masses during ms <dig>  the bulk of modifications to ala, val, leu, and ile are + <dig> da modifications, consistent with most of these modifications being due to selection of 13c-containing peaks . this effect is expected to occur randomly across the proteome, so the higher numbers for these particular amino acids are most likely due to their higher abundance relative to other aas in e. coli proteins  <cit> .



we constructed the distribution of targeted amino acids for each mass shift by counting occurrences of each mass shift–aa pair across all nine time points. we observed significant differences among mass shifts in preference for a single type  of amino acid residues; the + <dig> da and + <dig> da modifications, for example, show a broad distribution across aa types, while + <dig> da and − <dig> da show strong  preference for methionine. to quantify these differences in aa distribution, we ranked mass shifts by the ratio: psms for most common aa / mean. aa distributions for the the top ranked  mass shifts are shown in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> distribution of selected mass shifts across amino acids. the height of bars within each row represents the fraction of total aa positions for the mass shift  that were identified on each amino acid residue type . individual bars within each column represent fractions for each biological replicate . mass shifts are ordered by the single-aa bias score  with the highest score  at the top; only the top  <dig> mass shifts are shown. note that a constant mass shift of + <dig> da was added to all cysteine modifications to correct for the presence of carbamidomethylation, meaning that a small number of cysteine modifications  fall outside of the mass range scanned by moda 




a large number of modifications with a strong preference for cysteine residues were identified in all three biological replicates; most of these are likely artifacts of iaa treatment during sample preparation, and correspond to common modifications co-occuring with carbamidomethylation , e.g. + <dig> da , + <dig> da , and + <dig> da . the + <dig> da mass shift, corresponding to a carbamidomethylated dithiothreitol modification of the cysteine thiol group, is a minor artifact of the reduction and alkylation of cysteine during sample preparation  <cit> . the + <dig> da mass shift was almost exclusively found at catalytic cysteine residues in a handful of proteins, and corresponds to the hyperoxidation of the cysteine thiol group  into cysteic acid . this modification is likely to be inactivating and irreversible, resulting in the increased accumulation of the modified form throughout the stationary phase. among modifications targeting non-cys residues, putative oxidative modifications show the strongest bias towards a single aa, with the + <dig> da and +16/+ <dig> da modifications showing strong preferences for tryptophan and methionine, respectively. the eighth-ranked − <dig> da modification is likely also a result of oxidation via dethiomethylation of methionine residues  <cit> . the strong preference of the acetylation mass shift  for serine is largely due to modifications on protein n-termini . a table of counts for each mass shift-amino acid pair is included in additional file  <dig> 

n-terminal and c-terminal modifications
to search for modifications that preferentially occur at protein n and c termini, we used fisher’s exact test  to compare the ratio of modified : unmodified counts of each mass shift occurring at the n or c terminus of a protein to the same ratio for mass shifts occurring at all other positions. fet p-values for n-terminal and c-terminal enrichment were calculated for all mass shifts within each biological replicate and filtered for consistency by requiring all three replicates to have p< <dig> . nt- and ct-biased mass shifts are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we also examined the distribution of unique modified positions for these nt- and ct-biased mass shifts as a function of normalized protein length, to determine whether the observed positional bias was a general feature of the mass shift or due to a small number of highly abundant modified positions .

eight mass shifts were identified as nt-biased after filtering . the strongest nt preference is displayed by the + <dig> da mass shift, corresponding to n-terminal acetylation, with modified n termini representing 35–42% of total observed counts for positions with at least one + <dig> da count. the remaining nt-biased mass shifts fall into two broad categories. the first are rare modifications that occur at a small number of positions at high frequency, such as the + <dig> da mass shift , the + <dig> da mass shift  and the + <dig> da mass shift . the second category is comprised of common modifications that occur at low frequency across a larger number of positions; this includes oxidation , most commonly of a retained nt methionine, and protonation . a beneficial feature of our analysis is the ability of moda to identify modified n-terminal residues even in the presence of un-annotated n-terminal methionine cleavages. for the protein secb, for example, we recovered abundant n-terminal peptides which had both undergone n-terminal met cleavage and putative acetylation at the penultimate n-terminal ser residue , despite the fact that this protein had not been annotated as having its n-terminal met cleaved in the uniprot database.

only three mass shifts were identified as ct-biased after consistency filtering . two of these, + <dig> da  and + <dig> da , most likely correspond to the same modification, c-terminal addition of a glutamate residue. interestingly, the third c-terminal mass shift is oxidation , which is observed to occur at high frequency  on c-terminal residues as well as n-terminal residues, although the c-terminal modification is observed for a smaller set of proteins.

the c-terminal glutamylation modification is especially interesting. the most frequent target for this modification is the c terminus of the 30s ribosomal protein s <dig> , which is known to undergo post-translational modification with 1– <dig> glutamate residues   <cit> . the enzymatic addition of these glu residues to s <dig> proceeds in a stepwise fashion, and any modification of two or more glu residues would fall outside the range of mass shifts that were considered in our analysis, so it is likely that the mono-glutamylated s <dig> we observed only represents a subset of the total modified s <dig> present in our samples.

we also identified a previously unreported c-terminal + <dig> da modification of the stationary phase ribosomal stability factor raia / yfia  <cit> . yfia binds within the mrna tunnel of the 30s subunit  <cit> , where it inhibits translation  <cit>  and prevents subunit dissociation and 100s dimer formation for a subset of ribosomes in stationary phase  <cit> . yfia and s <dig> lie near one another within the 30s subunit, and both proteins’ c termini extend towards the same region of the 16s rrna on the subunit surface , although the modified c-terminal tails themselves are not resolved in the crystal structure. the temporal modification patterns of s <dig> and yfia differ dramatically . s <dig> levels of both total psm counts and ct +129-da modified counts peak in mid-exponential phase, followed by a steep drop to a lower number of counts that is maintained through late stationary phase; the relative proportion of + <dig> da modified counts remains nearly unchanged across all time points. in contrast, yfia shows low or no counts of either modified or unmodified psms until the onset of stationary phase, when overall counts increase dramatically, accompanied by a low but constant level of c-terminal + <dig> da modification through late stationary phase. the exponential phase enrichment we observed for the + <dig> da mass shift is therefore due largely to changes in overall expression of its target proteins rather than differential modification.

temporal patterns
the glucose starvation dataset used in our analysis is unique in the wide range of timepoints  that were sampled. changes in abundance during different phases of the growth cycle in liquid culture have been observed for individual ptms, but an unbiased examination of temporal variation in the global ptm profile has not been performed in e. coli. to identify mass shifts with significant frequency changes over the growth cycle, we first pooled four of our nine time-point samples into exponential-phase samples  and four into stationary-phase samples .  we then grouped counts across modified amino-acid positions by mass shift–aa pairs and compared the ratio of modified:unmodified counts at all modified positions in the exp and sta pools using fisher’s exact test   <cit> . mass shift–aa pairs were called as significant if their fet p-values passed a false-discovery rate filter  in all three biological replicates. because we used a two-tailed test that was unable to determine the direction of enrichment , we subsequently divided significant mass shift-aa pairs into exp > sta or exp < sta groups using the fet log-odds score.

we identified only a single mass shift that consistently shows significantly higher levels of modification in exponential phase across all three biological replicates, a + <dig> da modification of tryptophan . the behavior of this mass shift differs slightly across the three biological replicates: in biological replicates  <dig> and  <dig>  the + <dig> da trp modification shows a spike in abundance near the exponential-stationary phase transition , followed by a drop to near zero by mid-stationary phase , while replicate  <dig> shows a spike of enrichment earlier in exponential phase  followed by a steep drop off at the 5h timepoint .

we identified five mass shifts that consistently show significantly higher levels of modification in stationary phase across all three biological replicates: a + <dig> da modification of asparagine ; + <dig> da modifications of serine, alanine, and threonine , and a + <dig> da modification of cysteine  . as with the exponential-phase-biased mass shifts, we observed different temporal patterns when timepoints are considered individually . for example, the + <dig> da asparagine modification and the + <dig> da cysteine modification show steady increases across stationary phase, reaching their highest value at the latest stationary phase timepoint , while the + <dig> da modification to serine shows a more step-like increase in abundance near the onset of stationary phase, with abundance remaining fairly constant through the latest timepoints.

preferential persistence of n-terminally acetylated proteins in stationary phase
the n-terminal bias and preference for serine, alanine, and threonine residues observed for the + <dig> da mass shift strongly suggests that this modification corresponds to n-terminal n α-acetylation. although cotranslational n-terminal n α acetylation  is widespread in eukaryotic proteins, the prevalence and physiological significance of this modification in prokaryotes is poorly understood. in e. coli, only five native proteins are known to possess an ntac modification: the ribosomal proteins s <dig> , s <dig> , and l12/ <dig>  <cit> ; elongation factor tu   <cit> ; and the chaperone secb  <cit> . in addition, a number of heterologous eukaryotic proteins are modified with an ntac when overexpressed in e. coli .

we identified  <dig> nt-acetylated proteins  and were able to recover modified peptides from known nt-acetylation target secb  and a small number of peptides matching nt-acetylated ribosomal protein s <dig>  in our initial moda dataset. the low peptide counts for s <dig>  as well as the absence of modified psms for the other known  targets ribosomal proteins s <dig> and l7/ <dig>  as well as eftu, are likely due to the presence of tryptic cleavage sites within a few residues of the n-terminus in all three of these proteins . this means that most copies of the protein present in our samples will produce n-terminal peptides too short to recover during subsequent liquid chromatography and ms/ms steps. consistent with this interpretation, we were able to recover abundant peptides from non-n-terminal regions of all four of these proteins, and the small number of s <dig> n-terminal peptides that were recovered were all the result of missed cleavage events at the n-terminal-most cleavage site. among the ntac peptides that were recovered in our moda dataset, the nt fragment from secb is by far the most frequently observed, representing 15–41% of the total nt-acetylated peptides across the nine time points. in addition, six other proteins from our dataset were previously identified as nt-acetylation targets in an enrichment-based analysis of n-terminal modifications in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  .

we observed that ntac modified proteins are proportionally more heavily modified in stationary phase . this pattern could be explained by  an increase in acetylation activity in stationary phase and/or  a proportionally larger decrease in non-acetylated copies of a protein relative to acetylated copies in stationary phase. to differentiate between these scenarios, we plotted total psm counts and ntac-modified psm counts for pooled ntac-targeted proteins across all nine time points . when all ntac-targeted proteins are considered , the total number of psms stays appoximately constant, while the number of ntac-modified psms increases by nearly twofold in early stationary phase, consistent with scenario . however, ntac-targeted proteins pooled by penultimate amino acid  or individual ntac-targeted proteins  show a mixture of both scenarios. ntac-targeted proteins with a penultimate serine or threonine residue, for example, exhibit a pattern consistent with scenario , similar to the pattern for all targets . proteins with a penultimate alanine, however, show a slight increase in modified peptides at the onset of stationary phase, accompanied by a large drop in unmodified peptides . many of the the most heavily ntac-modified proteins also show this pattern, such as lyss, spea, pdxh, and secb , and ilva and kdgr . this preferential retention of ntac-modified peptides in stationary phase suggests that ntac may play role in protein stability by acting as an anti-degradation signal . a table of all nt-acetylation sites recovered by moda is included in additional file  <dig>

asparagine deamidation is strongly enriched in very late stationary phase
an interesting temporal pattern was also identified for the + <dig> da modification of asparagine residues, which increases in frequency throughout stationary phase and peaks at the last timepoint  . a + <dig> da modification occurring on an asparagine residue is known to be a signature of nonenzymatic asparagine deamidation, in which a backbone nitrogen initiates a nucleophilic attack on the amide carbon of the asparagine side chain  to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate . this intermediate can then resolve by hydrolysis to either convert the original asparagine to an aspartate residue, or rearrange to form an isopeptide linkage through isoaspartate; both of these events result in a + <dig> da mass shift.

we found that + <dig> da modifications were the most frequently observed modification in our dataset. they likely result from a variety of sources, most importantly isotopic mass shifts from 13c-containing peptides. while our dataset certainly contains peptides with + <dig> da modifications resulting from isotopic peak shifts, two observations support our hypothesis that a significant fraction of + <dig> da modifications to asp are due to deamidation. first, + <dig> da modifications from isotopic mass shifts are expected to be more prevalent on peptides with higher m/z values. there is indeed a general correlation between peptides with high m/z values and peptides called by moda as having a + <dig> da mass shift; while the median m/z value for all peptides is  <dig> , that for + <dig> da modified peptides is  <dig>  however, while median m/z values for peptides with + <dig> da modifications to all aas except cysteine vary between  <dig> and  <dig>  the asn + <dig> da peptides stand out as having a lower median of  <dig> , and have an m/z distribution that is significantly different from the overall + <dig> da m/z distribution . this finding is consistent with asn + <dig> da peptides being a mixture of 13c-peak selection artifacts and genuine asn deamidation modifications. in addition, high-psm-count asn + <dig> da modifications, but not + <dig> da modifications to other aa types, are enriched for glycine, serine, and asparagine residues at the amino acid position following the modified asn , a pattern that is consistent with known sequence preferences for asn deamidation  <cit> .

although asparagine deamidation can occur spontaneously as an experimental artifact during preparation of proteomic samples  <cit> , a number of lines of reasoning suggest that at least a subset of the modifications we observe were present in the samples prior to processing. first, we observe a nearly identical pattern of increasing asp + <dig> da modification across all three of our biological replicates . all timepoints were collected from a single set of cultures started on the same day, each biological replicate was grown independently  from the others, and all timepoints from a single replicate were processed for proteomic analysis in parallel. the bulk of nonenzymatic deamidation during proteomic sample prep has been shown to occur during tryptic digest  <cit> , with both longer incubation time and basic ph increasing the occurrence of deamidated peptides. the samples used to generate our data were treated with a short tryptic digest  in the presence of near-neutral buffer , conditions that should limit spontaneous asparagine deamidation. in addition, both ph and incubation time should be identical across all timepoints , and any nonenzymatic deamidation should therefore also be constant across timepoints. the pattern does not appear to be explained simply by increased expression of modified proteins during stationary phase, as the pattern is observed even for individual modifications that have high abundance in both exponential and stationary phases . a table of all putative asparagine deamidation sites recovered by moda is included in additional file  <dig> 

oxidative modifications of methionine and tryptophan are variable across biological replicates
oxidation  modifications, particularly of methionine, are very common in our data, but with the exception of + <dig> da modification of tryptophan residues , oxidations in general are not identified as having a significant bias for either exponential or stationary phase. both met + <dig> da and trp + <dig> da show significant variability among the three biological replicates, with replicates one and two showing a similar pattern of relative modification enrichment over time, while replicate three has a different pattern . in addition, for both modifications replicates one and two show a peak of modified peptide counts centered at or near the  <dig> h time point , with the proportion of modified psms then decreasing to early-exponential-phase levels or below by  <dig> h.

the reason for the discrepancy between the third replicate and the two others is unclear; the third replicate was prepared at a later date than the first two replicates, so it is likely that much of this variability is due to batch effects. this observation in combination with the common occurrence of oxidative modifications as experimental artifacts  <cit>  makes it difficult to draw any biological conclusions from the temporal patterns of oxidative modifications. because all samples within each replicate were prepared in parallel, we would expect any artifactual modifications to covary across samples in a replicate; our observation of within-replicate variance correlated across at least two samples is therefore difficult to explain unless some samples have a higher intrinsic rate of artifactual oxidation, or some amount of genuine biological variation is present.

we observe the discrepancy among replicates only for oxidative modifications and not for other modified peptide counts or overall peptide levels, so one possibility is that a difference in redox conditions in sample processing influenced the number of oxidized peptides that were recovered. differential modification in the third replicate is apparent in the temporal modification patterns of individual target sites , but does not display a consistent pattern across sites. tables of all methionine and tryptophan oxidation sites are included in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
we have leveraged a large proteomics dataset  <cit>  and the fast multi-blind spectral alignment algorithm moda  <cit>  to construct a comprehensive, unbiased map of all protein post-translational modifications between − <dig> and + <dig> da at  <dig> timepoints, spanning early exponential phase  through late stationary / starvation phase . from this map, we have identified post-translational mass shifts with statistically significant differences in modification stoichiometry between n- and c-terminal ends of proteins and between exponential and stationary phases. this analysis has enabled us to identify previously unobserved temporal patterns and novel target proteins for known modifications, and to identify possible novel modifications. finally, by comparing temporal patterns of modified and unmodified psm counts for individual aa positions, we have been able to identify a possible relationship between post-translational modification and protein degradation rate in stationary phase.

although decades of work have been dedicated to studying the biochemical and physiological function of post-translational modifications, much of this work has focused on a handful of modification chemistries such as ser/thr phosphorylation and lys acetylation. technical limitations in instrument sensitivity, sample preparation, and data analysis have meant that even these well-studied ptms are often studied in isolation, and their place in the overall context of the cell, in terms of the overall set of pathways and proteins that utilize them, their interaction with other modifications, and their abundance relative to other modifications, is lost. an intriguing feature of our dataset is the relative scarcity of the most commonly studied regulatory modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation; in the few cases where such modifications are identified, they tend to occur at low frequency, even on very abundant proteins .

the overall shape of the e. coli modification spectrum is very similar to that recently determined for human hek <dig> cells  <cit>  and a large collection of human proteomics data from the pride database  <cit> . both of these studies found high counts of + <dig> da modfications, ammonia loss , dehydration , and mono- and dioxidation ; in contrast with our results, these studies also identified high levels of carbamylation  and phosphorylation . whether these differences are due to genuine variability in proteome-wide modification levels or to differences in experimental procedures is unclear.

we have identified examples of abundant modification for n-terminal acetylation and c-terminal glutamylation. while further work is necessary to establish that the orders-of-magnitude differences in abundance between these modifications and more well-known regulatory modifications reflects their actual abundance in the cell, our findings do suggest that these modifications may play a more important physiological role than previously thought. both of these modifications are known to be installed in a regulated and specific pattern on ribosomal proteins, but their function either in the ribosomal context or on other targets is largely unknown. in eukaryotic cells, n-terminal  acetylation has a variety of functions, including regulating protein stability, er trafficking, protein complex formation, and membrane attachment  <cit> , but there is no evidence for a similar role in prokaryotic cells. nt acetylation of e. coli 30s ribosomal subunits s <dig> and s <dig> is thought to affect 30s ribosomal assembly by governing direct contacts with the rrna  <cit> , but no function for prokaryotic nt acetylation outside of the ribosome has been proposed. while nt acetylation of eukaryotic proteins can either inhibit  <cit>  or enhance  <cit>  degradation rates, our evidence suggests that nt-acetylated proteins in e. coli are subject to lower levels of degradation than their unmodified counterparts. the viability of mutants in the three known e. coli nt-acetyltransferase enzymes, rimi, rimj, and riml  <cit> , should make experimental investigation of this hypothesis a tractable and interesting avenue for future research.

similarly, the physiological role of c-terminal  glutamylation has only recently begun to be uncovered. early investigations identified a ct glutamyltransferase enzyme, rimk, that installs poly-e tails on ribosomal protein s <dig> in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , but the only phenotypic effect observed in e. coli
rimk mutant strains  is increased resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics streptomycin, neomycin, and kanamycin  <cit> . nonetheless, rimk, and presumably s <dig> ct glutamylation, are conserved across a wide range of bacterial species  <cit> , and recent work in pseudomonas found profound changes in proteome composition and compromised colonization and virulence phenotypes in Δ

k strains  <cit> . our novel finding of an additional target of c-terminal glutamylation, the ribosomal hibernation factor yfia, offers an additional experimental handle with which to examine the biological and molecular functions of this modification. the association of both ct-glutamylation target proteins with the ribosome is especially interesting, because some evidence suggests that rimk modifies s <dig> c-termini specifically on intact ribosomes  <cit> , and rimk is known to catalyze poly-l-glutamine formation in the absence of s <dig>  <cit> . the c-terminal amino-acid residues of yfia resemble those of s <dig> only in the presence of two glutamate residues in the last two positions , indicating that targeting may largely be a function of yfia’s structural association with the ribosome rather than due to a specific sequence signal.

the presence of a gradual increase in asparagine deamidation throughout our stationary phase samples is an intriguing observation. asparagine deamidation/isomerization events occur spontaneously at a low frequency at specific protein residues with favorable local structure and sequence context  <cit> , and they are often observed in proteins that undergo a low frequency of turnover such as muscle fiber proteins  <cit>  and lens crystallins  <cit> . this clock-like behavior of asp deamidation is consistent with our observation of a steady accumulation of the asp + <dig> da mark through very late stationary phase , and it suggests that proteins having this modification have been retained with little or no turnover throughout stationary phase. remarkably, many of the most heavily modified target proteins are part of large supra-molecular complexes, including six on ribosomal proteins , n <dig> of eftu, n <dig> of the genomic dna structural protein h-ns  <cit> , and two positions  on sucb, the e <dig> subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex   <cit> . although retention of intact ribosomes through stationary phase is a well-documented phenomenon  <cit> , and h-ns has been shown to be involved in late-stationary-phase survival  <cit> , retention of the ogdhc complexes has not been previously observed.

our work has several limitations. first, although the consistent temporal signal across multiple replicates strongly indicates that the major modifications discussed above are of biological origin, we cannot rule out the possibility that a subset of these modifications are experimental artifacts; the oxidative modifications and asparagine deamidation in particular are known to occur as artifacts of downstream sample processing in ms/ms  <cit> , so further experimental verification will be needed to confirm their biological origin. future studies applying our approach to datasets generated from ptm-installing enzyme mutant strains would be especially informative, as would applying targeted mass spectrometry methods such as parallel reaction monitoring   <cit>  for precise quantitation of modification levels and stoichiometry.

our study is also limited by the need to examine a relatively small window of mass shifts ; many known modifications fall outside of this window, such as glycosylation, longer chain acylations, and lipidations  <cit> . in addition, while the lack of bias for particular modifications offers a number of advantages in our analysis strategy, it also means that our results are more limited by the inherent sensitivity of both shotgun ms/ms and computational identification of ptms. consequently, our data are biased towards highly abundant proteins and mass shifts, a factor that likely explains the scarcity of well-known ptms such as lysine acetylation and phosphorylation in our data. equipment improvements and/or novel experimental procedures  will likely be needed to enable detection of low-abundance or short-lived ptm and other rare effects such as translational mutations  <cit> .

while our primary focus in this work was on discovering novel ptm biology, we anticipate that our findings will be of value to the mass spectrometry community more generally. our results highlight the utility of unbiased, mass-shift-aware search strategies for database mapping of spectra containing unexpected ptms that may otherwise have remained unassigned  <cit> . furthermore, our results demonstrate that the presence of unexpected ptm can strongly influence the accuracy of spectral-counting-based estimates of peptide abundance, particularly when the goal is to determine expression patterns over time. for example, we identified a number of proteins where the temporal pattern of the nt-acetylated peptide differs markedly from the unmodified peptide , and from the combined peptide total. if only the unmodified spectra were assigned for a protein such as yadr , abundance of this peptide would appear to decrease at later timepoints in stationary growth; if both modified and modified peptides are examined, it becomes clear that abundance remains constant across the growth cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the work presented here highlights the holistic perspective and novel biological insights that can be generated by combining unbiased ptm detection and deep temporal sampling of bacterial growth. stationary phase biology and post-translational modification in prokaryotic systems are both still areas of active research with many open questions, and we hope that the analysis paradigm presented here can be applied to additional organisms and growth conditions to gain broader insight into prokaryotic physiology and evolution.
