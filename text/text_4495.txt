BACKGROUND
vision is central to many important biological and behavioral processes such as navigation, mate selection, predator avoidance, and foraging. the sensitivity of visual systems to different regions of the visible light spectrum is achieved through the interaction of light photons with visual pigment molecules housed in the photoreceptor cells of the eye. each visual pigment molecule is composed of a g-protein coupled receptor—an opsin—bound to a photosensitive chromophore, retinal. previous studies have suggested substitutions of amino acids in the seven trans-membrane domains closest to the chromophore—the chromophore binding pocket—have the highest potential for altering the peak spectral sensitivity  of a visual pigment, known as spectral tuning . there are two key aspects to the opsin chromophore binding pocket that determine the spectral sensitivity of retinal isomerization upon light activation. the first is the chemical environment of the protonated schiff base, and the second is the shape of the chromophore, which is determined by the structure of the chromophore binding pocket. amino acid substitutions in this region may alter the geometry and steric space available for binding the chromophore and/or alter the chemical nature and hydrogen bonding in the pocket . thus, the identification of amino acid variation between putative opsin copies is an important step in predicting spectral tuning of photopigments.

insect opsins, which underpin sensitivity to ultraviolet , short , and long  wavelengths  <cit> , form natural phylogenetic groups called opsin classes. the common ancestor of the insects is hypothesized to have been trichromatic and possessed a single opsin of each spectral class   <cit> . duplications of the lws and/or sws opsin classes have been shown in a number of insect orders . however, uvs duplications among insects are much less common and have only been recorded within a few members of lepidoptera , diptera , hemiptera , and coleoptera . these duplications have also been shown to result in greater ability to discriminate ultraviolet signals . conspicuously absent, however, are detailed studies on the most diverse animal order—coleoptera .

coleoptera visual systems—a loss of short-wavelength sensitivity?
opsin sequence data for coleoptera is sparse, having only been generated for three groups to date  ; dytiscidae  <cit> ; lampyridae ). interestingly, these studies only recovered two opsin classes  and failed to recover a sws opsin, suggesting the loss of an entire opsin class. such a loss is rare, having only been reported in four other species of insects .

most physiological studies on coleopteran eyes support the loss of a sws opsin class, only detecting sensitivities in the uv and long wavelengths . a few studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of three to five peak spectral sensitivities in other beetle groups . such diversity in spectral sensitivity suggests that the visual systems of these species have a greater underlying molecular complexity. other spectral tuning mechanisms, such as filtering pigments in fireflies  <cit> , serve to narrow and shift the spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment by small amounts . however, to maintain high photon catch, large  shifts in peak sensitivity would be better served by a dedicated photopigment. thus, the aim of this paper is to explore the potential molecular diversity in beetles that might explain the diverse spectral sensitivities observed. as yet, complementary studies with both physiological and molecular data only exist for fireflies   and diving beetles   <cit> , both of which lack sensitivity to short wavelengths.table  <dig> summary of spectral sensitivities  from previous studies on coleoptera

the jewel beetles  are an ideal candidate for studying potential molecular complexity within beetles. most members of the group are diurnally-active, highly visual, and display impressive patterns of metallic and pigmented coloration  that are a central signal to mate recognition . furthermore, erg data suggest the economically important agrilus planipennis fairmaire  has multiple photoreceptor sensitivities to uv, violet, sw and lw portions of the spectrum  <cit> . females also exhibit additional sensitivity to longer wavelengths .fig.  <dig> jewel beetles  sequenced in this study. a

objectives
the purpose of this work is to investigate the molecular basis of potential short-wavelength sensitivity in members of the beetle family buprestidae. the objectives of this study are to: 1) investigate the presence/absence of the sws opsin class, 2) identify potential duplications within uvs and lws opsin classes, and 3) examine opsin protein/chromophore interactions to identify amino acid substitutions that could confer shifts towards short-wavelength sensitivity.

RESULTS
buprestidae opsin classes and copies
the lack of a sws opsin class in beetles is somewhat unexpected, as the diversity of eye morphologies and visually-mediated behaviors within the group  would suggest sensitivity to the full spectral range of visible light. within the buprestidae, although previous physiology data supports sensitivity of one buprestid  to short wavelengths  <cit> , we did not recover a sws  opsin class in any of the taxa analysed. however, we detected at least four opsin copies in all buprestids —two uvs and two lws opsins, the most detected in any beetle species. in the male eab, a partial third lws opsin copy  was detected.fig.  <dig> opsin gene topology of  <dig> sequences based on the single best ml tree under the bic best-fit protein model lg + f + i + g <dig>  logl = - <dig> . ufbootstrap values based on  <dig>  replicates are given at nodes . tree was rooted to bovine rhodopsin outgroup. jewel beetle taxa are bolded

the opsin topology generated for all taxa  recovered well-supported clades  for insect uvs, sws, and lws opsin classes. the buprestid uvs <dig> +  <dig> clade was recovered as sister to the remaining coleoptera uvs in both the full taxon topology  and coleoptera-specific uvs topology . in both analyses, the buprestid uvs <dig> and uvs <dig> clades were recovered with high support  and sister to one another. the buprestid lws clade was recovered as nested within the other coleopteran lws opsins , with the exception of the male eab lws <dig>  which was recovered as sister to the diving beetles in the full topology , or nested within the beetles in the coleoptera-specific lws topology . the buprestid lws <dig> clade was recovered with high support in both analyses  and as sister to the lws <dig> buprestid paralogs . one notable difference between the full taxon lws topology and the coleoptera-specific lws topology is the placement of acmaeodera diffusa barr lws <dig>  which is recovered either as sister to buprestid lws <dig> opsins , or nested within the remaining buprestid lws <dig>  this is likely due to the sequence dissimilarity of acmaeodera diffusa from the other buprestid taxa, resulting in long branches. interestingly, members of acameodera generally possess pigmented coloration, and mate recognition is thought to occur on the flowers on which they feed. this is in contrast with the predominant iridescent coloration and mate-seeking behavior of most other buprestids.

the presence of a third lws opsin copy  in male eab only and the recovery of this opsin outside of the buprestidae lws clade in both full taxon and coleoptera-specific analyses are of interest. tests of opsin copy relative expression from the generated eab male and female transcriptomes yielded comparable expression levels of lws <dig> and lws <dig> between copies and sexes, as did levels of uvs <dig> and uvs <dig> opsins. lws <dig>  however, was expressed at significantly lower levels in the male eab . although the presence of a third male lws opsin may have some biological relevance in male-driven eab mate recognition strategies, discrepancies in data suggest this opsin is more likely to be residual expression from the larval life stage rather than a unique adult copy. physiological data from eab suggests a broader range of spectral sensitivities recorded in eab females  <cit>  as opposed to the copy-rich males, and the lower expression levels of lws <dig> in relation to lws1& <dig>  suggest rarity within the transcriptome. phylogenetically, the lack of lws <dig> recovery in any other buprestid taxa and molecular similarity of eab lws <dig> to a larval diving beetle and other coleoptera opsins further support this third copy as a potential larval hold-over . confirmation of this hypothesis will require the generation of additional transcriptomes across life stages to accurately characterize the eab male lws <dig> opsin. nevertheless, the loss of the sws class combined with uvs and lws opsin duplications across all buprestid taxa indicates a functional significance for opsin variability within the highly visual jewel beetles.fig.  <dig> emerald ash borer opsin gene copy expression trends: a eab male; b eab female



amino acid comparisons of opsin genes
intra- and interspecific pairwise comparisons of buprestidae across the opsin sequences for amino acid similarity, as well as comparisons of opsin paralogs in other insect taxa, are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in general, amino acid sequence similarity between paralogous opsin copies within the buprestid individuals , is noticably lower than the ranges recovered in other insects with duplications . within buprestidae, opsin copies were more similar to interspecific orthologs  than to intraspecific paralogs . the lws <dig> opsin in male eab is more similar to the lws opsins of the larval thermonectus marmoratus and all other adult beetles  than to the eab lws <dig> and lws <dig> paralogs . this degree of sequence divergence suggests that opsins have undergone greater diversification within buprestids than in other insect taxa.

opsin structure and ligand binding amino acid variations
sequence data for the recovered buprestid opsins provided us the opportunity to examine potential similarities in opsin structure and spectral sensitivities with other insects. homology-based modeling resulted in best-fit model predictions utilizing squid rhodopsin , rscb protein databank: 2z73;  <cit> ) as the template for all opsins recovered from the generated transcriptomes. to confer short-wave sensitivity in buprestids, we predict that substitutions in the uvs duplicates cause a bathochromic  shift in spectral sensitvity, and/or substitutions in the lws duplicates cause a hypsochromic  shift of the visual pigment. to investigate this possibility, we performed tests of positive selection  and analyzed the amino acid composition and structure of the chromophore binding pocket in the buprestid opsins .table  <dig> candidate residues for spectral shifting between paralogous uvs opsin copies e.g., uvs <dig> vs. uvs2) based on combined evidence

amino acid substitutions of importance
an analysis of residue substitutions in the buprestid opsin copies identified points of potential bathochromic or hypsochromic spectral variation in the copies. of particular interest are substitutions that are: 1) under ps in one opsin paralog only, 2) similar to substitutions found in other taxa at homologous sites that confer a change in spectral sensitivity , or 3) present within uvs or lws copies and introduce a residue that significantly alters the chemical nature or shape of the chromophore binding pocket . amino acid substitutions that meet several structural critera, as defined below, are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  an increase or decrease in size indicates the length of the amino acid side chain differs by more than one  atom. such changes have the potential to alter helical packing and orientation by their steric variation. a gain of polarity or charge confers the ability for hydrogen bonding, which can stabilize structure and also is important in the chromophore binding pocket for light-induced activation. likewise, a loss of polarity or charge removes the ability to hydrogen bond and creates a hydrophobic region.fig.  <dig> 3d model of acmaeodera diffusa uvs <dig>  two views shown . retinal is in orange. residues in green are those reported as potentially significant to spectral tuning in buprestidae, as listed in table  <dig>  numbering is according to bovine rhodopsin

in buprestidae uvs copies, there are  <dig> residues that meet these criteria and hence have the potential for bathochromic tuning toward blue sensitivity . of these, the a186q and y261f substitutions are significant because they change polar residues in the binding pocket, which may alter the h-bonding that occurs in an extended network from the protonated schiff base, and subsequently the activation of retinal. site  <dig> was recovered as being under ps in the buprestidae uvs <dig> opsin clade , although  <dig> was not. these two substitutions are also present in the butterfly species heliconius, which has two uvs copies  and a unique spectral sensitivity reported for each copy  <cit> . additionally, y261f has been identified in humans as one of two residues responsible for spectral tuning between red and green wavelengths in a hypsochromic direction  <cit> .

an i-l substitution between buprestidae uvs <dig> and uvs <dig> at binding pocket site  <dig> was found to be under ps in the uvs <dig> clade , and although this substitution introduces only minimal steric variation to the binding pocket, a homologous substitution in vertebrates results in a 6 nm shift in the sws opsin, with additive effects on spectral shifting when in combination with other substitutions  <cit> . a s118t binding pocket substitution in buprestidae uvs paralogs does not exhibit significant structural variation, nor was this substitution recovered as under ps, but substitutions at this homologous site exhibited ps in a lampyrid  <cit> , and a 13 nm hypsochromic shift in a lepidopteran  <cit> . three additional non-binding pocket sites with substitutions in buprestidae uvs <dig> opsins— <dig>   <dig>  and 242—were recovered as being under positive selection, exhibit some degree of significant structural variation, and are implicated in spectral shifting or under ps in other organisms . there are a number of additional substitutions within the buprestidae uvs <dig> clade  or acmaeodera diffusa uvs <dig> clade  that are under ps, exhibit significant structral changes, and/or are recovered as important in other taxa, but are not located in the binding pocket or are invariant in all buprestidae uvs opsin paralogs. these residues can be found in table  <dig> and have been mapped on an opsin reconstruction .

in buprestidae lws copies, there are  <dig> residues with the potential for bathochromic tuning toward sw sensitivity , although the correlations between specific paralogs  are less clear than in the uvs opsin copies. three substitutions are present in the binding pocket and exhibit some degree of significant structural change , but only site  <dig> was recovered as under ps in buprestidae lws <dig>  and under ps in another insect group . all three sites, however, are implicated in 2–17 nm wavelength shifts in vertebrates  <cit> . sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are located outside the chromophore binding pocket, but exhibit substitutions of structural significance, are recovered as under ps in buprestidae uvs <dig> copies , and are implicated in wavelength shifts at homologous sites in lepidoptera lws opsins  <cit>  and vertebrate sws opsins  <cit> . although substitutions at sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were shown to be under ps and implicated in several independent “blue” shifts in limenitis butterflies  <cit>  and vertebrates  <cit> , these sites were not recovered as under ps or possessing substitutions of significant structural variation in buprestidae, although additive effects on spectral tuning cannot be discounted. several other sites were recovered under ps and/or with significant structural variation in lws opsin copies of specific buprestid taxa , but variation was not present across all buprestidae lws opsin paralogs .

in summary, our uvs1/uvs <dig> buprestid copies possess five sites with amino acid substitutions in the chromophore binding pocket  and five sites outside the binding pocket  that are specific to buprestid uvs paralogs and are strongly implicated in bathochromic spectral tuning in other organisms . three buprestid lws1/lws <dig> sites in the chromophore binding pocket  and three sites outside the binding pocket  suggest hypsochromic shifts and are recovered in other organisms . note that many of these are reported to contribute to spectral tuning in other organisms and could do so through translation of structural variation to either the chromophore binding pocket or the intracellular face that binds signaling proteins. taken collectively, we provide evidence for a number of candidate sites that might enable short-wavelength sensitivity among buprestidae, which is specifically provided for by the duplication of uvs and/or lws opsin copies.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals previously unseen molecular complexity underpinning spectral sensitivity within coleoptera. previous electrophysiological work on the emerald ash borer  demonstrated a greater diversity in photoreceptor sensitivity  than the vast majority of other beetles . our results suggest that, in the absence of a sws opsin class, sensitivity has been gained through subsequent shifts in spectral sensitivity  of uvs/lws opsin duplications, achieved by specific amino acid substitutions within the opsin proteins. our analysis of potential spectral tuning sites within these copies highlights a number of substitutions that are likely to have conferred sw sensitivity within these species. this study forms the basis for future site-specific mutagenesis of the non-conserved substitutions to definitively confirm these as sites critical to spectal shifting within buprestids.

while other groups of beetles with a well-established reliance on visual cues  do not appear to possess a sws opsin or duplications of the lws/uvs, utility of and reliance on filtering and screening pigments is likely to achieve spectral shifting. both the jewel beetles and fireflies are highly visual coleopterans, although the activity periods , light environments, and natural histories  suggest fundamentally different visual systems between members of the two families. it is possible that filtering pigments play a shifting role in buprestidae as well, although the expanded spectral sensitivity recorded for agrilus planipennis, combined with the ubiquitous opsin duplication and homologous copy similarity, strongly suggest a function of biological relevance beyond filtering pigments to achieve sensitivity in a missing middle-wavelength opsin class. this work confirms that uvs/lws opsin duplications and amino acid substitutions are widespread within buprestidae, and the putative gained expansion in spectral discrimination is likely highly advantageous for a group that relies so heavily on visual cues for mate and host selection.
