BACKGROUND
dna methylation, a conserved epigenetic mechanism involved in many important biological processes, is associated with gene silencing, x chromosome inactivation in females, and maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes  <cit> . dna methylation protects against transposon proliferation and impacts genomic imprinting  <cit> .

similar to mammalian genomes, dna methylation in plant genomes predominantly occurs at cpg site. this is maintained by methyltransferase <dig> , a homolog of dna methyltransferase <dig> . in addition, plants dna methylation occurs at cphpg and cphph sites, and is maintained by chromomethylase <dig>   <cit> . in plant, dna glycosidase subfamily including demeter  and repressor of silencing  <dig>  could mediate demethylation  <cit> . although the methylated cytosine contexts in animals and plants are different, dna methylation is conserved in both tes and genes. in animals, plants and fungi, the active genes are generally unmethylated, while tes are heavily methylated. however, green algae have an unusual pattern of methylation compared to other eukaryotes. more methylation was detected in exons to compare with tes regions  <cit> .

there is strong evidence that dna methylation in promoter region represses gene expression  <cit> . in rice, methylation of transcriptional termination region  showed stronger repression effect on gene expression to compare with promoter methylation  <cit> . results showed that gene-body methylation were positively associated with gene expression  <cit> . however, dna methylation in the first exon was found to associate with gene silencing  <cit> .

bisulfite sequencing has been used to detect the methylated cytosines  <cit> . this method is very accurate to find the methylated cytosine of the individual locus. however, it is difficult to explore genome-wide methylation. msap  has been used to explore the genome-wide methylation, but it can only detect few methylation fractions and is limited by the types of enzymes used. sequencing-based and microarray-based high-throughput detection of dna methylation approaches are widely used in genome-wide methylation studies. dna methylation microarray, dna immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing  and bisulfite libraries construction combined with high-throughput sequencing are proved to be efficient  <cit> . these approaches have been used to discover global methylation dynamics in different plant species including arabidopsis  <cit> , sorghum  <cit>  and rice  <cit> .

several studies reported the differential dna methylated regions which were correlated with variable gene expression within the examined tissues  <cit> . results showed that the difference of dna methylation could only account for a limited extend of gene expression variation among plant vegetative tissues  <cit> .

dna methylation is very important for plant embryogenesis and seed development. abnormal embryo methylation causes defect in embryogenesis, such as abnormal of cell division, embryo apical domain aberrance and reduction of viability  <cit> . in seed plants, gene imprinting occurs in endosperm  <cit> . studies showed that the expression of only a small portion of imprinting genes was correlated with dna methylation in arabidopsis  <cit> . the expression level of maize imprinting genes was much higher in endosperm than in embryo  <cit> . tes exhibited toxic effects on genome, and embryo represses parasitic tes to prevent damage of genome during seed development. dna methylation on tes is an important way to repress tes  <cit> . tes silencing relies mainly on rnai pathway directed methylation, and sirna is the major mediator for cphph dna methylation  <cit> . large amount of small rna was accumulated in rice endosperm. however, the cphph methylation level of endosperm is quite low, while the embryo cphph methylation level is rather high. the major methylation in rice endosperm is cphph, suggesting rnai pathway does not participate in endosperm dna methylation. the endosperm derived small rnas could be transported to embryo where they mediate tes silencing by dna methylation  <cit> .

in plants, endosperm dna was hypomethylated in various sequence contexts. for example, rice endosperm cg methylation is about 93% of the methylation rate in embryos. chg and chh methylation is by 2– <dig> folds lower in endosperm compared to embryo. in arabidopsis, cg methylation of most loci is demethylated in endosperm  <cit> . in arabidopsis ecotype col-gl and ler, thousands of genes exhibited higher level of methylation in embryo than that in endosperm  <cit> .

previous studies on dna methylation in embryo and endosperm using dna methylation microarray, immunoprecipitation and msap have assessed only a small portion of tissue-specific dna methylation variations in maize genome  <cit> . in the current study, we used solexa medip-seq to profile the methylomic landscape across embryo and endosperm, comparing the differences of their methylation modes. many genes that were differentially methylated between embryo and endosperm were identified.

characterization of methylated dna regions
we analyzed the methylation status of cpg islands , cgi shores  as well as other locations in the genome. cpg island in maize genome was identified using cpg report software . the default parameters are as following: the minimum length is 200 bp, minimum observed/expected value is  <dig> , the minimum percentage of cpg content is 50% . in total,  <dig>  cgis were identified in this study. additional file 1: file s1a, additional file 2: file s1b, additional file 3: file s1c lists all cpg islands of whole maize genome. the locations of cpg islands on chromosomes, the length of the island and the observed/expected value were also provided. 2000 bp up- or down-stream of cpg island was considered to be the cpg shore  <cit> . if a cpg shore was overlapped with the methylation region identified in this study, we considered that this cpg shore was methylated.

there were  <dig>  methylated cgis and  <dig>  methylated cgi shores in embryo, and  <dig>  methylated cgis and  <dig>  methylated cgi shores in endosperm. in both embryo and endosperm, less cgis were methylated compared to cgi shores . most cg islands were unmethylated , which was in agreement with the methylation profiles in human and pig  <cit> . methylation status of embryo and endosperm was analyzed in promoter, exon, intron, transcriptional termination region, 5’ utr, 3’ utr and coding sequences . gene regions that overlapped with dna methylation peaks were considered methylated. methylated promoters and transcriptional termination region  could be classified into four types by cpg content: high cpg content promoters , low cpg content promoters , high cpg content ttrs  and low cpg content ttrs  as previously described  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we detected  <dig>  methylated promoters and  <dig>  methylated ttrs in maize endosperm genome, while  <dig>  methylated promoters and  <dig>  methylated ttrs in maize embryo were identified. the dna methylation occurred more frequently in promoter and ttr regions than other gene regions .

in embryo,  <dig>  methylated hcps,  <dig>  methylated lcps,  <dig>  methylated hcttrs and  <dig>  methylated lcttrs were detected. endosperm contained much less methylated hcps , lcps , hcttrs  and lcttrs  . we also analyzed the methylation levels within introns and exons in embryo and endosperm. there were  <dig>  methylated exons and  <dig>  methylated introns in embryo, and  <dig>  methylated exons,  <dig>  methylated introns in endosperm. figure  <dig> shows that the promoter and ttr were more methylated than the gene body  on average.figure  <dig>

the transposase genes that overlapped with dna methylation peak were considered methylated tes. in maize seed, we detected  <dig> methylated tes which contain mudr transposon, gypsy-type retrotransposon, copia sub-class retrotransposon, cacta sub-class transposon and other types of transposons by blastx against nr protein database. only two of these tes were not methylated in embryo, while  <dig> of them were not methylated in endosperm .

characterization of differential methylated region 
we identified dna methylation regions using a newly developed method. any peak detected in embryo overlapping with peaks in endosperm, we will select the genomic region covering them as one dna methylation region. if a peak detected in embryo  doesn’t overlap with any peak from endosperm , we also considered the genomic region covering the peak to be a dna methylation region in embryo or endosperm. thus,  <dig>  dna methylation regions were identified in this study.

the read number of each methylated region from embryo or endosperm was used to calculate the normalized log <dig> value  and test p-value using the degseq r package. if normalized log <dig> value > <dig>  and p <  <dig> , the methylated region was considered up-methylated in embryo, and down-methylated in endosperm. if normalized log <dig> value <  <dig> and p <  <dig> , the methylated region was considered up-methylated in endosperm, and down-methylated in embryo.

among the identified  <dig>  methylated regions,  <dig>  regions were differentially methylated between embryo and endosperm . totally,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially methylated regions  were up-methylated in embryo and endosperm, respectively.

more dmrs were located in cgi shore to compare with cgi. in promoter and ttr, we found more dmrs to compare with intron and exon. in embryo, more up-methylated dmrs were distributed in promoters and ttrs than intron and exon, while more down-methylated dmrs were distributed in promoter and ttr in endosperm. in embryo, more up-methylated dmrs could overlap with promoter, ttr, intron and exon to compare with endosperm . the overlapped up-methylated dmrs of some promoters, ttrs, introns and exons were plotted using the integrative genomics viewer  software .figure  <dig>

promoter, ttr, intron and exon overlapped up-methylated dmrs in embryo. some gene regions overlapped with the up-methylated dmrs in embryo, such as grmzm2g <dig> promoter , grmzm2g <dig> ttr , grmzm2g <dig> exon  and grmzm2g <dig> intron . red boxes were the dmrs that were up-methylated in embryo and down-methylated in endosperm. the arrow on gene structure represents the direction of transcription.



function annotation of the methylated genes
function annotation of the methylated genes was carried out by blastx against non-redundant  protein database. information from proteins with the highest similarity to the given methylated gene was used to annotate the gene function. the encoding proteins of the methylated genes were further compared with kegg . totally,  <dig>  methylated genes were annotated by blastx analysis. some ribosomal protein, storage protein, lea  protein encoding genes and imprinting genes were found methylated. many genes encoding transcription factors, such as wrky, sbp, nac, myb, bzip families were methylated .

the methylated genes were predicted to be involved in  <dig> metabolic pathways based on kegg database. many methylated genes encoding proteins involved in chromatin structure and dna synthesis, cell cycle regulation, nitrogen metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and elongation, starch and sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein metabolism, brassinosteriod biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, hormone metabolism and signal transduction pathways . these results indicated that dna methylation was involved in a wide range of biological processes.

differentially methylated genes in maize embryo and endosperm
of the  <dig>  annotated methylated genes,  <dig> in embryo, and  <dig>  in endosperm were de-methylated. many genes were only methylated in embryo but not in endosperm and many genes are more methylated in embryo than endosperm . some of these genes may contribute to epigenetic inheritance and reprogramming across generations, for example, gene encoding dna-3-methyladenine glycosylase i, gene encoding histone deacetylase, lysine-specific histone demethylase and histone-arginine methyltransferase. some genes are associated with cell differentiation and vascular development, for example, the zf-hd-type transcription factor, tcp-1/cpn <dig> chaperonin family protein and tcp family protein. some genes are involved in hormone metabolism and signal transduction pathways, such as abi3/vp <dig> type transcription factor, auxin response factor , aux/iaa family, gras family transcription factor, b <dig> dna binding domain family protein, gid1-like gibberellin receptor, and brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig>  gene involved in cell fate determination, gebp type transcription factor  <cit> , was identified. wox family proteins, key regulators of embryo development, were detected in this study. genes encoding key enzymes in starch synthesis, for example, starch synthase i, starch branching enzyme iib and granule-bound starch synthase precursor were detected differentially methylated. dicer-like  and argonaute , key enzymes of small rna biogenesis pathway were found to be more methylated in embryo than in endosperm. bhlh and mads-box transcription factor also showed more methylation in embryo than in endosperm .

gene ontology  enrichment of differentially methylated genes
all methylated genes were annotated based on go annotation. additional file 11: table s <dig> shows the go categories and function of methylated genes.

to better understand the potential function of the differential methylated genes, go functional classification of these genes was performed by blast2go program. fisher’s exact test p-values were calculated for overrepresentation of the differential methylated genes  in all go categories. go terms with p <  <dig>  were considered as significant enriched. totally,  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched, with  <dig> in cellular component,  <dig> in molecular function and  <dig> in biological process. in biological process, the most significantly enriched differentially methylated genes are related to photosynthesis, electron transport chain, and respiratory electron transport chain. in cellular component, the most significantly enriched genes are related to chloroplast, photosynthetic membrane, and thylakoid part. while, in molecular function, the most significantly enriched genes are involved in quinone binding, nadh dehydrogenase  and nadh dehydrogenase  activity .table  <dig>

methylation and transcriptional repression of imprinting genes
previous studies demonstrated that some imprinting genes in endosperm were associated with dna methylation  <cit> . in maize endosperm,  <dig> % of the analyzed imprinting genes showed differential methylation between the two parental alleles  <cit> . we examined the correlation between expression of imprinting genes and dna methylation level in embryo and endosperm. we analyzed the methylation mode of  <dig> imprinting genes identified by zhang  <cit> . only  <dig> out of the  <dig> imprinting genes were detected to be methylated in embryo or endosperm. thirty eight of the methylated genes were only methylated in embryo, suggesting that these imprinting genes were not associated with allelic silencing in endosperm. five of the methylated genes were only methylated in endosperm, suggesting that these imprinting genes were not associated with allelic silencing in embryo.

based on the transcription data  <cit> , we found  <dig> of the methylated genes showed much higher expression level in endosperm than in embryo , among them, the majority  of genes were more methylated or only methylated in embryo, four of them were more methylated in endosperm or only methylated in endosperm and the methylation level of rest four genes was similar between embryo and endosperm.

 <dig> of the methylated genes showed much higher expression level in embryo than in endosperm , among them, one of the  <dig> genes was more methylated in endosperm,  <dig> were more methylated in embryo, and the rest  <dig> genes showed similar methylation level between embryo and endosperm.

the rest  <dig> methylated genes showed similar expression level between endosperm and embryo, among them, ten of the  <dig> genes were more methylated in embryo, the rest  <dig> genes showed similar methylation level between embryo and endosperm. totally, among the  <dig> imprinting genes which were methylated in embryo or endosperm,  <dig> % were methylated similarly between embryo and endosperm, while  <dig> % were differentially methylated . these results showed that only a small portion of the imprinting genes were regulated by dna methylation.

a maize dme-like gene  and a mbd4-like gene  were identified in this study. the dme-like gene encodes 5-methylcytosine dna glycosylase, and mbd4-like gene encodes methylation-binding domain  <dig> protein. maize dme-like  is homologous to arabidopsis dme  and contains hhh-gpd base excision dna repair protein domain. maize mbd4-like np_ <dig>  is homologous to arabidopsis mbd <dig>  and contains methyl-cpg-binding domain. dme participates in demethylation of the maternal genome in endosperm  <cit> . overexpression of mbd4/aid gene caused bulk genome de-methylation in zebra fish  <cit> . the expression levels of dme-like and mbd4-like gene were all higher in maize endosperm . therefore, high transcriptional activity of these two genes could be associated with the low methylation level in endosperm.figure  <dig>

discussion
our data showed the different pattern of dna methylation between maize embryo and endosperm. embryo contained more dna methylation peaks to compare with endosperm in each chromosome.

more dna methylation peaks were located in cgi shores compared to cgis and other gene regions, which is in agreement with the results from human. cgi shore also contained more dmrs than cgi. more dmrs were distributed in promoters and ttrs than introns and exons. many studies showed that lcps were more methylated than hcps  <cit> , we found the same result in maize. in maize, we found that ttrs methylation may have similar function to promoter methylation, which is in agreement with previous study  <cit> . we found that lcttrs contained more dna methylation peaks than the hcttrs. more dmrs were up-methylated in embryo than in endosperm. this methylation may cause tissue-specific expression of genes between embryo and endosperm. our results showed that  <dig> % imprinting genes were differentially methylated between embryo and endosperm. methylation level could be negatively or positively correlated with the expression level of imprinting genes. methylation level was associated with allelic silencing of only a small number of imprinting genes.

starch is a major component of maize endosperm and comprises two different forms of carbohydrate polymers: a linear amylose and a branched amylopectin. our results showed that the genes encoding starch synthase i, starch branching enzyme iib  and granule-bound starch synthase precursor  were more methylated in embryo than in endosperm. the expression levels of these genes were much higher in endosperm than in embryo, which was consistent with previous transcriptome data  <cit> . both gbss and starch synthase i showed embryo specific dna methylated, and the methylated regions were located in promoter. sbeiib gene promoter was methylated only in embryo and intron was more methylated in embryo than in endosperm. this is in agreement with previous studies that sbeii and gbss promoters are endosperm-specific promoters  <cit> . tissue-specific promoters may contain tissue-specific cis-elements, for example, ry motif  <cit>  or other elements, for example, ggatcc palindrome, which could be recognized by dna methyltransferases  <cit> . ggatcc was detected in maize sbeiib gene promoter. it is possible that the promoters of the above described three genes were de-methylated in endosperm, and promoter methylation of these genes in embryo was associated with their transcription repression. in addition, genes in starch synthesis and metabolism, such as isoamylase-type starch debranching enzyme iso <dig>  starch branching enzyme iia, starch synthase iiib- <dig>  starch phosphorylase and starch binding domain containing family protein genes were all methylated mainly in promoter region only in embryo. these genes were hypermethylated in embryo and hypomethylated in endosperm.

storage protein zein and oleosin genes were found to be more methylated in embryo than in endosperm. zein gene expression level was higher in endosperm than in embryo  <cit> . the 15 kda beta zein, 22 kda alpha zein <dig>  22 kda alpha zein  <dig> and 22 kda alpha zein  <dig> encoding genes were methylated specifically in embryo. the dmr of 15 kda beta zein encoding gene was located in ttr, while the dmrs of other three genes all located in exon. the methylated level and the expression level of zeins were negatively correlated. oleosins are key components of oil body. in maize seed, the expression level of 16 kda oleosin gene and zm-ii oleosin gene was higher in embryo compared to endosperm. however, our data clearly showed that these two genes were methylated in embryo but not in endosperm. the methylation was located in promoter and ttr regions. the methylation level of these oleosin genes was not negatively correlated with their expression.

wuschel-related homeobox  transcription factor is necessary for cell division that forms the apical domain of embryo. in maize embryo, the wox <dig> promoter and ttr was hypermethylated, however, this gene was highly expressed in embryo. in embryos of arabidopsis met1- <dig> mutant, expression level of de-methylated wox <dig> is lower than the hypermethylated wox <dig> in wild-type embryo  <cit> . this result suggested that methylation could enhance wox <dig> expression in embryo. gene methylation could repress or active gene expression, and sometimes gene methylation may not correlate with transcription  <cit> .

a hypothesis is that te silencing is through the rnai pathway. small rnas may be transported from endosperm to embryo where they lead to sirna or mirna-mediated methylation of tes. the evidence is that abundant te-derived small rnas were accumulated in endosperm in arabidopsis, but extremely low levels of chh methylation occurs in endosperm. in contrast, high chh methylation was detected in embryo  <cit> . in other words, the link between rnai and dna methylation may be weakened in endosperm and the small rnas could be taken away. in our study, tes were more methylated in embryo than in endosperm, possibly due to the imported small rna. if this is true, it could explain, at least in part, the hypomethylation of endosperm. we identified a maize dme-like gene and a mbd4-like gene, and found that their expression levels were higher in maize endosperm than in embryo. dme and mbd <dig> could mediate strong bulk genome dna demethylation. therefore, the differentially expressed dme-like and mbd <dig> genes could be a possible reason for the differential methylation patterns in embryo and endosperm.

CONCLUSIONS
through medip-seq we systematically analyzed the methylomes of maize embryo and endosperm and results indicated that the global methylation status of embryo was more than that of the endosperm. differences could be observed at the total number of methylation peaks, dmrs and specific methylated genes which were tightly associated with development of embryo and endosperm. our results also revealed that many dna methylation regions didn’t affect transcription of the corresponding genes.
