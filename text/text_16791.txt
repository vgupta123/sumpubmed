BACKGROUND
bone marrow transplantation  has widespread therapeutic potential in the treatment of hematological malignancies, genetic defects in the hematopoietic system and autoimmunity  <cit> . the goal of achieving solid organ transplantation tolerance may also be facilitated by the induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism following the transplantation of donor bone marrow   <cit> . it has been a long held assumption that the engraftment of bone marrow transplants requires the creation of "space" in the host. "space" has usually been created using myeloablative conditioning regimens that include gamma irradiation or cytotoxic agents, both associated with undesirable side effects. as a consequence, there have been efforts to minimize the myeloablative conditioning by developing protocols where engraftment is facilitated with the combination of monoclonal antibodies   <cit> . the intensity of myelosuppressive conditioning strategies, such as low-dose total body irradiation or busulfan, is able to be reduced by the use of anti-cd40l mabs   <cit> . large or "mega-doses" of donor bm have also been shown to be helpful in promoting engraftment  <cit> . "mega-doses" of donor bone marrow and anti-cd40l mabs in the presence  <cit>  or absence of donor specific transfusion  <cit> , are sufficient to ensure stable bone marrow engraftment in the absence of myelosuppression. we now demonstrate that a combination of mabs , previously shown capable of inducing dominant transplantation tolerance to allogeneic skin grafts  <cit> , permits the engraftment of donor marrow in some strain combinations. this leads to long-term chimerism and transplantation tolerance without the need for mega-doses of donor bone marrow or myelosuppressive conditioning.

RESULTS
mixed chimerism and tolerance using a conventional dose of donor bm without the need for myelosuppression
to establish the minimum number of marrow cells needed to achieve chimerism and tolerance, cba mice were treated with three doses of  <dig> mg of each of the blocking mabs to cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> l on alternate days  <dig> weeks prior to bmt, transplanted with different numbers of t cell-depleted b <dig> bm cells, and further treated with  <dig> mg of the same antibodies on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> relative to bmt . peripheral blood samples were collected  <dig> days  and  <dig> days following bmt, and the level of chimerism was quantified by flow cytometry . chimerism was found to be stable since the levels detected at these two time points were always similar in any individual mouse. all animals transplanted with 1× <dig>  2× <dig> or 4× <dig> t cell-depleted bm cells had detectable levels of chimerism, as did one mouse transplanted with 5× <dig> bm cells. all mice transplanted with 1× <dig> bm cells demonstrated no detectable chimerism.

to determine whether tolerance was dependent on the degree of chimerism, all mice were challenged with donor type skin grafts on day  <dig> following bmt. in addition, f <dig> skin was transplanted on day  <dig> to determine whether any tolerance observed was dominant, in which linked suppression  <cit>  would be the expected outcome. all animals that had detectable chimerism accepted donor-type skin indefinitely . f <dig> skin grafts were readily rejected by all mice  indicating that we could not elicit linked suppression and dominant tolerance.

these data demonstrate, therefore, that 1× <dig> t cell-depleted bm cells together with this particular antibody protocol, is sufficient to achieve stable mixed chimerism, and a non-dominant form of transplantation tolerance. remarkably, this is achieved in the absence of myeloablative or myelosuppressive conditioning.

antibody first-stage treatment of the recipient is helpful in enabling bone marrow engraftment
we examined the requirements for a first-stage treatment in overcoming the immunologic resistance to bm engraftment. cba or balb/c mice were transplanted with different doses of donor bm and treated with  <dig> ×  <dig> mg of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd40l mabs at the time of bmt, in the presence or absence of antibody treatment  <dig> weeks in advance of bmt. only animals treated with the first-stage antibody-treatment in advance of bmt had detectable chimerism . mice transplanted with bm in the absence of first-stage treatment, readily rejected donor type skin grafts transplanted  <dig> days following bmt .

the successful treatment regime used above was not, however, effective in b <dig> mice that had been transplanted with 2× <dig> t cell-depleted bm from cba donors. chimerism was less than 1% and all mice rejected donor-type skin .

although antibody-treatment was critical at the time of bmt , first-stage treatment did not, however, seem to be an absolute requirement in all experiments. in one experiment, we observed that omission of the cd40l mab made no difference to the efficacy of the first-stage treatment , while in another we actually achieved long term engraftment in the absence of any first-stage treatment whatsoever . clearly, there are variations between experiments in the need for first-stage treatment, but more importantly, treatment with cd <dig> and cd <dig> mabs does seem to guarantee routine success in permissive strains. it should be noted that cd <dig> mabs on their own could not be tested for the first-stage treatment because they lead to sensitization to rat antibodies, nullifying the efficacy of subsequent antibody administration  <cit> . this does not happen when cd <dig> antibodies are combined with cd <dig> or cd40l antibodies.

to investigate the impact of the first-stage treatment on t cell populations, spleen cells from animals treated with cd <dig> and cd <dig> mabs were collected  <dig> weeks following treatment  and analysed by flow cytometry. antibody-treated mice showed a marked reduction in cd8+ t cells . relative to untreated controls, antibody-treated mice had a significantly higher frequency of cd44+ cells amongst cd8+ cells. small but significant changes within the cd4+ population were observed, including an increase of cd44+ and cd25+ cells in antibody-treated mice.

# only gated cd3+ cells were taken into account for these calculations

anti-cd40l mab is a necessary component of the second stage treatment
we investigated whether a 2-stage protocol consisting solely of co-receptor blockade with omission of co-stimulation blockade would still enable the engraftment of donor bm. all mice received the first-stage treatment consisting of co-receptor blockade alone initiated  <dig> weeks before transplantation. at the time of transfer of 2× <dig> t cell-depleted b <dig> bone marrow cells, the mice were split into three groups. one group received cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd40l mabs; a second received cd <dig> and cd <dig> mabs and a third received no mabs. chimerism was only achieved in the group which received the triple cocktail at the time of bm transplantation.

bone marrow engraftment in congenic mouse strains
based on the failure of the 2-stage protocol to enable engraftment in b <dig> recipients of cba bone marrow, we turned to a congenic system to provide a less stringent immunological barrier. in  <dig> experiments, no engraftment was observed in b <dig> recipients of congenic b <dig> cd <dig>  bone marrow in the absence of antibody-treatment, while control cba recipients which received the 2-stage protocol were chimeric . b <dig> recipients of the 2-stage antibody protocol plus congenic b <dig> cd <dig>  bone marrow showed low but significant levels of chimerism  .

we investigated whether bm engraftment in congenic mice might be facilitated by targeting nk cells. the specific targeting of nk cells by treatment with anti-nk <dig>  antibody five days prior to bmt did not, however, enable bm engraftment .

discussion
these new data show that a combination of antibodies targeting the cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell co-receptors plus the cd40l molecule can facilitate bone marrow engraftment in the absence of any myelosuppressive conditioning of the recipient. a dose of marrow as low as 1× <dig> t cell-depleted bm  could establish mixed chimerism detectable  <dig> days following bmt. this state of mixed chimerism was sufficient to enable long-term acceptance of donor type skin allografts. although the level of chimerism achieved was found to vary between experiments, we confirmed by titrating the dose of bone marrow, that even low levels of chimerism are maintained long-term, and these are compatible with long-term acceptance of skin grafts.

we have previously observed the resistance of b <dig> mice to tolerance induction to skin grafts by our antibody protocols  <cit> . in this study, the same was found for bone marrow transplants. a congenic system was employed to test the effect of the full 2-stage protocol in a system where the intensity of the allogeneic response is markedly reduced, although some antigenicity of the cd <dig>  allele has been reported  <cit> . the levels of chimerism achieved in congenic b <dig> recipients were lower than fully allogeneic cba recipients , showing a relative resistance of b <dig> recipients to engraftment of donor hematopoeitic stem cells. the mechanism of resistance to engraftment is unclear, but it may be that 'resident' b <dig> stem cells enjoy an advantage in competing for 'niches', for instance by being more abundant than in the other strains  <cit> . there are several reports in which mixed chimerism was achieved in b <dig> recipients by combining co-stimulation blockade with either irradiation or 'megadoses' of bone marrow  <cit> . interestingly, targeting cd40l alone was sufficient for chimerism in mhc-mismatched b <dig> br recipients of b <dig> bone marrow  <cit> , a donor-recipient combination which shares 'minors'. unlike b <dig> mice, it seems b <dig> br recipients  do not display resistance to donor stem cell engraftment, which therefore might be associated with the h-2b haplotype of the mhc.

we were surprised by the variability in the requirement for the first-stage antibody-treatment in engraftment of donor stem cells. this variability between experiments may be explained by the combined treatment being capable of minimizing some component of heterologous immunity; that is, a heightened state of alloreactivity as a result of exposure to environmental antigens  <cit> , which could vary between groups of experimental mice. the partial depletion of cd8+ cells by the first-stage treatment  was also unexpected because the isotype of the cd <dig> antibody used is rat igg2a, which is the same isotype as the patently non-depleting cd <dig> antibody used. we have observed this same cd <dig> antibody to be non-depleting in previous studies  <cit> . this 'blocking' cd <dig> antibody may hinder tcr interactions with self mhc molecules, and the level of cd8+ t cell loss might be determined, again, by environmental factors. our data suggest when cd8+ t cell loss occurred, it was predominantly seen in the antigen-inexperienced cd44- pool, which could include alloantigen-specific naïve t cells. the first-stage treatment impacts the cd4+ subset also, as there is a small but significant increase in the percentage of cd4+ cells expressing memory and activation markers, such as cd <dig> and cd <dig>  taken together, our results indicate there are systematic variables surmounted reliably by the 2-stage protocol, which appears to ensure donor stem cell engraftment in susceptible strains.

the use of co-stimulation blockade with a cd40l mab alone has been reported as effective in inducing bm engraftment, without the need for myeloblative conditioning, although this required a dose of bm one order of magnitude greater than in our present study  <cit> . seung and collaborators have reported that bm engraftment  can be facilitated, in the absence of myelosuppression, by prior infusion of dst under the cover of anti-cd40l mabs, or co-administration of cd40l and cd <dig> antibodies in the absence of dst  <cit> . furthermore, anti-cd40l mabs have been also shown useful in enabling the engraftment of clinically attainable doses of bone marrow with reduced intensity conditioning regimes, even in resistant strains such as b <dig> mice  <cit> . detailed mechanistic studies have identified a potent effect of cd40l antibodies on host t cells when allogeneic single cell suspensions are delivered intravenously . the propensity of host t cells, which recognize the alloantigens, to die under these circumstances is well described  <cit> . we report that anti-cd40l was an essential component of the treatment protocol at the time of transplantation to allow mhc-mismatched bone marrow to engraft. further work has demonstrated that an aglycosyl cd40l mab with impaired binding to complement and fc receptors efficiently enabled engraftment in this protocol .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies showed that, in the absence of further conditioning, targeting either the t cell co-receptors  <cit>  or the cd40l molecule  <cit> failed to enable bm engraftment if the mismatch was across both minor and major histocompatibility barriers. our combined targeting of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> co-receptors and the cd40l molecule in a 2-stage protocol seems truly synergistic. similar protocols offer an alternative to co-stimulation blockade alone in enabling the induction of mixed chimerism as part of a non-myeloablative protocol, or by allowing the reduction of the cytoreductive component, for treatment of non-malignant diseases, as well as for malignant diseases prior to the use of donor lymphocyte infusions to eradicate the tumour.
