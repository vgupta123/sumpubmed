BACKGROUND
in a number of animal and plant viruses the replication and transcription complexes as well as nucleocapsids, assembly intermediates and virions, accumulate in specific virus induced structures within the host cell cytoplasm described as 'virus assembly factories' or 'virus inclusion bodies'   <cit> . similar to other members of the reoviridae family, orbiviruses use such specific sites for virus replication and the assembly of virion particles. bluetongue virus , the prototype orbivirus, enters the host cells via the two outer capsid proteins, its receptor binding protein vp <dig> and penetration protein vp <dig>  <cit> . once the virion is internalized, both outer capsid proteins are lost within the endosome and the core, consisting of two major , three minor enzymatic  proteins and a genome of ten double-stranded rna  segments, is released into the cytoplasm. the released core becomes very rapidly associated with a matrix that gradually surrounds the particles to form vibs. as the infection progresses, these vibs increase both in size and number and appear to be the sites of orbivirus replication and early viral assembly  <cit> . this has largely been inferred from electron microscopy data on the localization of incomplete virus particles within vibs.

beside the seven structural proteins, btv also produces four non-structural proteins  in infected cells. recently it has been reported that ns <dig>  which is produced abundantly in infected cells is involved in viral morphogenesis, and the two smallest proteins, ns <dig> and ns3a are involved in virus egress  <cit> . the involvement of the  <dig> kda ns <dig> in virus assembly is also gradually being delineated. ns <dig> is the only btv protein that undergoes phosphorylation  <cit> . it is a highly charged hydrophilic protein and exists as a 7s multimeric complex  <cit> . ns <dig> possesses a single-stranded rna binding activity and also has a nucleotidyl phosphatase activity  <cit> . these observations suggest that ns <dig> may have a role in the recruitment and/or retention of rna for replication.

expression of btv ns <dig> in both, insect and mammalian cells, results in the formation of inclusion bodies  that are indistinguishable from the vibs found in virus-infected cells, indicating that ns <dig> is the major component of the vibs  <cit> . to date, the distribution and localization of btv proteins and rnas within the infected cell have mainly been studied by electron microscopy  <cit> . however, the correlation between what is observed and what is occurring at the molecular level is relatively poor. nevertheless, the presence of the core, nucleic acids and morphogenic intermediates at the periphery of the vibs has led to the proposal that replication and assembly of btv take place within this electron dense structure  <cit> . in this study we provide experiments to confirm, extend and substantiate the role of ns <dig> in virus assembly and replication. we describe the generation of several inducible mammalian cell lines expressing complete ns <dig> as well as different fragments of ns <dig> including a fragment consisting of the major rna binding domains  <cit> . analysis of these stable cell lines have confirmed that ns <dig> alone induces the formation of ibs similar to vibs in btv infected cells and that they are also capable of recruiting viral core proteins and mrnas. the ib function of ns <dig> is essential for virus replication and correct trafficking. infection of cell lines expressing truncated fragments not only interferes with virus replication but also alters the cellular distribution of btv particles in accordance with this model.

RESULTS
expression of full-length ns <dig> in mammalian cells is sufficient for ib formation
in order to generate sufficient level of ns <dig> protein in the absence of other btv proteins, a mammalian cell line which expresses ns <dig> has been established using a tet-off inducible expression system. this is a stringent and tightly controlled gene expression system where the removal of doxycycline from the culture media results in high level transcription of the cloned gene. the full-length ns <dig> gene was pcr amplified and cloned into ptre2-hyg vector, transfected into bsr cells and stable cell lines were selected in the presence of hygromycin as described in the materials and methods. generation of cell lines was confirmed by rt-pcr using specific pairs of primers  and ultimately the production of protein was confirmed by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitating the expressed proteins .

to examine whether the ns <dig> expressing cells synthesize structures resembling vibs, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-ns <dig> antibody . the presence of different sizes of globular, dense inclusions was easily detectable in the cells expressing ns <dig> in the absence of doxycycline. these structures morphologically resemble vibs in btv infected bsr cells but the sizes in the latter appear to be larger and comparatively less scattered. the globular structures, in the case of the ns <dig> expressing cells, were not produced in the presence of  <dig> Î¼g/ml doxycycline , which suppresses ns <dig> protein expression. these results demonstrate that a continuous mammalian cell line with regulated expression of full-length ns <dig> protein was constructed.

formation of ns <dig> ibs is not dependent on either cellular microtubule network or intermediate filaments
a previous electron microscopy  study has shown that during btv infection virus-like particles and vibs were associated with the intermediate filament component of cytoskeleton and not with intact microfilament or microtubule structures  <cit> . to investigate if the ibs produced by the stable cell lines behave in a similar manner we undertook an immunofluorescence study in the presence and absence of nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing drug. if ibs formation is dependent on tubulin, depolymerization should interfere in the formation and migration of ibs during the dynamic stage of production. for comparison we included btv infected cells in parallel. we chose to treat the cells with drug at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection  since high density of vibs are commonly visible in btv infected cells between  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i  <cit> . from figure 2a it was evident that there was no obvious disruption or reorganization of ib formation between untreated cells or drug treated cells. the distribution of punctuate structures of ns <dig> ibs in ns <dig> expressing cells or vibs in btv infected cells were not affected by presence of nocodazole, although the ordered arrangement of microtubules compared to untreated cells was significantly disrupted . thus, the data indicate that ns <dig> ib formation is not dependent on cellular microtubules similar to that of btv vibs. this result also confirmed a previous finding from em studies that microtubules were not involved in inclusion body morphogenesis  <cit> .

for other members of the family a clear association between the virus particle, inclusions and the intermediate filament protein vimentin has been shown which was accompanied by significant changes in the vimentin filament network of the cells resulting in a sheath-like structure surrounding the inclusions  <cit> . to determine whether this association applied to ns <dig> ibs and if ibs in ns <dig> cells have similar effects on vimentin, ns <dig> expressing cells and btv infected cells , were labeled with anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody  and anti-ns <dig> polyclonal antibody . the distribution of respective proteins was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. unlike reoviruses, neither ns <dig> ibs nor btv induced vibs were surrounded by cage-like structures. this suggests that the filament network of cells is not involved in vib formation and that ns <dig> ib, like vib, does not require these filaments.

the core proteins of btv, but not the outer capsid protein vp <dig>  is targeted to ns <dig> ibs
to investigate whether ns <dig> alone is sufficient to recruit the viral structural proteins into the ibs, we have monitored the localization of three major viral structural proteins; vp <dig> , vp <dig>  and vp <dig> . each protein was expressed by transfecting plasmids into either control bsr cells  or bsr cells expressing ns <dig> protein . in addition, normal bsr cells infected by btv were also used for comparison. the distribution of each protein was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-vp <dig>  anti-vp <dig> or anti-vp <dig> antibody and inclusions were identified by using anti-ns <dig> antibody. when the distribution of ns <dig> and vp <dig> were monitored in ns2-bsr cells at  <dig> h post transfection by confocal microscopy  no co-localization of vp <dig> and ns <dig> ibs could be detected and vp <dig> was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, similar to the control bsr cells . further, when the distribution pattern of vp <dig> in ns <dig> expressing cells was compared with btv infected cells , again no difference in vp <dig> distribution could be detected. therefore the presence of other btv components did not influence the vp <dig> intracellular localization.

in contrast, the distribution of vp <dig> in ns <dig> expressing cells was different to its distribution in btv infected cells. although vp <dig> was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in ns <dig> expressing cells similar to the control, uninduced bsr cells , the distribution of vp <dig> was markedly different in btv infected cells at  <dig> h p.i. all vibs showed co-localization between ns <dig> and vp <dig>  although there were also some foci of vp <dig> outside of vibs . evidently intracellular vp <dig> distribution is influenced by the presence of other btv proteins.

in contrast to vp <dig> and vp <dig>  the distribution of vp <dig> relative to ibs was strikingly different. in microscopy studies vp <dig> was exclusively localized within the vibs in both ns <dig> expressing cells and in btv infected cells . the result was similar to that obtained recently with an egfp tagged vp <dig> protein in btv infected bsr cells  <cit> . these results are not surprising since vp <dig> is closely associated with the three core proteins  that form the transcription complex and the btv ssrna. this complex subsequently generates the assembly intermediate, the single layered subcore particle which takes place within the vibs. this data also confirmed our previous study that used transient expression of ns <dig> and core proteins  <cit> . along with the previous publication, these data support the conclusion that unlike vp <dig>  vp <dig> and inner transcription complex are closely associated with ns <dig> and vibs. vp <dig> only associates with ns <dig> and vibs through its interaction with vp <dig> or other btv components. however, vp <dig> is never recruited within the vibs.

the distribution of vp <dig> in ibs alters in the presence of scaffolding protein vp3
to further our understanding of the influence of vp <dig> on vp <dig> assembly, we monitored the distribution pattern of both vp <dig> and vp <dig> in the presence of ns <dig> in bsr cells. ns <dig> expressing cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing vp <dig> and vp <dig> and processed for immunostaining as described in the materials and methods. both vp <dig> and vp <dig> were labeled with specific antibodies . the distribution of vp <dig> altered dramatically when co-expressed with vp <dig> in the ns <dig> expressing cells . both vp <dig> and vp <dig> were perfectly co-localized in a pattern that closely resembled the pattern of ns <dig> ibs in the cytoplasm. the overall size of these ibs  was larger than that of ns <dig> ibs when ns <dig> was expressed singly or when btv proteins were not associated with ns <dig> ibs . it could be speculated that this is due to the presence of both vp <dig> and vp <dig> in ns <dig> ibs, thus increasing the overall sizes of ns <dig> ibs.

rna transcription takes place in ns <dig> ibs of a btv infected cell
btv positive strand rna directs both protein synthesis and production of minus-strand rna. in btv infected cells the transcriptionally active core particles become rapidly surrounded by vibs upon entry into the cytoplasm  <cit> . since ns <dig> has an affinity for btv transcripts  <cit>  and is likely to be involved in the recruitment of viral transcripts, we sought to examine if the viral transcripts could be identified within the vibs. btv infected cells were treated with actinomycin d, to arrest the host replication and transcription, followed by transfection with brutp as described in materials and methods. we chose  <dig> h p.i for brutp transfection since the formation of vibs in btv infected cell was maximal between  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. after fixation with formaldehyde newly made rna was visualized by staining with anti-brdu antibody and the ns <dig> inclusions were located using anti-ns <dig> polyclonal antibody. the brdu-labeled rna transcripts were distributed throughout the ns <dig> ibs suggesting that these are the likely sites for rna replication . btv infected bsr cells in the absence of brutp were used as control and no brdu signal was detected in these cells upon labeling with anti-brutp antibody, thus confirming its specificity .

inducible expression of truncated ns <dig> derivatives in mammalian cells
upon confirmation of the fact that btv core proteins, particles and transcripts were closely associated with ns <dig> and ibs formed by ns <dig>  we extended our study to examine the role of ns <dig> in overall virus replication. to this end, we sought to obtain dominant negative mutants of ns <dig> in order to perturb the ns <dig> function. deletion mutants of ns <dig> protein were designed in four overlapping fragments, residues 1â <dig> , 116â <dig> , 1â <dig> , and 238â <dig>  . bsr cell lines expressing each fragment constitutively were generated as described for the full-length ns <dig>  the constitutive expression of each ns <dig> mutant fragment was determined by pulse labeling with 35s-methionine/cysteine and the labeled protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-ns <dig> btv polyclonal antibody. the expression levels of each the truncated ns <dig> fragments when examined by sds-page was much lower than that of the full-length ns <dig> . in addition to the predicted molecular weight fragment of 1â <dig> , an additional smaller breakdown product was also precipitated. to examine the capability of these ns <dig> fragments to produce ibs, cells expressing each ns <dig> truncation were labeled with the ns <dig> antibody and the distribution of ibs visualized by fluorescence microscopy. none of the truncated versions of ns <dig> could form the large ibs characteristic of btv infection or like that of full-length ns <dig> . instead the truncated ns <dig> proteins were found spread throughout the cell cytoplasm in a diffuse manner except Îns2- <dig>  which exhibited some granular staining pattern . in all cases, the dispersed distribution of ns <dig> antigen completely disappeared in the presence of  <dig> Î¼g/ml doxycycline indicating the absence of ns <dig> protein synthesis in the presence of the drug . these results suggest that the capability to form ib is a function of the complete ns <dig> protein. expression levels of the truncated ns <dig> proteins in Îns2- <dig> and Îns2- <dig> cell lines were found to be variable in the individual cells as indicated by the arrow . due to this heterogeneity in protein expression these two cell lines were not used in subsequent experiments.

inhibitory effects of ns <dig> fragments on btv infection
to investigate the effect of ns <dig> deletion mutants, cell line expressing full-length wt-ns <dig>  Îns2- <dig> or Îns2- <dig> were infected with btv and the level of infectious virus production in each case was monitored by plaque assay . the overall yield of infectious btv particles, isolated from the culture media and the infected cell lysates of induced wt-ns <dig>  was very similar to that of btv infected normal bsr cells or uninduced cells , as was the relative proportions of virus present in the cell-associated and supernatant fractions. however, when cell lines expressing the truncated ns <dig> were infected with btv, both cell lines showed a reduced overall titre suggesting a trans-dominant inhibitory effect on virus replication. moreover, in the case of Îns2- <dig>  the overall titre was marginally reduced and the ratio of secreted to cell-associated virus titre increased about  <dig> fold, while cell lines expressing Îns2- <dig> appeared to more powerfully inhibit overall virus replication.

to investigate this observation further, a pulse-chase analysis of each cell line was performed at  <dig> h p.i with btv to assess the rate of virus movement through the cells. a  <dig> h labeling pulse was chased for  <dig> min,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h and at each time point both cell lysates and extra-cellular media were collected and btv antigens identified by immunoprecipitation. compared to the normal viral release as observed in wt-ns <dig> , virus presence in the extra-cellular media of the Îns2- <dig>  cells was identifiable at very early time points . the kinetics of virus release from Îns2- <dig> cells  resembled that of the full-length ns <dig> cell line , although the overall titre was considerably reduced .

expression of only the rna binding amino-terminal region of ns <dig> alters the btv egress from the infected cell
to examine further the effect of amino and carboxyl terminus truncation on ib formation and on btv release, we examined each cell line following infection with btv by em. negative staining of thin sections of bsr cells infected with btv for  <dig> h prior to processing shows particulate structures with dimension ~ <dig> nm . these structures were similar to btv core particles and appeared to be surrounded by vibs . often these particles appeared to be released from the vibs in a cluster . particles with similar sizes were also seen within the vibs of the wt-ns <dig> cells that were infected with btv . in contrast to the full-length ns <dig> expressing cells or normal bsr cells, cells expressing Îns2- <dig> showed release of particles resembling the btv virion from the cell membrane, but very few, if any large vibs . thus, the normal virus egress pathway in mammalian cells was altered drastically due to the absence of ibs. although in case of cells expressing Îns2- <dig>  small granular bodies were observed, very few virus particles could be detected in the infected cells .

discussion
the interaction of viral proteins and the recruitment of all the necessary components for de novo genomic rna synthesis and viral core assembly have only recently begun to be illuminated. reports from different laboratories, including this one, have shown that the different non structural proteins of diverse members of the reoviridae family are involved in the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that resemble viral ibs  <cit> . despite the lack of sequence homology, functional analysis of rotavirus nsp <dig>  and reovirus protein Ïns  suggests that they may be homologues of btv ns <dig> as all three proteins have been implicated in viral genome replication and/or packaging  <cit> . direct analysis of infected cells is limited by the fact that all viral proteins are constantly present and the distinction between proteins that are free in the cytoplasm or partially inclusion associated is difficult. in this study we created cell lines constitutively expressing btv ns <dig> proteins, the main determinant of the viral inclusion formation, by using the tet-off inducible expression system, specifically to examine the association of ns <dig> with btv structural proteins in the absence of the complete viral replication-cycle. it is known that btv structural proteins have inherent affinities for each other as single, double or triple layered capsids can assemble in insect cells in the absence of ns <dig> or vib formation  <cit> . however, in that system the concentration of structural proteins is very high and may obviate the need for facilitating molecules. a very similar phenomenon is observed with the assembly and release of retroviral capsids which proceeds following baculovirus expression without the p <dig> resident ptap domain required for physiologically relevant assembly  <cit> . thus, a plausible role for the vibs in virus infected cells might be to coordinate the formation of infectious particles by the recruitment of all the essential structural components followed by the sequential packaging of viral genomes.

inducible cells expressing ns <dig> were used to investigate which structural proteins associate with ns <dig> ibs in the absence of other btv components. from this analysis it was clear that when the major btv structural proteins were co-expressed singly with ns <dig>  only the inner core protein vp <dig> co-localized with ns <dig> ibs. neither vp <dig> nor vp <dig> protein was found to be associated with ib structures. however, when vp <dig> was expressed in the presence of vp <dig>  vp <dig> was readily moved into the ns <dig> ibs. thus, vp <dig> interacts spontaneously with vp <dig> to generate the core and assembly occurs predominantly at the site of vp <dig> accretion with ns <dig>  the data also support our earlier findings which showed that vp <dig> and the three minor proteins that form the btv transcription complex were always seen together with ns <dig> ibs when cells were transfected with ns <dig> plasmids or infected with btv  <cit> . together with our previous report and this current study we suggest that ns <dig> ibs recruit newly synthesized vp <dig> and the minor protein enzyme complex, soon after synthesis, in order to enucleate the essential components for virus replication. this model was further substantiated by demonstrating that the newly synthesized btv transcripts were also localized within the ns <dig> ibs. this data is consistent with the data described recently which has shown that ns <dig> has specific binding affinity for btv transcripts  <cit> . it seems therefore likely that ns <dig> ibs are the site where the co-assembly of vp <dig>  the polymerase complex and plus strand btv rna species takes place. studies of vp <dig> assembly onto the vp <dig> subcore have suggested that enshrouding begins at a number of discrete sites on the vp <dig> shell rather than one unique site  <cit> . thus, either during subcore assembly or after completion of subcore formation, vp <dig> 't' trimers begin to attach to the vp <dig> subcore. the core particle subsequently forms a stable structure ready to release from the vibs. during btv infection subcore-like and core-like particles have been observed in ibs by scanning electron microscopy  <cit> . neither outer virion structural protein, vp <dig> or vp <dig>  have affinity for ibs and therefore progeny core particles produced in the vibs most likely move to periphery of the vib to be coated by the outer capsid proteins  <cit> . interestingly, vp <dig> has been shown to be associated with the cell cytoskeleton  <cit> . the eukaryotic cytoskeleton network undergoes considerable rearrangement following infection by certain viruses such as african swine fever virus   <cit> , vaccinia virus  <cit>  and reovirus  <cit> .

some reovirus strains show selective and temporally regulated association of the cytoskeleton with the assembly site  <cit> , and most mammalian reovirus strains form microtubule associated filamentous factories  <cit> . by contrast, visualization of btv infected or ns <dig> expressing cells, by immunofluorescence, revealed that vibs and ns <dig> ibs are globular cytoplasmic inclusions and are not associated with cytoskeleton. most conclusively, the treatment of cells with a mt-depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, clearly indicated that there was no effect of the drug on vibs formation in the cytoplasm.

to substantiate further the importance of ns <dig> and ibs in btv replication, we generated cell lines expressing ns <dig> fragments. two cell lines, one expressing amino terminal fragment and other carboxyl terminal fragment of ns <dig> fragments were utilized. the amino terminal  <dig> residues in ns <dig> have already been shown to contain the predominant rna binding domain of the protein and thus may delineate functional boundaries within ns <dig>  <cit> . neither fragment formed complete ibs alone but our data suggest that cells expressing the c-terminal fragment of ns <dig>  were capable of limited ns <dig> antigen aggregation . protein-protein interactions via the c terminal portion of ns <dig> would be consistent with rna interactions predominantly via the n-terminal  <dig> residues  <cit> . when the cell lines expressing wt-ns <dig> were infected with btv, the constitutive expression of the complete molecule did not have a significant effect on virus yield nor on the distribution of virions between the cell and supernatant. however, btv infection of the two cell lines expressing ns <dig> fragments lead to a marked reduction in overall virus yield possibly because both fragments act as dominant negatives through an interaction with the full-length virally expressed ns <dig>  in addition, the relative proportion of virus released from the cell and the kinetics of release were altered. as revealed by pulse-chase and em of infected cells, Îns2- <dig> cell line expressing the rna binding region of ns <dig> severely crippled the ability of ns <dig> to form ibs and promoted accelerated trafficking of the progeny virus particles. it is known from our previous study that the interaction between rna and ns <dig> plays a role in the stable oligomerisation of ns <dig>  <cit> . hence, it can be hypothesized that perhaps Îns2- <dig> competes with the rna binding activity of full-length ns <dig> and thereby perturbs the stability of vibs which requires ns2-rna interactions. in the case of Îns2- <dig>  although the expression of small granular bodies could be observed, they were morphologically different to the functional inclusions formed by full-length ns <dig>  nevertheless, these small structures have the ability to interact with monomeric ns <dig> thereby interfering with the function of vibs in virus replication. thus, both mutants have the ability to perturb the normal virus replication and trafficking although the exact molecular basis behind these phenomena is not yet understood.

CONCLUSIONS
the ibs or virosomes produced in btv infected cells have been the subject of some debate, split broadly between them being integral to virus replication and assembly or being the inadvertent consequence of another primary function  <cit> . our work shows that their previously described complexity  is a result of their key role in the recruitment of viral components. their make-up is dependent only on a full-length ns <dig> with the c terminus of the protein being the major functional domain involved. ns <dig> has an innate propensity to interact with vp <dig>  the inner core protein and through this has the ability to interact with vp <dig>  the surface core protein. rna binding by the amino terminal domain would complete the requirements for core formation and completed cores, now protected from the possibility of inducing an interferon response, would then be free to acquire the outer layers  outside the ib structures. the data implies that replication and assembly are coordinated events in the ibs. the definition of the precise order of events required for completing btv assembly and release, with the accompanying increased possibilities for prevention and control, remains an unfinished but achievable goal.
