BACKGROUND
paleoclimatic events have been put forward as one of the main mechanisms causing speciations and extinctions of evolutionary lineages . the differences in ecology and life history of taxa, however, often result in differential species-specific responses to similar climatic events  and a simple explanation describing speciation processes hardly exists. for parasitic taxa the situation is further perplexed by complex life cycles, host biogeography, and the level of parasite-host associations . although some progress has been made regarding this topic  more quantifiable data are needed to make more accurate predictions on for example the factors affecting range expansions and connectivity among populations. for many parasitic taxa, this is desperately needed from a disease ecology perspective  <cit> .

in southern africa, several phylogeographic studies have been performed on small vertebrate taxa . from these studies, paleoclimatic changes are once again suggested as one of the main drivers of evolution. congruent phylogeographic patterns among lizards, rodents, shrews and elephant shrews also suggested the existence of vicariant biogeographic barriers in the region . of particular relevance to the present study is the support for regional vicariance found in rhabdomys  <cit> , myosorex  <cit> , otomys  <cit>  and micaelamys  <cit> . these small mammals show distinct genetic clades that can be associated with the xeric western succulent biomes and the more mesic eastern predominantly grassland biome of southern africa . in addition, rhabdomys, myosorex and micaelamys show differentiation to a larger or lesser extent between the winter rainfall zone and the aseasonal rainfall zone in the cape floristic region . from these studies it is evident that the diversification of small mammals in the region is driven by complex interactions between life history, climate and topographic barriers.fig.  <dig> map of sampling localities. map indicating a localities sampled with their respective codes indicated as in table  <dig>  the vicariant breaks in south africa  winter and aseasonal rainfall break and  xeric and mesic biomes are indicated by white dashed lines, b the mapped distribution of l. agrippinae and c

the effect of vicariant barriers on the evolution of parasites occurring in southern africa is virtually unknown. an exception to this is provided by  <cit> , who recently indicated partial congruence in spatial genetic structure between rhabdomys and its species specific lice, polyplax. distinct genetic clades in the parasites and in the hosts supported the documented mesic eastern and xeric western divide in the subregion . co-evolution analyses, however, failed to support a strong signal of geographic co-differentiation between parasite and host and the authors suggested that the resultant pattern is due to the synergistic effects of parasite traits , host-related factors  and the biogeography  of the region  <cit> . to expand on these findings, we here present phylogeographic data on two generalist flea species occurring on rhabdomys and other small mammal species in southern africa.

individual flea species are normally adapted to utilize a variety of hosts in the environment and are all obligatory blood feeders of endothermic vertebrates  <cit> . the life cycle consists of four stages  and fleas are dependent on the nest environments of the hosts to variable extent  <cit> . immatures develop entirely in the off-host environment while adult stages have to spend some time on the host to obtain a blood meal. the length of time that is spent on the host, however, varies between flea taxa . this observation has provided an opportunity to coarsely classify fleas according to their microhabitat preference as either a “fur”  or a “nest” flea . these differences can have profound effects on the ability of the flea species to disperse over the landscape and we therefore predict that fur fleas will show more phylogeographic congruence with the host/s  and nest fleas will show more restricted gene flow across the landscape .

to test the hypothesis that fleas with different levels of host association will differ in spatial genetic structure, the fur flea, listropsylla agrippinae, and the nest flea, chiastopsylla rossi  <cit>  were selected. both l. agrippinae and c. rossi occur widespread throughout southern africa   <cit>  and span at least two well documented vicariant biogeographic barriers in the region . apart from differences in the duration of time adults spend on the host, the two species also differ in the level of host specificity . listropsylla agrippinae has two principle host taxa  whereas c. rossi has at least four main host taxa  documented  <cit> . it has been suggested that host specificity may influence the level of intraspecific genetic divergences since more generalist parasite species will show a higher level of intraspecific genetic variation enabling them to infest a broader host range . furthermore, microhabitat preference  is not always related to host specificity, meaning that fleas may differ in host specificity irrespective of microhabitat preference . if niche breath and time spent on the host affect 1) genetic diversity of the parasite and 2) congruence in phylogeographic structure between parasites and hosts , we predict that l. agrippinae, when compared to c. rossi, will show lower levels of intraspecific genetic diversity and also more similarities to the vicariant patterns of the hosts they infest. genetic distances among individuals from different sampling sites are expected to be higher for the nest flea, c. rossi, when compared to the fur flea, l. agrippinae, since the latter can utilize the host for dispersion. by considering the interplay between life history and geography, the present study should add valuable information needed to explain some of the evolutionary processes that shape ectoparasite distribution and diversity.

RESULTS
parasite prevalence and distribution
both r. pumilio and r. dilectus were trapped at a contact zone, fort beaufort , and represent the only locality where more than one rhabdomys species was trapped . listropsylla agrippinae were recorded at lower prevalence at the majority of localities when compared to c. rossi . listropsylla agrippinae was found on six host species and was most prevalent on r. intermedius  . chiastopsylla rossi was found on nine host species, but most prevalent on r. intermedius  and o. irroratus  compared to the other  <dig> host taxa . individuals selected for sequencing were representative of the various host species trapped at each locality .fig.  <dig> barplots of number of individuals sequenced and prevalence. the number of individuals sequenced and prevalence of a

phylogeographic analyses
listropsylla agrippinae
tcs statistical parsimony analysis based on the mitochondrial coii data showed two distinct clusters  that could not be connected within the 95 % confidence interval. these two clusters are separated by an average corrected mtdna sequence divergence of  <dig>  %  and this large differentiation is further supported by the neighbor-net tree . the clusters correspond to the xeric western  and eastern mesic  zones of the country. the baps analysis corroborated the two clusters detected by tcs and the neighbor-net tree, and also indicate some additional substructure within cluster l <dig>  . these two subclusters loosely correspond to the winter and aseasonal rainfall divide . the spatial genetic patterns were less pronounced when the nuclear ef1-α data is compared to the mitochondrial dna network . there is some evidence for regional clustering as indicated by the grouping of similarly shaded colors in the parsimony network and neighbor-net tree  but more importantly, however, the most common dna allele is shared between the far eastern and far western side of the sampling distribution. mantel tests for mitochondrial coii data indicated that there were weak isolation by distance when calculated for all localities  and when calculated for each cluster l <dig>  and l <dig>  separately. the time of divergence between the two main clusters within l. agrippinae date back to the late miocene which was estimated to be  <dig>  ma .fig.  <dig>

genetic landscape interpolation surface plots for the coii data indicated that there were marked differences between some sampling localities when the distribution of genetic diversity found at each is compared across the landscape . the graphical representation suggests that the area of greatest genetic diversity was found in the contact zone close to the ‘bedford gap’ . fixation index values of mitochondrial coii for l. agrippinae were significant at all levels and the highest level of differentiation was recovered among subclusters  . fixation index values of nuclear ef1-α for l. agrippinae were significant at all levels but in this instance the highest level of variation was recovered within localities  . pairwise Φst values among sampling localities showed that the majority of sampling sites are significantly differentiated from each other for both the nuclear and mtdna data .fig.  <dig> genetic landscape interpolation plots. genetic landscape interpolation plot for total distribution of a

chiastopsylla rossi
tcs analysis based on mitochondrial coii data showed a remarkably different genetic pattern for c. rossi when compared to l. agrippinae. the majority of the localities sampled are characterized by unique divergent haplotypes , and although two distinct genetic clusters separated by an average sequence divergence of  <dig>  %  were also obtained for this species , it was not congruent with vicariant host patterns . instead, limited haplotype sharing was evident among distant sampling sites and the majority of populations were characterized by unique/closely related locality specific haplotypes . the lack of clear geographic structure is further supported by the neighbor-net tree  and moreover by the baps analyses suggesting at least six distinct subclusters present within c. rossi . the spatial genetic pattern of the nuclear ef1-α network and the neighbor-net tree suggest more lineage sharing across the landscape when compared to the mitochondrial dna coii data . similarly to l. agrippinae, the nuclear data also indicate some level of population differentiation . the nuclear tcs analyses suggest a distinct clade comprising individuals from kp, mn and af and this assemblage is supported as one of the six mtdna baps subclusters. this subcluster is mainly found in the north eastern part of south africa, and although it may have some biological meaning, the neighbor-net analysis  show that comparatively the level of differentiation is low. the majority of the subclusters identified by the mtdna and ndna data do not corresponded to any of the known biogeographic breaks previously documented for the majority of the host species and in fact are scattered across the landscape . mantel tests indicated that there were virtually no isolation by distance within c. rossi when calculated for all localities .fig.  <dig>

the scattered distribution coupled to high inter-populational genetic variation in c. rossi is supported when the genetic landscape surface plot is considered. in contrast to l. agrippinae, c. rossi show several genetic discontinuities  throughout the total sampling distribution . fixation index values of the mitochondrial coii for c. rossi were significant at all levels and the highest level of differentiation was recovered among subclusters . the highest level of differentiation for the ef1-α was recovered within localities . pairwise Φst values for the mitochondrial and nuclear data also showed significant differentiation among the majority of sampling localities and the highest level of differentiation was again generally detected between kp, mn and af and the remainder of the populations .

discussion
parasites are generally considered to have a high mutation rate, small effective population size and a limited dispersal ability. from this, it is predicted that pronounced spatial genetic structuring will be evident among sampling sites due to reduced gene flow and increased genetic drift . overall, the results presented for the two generalist parasite species in this study conform to these suggestions. most of the geographically distinct populations sampled show significant differentiation among sampling sites at both the mtdna and ndna level  a scenario attributed to reduced gene flow across the landscape .table  <dig>

pairwise Φst values among c. rossi sampled localities for mitochondrial dna  below and nuclear intron  above the diagonal. significant values  are highlighted in bold. 



fleas are considered generalist parasites and are thus predicted to show very little phylogeographic congruence with host genetic structure  <cit> . the present study provides the first evidence for the converse and, by making use of a comparative approach between two species, highlights the importance of the level of association between parasite and host in shaping genetic diversity across the landscape. the fur flea  which seems to have a narrower niche breath   <cit> , and spend longer time periods on the host, show three distinct mtdna phylogeographic clades which are markedly congruent to the previously published regional vicariant biogeographic regions based on the patterns obtained in rhabdomys  <cit> , micaelamys  <cit> , otomys  <cit>  and myosorex  <cit>  . further support for the notion that the large scale dispersal of l. agrippinae is closely dependent on host movement can be obtained from the observation that the 95 % confidence interval of the time of divergence between the two major clades found in l. agrippinae  corresponds reasonably well with the timing of the divergence of the majority of rodent host lineages in the region  <cit> . in contrast, the more host opportunistic nest flea  show, in agreement with other phylogeographic studies on fleas  <cit> , virtually no congruence in phylogeographic patterns between host and parasite. the distinct clustering of c. rossi fleas sampled in the north east of the country  is not clearly depicted by longer branches in the neighbor-net analyses  and also not congruent with well documented biogeographic provinces. we argue that although this finding is interesting, it may simply be an artefact of the sampling distances between the various sampling sites.

the documented contact zone between r. pumilio and r. dilectus at fort beaufort  provides an interesting scenario to further explore host specificity among the two flea species . in the zone of contact, the two rhabdomys species harbored distinct l. agrippinae mtdna lineages represented by l <dig>  and l <dig> . in sharp contrast, the host opportunistic c. rossi show a high level of haplotype sharing among closely related localities in the same region . rhabdomys species is considered the principle hosts of l. agrippinae and m. unisulcatus is considered to be an auxiliary host, whereas c. rossi seems to have a larger host range  <cit> . albeit based on a very small sample size, the tighter host association displayed by l. agrippinae might explain why we found distinct mtdna lineages for l. agrippinae on rhabdomys spp., but no differentiation in c. rossi in the contact zone.

when the intraspecific phylogeographic structures of l. agrippinae and c. rossi are compared to each other some more discrepancies are evident. first, our data provide additional support for the hypothesis that more generalist parasites will show higher levels of genetic diversity when compared to more specific parasites . the connectivity among sampling sites is also markedly different between the two flea species. the more host specific fur flea l. agrippinae, show lower inter-populational divergence within clades  when compared to the more host opportunistic nest flea, c. rossi . the same trend is evident when the ndna data are considered . the higher level of inter-populational divergences of c. rossi are best reflected by the large number of site changes among locality specific haplotypes  and the numerous peaks on the landscape interpolation plots . these findings could be interpreted to be the direct result of differences in the dispersal abilities of the two fleas and can best be ascribed to differences in host association. both parasites show isolation by distance but in both cases the correlation is extremely weak . in the case of the host specific fur flea, l. agrippinae, host movement provide hitchhiking possibilities within clades resulting in a higher level of connectivity among sampling sites. in the host opportunistic nest flea, c. rossi, the parasite has less opportunity to spread via host movement, resulting in a pattern of distantly related haplotypes at most sites. at specific geographic sites, it is possible that populations experience high levels of genetic drift that is homogenizing the locality specific signals . long distance dispersals of the host opportunistic nest flea studied herein is a rare event and happen in a random way utilizing a wide niche breath , culminating in a pattern where some shared haplotypes are found on opposite ends of the geographic scale  and geographically distant localities .

from our study it was also evident that l. agrippinae occurred at a lower prevalence than c. rossi overall and the pattern was also apparent at most localities where the distribution of the two species overlap. the same trend in prevalence and abundance for l. agrippinae and c. rossi was recorded in previous studies in south africa  <cit> . the two flea species differ in terms of body length with l. agrippinae being larger  compared to c. rossi  . studies on free-living taxa and more recently on ectoparasitic mites of small mammals recorded a negative relationship between body size and abundance . in the latter study it was suggested that the pattern may be due to higher host-induced mortality  associated with larger bodied ectoparasites  <cit> . listropsylla agrippinae is almost twice the size of c. rossi and it is possible that host grooming  resulted in lower l. agrippinae prevalence. interestingly, in the present study the difference in body size between the two flea species seem to support their level of host specificity. studies on microbes and diatoms and more recently on ectoparasitic mites recorded a negative relationship between body size and niche breadth . it appears that smaller bodied species are more adaptable to environmental fluctuations which results in a larger niche breath or in the case of parasites a larger host range. this is in contrast to larger species that have a smaller niche breath/host range due to narrower tolerance levels .

if prevalence is positively correlated to abundance in fleas  <cit> , then it could be argued that the higher abundance  of the more host opportunistic nest flea, c. rossi, on the hosts will facilitate dispersal among sampling sites. this pattern is however contrary to what we found in the present study where c. rossi is more structured between sampling sites when compared to l. agrippinae. one possible explanation for this may relate to differences in the effective population sizes between the two flea species. a higher genetic diversity, as found in c. rossi, is expected for populations with larger effective population sizes  <cit>  and it is furthermore reasonable to predict that nest fleas will predominantly have higher abundances in the nests of their hosts  <cit> . given the nest bound nature of c. rossi, the number of dispersing individuals on the hosts may thus not be large enough to overcome the effects of drift when introduced into the nests of the hosts elsewhere . in contrast, for l. agrippinae, the comparatively lower effective population sizes can facilitate the signature of more haplotype sharing among localities within clades.

CONCLUSIONS
in the light of re-emerging flea borne diseases worldwide, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in shaping flea distribution and movement  <cit> . from our study it is evident that host association  plays an important role in flea dispersal and subsequent gene flow within and between geographic locations. this study also provides the first evidence of congruent phylogeographic vicariant patterns between a generalist parasitic flea and its hosts. unfortunately our conclusions are based on a single study comprising two distinct life histories. more parasite taxa and gene fragments needs to be evaluated in order to formulate stronger hypotheses in this regard.
