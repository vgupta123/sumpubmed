BACKGROUND
methionine is an essential amino acid in mammalian cells, although most bacteria, fungi and plants synthesize this amino acid de novo from aspartate  <cit> . methionine participates in protein biosynthesis both as an initial amino acid and as one of the basic building blocks  <cit> . in escherichia coli, the first enzyme in the methionine biosynthesis pathway, homoserine o-succinyltransferase   <cit> , is extremely sensitive to many stress conditions   <cit> . at temperatures higher than 25°c, meta activity is reduced, and the protein tends to unfold, resulting in a methionine limitation in e. coli growth  <cit> . meta reversibly unfolds at temperatures approaching 42°c and is a substrate for the atp-dependent proteases lon, clpp/x and hslvu  <cit> . at temperatures of 44°c and higher, meta completely aggregates and is no longer found in the soluble protein fraction, thus limiting growth  <cit> . the chemical chaperone trimethylamine oxide reduces insoluble meta accumulation and improves e. coli growth at elevated temperatures  <cit> . it has been suggested that meta could be classified as a class iii substrate for chaperones because this molecule is extremely prone to aggregation  <cit> .

despite the importance of meta in e. coli growth, little information exists on the amino acid residues involved in the inherent instability of meta. the sensitivity of meta to multiple stress conditions suggests that this enzyme might be a type of ‘metabolic fuse’ for the detection of unfavorable growth conditions  <cit> . previously, we used random mutagenesis of meta to improve e. coli growth at elevated temperatures  <cit> . mutations that resulted in the amino acid substitutions i229t and n267d enabled the e. coli strain we to grow at higher temperatures and increased the ability of the strain to tolerate acidic conditions. in this study, we extended our stabilization studies using a computer-based design and consensus approach  <cit>  to identify additional mutations that might stabilize the inherently unstable meta enzyme. to achieve pronounced thermal stabilization, we combined several single substitutions in a multiple mutant, as the thermo-stabilization effects of individual mutations in many cases were independent and nearly additive  <cit> . here, we describe the successful application of the consensus concept approach and the i-mutant <dig>  modeling tool  <cit>  to design stabilized meta mutants. the consensus concept approach for engineering thermally stable proteins is based on an idea that by multiple sequence alignment of the homologous counterparts from mesophiles and thermophiles, the nonconsensus amino acid might be determined and substituted with the respective consensus amino acid, contributing to the protein stability  <cit> . i-mutant <dig>  is a support vector machine-based web server for the automatic prediction of protein stability changes with single-site mutations .

four substitutions, q96k, i124l, i229y and f247y, improved the growth of the e. coli we strain at elevated temperatures. unexpectedly, the meta mutants i124y and i229y, which conferred higher growth rates at 44°c, displayed melting temperatures similar to that of the native enzyme but exhibited improved in vivo stability. the stabilized meta mutant enzymes at least partially recovered the growth defects of mutant e. coli strains with deletions of either atp-dependent proteases or the dnak chaperone. these results suggest that the growth defects of Δdnak or protease-deficient mutants primarily reflect malfunctioning meta at 37°c, a standard physiological temperature. consistently, the addition of methionine recovered the temperature-dependent growth defects of these mutants.

RESULTS
mutant metas enable e. coli growth at elevated temperatures
previously, we identified two amino acid substitutions, i229t and n267d, which conferred stability to the meta protein  <cit> . to obtain additional stable meta mutants, we employed a multiple alignment approach and identified eight amino acid residues present in all thermophilic metas but absent in e. coli meta . the meta mutations that resulted in the corresponding amino acid substitutions q96k, l110v, i124l, r160l, a195t, a200e, d218g and f247y were integrated into the e. coli jw <dig>  chromosome to yield the strains k <dig>  v <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  t <dig>  e <dig>  g <dig> and y <dig>  respectively. among the constructed strains, three mutants, k <dig>  l <dig> and y <dig>  demonstrated accelerated growth at 44°c in m <dig> glucose medium  compared with the control strain we, which harbored the wild-type meta gene from the e. coli k- <dig> strain w <dig>  <cit> .

using the i-mutant <dig>  modeling tool  <cit>  for protein stability prediction, the i229y mutation was predicted to improve meta stability and accelerate growth at 44°c . to confirm the enhanced thermo-tolerant growth of the l <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> mutants, the serially diluted cultures were incubated on solid m <dig> glucose plates at 44°c . the viability of the mutant strains was increased by at least one to two orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type strain . supplementation of the culture medium with l-methionine stimulated the growth of the wild-type and the mutant strains at 44°c to the same extent, thus abolishing the differences between the wild-type and mutant strains . the mutant strains l <dig> and y <dig>  which displayed the higher growth rates at 44°c , were selected for further analysis.

to test the combinatorial effects of the mutations, we constructed mutant strains harboring i124l-i229y and i124l-i229y-n267d substitutions in the meta enzyme . the n267d substitution conferring an increased thermal stability to the meta enzyme has been previously described  <cit> . the double ly and triple lyd mutant strains were cultured at 45°c in m <dig> glucose medium and compared with single mutants l <dig> and y <dig> and the wild-type strain we . the temperature 45°c was chosen because no significant differences between the strains harboring single and multiple mutated meta enzymes were detected at 44°c . the wild-type strain did not grow at 45°c . the double ly and triple lyd mutants grew faster than the single mutant strains l <dig> and y <dig>  which had specific growth rates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig> versus  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig>  respectively. the highest growth rate at 45°c was observed in the lyd strain , in which the effects of the meta enzyme were combined the maximal number of the stabilizing mutations. however, the mutant lyd still grew slower than in the presence of l-methionine . this result might reflect the presence of another thermolabile protein in the methionine biosynthetic pathway. previously, mogk et al. <cit>  showed that mete, which catalyzes the last step in methionine biosynthesis, was also thermally sensitive and tended to form aggregates at a 45°c heat shock.

mutant metas enabling e. coli growth at higher temperatures did not display an increased thermal transition midpoint
to determine whether the accelerated growth observed at 44°c for the single mutant meta strains is due to increased thermal stability of meta, the protein melting temperature  was measured using differential scanning calorimetry . the wild-type and mutant meta enzymes containing a c-terminal six-histidine tag were purified as described in the methods section. the tm of the wild-type meta was  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c , and the tms of the stabilized meta proteins were slightly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme .

*the errors associated with the data were <2% for ∆h and ∆hv. the calorimetric heat  is the heat change per mole of enzyme. the van’t hoff heat  is the heat change per cooperative unit. the ratio ∆h/∆hv is a measure of the number of thermally transited cooperative units per mole of enzyme. all measurements were performed in triplicate.

because the stabilized mutants displayed tm values similar to the native enzyme, we hypothesized that the catalytic activity was enhanced in the meta mutants. no difference was observed in the kcat and km values for succinyl-coa between the stabilized meta mutants and native meta enzyme, whereas the km for l-homoserine was reduced  <dig> -fold in the i124l mutant compared with the wild-type meta . this finding is consistent with the slight increase in kcat/km of 58% compared with the native enzyme. thus, the stabilizing mutations had little to no effect on the catalytic activity of the meta enzyme.

meta mutant enzymes exhibit reduced aggregation at an elevated temperature  in vitro and in vivo
native meta was previously reported to become completely aggregated in vitro at temperatures of 44°c and higher  <cit> . to examine the aggregation-prone behavior of native and stabilized metas, we generated in vitro aggregates of the purified proteins as described in the methods section. the native meta enzyme was completely aggregated after heating at 45°c for 30 min . in contrast, the engineered i124l and i229y mutant metas demonstrated a higher level of aggregation resistance; only 73% of i124l and 66% of i229y were insoluble .

in addition, we examined the level of soluble meta enzymes in vivo after heat shock at 45°c for 30 min . the amount of the native meta protein in the soluble fraction decreased to 52% following heat shock, whereas the relative amounts of soluble meta i124l and i229y mutants were 76% and 68%, respectively. the amount of insoluble native meta protein increased 28-fold after heating, while those of stabilized meta i124l and i229y mutants increased 20- and 17-fold, respectively . these results confirmed the higher resistance of the stabilized i124l and i229y mutant enzymes to aggregation.

meta mutant enzymes are more stable in vivo at normal  and elevated  temperatures
to determine the effects of these mutations on meta stability in vivo, we analyzed the degradation of the mutant and native meta enzymes after blocking protein synthesis using chloramphenicol. the residual meta in the cells was quantified through western blotting as described in the methods section. as shown in figure  <dig>  the i124l and i229l meta mutants were approximately 2-3-fold more stable than native meta, with half-lives  of 87 min  and 107 min  at 37°c and 52 min  and 57 min  at 44°c, respectively; the half-life of the native meta was 36 min at 37°c and 25 min at 44°c.

stabilized metas partially compensate the growth defects of the Δdnak mutants
meta has been suggested to be classified as a class iii substrate for chaperones because this enzyme is extremely prone to aggregation  <cit> . under physiological heat stress conditions, the dnak system is the most effective chaperone for preventing the aggregation of thermolabile proteins  <cit> . thus, the Δdnak <dig> mutant strain displays a slower growth rate at 37°c and no growth at 42°c  <cit> . because meta is one of the most thermolabile proteins, we determined the growth profiles of dnak null mutants expressing stabilized metas. we constructed the we∆dnak, l124∆dnak and y229∆dnak mutant strains and cultured these cells in m <dig> glucose medium at 37°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mutant strain y229∆dnak grew 26% faster than the control strain we∆dnak, with a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for y229∆dnak and  <dig>  h- <dig> for we∆dnak . the mutant strain l124∆dnak grew at the same rate as y229∆dnak. we observed an increased accumulation of insoluble wild-type meta in heat-stressed ∆dnak cells compared with the mutated i124l and i229y enzymes, which had relative amounts of 57% and 33% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively . this finding might partially explain the slower growth of the we∆dnak strain due to an increased aggregation of the wild-type meta compared with the i124l and i229y mutants.

despite an accelerated growth, the y229∆dnak mutant strain did not achieve the same growth rate as the dnak + parental strain , potentially reflecting increased misfolding and the aggregation of other proteins in the absence the dnak chaperone. we also examined the viability of serially diluted we∆dnak and y229∆dnak cultures at 37°c and confirmed the accelerated growth of the stabilized meta mutant y229∆dnak . at 42°c, the non-permissive growth temperature for the ∆dnak mutants, no growth occurred, even in the presence of the stabilized meta mutants .

partial recovery of the impaired growth of protease-null mutants by the stabilized metas
previous findings have revealed that the temperature-dependent unfolding of meta resulted in the proteolysis of this enzyme  <cit> . aggregated meta is degraded by a combination of the atp-dependent cytosolic proteases lon, clppx/pa and hslvu, particularly at higher temperatures  <cit> . because meta is an inherently unstable protein, we reasoned that aggregated metas should be degraded by intracellular proteases and that protease-minus mutant, unable to degrade aggregated metas, would display hampered growth. the stabilized metas displaying higher in vivo stability would improve the growth of e. coli protease-negative mutants. the triple protease-deficient mutants we, l <dig> and y <dig> were constructed and cultured at 42°c in m <dig> glucose-defined medium. kanemori et al. <cit>  demonstrated the temperature-sensitive growth of the triple protease-deficient e. coli mutant ky <dig> at 42°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mutant y <dig> exhibited an increased specific growth rate  of  <dig>  h- <dig> compared with a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for the control strain we. the growth rate of l <dig> was similar to that of y <dig> . these results indicate that the growth defect of the protease-deficient mutant might be a consequence of increased accumulation of the aggregated meta proteins. previously, biran et al. <cit>  showed that the native meta was stabilized in the cells of triple deletion mutant lon, clpp, hslvu. however, these authors did not identify which protein fraction, soluble or insoluble, contained the meta. apparently, an excess of the meta synthesized at elevated temperatures in a proteolysis-minus background leads to the accumulation of insoluble aggregates that are toxic to the cells and inhibit bacterial growth. therefore, we examined the in vivo aggregation of the wild-type and mutated meta enzymes in heat-stressed protease-deficient cells. the relative amounts of meta insoluble aggregates in the stabilized i124l and i229y mutants were reduced to 59% and 44%, respectively, compared with wild-type meta . we assume that the stabilized metas remaining soluble and functionally active relieved the growth inhibition of the protease-negative e. coli mutant.

we also examine whether the stabilized metas affect the viability of protease-deficient strains at an elevated temperature . the mutant y <dig> was at least 10-fold more viable than the control strain we . the same result was observed for the mutant l <dig> . however, despite accelerated growth and increased viability, the protease-deficient mutants harboring the stabilized metas grew slower than the protease-positive strains we and y <dig> . our findings indicate that the growth defect in the protease-null mutant strain is partially due to meta instability.

methionine recovers the growth defect of the e. coli mutants lacking either atp-dependent proteases or the dnak chaperone
because the stabilized meta mutants conferred an increased growth rate to ∆dnak and protease-deficient e. coli mutants at higher temperatures, we expected that methionine supplementation might recover the growth defects of both mutants. thus, we examined the direct effect of l-methionine supplementation on we∆dnak and we growth at 37°c and 42°c, respectively. in the methionine-supplemented medium, the mutants we∆dnak and we grew two- and six-fold faster, respectively, than without l-methionine supplementation . for we∆dnak, the growth rate was  <dig>  h- <dig> with methionine and  <dig>  h- <dig> without methionine. for we, the growth rate was  <dig>  h- <dig> with methionine and  <dig>  h- <dig> without methionine . the spot test confirmed the results obtained with flask-cultivation . l-methionine also stimulates the growth of the control strain we at 37°c and 42°c . however, the we strain demonstrated only a 28% and 44% increase of the specific growth rates at 37°c and 42°c, respectively, in the presence of methionine . these results clearly indicate that an impaired methionine supply underlies the dnak- and protease-null mutant growth defects.

to determine the effect of methionine on the growth of the mutated meta strains, we cultivated the isogenic strains we and we∆dnak and y <dig> and y229∆dnak in the presence of methionine at 37°c . in the methionine- supplemented medium, the ∆dnak mutants grew at equal rates, and only slightly slower growth than the dnak + strains was observed . these findings suggest that a malfunction of the methionine biosynthetic enzymes, including meta, is primarily responsible for the impaired growth of the ∆dnak mutant strains at 37°c. at temperatures higher than 37°c, defects in other factors, such as chromosomal partitioning, extensive filamentation and increased levels of heat-shock protein  biosynthesis, might significantly hamper the growth of the Δdnak mutants, as previously shown for the Δdnak <dig> mutant strain  <cit> .

l-methionine also eliminated the difference in the growth rates between the protease- deficient control we and mutant y <dig> strains  at 42°c . however, the protease-negative mutants grew 25% slower than the parent strains in the presence of l-methionine , potentially reflecting the accumulation of other protein aggregates  <cit> .

a partial complementation of the impaired growth of the ∆dnak and protease-negative strains through stabilized metas indicates that the inherent instability of meta plays a significant role in the growth defects observed in these mutant strains.

discussion
the growth of e. coli strains at elevated temperatures in a defined medium is impaired by the extreme instability of the first enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway, homoserine o-succinyltransferase   <cit> . although the key role of the meta protein in e. coli growth under thermal stress has been known for 40 years  <cit> , it is unclear which residues are involved in the inherent instability of meta. previously, we identified two amino acid substitutions, i229t and n267d, responsible for meta tolerance to both thermal and acid stress  <cit> . in this study, we employed several approaches to design more stable meta proteins. using the consensus concept approach  <cit> , stabilization was achieved through three single amino acid substitutions, q96k, i124l and f247y. we hypothesized that a combination of these amino acid substitutions might significantly increase meta stability compared with the single mutants we identified in the randomly mutated thermotolerant meta- <dig>  <cit> . the new meta mutant enzymes were more resistant to heat-induced aggregation in vitro . the enhanced in vivo stabilities of the meta mutants were also demonstrated through the immunodetection of residual meta protein after blocking protein synthesis . however, the melting temperature, a good indicator of thermal stability  <cit> , was only slightly increased. instead of thermo-stabilization, the mutant metas might experience kinetic stabilization, in which a specific conformation change, which increases the unfolding barrier, ultimately results in slow unfolding rates  <cit> . this assumption is supported by a decreased level of the mutated metas observed in insoluble protein fraction under a temperature shift from 30° to 45°c compared with the native meta protein . if a native protein is thermodynamically unstable and/or functions under stress conditions, then kinetic stabilization could enhance the functional properties of the protein  <cit> . furthermore, improved kinetic stability is tightly associated with protease resistance  <cit> . notably, the meta mutants were more resistant to proteases; in vitro reconstitution experiments confirmed the resistance of the meta mutants to the atp-dependent cytosolic proteases, including lon, clppx/pa and hslvu . previously, the aggregated meta protein was identified as a substrate for intracellular proteases lon, clppx/pa and hslvu  <cit> . biran et al. <cit>  assumed the combinatorial action of these proteases on meta degradation because the protein stabilization was detected in the triple deletion mutant lon, clpp, hslvu but not in any single  or double  deletion mutants.

previous studies have shown that the dnak gene is not essential for growth and protein folding at 30°c but is required at temperatures above 37°c or below 15°c  <cit> . here, we showed that the defective growth of a Δdnak mutant at 37°c can be partially restored using a stabilized meta . this result suggests that the growth defect of the dnak-deficient strain is primarily due to non-functional meta because meta, an inherently unstable protein even at the physiological temperature of 37°c, requires folding assistance from the dnak chaperone system. the stabilized meta mutants also partially restore the growth defects of protease-deficient strains at 42°c . we also examined whether the temperature-sensitive mutations  affecting other cellular processes are suppressed through methionine supplementation at higher temperatures. none of the mutants showed improved growth, indicating that proper methionine supply is a major issue in the growth defects of both a ∆dnak and the triple protease mutants.

taken together, these results suggest that the temperature-dependent growth defects of the Δdnak mutants and protease-deficient strains primarily reflect the malfunction of meta and consequently, the methionine supply. furthermore, the addition of methionine completely corrects the growth defect of the dnak null mutant at 37°c and recovers most of the impaired growth of the protease-deficient strain at 42°c.

to evaluate the conformational changes caused by single-site mutations in the meta protein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a homology model based on the closest meta homolog, homoserine o-succinyltransferase from thermotoga maritima . our model has shown that the stabilizing meta mutations were randomly distributed in different secondary structure elements . stabilization has been shown for these mutants according to the altered free energy of protein folding  . we observed that the highest ΔΔg value was correlated with the maximal melting temperature  for the y <dig> mutant . we also calculated the cavity volume change as a parameter associated with the conformational stability and folding reaction  <cit> . the cavity volumes of all mutants were diminished compared with the native enzyme, with maximal decrease for the i229y substitution . cavities in proteins are a major contributor to low packing densities and reduced stability  <cit> . cavities and surface grooves are also potential sites for the binding of drugs, ligands and other proteins  <cit> . therefore, decreased cavity volumes should lead to higher conformational stability and resistance to aggregation for originally unstable proteins, such as meta. thus, meta might be an inherently unstable protein  <cit>  because it unfolds at room temperature and dramatically loses activity at 30°c or higher  <cit> . due to its increased sensitivity to many stress conditions, including temperature, weak organic acids and oxidative stress  <cit> , meta protein has been suggested to function as a ‘metabolic fuse’ to detect unfavorable growth conditions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we further elucidated the mutations in meta that facilitate faster e. coli growth at elevated temperatures  compared with the wild-type enzyme. stabilized meta proteins partially suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype of both dnak and triple protease deficient mutants. because improving the growth of e. coli at higher temperatures has an immediate application in realizing the bacterial cell factory, this improvement might also facilitate the identification of target genes and proteins, enabling thermotolerance or improved growth at higher operating temperatures  <cit> .
