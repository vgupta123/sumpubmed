BACKGROUND
organisms that undergo sexual reproduction usually develop from the fusion of male and female gametes during the fertilization process. germ cells are the only cells that produce functional gametes and transmit parental genetic information to the progeny. primordial germ cells  are the precursors of germ cells and are specified during the early days of embryonic development in all vertebrate species. the origin, migratory routes, and timing of pgc differentiation into germ cells vary among vertebrate species. in chickens, pgcs emerged initially in cleavage-stage embryos
 <cit> , and then migrated through the hypoblast layer, germinal crescent area, and blood vessels to reach the bilateral embryonic gonads by approximately embryonic day   <dig> 
. after reaching the gonads, pgcs undergo rapid mitotic cell division to increase their population number. finally, pgcs differentiate into oogonia in females and prospermatogonia in males at approximately e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively
 <cit> . chicken pgcs can be easily isolated from the early embryos, and cultured long-term without losing their characteristic features
 <cit> . therefore, chicken pgcs act as an efficient tool for studying the early migration of germ cells, for identifying the germ cell-expressed gene functions, and for the production of transgenic birds
. recently, several reviews were emphasized the very recent progresses of pgc studies in biomedical sciences and animal biotechnology
. early embryonic development, including the pgc lineage, is governed by the action of many genes and proteins. however, previous studies have shown that small non-coding rnas  do not efficiently govern pgcs in vertebrate species. ncrnas are functional rnas but lack coding sequences that can be translated into functional proteins. ncrnas have been described as a broad class of regulatory rna molecules whose functions continue to be characterized in a variety of model organisms and diseases
 <cit> . the classification of ncrnas includes highly abundant and functionally important transfer rnas , ribosomal rnas , small cytoplasmic rna , small nuclear rnas , small nucleolar rnas , micro rnas , small-interfering rnas , and p-element-induced wimpy testis -interacting rnas 
. the sizes of most small ncrnas range between  <dig> and 32 nt in length, but determining the total number of these ncrnas in a genome remains challenging. recently, many high-throughput technologies, including genome-wide association  studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  and rna sequencing , have been developed to examine various aspects of cellular processes, including the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome and interactome
 <cit> . next-generation sequencing  has played an important role in genomic research and has fundamentally changed the nature of genetic experimentation
 <cit> . ngs can be used to detect alternative splice variants using paired ends, as well as to detect relatively short reads or longer reads. in addition, ngs can detect novel classes of ncrnas
 <cit> . in this study, we performed high-throughput ngs followed by standard annotation protocols to identify different types of small ncrnas particularly pirnas in chicken pgcs compared with gonadal stromal cells  and chicken embryonic fibroblasts , in order to verify their biofunctional activity.

RESULTS
next-generation sequencing of small ncrnas
high-throughput ngs was performed in chicken pgcs using the illumina hiseq platform. we maintained stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs as reference samples. standard protocols were then followed to screen the sequencing data and annotate the small ncrnas. raw ngs data were processed to obtain clean reads by removing low-quality reads , short read tags , and adaptor-ligated contaminants. after the cleaning process, the raw data contained  <dig> , <dig> total reads in pgcs,  <dig> , <dig> in stage x blastoderms,  <dig> , <dig> in gscs, and  <dig> , <dig> in cefs. from these total reads, there were  <dig> , <dig> unique reads in pgcs,  <dig>  in stage x blastoderms,  <dig>  in gscs, and  <dig>  in cefs . the statistics of sequencing quality is shown in additional file
1: table s <dig>  all obtained sequence reads were matched with the current release of the chicken genome in the national center for biotechnology information . among the annotated reads, the most abundant total read length was ~22 nt. however, the most abundant length of the unique reads in pgcs was ~26 nt, in contrast to the other test samples . among the annotated reads in pgcs, the majority of unique reads were mapped to repetitive elements , followed by exon, rrna, intron, or trna sequences. in stage x blastoderms, the majority of unique reads were mapped to repetitive elements , followed by exon, rrna, intron, or trna sequences. in gscs, the majority of unique reads were mapped to exons , followed by rrna, repetitive elements, intron, or trna sequences. in cefs, the majority of unique reads were mapped to rrnas , followed by exon, intron, trna, or repetitive element sequences . the remaining unique reads were mapped to snrnas, snornas, and scrnas, while mirnas were found in low frequencies in all test samples . we compared the rpkm  values of all unique reads to identify the upregulated ncrnas in the test samples. based on the 2-fold cutoff value,  <dig>   small ncrnas originating from repeat sequences were upregulated in pgcs. in addition,  <dig>   rrnas were upregulated in pgcs. in stage x blastoderms,  <dig>   upregulated sequences were small ncrnas originating from repeat sequences, and  <dig>   upregulated sequences were rrnas. in gscs,  <dig>   upregulated sequences were rrnas, and  <dig>  upregulated sequences were mirnas. in cefs,  <dig>   upregulated sequences were rrnas, and  <dig>  upregulated sequences were mirnas. in addition, a significant number  of unannotated sequence reads were upregulated in all test samples .table  <dig>

unique small ncrnas that are upregulated in pgcs, stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs


pirnas obtained using protrac software
since the most abundant base pair size  and annotated classification  of unique reads in pgcs were the potential characteristic of pirnas, we performed ab initio predictive analysis using probabilistic tracking and analysis of clusters  software to identify putative pirnas in chicken pgcs compared with stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs. among all annotated and unannotated unique reads, those that met the input criteria were only accepted for analysis using protrac software. the protrac output revealed  <dig>  unique pirnas in pgcs. among the putative pirnas, a large number  were derived from repeat sequences. the second largest number of pirnas  was derived from unannotated sequences. approximately  <dig>  pirnas were derived from intronic genetic sequences, and ~  <dig> pirnas from gene exons. in addition, a small proportion of other ncrnas were identified as pirnas. in stage x blastoderms, protrac output revealed  <dig>  unique pirnas, among which  <dig>  were derived from repeat sequences. in gscs, protrac output revealed  <dig>  unique pirnas, among which  <dig>  were derived from repeat sequences. in cefs, protrac output revealed only  <dig> unique pirnas, and among these pirnas the most abundant were derived from unannotated sequences . in order to cross-validate the putative chicken pirnas, we performed another ab initio predictive analysis using pirnapredictor software with the sequence reads of test samples. the pirnapredictor output revealed more number of unique pirnas in each test sample . the output results of protrac and pirnapredictor were then compared. in this comparison also, a large number of pirnas were derived from repeat sequences in pgcs. the second largest number of pirnas was derived from unannotated sequences . however, the pirnas identified using protrac were only referred in the subsequent analysis in this study.table  <dig>

expression analysis of putative pirnas and pirna-linked genes
we examined the expression of three repeat sequence-linked pirnas  that were upregulated in pgcs  along with cr <dig> using quantitative real-time pcr . the expression of the three repeat sequence-linked pirnas and cr <dig> were enriched in pgcs compared with stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs. however, the expression of the pirnas was several folds higher in pgcs than that of cr <dig> . we then performed qpcr to examine the expression of  <dig> genic-transcript-linked pirnas  that were upregulated in pgcs  along with their  <dig> linked genes, including immunoglobulin-like receptor chir-b <dig> , immunoglobulin-like receptor chir-ab <dig> , plasmolipin , myosin ia , solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> , lectin-like protein, type ii transmembrane protein , rap2b, member of ras oncogene family , low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein  <dig>  apolipoprotein e receptor , vitamin d <dig> receptor , myosin, heavy chain 1e , zinc finger protein  <dig> , regucalcin , forkhead box d <dig> , and ras association  domain family member  <dig> , respectively . as expected, all genic-transcript-linked pirnas and their linked genes were highly expressed in pgcs compared with stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs.figure  <dig>

functional validation of pirna-linked genes
since the expression of the identified pirnas and their linked genes were higher in germ cells than in other test samples, we performed an indirect functional validation of selected pirna-linked genes by knocking down the known testis/ovary-specific pirna pathway genes from chicken, piwi-like protein  <dig>  and  <dig> . we first examined the expression patterns of ciwi and cili using qpcr and in situ hybridization. the expression of ciwi, detected by qpcr, was several folds higher in pgcs than in stage x blastoderms, gscs, and cefs . furthermore, the expression of ciwi was detected continually in the developing germ cells at various developmental stages of male and female gonads based on in situ localization. in the adult stage, the expression of ciwi was restricted to spermatogonia in males and oocytes in females . similar to ciwi, the expression of cili was also several folds higher in pgcs detected by qpcr  and localized to germ cells throughout the developmental stages based on in situ hybridization . however, the expression of cili was slightly stronger than that of ciwi. in the adult stage, the expression of cili was detected in spermatogonia and spermatocytes of males and in oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells in females .figure  <dig>

finally, we examined double-strand dna breakage in pgcs after maximum knockdown of ciwi and cili. approximately 48 h after knockdown, pgcs were incubated with anti-gamma h2a.x  followed by incubation with phycoerythrin. both ciwi and cili knockdown in pgcs resulted in clear anti-gamma h2a.x staining, indicating double-strand breakage. this dna double-strand breakage may be mediated by the increased amount of cr <dig> after knockdown of ciwi and cili. anti-gamma h2a.x staining was not detected in control pgcs .figure  <dig>

discussion
protein-coding genes and proteins have been explored by several functional genomic studies in animals and plants. however, protein-coding genes account for a small proportion of the whole genome. the most exciting area in recent genomic studies has been the discovery and functional analysis of ncrnas, which account for the majority of the genome and play critical roles in regulating protein-coding genes
 <cit> . ncrnas can be classified as long ncrnas  or short ncrnas . many high-throughput methods and annotation programs have been developed to identify ncrnas. among the high-throughput methods, the inexpensive production of large volumes of sequence data is the primary advantage of ngs over conventional methods
 <cit> . in this study, we performed ngs to identify short ncrnas in chicken pgcs. the data generated from high-throughput technologies can be difficult to manage
 <cit> . therefore, the millions of total reads obtained in this study were processed to obtain clean reads. after processing the sequences, total and unique reads were used to annotate small ncrnas. however, a significant proportion of sequencing reads were unannotated in all test samples. identifying ncrna sequences and their genomic locations can be complicated, since several classes of ncrnas are poorly conserved
 <cit> . these unannotated reads may include novel classes of ncrnas; therefore, their genomic conservation and potential functions on gene regulation should be explored.

in this study, annotated ncrnas may have a specific function in an organism. for example, trnas and rrnas are functionally essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. the trnas of eukaryotes contain stretches of base sequences that are similar to those found in their respective rrna, and these two rnas share common ancestral origins rather than common functions
 <cit> . snorna has diverse roles in rna silencing, telomerase maintenance and regulation of alternative splicing. dysregulation of snornas can cause cancer in humans
 <cit> . snrnas transcribed from rna polymerase ii are most abundant in the nucleus of eukaryotes. snrnas play important roles in the splicing of introns from primary genomic transcripts. additionally, snrnas regulate various aspects of rna biogenesis, from transcription to polyadenylation and rna stability
 <cit> . mirna is one of the best-studied classes of small rnas. they are highly abundant and conserved among several species and involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in various tissues
 <cit> . when we compared the rpkm values of small ncrnas among test samples, ncrnas originating from repeat sequences were upregulated in pgcs. in animals, sirnas and pirnas are mainly derived from repetitive elements . pirnas are produced through the dicer-independent biogenesis pathway, which results in mature species that are longer  than mirnas and sirnas
 <cit> . in this report, the most abundant base pair size among the unique reads in pgcs was ~ 26 nt, a characteristic of pirnas.

among the classes of ncrnas, pirnas are important post-transcriptional regulators in germ cells. they can be classified as repetitive element sequence-derived or protein-coding genes-derived based on their genomic origins
 <cit> . furthermore, the expression of most ncrnas is ubiquitous, but pirnas are expressed specifically in germ cells
 <cit> . however, little information is available on pirnas and their roles in germ cells of vertebrate species. in this report, we examined putative pirnas in pgcs compared with stage x blastoderms, gscs and cefs. the protrac output showed a higher proportion of pirnas  that were exclusively derived from different types of repeat sequences in pgcs. in addition, a significant proportion of pirnas were derived from genomic regions and other types of ncrnas in pgcs. since the protrac software identifies pirnas based on typical characteristics including the number of loci with t at position  <dig> or a at position  <dig> that is the so-called ping-pong signature, all identified pirnas in chicken pgcs might be amplified in the ping-pong cycle. when we examined the expression of cr <dig> and three repeat sequence-linked pirnas, pirna expression was high in pgcs compared with cr <dig> expression. this result indicates that these pirnas are already activated to control cr <dig> expression. based on the expression of  <dig> genic-transcript-linked pirnas along with their linked genes, the expression of most pirnas and pirna-linked genes were highly expressed in pgcs. this may indicate that these pirnas are produced from their linked genes to regulate various pgc functions. nevertheless, further investigation of the co-expression of pirnas and their linked genes in pgcs is required. in this report, we examined pathway information, functional domains and functions of pirna-linked genes. we found that the majority of pirna-linked genes are functionally related to germ cells, testis, and ovary in different vertebrates. pirnas are thought to be required for germ cell development in vertebrate species
 <cit> . not only pirnas but also pirna-linked genes showed predominant functions in the germ cells of vertebrate species
 <cit> . in addition, the expression level of specific pirnas in stage x blastoderms was very similar to those in pgcs. these pirnas may be localized to pgcs within stage x blastoderms, which is indicative of a post-zygotic origin
 <cit> . numerous genes in pirna functional pathways have been identified, including piwi/argonaute family genes, tudor family genes, maelstrom homolog, and vasa homolog
 <cit> . pirna pathway genes play crucial roles in germline determination during meiosis, gametogenesis, and transposon silencing. these functions may involve pirnas and may be achieved via rna interference silencing complex  mediated epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation
 <cit> . in drosophila, piwi, aubergine, or spindle-e regulates epigenetic function via heterochromatin proteins , which participates in the formation of heterochromatin along with histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> methyltransferase
 <cit> . silencing these genes in drosophila caused loss of heterochromatin formation by reduction of histone methyltransferase, and delocalization of hp <dig> and hp2
 <cit> . similarly, fission yeast lacking an risc component argonaute, dicer, or rna-dependent rna polymerase caused loss of histone methyltransferase and hp <dig> homolog at the centromeric heterochromatin
 <cit> .

we selected chicken homologs of two pirna pathway genes, ciwi and cili, for indirect functional validation of the putative pirna-linked genes obtained in this study. to our knowledge, these two piwi family members are only identified in chicken genome, and their expression pattern in pgcs was described in our recent study
 <cit> . we used gene-specific sirnas to knockdown ciwi and cili. after knockdown, we examined the expression of cr <dig> and five pirna-linked coding genes . these genes were selected based on their crucial roles in germ cells. the maximal knockdown of ciwi and cili significantly increased the expression of cr <dig> and rap2b in pgcs. pirnas and their linked genes play a major defense role against transposable elements. the over activation of transposable elements is associated with severely impaired gametogenesis and causes dna double-strand breakage in germ cells
 <cit> . according to previous studies, increased cr <dig> expression causes dna damage in pgcs. therefore, the expression of rap2b increased under these conditions. rap2b is a member of the ras superfamily that protects cells from dna damage in a p53-dependent manner
 <cit> . in contrast, knockdown of ciwi and cili decreased the expression of vdr and rgn in pgcs, which could impair germ cell development. vdr is crucial for vitamin d <dig> metabolism, ca2+ homeostasis, and gametogenesis
, and rgn is crucial for ca2+ homeostasis and gametogenesis
 <cit> . the nucleosome is composed of dna and multiple histone protein families, h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  in mammals, the h2a family is consists of three members, h2a.1-h2a. <dig>  h2a.z, and h2a.x. among these three members of h2a family, h2a.x becomes phosphorylated on residue serine  <dig>  in cells when double-stranded breaks are introduced into the dna
 <cit> . thus, accumulation of gamma h2a.x near break site is a rapid cellular response to the presence of dna double-strand breakage
 <cit> . it has been reported that the aubergine, spindle-e, and armitage mutations lead to germline-specific accumulation of gamma-h2a.x in drosophila <cit> . in addition, gamma h2a.x accumulates in normal chromosomes where the meiotic double-strand breaks are formed
 <cit> . in this study, to further confirm the dna double-strand breakage in pgcs, cells were subjected to h2a.x staining after knockdown of ciwi and cili. our results clearly indicated that pgcs undergo cr1-mediated dna double-strand breakage after knockdown of ciwi and cili. these results suggested that ciwi and cili interact with certain pirna-linked genes to protect germ cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified different types of ncrnas including pirnas in chicken pgcs. pirnas are closely related with pirna pathway genes, and functions specifically in germ cells. after knockdown of pirna pathway genes ciwi and cili, we found a transposable element-mediated dna double-strand breakage in chicken pgcs. several pirna-linked genes that play crucial role in germ cells were also altered in chicken pgcs. thus, our results significantly indicate the role of pirna pathway genes in the protection of germ cells.
