BACKGROUND
now that rinderpest has been eradicated, m. mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony , the aetiologic agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , is considered to be the most important threat to cattle farming in affected countries. although cbpp has been eradicated from most continents, it persists in africa. the disease is notifiable to the world organisation for animal health  and, following notification, export of live cattle to countries free of cbpp is forbidden. programmes for the control of cbpp involve vaccination, but eradication is based solely on slaughter of affected herds and strict control of animal movements. because of its economic importance, cbpp has received much attention especially when it affected industrialized countries. this was the case in the 1960's when australia started an eradication programme and in the 80's and 90's when europe suffered a re-emergence of the disease  <cit> . identification and diagnostic methods have been improved. this task was difficult as mmmsc belongs to a complex of species, the so-called "m. mycoides cluster". this cluster consists of five closely related mycoplasmas that are referred to as: m. mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony , m. mycoides subsp. capri , m. capricolum subsp. capricolum , m. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae , and mycoplasma leachii , the last being a group of strains that had remained unassigned until recently when a modification of the cluster taxonomy was proposed based on both phenotypic and recent phylogenetic studies  <cit> . the designation mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides large colony  was discarded and the corresponding "lc" isolates are now considered to be an additional serovar of mmc  <cit> . all members of the m. mycoides cluster share phenotypic and genetic traits. one very close relative of mmmsc is mmc, and indeed, the reference growth inhibition test using rabbit hyperimmune serum does not allow differentiation between these two subspecies. however, it is important to be able to identify mmmsc and mmc without ambiguity because the two organisms differ greatly in terms of pathogenicity, geographical distribution and quarantine regulations. unlike mmmsc, mmc affects mostly small ruminants where it can induce a syndrome called "makeps" with lesions including mastitis, arthritis, kerato-conjonctivitis, pneumonia and septicaemia  <cit> . it can also be found in the ear canal of asymptomatic animals  <cit> . mmc strains are found world-wide, especially where goats are raised. before  <dig>  the distinction of the two subspecies in vitro was difficult and findings were sometimes ambiguous as few tests were sufficiently discriminatory . analysis of cellular proteins by one-dimensional sds page showed that this approach could be used to distinguish mmmsc from mmc  <cit> . specific detection methods were then developed based on pcr technology and the empirical search for specific restriction sites in the amplified fragment or with pcr primers allowing a specific amplification  <cit> . finally, mmmsc specific monoclonal antibodies were obtained and, more recently, specific real-time pcr methods have also been validated  <cit> .

the two subspecies have been considered to be very close relatives that could be distinguished only by minute differences in vitro in spite of their marked differences of physiology in vivo. recent advances in sequencing and bioinformatics allow the comparison of whole bacterial genomes. the complete genome sequence of the mmmsc reference strain pg <dig> was made public in  <dig>  <cit> . here, we report the availability of the complete genomic sequence of an mmc strain and compare it with that of the mmmsc pg <dig> strain. we describe differences in chromosome organization, gene repertoire, sequence polymorphism, and consider possible links between these differences and the physiology of the two bacteria. in addition, the recent publication of the genome sequence of strain gm <dig>  allowed a genome-wide comparison for these two strains and an evaluation of intra-species polymorphism.

RESULTS
general genome features
the mmc  <dig> genome consists of a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp  and of a plasmid of  <dig>  bp . the chromosome has a g+c content of only  <dig>  mole%. genome annotation revealed  <dig> putative cds, two integrative conjugative elements , each being on average  <dig> kbp long and including  <dig> cds, and  <dig> recognized copies of insertion sequences  belonging to five different is types. two sets of rrna genes and  <dig> trnas can be predicted. putative genes corresponding to the tmrna and the rna component of the rnase p were also found, as in other mycoplasmas.

overview of genome structure and plasticity
the mauve alignment of mmc  <dig>  mmmsc pg <dig>  and the slightly more distant california kid  genome sequences allowed the identification of  <dig> locally collinear blocks  that were interspaced by mmc-specific dna stretches of various lengths . six of these mmc-specific stretches merit special attention.

the first contains ten cds , six of which constitute a predicted lipoprotein  family for which the best similarity scores were found with m. agalactiae or mcc, whereas no homologues were found in mmmsc. this gene family was previously described as a candidate for an horizontal gene transfer  between m. agalactiae and the m. mycoides cluster  <cit> . the absence of homologues in mmmsc may be the consequence of a deletion from this pathogen after the hgt event.

the second is a stretch of  <dig> cds  forming a maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster. most of these cds exhibit substantial similarity with genes in distantly related genera, such as listeria or bacillus, again suggestive of acquisition by hgt. interestingly, the last four genes  had homologues in mcc, an indication that mcc may have previous contained, and then lost, the first eight cds of the cluster.

the third  and fourth  specific dna stretches correspond to two copies of the integrative conjugative element   that are  <dig> and  <dig> kbp long, respectively.

the fifth specific dna stretch contains a pseudogene and six cds . the second and third cds were similar to two ice cds  with the last four cds being identified as is <dig> copies. therefore, this dna stretch appears to be the remains of an ice copy after a partial deletion.

finally, the sixth specific dna stretch contains five cds  with four of them showing either no similarity to known sequences in any organism or showing similarity with sequences in non-mollicute organisms , suggesting again a possible indication of hgt. mlc_ <dig> and mlc_ <dig> show similarities with viral a-type inclusion protein, consistent with this possibility.

the mauve genome alignment clearly indicated inversions of large dna fragments including one or more collinear blocks. only five of such events were identified between mmc and mmmsc  and nine with mcc, consistent with mmc and mmmsc being more closely related to each other than to mcc. the initial orientation of these lcb could be deduced for those that were colinear and with a similar orientation in two of the three genomes. for four of the five , the dna inversion occurred in the mmmsc genome with the inverted lcbs being flanked by is copies . the exception is lcb  <dig>  which is flanked by two ice copies in opposite direction in the mmc- <dig> genome, an indication that this inversion occurred during the duplication and insertion of the first ice copy 

mobile elements: integrative conjugative elements
the two ice copies identified in the  <dig> genome were not found in the other available genomes of the m. mycoides cluster, including mmc gm <dig>  this genome contains an ice but it is located elsewhere on the chromosome. this suggests that these mobile elements were recently inserted into the  <dig> genome. the two ice copies differ slightly in size  but are otherwise almost identical . the cds are very similar to those of the ice found in mcc . four cds seemed to be more conserved among mycoplasmas: cds  <dig> and  <dig>  at the extremities of the ice but contiguous in the circular form, and cds  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode trag and trae, respectively. for cds  <dig> and  <dig>  the highest similarity was found with homologues in mmc strain gm <dig> , mcc california kid , and partial sequences of m. agalactiae pg <dig> . they were more distantly related to an m. fermentans cds .

the two mmc  <dig> ice copies are in opposite orientation and flank an  <dig>  kbp-long dna fragment which is inverted, in relation to the most closely related genomes . examination of the direct repeats at the insertion sites of the ice clearly showed that a recombination had occurred between them, resulting in the observed chromosomal inversion. it is therefore likely that the organization of this region is the result of successive events including the initial integration of an ice, the duplication and integration of the ice at a second site in the opposite orientation and finally recombination between the two copies .

we used a pcr primer pair designed to amplify a fragment of the well conserved trag gene  to screen for the presence of this type of ice in a representative set of  <dig> strains of the m. mycoides cluster and other ruminant mycoplasmas . amplification products were obtained for four of the ten mmc strains, indicating that these strains carried closely related ice. two additional primers , designed to flank the insertion site of one of the  <dig> ice copies, were used for pcr analysis of dna from the same set of strains. of the four trag-positive mmc strains, three yielded the expected  <dig>  bp-long amplicon, indicating that the detected ice was integrated elsewhere on the chromosome of these strains. as expected, strain  <dig> dna did not yield any amplified product because the primers were separated by about  <dig> kbp and in the same orientation. the absence of amplification with "trag" and "vip" for the five other strains dna was not expected; it may have been due to sequence variations that hampered the correct annealing of the primers or by other, unidentified, genetic rearrangements.

a whenever possible, strains originating from different continents were selected to improve the representivity of the sample. pcr results are recorded as positive  or negative  with primer pairs designed to detect the presence of insertion sequences , integrative conjugative elements  or the insertion of an integrative conjugative element at a specific location . non specific pcr primers corresponding to 16srdna genes were used as positive amplification controls.

b these strains were formerly identified as m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc

mobile elements: plasmid
plasmid pmmc- <dig> is  <dig>  bp long and has a g+c content of  <dig>  mole%. it is predicted to encode two proteins probably involved in plasmid replication. the protein encoded by orfa is similar to several replication  proteins of plasmids replicating by a rolling-circle mechanism. the putative pmmc- <dig> rep protein has a conserved architecture domain corresponding to that of rep_ <dig> plasmid replication proteins . the sequence included five motifs typical of pmv <dig> plasmid family  <cit> . the protein encoded by orfb has a sequence structure similar to that of the rhh_ <dig> ribbon-helix-helix family of copg repressor proteins . copg, also known as repa, is a transcriptional regulator that controls the plasmid copy number in the pmv <dig> derivative pls <dig>  <cit> . several plasmids with sizes between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp have been isolated from mycoplasmas related to the m. mycoides cluster. plasmid pkmk <dig>  was isolated from a mmc strain ; it has a size similar to that of pmmc- <dig> and the predicted proteins of the two plasmids share more than 97% similarity  <cit> . complete nucleotide sequence alignment indicated nearly identical sequences. plasmids padb <dig> , pbg7au  and pmybk <dig>  were isolated from m. mycoides, m. leachii and m. yeatsii, respectively  <cit> . padb <dig> and pbg7au encode two proteins similar to orfa and orfb from pmmc- <dig>  but pmybk <dig> does not. interestingly, nucleotide alignments of the plasmid sequences suggested a composite origin of plasmid padb201: the first thousand nucleotides are very similar to pbg7au sequences whereas downstream sequences were closely related to sequences found in pmmc- <dig> and pkmk <dig>  this suggests that plasmids found in various mycoplasma species of the m. mycoides cluster may circulate among strains and recombine to generate new hybrid plasmids.

more surprisingly, blast search using pmmc- <dig> nucleotide sequence identified a non-coding, gc-rich sequence of  <dig> nt showing 96% identity with two mmc chromosome regions . these regions are located within ices, between cds <dig> and the terminal inverted repeat. three palindromic sequences of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides were repeated two to five times with the potential to form several stem-loop structures. a related sequence was also found in the ice in mmc strain gm <dig> and in plasmids pkmk <dig> and padb <dig>  the distribution of this trait suggests that ices and plasmids have probably exchanged sequences. this highly structured region covers a  <dig> bp sequence identified as the single-strand origin  of pkmk <dig> replication . in rolling-circle replication plasmids, the sso is the initiation site of lagging strand synthesis and is essential for the conversion of a single-strand intermediate into a double-strand molecule. the identification of an sso-type region in ices raises the question of whether this plasmid-derived sequence is involved in icemmc <dig> dissemination.

mobile elements: insertion sequences
five different types of insertion sequences  were identified in the mmc  <dig> genome. nine copies of is <dig> were identified. they were very similar to is <dig> copies present in the mmmsc pg <dig> genome both in terms of length and deduced amino-acid sequence . six copies of ismmy <dig> were identified. the similarity with those found in mmmsc pg <dig> was high  but lower than for is <dig>  six copies of a novel is named ismmy <dig> were found; one of the copies was considered as the prototype for a new is and has been submitted to genbank . this is is  <dig>  bp long, contains 24-bp inverted repeats and appears to have generated 3-bp-long direct repeats at its insertion sites. it contains a putative ribosome binding site   <dig> bp upstream from the atg start codon of a  <dig>  bp-long orf ; the orf possesses a classical dde catalytic site motif. accordingly, this is was identified as belonging to the is <dig> family and the is <dig> group. the presence of ismmy <dig> in related strains was evaluated by two techniques: southern blotting with a dig-labelled probe  and pcr using a single primer corresponding to the conserved part of the inverted repeat found at the extremities of the is element . the results with the two techniques were entirely consistent: elements related to ismmy <dig> were detected in six of ten strains tested belonging to the subspecies mmc and mmc. however, this is was not detected by either of the two techniques in any of four mmmsc strains. the absence of detectable ismmy <dig> in the mmmsc subspecies was not expected, given that this is shares substantial similarity with two contiguous mmmsc cds. a single dna sequence homologous to ismmy <dig> was however found between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the mmmsc pg <dig> sequence . this sequence seems to represent the remnant of an ismmy <dig> without transposase activity because it carries a mutation disrupting the transposase gene. the sequence found in mmmsc pg <dig> may thus be the result of ensuing genetic drift by accumulation of insertions, deletions  and point mutations. the failure to detect this sequence by southern hybridization may be explained by the presence of hindiii sites in the mmmsc pg <dig> ismmy2-remnant sequence  resulting in much smaller fragments. the failure to detect these sequences by pcr was clearly due to the absence of the right inverted repeat essential for pcr amplification with a single primer.

two copies of another novel insertion sequence, named ismmy <dig> were found. ismmy <dig> is  <dig>  bp long with  <dig> nt long terminal inverted repeats that are only partially identical  and has generated 3bp direct repeats. it encodes two putative polypeptides that may be fused to form a transposase as there is a potential frameshift position between nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig>  this new is therefore belongs to the is <dig> family and it closely resembles is <dig> . ismmy <dig> was detected in three of ten mmc strains tested but was not detected in mmmsc or mcc strains .

a fragment of another insertion sequence was detected . this partial is copy codes for a single protein that shares 60% similarity with transposase protein a of the is <dig> found in mmmsc. a very similar partial copy is also found in mcc california kid strain .

the diversity of is types and copy numbers in the mmc strains can be assessed by comparison of the gm <dig> and  <dig> genomes . both genomes contain eight copies of is <dig> but only two of them are inserted at the same locations. this indicates that transposition events are relatively frequent for this is. in addition the presence of copies of is on either side of an inverted linear block in gm <dig> shows that is duplication and transposition may lead to major genome rearrangements. note also that three other is types  present in  <dig> do not appear to be associated with any rearrangement. the only other major rearrangement in the  <dig> genome was triggered by an ice.

mmc-specific clusters: the maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster
a specific stretch of  <dig> cds was identified downstream from an is <dig> copy . none of these cds have any significant similarity with the pg <dig> genome. all have similarities with genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and more specifically starch/glycogen and maltose utilization  . this cluster is composed of genes coding for a phosphoglucomutase , amylases that may be involved in starch degradation, two lipoproteins that may be involved in substrate binding, a hypothetical protein with transmembrane segments, followed by malc, malg, and malk genes that may encode a translocation complex, mapa  a maltose phosphorylase, dexa  a gene encoding oligo- <dig>  glycosidase and, at the end, a transcription regulator. most of these genes are similar to genes found in other bacteria such as listeria, mycoplasma , and lactococcus, but the most similar homologues were mostly in bacillus in which maltose and maltodextrin utilization has been documented  <cit> . a tentative model for starch and maltodextrin utilization can be established for mmc  <dig> with the two lipoproteins encoded by the cluster possibly involved in substrate binding  and mlc_ <dig> in transmembrane transport. only four genes of this operon were found in the mcccalifornia kid genome and none were found in mmmsc pg <dig> although the flanking genes were present . this suggests that this cluster was present in the ancestor of the m. mycoides cluster and that the whole cluster has been deleted from mmmsc pg <dig>  for mcc california kid, part of the cluster has been deleted and replaced by  <dig> cds found inserted at this position. the maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster is fully conserved in the mmc gm <dig> genome but there is no is <dig> copy found upstream.

lipoproteins
the number of predicted lipoproteins  was strikingly higher for mmc  <dig>  than for pg <dig> . sixty of these lpp in mmc  <dig> can be grouped into  <dig> families, and seven are organised in clusters . many of these clustered lpp are absent from mmmsc pg <dig> or are interrupted by is elements. in contrast, all these clusters were found in strain gm <dig> with a perfect synteny with the  <dig> genome. however, the similarity  differed greatly from one lpp to another , whereas the flanking housekeeping genes were well conserved . for example, the five lpp illustrated in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  form a family with a highly conserved signal peptide and lipoprotein cleavage site  and some conserved stretches in their c terminal parts. the presence of is at this locus may be an indication that these elements played a role in the duplication of these genes. similar lpp are present at the same location in the gm <dig> genome  and were identified as putative variable lipoproteins. the similarity of these  <dig> lpp with the gm <dig> lpp was between  <dig> and 93%. these lpp also shared similarities with a cluster of lpp found in mcc , identified as "vmc". they vary in length and display repeated aa motifs which are typical of variable lipoproteins in mycoplasmas. such repeated motifs were not identified in the corresponding  <dig> and gm <dig> lpp. differences in lipoprotein expression may be linked to the length variation of poly ta tracts within the promoter region of the lpp.

this phase variation has been described for vmm lipoproteins in mmmsc strains  <cit> . poly-ta tracts with more than ten repeats were found at five positions in the pg <dig> chromosome. three of these positions are immediately upstream from genes encoding lpp  and the two others are near to transposase genes. such poly-ta tracts are also found in the  <dig> genome, at six positions. all precede lpp genes and the number of ta repeats differs: mlc_ <dig> ; mlc_ <dig> ; mlc_ <dig> ; mlc_ <dig> ; mlc_ <dig> ; mlc_ <dig> . a lc-ms/ms proteomic approach allowed the detection of  <dig> lipoproteins in  <dig> and only  <dig> in mmmsc pg <dig>  and thus a similar proportion  of the predicted genes in each strain. of the six lpp at the locus shown in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  only two were detected.

one mmc  <dig> lpp family, with genes downstream from an is <dig> element and that shares some similarity with the spma family in m. agalactiae, is not present in mmmsc  <cit>  . in m. agalactiae, the genes of the homologous family are also clustered and most of them are preceded by g-rich stretch that may be involved in the regulation of expression. interestingly, in the mmc  <dig> genome, intergenic regions upstream from these genes contain a conserved gc17- <dig> motif  <dig> to  <dig> nt upstream from the atg start codon. a similar motif 16) is present  <dig> nt upstream from the atg of the unique member of the homologous family in mcc. the function of these motifs that are unique in these highly at-rich genomes, like the function of m. agalactiae g-rich repeats, is unknown.

three genes involved in lipoprotein processing were identified in mmc 95010: two encoding diacylglyceryl transferases  and one a lipoprotein signal peptidase . by contrast, only one lgt was found in the mmmsc pg <dig> genome; the gene orthologous to the second lgt is interrupted by a frameshift mutation resulting in two "hypothetical proteins"  that are not identified as lgt or pseudogenes in the current annotation of the mmmsc pg <dig> genome. phylogenetic analysis of diacylglyceryl transferase across mollicutes reveals that most species possess only one lgt gene but that duplication has occurred in the ancestor of the spiroplasma phylogenetic group. whether the inactivation of one copy in mmmsc pg <dig> has affected the lipoprotein processing in this strain is not known.

pseudogenisation in mmmsc pg <dig> and genes interrupted by mobile elements
the annotation process of the mmc  <dig> genome identified  <dig> cds that were highly similar to two or three contiguous cds in mmmsc pg <dig>  these mmmsc pg <dig> cds correspond to pseudogenes  that were not identified as such at the time of the annotation because no sequence from a related mycoplasma was available . the proteomic approach allowed the detection of peptides for  <dig> of these  <dig> mmc  <dig> genes. surprisingly, five products from the corresponding interrupted mmmsc genes were also detected. these products may result from the expression of a partial gene. alternatively, there may be errors in the mmmsc pg <dig> sequence. in addition to disruption of genes by frameshift mutations, five pg <dig> genes were truncated by insertion sequences. only three of these five genes had orthologues in mmc . conversely, four cds in mmc  <dig> are interrupted by is elements but only one of them was similar to a gene in mmmsc pg <dig> . three mmc  <dig> genes  had orthologues in mmmsc pg <dig> that are altered: the mmmsc leucylpeptidase gene is truncated, giving two cds  by a frameshift mutation; the protease gene is interrupted by an insertion sequence ; and the endopeptidase  gene is shorter by  <dig> codons than the mmc  <dig> ortholog. the inactivation of these three genes may explain why mmmsc pg <dig> is less able to hydrolyse proteins as evidenced by the inspissated serum digestion test .

a "+" indicates that the protein was detected by lc-ms/ms with at least  <dig> disctinct peptides. mmmsc cds should be considered as pseudogenes unless there was a sequencing error leading to an artefactual frameshift mutation.

list of cds with frameshift mutations in the mmmsc pg <dig> genome as evidenced by comparison with mmc cds.

the insertion of these  <dig> ice copies in the mmc  <dig> genome has disrupted two cds. the first encodes a putative lipoprotein  whose orthologue in mmc gm <dig>  is  <dig> aa long. the second encodes a putative permease,  <dig> aa long, annotated as a pseudogene in  <dig> , whose orthologue in gm <dig>  is  <dig> aa long and possesses two ftsx domains that may be associated with lipid transport. a gene orthologous to this permease was also found in the mmmsc pg <dig> sequence .

global comparison of gene repertoires
a search for orthologous genes in the mmc  <dig>  mmmsc pg <dig> and mcc california kid genomes identified various clusters of orthologs that were specific to each genome or shared by two or three genomes .

the majority of the  <dig> pg1-specific clusters , correspond to hypothetical proteins and predicted lipoproteins, most  of which, however, are considered to be pseudogenes. in addition, two clusters identified as an aspartate-trna ligase  and a ctp synthetase  are in fact partial sequences that were erroneously annotated and should also be considered as pseudogenes. msc_ <dig> maps near two other cds that are duplicated, probably when an is element transposed . the same event may have occurred for three clusters identified as cps, glf and gale  which are partial duplicated copies of genes with orthologues in  <dig>  these sequences should also have been annotated as "putative pseudogenes". in addition, pg1-specific clusters included restriction modification genes, notably an adenine or cytosine methylase .

as expected, some transposase genes and genes belonging to the maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster were identified as mmc 95010-specific cds . one cds coding for a predicted mate efflux family protein  was identified . these proteins mediate resistance to a wide range of cationic dyes, fluroquinolones, aminoglycosides and other structurally diverse antibodies and drugs, and most possess  <dig> alpha-helical transmembrane regions. this is the case for mlc_ <dig> in strain  <dig> but apparently not in strain gm <dig> in which the cds has been disrupted resulting in two cds which should be considered to be pseudogenes.

some ribosomal proteins, such as rpmj, rpss, rpsn and a preprotein translocase secg, were identified as specific for a subset of strains . this may be a consequence of the very small size of these proteins which resulted in very low blast e values or, more frequently, of incorrect annotation of the pg <dig> genome. this could be evidenced by a blastn search that identified rpmj and rpsn in the pg <dig> sequence at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and the identification of secg at position  <dig>  the  <dig> cds clusters that were found as orthologous in all of mmmsc pg <dig>  mmc  <dig> and mcc california kid  may be considered as the "m. mycoides core genome".

a blast analysis of whole cds in mmc strains  <dig> and gm <dig> showed that 80% of these cds shared more than 90% identity. this illustrates the very close relatedness of the two genomes and confirms their classification as belonging to the same subspecies. the divergent cds had identity values that varied from  <dig> to 90% . many corresponded to partial sequences that may be considered as pseudogenes and the lower identity values may be due to these sequences being short or to the fact that mutations are likely to accumulate more rapidly in pseudogenes than in functional genes. other divergent genes were identified as lipoproteins and the percentage of identity for these genes varied from 30% to 90%. similar polymorphism was also evidenced in membrane surface expressed proteins highlighting the highly dynamic and diverse surface architecture of otherwise closely related strains. this is undoubtedly a consequence of environmental pressures that shape the variability of these surface exposed proteins. this variability also explains why reference identification tests such as the growth inhibition test may give such variable results as hyperimmune sera contain large amounts of antibodies directed towards these immunodominant antigens. divergent cds also included restriction and modification genes such as "c <dig> cytosine dna methylase" , "gcatc recognizing type ii restriction modification system" , "restriction endonuclease" , "modification methylase" , "cytosine-specific dna methyltransferase sau96i"  and "type ii site specific deoxyribonuclease " .

discussion
our goal was to compare the genomes of two very closely related mycoplasma subspecies and accurately determine their degree of relatedness. this can be done at various levels by comparing the genome organization, the gene repertoire and the polymorphisms within the genes.

genome plasticity in mycoplasmas of the mycoides cluster is greatly influenced by the "mobilome" and more specifically by ice and is. such elements were evidenced in the  <dig> genome and have been shown to drive overall genome plasticity.

integrative conjugative elements have a modular structure and contain blocks of genes dedicated to integration into and excision from the chromosome, as well as conjugal transfer  <cit> . until recently, ices had been evidenced in a limited range of hosts belonging to the four major divisions of bacteria. however, whole genome sequencing projects suggest that ices are widespread in bacteria and could be one of the main types of shuttle for horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . ices have now been identified in various mycoplasma species, including m. fermentans, m. agalactiae and mcc  <cit> . the ice copy number in mycoplasmas seems to be small, for example only four copies of two ice types in m. fermentans. ice copy numbers are much higher in other bacterial species: in orienta tsutsugamushi duplicated elements, including ices, account for more than 37% of the genome  <cit> . our analysis of the mmc genome shows that these elements have a direct impact on genome rearrangements, although the exact mechanisms leading to excision, integration and/or conjugation to another cell remain to be elucidated. in the genus bacillus, transfer of ice copies seems to be favoured by high densities of cells not carrying these elements and integration into a cell apparently leads to blocking the entry of additional copies  <cit> . the possibility that these elements are involved in transferring virulence factors to and between mycoplasmas needs to be investigated.

comparison of plasmids from the mycoides cluster suggested that various recombination events may have occurred during the spread of these plasmids among strains. more surprisingly, alignments of plasmid and ice sequences in mmc  <dig> indicated that these mobile elements may have exchanged sequences. this new finding suggests that these two types of mobile elements could interact within mycoplasma cells and maybe even cooperate in transmission from cell to cell.

insertion sequences are another driving force for genome plasticity in the mycoplasma mycoides cluster. comparisons of genomes revealed substantial diversity of is type and copy number even between closely related strains  and that duplication of is copies may lead to large dna fragment inversions. this contrasts with the findings for two m. agalactiae genomes in which the presence of  <dig> is copies and three ice copies was not associated with any large-scale genetic rearrangement  <cit> . in the case of the mycoides cluster, the major contribution of is to genome plasticity is well illustrated by the comparison between mmc and mmmsc genomes. the mmmsc pg <dig> genome has large numbers of is copies, is <dig> having the highest copy number . these is-elements have not only led to large dna fragment inversions but also large dna fragment duplications and deletions. this is not unprecedented in the bacterial world and is expansions may result from an evolutionary bottleneck due to bacterial population isolation  <cit> . in the case of mmmsc pg <dig>  this bottleneck may have been associated with the strict adaptation of this subspecies to the bovine lung. indeed, is <dig> shares 97% identity with ismbov <dig> which is found in m. bovis, a very common pathogen isolated from cow lungs  <cit> . this close relatedness certainly indicates recent hgt and the absence of is <dig> from mmc suggests that this is was acquired by mmmsc from m. bovis. such exchanges of is in between the mycoides cluster and the m. bovis/m. agalactiae cluster have already been proposed  <cit> .

a striking feature of the mmmsc pg <dig> genome, as compared to those of mmc  <dig> and gm <dig>  is the large number of pseudogenes in the vicinity of is elements. altogether, more than  <dig> mmmsc of the originally described putative genes are certainly pseudogenes as a result of frameshift mutations or inserted insertion sequences. this represents more than 9% of the total number of mmmsc genes that were annotated in  <dig>  high percentages of pseudogenes are often associated with a recent adaptation to a host and to virulence, as suggested for yersinia pestis  <cit> . adaptation to a new host allows a massive clonal population growth in which all mutations affecting genes that are not essential for bacterial survival in the new environment are maintained. such clonal expansion also explains the limited polymorphism of the housekeeping genes. reductive evolution of this type has been described for various pathogens in addition to yersinia pestis, including orienta tsutsugamushi, the agent of scrub typhus, ricketsia prowazeckii, the agent of epidemic typhus and aliivibrio salmonicida, the agent of cold-water vibriosis  <cit> . in the case of mmmsc, adaptation to a new host may also have favoured the acquisition and multiplication of new is types, such as is <dig>  similarly, pseudogenisation was also observed in m. bovis, where an adhesin of m. agalactiae was inactivated upon infection of a different host  <cit> . longer evolution times would possibly allow a streamlining of the genome with a reduction of the number of pseudogenes by a deletion process. mmc is an ubiquitous pathogen that is present in numerous species  all around the world; it is an opportunist pathogen that can infect diverse organs and can even be found in the ear canal of healthy goats . by contrast, mmmsc is strictly pathogenic and limited to a single host, cows, and to a single organ, the lung. this is consistent with an mmc ancestor, adapted to various ecological niches in small ruminants, adapting to a bovine host where it colonizes only the lungs, and evolving into what is now known as mmmsc. genomic studies, and particularly the observation that intraspecies polymorphism in housekeeping genes is much more limited in mmmsc than in mmc, support the hypothesis that mmmsc emerged only recently  <cit> .

the availability of whole genome sequences may help unravel the genetic events underlying phenotypic diversity among closely related strains. as an example, the utilization of maltose in the m. mycoides cluster species has been studied by abugroun  <cit> : no maltose utilization was found in mmmsc. maltose is utilized by mcc and more rapidly by mmc. however, some mmc strains failed to metabolize maltose at all. the presence of an alpha glucosidase was also detected by a rapid colorimetric test using pnpg flooded on mycoplasma colonies  <cit> . none of the mmmsc strains tested possessed any glucosidase activity although most mcc and mmc strains did. however mmmsc strains express beta-glucosidases with variations which may be related to cytotoxicity  <cit> . our findings are in accordance with these observations. what remains to be verified is the integrity of the maltose gene cluster in the mmc strains that fail to utilize this substrate, and the ability of mmc strains to utilize starch. mcc california kid is expected to be unable to use starch, although other mcc strains should be able metabolize this carbon source.

surface proteins and more specifically lipoproteins that play key roles in interactions with the environment are determinant for the lifestyle of mycoplasmas. they contribute to the uptake of nutrients and can mediate essential functions during the infection cycle. some play a role in cytadhesion, and other bind igas to allow the cells to escape cellular recognition  <cit> . surface proteins can also display mechanisms of phase variation as a means to escape the host immune responses  <cit> . at the same time they are excellent immunogens, their lipid moiety acting with adjuvant-like proinflammatory activity and their protein part evoking an immune response  <cit> . however, the type of immune response they trigger may vary according to the lpp involved. in the case of mmmsc pg <dig>  lppa seems to trigger a cellular response, involving cd <dig> cells producing interferon gamma, whereas lppq, lppb and lppc do not  <cit> . the presence of  <dig> genes coding for lpp in the mmc  <dig> genome, as compared to  <dig> in mmmsc pg <dig>  is in agreement with findings in other mycoplasma species. the number of lpp genes in two strains of m. agalactiae is  <dig> and  <dig>  the latter number being that of reference strain pg <dig>  <cit> . in m. agalactiae, poly-g tracts are suspected to be involved in genomic rearrangements and possibly in the control of expression of genes in the region encoding the so-called spma lipoprotein family  <cit> . a locus encoding homologous predicted lipoproteins was found in mmc  <dig> with intergenic regions containing gc7- <dig> motifs. this suggests that there may have been exchange of genes belonging to this family between these ruminant pathogens followed by divergent evolution of intergenic motifs and subsequent expansion of the gene families. in accordance with this hypothesis, only one single member of this family was found in mcc genome whereas variable expansions were observed in the two strains of m. agalactiae. in m. mycoides, intergenic nucleotide tracts are found at other loci. poly-ta tracts, with more than  <dig> repeats, were found at six locations both in the  <dig> and the gm <dig> genomes. the size of these tracts differed between strains. however, these size variations should be interpreted with great care as most sequencing projects use cloned bacterial stocks: such variants may differ from the main population. in  <dig>  the percentage of lpp that were detected by the proteomic analysis was 30%. this is slightly lower than reported by other studies in which amphiphilic proteins were first concentrated by triton x- <dig> extraction  <cit> . as a consequence, the differences may simply be due to differences in the sensitivity detection of the techniques used. in addition, lpp expression may be driven by environmental conditions and our results apply only to mycoplasmas grown in rich media, in vitro. co-incubation and adhesion to cells may well trigger the expression of a different set of lpp as has been demonstrated for m. pneumoniae in contact with lung epithelial cells  <cit> . this type of modulation of expression may play an important role in virulence.

in fact, the evolution of mmmsc genome may be shaped by unconstrained population growth in infected animals, followed by extreme transmission bottlenecks from host to host. furthermore, current mmmsc strain populations may also be shaped by cbpp control strategies based on slaughter and vaccination. existing mmmsc strains may well have adapted to this artificial selection that has been implemented for more than  <dig> years. the mmmsc genome is larger than that of mmc, mostly due to gene duplications, and the insertion of multiple copies of insertion sequences. is elements seem to play a prominent role in this gene rearrangement process, as demonstrated during growth in vitro under conditions of stress induced by high temperature   <cit> . fever in cbpp-infected animals may induce a similar stress and favour gene rearrangements in mmmsc. however, the mmmsc genome is also characterized by a high degree of gene decay with more than 9% of the originally described genes likely to be pseudogenes. many of these genes are not associated with any known function , consistent with the notion that the number of genes in whole genomes is often overestimated  <cit> . this fits also well with a non-adaptative genomic complexity theory allowing duplications or pseudogenes to be maintained in the absence of an adaptive selection that would lead to purifying selection and genome streamlining  <cit> .

genome structure in both of the subspecies seems to have been affected by mobile genetic elements despite these elements differing in kind and in numbers. integrative conjugative elements have been identified in mmc where they were shown to induce chromosomal rearrangements, but not in mmmsc. they may also have played a role in gene acquisition although this has not yet been demonstrated. insertion sequences were identified in both subspecies but, here again, there are differences: mmc and mmmsc have only two is types in common and mmmsc possess only three is types present in large copy numbers  whereas mmc possess five is types but only in lower copy numbers . again the larger copy number in mmmsc may be associated with an evolutionary bottleneck such that they provide transitory selective advantages to their host such as hgt and genomic rearrangements  <cit> .

homologous recombination has been demonstrated experimentally in mcc and mmc strains  <cit> . this does not seem to be the case in mmmsc where multiple attempts to obtain homologous recombinations in vitro have failed  <cit> . these failures could be linked to the functional absence of two genes, recg and recr, which are disrupted by frameshift mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
comparing the genomes of two subspecies allows a micro-evolutionary analysis. genome evolution is expected to be directly linked to the ecological niche of the two organisms and the driving forces shaping chromosome organization, gene content and sequence evolution. preliminary data, using multilocus sequence typing, had already shown that mmc strains were much more diverse than mmmsc strains  <cit> . this is consistent with the different ecology of the two organisms and the associated population dynamics.

the comparison of the mmc and mmmsc genomes has revealed their very close relatedness, especially evident from the sequence similarities in their housekeeping genes. however, in view of the earlier belief that the two subspecies were nearly indistinguishable, there is a surprisingly large number of differences. many of the differences are associated with genes of unknown function, and many of these genes may have been acquired by hgt. note also that comparison of single strain genomes is limiting because a single genome cannot reflect the gene repertoire of a species. in addition, the comparison with mmmsc pg <dig> could lead to some bias as this strain is a "laboratory" strain which has lost its pathogenicity and its genome has been subject to genetic drift since its, unknown, time of isolation. understanding the real driving forces of genetic fluidity will certainly need further sequencing, whole genome assemblies and re-annotation of many well-characterised field strains, not only of mmc and mmmsc but also of closely related species or and other bacterial species that share the same ecological niche.
