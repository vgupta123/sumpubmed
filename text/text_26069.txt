BACKGROUND
nitrogen is a crucial nutrient that is both essential and rate limiting for plant growth and seed production. nitrogen is assimilated in plants through the action of glutamine synthetase  forming glutamine, which serves as a building block for all nitrogen containing compounds in the plant. gs is a complex and highly regulated enzyme, which in addition to the primary ammonium assimilation, is involved in the reassimilation of ammonium released by a number of biochemical processes such as photorespiration, protein catabolism, deamination of amino acids and some specific biosynthetic reactions such as those involving methionine, isoleucine, phenylpropanoid and lignin  <cit> . being the first enzyme in the main pathway of ammonium assimilation in higher plants, gs potentially represents a key component of plant nitrogen use efficiency  and yield and therefore, an extensive number of studies have been dedicated to understand how gs is regulated and how it is involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in plants  <cit> .

legumes can obtain a significant part of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through a symbiotic interaction with nitrogen fixing bacteria. perhaps due to this special source of nitrogen, legumes produce protein-rich seeds with a high nutritive value, representing a major source of nutrients for humans and animal livestock. because of the ecological, nutritional and economic importance of legume seeds, the biochemical and molecular processes underlying their development have been the focus of much research in recent years. with the development of genomic resources for medicago truncatula, recently this model legume has been chosen for an integrative approach toward understanding seed physiology and great advances have been made in understanding the metabolic control of seed filling and the regulatory network underlying reserve accumulation  <cit> . an original finding raised by these studies is that the genes involved in amino acid metabolism are among the most highly regulated in the seeds of m. truncatula  <cit> . the accumulation of storage proteins in seeds, involves n-remobilization from vegetative organs, a process in which gs is likely a key regulator, but although the enzyme has been thoroughly investigated in several organs of different plant species, and especially in legumes, it has been poorly investigated in seeds.

a number of gs isoenzymes has been identified in plants and classified according to the sub cellular localization as cytosolic  and plastidic , which are assumed to play non-overlapping roles. gs <dig> isoenzymes are involved in nitrogen assimilation and recycling derived from several different physiological processes , whereas gs <dig> has been mainly implicated in the reassimilation of the ammonia released during photorespiration  <cit> . genetic studies revealed that gs <dig> is encoded by a single gene per haploid genome, whereas several genes encode cytosolic polypeptides  <cit> . functional gs <dig> allelic genes have been reported in the amphidiploid tobacco  <cit> , the tetraploid alfalfa  <cit>  and the hexaploid wheat  <cit> . there is no evidence for the existence of multiple gs <dig> genes in any plant species and clearly, arabidopsis thaliana and rice, two plants whose genomes have been fully sequenced, contain a single gene encoding gs <dig> 

m. truncatula provides an excellent model system for the study of gs, as it contains a very small gs gene family. only three expressed gs genes have been reported: mtgs1a and mtgs1b encoding cytosolic polypeptides and mtgs <dig> encoding a plastid located enzyme  <cit> . however the genome of m. truncatula has been reported to contain two additional genes related to gs, the pseudogene mtgs1c which was found not to be expressed  <cit>  and a prokaryotic type gsi-like gene, whose function is unknown  <cit> . this study reports the existence of a new gene encoding a second plastid located isoenzyme in medicago truncatula. the gene was identified following the development of the genomic resources for m. truncatula  <cit>  and is characterized in this article. evidence is presented that the gene arose from a duplication event which occurred after legume speciation and that it produces a functional enzyme, exclusively expressed in developing seeds and particularly during seed filling.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of a new gene encoding a plastid-located glutamine synthetase in medicago truncatula
following the advances in m. truncatula genome sequencing, a new gene encoding a plastid located gs was identified using the available genomic sequence data from the large-scale genome assembly for this model plant  <cit> . this newly identified gene is located on chromosome  <dig> approximately  <dig> kbp downstream of the previously characterized mtgs <dig> gene  and both genes are comprised within m. truncatula bac mth2-53e <dig>  . the existence of a second plastid-located gs  gene in the plant genome was confirmed by southern blot analysis of m. truncatula genomic dna, under stringent hybridization conditions, using a  <dig> bp mtgs2a fragment corresponding to the beginning of the coding region, as a probe . restriction digestions of bac mth2-53e <dig>  containing the two mtgs <dig> genes were run in parallel for comparison. the expected hybridization fragments  were detected in both the bac and the genomic dna . two additional hybridizing fragments, corresponding to partial digestion of the gdna, of approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were detected after digestion with ecorv and ncoi, respectively .

comparison of the genomic sequences of the two genes revealed a high degree of homology both at the level of intron/exon organization and sequence conservation . the two genes are composed of  <dig> exons , interrupted by  <dig> introns . the start codon is located in the second exon and the stop codon in the last exon . the two genes are highly homologous. for the coding region the level of synonymous divergence per synonymous site  is  <dig>  and the level of non-synonymous divergence per non-synonymous site  is  <dig> . for the introns ks is  <dig> . the newly found gene contains the information to encode a functional gs <dig> protein with a calculated molecular weight  of  <dig> da, and theoretical isoelectric point  of  <dig>  . the deduced protein contains a target peptide and is predicted to be driven to the plastid . a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two m. truncatula gs <dig> polypeptides, reveals a high degree of homology . the existence of a second gs <dig> gene in the genome of medicago truncatula compels a redenomination of the previously identified mtgs <dig> gene , which will be referred from now on as mtgs2a, and designate the second gene as mtgs2b. the genes mtgs2a and mtgs2b are annotated in the genome as medtr2g <dig>  and medtr2g <dig> , respectively.

estimation of the time of the m. truncatula gs <dig> duplication event
the existence of a second gs <dig> gene in the genome of m. truncatula, located in the same chromosome and not too distant from the first gene suggests a recent duplication event. therefore the age of separation of different species of the vicioide subclade was estimated and these estimates used for dating the duplication event, assuming a molecular clock. furthermore, a search for the existence of a second gs <dig> gene in species where the duplication is expected to exist was performed.

estimates for the age of separation of different species can be obtained, assuming a molecular clock  <cit> , using the levels of synonymous divergence per synonymous site  for published chloroplast genes, and as calibration point the  <dig> my estimate for the split between pisum and albizia species  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the estimated ages  for the separation of four species  from m. truncatula is presented. m. truncatula and p. sativum are species diverging about  <dig>  my. using the silent site divergence at the coding region of mtgs2a between these two species , and the estimated age of  <dig>  my as calibration point, it is inferred that the medicago gs <dig> gene duplication  occurred about  <dig> my ago. therefore, taking into consideration the estimated ages for the separation of the different species from m. truncatula , the two genes are expected to be present in melilotus but not in more distantly related species. it is thus not surprising that a blastp of the l. japonicus  genome at  <cit> , using m. truncatula mtgs2a sequence  as a query, allows the detection of three gs genes . when these sequences together with m. truncatula gs <dig> and gs <dig> gene sequences are used to construct a phylogeny, the two first entries cluster with m. truncatula gs <dig> genes and the latter sequence clusters with m. truncatula gs <dig> gene . using the same methodology, l. japonicus is estimated to have diverged from m. truncatula about  <dig> my ago . it should be noted that, if a different calibration point is used, different ages will be obtained for the gene duplication and species divergence. nevertheless, our conclusion that this gene duplication is of a recent origin and should only be present in m. truncatula closely related species is valid.

average age
as a calibration point we used the  <dig> million years estimate for the split between pisum and albizia species  <cit>  and the levels of synonymous divergence per synonymous site  for the published chloroplast genes rbcl, matk and trnl of pisum sativum and three albizia species, namely the ks values of  <dig>  for p. sativum/a. julibrissin;  <dig>  for p. sativum/a. versicolor and  <dig>  for p. sativum/a. julibrissin, respectively.

to test the presence of the gs2b gene in melilotus species, primers have been designed for conserved regions in the coding sequences of gs <dig> genes from l. japonicas, p. sativum, phaseolus vulgaris, glycine max and the two m. truncatula gs <dig> genes . the ~  <dig> bp amplification product obtained using these primers and genomic dna of melilotus albus was cloned. two restriction patterns, which were called m. albus  <dig> and m. albus  <dig>  were revealed from the analysis of  <dig> colonies using two restriction enzymes. sequencing results revealed that m. albus  <dig> represent two types of sequences, called m. albus 2- <dig> and m. albus 2- <dig>  using blastn the three sequences revealed more than 95% similarity with m. truncatula mtgs2a coding region  and less than 75% similarity with the mtgs <dig> genes. therefore, the putative coding region of these sequences was annotated according to the medicago sequence. in these sequences there are five putative introns in the region analysed, with intron sizes similar to those observed in medicago . although the specific function of the melilotus albus gs2b genes can not be inferred from these studies, the region analysed suggests that they may be functional.

the phylogenetic relationship of the melilotus albus sequences and m. truncatula gs <dig> genes, using the coding region is presented in figure  <dig>  it should be noted that m. albus 2- <dig> and m. albus 2- <dig> sequences cluster with m. truncatula mtgs2b, with a strong bootstrap support. diversity levels between m. albus 2- <dig> and m. albus 2- <dig> at the coding region are ks =  <dig>  and ka =  <dig> . therefore, these sequences may represent two different gs2b genes in melilotus albus, from a very recent  duplication. m. albus  <dig> sequence does not cluster with strong support with both mtgs2a and mtgs2b gene sequences. to address if this sequence may represent the orthologue of m. truncatula mtgs2a gene the bayesian tree presented in figure  <dig> was constrained on having m. albus 2- <dig> and m. albus 2- <dig> and m truncatula mtgs2b sequences as one group, plus all other sequences as another group. when the difference of bayes factors between this tree and the unconstrained tree is calculated, a value of  <dig>  is obtained. it has been suggested that the constrained tree should be considered as significantly worse, only if twice this difference gives a number higher than  <dig>  <cit> . thus, the constrained tree is not significantly worse than the unconstrained one, and m. albus  <dig> sequence may represent the orthologue of m. truncatula mtgs2a gene.

isolation and characterization of two mtgs2b transcripts
to investigate whether mtgs2b is a functional gene, a thorough search for mtgs2b transcripts was performed in several organs of m. truncatula by rt-pcr. the high homology between the coding sequences of mtgs2b and the previously characterized mtgs2a, prevented the design of mtgs2b specific primers or probes. as an alternative approach, a set of primers that amplify both transcripts was used and the two transcripts were subsequently differentiated by restriction digestion of the pcr product by an enzyme that differentially cuts mtgs2b. this first approach pointed to a specific expression of mtgs2b in developing seeds . this tissue was thus used to isolate and sequence the 5'and 3' ends of mtgs2b mrnas by race. gene specific primers were designed for the poorly conserved 5' utr allowing subsequent cloning of mtgs2b cdnas. interestingly, two different mtgs2b transcripts of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were isolated and designated as mtgs2b-α and mtgs2b-β, respectively. the two transcripts were sequenced and found to be identical in their coding sequence and 3'utr, but different in the length and sequence of the 5'utr . sequence alignment of the two cdnas with the genomic dna indicates that the two transcripts arise from alternative splicing over the first intron. mtgs2b-α results from the retention of the first intron . as the position of the start codon is not altered, the two transcripts are predicted to encode a similar protein. the two mtgs2b mrna sequences have been posted in genbank, accession numbers hm <dig> and hm <dig> for mtgs2b-α and mtgs2b-β, respectively.

expression analysis of mtgs2b transcripts and proteins
the expression of mtgs2a and mtgs2b was evaluated by semi-quantitative rt-pcr using specific primers. to be able to distinguish mtgs2a and the two mtgs2b alternatively spliced transcripts, forward primers were designed to hybridize specifically in the non-conserved 5'utrs. these primers were used to amplify total rna isolated from several organs of the plant. the results are displayed as gel images and graphical representation of the amount of rna relative to the housekeeping gene elf1-α  .

mtgs2a transcripts were detected in almost all organs of the plant, being generally more highly expressed in green tissues  and poorly expressed in non-green tissues. interestingly and despite the nearly ubiquitous pattern of expression in green tissues, mtgs2a mrnas could not be detect in developing, green seeds , contrasting with the expression of both mtgs2b transcripts exclusively in these tissues. the mtgs2b expression signal detected in pods  is attributed to the green seeds contained inside the pod, as asserted by independent rt-pcr analyses of pod walls separated from green seeds .

the seed-specific nature of mtgs2b expression demanded an evaluation of its expression during seed development and in dissected seed tissues . semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed on total rna extracted from seeds collected at seven key developmental stages previously characterized at the physiological level  <cit> :  <dig> days after pollination  ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap   <dig> dap  and  <dig> dap  and from embryos, seed coat and endosperm dissected from  <dig> dap seeds. mtgs2a transcript levels remain roughly unaltered from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap  however, at  <dig> dap and thereafter, it seems to be absent  from developing seeds. in contrast, the two mtgs2b transcripts were detected in all developmental stages. the overall pattern of expression appears to be similar for the two mtgs2b alternatively spliced transcripts, with mtgs2b-α always being expressed at higher levels. although both transcripts seem to reach a maximum of accumulation at  <dig> dap , there was not a clear tendency to either decline or increase which may indicate that the levels are somehow constant during seed development. the tissue distribution of mtgs2b transcripts was also evaluated using dissected tissues from seeds collected at  <dig> dap: seed coat, endosperm and embryo . both mtgs2b transcripts were found to be present in the three major seed tissues with higher expression levels in the embryo. thus, from the two m. truncatula gs <dig> encoding genes, mtgs2b seems to be the most significant gs <dig> gene expressed in developing seeds, and the only gs <dig> gene expressed by the end of seed-filling and late maturation stages

to evaluate whether mtgs2b expression could be related to seed germination, the characterization of gs <dig> gene expression was extended to after-ripened seeds and to seeds after imbibition. both gs <dig> transcripts were detected only at basal levels in mature dry seeds and in seeds  <dig>  hours following imbibition . however  <dig> hours after seed imbibition, when the radicle was already visible, mtgs2b expression was undetectable. at this stage, a substantial increase in mtgs2a expression was observed  as previously reported to occur in m. truncatula during post-germinative growth  <cit> .

to correlate gs <dig> transcript levels with gs <dig> polypeptide content in developing seeds, protein extracts from five of the key developmental stages  and the three major dissected seed tissues , were subjected to sds-page followed by western blotting using a specific gs <dig> antibody. the small size of  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap seeds disallowed the collection of sufficient material to include in this analysis. gs <dig> polypeptide levels seem to increase during the course of seed development until the end of the seed-filling stage  with a significant decrease in abundance at  <dig> dap . although the anti-gs <dig> antibody cannot differentiate between the products of mtgs2a and mtgs2b, the polypeptides detected at  <dig> dap and afterwards are likely to result from mtgs2b expression, since mtgs2a transcripts are undetectable at these stages of development. gs <dig> was mostly abundant in the seed coat, however the embryo and the endosperm also contribute to the gs <dig> polypeptide content in  <dig> dap seeds . these results do not entirely reflect the transcription profile of the genes, indicating the existence of regulatory controls operating at a post-transcriptional level.

evaluation of the functionality of mtgs2b isoenzymes
mtgs2b contains the information to encode a functional protein quite similar to gs2a. a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two m. truncatula gs <dig> polypeptides, reveals a high degree of homology , with only  <dig> amino acid substitutions in a total of  <dig> residues . five of the amino acid substitutions are located in the n-terminal transit peptide and thus the mature protein is predicted to contain only  <dig> amino acid substitutions. gs2a and gs2b mature proteins are expected to have similar molecular masses, but different pis, of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. based on structural analysis  <cit> , five amino acid substitutions are predicted to be in positions that could affect gs activity.

to ensure that the protein encoded by the newly identified mtgs2b gene is catalytically functional, heterologous complementation assays were performed. the plant mtgs2b cdna was cloned, without the target peptide, into the e. coli expression vector ptrc99a, and introduced into the the e. coli glna mutant strain et <dig>  the previously described gs2a recombinant protein  <cit>  was used as positive control and the empty plasmid as a negative control. complementation, enabling growth on minimal media containing ammonium as the nitrogen source, was clearly observed for the two gs <dig> constructs whereas the bacteria transformed with the vector alone, could only grow in the presence of a glutamine supplement , indicating that gs2b is catalytically and physiologically active.

western blot analysis of total soluble protein extracts from the two different bacterial cultures  showed that the polypeptides are expressed in the bacterial host with the expected molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda. to compare the activity of the two proteins, gs activity assays were performed on total proteins extracted from the glna- strain grown in liquid m <dig> minimal medium plus iptg. gs activity determined by the transferase reaction was  <dig> times lower for gs2b relative to gs2a, while the synthetase activity was  <dig>  fold enhanced . this reflects striking differences in the kinetic properties of gs2b. several attempts were performed to express the protein gs2b with a 6×his tag in e. coli in order to purify the enzyme and determine kinetic parameters. all attempts were unsuccessful, despite the fact that the highly homologous gs2a can be easily expressed  <cit> , preventing further kinetic characterization of the enzyme.

discussion
m. truncatula is the first plant species in which a second gs <dig> gene has been detected. the gene is located on the same chromosome  as the previously characterized mtgs2a gene, only  <dig> kb apart, indicating a recent duplication event. gene duplicates provide an opportunity for functional innovation. mutations or genomic rearrangements altering when and where the duplicates are expressed, or the structure/function of the products encoded by the genes, can provide a selective advantage to the organism and be subsequently retained  <cit> . the newly identified mtgs2b gene, shows a seed specific expression and may represent a functional innovation of plastid located gs related to legume seed metabolism. this idea is reinforced by the presence of a second gs <dig> gene in a closely related species of the vicioide subclade . phylogenetic analysis estimated the age of the duplication event to have occurred  <dig> my ago, after legume speciation.

gs genes have been the subject of many molecular evolution studies, the gene is considered one of the oldest functioning genes  <cit> , and a good molecular clock  <cit> . phylogenetic studies have shown that chloroplastic and cytosolic gs genes have evolved through gene duplication. kumada et al.  <cit>  estimated the common ancestor of the two classes of genes to have duplicated about  <dig> my ago, before the monocot/dicot divergence. doyle  <cit>  proposed that members of the cytosolic gs gene family in plants have also evolved by duplication of a single, ancestral cytosolic gs gene and the evolution of separate gene copies to fulfil different metabolic cell requirements. a similar evolutionary process is conceivable for the plastid gs genes, the newly identified mtgs2b gene could have evolved to fulfil a specific metabolic role related to legume seed metabolism. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a duplication of a plastid located gene, and interestingly, the duplication seems to be quite recent in view of the estimation of the age of divergence of the cytosolic gs genes. studies in pinus sylvestris, estimate that the duplication of an ancestral cytosolic gs occurred long before the divergence of gymnosperms/angiosperms  <cit> .

an exceptional example of gene conversion has been proposed for the origin of the p. sativum cytosolic gs3a and gs3b twin genes  <cit> . the coding regions of plant gs genes are generally well conserved whereas the noncoding sequences are often very divergent, but the non-coding regions  of p. sativum cytosolic gs3a and gs3b twin genes are highly conserved. these two genes are located on separate loci in different chromosomes and gene conversion has been invoked as a possible mechanism for maintaining the high level of nucleotide similarity between the twin genes  <cit> . although the medicago truncatula mtgs2a and mtgs2b genes show a high degree of sequence conservation in both the coding and non-coding regions , the two genes are located in the same chromosome only  <dig> kb apart, compatible with an adjacent duplication event.

a surprising feature of mtgs2b expression is the fact that it is subjected to alternative splicing. alignment of the mrna sequences with the genomic sequence indicates that the alternative splicing occurs over the first intron, resulting in a longer 5' utr of alternatively spliced form α by retention of the first intron. intron retention is considered the prevalent mode of alternative splicing in plants  <cit> . in the case of mtgs2b, intron retention occurs on the 5' utr and does not affect the protein identity, but seems to be related to mrna stability and/or translation efficiency. leader introns have been reported to increase transcription and/or translation efficiencies of some plant genes. curi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the leader intron of a gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase in arabidopsis is responsible for increasing translation efficiency, besides being also responsible for the tissue-specific expression of the gene. another example is the 5'utr intron of rice polyubiquitin, which was found to be responsible for transcriptional, post-transcriptional enhancement and moderate increase in translation  <cit> . the two alternatively spliced mtgs2b transcripts show essentially the same pattern of expression during seed development , with the mtgs2b-α transcripts always being more abundant than those of mtgs2b-β. this suggests that either the excision of the first intron is inefficient, or that mechanisms exist so that mtgs2b-α mrna levels are maintained.

on the other hand, the steady state levels of the two mtgs2b mrnas do not always correlate with protein abundance. similarly, a recent study which compared the proteome and transcriptome of m.truncatula seeds revealed several proteins displaying a profile differing from that of the corresponding transcripts during seed development and in different seed tissues  <cit> . the abundance of mtgs2b-α transcripts seems to be inversely proportional to gs <dig> polypeptide abundance, most notorious at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, suggesting that the mtgs2b-α additional 5'utr intron functions to reduce mrna translation, as shown to occur for the chick proinsulin gene, where retention of a 5'utr intron leads to nearly complete translation blocking without affecting mrna stability or transport  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report of regulation of a gs gene by alternative splicing by intron retention in the 5' utr, but it is becoming increasingly evident that 5' introns can have a dramatic effect on gene expression in plants  <cit> .

the seed specific expression of the gene, strongly suggests a role related to seed metabolism. here, evidence is presented that the enzyme produced by mtgs2b is catalytically and physiologically active as it was able to rescue the phenotype of an e. coli glna mutant , but gs2b enzymatic activity presents distinctive features in relation to its homologue gs2a. although, we were unable to purify the protein, due to difficulties of expression in e. coli, activity tests performed on crude extracts, revealed significant differences in the kinetic activity of the two enzymes. the synthetase: transferase activity ratio of the new enzyme gs2b is surprisingly increased in relation to all the other medicago truncatula gs isoenzymes   <cit> . besides its biosynthetic reaction, gs catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine into glutamate and ammonia in the presence of the cofactors adp and pi. this reaction may be important in the production of ammonia and in providing glutamate for specific metabolic proposes. the unique synthetase to transferase gs activity ratio of this new gs <dig> isoenzyme, together with its seed specific expression is compatible with a specific function of the enzyme under a defined metabolic context exclusive to seed metabolism.

the difference in kinetic activity of the two m. truncatula gs <dig> isoenzymes is surprising in view of the high sequence similarity between the two gs polypeptides . however there are  <dig> differences between the two m. truncatula amino acid sequences with  <dig> of these being non-conservative. based on structural data  <cit>  it is predicted that most of the amino acid substitutions are not in positions critical for gs activity  except for residues i <dig>  g <dig> and k <dig>  these three sequential residues are particularly interesting since k <dig> integrates the gs conserved region iv defined by eisenberg et al.  <cit>  and known to participate in the active site. these three amino acid substitutions could be responsible for the particular gs synthetase to transferase ratio of gs2b.

at the initial stages of seed development both m. truncatula gs <dig> genes are simultaneously expressed, raising the question of whether mtgs2a and mtgs2b perform redundant roles in the seed or if mtgs2b acquired novel biochemical functions following gene duplication. the expression pattern of the two genes during seed development favours the second hypothesis. mtgs2b was found to be exclusively and continuously transcribed during seed development, whereas the expression of mtgs2a was down regulated at the onset of storage compound accumulation and reappears during post-germinative growth . the stronger and specific expression of mtgs2b during seed filling, strongly suggests that the enzyme performs a seed specific role related to reserve accumulation. in leaves, the main function of plastidic gs is the reassimilation of ammonia resulting from photorespiration  <cit> . it is unlikely that the enzyme performs a similar function in the seed, because seeds have low rubisco activity  <cit>  and low internal o <dig> levels, two conditions required for photorespiration to occur  <cit> . in roots, gs <dig> is mainly implicated in assimilating the ammonia derived from nitrate reduction  <cit> . this function is also unlikely for the seed gs <dig>  since the primary source of nitrogen available to the developing seeds is amino acids, mainly glutamine and asparagine  <cit> . a possible function for a plastid-located gs in legume seeds, and particularly during seed filling, would be n-remobilization from the amide amino acids, asparagine and glutamine to other amino acids required for storage-protein synthesis. the breakdown of asparagine is catalysed by asparaginase, which releases ammonia for reasssimilation via gs.

during the filling stage, seeds accumulate proteins, oils and carbohydrates to support seed germination and post-germinative growth  <cit> . m. truncatula produces protein-rich seeds  with high lipid  and low starch content   <cit> . some of these storage compounds are accumulated in the seed plastids, which perform specific metabolic features and undergo deep changes during seed development. m. truncatula possesses green embryos, and during seed development, the chloroplasts gradually differentiate into storage plastids  <cit> . photosynthesis has a low input to the overall carbon synthesis and seems to be mainly directed to oxygen and atp production to support the biosynthesis of storage compounds  <cit> . the plastid differentiation involves chlorophyll and photosynthetic machinery degradation and a plastidic glutamine synthetase could also be involved in the remobilization of nitrogen released during the degradation of the photosynthetic machinery.

the importance of seed plastid metabolism in the partitioning of assimilates into seed storage compounds, has been recently evidenced in several legumes. in vicia narbonensis, the antisense inhibition of the glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator, an importer of carbon to plastids, was found to reduce the levels of starch but to increase storage protein biosynthesis  <cit> . more recently, a pea 2-oxoglutarate/malate translocator  was also found to have a crucial role during seed storage. omt repression leads to reduced conversion of carbohydrates from sucrose to amino acids and proteins and delayed storage plastid differentiation. the authors emphasize that one of the probable causes of the phenotype displayed is the substrate limitation of plastidial gs/gogat cycle  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study shows that medicago truncatula contains an additional gs gene encoding a plastid located enzyme, which is functional and exclusively expressed during seed development. gs <dig> gene duplicates exist in a closely related species and it is estimated that the duplication event occurred around  <dig> my ago. the seed specific pattern of expression, together with the kinetic differences of this new isoenzyme in relation to the previously characterized mtgs2a, strongly suggests that the enzyme is performing a seed specific role related to storage protein accumulation. it is conceivable that the unique metabolism of legume seed plastids supplied the selective pressure for the unique expression and kinetic properties of this novel plastid located gs, in order to more efficiently support storage compound biosynthesis in m. truncatula.
