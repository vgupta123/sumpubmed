BACKGROUND
genes involved in reproduction and fertilization tend to evolve at faster rates than non-reproductive genes and it has been proposed that this rapid evolution is driven by positive darwinian selection  <cit> . mammalian sperm proteins have been extensively studied and they often show rapid divergence between closely related species  <cit> . the evolution of female reproductive proteins in vertebrate species has however received less attention, although evidence of positive selection has been provided for some female reproductive genes  <cit> . the precise nature of the selective pressures responsible for the accelerated evolution of reproductive genes are unknown, although plausible candidates include sexual selection, sexual conflict, and speciation reinforcement  <cit> . all three candidate evolutionary processes involve male-female interactions potentially manifested as sperm-egg interactions. so a way to test for these evolutionary processes is to compare patterns of evolution in genes involved in sperm-egg binding in  species, which differ with respect to sexual selection, sexual conflict or speciation reinforcement. for instance, in species with external fertilization, species recognition at the sperm-egg level should be more important than in species with internal fertilization, for which pre-fertilization mechanisms exist to avoid hybridisation. so if positive selection on reproductive genes is due to species recognition and hybridisation avoidance, then the signal of positive selection should be stronger in species with external fertilization than in species with internal fertilization. furthermore, if species recognition at the sperm-egg level is driving the evolution of the genes involved in sperm-egg binding, then highly species-specific binding of sperm to the egg should yield a stronger signal of positive selection than less species-specific binding.

as an illustration of this general approach for determining the nature of positive selection in reproductive genes, we have investigated the molecular evolution of the gene encoding zpc, the female reproductive glycoprotein zona pellucida c, in the three vertebrate groups of mammals, birds and fishes. the surface of the vertebrate oocyte is covered with an egg envelope, which is composed of several zona pellucida glycoproteins. zpc is involved in the binding of sperm to the egg in mammals and birds, after which the acrosome reaction is triggered  <cit> . in general, when egg and sperm come from different mammalian species, binding of sperm to the egg envelope does not occur, thus the binding is species-specific  <cit> . from studies of sperm-egg binding in species from the avian order galliformes  it appears that the binding is not species-specific  <cit> . as a consequence, sperm-egg interactions in birds do not represent such a stringent species-specific barrier as they do in mammals. the fertilization mechanism in fish is rather different from that in mammals and birds. most fish sperm lack an acrosome and penetrate the egg envelope via a discrete micropyle  <cit> . the function of the fish zpc homologue is not entirely known, but studies in medaka  suggest a function in guiding sperm to the micropyle, but it is unknown whether this process is species-specific.

in mammals, zpc has previously been shown to be evolving by positive selection  <cit> . by considering the evolution of zpc in birds and fishes as well as mammals we hoped to uncover variation in the levels of adaptive evolution among the three vertebrate groups. since the three groups differ in their fundamental reproductive biology, any differences in adaptive evolution should be informative with regard to the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. by combining sequences from public databases and our own sequencing efforts, we constructed separate alignments of the zpc coding sequence for  <dig> mammalian species,  <dig> avian species and six fish species. our principle method for inferring adaptive evolution from zpc sequence data was to apply lrts of codon based models, which allow among-site variation in selection pressures. these models permit the inference of positive selection at a small proportion of sites, so that the signal of positive selection is not swamped by the  much larger proportion of sites which are neutral or under negative selection. such lrts were used to demonstrate adaptive evolution of zpc in mammals. however, there has been recent concern over high rates of false inference of positive selection with lrts, particularly when applied to relatively small alignments with little sequence divergence  <cit> . therefore we used three different lrts and checked the evidence for positive selection by simulation studies.

RESULTS
overview of zpc divergence
using public available sequences and our own sequencing efforts, we produced three separate multiple species alignments of zpc coding sequences for  <dig> mammals,  <dig> birds and six fishes. the total lengths of the alignments, which do not include start or stop codons but which do include gaps, are  <dig> bp  for mammals,  <dig> bp  for birds, and  <dig> bp  for fishes. total tree length in substitutions per codon is  <dig>  for mammals,  <dig>  for birds,  <dig>  for fishes. thus there is relatively little sequence divergence in our sample of bird species compared to the other two groups of vertebrates.

we first analysed the zpc interspecies alignments assuming the m <dig> model of no variation in ω among codons. ω is the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio, also known as ka/ks or dn/ds, and is widely used as a measure of selective pressures on proteins assuming synonymous neutrality: ω< <dig> indicates negative selection, ω =  <dig> indicates neutrality, and ω> <dig> indicates positive selection. average ω is  <dig>  for mammals,  <dig>  for birds and  <dig>  for fishes. these low values indicate that the predominant mode of selection on the zpc is purifying selection, and are consistent with the finding that domains within the zpc gene are very well conserved across vertebrates  <cit> . thus the m <dig> model of no variation in ω among codons gives no indication that zpc is evolving unusually rapidly at the protein level.

likelihood ratio tests of positive selection
lrts of positive selection compare the fit of two nested models to the sequence data; a null model without adaptive evolution and an alternative model with adaptive evolution. both models may invoke variation in ω among codons, but the null model is restricted to ω less than or equal to one, whereas the alternative model allows adaptive evolution with ω> <dig>  if the alternative model provides a significantly better fit to the data then adaptive evolution is inferred. we considered three different lrts, three different pairs of null and alternative models: m1a-m2a, m7-m <dig>  m8a-m <dig> .

for birds, inferences of rare and weak positive selection are obtained for both the m2a  and m <dig>  models, although the chi-square approximations indicate no significant improvement in fits for alternative over null models .

for fishes, the m2a model gives very little indication of positive selection , and the tiny increase in likelihood from m1a to m2a is not remotely significant . the m <dig> model indicates that 24% of codons are subject to moderate positive selection . as with mammals the chi-square approximation indicates a significant improvement in fit for the m <dig> model over the m <dig> model . for the m8a-m <dig> comparison, the chi-square approximation indicates a non-significant improvement in fit .

simulation studies
the lrt analyses show that the three different lrts give rather different views of positive selection in zpc. the m1a-m2a test gives no indication of adaptive evolution in any of the three vertebrate groups. the situation is similar for the m8a-m <dig> test, although the result in mammals is at least suggestive. in contrast, the m7-m <dig> test gives highly significant evidence of adaptive evolution in mammals and fishes, and even though the m7-m <dig> lrt is not significant in birds the m7-m <dig> test gives the lowest p value of the three tests.

how can we explain the differences among the lrts? there are a number of possible explanations:  there is no adaptive evolution in zpc in vertebrates, and the chi-square approximation is biased to give false positives for the m7-m <dig> test ;  there is no adaptive evolution in zpc in vertebrates, and the m7-m <dig> test is biased to give false positives because it is not robust to the complex patterns of non-adaptive evolution in zpc ; and  there is adaptive evolution, and the m7-m <dig> test has greater power to reveal adaptive evolution than the other two tests. we performed simulations to examine these alternative explanations.

to test explanation  we performed parametric bootstrapping to check the chi-square approximation to the likelihood ratio statistic . we performed parametric bootstrapping with  <dig> simulated data sets for the three lrts in both mammals and fishes. in each case we found a good correspondence between the p value for the null model obtained by parametric bootstrapping and the p value obtained by the chi-square approximation . there seems to be no reason to suggest that any biases in the chi-square approximation could have generated the m7-m <dig> evidence of adaptive evolution, i.e. the p values obtained by parametric bootstrapping for the m7-m <dig> tests remain significant.

to test explanation  we performed simulations to check the robustness of the three lrts to complex patterns of non-adaptive evolution as captured by the m8a model . the p values for the robustness simulations in table  <dig> indicate the probability of obtaining the observed lrt results where the data generated under the m8a model. if the lrts are unbiased then this p value should be similar to the chi-square p value, but if a lrt is biased to give false positives then we would expect an increase from the chi-square p value to the robustness p value. we find strong evidence of a bias affecting the m7-m <dig> lrt: for both mammals and fishes the observed findings of positive selection could easily have been generated by the non-adaptive m8a model of codon evolution. in contrast the m8a-m <dig> test seems unbiased while the m1a-m2a test appears a little conservative.

to test explanation  we looked at the relative powers of the lrts using simulations with a weakly selected positive selection class . power was measured as the proportion of the  <dig> data sets for which the lrt, as assessed by the chi-square approximation, gave a significant result with p <  <dig> . the power of the m1a-m2a test was only 12%, much lower than the 54% power achieved by the m8a-m <dig> test, while the m7-m <dig> test has the greatest power of 88%.

tests of positive selection in birds using polymorphism data
the fact that the total tree length of the avian multiple species alignment is relatively small means that methods using just inter-species divergence to infer positive selection are expected to lack power  <cit> . therefore to study the evolution of avian zpc in more detail we also performed various tests of positive selection making use of additional polymorphism data. the total number of segregating sites in the  <dig> chicken chromosomes was  <dig>  of which  <dig> were intronic and  <dig> exonic, of which  <dig> were nonsynonymous and  <dig> synonymous. tests based on allele frequency spectra failed to show significant deviations from neutrality or any evidence of recent selective sweeps. tajima's d statistic was non-significantly positive , while the h test revealed a non-significant excess of high frequency alleles . the hka test was performed to test for heterogeneity between the ratio intraspecific variation in chicken and interspecific divergence with the turkey outgroup in zpc against a reference set of autosomal data from sundstrom et al.  <cit> .

the reference set contained only intronic sites, so only intronic sites in zpc were considered. the hka test did not show significant deviation from neutrality . the nucleotide diversity in zpc introns, θπ, is  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  higher by a factor of  <dig>  than the average for several other intronic loci sequenced in the same individuals   <cit> . the relative increase in polymorphism is very nearly matched by the relative increase in divergence: the zpc chicken-turkey intronic divergence of  <dig>  is higher by a factor of  <dig>  than the average of  <dig>  from the study of sundstrom et al.  <cit> . the mcdonald-kreitman test was performed to compare the nonsynonymous over synonymous ratio between divergence and polymorphism. for chicken polymorphism there were  <dig> nonsynonymous and  <dig> synonymous changes, while for divergence the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes down the chicken lineage were estimated by paml to be  <dig> and  <dig>  thus there is a signal of positive selection, i.e. a relative excess of nonsynonymous divergence, but it is not significant .

discussion
we have tested for signals of positive selection in the evolution of the zpc gene in mammals, birds and fishes. the three different lrts yielded some conflicting results , with the only two significant findings of positive selection both obtained using the m7-m <dig> test. the parametric bootstrapping simulations showed that this discrepancy between the lrts was not due to biases in the chi-square approximation to the likelihood ratio statistic. the power simulations showed that the m7-m <dig> test is more powerful at detecting low levels of weak positive selection than the two other lrts , but the robustness simulations showed that the m7-m <dig> test is biased towards false positives under patterns of non-adaptive evolution like those fitted by the m8a model to the zpc gene. the bias in the m7-m <dig> test revealed by the robustness simulations was not apparent for the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> tests, and this difference seems to provide the most likely explanation for our results: the highly significant m7-m <dig> results could have been generated by the bias in the test in the absence of adaptive evolution.

thus we have no strong evidence of adaptive evolution in zpc in vertebrates, with the best evidence being the suggestive p value of  <dig>  for the m8a-m <dig> lrt on the mammalian sequence data. the use of avian polymorphism data in addition to interspecies data also failed to reveal significant evidence of positive selection.

our results have some important methodological implications. the potential bias of the m7-m <dig> test has been suggested as a theoretical possibility by swanson et al.  <cit> , who pointed out that if the beta distribution on its own  fits the data poorly, then the m7-m <dig> test may generate a high proportion of significant tests even in the absence of positive selection. as far as we know, our robustness simulations provide the first demonstration of the m7-m <dig> bias for real data. the beta distribution is a natural distribution for modelling the variation in ω between  <dig> and  <dig> , but a single beta distribution cannot provide a good fit when the real data have a bimodal distribution with two peaks, one located at ω =  <dig> and the other at an intermediate ω above  <dig> but less than  <dig> . thus the addition of an extra ω class in the m <dig> model is likely to give a large increase in likelihood, and if the position of the ω =  <dig> peak is overestimated at all then positive selection will be inferred.

we tested these ideas of why the m7-m <dig> lrt can lead to an excess of false positives by performing some additional robustness simulations under simple codon models. in all other respects except the ω distribution our set of  <dig> replicates was generated with the same parameters as the 5-taxon tree datasets detailed in wong et al.  <cit> . the simulated ω distribution was 40% ω =  <dig>  40% ω =  <dig>  and 20% ω =  <dig> . in  <dig> out of  <dig> replicates the m7-m <dig> test gave a false positive result at the 5% level using the chi-square method, and six replicates gave a false positive result at the 1% level. so these robustness simulations confirm that the m7-m <dig> test can be biased under fairly simple scenarios. since the scenario we have simulated seems biologically reasonable, i.e. a combination of some sites under very strong negative selection, some sites under moderate negative selection, and a small proportion of sites evolving neutrally, we believe that evidence of adaptive evolution obtained with the m7-m <dig> lrt alone should be treated with caution.

we also considered the performance of the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> lrts for the same simulated data, which led to an excess of false positives with the m7-m <dig> test. in none of the  <dig> replicates did the m1a-m2a test give a false positive result at the 5% level, indicating a conservative test. for the m8a-m <dig> test the levels of false positives were slightly elevated above expectations with nine false positives at the 5% level and two false positives at the 1% level, but these levels are reasonably close to null expectations. thus the choice between the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> lrts can be seen as a tradeoff: the m8a-m <dig> test has greater power but also a greater risk of false positives.

we should emphasize the importance of distinguishing between problems with specific lrts and the general approach using lrts to test for adaptive evolution by comparing the likelihoods of different models of ω variation among codons. our robustness simulations indicate that the m7-m <dig> lrt tends to produce false positives in the absence of adaptive evolution. such a failure of a specific lrt does not mean that the general approach of lrts is wrong, just that certain lrts may fail under certain conditions. the more we know about how genes evolve the better we will be able to design models of among site variation in ω.

one final methodological point concerns the effects of changes in the size of the dataset. in a preliminary version of this study we considered a more limited dataset of just four fish species. for this dataset we obtained significant results of p =  <dig>  for the m1a-m2a lrt and p =  <dig>  for the m8a-m <dig> lrt. the addition of two more species  increased the m1a-m2a p value to  <dig>  and the m8a-m <dig> p value to  <dig> . these two species only increased total length slightly from  <dig>  to  <dig> , so it is surprising that they had such a large effect on the m8a-m <dig> test. it seems likely that small datasets are likely to lead imprecise maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, particularly when fitting parameter rich codon models. such concerns may be addressed by using bayesian approaches to the inference of adaptive evolution,  <cit>  which should account for parameter uncertainty.

CONCLUSIONS
so as far as biological conclusions go, we have no strong evidence of adaptive evolution in zpc in vertebrates. this result obviously means that we cannot use comparative methods to analyse the selective causes of adaptive evolution in zpc. our study does however raise some interesting methodological issues, in particular we show that the patterns of evolution in the zpc gene cause the m7-m <dig> lrt to be heavily biased towards false inference of adaptive evolution. thus we urge caution in the use of the m7-m <dig> lrt, and would suggest the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> lrts as more reliable tests of adaptive evolution. much of the evidence for pervasive adaptive evolution in reproductive proteins has been obtained using the m7-m <dig> lrt and our study raises the issue of whether these findings are genuine.
