BACKGROUND
the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor  gene family encodes major histocompatibility complex  class i specific receptors that are expressed on natural killer  and t cells  <cit> . in humans, these are encoded within the leukocyte receptor complex   <cit>  on chromosome 19q <dig> , which like the mhc on chromosome 6p <dig> , is a region characteristic of immune loci: highly plastic, polygenic, polymorphic, rapidly evolving, and associated with disease  <cit> . as a result, kir diversity contributes vital variability to our immune system with direct implications for health and disease  <cit> . kir working in concert with its human leukocyte antigen  ligands has been shown to influence directly the resolution of viral infections such as hepatitis c virus  <cit> .

numerous kir genes, both in their activating and inhibitory forms, have been identified in all primates examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving  <cit> . inhibitory kir have longer cytoplasmic tails in comparison to activating kir, and typically contain two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs  which are responsible for repressing the immunoreactivity of nk cells. the emergence of primate activating kirs can be accounted by two processes: the alteration in the length and sequence of the cytoplasmic tail in an ancestral long-tailed kir to eliminate the itims, accompanied by nucleotide changes in the transmembrane  domain to introduce a charged residue  <cit> . another distinguishing feature of kir molecules is the number of extracellular immunoglobulin  domains, numbered d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  although kir2dl <dig> is conserved in all primates studied to date  <cit> , it is unlikely to represent the ancestral kir gene. structurally, kir2dl <dig> has a d0+d <dig> organisation and has arisen by exon loss from a three ig-containing progenitor. the itims present in the cytoplasmic tail are also not conserved between all primates: monkeys have two, apes have only one, and in some cases, the motif has diverged from the consensus   <cit> . kir2dl <dig> has a charged amino acid in the tm region, and in this respect, could act as an activating kir  <cit> . it binds the non-polymorphic hla-g molecule, and this may explain why this gene has remained relatively unchanged since the last common ancestor. here we report a novel lineage  and show it to be divergent to the previously identified lineages and conserved throughout  <dig> million years of primate evolution. characteristics that would be expected to be present in the common ancestral primate kir, such as three ig domains, a long cytoplasmic tail, and two itims providing an inhibitory function, are all present in the kir3dl <dig> lineage. for the purpose of this report, we define 'ancestral' as the phylogenetically most diverged gene. in support of this discovery, we present genomic, cdna, expression and phylogenetic data.

RESULTS
identification of the kir3dl <dig> locus
although still located within the lrc  <cit> , the human kir3dl <dig> locus maps approximately  <dig> kb centromeric to the known kir cluster . this location in between the two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor  clusters may explain why this gene has escaped discovery for so long. despite its location outside of the kir cluster, kir3dl <dig> is clearly more related phylogenetically to kir genes than to any other ig-containing gene within the lrc .

all kir family members share a comparable gene structure; discrete exons encode the signal peptide, either two or three extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a stem, transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. as we show below, the genomic sequence for kir3dl <dig> is characteristic of kir and highly conserved in all primates , but, in human, a single deletion of seven nucleotides at the end of the third immunoglobulin domain  in exon  <dig> leads to a frameshift, preventing it from being expressed on the cell surface. because of the deletion, it uses alternative reading frames for the end of exon  <dig> and exons 6/ <dig>  resulting in a potentially secreted form of kir3dl <dig> with no tm and cytoplasmic domains. the only possibility of the kir3dl <dig> receptor remaining membrane-bound would be an association with the adaptor molecule dap <dig> mediated by a charged amino acid in the tm. dap <dig> is able to stimulate cytotoxic activity as it contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and is the mode in which activating kirs have an effect. although the frameshift has resulted in the presence of a charged amino acid  in the terminal exon , the deduced amino acid sequence does not correspond to a tm or core hydrophobic region, which makes the association with dap <dig> less likely in this case. human kir3dl <dig> is based on a full-length cdna isolated from a human nk cell line , and is further supported by a partial cdna sequence  from the mammalian gene collection , isolated from a different human nk cell line . in order to check for polymorphism,  <dig> unrelated healthy individuals were sequenced across the deleted region and the same frameshift causing deletion was present in all individuals.

the relatedness of kir3dl <dig> to the kir gene family is further confirmed by gene structure analyses. using finex, a method that identifies gene families based on the conservation of gene structure  rather than sequence similarity  <cit> , the closest relative of kir3dl <dig> is the prototypical human kir gene kir3dl <dig> with a significant z-score of + <dig>  . furthermore, using vista  <cit> , a global genomic comparison tool, significant conservation in both coding and non-coding sequences is present between all primate kir3dl <dig> sequences and kir3dl <dig> .

conservation of kir3dl <dig> in primates
we show kir3dl <dig> to be highly conserved in primates with the identification of orthologues in the common chimpanzee , gorilla , rhesus monkey  and common marmoset . the two copies in marmoset are arranged in a head-to-head orientation and are likely to be the result of a species-specific duplication event. these non-human primates diverged from humans approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, respectively. in all cases, kir3dl <dig> maps to the syntenic region between lair <dig> and lilra <dig>  details of the genomic lrc organization in these primates will be described elsewhere.

the primate kir3dl <dig> sequences share the same exon-intron configuration and are predicted to encode functional proteins . in addition to the human cdna, full length cdna sequences were isolated from chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. variations between the genomic and cdna sequences may indicate kir3dl <dig> to be polymorphic. although only two sequences could be compared per species, we identified five non-synonymous substitutions in chimpanzee and one synonymous substitution in human. the conservation of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, present in the cytoplasmic tail of the predicted kir3dl <dig> protein sequences from all species studied, indicates an inhibitory function for these receptors. these motifs are present in only one copy in marmoset, which has the complete nine-exon gene structure. the short form is missing the last three exons encoding the tm and cytoplasmic domains, resulting in a potentially secreted form, which is similar, but not identical, to the kir3dl <dig> cdna in human . while three n-linked glycosylation sites  are conserved in the majority of the sequences analyzed, one additional site is present in the igd <dig> of the two kir3dl <dig> copies in marmoset. for the short marmoset form in particular, the extra glycosylation site increases the potential level of glycosylation. high levels of glycosylation have been shown to be essential for secretion of some immunoglobulins  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
the kir genes identified to date have been divided into five distinct lineages  <cit> : lineage i comprises genes with specific domain configurations , lineage ii is defined by ligand specificity , lineage iii contains a mixture of kir genes with two or three ig domains, lineage iv genes are only found in rhesus monkeys, and lineage v encompasses kir genes lacking the stem. having established that kir3dl <dig> is conserved across species at the gene and protein levels , all kir3dl <dig> domains clustered at the base of the kir clade, separated from the lilr domains . the igd <dig> domain of kir3dl <dig> is more closely related to the igd <dig> domains of the kir gene family  in comparison to all other domains used in the analysis.

expression profiles
we confirmed expression of kir3dl <dig> by cdna cloning in human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. the human cdna was cloned from an nk cell line , and preliminary analysis shows expression in five other nk cell lines but not in jurkat cells  . to evaluate the pattern of expression in more detail, we chose the rhesus monkey. peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were obtained and nkp46+ cells, previously shown to be enriched for nk cytolytic activity  <cit> , were isolated by immunoaffinity methods. firstly, using rt-pcr, a  <dig>  kb cdna was identified that encodes a protein with  <dig> amino acids, and verifies the in-silico structure of primate kir3dl <dig>  a second fragment was also observed and represents an alternative splice form missing exon 5; this variant has only two ig domains. secondly, levels of kir3dl <dig> mrna in these cell populations were quantified by a real time rt-pcr assay. in view of data indicating that il- <dig> can increase expression of kirs, rhesus nkp46+ cells were also cultured in the presence of recombinant human il- <dig> for one week, and tested for kir3dl <dig> mrna expression at the end of this period. as shown in figure  <dig>  levels of kir3dl <dig> message were modestly enriched in nkp46+ cells compared to unfractionated pbmc for the three rhesus monkeys tested, although the relatively low number of copies per nkp46+ cell suggests that the receptor may be expressed by only a subset of nkp46+ cells. culture in the presence of il- <dig> resulted in substantial upregulation of expression of kir3dl <dig> in cells from all three animals.

CONCLUSIONS
based on comparative sequence analysis, we have identified a new lineage of immunoglobulin receptors and show them to be part of the kir receptor family, supported by four independent lines of evidence.  sequence similarity: using the blast algorithm, the similarity on both the dna and protein level is highest to kir.  gene structure similarity: the nine exon gene structure and the phases of the splice site boundaries are identical or more similar to kir than to any other gene family.  phylogenetics: full length and domain-by-domain phylogenetic analysis cluster the new sequences with high confidence at the base of the kir clade.  expression: cdna cloning and quantitative rt-pcr analysis demonstrate an expression profile typical of kir. while the data presented here suggest 3dl <dig> to be the ancestral kir gene in primates, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection to have caused the observed divergence. the situation in non-primates remains unclear. based on our own and previously reported phylogenetic evidence  <cit> , the primordial non-primate kir gene would be predicted to be a three-ig inhibitory receptor, most similar to kir3dl <dig>  yet, we were unable to find any significant matches to kir3dl <dig> in non-primates, except to previously reported sequences  <cit>  that have higher similarity to more recent kirs. recently, a cluster of chir genes has been identified in chicken, but these resemble the organisation of two-domain kirs  <cit> . a possible explanation for these observations is that kir3dl <dig> has been lost from non-primate genomes. polyphyletic loss of multiple human genes from non-primate vertebrate genomes has been observed before and has led to the suggestion that such events are more frequent than previously thought  <cit> . both rapid and convergent evolution have probably contributed to or even driven this process. in rodents, for instance, multiple ly <dig> genes, which encode c-type lectins, carry out the kir analogous function. the two murine kirl <dig> and kirl <dig> genes  <cit>  lack the characteristic activating/inhibitory motifs of kirs and map to the x chromosome outside the otherwise conserved lrc. likewise, the single kir-like sequence in rat   <cit>  lacks the stem region and has an elongated tm region. the sequence has, however, the same overall  structure as kir3dl <dig> and maps to the syntenic region in the rat lrc and, in this respect, represents the closest non-primate relative to kir3dl <dig>
