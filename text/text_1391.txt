BACKGROUND
chestnuts are members of the fagaceae family, comprised of about  <dig> species of trees and shrubs including other dominant northern hemisphere temperate forest trees such as oaks and beeches  <cit> . many members of this family are subject to significant biotic stresses, particularly from fungal and fungal-like diseases. examples include phytophthora cinnamomi, an oomycete that attacks hundreds of plant species around the world including both oaks and chestnuts  <cit> , and phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death, a disease currently devastating oaks in western north america  <cit> . rapid climate change and alien pathogen introduction have substantially increased the need for genetic tools to insure conservation and improvement of tree resources to meet future environmental challenges. a case in point, the american chestnut , was eliminated as a dominant eastern us forest tree species during the first half of the 20th century due an introduced fungal pathogen   <cit> . utilizing the natural resistance of chinese chestnut  to the blight, chestnut breeding programs have for decades been working to produce a tree of primarily american chestnut genetic background with blight resistance  <cit> . to assist the breeding efforts and to enable future genetic research in chestnut, an extensive genomic tool development initiative for chinese chestnut was undertaken, resulting in an integrated set of resources including transcriptome sequences  <cit> , a dense genetic map  <cit> , bac libraries and a genetically anchored physical map  <cit> . these genomic tools create a powerful platform for trait mapping, applied breeding and comparative genomics.

comparative genomics affords the opportunity to increase our understanding of the common underlying gene networks and molecular mechanisms of forest tree defense responses that may be conserved among plant species, especially close relatives suffering from similar diseases. however, in deciduous trees, we have limited knowledge of the degree of preservation of the structural organization of the genomes among either close or distantly related species. with the increase in genetic and genomic resources in some key forest and fruit trees species, we are now positioned to comparatively examine the extent of genome preservation at both low and high resolution among these species. these comparisons provide the opportunity to assess the ability to leverage the genomic information from highly characterized plant genomes for application in other less well-characterized species.

the physically mapped, genetically anchored est sequence markers from the chinese chestnut genetic map and the chinese chestnut bac end sequences  spanning the physical map provide ideal substrates for genome comparisons with other tree species with highly characterized genomes at the sequence level, such as peach  and poplar . identified conserved syntenic blocks in these genomes could assist in candidate gene discovery when coupled with chestnut trait mapping efforts. furthermore, these genomic comparisons provide a first low-resolution glimpse of the extent of genome change that has proceeded since the split of the families. however, to utilize comparative approaches with completely sequenced and assembled tree reference genomes as a means to identify potential candidate genes in marked intervals of less well sequence characterized species, we need to access the degree of preservation among tree genomes at a high resolution level, e.g. within  <dig> centimorgan  windows.

in order to gain both a low and a high resolution comparative picture of the extent genome change between chestnut and other completely sequenced and assembled plant species genomes, we carried out comparative genome analyses utilizing bac end sequences representing the physical map minimal tiling path and genetically anchored est sequences in chestnut against completely sequenced and assembled genomes of angiosperm plant species of both phylogenetically close and distant relationships to chestnut. after completing this low-resolution comparative analysis, we were interested in assessing whether at high resolution the genome structural comparative relationships would be similar or different. therefore, we carried out a comparative analysis between sequences of three regions of the chinese chestnut genome that contain qtls for chestnut blight resistance  <cit>  with other plant genomes. these sequences were mapped to a number of completely sequenced plant genomes to examine the extent of genome preservation for these regions among diverse plant species. in addition to enabling us to evaluate the extent of preservation of the defined regions of the chestnut genome to other species, these sequences also provided genes to advance the study of the molecular underpinnings of blight resistance in chinese chestnut as well as a set of markers for use in marker assisted breeding efforts.

in both the low and high resolution comparative analyses, we demonstrate that the peach genome is the best current reference model for chestnut, however surprisingly the grape genome is the second most highly similar genome in this study. additionally, the comparative sequence analyses for the chestnut blight qtls enabled us to define in high resolution the degree of gene preservation within the two chestnut qtls that were previously found to overlap with mapped qtls for powdery mildew resistance in peach, as reported by  <cit> , suggesting that these regions might be important in generalized resistance to fungal pathogens. the combination of low and high resolution mapping of genomic sequence data provided in this report suggests that key high quality sequenced woody species genomes could serve as repositories of gene information for candidate gene studies in other related tree species with less well characterized genomes.

RESULTS
alignments of integrated physical and genetic map to reference genomes
significant improvements have been made to the integrated physical and genetic map since their publication  <cit> . an additional  <dig> overgo probes have been successfully placed on the physical map, bringing the total overgo probes to  <dig> . the total number of physical map contigs is  <dig>  a slight reduction from the previous version. the new probes were designed from chinese chestnut est sequences that contain genetic map markers in order to create more links between the physical and genetic maps. this version of the physical map is available on the hardwood genomics web as version  <dig>  <cit> . the new probes hybridized to an average of  <dig>  bac clones each, slightly lower than the previously reported average of  <dig> . because the bacs included in the physical map represent 18x genome equivalents, this suggests that the majority of probes are hybridizing to a single genomic location. less than  <dig> % of probes  hybridized to more than  <dig> clones; those that did are likely repetitive sequences in the genome. more than  <dig> % of probes  hybridized to one or two assembled contigs in the physical map. this confirms that most unique genomic locations have been assembled into physical map contigs, yielding accurate links from a genetic map location to a physical map location.

of the  <dig>  overgo probes,  <dig>  originated from an est contig also used to develop one or more genetic map markers, thereby allowing an association from the overgo probe to a linkage group. of these overgo probes,  <dig> are associated with both a linkage group and a cm position from the consensus genetic map. the latter set of markers was uploaded into the fpc software as framework markers and placed using the fpc ctg - > chr algorithm. this resulted in the placement of  <dig> physical map contigs to linkage group locations. the  <dig> anchored physical map contigs span an estimated  <dig> mb and represent  <dig>  % of the total physical map span. a further  <dig> contigs are anchored to a single genetic marker by only  <dig> bac hybridization, and the bac marker had stronger hybridization signals to a different physical map contig. these contigs are not considered anchored but are noted in the fpc file. the algorithm found  <dig> contigs to contain strong overgo links to more than one genetic map location, and these also were not considered anchored. these contigs may be incorrectly assembled or the probes may actually reside at multiple locations in the genome.

in addition to the use of overgo probes, the physical map has been enhanced through bac-end sequencing. forward and reverse end-sequencing was carried out on a subset of the clones in the map assembly, resulting in  <dig>  sequences . part of this bes subset was the  <dig>  bacs spanning the qtl regions of the genome; the rest were selected based on physical map spacing, with an effort to obtain evenly spaced sequences spanning all contigs. the sequences include  <dig> , <dig> bases. this represents  <dig>  % of the chestnut genome, estimated to be  <dig> mb  <cit> . the bac library cmcmbb contained  <dig>  of the bac end sequences, of which  <dig>  bacs had both uccessful forward and reverse sequences, creating a linked pair. the library cmcmbd had  <dig>  bes and  <dig>  successful bac end sequence pairs.

the integrated physical and genetic map is a powerful genomic tool for targeted sequencing as well as comparison to other plant genomes. using the bes spanning the physical map and the genetically-anchored est-derived overgo probes, the software symap was used to align the fpc contigs to the sequenced genomes of peach, strawberry, soybean, medicago, poplar, papaya, arabidopsis, eucalyptus, grape and tomato. peach and strawberry are members of the rosales order, and they are the phylogenetically the closest examined relatives to the chestnut, which is in the fagales order. soybean, medicago and poplar are members of the fabidae/rosid i clade, in orders more distant from fagales. arabidopsis, eucalyptus and papaya fall into the sister malvidae/rosid ii group. grape is a core eudicot that is classified as an outgroup to all rosids. the furthest species from chestnut phylogenetically is tomato, a member of the asterids  <cit> .

the chestnut genome aligned best to the peach genome in overall percentage by a slight margin over grape . of the  <dig> physical map contigs,  <dig> aligned to the peach genome. when a set of physical map contigs were sequentially anchored across a chestnut linkage group and also sequentially aligned to a peach chromosome location, they were placed into a putative syntenic block . a total of  <dig> such syntenic blocks were created based on  <dig>  bes and  <dig> bes alignments between the genomes. when measured against the peach genome,  <dig> blocks spanned over  <dig> mb,  <dig> blocks spanned  <dig> to  <dig> mb and  <dig> blocks spanned less than  <dig> mb. about  <dig> % of the chestnut physical map span was contained in syntenic blocks as measured in consensus band units. the blocks covered  <dig> % of the peach genome. some genomic segments unique in one species mapped to two segments in the other genome. the chestnut physical map had  <dig> % double coverage of the peach, while the peach genome double covered  <dig> % of the chestnut genome.fig.  <dig> alignments from chestnut to other plant genomes. symap predicted alignments of the integrated chestnut genetic and physical map to the reference genomes of ten plant species with reference genome sequences. the species range broadly in phylogenetic position relative to chestnut; the relative phylogenetic position of the species is represented at the top of the table  <cit> . the locations of predicted whole genome duplication events  during rosid evolution are marked with stars. all marked duplications were tetraploidizations except for the paleo hexaploidy event γ  which is ancestral to the rosid/asterid split  <cit>  and a later triplication of the solanum lineage, impacting the tomato genome  <cit> . the α and β wgds identified in arabidopsis  <cit>  occurred in the brasicales lineage, but neither are shared with papaya  <cit> . the eucalyptus and poplar genomes have undergone an additional wgd event not shared with other species used in the analysis  <cit> . the papilionoids underwent a wgd that is shared by soybean and medicago, but a more recent wgd event occurred in the soybean lineage  only  <cit> .a the number of chestnut marker alignments to the other genome used in construction of predicted syntenic blocks. b the number of chestnut bes alignments to the other genome used in construction of a predicted syntenic blocks. c the percent of the chestnut physical map aligned to at least one location in the other genome, measured in consensus band units. d the percent of the chestnut physical map aligned to two or more locations in the other genome, measured in consensus band units. e the percent of the other genome aligned to at least one chestnut physical map contig, measured in bases. f the percent of the other genome aligned to two or more chestnut physical map contigs, measured in bases



despite being phylogenetically distant to chestnut compared to peach and other species in the analysis, the same percent of the chestnut genome,  <dig> %, aligned to grape as to peach. the grape comparison also yielded the second highest number of aligned chestnut physical map contigs,  <dig>  the genome organization of chestnut to poplar was also surprisingly conserved with  <dig> % of the chestnut genome aligning into  <dig> large syntenic blocks. the recent whole genome duplication in poplar is evident, with  <dig> % of the chestnut genome aligning to the poplar genome in two locations. the chestnut regions with synteny to two populus chromosomes often correspond to the regions of poplar known to have arisen from the wgd  <cit>  . this double coverage in poplar is  <dig> times more extensive than the  <dig> and  <dig> % double coverage that was detected with peach and grape, respectively. the syntenic blocks between poplar and chestnut were larger than the syntenic blocks found for peach, an expected outcome given that poplar has a larger genome. of the syntenic blocks found between poplar and chestnut,  <dig> blocks were over  <dig> mb in length,  <dig> blocks ranged in length from  <dig> mb to  <dig> mb, and  <dig> blocks were less than  <dig> mb. less conservation of synteny was observed with the other species studied, with less than  <dig> % of the chestnut genome aligning to the medicago, papaya, arabidopsis and tomato genomes .fig.  <dig> location of predicted syntenic genome blocks. conserved blocks determined by the symap software from each chestnut linkage group to the ten aligned species are illustrated by colored blocks



some physical map contigs consistently aligned. twelve physical map contigs aligned to all ten comparison species. six of these  <dig> contigs corresponded to the qtl contigs, which were preferentially saturated with overgo markers and bes . the  <dig> contigs that aligned to all of the reference genomes studied were both significantly longer than the average physical map contig  and contained more overgo markers . due to the overgo probes being predominantly est-based, these contigs may represent gene rich regions and contain less repetitive sequence. it is possible that these regions retained conserved genomic structure on a macrosytentic scale across dicots.

qtl sequences
the chestnut genetic linkage map was initially constructed by kubisiak et al.  <cit>  from an f <dig> family of an american x chinese chestnut cross using rflps and rapds  <cit> . inoculation and phenotyping of the plants were carried out to identify qtls conferring resistance to blight. three main regions in the genome associated with variation in phenotype were found, one each on linkage groups b, f and g. the same population was genotyped using snps from the updated high resolution genetic map, and the qtl analysis was recalculated with the new markers  <cit> . the locations of the three qtl regions were refined to lg-b from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, lg-f from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and lg-g from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. the three qtls are referred to as cbr <dig>  cbr <dig> and cbr <dig>  respectively.

emphasis was placed on thoroughly and accurately defining the qtl regions of the genetic map within the physical map framework to enable targeted sequencing. sequence data from this region could help american chestnut restoration efforts in several ways, including development of markers for marker assisted selection, using additional markers for fine mapping of the qtls and identification of genes directly involved in blight resistance. to identify the physical map contigs within these three qtl regions, the ests containing the snps and ssrs that were genetically mapped in qtl regions were used for bac library overgo probe design. for each selected physical map contig, a mtp of bacs was selected for pooling and sequencing. the pools of bacs from each of the three qtl regions were sequenced, yielding a total of  <dig>  billion bases  . pools c and d were analyzed together because they originate from contiguous genomic sequence spanning cbr <dig>  the cbr <dig> sequence data assembled into  <dig> scaffolds spanning  <dig>  mb. the pool b sequences, representing cbr <dig>  assembled into  <dig> scaffolds totaling  <dig>  mb. data from pool a from cbr <dig> was assembled into  <dig>  mb in  <dig> scaffolds .table  <dig> assembly of sequences spanning the three blight resistance qtl regions in the chinese chestnut genome



the ends of bacs from the qtl minimum tiling paths were forward and reverse end sequenced using sanger technology. these sequences were compared to the next generation sequence data. the majority of the bac ends were found in the sequence assemblies:  <dig> % for cbr <dig>   <dig> % for cbr <dig> and  <dig> % for cbr <dig>  this affirmed that end sequence was produced from the majority of the bacs in each pool, and that the coverage across the minimum tiling paths were high.

the assembled genomic sequence scaffolds from the bac pools were annotated for repeat elements and genes. over  <dig> % of the sequence was identified as interspersed repeats, comprising  <dig>  % retroelements and  <dig>  % dna transposons. ltr elements, common in many plant genomes, encompassed  <dig>  % of the bases with slightly more gypsy elements  identified than copia elements . over  <dig>  microsatellite sequences were identified in the scaffolds, yielding an average of one microsatellite every  <dig>  bases.

across all three sequenced regions,  <dig> genes were annotated . functional annotation of the genes showed a diversity of molecular functions and biological processes . fifteen of the genes were annotated with the “defense response” go term . these genes are of particular interest for further study of blight resistance.table  <dig> genes in the qtl sequences annotated in silico with the gene ontology term “defense response”



qtl sequences and symap analysis
the sequence data obtained for the qtl provides an opportunity to assess microsynteny from the chestnut genome to reference plant genomes on a base pair level, and to ask how microsynteny results compare with the macrosynteny results from the physical map alignment analysis. peach provided the best reference genome in this analysis, with the highest percent of chestnut bases aligned in total and the highest percent of chestnut bases aligned uniquely. this suggests fewer rearrangements between chestnut and peach than between chestnut and the other genomes studied. the known genome duplication events since last divergence between chestnut and poplar as well as between chestnut and soybean are evident by the percent of chestnut bess aligning to multiple locations in those genomes.

by visualizing the locations of the syntenic alignments from chestnut to peach, larger areas of contiguous homology emerged where the chestnut scaffolds map within close proximity on a peach scaffold. fig.  <dig> displays the regions of the peach genome with putative homology to the qtl regions, via either sequence homology  or a symap prediction . the predicted syntenic regions from the symap analysis were supported by the sequence alignment in all cases except one  where symap identified a small region on peach chromosome  <dig> that the sequence mapping did not.fig.  <dig> alignments of the chestnut qtl regions to the peach genome. the chestnut qtls are aligned to the peach genome in distinct clusters. alignments found by the synmap software using the sequence data are small blocks to the right of the chromosome. alignments found by the symap software using the integrated physical and genetic map are the colored blocks to the left of the chromosome. a. symap prediction of synteny from physical map contig  <dig>  to peach scaffold_ <dig> from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. this prediction is not supported by sequence evidence. b. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny for ctg <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. c. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny for ctg <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. d. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from . <dig> mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny for ctg <dig> from . <dig> mb to  <dig>  mb. e. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny in four sections: ctg <dig> , ctg <dig> , ctg <dig> . f. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny in five sections: ctg <dig> , ctg <dig> , ctg <dig> , ctg <dig> . g. region of synteny identified by sequence similarity from cbr <dig> from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  symap predicted synteny for ctg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb



alignments of chestnut cbr <dig> clustered in two main regions of the peach genome - scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. the homology to peach scaffold  <dig>  was previously identified in the recent genetic linkage map paper  <cit> . the two previously reported regions of alignment to peach scaffold  <dig>  now appear to be part of one single syntenic block on peach scaffold  <dig>  chestnut sequence scaffolds containing  <dig>  mb were mapped, representing  <dig> % of the cbr <dig> bases. of the annotated cbr <dig> genes,  <dig>  % match genes most closely in these two peach genome regions.

the symap results from the  <dig> physical map contigs covering cbr <dig> also map primarily to scaffold  <dig> and  <dig> in peach. however, for scaffold  <dig>  symap predicted alignments from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, significantly larger than the sequence alignments . the symap-identified region from scaffold  <dig>   <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb is nearly identical to that predicted by the sequence alignments . in one instance symap predicted a putative syntenic region between cbr <dig> and peach scaffold  <dig> where there is no sequence alignment confirmation . the symap alignment, from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb on peach scaffold_ <dig>  is based on sequence alignments to two overgo probes: ccall_contig366_v <dig>  and ccall_contig3045_v <dig> . neither est sequence from these two probes has sequence similarity to the raw or assembled sequences from the bac pools. it appears that this region was missed in sequencing. an examination of the topology of the physical map contig shows that these two probes matched a set of bacs aligned with many hundreds of other bacs. this type of bac assembly is generally due to repetitive elements and results in a contig where hundreds or thousands of bacs are incorrectly “collapsed” into a small consensus region . thus, by selecting only a minimal tiling path across the contig, the resulting sequencing was likely not representative of the entire genomic sequence in that region. it is likely that the unique genomic regions containing the missing markers is flanking or between the repetitive elements that caused the incorrect assembly, and by being buried in the deep stack of incorrectly assembled bacs, they were not represented in the sequencing pool.fig.  <dig> topology of physical map ctg <dig> and matches to peach scaffold  <dig>  the physical map assembly of the ctg <dig> is visualized as short, parallel blue lines representing individual bac clones. the peach chromosomal segment, scaffold  <dig> from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, is represented as blue bar on the right with genes as small dark blue boxes. the alignment of the physical map contig to peach is based on sequence matches of two overgo probes: ccall_contig366_v <dig>  and ccall_contig3045_v <dig> , represented as green lines from the bacs with positive overgo probe hits to the sequence location on the peach segment. additional supporting evidence is provided by aligned bac end sequences 



the previously identified syntenic region for cbr <dig> was against scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb in peach. this block was confirmed in the current analysis, but two other regions also emerged as putative homologous areas. the three main syntenic regions found on peach for cbr <dig> in this analysis are scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, and scaffold  <dig> from . <dig> to  <dig>  mb. the scaffold  <dig> syntenic region was not predicted by symap, but the other two were predicted with very similar borders: scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  and scaffold  <dig> from . <dig> to  <dig>  mb . symap did predict a region of synteny for cbr <dig> on peach scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb that was not entirely supported by sequence evidence . one sequence scaffold, cbr2_scaffold <dig>  aligned near position  <dig>  mb, but no other sequence agreed with the symap prediction. the scaffolds placed in the three major syntenic regions in peach represent  <dig>  % of the cbr <dig> assembly and  <dig>  % of the cbr <dig> genes had a best match in peach within those three regions.

cbr <dig> had the most clearly placed homologous region in peach. the sequence alignments and the symap alignment agreed that it aligns to peach scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . of all the bases in cbr <dig>   <dig>  % were in scaffolds aligning to this region and  <dig>  % of cbr <dig> genes aligned best to that region of peach.

overall, symap was effective at identifying most of the regions predicted by sequence alignments. it predicted syntenies in  <dig> of  <dig> regions, although of significantly increased size in one instance. it also predicted  <dig> region of synteny missed from the partial sequence coverage of the qtl regions. had the comparative symap results not been available for analyses, the absence of this gene information in the qtl sequences may not have been identified. syntenic analysis provides both an avenue for transferring information across genomes and for validating new information.

two main qtls in peach have been identified for resistance to powdery mildew , located on scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and scaffold  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  <cit> . as discussed in  <cit> , two of the chestnut qtls overlap these two qtls from peach. the cbr <dig> qtl from chestnut aligns to a significant portion of the same region of scaffold  <dig> . cbr <dig> aligns to the end of the peach powdery mildew qtl on chromosome  <dig> 

discussion
chinese chestnut has emerged as a model species for the family fagaceae. naturally resistant to the chestnut blight , it has become particularly important for restoration of american chestnut . a backcross breeding strategy utilizing chinese chestnut as the source of natural resistance has been ongoing since the 1960s. development of molecular tools to reduce time and space requirements for breeding are vital to quickly advancing american chestnut restoration efforts and for advancing our genetic understanding of resistance to other chestnut pathogens such as phytophthora cinnamomi. here we report on new chinese chestnut genomic data sets including an improved integrated genetic/physical map and genomic sequence across qtl regions. these resources allow the chestnut genome to be compared on both a micro- and macro-synteny scale to other genomic model plant species.

the integrated physical and genetic map enabled a targeted sequencing approach for the qtl regions conferring resistance to chestnut blight. utilizing overgo hybridization probes corresponding to genetic map markers, six physical map contigs from the qtl regions were selected. from these a minimum tiling path of bacs was pooled and sequenced. the resulting assembled genomic sequence scaffolds provide a list of candidate genes to pursue for further understanding of the molecular underpinnings of blight resistance. these candidate genes have been tentatively prioritized through functional profiling and assignment of gene ontology terms. downstream analysis to explore the role of these genes is ongoing. comparative genomic approaches as well as sequencing of the corresponding homologous sequences in american chestnut may help to further elucidate the source of resistance to blight in chinese chestnut.

identifying and sequencing bacs across a region of interest is a cost-effective strategy for obtaining information on the genes and genomic organization in these important regions without undertaking an expensive and complex whole genome sequencing effort. american chestnut is plagued by biotic challenges beyond chestnut blight. the oomycete phytophthora cinnamomi causes root rot with a highly mortality rate and is widespread through the native range of american chestnut, presenting a significant barrier to any american chestnut reintroduction  <cit> . chinese chestnut can serve as a source of resistance to this pathogen as well as to chestnut blight  <cit> . if qtl regions of resistance are found using a genetic mapping approach, the same bac pooling and sequencing approaches could be used once again. the sequenced regions for blight resistance as well as any future desirable qtl have an additional utility beyond candidate gene discovery; they will enable discovery of markers for fine mapping and marker assisted selection. these markers will be essential for large scale backcross breeding efforts to produce a tree of primarily american chestnut origin but with a combination of chinese chestnut chromosomal segments that confer necessary biotic resistance loci.

the genomic resources for chinese chestnut also facilitate a survey of macrosynteny retained between chestnut and other species with sequenced genomes. analysis of peach, strawberry, soybean, medicago, poplar, papaya, arabidopsis, eucalyptus, grape and tomato found putative syntenic blocks in all species. peach, the phylogenetically-closest hardwood tree from this list, showed the highest amount of conservation with chestnut. the percent of duplicated blocks between the two genomes indicates that no whole genome duplication events  have taken place since the divergence of chestnut and peach from their last common ancestor. poplar and soybean have both undergone recent whole genome duplications, and these events can be detected by the significantly larger amount of chestnut genomic sequence that can be aligned to two separate locations. in poplar, the wgd occurred  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> , and over half of the chestnut syntenic blocks can be detected in two locations. for soybean, wgds have occurred twice, at  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> . the majority of chestnut blocks were detected in two locations, but interestingly, they were not found in three or four locations as might be expected from the occurrence of two wgds. this is likely due to the ongoing diploidization of the soybean genome, where the majority of homologous genes  were found to exist in blocks involving only two locations while a much smaller percentage were found in blocks in three or four locations   <cit> . the maintenance of multiple regions of synteny with chestnut is not detectable in the other genomes that have undergone a wgd. very few chestnut regions are aligned to multiple locations in the eucalyptus genome, which has evidence of a wgd  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , or to the tomato genome, which underwent a whole genome triplication around 71mya  <cit> . the lack of evidence of these events may be due to the large phylogenetic distance between chestnut and these species or the rate at which these genomes have undergone diploidization.

while the detection of wgds does appear to depend on phylogenetic distance, the overall number and length of conserved genomic blocks between species did not always correspond to the phylogenetic distance. for eight species, greater than  <dig> % of the genomic sequence anchored to pseudo-chromosomes and genomic sequence comprised of less than  <dig> % n’s . the quality of genomic alignments is likely to be comparable across these eight. the medicago genome is slightly more fragmented with  <dig> % of the genomic sequence in eight pseudo-chromosomes and  <dig> % ns. the papaya sequence is highly fragmented, with  <dig> % ns and no pseudochromosomes. interestingly, the number of putative syntenic blocks between chestnut and papaya was higher than the blocks found against eucalyptus, another malvidae with a more contiguous genome reference sequence.

the two best conserved genomes with  <dig> % of chestnut mapping to the other genome in syntenic blocks were peach and grape. although the results with the relatively closely-related peach clearly represent the expected close genomic relationship with chestnut, grape showed greater extent of genome structure preservation than would fit our expectations based on phylogeny. no wgds have occurred in either chestnut or grape since their last common ancestor. the grape genome is known to be structurally conserved with very few rearrangements since the paleo-hexaploid ancester of all rosids  <cit> . the slow rate of structural rearrangements in grape that has maintained an ancestral state of organization is a possible reason for the extensive structural homology. however, papaya and strawberry also have not experienced wgds since divergence from grape and the same level of conservation is not present. this may indicate that chestnut has a slower rate of structural reorganization over time, or another possible hypothesis is that grape is misplaced phylogenetically. in this last regard, it is interesting to note that grape  was formerly botanically placed by cronquist near the family rhamnaceae in order rhamnales  <cit> , much closer to peach and chestnut than the other sequenced genomes in our study. molecular studies led to its placement as an outgroup to the rosid i and ii clades but this placement did not have strong support  <cit> . this former phylogenetic position would support our findings concerning the degree of genome preservation among the study species.

CONCLUSIONS
if in fact grape is not misplaced phylogenetically, then it is interesting to note a trend toward woody plant species maintaining a higher level of structural synteny with each other than with herbaceous species in the same family. in this regard, poplar is an additional example. poplar has maintained a greater degree of genome similarity to chestnut than strawberry, soybean and medicago, which are all closer to chestnut phylogenetically. this could possibly suggest that woody plant species evolution is somehow more constrained, or much slower, than the herbaceous species within the same family. however, for strawberry in particular, the lack of syntenic blocks could be due to the fact that the strawberry genome assembly is slightly more fragmented than the peach, with  <dig> % of the sequence comprised of unknown nucleotide gaps versus  <dig> % for peach. for the species at a further phylogenetic distance, chestnut has double the quantity of conserved genomic blocks with papaya and eucalyptus versus arabidopsis. however, the arabidopsis thaliana genome may not be representative of other herbaceous species, as it has undergone recent  large-scale rearrangements and dna loss  <cit> . additional whole genome references from other woody and herbaceous angiosperm species is needed to conduct future comparative work and draw conclusions regarding the relationship of genome preservation to plant growth and habit. a contiguous whole genome sequence from chestnut and other members of the fagaceae  would also help to resolve rosid structural synteny on a finer scale.
