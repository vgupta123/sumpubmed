BACKGROUND
plants are continuously exposed to a diverse array of microorganisms including beneficial mutualists, commensals, and pathogens. to defend against pathogens, plants have evolved an innate immune system to recognize and limit infection . activation of defense responses involves the initial recognition of pathogens by chemical cues  or pathogen associated molecular patterns  that include bacterial lipopolysaccharides, flagellin, fungal chitin and ergosterol
 <cit> . recognition of pamp by specific pattern recognition receptors  in the plasma membrane leads to activation of defense responses in both non-host and basal disease resistance
 <cit> . activation of prrs subsequently induces the calcium-dependent protein kinase  and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathways leading to rapid ion fluxes, followed by transcriptional activation of defense responsive genes and synthesis of antimicrobial compounds to restrict infection
 <cit> .

primarily, regulation of plant defense responses is mediated through the phytohormones salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene 
 <cit> . however, in recent years other phytohormones including abscisic acid , auxins, gibberellins , cytokines  and brassinosteriods  have been shown to mediate specific plant defense responses . as plants are exposed to an array of pathogens with diverse infection strategies, activation of appropriate, pathogen-specific defense responses is vital for plant growth and productivity
 <cit> .

plant pathogens are classified as biotrophs, necrotrophs or hemi-biotrophs based on their life style and infection strategy. biotrophic pathogens live as obligate parasites that derive nutrients from living host tissues, while necrotrophs feed on dead tissues. hemi-biotrophs behave as both biotroph and necrotroph depending on the stage of their life cycle
 <cit> . defense against biotrophs involves sa-dependent responses whereas necrotroph resistance is sa-independent relaying primarily on ja/et-dependent pathways
 <cit> . the sa signaling pathway is associated with transcriptional activation of pathogenesis related  genes and the establishment of systemic acquired resistance  to provide enhanced, long lasting resistance to secondary infections
 <cit> . by contrast, ja/et signaling pathways are associated with resistance against necrotrophic pathogens and rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance , and are not typically associated with pr gene expression
 <cit> . however, there are complex signaling and cross talk between the sa-dependent and sa-independent pathways
 <cit> .

genetic screening of mutant plant populations has proved very useful for the functional analysis of defense responses
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, genetic screening has revealed a large number of mutants that exhibit altered responses to sa, ja and/or et and are more susceptible to virulent pathogens
 <cit> . identification and characterization of enhanced disease susceptibility  mutants, including a series of phytoalexin deficient  mutants, have helped to elucidate a number of defense signaling pathways involved in both basal and induced defense responses
 <cit> .

purple acid phosphatases  belong to a family of binuclear metalloenzymes that exhibit diverse biological functions in plants, animals and bacterial species
 <cit> . while the predominant role of paps in plants is regulation of pi uptake, paps also contribute to other biological functions including peroxidation
 <cit> , ascorbate recycling
 <cit> , mediation of salt tolerance
 <cit>  and regulation of cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis
 <cit> . plant paps share significant sequence similarity with mammalian tartarate-resistant acid phosphatases , which are involved in bone resorption
 <cit> , iron transport
 <cit>  and also in the generation of reactive oxygen species for microbial killing
 <cit> . in humans, trap expression is restricted to activated macrophages where it aids in the generation of free radicals to enhance microbial killing
 <cit> . although numerous reports have emphasized the importance of paps in pi acquisition, it has been difficult to assign a general physiological role to paps due to their diversity
 <cit> . the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> pap encoding genes
 <cit> . changes in pap gene expression differs in response to pi concentration where pap <dig> and pap <dig> are transcriptionally induced while pap7-pap <dig> and pap <dig> remain unchanged in response to pi deprivation
 <cit> . kaffarnik and colleagues first reported the accumulation of pap <dig> and a decrease in the abundance of pap <dig> in the secretome of arabidopsis cell culture following p. syringae infection, suggesting a role for paps in the host defense response
 <cit> . recently, li et al.,  also provided the evidence that some soybean paps  are involved in symbiosis under pi starved conditions. paps carry predicted signal peptides and presumably are secreted, however the biological function of these proteins in the extracellular space is unknown
 <cit> .

here we provide evidence that the arabidopsis pap <dig> is involved in basal resistance against certain plant pathogens. pap <dig> mutant plants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent isolate of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  in addition, expression of defense related genes following pst dc <dig> infection were impaired in pap <dig> plants.

RESULTS
identification of mutants exhibiting altered defense responses
one thousand two hundred unique arabidopsis thaliana  t-dna insertion lines were spray inoculated with the virulent isolate of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  and monitored for altered responses to the pathogen. mutants exhibiting extensive chlorosis in comparison to wild-type plants, scored by visual examination, were designated as susceptible. mutants exhibiting reduced chlorosis compared to wild type  were designated resistant to pst dc <dig>  t-dna insertion lines were also tested for altered root colonization with the plant growth promoting rhizobacterial isolate pseudomonas putida wcs <dig>  selected t-dna lines were retested for response to pst dc <dig>  a total of 24 t-dna insertion lines exhibited either altered disease susceptibility, root colonization or both compared to wild-type plants . the mutant line salk_126152c , which exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pst dc <dig> with extensive chlorosis on leaf tissues, was selected for further analysis . salk_126152c carried a t-dna insertion in the gene coding for purple acid phosphatase <dig>  . the enhanced susceptibility phenotype of pap5- <dig> plants was confirmed by assessing bacterial growth in leaf tissues post inoculation. as shown in figure 
1b, pap5- <dig> plants had greater titers of bacteria at  <dig> and 72 hours post inoculation  compared to the wild-type plant. to ensure that the altered responses to the pathogen were caused by disruption of the pap <dig> gene and not by an unlinked mutation, a second knockout mutant line salk_081481c , carrying a t-dna insertion on pap <dig> , was tested. pap5- <dig> plants also exhibited the extensive chlorosis and higher titer of bacteria similar to that of in pap5- <dig> plants .

further characterization of pap5- <dig> mutant plants
genotyping via polymerase chain reaction  confirmed that pap5- <dig>  carries a t-dna insertion within the first intron . to determine the impact of t-dna insertion on transcript levels of pap <dig>  reverse transcription-quantitative pcr  was performed using gene specific primers . most paps are reported to be highly inducible under phosphate starvation . in our experiments, we did not observe an induction of pap <dig> in wild-type seedlings grown in the presence of phosphate  or under phosphate starved conditions for 5 days  . we also observed that the expression of pap <dig> under optimal growing conditions was very low and this was confirmed with pap <dig> expression profile in the comprehensive microarray site https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/ . interestingly, we observed a marked increase in the expression pap <dig> when wild type seedlings were grown under prolonged phosphate starvation . for prolonged pi starvation wild-type seedlings were germinated in media containing reduced pi  for seven days and then transferred to media with no pi . after 9 days the seedlings were harvested for gene expression analysis. rt-qpcr analysis revealed a ~ <dig> fold increase in transcript levels of pap <dig> in wild-type seedlings grown under prolonged phosphate starvation  compared to seedlings grown in the presence of phosphate  . the expression of pap <dig> was not induced in both pap5- <dig>  and pap5- <dig>  seedlings grown under prolonged phosphate starvation . we did not observe any major alteration in germination, growth and development of pap <dig> mutant plants compared to wild-type under optimal growth conditions .

mutation in pap <dig> alters expression of host defense responsive genes and ros production
to explore the enhanced susceptibility of pap5- <dig> plants and to determine the role of pap <dig> in host defense responses, plants were spray inoculated with virulent isolate of pst dc <dig>  and the transcript abundances of selected defense responsive genes, including the pathogenesis-related gene <dig> , were determined. infection of wild-type plants with the virulent isolate pst dc <dig> resulted in ~10-fold induction of the pr <dig> transcript 24 h.p.i, while an increase of only ~2-fold was observed in pap5- <dig> plants . the level of pr <dig> transcripts in pap5- <dig> plants following pst dc <dig> infection was variable at 48 h.p.i. however, the expression of pr <dig> was a still less induced in pap5- <dig> plants compared to wild-type . expression of isochorismate synthase <dig>  was induced in wild-type plants  while no increase in transcript levels was observed in pap5- <dig> plants. although, expression of plant defensin <dig>   was induced  in wild-type plants, expression of pdf <dig>  was suppressed in pap5- <dig> plants . the expression pattern of these pathogenesis related genes were also confirmed using actin as the internal control .

a marked increase in the expression of pap <dig> at 6 h.p.i was observed in wild-type plants . however, this difference did not prolong to  <dig> and 48 h.p.i. we did not observe induction of pap <dig> in mock infected or pst dc <dig> inoculated pap5- <dig> plants . the expression profile of pap <dig> was further verified from the comprehensive microarray site http://bar.utoronto.ca/ using arabidopsis efp browser 
 <cit> . although, pap <dig> was strongly induced only at 6 h.p.i, our results suggest that this level of pap <dig> is required for maintaining resistance against virulent pst dc <dig> 

to further explore the mechanism of enhanced susceptibility, we studied hydrogen peroxide  accumulation using 3-3’-diaminobenzidine  staining. as shown in figure 
5a, accumulation of h2o <dig> in response to pst dc <dig> was reduced in pap5- <dig> leaves at  <dig> and 48 h.p.i. in contrast, there was an accumulation of h2o <dig> in the wild-type plants. the h2o <dig> concentration was quantified in leaf tissues following pst dc <dig> infection. the wild-type plants accumulated a higher concentration of h2o <dig> in response to pst dc <dig> inoculation as compared to pap5- <dig> plants .

resistance to botrytis cinerea is affected in pap <dig> plants
having demonstrated the enhanced susceptibility of pap5- <dig> plants to the hemi-biotrophic pathogen pst dc <dig>  we next tested the level of resistance of pap5- <dig> plants to the necrotrophic pathogen botrytis cinerea. four week old plants were inoculated with spore suspension of b. cinerea and lesion size was measured three days later. as shown in figure 
6a, pap5- <dig> plants developed a significantly larger lesion  than the wild-type . the greater lesion size on pap5- <dig> plants in response to b. cinerea infection, suggests the role of pap <dig> are important in limiting fungal growth.

to identify the role of pap <dig> in the resistance against b. cinerea, we assessed the transcript abundance of pr <dig> and pdf <dig> . as shown in figure 
7a, b. cinerea strongly induced the expression of pr <dig> in both wild-type and pap <dig>  in contrast, the level of the pdf <dig>  transcript at 24 h.p.i was only half of that observed in wild-type plants . by 48 h.p.i., however, the transcript levels of pdf <dig>  were similar in both wild-type and pap5- <dig> plants. similarly, we did not observe any significant differences in pap <dig> transcripts with b. cinerea infection .

responses to exogenous application of bth, a salicylic acid analog and methyl jasmonate  is unaffected in pap <dig> plants
since pap5- <dig> plants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pst dc <dig> and b. cinerea, we investigated the role of pap <dig> in responses to bth and mj. exogenous application of bth induced higher levels of pr <dig> in wild-type and pap5- <dig> . we also observed a slightly higher increase in the expression pr <dig> in pap5- <dig> plants 24 h after bth treatment. similarly, application of mj strongly induced the expression of pdf <dig>  in both wild-type and pap5- <dig> plants. we did not observe significant differences in expression of pdf <dig>  between wild-type and pap5- <dig> plants following application of mj . application of bth and ja induced expression of pr <dig> and pdf <dig> , respectively, indicative of an intact ja signaling pathway in pap <dig> plants. based on these experiments it was clear that pap5- <dig> plant was not defective in responding to exogenously applied bth or mj.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated the role of pap <dig>  a phosphate responsive gene, and its requirement in maintaining basal disease resistance against virulent pst dc <dig>  in previous studies pap <dig> transcripts were not detectable under phosphate starvation
 <cit> . unlike pap <dig> and pap <dig>  pap <dig> is not abundantly expressed under normal phosphate starvation conditions. our results revealed that pap <dig> is expressed only under prolonged pi starvation . mutation in pap <dig> has been shown to impair growth and increase anthocyanin accumulation in response to pi starvation
 <cit> . despite the loss of pap <dig> expression, mutant plants did not show discrete phenotypic differences from that of wild-type plants. both wild-type and pap5- <dig> plants exhibited an increased root/shoot ratio under pi starvation . this finding also indicates that pap <dig> does not play a major role in pi acquisition and is more likely to regulate other functions. the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> pap encoding genes
 <cit>  and this may lead to functional redundancy. this study suggests that the loss of pap <dig> resulted in impairment of defense responsive genes in response to pst dc <dig> infection. further, it appears that other pap genes does not compensate for the loss of pap <dig> function in response to pathogen attack.

genetic analyses of arabidopsis mutants have revealed many key regulatory genes in plant defense responses. enhanced disease susceptibility mutants including eds <dig>  pad <dig>  npr <dig> and sid <dig> have previously been reported to exhibit enhanced susceptibility and compromised defense responses to both virulent and avirulent isolates of pst dc3000
 <cit> . it is also evident that most bacterial pathogens including pst dc <dig> are inoculated by pressure-infiltration to study plant-bacterial interactions. although pressure-infiltration is the most commonly used inoculation method, these inoculation procedures may prevent early innate immune responses such as flagellin perception 
 <cit>  and stomatal closure
 <cit> . also fls <dig> mediated resistance was effective only when pst dc <dig> was sprayed on the leaf surface and not when bacteria was infiltrated in to leaves
 <cit> . hence, to mimic natural infection and to focus on the early defense responses we sprayed plants with suspension of pst dc <dig> containing  <dig> c.f.u ml–l. we also observed that plants sprayed with  <dig> and  <dig> cells/ml-l developed reduced symptoms compared to plants sprayed with  <dig> cells . similar bacterial titers have been previously used for plant-bacterial interaction studies
 <cit> .

we observed that the expression of pr <dig> was slightly induced in pap5- <dig> plants following pst dc <dig> infection, however the relative transcript level of pr <dig> was several fold lower compared to wild-type . the pr <dig> transcripts at 48 h.p.i were slightly lower compared to wild-type . similar variability has been observed in mpk <dig> silenced plants that were susceptible to pst dc3000
 <cit> . we observed that pap <dig> was strongly induced in the early stages of infection . this induction was transient as no difference was observed at  <dig> and 48 h.p.i. one possible explanation of this observation is that the level of pap <dig> induced during the early stages  of infection could be sufficient to dephosphorylate signaling proteins required for activation of defense responses downstream of pap <dig>  thus, it is also possible that pap <dig> might be involved in early responses to pathogens similar to glutotione s-transferse  and glucosyltransferase
 <cit> . moreover, members of the pap family have been known to exhibit peroxidase activity in addition to pi acquisition and recycling
 <cit> . although, the role of pap <dig> with regard to peroxidase activity has not been established, we hypothesize that the pap <dig> might mediate generation of reactive oxygen species  during pst dc <dig> infection. ros was initially proposed to be mediate plant defense response especially, during an incompatible interaction
 <cit> . virulent pathogens, capable of evading pathogen recognition are also known to induce ros production at latter stages of infection to lower levels
 <cit> .

we also identified the importance in pap <dig> in limiting the growth of the necrotrophic fungus, b. cinerea at the site of infection. the expression of pdf <dig>  was strongly suppressed in pap5- <dig> plants at 24 h.p.i resulting in an increase in lesion size. there were no differences in pdf <dig>  transcripts between pap <dig> and wild-type plants at 48 h.p.i. similarly, eds4- <dig> plants have been reported to exhibit enhanced susceptibility to b. cinerea despite comparable expression of pr <dig> and pdf <dig>  transcripts
 <cit> . these results also suggest that defense responsive genes other than pr <dig> and pdf <dig>  are required to mount wild-type levels of resistance against b. cinerea. sa synthesized in response to b. cinerea infection has reported to be derived via phenylalanine ammonia lyase  and not via isochorismate synthase 
 <cit> . since pap5- <dig> plants induced comparable levels of pr <dig> to wild-type plants following b. cinerea infection, it is possible that the effect of pap <dig> is restricted to sa derived via ics and not via pal.

application of bth and mj in wild-type and pap <dig> plants induced expression of pr <dig> and pdf <dig> , respectively . these results also suggest that pap <dig> is not required for expression of sa dependent pr <dig> expression. pr <dig> expression in pap5- <dig> plants appeared to be slightly higher than wild-type plants after of bth treatment . this slight increase in pr <dig> expression and its significance is unclear. similarly, application of sa on pad <dig> plants showed a slight increase in pr <dig> expression
 <cit> . application of mj induced the expression of pdf <dig> , indicating the regulatory function of pap <dig> to be upstream of sa and ja.

although, most plant paps are primarily associated with pi absorption and recycling, paps induced under pi starvation are also known to exhibit peroxidase activity similar to mammalian paps
 <cit> . all mammalian paps characterized exist as monomers of ~35 kda , while plants encode a relatively large family of high molecular weight  homodimeric and oligomeric paps . however, a recent study has identified mammalian-like low molecular weight pap  from roots of pi starved bean plants
 <cit> . moreover, the lmw, 35 kda plant paps are reported to be closely related to the 35 kda mammalian paps than to the large plant paps
 <cit> . thus, from our results we hypothesize that pap <dig> could play a role in both pi acquisition and in microbial killing during pathogenesis .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified the requirement of pap <dig> for maintaining basal defense responses against virulent pst dc <dig>  suggesting a role for pap <dig> in pathogen triggered immunity . we further demonstrated that pap <dig> acts upstream of sa to affect the expression of pr <dig>  and levels of pap <dig> do not affect bth and ja perception. further analysis on pap <dig> plants is likely to reveal novel components of signal transduction pathways that regulate defense responsive genes.
