BACKGROUND
the understanding of gene function in a poorly studied arthropod such as the cattle tick rhipicephalus  microplus  can benefit from the knowledge generated by genome-wide resources of the model insect drosophila melanogaster . the genome of the fruit fly d. melanogaster was among the first eukaryotic genomes to be sequenced and assembled  <cit> . d. melanogaster and r. microplus evolved from a common ancestor ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in comparison to the existing comprehensive genome resources for the fruit fly d. melanogaster, the cattle tick genome resources are limited to approximately  <dig>  est sequences  <cit> . in addition, the tick genome size of  <dig>  gbp  <cit>  compared to the d. melanogaster of  <dig> mbp  <cit>  will likely delay the generation of a complete r. microplus genome sequence  <cit> . a genome project for the related tick species, ixodes scapularis, with an estimated genome size of  <dig>  gbp, is currently underway  <cit> . although there are many invertebrate genomes completed including worms, nematodes, beetle, wasp, honey bee, flies, and mosquitoes , i. scapularis will be the first chelicerate:arachnida genome sequence available representing mites, ticks, scorpions and spiders.

among the many methods available for reverse genetic studies, rna interference  has gained popularity because of its demonstrated efficient post transcriptional gene-silencing effects in plants, fungi, nematodes, flies and cultured mammalians cells . rna mediated gene silencing is a widely conserved mechanism in eukaryotes and can be categorized into two partially overlapping pathways, the rnai pathway and the microrna  pathway. the rnai pathway is triggered by exogenous or endogenous dsrnas that are recognized by dicer rnase iii proteins which 'dice' these molecules into double-stranded small interfering rnas  of 21– <dig> nt in length  <cit> . a typical eukaryotic dicer consists of  <dig> helicase domains, a paz domain,  <dig> rnase domains and a dsrna-binding domain   <cit> , however some variations in this domain structure have been noted for insect dicers  <cit> . d. melanogaster has  <dig> dicer enzymes, dcr- <dig> and dcr- <dig> which are responsible for mirna and sirna production respectively  <cit> . by contrast most other animals contain a single dicer that generates both sirnas and mirnas.

the next phase in the rnai pathway involves the loading of sirnas into rna-induced silencing complexes . dsrna binding motif proteins , such as d. melanogaster r2d <dig> and caenorhabditiselegans rde- <dig> help sirnas to be loaded properly into silencing complexes  <cit> . using the sirnas as a guide, riscs find target mrnas and cleave them. argonaute  family proteins are the main components of silencing complexes, mediating target recognition and silencing  <cit> . most organisms have multiple members of the ago proteins, for example both insect species d. melanogaster and tribolium castaneum  have  <dig>  whereas c. elegans  has  <dig>  <cit> . in drosophila ago- <dig> and ago- <dig> are known to be associated with risc  <cit> . in c. elegans, the primary sirnas processed by dicer can also trigger the amplification of sirnas through a rna-dependent rna polymerase  to produce secondary dsrnas in a two-step mechanism involving secondary argonaute proteins  <cit> . this mechanism has not been demonstrated in other animals to date and is commonly found in plants rather than animals.

an additional phenomenon identified in plants and c. elegans is the systemic spread of rnai from cell to cell throughout the organism and its potential systemic transfer to subsequent generations through the germ-line  <cit> . proteins related to this phenomenon in c. elegans include sid- <dig>  which encodes a multi-transmembrane domain protein thought to act as a channel for dsrna uptake, and rnai spreading defective proteins  shown to be required for the systemic rnai response  <cit> . originally, systemic rnai was thought to be unique to c. elegans in animals, however preliminary evidence suggests that silkworm, honeybee, wasp and beetle utilize a sid-1-like  protein not found in mosquitoes or flies . furthermore, over  <dig> genes identified as necessary for dsrna uptake in drosophila cultured cells have also been identified in other insect species  <cit> . the specific mechanisms associated with dsrna uptake and systemic rnai in arthropods including some insect species are thus currently undefined.

of the above described proteins associated with rnai pathways, only one rnai tick protein has been identified to date, a putative r. microplus ago- <dig>  <cit> . rnai pathways in arthropods other than fruit flies and mosquitoes are beginning to demonstrate that there are evolutionary variations in these pathways with a higher level of divergence within the arthropoda than previously thought  <cit> . similarly, long dsrnas have been successfully applied in r. microplus  <cit>  and other tick species  for targeted gene knockdown to demonstrate the function of tick-specific genes in various tick life stages, with some studies producing evidence of systemic rnai spread into subsequent stages . with the advent of increasing arthropod genome resources, it may be feasible to identify more putative tick homologues of essential rnai pathway-associated proteins to better elucidate the tick rnai mechanism. improving the understanding of the mechanisms used by ticks for gene knockdown will assist to develop specific tick rna interference reagents and improved techniques for gene functional studies.

in this study we provide evidence for the presence of rnai pathway associated proteins in r. microplus ests and i. scapularis genome reads, including a tick homologue for dicer, argonaute proteins, rdrp and proteins associated with dsrna uptake and processing, and thus propose a putative tick rnai pathway. we then determined whether targeting genes in the cattle tick which are homologous to d. melanogaster genes with known rnai in vitro phenotypes  <cit>  would similarly result in abnormal phenotypes. we identified  <dig> candidate genes and conducted in vitro and in vivo  rnai loss-of-function assays. interestingly, only proteasomal genes impaired tick cell viability in vitro, whilst  <dig> candidates impaired tick egg and larval development in vivo.

RESULTS
evidence of putative rnai pathway in r. microplus
dicer
a dicer homologue was not confirmed in r. microplus however conserved domains commonly found in dicer proteins of higher eukaryotes were identified in the r. microplus bmigi <dig> est database . a single r. microplus est sequence  was identified as containing an orf of  <dig> amino acids  encoding a putative rnase iii  domain. the pairwise alignment of the orf with the amino acid sequence of c. elegans dcr- <dig>  showed 24% identity and an e-value of 8e- <dig> .

a dicer tick homologue with the expected domain structure for a eukaryotic dicer was identified in i. scapularis in a recently assembled supercontig  from the ixodes genome project   <cit> . this supercontig represents a  <dig> kb region of the i. scapularis tick genome and we identified a  <dig>  kb genomic region containing a single gene that has  <dig> exons . the predicted i. scapularis dicer protein is 1799aa long and has 31% similarity to the predicted dicer- <dig> isoform  <dig> from the dog canis lupus familiaris . furthermore, figure 1a shows that the predicted i. scapularis dcr- <dig> homologue has the same domain composition as its counterparts in d. melanogaster and c. elegans. the identified i. scapularis dicer homologue clusters with the dicer protein from the bovine bos taurus .

argonaute proteins
the analysis of r. microplus ests and i. scapularis genome reads identified putative tick homologues of d. melanogaster argonaute- <dig> and  <dig> proteins in both species .

*all proteins of the rnai pathway originate from d. melanogaster, except:cele = c. elegans; not found homologues include: c. elegans rsd- <dig>  rsd- <dig>  sid- <dig>  tag- <dig> , rde- <dig>  rde- <dig> ; t. casteneum tc-sil ; d. melanogaster eater, sr-ci, sr-cii, sr-ciii, sr-civ , cg <dig>  cg <dig> , r2d <dig>  vasa intronic gene, and spindle e .

systemic rnai and dsrna uptake/processing
available r. microplus ests and i. scapularis genomic contigs were screened for homologous genes to c. elegans proteins involved in rnai systemic spread  and dsrna uptake  . we identified putative hits to rsd- <dig> and epn- <dig> in both r. microplus and i. scapularis with 45% and 48%  and 71% and 43%  identities, respectively. screening for tick homologues against the  <dig> d. melanogaster proteins implicated in dsrna uptake and processing  <cit>  identified  <dig> and  <dig> homologues in r. microplus and i. scapularis, respectively, at varying levels of similarity for the  <dig> hits . the highest similarity was observed with dsrna uptake homologues associated with vesicle mediated transport, intracellular transport, oogenesis, endosome transport and atpase for both tick species .

risc components and rdrp
similarity searches with the protein sequences of the putative rna helicases armitage and rm <dig>  involved in the assembly of risc, resulted in best hits on r. microplus sequences tc <dig> and tc <dig> respectively but no homologues of spindle e were found . searches using d. melanogaster protein sequences for fmrp and tudorsn returned best hits on the r. microplus ests beae145tr  and beafw62tr , respectively. it must be noted that only one sn domain was identified in the putative homologue which either indicates that it is not a true tudorsn homologue or that the consensus sequence is currently incomplete. however, a recent genbank submission indicates the presence of a putative i. scapularis tudorsn identified simultaneously with this study . the ego- <dig> protein from c. elegans has rna-directed rna polymerase  activity and is associated with the c. elegans transitive rnai pathway by amplifying the trigger dsrna and/or sirnas  <cit> . the est beael55tr exhibited a 41% identity with the c. elegans rdrp – ego- <dig> . nine putative i. scapularis rdrp accessions have been deposited into genbank by the ixodes scapularis genome project consortium simultaneously with this study. a total of  <dig> of these i. scapularis rdrp sequences share conserved regions with the partial r. microplus rdrp and thus the new accessions eec <dig> , eec <dig> , eec <dig>  and eec <dig>  were utilized for the i. scapularis rdrp sequences in the consensus tree presented in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> tick rdrps demonstrate a close phylogenetic relationship with the partial r. microplus rdrp clustering with i. scapularis eec <dig> . i. scapularis sequences eec <dig>  and eec <dig> , and eec <dig> , form separate branches respectively. the rdrp proteins from c. elegans form another distinct cluster with the tick rdrps branching between c. elegans and those from fungi, plants and protists . apart from the armitage homologue, all r. microplus hits associated with risc components and rdrp above were confirmed in i. scapularis genome reads in this study .

summary of putative tick rnai pathway
selection of r. microplus conserved homologues for rnai gene silencing
to validate further a putative functional rnai pathway in r. microplus we conducted rnai-mediated loss-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo. we first selected tick rnai targets based on their homology to drosophila genes known to display an rnai phenotype  <cit> . of the  <dig> drosophila genes known to affect growth and viability,  <dig> were identified in the i. scapularis genome reads and  <dig> in the r. microplus bmigi <dig> database with  <dig> hits common between the tick species . these results were based on blastn searches with an e-value cut-off of <1e- <dig>  to select the most conserved sequences for tick in vitro studies, using high stringency searches ,  <dig> r. microplus ests were identified in the bmigi <dig> database as homologous to d. melanogaster genes with rnai phenotypes affecting growth and viability at z scores > <dig>  <cit>  . an additional  <dig> highly conserved homologues were selected as negative controls, one with a lower z score  and one with a nil z score thus with a nil effect on cell culture growth and viability , table  <dig>  the putative function of these  <dig> r. microplus ests were then assigned by retrieving the annotated interpro domains of their drosophila counterparts . evaluation of the assigned functional information revealed that  <dig> sequences putatively have a role in ribosome and protein synthesis ,  <dig> in proteasome and ubiquitinylation ,  <dig> in dna binding , and one in energy and metabolism . the controls used were the drosophila string of perls  and tat-binding protein- <dig>  homologues respectively.

¶ tbp- <dig> was included as culture control – no viability effects following dsrna knockdown in drosophila culture  <cit> ; sop  knockdown in vitro was not considered significant in the drosophila study. both targets were included in this study as putative negative controls

although all primers for target amplification prior to rna transcription were designed by targeting conserved consensus regions as described in the methods, amplification of tc <dig> , tc <dig>  and tc <dig>  was inconsistent with poor yields which were inadequate for rna transcription . dsrnas were transcribed successfully for the remaining  <dig> target genes  used for rnai experiments in cultured r. microplus bme <dig> cells and adult female ticks.

gene silencing in cultured tick cells
none of the dsrna treatments had significant effects on tick cell viability  compared to controls and compared to z scores > <dig> as described for the same targets in drosophila cells . however, tc <dig>  knockdown demonstrated the most severe effect on growth and viability  , also confirmed by microscopic examination of the cells . an additional  <dig> target genes  demonstrated a slight reduction on cell viability with z scores  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. it is feasible that the tc <dig> treatment may have had a stronger viability phenotype if the knockdown had been more effective . collectively the effects are less significant in tick cells than for their drosophila counterparts in drosophila cells, these  <dig> treatments are all associated with proteins involved in proteasome and ubiquitin function. quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed that all rnai targeted genes resulted in a substantial reduction of the corresponding target mrna  except for tc <dig> at 31% .

gene silencing in adult female ticks 
the same treatments were tested in live adult female ticks to measure any in vivo effects of gene silencing on tick survivability, egg output and larval hatching. eggs laid by ticks from the control groups showed no obvious morphological changes . the average egg mass weight was  <dig>  g for the control dsrna group,  <dig>  for the tick actin dsrna group,  <dig>  g for the pbs injection control group and  <dig>  g for the negative control group . eggs from the control groups showed a normal embryonic development time to larval hatching at  <dig> days. the larval hatching rates for control treatments ranged between  <dig> – <dig> % .

#lsd = least significant difference values

ubiquitin-63e dsrna treatment had the most significant effect on adult tick survival . eggs laid by r. microplus females injected with dsrna targeting genes associated with ribosome/protein synthesis  and proteasome/ubiquitin  demonstrated the most lethal effect on tick reproduction with deformed egg morphology and no larvae hatching . rnai targeting of tc <dig>  and tc <dig>  generated the greatest reductions in average egg output, with ubiquitin-63e  treated ticks again being significantly affected compared with the controls . figures 7b and 7c show examples of phenotypic effects on embryo development due to tc <dig>  and tc <dig>  knockdown respectively. down-regulation of the tc13930/tat-binding protein- <dig> also associated with proteasome/ubiquitin function, impaired embryo development leading to a poor larval hatching rate . in contrast, another gene associated with proteasome/ubiquitin  had no effect on egg development and hatching rates compared with controls, although this target demonstrated a decrease in cell viability in cell culture experiments above. the  <dig> ests associated with dna binding  both induced slower embryo development and reductions in egg hatching at  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. a single  tick was harvested to confirm the relative reduction of transcript levels  for both the adult ticks and eggs  for each drosophila homologue treatment. all treatments except tc <dig> demonstrated high knockdown of transcripts in adult tick viscera , with knockdown also confirmed in eggs tested . as the viscera from only one tick per treatment was harvested for rt-qpcr, it is feasible that the tc <dig> treatment on this single tick was not delivered successfully, however, none of the  <dig> ticks injected produced viable eggs indicating a knockdown phenotype for the tc <dig> treatment overall.

thus  <dig> of the  <dig> drosophila tick homologues demonstrated either a lethal effect on reproduction or a reduction in larval hatching rates when using dsrna targeted knockdown in vivo. the significant effects associated with the ubiquitin-63e homologue tc <dig> treatments correlates with the highest z scores for the same target in drosophila cell viability out of the sub-set of targets used here . data from the flybase website  identified that in vivo studies involving dsrna injection into drosophila embryos was lethal for both rpt <dig> and rps <dig> . however, rpt <dig>  was the only treatment which did not have an effect in vivo for ticks. fly in vivo knockdown studies associated with the  <dig> of the remaining targets were not found.

discussion
the lack of tick genome sequence resources has limited the ability to mine for rnai protein homologues however research to date has suggested that ticks utilize a dsrna-mediated rnai similar to that described in insects such as flies and mosquitoes  <cit> . de la fuente and colleagues  <cit>  postulated a model for tick dsrna-mediated rnai following the identification of a putative ago- <dig> protein in the r. microplus est database. our results support the diagram represented in de la fuente et al  <cit>  demonstrating evidence for putative tick dicer, risc associated proteins and dsrna uptake homologues, however we identified a r. microplus ego- <dig> homologue known to be implicated in rna-directed rna polymerase activity previously not identified in animals other than c. elegans. we also identified a cat-ago- <dig> at higher similarity than the tick homologue identified by de la fuente et al  <cit>  which exhibited higher similarity to the argonaute- <dig> protein of d. melanogaster in this study. this is the first comprehensive analysis of rnai sequence domains for a tick species and for the chelicerate arthropods.

compared to the vast insect genome resources , there is currently only one chelicerate genome available with the i. scapularis tick genome project nearing completion. to provide an evolutionary perspective to demonstrate relationships within the ecdysozoan infraphylum it is important to note that their common ancestors may have existed over  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . comparative genomics between these phyla is in its infancy and pathways such as rnai interference and gene regulation to date have been based on the fruit fly d. melanogaster as the model organism. as differences between rnai pathway mechanisms between c. elegans and d. melanogaster are evident, it is thus feasible that chelicerates could also vary from insects albeit their evolutionary distance is less   <cit> . indeed, definitive hits for the domains and proteins here were not exclusive to the arthropoda, with the putative tick rnai proteins matching homologues in diverse species such as insects , nematodes, and mammals .

while only a single dicer protein is present in mammals and in c. elegans, in d. melanogaster sirnas and mirnas are produced by distinct dicer enzymes  <cit> . in this study we identified one putative tick dicer in the i. scapularis genome reads however evidence for more than one dicer cannot at this stage be confirmed. this i. scapularis dicer was found to be most similar to a dicer- <dig> from a mammal. a r. microplus dicer could not be confirmed, however an i. scapularis homologue was also not previously identified using est data alone. our preliminary evidence points to a 'single' tick dicer with yet un-confirmed structure, though until complete tick genome resources are available the presence of more than one dicer cannot be entirely dismissed.

the risc structure contains the following essential proteins: d. melanogaster r2d <dig> or c. elegans rde- <dig>  <cit> , d. melanogaster homologue of the fragile × mental retardation protein  dfxr  <cit> , vasa intronic gene  and a tudor staphylococcal nuclease  <cit> . we were able to confirm the presence of putative tick fmrp but no significant hits for tudorsn or vig homologues and no significant similarity to known rna binding proteins using the current tick resources. however, a concurrent study has identified a putative i. scapularis tudorsn  yet to be confirmed in r. microplus. the argonaute  family of proteins contains  <dig> distinct rna-binding domains paz and piwi  required to bind the sirna and to slice the cognate rna to be degraded, respectively and thus are essential to risc  <cit> . our study confirmed the presence of tick ago- <dig> and ago- <dig> in the i. scapularis genome reads and found evidence for a complete ago- <dig> protein in the r. microplus est database. a r. microplus sequence containing a partial ago- <dig> protein was also identified. the functions of these tick argonaute proteins remains to be confirmed and further research is required to identify the full complement of tick ppd proteins.

flies and mosquitoes do not possess c. elegans sid- <dig> homologues known to be responsible for systemic and germ-line rnai. tick rnai observed in this study and the literature demonstrate that a systemic rnai silencing mechanism is active in ticks  <cit> . although a tick sid- <dig> was not found, we did however identify a tick homologue of the c. elegans ego- <dig>  an rna dependent rna polymerase  known to amplify trigger dsrna  and systemic rnai  <cit> . rdrp is otherwise absent in flies, mosquitoes and other animals. perhaps an rdrp-based rnai amplification mechanism within the ecdysozoans  is common, but lost in insect species? mechanisms for cell to cell dsrna uptake within ticks requires further investigation, as well as the confirmation of the activity of the tick rdrp and rsd- <dig> homologues identified here. further research to identify putative tick secondary argonautes associated with the transitive rnai pathway in c. elegans is also warranted. these mechanisms have not been studied in spiders, mites or ticks to date, thus confirmation of rnai mechanisms within the cheliceromorpha will assist to confirm potentially new evolutionary mechanisms previously not defined and which cannot be based on pathways observed in insect species.

an additional aim of our study was to investigate whether fruit fly rnai screens of conserved genes could be associated with similar tick phenotypes and tick gene function. we used a stringent search to enable the selection of the most similar sequences to maximize the probability of selecting a tick sequence which following dsrna mediated knockdown could also affect growth and viability in vitro. with the exception of proteasome/ubiquitin protein homologues, the rnai experiments with cultured r. microplus bme <dig> cells did not replicate the effects observed by boutros and co-workers in d. melanogaster cells  <cit>  for all targets. however, in vivo knockdown confirmed a lethal effect for  <dig> of the  <dig> targets, with only one demonstrating nil effects on tick reproduction. the ubiquitin-63e homologue which demonstrated the highest z score and impact on drosophila cell viability exhibited the strongest effects on viability in our tick study both in vitro and in vivo. however the effects on tick cell growth and viability from the remaining  <dig>  dsrna targets tested did not correlate well with drosophila demonstrating poor statistical significance at least under our in vitro conditions. kurtti et al  <cit>  found that cationic lipid-based reagents greatly improved the transfection of i. scapularis cultured tick cells as well as subsequent silencing of transgenes by dsrnai. perhaps uptake of nucleic acids by cultured tick cells is less efficient than with drosophila cells. in addition, although tick genome resources are currently incomplete, we did not identify tick homologues of scavenger receptors  known to be required for dsrna uptake in drosophila cell culture  <cit> . this suggests the recruitment of different receptors for dsrna uptake in tick cells compared to those described in drosophila.

it is also possible that the cell line types utilized in d. melanogaster and r. microplus are not directly comparable and functionally different. the  <dig> genes targeted by boutros and co-workers  <cit>  compared the effects using  <dig> embryonic cell lines, kc <dig> which is an 'early' embryonic cell line and s2r+ which is a 'late' embryonic cell line – potentially more comparable to bme <dig> cells which are 'late' embryonic in origin  <cit> . however, the bme <dig> average cell size is smaller at 15– <dig> μm compared to sr2+ cells at  <dig> μm  <cit> . the bme <dig> cell line also has a doubling time of  <dig> days, considerably slower than the drosophila cell lines. our in vivo studies were more convincing demonstrating lethal and inhibitory effects on tick reproduction for  <dig>  of the  <dig> targets. in vivo studies in c. elegans showed that 47% of the c. elegans orthologues of the  <dig> genes associated with the drosophila rnai phenotypes exhibited developmental phenotypes  <cit> . perhaps the fact that we chose highly conserved homologues increased the probability of success in our in vivo experiments compared with c. elegans. however, it is clear that tick in vitro rnai analysis using bme <dig> cannot be directly correlated to available drosophila in vitro data, unless perhaps only target genes with higher z scores  can be studied to increase the probability of a phenotype correlation.

the challenges encountered during the initial pcr amplification of tick template dna  prompted re-design of conserved primer sets for targets amplified and transcribed in this study. other tick dsrna studies have used cdna clones  <cit>  as templates for amplification and subsequent transcription verifying that perhaps the tick genomic dna templates are not amenable for high throughput gene amplification required for rnai functional screens. the tick genome is large  with a high ratio of repetitive and exonic sequences  <cit>  also confirmed here with the i. scapularis putative dicer genomic sequence structure with  <dig> exons. the presence of complex intronic/exonic structure can inhibit satisfactory pcr amplification of gdna possibly due to poor primer binding. this was mostly overcome in this study by improving primers by targeting conserved orfs across several arthropod species, however, amplification was not always consistent . it may be feasible to develop short interfering rna treatments which would be simpler to prepare than long dsrna treatments for difficult templates such as the tick, to date sirnas have not been applied in r. microplus loss-off-function assays. long dsrna gene silencing can also lead to off target effects and false positive rnai phenotypes  <cit> . until complete annotated tick genome resources are available, false positive knockdown resulting from long dsrna treatments and the specificity of  tick rnai reagents cannot be confirmed.

CONCLUSIONS
we utilized the existing r. microplus bmigi <dig> database  and the i. scapularis genome reads to identify  <dig> putative tick rnai proteins which confirmed the presence of a putative dicer, risc associated, dsrna uptake and rdrp proteins in ticks and constructed a putative tick rnai pathway. apart for proteasome/ubiquitinylation homologues, it was not feasible to replicate d. melanogaster embryonic cell culture rnai functional data in r. microplus bme <dig> embryonic cells. this could either be attributed to transfection/uptake issues and/or a difference in cell types in the fly and tick embryonic cell lines. we did demonstrate a correlating in vivo effect on embryogenesis for  <dig> of the  <dig> d. melanogaster tick homologues. the findings in this manuscript support the fact that perhaps the chelicerates may not be amenable to modeling based on insect pathways  as perhaps expected for arthropods. with the evidence of a tick rdrp and the propensity for systemic or germ-line rnai, it will be better to compare gene function and rnai pathways between members of the arachnida and the superphylum nemathelminthes . until more tick and related genomes  are available, such comparative studies within these subphyla are not feasible. clearly the rnai pathways warrant further elucidation, and tick specific genome and functional data will be beneficial for tick research and for the development of improved tick control measures.
