BACKGROUND
bovine congenital pseudomyotonia  is an impairment of muscle relaxation induced by exercise that prevents animals from performing rapid movements. so far it has been described in italian chianina beef cattle
 <cit> , in belgian blue cattle 
 <cit>  and, as a single case, in a dutch improved red and white cross-breed calf
 <cit> . the observed muscular stiffness in pmt is due to a delayed relaxation of muscles of the fast twitch  fibers. the biochemical mechanism underlying this dysfunction is a prolonged elevation in cytoplasmic free ca2+ concentration, resulting from a deficiency of the serca <dig> protein. serca <dig> is a skeletal muscle ca2+-atpase or ca2+ pump which is responsible for the ca2+ re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after muscle contraction
 <cit> . bovine pmt disease strongly resembles the inherited brody myopathy in humans
 <cit> , a condition of exercise-induced impairment of skeletal muscle relaxation, stiffness and cramps, caused by mutations of atp2a <dig> coding for serca1
 <cit> .

in chianina cattle, we have described pmt as autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by a missense mutation  in exon  <dig> of atp2a <dig> <cit> . this mutation leads to a p. arg164his substitution in a highly conserved region of the serca <dig> protein reducing its activity
 <cit> . in muscular dystonia type ii affected belgian blue cattle, charlier et al.
 <cit>  reported an atp2a <dig> missense mutation  leading to an amino acid substitution  in a highly conserved nucleotide binding domain. the same mutation was also reported to cause pmt in a single case of crossbred dutch improved red cattle
 <cit> .

we observed four cases of pmt in romagnola cattle, a white-coated italian beef breed. the purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype in comparison to the known pmt forms of other cattle breeds. since we observed similar clinical signs, histological and biochemical features as in the formerly described chianina cattle with pmt, we proceeded with a mutation analysis of atp2a <dig> and detected mutations, which most likely cause the disease in romagnola cattle.

RESULTS
clinical features
all four affected animals  showed congenital exercise induced muscle contraction that prevented them from performing muscular activities of greater intensity than a simple walk at a slow pace . when startled, or forced to move faster, the muscles ‘froze up’ temporarily, inducing rigidity and uncoordinated gait without signs of pain. if these stimulations were prolonged, the muscular stiffness became so pronounced that the animals fell to the ground. after a few seconds, the muscles relaxed and the animals regained their ability to get up and move. altogether the clinical picture strongly resembled the signs of pmt in chianina cattle
 <cit> . at rest electromyography  investigations of the triceps surae and gluteobiceps muscles and paraspinalis muscles of the thoracic region showed no spontaneous activity. apart from the muscular symptoms the affected animals didn’t show any other clinical signs: they were bright, alert and in good body condition. two of the animals  were  <dig> months old at the moment of the examination; the other two were  <dig> months old.

histopathology
histopathological examination of muscle biopsies from case  <dig> and case  <dig> revealed evidence of fiber degeneration followed by fiber regeneration, more severe in case  <dig> than in case  <dig>  in case  <dig> the cryostat sections showed enlarged fibers with pale cytoplasm  and pale degenerated fibers filled with mononuclear cells , many of them having an enlarged nucleus. immunostaining of the serial sections with anti-neonatal myosin heavy chain  antibody revealed the presence of medium sized  positive fibers transiently expressing anti-neonatal mhc and small size  positive fibers adjacent to necrotic myofibers, indicating active fiber regeneration . histochemical analysis did not revealed variability in fiber type distribution  or abnormalities in glycogen distribution . the observed polygonal honeycomb-like staining pattern indicates a normal association of glycogen to sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes
 <cit> .

biochemical analysis
similarities between clinical phenotypes presented here and pmt in chianina cattle prompted us to hypothesize that the delayed muscles relaxation observed in romagnola cattle might also be the consequence of prolonged elevation in cytoplasmic free ca2+ concentration. in order to validate whether a deficiency in sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase activity might also underlies the pseudomyotonia in romagnola cattle, we analyzed serca <dig> function in bovine skeletal muscles of affected and control cattle, respectively. the functional assay indicated that fast-twitch skeletal muscles of affected cattle showed a reduced activity, varying from 4% to 14% of controls . these data are in agreement with reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum serca <dig> activity in other pmt affected cattle
 <cit>  and in human brody's disease
 <cit> .

sarcoplasmic reticulum microsomal fractions probed with anti-serca <dig> monoclonal antibodies showed that the amount of serca <dig> protein was decreased in the pathological samples with respect to control samples . although the serca <dig> staining was variable in pmt affected muscles, the reduction in serca <dig> protein density consistently correlated with the decrease in ca2+-atpase activity. case  <dig> that showed the faintest serca <dig> band exhibited the most severe pathology, as demonstrated by active muscle damage and regeneration . sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions from pathological and control samples were also probed with specific antibodies against protein markers of junctional  and non-junctional  sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. as in pmt affected chianina cattle
 <cit> , sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions from pmt affected romagnola cattle did not differ in content of either junctional or non-junctional membrane markers, indicating that only serca <dig> is selectively affected.

genetics
the parents of all available cases were healthy. analysis of the available pedigree data revealed that two closely related artificial insemination sires  had three pmt affected offspring among their progeny . a non-viable full sib of case  <dig> was aborted and therefore the phenotype of this animal remained unclear. an additional single pmt affected animal  was observed after a father daughter inbreeding mating . pedigree records showed that the sire of case  <dig>  is distantly related to the fathers of the other pmt affected animals. under the assumption of recessive inheritance as described for pmt in other cattle breeds we searched for common ancestors of the four pmt cases. three pmt affected animals  could be traced back both on the maternal and the paternal path to a single common male ancestor  born in  <dig> . for case  <dig> we established only a paternal relationship to this possible founder sire. therefore, we concluded from the pedigree data that the causative mutation may have occurred in an unknown common ancestor. due to missing records in the database we were not able to collect further information.

atp2a <dig> mutation analysis
after we confirmed that the function of the serca <dig> pump is impaired in pmt affected romagnola cattle and that the disease is recessively inherited, we performed a mutation analysis of atp2a <dig>  mutation analysis in the four re-sequenced pmt affected animals revealed a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in comparison to atp2a <dig> of the cattle reference genome sequence . cases 2– <dig> were heterozygous for a missense snp in exon  <dig> . this variant causes recessively inherited pmt in chianina cattle
 <cit> . in addition, the same three pmt affected animals were heterozygous for two snps in atp2a <dig> exon  <dig>  . the pmt affected case  <dig> did not carry the exon  <dig> variant, but was homozygous for the two snps in exon  <dig> . taken together, the identified atp2a <dig> variants were associated with pmt under the assumption of a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance . all  <dig> obligate carriers  were either heterozygous g/a for the exon  <dig> variant or heterozygous g/t for both exon  <dig> variants . all four dams of pmt cases carry both exon  <dig> variants in a heterozygous state. on the paternal side, only the sire of case  <dig> is heterozygous for the exon  <dig> variants, the two other sires of pmt affected animals are not carrying the exon  <dig> variants, but they are heterozygous carriers of the exon  <dig> variant . the mutant exon  <dig> allele was found in a total of  <dig> additional romagnola cattle, which all were heterozygous for both snps. these presumed pmt carrier animals are closely related to the parents of the affected calves including the previously identified common male ancestor marte . the exon  <dig> and both exon  <dig> variants are rare in the breed as they were absent from additional  <dig> healthy romagnola controls. in addition, the mutant exon  <dig> allele was absent from  <dig> control cattle from  <dig> diverse breeds. apart from the  <dig> pmt cases no further compound heterozygotes were detected for the exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> snps in the romagnola control cohort. in conclusion, we observed an association between the occurrence of the disease and the presence of atp2a <dig> mutations. a single pmt case was homozygous for the exon  <dig> variants, the other  <dig> cases were compound heterozygotes with a paternally inherited exon  <dig> mutation and maternally inherited exon  <dig> mutations . as we always observed the two nucleotide substitutions in exon  <dig> together on the same haplotype, we speculate that these two substitutions arose simultaneously in a complex mutation event.

compound heterozygous mutations causing recessively inherited genetic diseases are well known in human genetics but not described commonly in purebred domestic animals. as recently shown for pmt in chianina cattle, the spreading of a single founder mutation after intense use of closely related artificial insemination carrier sires typically explains outbreaks of genetic disease in cattle populations
 <cit> . the origin of the mutation in the ancestors of both breeds seems not probable to the authors, so we assume that the most likely scenario for the presence of the exon  <dig> mutation in romagnola cattle is an accidental introgression of a chianina pmt carrier animal in the ancestry of neff .

possible impact of the serca <dig> mutations
genetic data showed that the pmt disorder is caused either by homozygosity or by compound heterozygosity of atp2a <dig> mutations. the previously reported exon  <dig> mutation leads to an amino acid exchange  within the actuator domain of the encoded serca <dig> protein
 <cit> . the two newly identified exon  <dig> substitutions are predicted to result in non-conservative exchanges of glycine to valine at two different sites ]) of the serca <dig> protein sequence . the p. gly211val mutation also affects the mobile actuator domain. the p. gly286val mutation is situated in the direct proximity of the fourth transmembrane domain . multiple protein sequence alignments show that the wild-type residues at the affected positions are conserved across all known serca <dig> orthologs in vertebrates including danio rerio and xenopus laevis .

we considered structure and function of serca <dig> to explain possible effects of the mutations causing pmt in romagnola cattle. the serca <dig> protein consists of three cytosolic domains  involved in the transmission of the major conformational changes
 <cit> . the intracellular calcium pump is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and transfers ca2+ from the cytosol of the cell to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum at the expense of atp hydrolysis during muscle relaxation. the mechanism of the transport has been explained in term of a cycle characterized by two conformational states: e <dig>  and e <dig> 
 <cit> . dramatic changes in orientation of the domains in the transition from e <dig> to e <dig> were described
 <cit> . in detail, the actuator domain is described as subjected to several rotations and to interact with phosphorylation and nucleotide binding domain
 <cit> . furthermore, there have to be movements of the helices in the transmembrane region to generate pathways for the entry or the release of the ca2+ ions
 <cit> .

in pmt affected romagnola cattle the side chain hydrogen atoms of glycines  <dig> and  <dig> are substituted by the much larger aliphatic hydrophobic side chain of valine, which tends to be buried in the center of protein, away from the aqueous environment. in both cases, the substitutions could have a role in disfavoring the proper folding of the protein. recently, the crystal structure of the bovine serca <dig> has been reported
 <cit> . the overall molecular model is very similar to that of the rabbit enzyme
 <cit> . the pmt causing mutations in serca <dig> described here occur in the actuator domain of serca <dig> and in the lumenal loop where the similarity between the bovine and rabbit crystal structure is very high.

the putative consequences of the mutations were also evaluated with the help of several software programs. in particular, they predicted the mutation as highly damaging, and causing loss of a turn and the extension of a beta-sheet as a consequence of the p. gly211val mutation, and possible loss of stability near a transmembrane domain. this could be probably detrimental to the protein functioning considering the great interaction of the actuator domain with other parts of the protein and the numerous movements the domain is subjected to . the significantly reduced serca <dig> activity implicates a partial loss of function of these mutations. however, the pmt affected romagnola animals showed no clinically obvious different disease signs compared to affected chianina cattle. the impact of the mutations reported in this paper are not directly comparable with the p. arg559cys reported in belgian blue
 <cit>  since it consists in the substitution of a residue interacting directly with a nucleotide. additionally, it is difficult to compare the effect of the mutations in cattle to the ones found in brody’s disease, since the reported human causative mutations
 <cit>  affect other parts of the serca <dig> protein and are neither observed in non-human species
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in pseudomyotonia affected animals the ca2+-atpase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes  was markedly decreased compared to control animals. we were able to successfully detect one known and one novel complex atp2a <dig> variant associated with the cases of pseudomyotonia. some cases showed compound heterozygous genotypes. this study is, to the author’s knowledge, the first time that compound heterozygosity for different mutations in a single gene has been reported to cause genetic disorder in livestock. furthermore, the knowledge of the new amino acid substitutions and their effect on the phenotype provides further insight into the function of the skeletal muscle serca <dig> calcium pump. finally, selection against these mutations can now be used to eliminate the mutant alleles from the romagnola breed.
