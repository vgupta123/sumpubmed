BACKGROUND
β-glucosidases  are glycosyl hydrolases that hydrolyze the β-o-glycosidic bond at the anomeric carbon of a glucose moiety at the nonreducing end of a carbohydrate or glycoside molecule. these enzymes are found essentially in all living organisms and have been implicated in a diversity of roles, such as biomass conversion in microorganisms  <cit>  and activation of defense compounds  <cit> , phytohormones  <cit> , lignin precursors  <cit> , aromatic volatiles  <cit> , and metabolic intermediates by releasing glucose blocking groups from the inactive glucosides in plants  <cit> . to achieve specificity for these various functions, β-glucosidases must bind to a wide variety of aglycones, in addition to the glucose of the substrate.

the β-glucosidases that have been characterized to date fall predominantly in glycosyl hydrolase families  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , with family  <dig> enzymes being more numerous in plants. glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  contains a wide range of β-glycosidases, including β-galactosidases, β-mannosidases, phospho-β-galactosidases, phospho-β-glucosidases, and thioglucosidases, in addition to β-glucosidases. the plant enzymes in this family generally fall in a closely related subfamily, but, despite their high sequence similarity, display a wide range of activities. besides β-glucosidases with diverse specificities, these plant enzymes include thio-β-glucosidases or myrosinases, β-mannosidases, disaccharidases, such as primeverosidase and furcatin hydrolase, and hydroxyisourate hydrolase, which hydrolyzes an internal bond in a purine ring, rather than a glycosidic linkage  <cit> . in addition, many enzymes in this group are capable of releasing multiple kinds of sugars from aglycones, such as isoflavonoid β-glucosidases, which can release the disaccharide acuminose and malonyl glucose, in addition to glucose itself, from isoflavonoids  <cit> . other β-glucosidases in this subfamily may have high specificity for glucosides or glucosides and fucosides, or may hydrolyze other glycosides, such as β-galactosides, β-mannosides, and β-xylosides, as well. primeverosidase has high specificity for primeverosides, with no hydrolysis of glucosides  <cit> , while furcatin hydrolase can hydrolyze glucosides as well as disaccharide glycosides  <cit> . clearly, plant family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolases show a range of sugar specificities.

plant family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolases tend to show high specificity for their aglycones, though many hydrolyze synthetic, nonphysiological substrates, like p-nitrophenol -β-glycosides  <cit> . the aglycones span a wide range of structures, including sugars  <cit> , hydroxaminic acids  <cit> , isoflavonoids  <cit> , rotenoids  <cit> , alkaloids  <cit>  hydroxyquinones  <cit> , cyanogenic nitriles  <cit> , etc. it is the specificity for these aglycones which is thought to specify the function of most of these enzymes  <cit> . since many β-glucosidases function in plants, it is important that these enzymes specifically hydrolyze their own substrates and not other substrates with which they may come into contact. it seems evident that the substrate specificity, localization of the enzymes with respect to potential substrates, and the activities of the substrates and hydrolysis products will determine the roles of these enzymes.

xu et al.  <cit>  described  <dig> gh <dig> genes in the arabidopsis genome, including  <dig> apparent thioglucosidases, and one enzyme that had high β-mannosidase activity, in agreement with the prediction from its similarity to tomato β-mannosidase. with the completion of high quality drafts of the rice genome, a thorough analysis of gh <dig> can be conducted in rice. to date, only a few rice β-glucosidase isozymes have been functionally characterized, with the activities described being hydrolysis of gibberellin glucosides, pyridoxine glucosides and oligosaccharides  <cit> .

to assess the functions of gh <dig> in rice, genes homologous to gh <dig> β-glucosidase genes have been identified from the rice genome, and their structures, predicted protein products and evidence of expression evaluated. in addition, we have cloned a β-glucosidase from germinating rice based on genomic data, and assessed its biochemical properties after expression in e. coli.

RESULTS
glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> β-glucosidase family
the completion of the oryza sativa l. spp. japonica rice genome project and the complementary indica rice  genome project by the beijing genomic institute  has allowed genome-wide analysis of gene families in this important crop  <cit> . the sequence and mapping information provided to the public databases by these projects enabled us to identify the genes for glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> members  in rice, determine their gene structures and genomic organization, and model their protein products and phylogenetic relationships. in this study, we used the dna sequences of japonica rice in the monsanto rice genome sequencing project, the torrey mesa research institute and genbank at ncbi and the indica rice sequences of the bgi as the starting point to examine the sequences homologous to gh <dig> members by manual annotation. by examination of the gene structures and prediction based on the knowledge of other plant gh <dig> genes, we rectified any errors in gene structures from the automatic annotation by the rice genome sequencing project contigs. thereafter, the gh <dig> members of indica rice were compared with those of japonica rice to identify which genes are orthologues . finally, all contig sequences were searched against the completed sequences of the  <dig> rice chromosomes in genbank to map each contig position on the chromosomes and identify the new gh <dig> members that were not present in the other databases. a new systematic code for the genes based on their chromosome location was devised with the chromosome number followed by a bglu number counting from the top of chromosome  <dig> through the bottom of chromosome  <dig> . to avoid confusion, previously published synonyms for all family members are provided in table  <dig>  the retrieved gene sequences were searched against the dbest and japonica rice full-length cdna databases to determine the mrna expression patterns of each gene in rice.

forty β-glucosidase genes, including  <dig> full-length genes,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> gene fragments, and  <dig> intronless genes, were identified, as listed in table  <dig>  thirty-six out of  <dig> genes are found in both japonica and indica rice with 98–100% sequence identity. the os11bglu <dig> gene was present only in japonica rice sequences, while os11bglu <dig>  osbglu <dig> and osbglu <dig> were only found in indica rice. the thirty-eight mapped gh <dig> genes are distributed over all chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig> . the osbglu <dig> and osbglu <dig> sequences have not been mapped to any chromosome, and it is possible they represent contamination of endophytic genes remaining in the indica genome draft. twenty-two out of  <dig> gene sequences are derived from the automated annotation in the public databases and  <dig> genes are derived from manual annotation. we corrected  <dig> of  <dig> automated annotation contigs that had misassigned one or more intron-exon boundaries. os11bglu <dig> and os11bglu <dig> appear to be pseudogenes, since they have premature stop codons and cannot produce full-length proteins.

the size of rice gh <dig> is not unexpected, since a search of the arabidopsis thaliana genome identified  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> homologues, including  <dig> probable pseudogenes and  <dig> intronless genes, which are distributed throughout all five chromosomes  <cit> . the slightly larger size of the family in arabidopsis may be due to the presence of myrosinases, which are not found in rice, and a larger number of pseudogenes. the large size of both rice and arabidopsis gh <dig> may reflect different substrate specificity and expression patterns in rice tissues and/or in response to environmental conditions among the gh <dig> members.

the presence of many gh <dig> genes in rice suggests they may hydrolyze an array of possible substrates, depending on their substrate specificity and localization with respect to the substrates. although a number of glycosides that could serve as potential substrates for rice gh  <dig> β-glucosidases have been purified from rice tissues, there have been few reports about the hydrolysis of these substrates by the enzymes. the major glycosides found in various tissues of rice include glycosylsterols, flavonoid glucosides, hormone glucosides, a vitamin glucoside, and pantonic acid glucoside. glycosylsterols found in rice are glycosyl-sitosterol, -campesterol and -stigmasterol in rice bran  <cit>  and β-sitosterol-3-o-β-d-glucoside in rice hulls  <cit> . the major flavonoid glucosides present in rice include 1) anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-o-β-d-glucoside and peonidin-o-β-d-glucoside, in black rice  <cit> ; 2) tricin-o-glucoside in rice hulls, bran, leaf and stem  <cit> ; and 3) hydroxycinnamate sucrose esters, such as 6'-o-feruloylsucrose and 6'-o-sinapoylsucrose in germinated brown rice  <cit> . hormone glucosides found in rice include gibberellin glucosides in ungerminated seeds and anther  <cit> , salicylic glucoside  <cit>  and indole-3-acetic acid -glucoside  <cit> . pyridoxine-β-d-glucoside was found in rice bran, callus and seedling  <cit> . another glycoside, namely r pantoyllactone-β-d-glucoside, was found in the shoots but not the roots of rice seedlings  <cit> .

many compounds  have been found in rice tissues in response to environmental stresses and in transgenic rice plants. recently, it was found that there is a high accumulation of iaa-glucoside in tryptophan-overproducing transgenic rice  <cit>  and of salicylic glucoside in rice overproducing nh <dig>  a key regulator of salicylic acid mediated systematic acquired resistance, in transgenic rice  <cit> . the level of pyridoxine glucoside was reported to be increased by the application of pyridoxine to rice callus and germinating seeds  <cit> . markham et al.  <cit>  reported that exposing uv-tolerant rice to high uv-b levels increased the levels of flavone glucosides. these results may indicate that the presence of high amounts of some metabolic compounds is corrected by converting them to the glucoside-conjugated forms. it still needs to be shown whether or not these compounds are later reactivated by β-glucosidases.

protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
the open reading frames  of thirty-seven gene-derived cdnas  showed a high level of shared deduced amino acid sequence identity to each other and other known plant β-glucosidase sequences. all deduced β-glucosidase protein sequences contain the putative catalytic acid/base and nucleophilic glutamate residues, except os4bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  in which the acid/base glutamate is replaced with glutamine, as seen in thioglucosidases. the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile consensus sequences are: w-x-t/i-f/l/i/v/s/m-n/a/l/i/d/g-e/q-p/i/q and v/i/l-x-e-n-g, respectively, with relative frequencies of amino acids at each position shown in figure  <dig>  these sequences are similar to the consensus sequences previously derived from known gh <dig> β-glucosidase sequences  <cit> . the presence of the appropriate active site glutamic acids in the consensus sequences motifs suggests that all the genes identified in the rice genome database, except os4bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  at least have the potential to produce catalytically active β-glucosidases. β-glucosidases with q instead of e at the acid/base position have been shown to be effective transferases in the presence of a good leaving group aglycone and a nucleophilic acceptor  <cit> , therefore even os4bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig> might be active if such glucosyl transfer reactions are catalyzed in vivo. additionally, as seen in multiple sequence alignment , the amino acids identified by czjzek et al.  <cit>  as critical for glucose binding  are generally well conserved in these predicted sequences. only the predicted os1bglu <dig> has q instead of h <dig> in maize, whereas maize w <dig> is replaced by f in os8bglu <dig>  os9bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  y in os1bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  l in os1bglu <dig>  os1bglu <dig>  os5bglu <dig>  os5bglu <dig> and os5bglu <dig>  m in os5bglu <dig>  i in os5bglu <dig> and s in osbglu <dig>  the residues that line the active site cleft and interact with the substrate aglycone of maize  <cit>  are indeed quite variable in the predicted rice β-glucosidases, as would be expected for β-glucosidases with different substrate specificities.

amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> members including  <dig> full-length genes and  <dig> pseudogenes, but not including the intronless bacteria-like enzyme genes osbglu <dig> and osbglu <dig>  and gene fragments, os4bglu <dig> and os4bglu <dig>  showed that the sequences share a common evolutionary origin . interestingly, many members that contain closely related sequences and cluster together are located on the same chromosome, such as the members in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  indicating localized  duplication events. some of the closely related gh <dig> members of arabidopsis also cluster on the same chromosome  <cit> . comparison between rice and arabidopsis gh <dig> members revealed that  <dig> clearly distinct clusters of plant-like gh <dig> genes  contain both arabidopsis and rice genes that are clearly more closely related to each other than to other gh <dig> genes within their own species. in addition, the arabidopsis sfr <dig> gene  forms another interspecies cluster with its rice homologue, os11bglu <dig>  which is marked  in figure  <dig>  thus, it appears the ancestor of rice and arabidopsis had at least  <dig> gh <dig> genes. however,  <dig> out of  <dig> arabidopsis genes group in two large clusters without rice gene members , which incorporate several of the subfamilies defined by xu et al.  <cit> , and appear to have diverged before the rice and arabidopsis. these include the myrosinases, which are not known to occur in rice, but also many apparent β-glucosidases. similarly, some rice genes appear to have diverged from their cluster of arabidopsis and rice genes before the other arabidopsis and rice genes diverged. these include the os3bglu <dig> and os3bglu <dig> genes, which diverged from the lineage containing the arabidopsis β-mannosidase genes before those genes diverged from os1bglu <dig> and os7bglu <dig>  this suggests that the closest homologue of os3bglu <dig> and os3bglu <dig>  which represent the most highly expressed gh <dig> genes in rice based on est analysis, was lost from arabidopsis. thus, genes found in the common ancestor, including two that were duplicated into most of the arabidopsis gh <dig> repertoire, appear to have been lost in the other plant's lineage. however, it is possible that rapid evolution of these genes caused them to be misplaced by the phylogenetic analysis, so care must be taken in interpreting these analyses. this analysis suggests that the common ancestor of monocots and dicots had at least 11– <dig> gh <dig> genes,  <dig> of which are represented by common lineages in modern rice and arabidopsis.

taken together, the great divergence of rice and arabidopsis genes after the divergence of the species and the loss of important lineages from either rice or arabidopsis suggest that much of the functional divergence of gh <dig> may have occurred after the monocot-dicot divergence. therefore, it may be difficult to extrapolate functions found in arabidopsis to those in rice and vice-versa, except in a few cases .

phylogenetic analysis of rice gh <dig> members with other plant enzymes also led to several interesting observations . some rice and arabidopsis members that are clustered in the same groups were found to be closely related to β-glucosidases from other plants. for example, os4bglu <dig>  os4bglu <dig> and os4bglu <dig>  which cluster with arabidopsis bglu <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are grouped with pinus contorta coniferin/syringin β-glucosidase   <cit> , suggesting that they may be involved in lignification. in fact, recombinantly expressed arabidopsis bglu <dig> and bglu <dig> have recently been shown to hydrolyze lignin precursors  <cit> . although arabidopsis bglu <dig> and rice enzymes  have sequences closely related to glycine max hydroxyisourate hydrolase   <cit>  and cluster into the same large group, they do not have heng catalytic nucleophile motif found in hydroxyisourate hydrolase, whereas the somewhat more distantly related os9bglu <dig>  os9bglu <dig>  and os9bglu <dig> do. however, the rice enzymes generally still contain the conserved glucose binding residues lost from the g. max hydroxyisourate hydrolase, so they may still act as glycosyl hydrolases, rather than as other kinds of hydrolases.

os1bglu <dig>  os3bglu <dig>  os3bglu <dig>  os7bglu <dig> and os12bglu <dig> β-glucosidases clearly grouped with barley bgq <dig> β-glucosidase/β-mannosidase  <cit> . kinetic analysis showed that the hydrolytic activity of os3bglu <dig>  toward β-linked glucose oligosaccharides is similar to that of the barley enzyme  <cit> . barley bgq <dig> also shares high sequence identity and similar gene organization with arabidopsis bglu <dig> and tomato β-mannosidase. recombinant atbglu <dig> protein shows a preference for β-mannoside and β-mannan oligosaccharides  <cit> , as does barley bgq <dig>  <cit> , while os3bglu <dig> prefers glucoside 10-fold over mannoside  <cit> . thus, within this cluster of closely related genes, both exo-β-glucanase and β-mannosidase  activities are found.

several gh <dig> enzymes associated with defense do not have clear orthologues in either rice or arabidopsis . no rice gh <dig> members cluster with the monocot chloroplast targeted enzymes, such as maize bglu <dig> and sorghum dhurrinase, while the  <dig> groups cluster loosely with the dicot defense enzymes, such as white clover and cassava linamarinases. the chromosome  <dig> cluster of os4bglu9- <dig> and os6bglu <dig> form one group embedded within the dicot defense enzymes, while os8bglu <dig>  os8bglu <dig>  os9bglu <dig>  os9bglu <dig>  os11bglu <dig>  and os11bglu <dig> form another cluster within this group. the association of these genes with the defense enzymes was seen in both distance-based and sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, but they were not strongly supported by bootstrap analysis in either case. as noted by henrissat and davies  <cit> , it is not generally possible to assign glycosyl hydrolase function based on sequence similarity scores alone, and the high divergence between the rice and defense-related β-glucosidases makes it unclear which, if any, play a role in defense.

there is only low sequence similarity between os11bglu <dig> and the other rice gh <dig> members, suggesting that it diverged from the other plant enzyme genes before plants evolved. os11bglu <dig> is most similar to the arabidopsis sfr <dig> β-glucosidase-like gene, ac: aj <dig>  <cit> . the sfr <dig> gene is also found in other plant species, such as maize, wheat, glycine max, lycopersicon esculentum, pinus taeda, sorghum, and barley.

gene organization
gene structural analysis of the β-glucosidases showed intron-exon boundaries and intron numbers are highly conserved among rice and other plant β-glucosidase genes. intron sizes in these genes, however, are highly variable. in most cases, very long introns contained retro-transposon-like sequences, while the orthologous short introns did not. five patterns of gene structures are distinguished by the number of exons and introns, which are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> exons, and intronless . however in each case, existent introns maintained the same splice sites. it was found that arabidopsis also has several gh <dig> gene organization patterns, though some are different from rice  <cit> . arabidopsis gh <dig> genes exhibit  <dig> distinct exon-intron organization patterns and  <dig> members exhibit a new intron that is not found in rice and is inserted into exon  <dig> to yield two novel exons. only gene structure patterns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of rice gh <dig> are found in arabidopsis. similar to arabidopsis, the most common gene pattern, found in  <dig> rice genes, is pattern  <dig>  in which there are  <dig> exons separated by  <dig> introns . the results from deduced amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis  showed that the sequences in intron-exon pattern groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are usually more closely related to each other within their groups than to the other groups.

the genes with  <dig> exons  are more divergent, indicating this pattern is probably the ancestral gene organization. those genes with  <dig> exons clustered together in one group with barley bgq <dig>  while those with  <dig> and  <dig> exons clustered in separate groups. this phylogeny is consistent with an ancestral plant β-glucosidase having  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, with losses of introns in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  to generate this phylogeny by gain of introns would require intron insertion at the exact same splice site position multiple times to generate the divergent genes with the  <dig> exon pattern. for a similar reason, though the sequence analysis shown in figure  <dig> suggests os9bglu <dig> diverged from os9bglu <dig> before it diverged from the ancestor gene of os11bglu <dig> and os11bglu <dig>  the loss of the same introns  in os9bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  suggests they are more recently diverged. since os11bglu <dig> also lacks intron  <dig>  it may have diverged more recently than os11bglu <dig> as well, though it is possible this was an independent intron loss. thus, it appears that rapid accumulation of changes in os9bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig> caused their sequences to differ more than would be expected from the recent divergence indicated by their shared gene structures.

the two intronless genes found in the bgi database may be contamination left from endophytes which has not been removed from the indica database, since originally there were  <dig> other intronless gh <dig> genes that were in this database. support for this hypothesis is provided by their sequences, since osbglu <dig> shows 58% identity with lactobacillis β-glucosidase, and osbglu <dig> has 70% identity with bacterial proteins, while they only share 28–30% identity with the other rice proteins. alternatively, they may have been gene transcripts that were captured by retrotransposons and reincorporated into the rice genome, or may have been obtained by lateral gene transfer from a bacteria. the intron-exon boundaries of the os11bglu <dig> gene do not correspond to those of other rice β-glucosidase genes, indicating it is from a separate lineage, though also of plant origin.

expression of rice β-glucosidase genes
in order to begin to analyze the tissue specific expression of the β-glucosidase genes in rice, a search for ests corresponding to each of the  <dig> different predicted genes was performed in dbest and the full-length cdna clones of japonica rice databases  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  an initial homology search with β-glucosidase sequences identified  <dig> ests and  <dig> "full" cdnas, which are derived from  <dig> gh <dig> genes. the os3bglu <dig> is most highly represented in the dbest database, with  <dig> ests. os3bglu <dig> has the second highest abundance of ests with  <dig> ests. other gh <dig> genes with a relatively large numbers of ests are os4bglu <dig>  os5bglu <dig>  os7bglu  <dig>  os9bglu <dig>  os9bglu <dig>  and os9bglu <dig> . however, the high abundance of ests for some rice genes might not reflect the relative expression levels in particular tissues, because of bias in selecting plant parts and developmental stages for production of est cdna libraries  <cit> . it should be noted that os4bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig>  which lack the catalytic acid/base, both have transcripts in the database, which indicates that they are transcriptionally active although the protein product may not have hydrolase activity. several genes are not represented in the est/full-length cdna databases . so, whether and where the full-length gene members are expressed remains unclear. it is possible that the expression levels of these genes are very low, or their expression may be induced by particular environmental conditions.

the source libraries for rice gh <dig> gene ests include callus, seedling , immature plant parts , mature plant , panicle at flowering and ripening stage, and immature seeds. some rice β-glucosidase genes have ests from stressed plant tissue libraries, such as salt , drought , cold , heat  and fungus infection  . in addition, some genes  are also expressed in transgenic rice, such as in the leaf of rice overexpressing aba-responsive element binding transcription factor  <dig> . these est/cdna sequences were used to identify the 3'utr sequence for each gene and it was found that all cdnas contain unique 3'utr sequences, which may therefore be used as unique probes for each gene. the occurrence of the ests/cdnas of β-glucosidase genes in tissues may correlate with growth and development. as mentioned by xu et al.  <cit> , the members of a given subfamily may have the same biochemical function and may be expressed in different cells, tissues, or organs and may be expressed in response to different environmental conditions and stresses. however, the multiple forms of rice β-glucosidases may also represent functional redundancy and be expressed in the same tissues.

one question of interest was why the chloroplast β-glucosidases seemed most predominant in maize, oat, sorghum and wheat, while such genes have lower expression in rice. a comparison of ests from several grain species showed that the chloroplast β-glucosidases of other cereals have the most est hits of gh <dig> genes, while in rice and barley, the rice bglu1/barley bgq60-like genes were more predominant . however, since the genome and transcriptome analysis of these grasses is not completed, some bias may have been introduced in the selection of the tissues studied. given the large number of ests in maize and rice, it seems likely to be a reasonable comparison, despite these limitations. if so, it may be that the defense function of the chloroplast isozymes in maize and other grasses, has been replaced by other defenses or by the abundance of os3bglu <dig>  which might be found in a separate compartment from defensive substrates, as well. though os3bglu <dig> is thought to function in hydrolysis of oligosaccharides released from the cell wall  <cit> , it might be possible for it to fulfill more than one role. recently, barley β-glucosidase, which is thought to help in hydrolysis of cell wall oligosaccharides during germination, has been found to hydrolyze cyanogenic glycosides from barley leaves  <cit> , giving support to the possibility of one enzyme playing roles in both the cell wall and defense.

a few reports described the expression patterns of β-glucosidases in rice plants. based on enzyme activity, gibberellic acid glucoside and pyridoxine glucoside β-glucosidases are found in rice bran  <cit> , and the cell wall-bound enzyme is found in seedlings  <cit> . northern blot analysis showed that os3bglu <dig> and os9bglu <dig> β-glucosidase genes are highly expressed in seedling shoots, but only os3bglu <dig> is expressed in flowers  <cit> . microarray analysis indicated that the transcripts of the ests be <dig> and bg <dig>  whose sequences are homologous to os3bglu <dig> and os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidases genes, respectively, are upregulated in response to high salinity stress in salt-tolerant rice , but not in the salt-sensitive cultivar ir <dig>  <cit> . subtractive hybridization cdna library screening indicated that the transcript level of the est contig bphiw <dig>  homologous to os4bglu <dig>  is upregulated in response to brown planthopper  <cit> . the presence of tricin-o-glucoside, a probing stimulant for planthopper  <cit> , suggests that the role of this enzyme is to release an active flavonol for defense. however, these studies did not show the specific roles of these enzymes in rice cells in response to such stresses. therefore, identification of natural substrates for the enzymes is needed to understand the functions of these enzymes.

properties of predicted proteins
the deduced precursor proteins were analyzed for potential signal sequences using signalp, and cellular location by psort. almost all β-glucosidase orfs, except os1bglu <dig> and osbglu <dig>  were predicted to have signal peptides ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, which would target them to the secretory pathway . three arabidopsis gh <dig> members, atbglu <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were predicted to not have signal peptides  <cit> . in arabidopsis, putative signal peptides were predicted to range in length from 19– <dig> aa. the predicted cellular locations for rice gh <dig> proteins included the cell exterior, cytoplasm, peroxisome, vacuole, er lumen, er membrane, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial matrix, which are similar to arabidopsis proteins. though assignment of cellular location was generally unclear using the psort program, os1bglu <dig> and os11bglu <dig>  are predicted to localize to the chloroplast, like maize, sorghum, wheat and oat β-glucosidases, though they are not closely related phylogenetically. however, none of the arabidopsis β-glucosidases seemed to be targeted to plastids, except possibly sfr <dig> . the deduced proteins were also analyzed for predicted molecular mass, pi, and potential n-linked glycosylation sites . predicted precursor protein lengths vary from 458– <dig> amino acids, which correspond to protein molecular weights of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kd. mature polypeptide lengths vary from 474– <dig> amino acids, corresponding to mw  <dig> – <dig>  kd. all but os1bglu <dig> contain one to six n-linked glycosylation sites. isoelectric points  of predicted proteins are divided into  <dig> groups, acidic , neutral , and basic , and  <dig> of  <dig> of these proteins are in the acidic group. predicted protein properties of rice gh <dig> members are similar to arabidopsis gh <dig> proteins, which have predicted mw of precursor proteins and mature proteins in the range of 56– <dig>  and 53– <dig> kd, respectively, and contain one to five n-glycosylation sites  <cit> . similar to os1bglu <dig>  atbglu <dig> and  <dig> do not contain n glycosylation sites. the number of likely isozymes complicates the interpretation of results from traditional biochemical approaches, such as measuring enzyme activities in tissue extracts. protein purification may also be difficult due to the similar sizes and pi of several predicted isozymes, as seen in table  <dig> 

although the occurrence of a number of glycosides in rice is known, few rice β-glucosidases have been studied and none of them has been tested for activity on most of the known natural glycosides. the first report of rice β-glucosidase activity against the synthetic substrate pnp-β-d-glucoside  was by palmiano and juliano  <cit> . partially purified β-glucosidases from rice have been described that hydrolyze gibberellin glucosides and pyridoxine glucosides  <cit> . analysis of thoroughly purified rice β-glucosidases has been described for a β-glucosidase from a cell wall-bound fraction  and os3bglu <dig> cloned from rice seedlings  <cit> . both enzymes showed high hydrolytic activity against cello- and laminari-oligosaccharides. in order to better characterize the function of the gh <dig> multi-enzyme family in rice, recombinant expression of these genes or their cdnas to produce the enzymes is necessary. the recombinant production and characterization of os4bglu <dig> is presented below as a first step in establishing the biochemical function of the rice gh <dig> enzymes.

os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidase cdnas cloning and sequence analysis
the protein product for os4bglu <dig> gene has highest sequence similarity to the previously described cell wall-bound β-glucosidase purified from rice seedlings  <cit> . therefore, it was chosen for expression to test if the protein would have the expected activity. the sequence of the os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidase mrna from rice was confirmed by rt-pcr cloning and sequencing, using rice cultivar kdml <dig> cdna as the template. a specific pcr product of  <dig> bp was produced, and its sequence overlapped that of the indica rice contig aaaa <dig> 

the reconstructed cdna sequence of os4bglu <dig> included a 1530-nucleotide long open reading frame encoding a  <dig> amino acid long precursor protein. the signal p program predicted the protein to contain a  <dig> amino acid signal sequence and a  <dig> amino acid mature protein . the deduced os4bglu <dig> n-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the previously purified cell-wall-bound rice β-glucosidase at  <dig> of  <dig> residues  <cit> .

the os4bglu <dig> cdna cds including the stop codon was inserted into pet32a/dest. the construct was used to transform origamib  e. coli. comparison of the protein profile of induced cultures with the os4bglu <dig> insert with those of empty plasmid controls by sds-page showed the thioredoxin-os4bglu <dig> fusion protein as an intense band at  <dig> kda on sds-page. the fusion protein was purified by imac, and a band corresponding to  <dig> kda was observed in sds-page . the enzyme was found to hydrolyze pnpg with optimal activity at ph  <dig>  and 37°c. the enzyme activity with pnpg at 70°c and 80°c drops about 17% and 39%, respectively, from the optimal activity at 37°c in a  <dig> min assay. it was stable at 4°c for several months.

os4bglu <dig> substrate specificity
the activity of the purified rice os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidase towards natural and artificial glycosides is summarized in table  <dig>  the os4bglu <dig> hydrolyzed the β- <dig> -linked glucose disaccharide laminaribiose, but not cellobiose  or gentiobiose . it showed high hydrolytic efficiency at different rates with β--linked oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization  of 3– <dig>  hydrolysis of β--linked oligosaccharides with dp >  <dig>  laminarin and barley  <dig> ,  <dig> -β-glucans by this enzyme could not be detected. the rate of hydrolysis of oligomeric substrates tended to remain approximately constant with increasing dp, which is a characteristic often observed with β-glucosidases  <cit> . on the tlc, os4bglu <dig> showed hydrolytic activity towards  <dig> mm laminaribiose and cello-oligosaccharides, but no measurable transglycosylation activity .

hydrolysis of pnp-glycosides with different glycone moieties was used to assess glycone specificity of os4bglu <dig>  it hydrolyzed pnpg and pnp-β-d-fucoside with 2– <dig> fold lower efficiency than oligosaccharides. it also hydrolyzed pnp-β-d-galactoside, pnp-β-d-xyloside, and pnp-α-l-arabinoside, at 45%, 45% and 26% the rate of pnpg, respectively. hydrolysis of pnp-β-d-mannoside, pnp-β-d-cellobioside, pnp-α-d-glucoside, and pnp-β-l-fucoside was not detectable. high hydrolysis of β-xyloside is similar to white clover β-glucosidase, but otherwise rare in gh <dig> enzymes that have been characterized to date  <cit> .

rice os4bglu <dig>  os3bglu <dig>  <cit> , and cell wall-bound β-glucosidases  <cit>  and barley β ii β-glucosidase  <cit>  are enzymes that hydrolyze β-linked glucose oligosaccharides, but not polysaccharides. however, the specificity for glycones and substrate chain lengths of these enzymes are different. in contrast to barley and rice cell wall-bound enzyme, os4bglu <dig> did not hydrolyze β--linked oligosaccharides longer than laminaribiose, but hydrolyzed various pnp-derivatives of monosaccharides. this substrate preference was not expected, since it was initially expected that os4bglu <dig> was the gene for the cell wall-bound β-glucosidase, and the sequence differences might be due to cultivar differences or sequencing errors. the substrate preference of os4bglu <dig> is somewhat similar to os3bglu <dig>  in that they both show slightly faster hydrolysis of pnp-β-d-fucoside than pnpg and hydrolyze laminaribiose and cello-oligosaccharides. however, there were many differences between these enzymes. for example, in contrast to rice os3bglu <dig>  os4bglu <dig> hydrolyzed β--linked oligosaccharides and laminaribiose at higher rates than pnpg, and did not hydrolyze cellobiose, gentiobiose, pnp-β-d-mannoside, and pnp-β-d-cellobioside. their sequence differences are likely to reflect the differences in substrate binding to the active site between these enzymes. the amino acids identified by czjzek et al.  <cit>  as critical for glucose binding  are conserved in rice os4bglu <dig>  os3bglu <dig>  and barley β-glucosidase. interestingly, the os3bglu <dig> protein sequence was closest to barley bgq <dig> at some of substrate binding residues that line the active site cleft and interact with the substrate aglycone of maize bglu <dig>   <cit> , suggesting os3bglu <dig> and bgq <dig> may have a similar substrate-specificity. however, these above mentioned amino acid residues were different from those in the os4bglu <dig> enzyme, which may account for the different substrate specificities for some oligosaccharides and glycones. for instance, os3bglu <dig> and barley bgq <dig> cluster with tomato and arabidopsis β-mannosidase and can hydrolyze β-mannoside, while os4bglu <dig> does not, and they also hydrolyze longer chain  <dig> -linked oligosaccharides  <cit> . all three enzymes prefer shorter  <dig> -linked oligosaccharides, with os4bglu <dig> being the most extreme, only hydrolyzing the dimer with this linkage. this likely reflects the bent shape of oligosaccharides with the  <dig> -linkage, which is somehow incompatible with the active site for longer chains. elucidation of the tertiary structures of these enzymes would help to clarify the enzyme-substrate binding mechanism leading to these preferences.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, forty genes encoding gh <dig> β-glucosidases have been identified from the rice genome databases. gene-derived cdnas were predicted and compared to experimentally derived cdna in the database. intron-exon boundaries and intron numbers are highly conserved among rice and other plant β-glucosidase genes. at least  <dig> rice β-glucosidase genes have corresponding ests, indicating their transcription, and these ests come from many tissues, indicating their temporal and spatial regulation and importance for the rice plant. most of these genes appear to have diverged from each other after the divergence of rice and arabidopsis from their common ancestor, implying that their functions may not be easily defined by studies in arabidopsis and other dicots. to begin a functional analysis of rice gh <dig> enzymes, the os4bglu <dig> cdna encoding the protein with the amino acid sequence that was most similar to the previously purified and characterized cell wall-bound β-glucosidase was cloned by rt-pcr and expressed in e. coli. recombinant os4bglu <dig> protein hydrolyzed β-linked oligosaccharides and pnp-glycosides. the specificity of os4bglu <dig> for oligosaccharides and pnp-glycosides was different from the previously characterized gh <dig> β-glucosidases/exoglucanases, cell wall-bound rice β-glucosidase, os3bglu <dig>  and barley β ii β-glucosidase. this work represents a start toward determining the roles of the gh <dig> β-glucosidases in rice, which provides an opportunity to investigate the molecular basis for differences in substrate specificity and the evolution of enzyme functions.
