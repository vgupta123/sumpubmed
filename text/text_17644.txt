BACKGROUND
lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin found in a wide variety of living organisms that decipher glycocodes in the structure of glycans attached to soluble and integral cell membrane glycoconjugates  <cit> . mechanisms for sugar recognition in microorganisms, plants, and animals are independently involved in several protein frameworks  <cit> . protein-carbohydrate interactions play biological roles in many cellular processes, such as cell communication, host defence, fertilization, development, parasitic infection and tumour metastasis. although, in many instances, their exact biological roles remain unknown, many lectins have been extensively studied as biochemical tools in biotechnology and biomedical research. marine algal lectins, however, have been described at a low pace, since the first report on their haemagglutinating activity  <dig> years ago  <cit> . marine organisms are recognized as rich sources of diverse and biologically-active molecules, many lectins from red and green marine algae have been isolated and characterised to date from more than  <dig> species. amongst activities of potential therapeutic and diagnostic interest are the inhibition of fungal growth  <cit> , induction and inhibition of human lymphocyte transformation  <cit> , identification of methacillin-resistant streptococcus aureus  <cit> , induction of mitogenic activity  <cit> , antibiotic activity against marine vibrios  <cit> , endothelium-dependent relaxation of the rat aorta  <cit> , inhibition of platelet aggregation  <cit> , and as an anti-hiv protein  <cit> .

in each family of lectins, the structure of their carbohydrate recognition domains  is essentially conserved. similar domains have been found in some phospholipase a <dig>  receptors named m and n-type and play an important role in the pharmacological activity of pla <dig>  <cit> . phospholipases a <dig>   from snake venom are very small proteins that catalyse the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at the sn- <dig> position in a ca+2-dependent reaction, releasing lysophospholipids and fatty acids  <cit> . snake pla2s have many pharmacological effects, such as: neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, haemolytic activity, haemorrhagic and oedematogenic activities  <cit> . pla2s that have lysine at the position  <dig>   <cit>  structurally keep the same motifs of pla2s that have aspartate at the position  <dig> , but their enzymatic activity is lost. despite this, these proteins display many biological activities, regardless of arachidonic acid release  <cit> .

in  <dig>  hori et al  <cit>  developed the haemagglutinating activity assay, combining algal lectins  and pla2s from the snakes, naja naja and crotalus adamanteus, and found an interaction between proteins, demonstrated by the inhibition of haemagglutination at a relatively low concentration  <cit> ; it was suggested that this effect probably was dependent on a protein-recognition site present in the lectin surface where the pla <dig> would bind. thus, some algae lectin-like proteins may play other important biological functions, such as providing an alternative source of a novel class of pla <dig> inhibitors. in this article, we investigate the effects induced by a new isolectin from the red marine alga, bryothamnion triquetrum, on some of the biological activities of pla <dig> and the interaction with catalytically-active pla <dig> from snake venom.

RESULTS
after the first purification step, on a preparative deae column, the main fraction, named bryothamnion triquetrum lectin , was obtained and then dialyzed and lyophilised. the chromatography of btl showed the presence of two main fractions, further named btl- <dig> and btl- <dig>  which is the most abundant isoform isolated . after reverse phase hplc, lectins were obtained with a high degree of purity . sds-page of btl- <dig> revealed the presence of one main protein band with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . the n-terminal sequences of both lectins were deduced and showed a high homology with btl  <cit>  and hypnins  <cit>  . in addition, btl- <dig> and btl- <dig> had a pi of around  <dig> . circular dichroism spectra of btl- <dig> were obtained in the wavelength region of  <dig> –  <dig> nm, revealing mostly random coil structures and a low content of α-helices or β-sheets .

pla <dig> was purified to high molecular homogeneity by reverse phase hplc , which resulted in only one electrophoretic band . the estimated pl value of this purified protein was  <dig>  . molecular exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  kda for the isolated btl-2;  <dig>  kda for the isolated pla <dig>  while the pla <dig> and btl- <dig>  when incubated for  <dig> minutes, had a single peak with a molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  –  <dig>  kda .

the pla <dig> was characterized as an enzymatically-active d <dig> pla <dig> with moderate enzymatic activity in comparison with pla <dig> from naja naja. in the presence of btl- <dig>  we observed a significant increase of 23% in the enzymatic activity of pla <dig>  when compared with the pla <dig> alone .

btl- <dig> demonstrated an inhibition of 98% in the growth of the gram-positive bacterial strain, clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis , but only a  <dig> % inhibition of the gram-negative bacterial strain, xanthomonas axonopodis pv passiflorae . pla <dig> decreased xap bacterial growth by  <dig> % and cmm growth by  <dig> %, whilst incubation of these two proteins pla2-btl- <dig> inhibited their growths by  <dig> % for xap and  <dig> % for cmm .

the pla <dig> isolated from crotalus durissus cascavella showed a strong platelet aggregation activity in washed platelets . the aggregation induced by pla <dig> was very effective , while btl- <dig>  at same concentration, did not produce any effect . when pla <dig> was incubated with btl- <dig>  we observed a significant decrease in the effect of pla <dig> on platelet aggregation in the concentrations of  <dig> μg and  <dig> μg, respectivaly,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, when compared to pla <dig> alone . the averaged platelet aggregation assay data is depicted in figure  <dig> 

btl- <dig>  injected in the paw of rats, did not induce an evident inflammation and its oedematogenic effect was similar to that of the saline control . pla <dig> from c. durissus cascavella venom induced a strong oedema response at  <dig> minutes following injection. the maximum inflammatory response was observed at  <dig> min following injection of pla <dig>  under the same experimental conditions, pla <dig> incubated with btl- <dig>  exhibited a lower oedematogenic effect, compared to non-incubated pla <dig> . in addition, btl- <dig> did not inhibit the oedema induced by compound 48/ <dig> , a potent oedematogenic agent that induces the release of inflammatory mediators .

pla <dig> from crotalus durissus cascavella shared a high degree of amino acid similarity with other rattlesnake venom pla2s, such as the pla2s isolated from crotalus durissus terrificus isoforms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , crotox b and mojave b . furthermore, the amino acid sequence of pla <dig> was highly conserved at the n-terminal region, calcium-binding region, active site, α-helical and β-wing. based on its three dimensional structure, crotalus durissus cascavella pla <dig> exhibited a high number of random coil structures, mainly in the calcium binding and the c-terminal loops . the 3d model also suggests the presence of an extensive loop that connects helix  <dig> to helix  <dig> and other significantly long random coil structures on the c-terminal region  in this pla <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the interaction between a marine alga lectin and a pla <dig> from a rattlesnake was first detected by hori et al  <dig>  <cit> . herein, we report the marine alga extract purification of btl- <dig>  one of the lectin isoforms isolated from the red marine alga bryothamnion triquetrum. lectins from b. triquetrum, with low molecular weight, share similar structural features with other low molecular weight lectins isolated from red algae, such as hypnea japonica  <cit> . these structural similarities found suggest the importance of this protein for the development of these organisms and define a low molecular weight class of lectin.

hori et al   <cit>  suggested that the interaction between marine alga lectin and pla <dig> was correlated to the presence of a specific interaction domain. experiments conducted by these authors showed that the haemagglutination activity of hypnins was strongly inhibited by the addition of pla <dig>  which strongly suggests that the interaction between hypnins and pla <dig> involves specific molecular recognition. accordingly  <cit> , hypnins have two distinct binding sites; a carbohydrate-recognition site  and a protein-recognition site . interestingly, the interaction between pla <dig> with hypnins did not affect the hemolytic activity induced by pla <dig> 

the n-terminal amino acid sequence of btl- <dig> has a high homology with the lectins of hypnea japonica, which probably possess the c-type cdr motif  <cit> , as such btl- <dig> probably possesses these same sites in its structure. the cd spectra analysis revealed that both btl- <dig> and btl- <dig> have a predominance of random coils, stabilized by disulfide bridges, conferring some interesting properties to these proteins such as resistance to high temperatures, very similar to hypnins which possess thermostability  <cit> .

the catalysis of enzymatically-active pla <dig> can be affected by factors such as substrate, and pla <dig> activity is strongly enhanced by aggregated substrates that include micelles or monolayers  <cit> . another important factor is substrate concentration, when the critical micelle concentration  is reached, this enhances the enzymatic activity by several orders of magnitude  <cit> . conformational changes in the structure of pla <dig> are also an important factors that increase enzymatic activity  <cit> ; these changes are located in the n-terminal residue and in the surface binding loop in which the calcium binding loop is located. the main conformation change, located in the n-terminal helix, has a small shift towards the calcium ion of pla <dig>  the role and structural relevance of the n-terminal region have also been reported  <cit> . in addition, the suppression or the chemical modification of the n-terminal region results in a strong reduction in the enzymatic activity of catalytically-active pla <dig> 

it has been reported that highly-purified heparin sodium salt is able to increase the enzymatic activity of catalytically-isolated pla <dig> from crotalus durissus terrificus venom  <cit> . the potentialization of the enzymatic activity of heparin has been observed in the treatment of some vascular disorders in clinical trials. on the other hand, the inhibitory effects of the neurotoxic or other pharmacological activities of pla <dig> are well known. the mechanism of action of pla <dig> towards heparin involves inducible conformation changes to the active site, the n-terminal region, and strong binding with the cationic site located in the c-terminal region  <cit> , which leads to the modifications in the biological effects induced by the catalytically-active pla <dig> 

our results showed that this novel basic hypnin-like lectin, isolated from bryothamnion triquetrum, seems to form a heterodimeric structure with pla <dig> from the crotalus durissus cascavella venom and that its molecular binding strongly increases the enzymatic activity of pla <dig>  furthermore, our data suggest that the complex that is established between pla <dig>  from crotalus durissus cascavella, and lectin, from bryothamnion triquetrum, probably involves a hydrophobic contact and indirectly affects the catalytic site of pla <dig>  thus, our results show that some pharmacological activities, induced by pla <dig> isolated from crotalus durissus cascavella, did not involve its solely enzymatic activity, indicating that the specific actions induced by this pla <dig> are due to the presence of pharmacological sites on the protein surface, which are distinct from catalytic sites, allowing pla <dig> to bind specifically to soluble proteins or membrane-bound proteins that participate in the mechanism of action and this is not an isolated case, as observed for other pla <dig> from other sources  <cit> . the antibacterial activity, however, is very dependent on the ability of this pla <dig> to destroy the bacterial membrane. these facts are supported by the results of the bacterial growth rate of xap, which was strongly inhibited by a complex formed by pla <dig> and btl- <dig> 

conversely, the platelet aggregation assay showed that the presence of the lectin significantly decreased the pla <dig> aggregation effect, showing that the pharmacological activity of the enzyme was affected by btl- <dig>  this same effect occurred in the oedema assay, where in the presence of the lectin, the pharmacological activity of the pla <dig> was decreased, inducing a lower oedema. the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid  by the pla <dig> generates free aa and lysophospholipids that are the precursors of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor, respectively  <cit> . at first, it was thought that secretory pla2s served to provide substrates for the biosynthesis of proinflammatory lipid mediators; however, it was found that not all pla <dig> hydrolyze aa from intact mammalian cells, suggesting that the generation of lipid mediators is not a general function of this enzyme  <cit> . a great breakthrough was the identification of other biological effects of pla <dig> in cells involved in inflammatory and immune responses. as such, these results support the idea of the presence of another pharmacological site in the pla <dig>  isolated from the crotalus durissus terrificus, which is distinct from the enzymatic site. something similar is observed in some other pla <dig> that interact with target cells via membrane peptidoglycans and with specific or promiscuous receptors  <cit>  and, in some cases, lead to activation of some intracellular cytoplasmic pla <dig> and several proteins including pka and pkc  <cit> . some specific mutation studies carried out with pla <dig> showed that the binding of secretory pla <dig> to the receptor involves a specific recognition of the crd region of this receptor  <cit> , which is located near the catalytic site of pla <dig>  our results, however, suggest that the pla <dig> region involved in the binding with btl- <dig> produces a structural change that results in the reduction of its pharmacological action, compared to untreated pla <dig>  the c48/ <dig> experiment supports this argument, since it shows that the lectin was not binding to the tissues to hinder the c48/ <dig> or pla <dig> activity, but that it was acting in the pla <dig> 

class i and ii secretory pla2s possess an antiparallel, poorly conserved β-wing. the structural conformation, though variable in relation to the rest of the enzyme, is internally consistent across species. the wing extends outwards into the solvent, and the 'wingtip' is poorly anchored. it has been suggested that biological properties such as neurotoxicity, myotoxicity or anticoagulation may be associated with the β-wing  <cit> . the presence of a similar β-wing motif in the 3d model of the pla <dig>  isolated from crotalus durissus cascavella venom, may explain its remaining pharmacological activity, which probably has two distinct pharmacological sites, one located in the random coil that links the n-terminal helix with the helix  <dig> and the β-wing.

the main conclusions of this study are that; 1) the pharmacological activity of pla <dig> from crotalus durissus cascavella is completely dissociated from its enzymatic activity and also some of its biological activity. 2) the pla <dig> model revealed that the presence of an extensive hydrophobic random coiled region may be involved in the interaction with blt- <dig>  forming a random-coil based structure.
