BACKGROUND
recent studies
 employed chromosome conformation capture with next-generation sequencing  to systematically identify genomic regions in physical, three-dimensional  proximity. the resulting contact data lists two genomic positions—each corresponding to a restriction enzyme site—and the frequency with which they were paired-end sequenced together. the smaller the 3d distance between two genomic positions, the larger their interaction frequency should be. given this relationship, 3d genome reconstructions have been generated from the contact data via constrained optimization for several organisms including saccharomyces cerevisiae
 <cit>  and the asexual stages of plasmodium falciparum
 <cit> , the causative agent of malaria. both of these are eukaryotic, haploid, and have relatively small genomes . the constraints used in the reconstruction optimization derive from external biological knowledge about genome organization
 <cit> .

both contact data and attendant 3d genome reconstructions are exciting developments because they provide relatively high resolution, genome-wide information on chromosome organization — which previously could only be probed with low-throughput, low-resolution techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization . there is now widespread interest in using this data to gain insight into the 3d nuclear localization of functional genomic annotations  sets). this interest is based on the hypothesis that genome function is linked to its organization
 <cit> . for example, co-regulated genes may be physically co-localized in the nucleus during transcription
 <cit> . similarly, 3d genome organization likely influences genome stability
 <cit>  and the location of dna breakpoints and gene fusions
 <cit> , including those that drive certain cancers
 <cit> .

ay et al
 <cit>  recently assessed the co-localization of functional annotations in p. falciparum 3d genome reconstructions; however, their approach led to results that were difficult to interpret. their assessment was performed as follows. for all data point pairs belonging to a given functional annotation, they dichotomized  distances as “close” or “far” based on prescribed thresholds . then, they assessed enrichment of “close” pairs in that functional annotation using methods developed for contact data
 <cit> . in the results of this analysis, some functional annotations were significant across all thresholds; however, many functional annotations were significant for only one  threshold but not the other. further, there was often no consistent relationship with respect to threshold. this makes interpretation difficult, especially since it is not obvious what constitutes a good choice for a biologically meaningful threshold. we refer to this approach as “dichotomized distance enrichment” throughout the paper.

similar analyses have been performed in s. cerevisiae
 <cit>  using contact data rather than the 3d genome reconstruction. here, pairs of data points belonging to a functional annotation were dichotomized as “close” if they were observed together  filtering); otherwise they were “far”. then, the enrichment of “close” pairs in the functional annotation was tested. we refer to this approach as “dichotomized contact enrichment” throughout the paper.

rather than dichotomizing the data, we propose directly assessing the significance of distances derived from the 3d reconstruction. this approach is potentially an improvement over previous analyses since it avoids dichotomization of distances  and does not require  thresholding or tuning. for a given functional annotation, we computed the median of pairwise euclidean distances  between data points belonging to that functional annotation and then assessed the significance of this test statistic by resampling. we also expanded to two-tailed analyses to enable tests for dispersion of functional annotations since, for example, localization near the nuclear periphery is functionally relevant
 <cit> . our approach provided novel findings, replicated key results from prior analyses and provided unambiguous inference for functional annotations that previously reported significance levels that varied by dichotomization threshold. we refer to our approach as “mped assessment” throughout the paper.

RESULTS
we performed mped assessment of functional annotation localization in 3d genome reconstructions  for p. falciparum ring stage
 <cit>  and s. cerevisiae
 <cit>  from two different restriction enzyme libraries, hindiii and ecori . we also tested dichotomized contact enrichment  and compared the results. results for dichotomized distance enrichment have been reported in detail previously .figure  <dig>

3d localization of p. falciparumfunctional genomic annotations
for p. falciparum ring stage, we assessed the localization of the following functional annotations: centromeres, telomeres, virulence  genes, rdnas, and  <dig> clusters of genes with developmentally regulated expression
 <cit> . we used normalized

p. falciparum ring stage contact data and the  3d genome reconstruction inferred from these data
 <cit> .

centromeres, telomeres, and vrsm genes were significantly co-localized under mped assessment . these functional annotations were also significantly co-localized under dichotomized contact enrichment  and under dichotomized distance enrichment at all three thresholds examined . furthermore, experimental fish data supports the nuclear clustering of telomeres in p. falciparum

eight out of  <dig> clusters of genes with developmentally regulated expression  were significantly co-localized under mped assessment, but only  <dig> was significantly co-localized under dichotomized contact enrichment . of the  <dig> expression clusters significantly co-localized under mped assessment, only  <dig> were significant across all three thresholds under dichotomized distance enrichment ; the other  <dig> had threshold-dependent significance under dichotomized distance enrichment. in the discussion, we comment on why assessing localization at the 3d reconstruction level  may reveal significant co-localization for some functional groups that was not detected using contact level data.

3d localization of s. cerevisiaefunctional genomic annotations
for s. cerevisiae, we assessed the localization of  <dig> go terms and  <dig> other functional annotations, including centromeres, telomeres, retrotransposon long terminal repeats , classes of non-coding rnas, classes of replication origins, classes of dna breakpoints, and classes of cell cycle -regulated genes . we report functional annotations that were significant under mped assessment with both restriction enzyme libraries  or significant with both libraries under dichotomized contact enrichment.

there is no indication that the s. cerevisiae hi-c data was normalized in previous studies
 <cit>  prior to generating the 3d genome reconstructions or assessing functional annotation localization: the original study
 <cit>  preceded the formalization of hi-c data normalization pipelines
 <cit>  that redress biases due to factors such as fragment length, gc content and mappability. accordingly, we normalized the s. cerevisiae hi-c contact data  and then generated new reconstructions, as in
 <cit> , from the normalized contact data  before assessing functional annotation localization.

centromeres and ltrs were significantly co-localized under mped assessment and under dichotomized contact enrichment . previous analyses of this s. cerevisiae hi-c data also found significant co-localization of centromeres
 <cit>  and ltrs
 <cit> . furthermore, experimental fish data support the nuclear clustering of centromeres
 <cit>  and ltrs
 <cit>  in s. cerevisiae. several go terms that map to ltrs  were also significantly co-localized under both analyses but are not included in table 
 <dig> because of the redundancy in the mapping.table  <dig>

telomeres were significantly co-localized under dichotomized contact enrichment, but not under mped assessment . experimental fish data support nuclear clustering of s. cerevisiae telomeres
 <cit> . in the discussion, we comment on why assessing localization at the 3d reconstruction level  may not detect significant co-localization for some functional groups that were detected at the contact data level .

the previous study that analyzed s. cerevisiae functional annotation localization under dichotomized contact enrichment reported significant co-localization of certain functional groups , and trnas)
 <cit>  that were not replicated in our analysis under dichotomized contact enrichment. this difference may be due to our testing a much larger number of functional groups  and/or our normalization of the data prior to assessment. experimental fish data supports trna clustering in s. cerevisiae
 <cit> . under dichotomized contact enrichment, our q-values for trnas were  <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig>  . under mped assessment, our q-values for trnas were  <dig>   and  <dig> e- <dig> .

generating a null referent distribution
in our mped assessment of functional annotation localization above, we generated a null referent distribution by resampling points from the same chromosome as observed .

an alternative approach is to resample preserving the distance that a data point is from the center of the nucleus , but not preserving the chromosome structure. such a resampling scheme may detect functional groups that are co-localized given the rabl configuration of the s. cerevisiae 3d genome reconstructions
 <cit> . to perform such a resampling scheme, we divided the radius of the nucleus into fifths and created a series of concentric spheres at each partition. points were then resampled from the 3d annulus  between concentric spheres. the results under mped assessment with annulus resampling were similar to those with chromosome resampling for both organisms .

affinity propagation clustering applied to 3d telomere coordinates
experimental fish data indicate that telomeres form  <dig> to  <dig> clusters in p. falciparum
 <cit>  and  <dig> to  <dig> clusters in s. cerevisiae
 <cit> . to determine if we could recapitulate this property of telomere organization from the 3d genome reconstructions  we applied affinity propagation  clustering
 <cit>  to telomere coordinates in the 3d genome reconstructions. unlike many other clustering algorithms  where the number of clusters needs to be specified from the outset, ap clustering optimizes the number of clusters within the algorithm. applying ap clustering yielded  <dig> telomere clusters for both p. falciparum  and s. cerevisiae , consistent with the fish data. this also revealed which telomeres are close to each other in the 3d genome reconstructions .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we propose using mped to assess functional annotation localization and applied this approach to p. falciparum and s. cerevisiae 3d genome reconstructions. we argue that, if functional annotation localization assessment is to be performed at the 3d genome reconstruction level, then mped assessment offers advantages over dichotomized distance enrichment
 <cit>  because it avoids dichotomization of the data  and does not require  thresholding or tuning thereby providing unambiguous results.

however, as with any statistic and associated inferential assessment, mped embodies specific choices and assumptions. for the statistic, we have employed the median  of all pairwise distances . evaluation of alternative formulations  had comparable results . for inferential assessment, we have used two approaches to generating null referent distributions ; other potentially organism-specific possibilities could be entertained. a strength of methods imposing dichotomization is that obtaining reasonable referent distributions is relatively straightforward.

there are other putative advantages of assessing functional annotation localization at the 3d reconstruction level:  while the contact data is inherently pairwise, the 3d reconstructions exploit higher order relationships;  the 3d location of sites for which there is missing contact data is readily determined from neighbouring points in the reconstruction because of chromatin contiguity; and  biological and biophysical constraints about genome organization are imposed . thus, emergent properties of the 3d reconstructions may reveal significant co-localization of some functional annotations that were not co-localized in the  contact data .

the advantage of assessing functional annotation localization at the contact data level is that resampling to generate a null distribution makes recourse only to chromosome labels, while at the 3d reconstruction level, resampling makes recourse to the  chromatin structure. the 3d reconstructions for s. cerevisiae have low chromatin density near the nuclear periphery and large chromatin voids in the nucleus . given that s. cerevisiae telomeres are in the periphery, resampling making recourse to the chromatin structure thus samples points from more internally than the telomeres de facto , which may make it difficult to detect co-localization. resampling points without making recourse to the chromatin structure  would not be stringent enough. s. cerevisiae telomeres may be co-localized given a spherical 3d nucleus ; however, mped assessment does not detect significant co-localization of s. cerevisiae telomeres by generating a null distribution by resampling points making recourse to the  chromatin structure.

it is important to note that there are caveats to the use of hi-c data . most current hi-c data represents averages over many cells. the first example of single cell hi-c in mouse has recently been reported
 <cit> ; however, a 3d mammalian genome reconstruction has not yet been generated for computational reasons. mammalian hi-c analysis is complicated further by diploid genomes, though methods related to hi-c have been developed for deconvolving sequence data for homologous chromosomes
 <cit> . finally, hi-c is a snapshot of highly dynamic chromatin organization; these dynamics are important to understand, but difficult to capture. for the 3d reconstruction-based approach to be meaningful requires that the reconstruction provides an adequate representation of dynamics and between-cell variation. methods for making such assessments and devising and contrasting reconstruction algorithms are active research areas
.

in the current study, we assessed the 3d localization of genomic annotations . each data point has an x,y,z coordinate; co-localization is assessed by estimating the significance of distances between points. in future research, we will expand to assessing the 3d localization of continuous, functional genomic data – for example, by overlying chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  peak height on top of the 3d reconstructions. while our current research provides a framework for such an analysis, future research will require developing and/or applying methodology suited to detect co-localization of data that has an x,y,z coordinate paired with a continuous outcome .

CONCLUSIONS
when assessing functional annotation localization at the 3d reconstruction level: mped assessment, as proposed and applied here, offers advantages over the existing approach . mped assessment replicated key findings from previous analyses, as well as providing novel results, and provided unambiguous significance estimates for functional annotations that previously had significance levels that varied by threshold.
