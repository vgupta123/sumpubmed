BACKGROUND
kaposi’s sarcoma  is an endothelial tumor and a major cause of aids patient death. its associated herpes virus  is a double strand dna virus and a member of the γ subfamily of human herpes viruses  <cit> . kshv can also infect lymphocytes, promoting transformation into primary effusion lymphoma  or multicentric castleman’s disease  in immunodeficient patients  <cit> . the distinct pathological outcome of kshv in two types of human tissues serves as a model system for studying cell type specific gene regulation.

in ks tumors and pels, the majority of cells are latently infected and express viral genes only within a specific region of the viral genome: the kshv latency-associated region  . this region encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen , v-cyclin , v-flip , the kaposin gene family , and  <dig> micrornas . mirnas are small rnas of 19– <dig> nucleotides that inhibit translation  <cit>  and induce degradation of mrnas . the genomic location of kshv mirnas and their abundant expression in kshv-associated tumors suggests they play an important role in establishing latency and promoting kshv pathogenesis.

the first step in deciphering the functional role of a mirna, is to identify its target genes. the 5′ sequence  of a mirna, guides its complementary binding to the 3′utrs of its target mrnas and facilitates the repression of the latter in the rna-induced silencing complex  . therefore, analysis of mirna sequence properties can computationally predict its targets  <cit> . due to the short length of the seed sequence and the general disregard for tissue specific target-gene expression, bioinformatic approaches typically report large numbers of genes as putative targets of individual mirnas reviewed by . greater than half of all protein coding genes in mammalian cells are estimated to contain multiple mirna target sites  <cit> . restricted by tissue specific gene expression, only a small fraction of putative targets are present in a specific cellular context   <cit> . the direct targets frequently do not function in isolation but interact with other molecules to form gene regulatory networks . accordingly, genes that are positioned at a lower level of the network hierarchy may also be functional targets even without the mirna target site in their sequences  .figure  <dig> 
micrornas can affect grns directly and indirectly. the regulatory effects of a mirna are not limited to the direct risc-dependent targeting. both direct and indirect targets are integral components of grns and should be included in functional analysis. when a mirna is over-expressed, its direct targets should be down-regulated. if the direct target is a repressor of downstream genes, then as a result of mirna regulation, these genes will be de-repressed and their levels will go up . on the other hand, genes downstream of activators and transcription factors will go down accordingly with the direct targets. in addition, proteins that physically associate with direct targets to function together in a complex may also be affected.



this global regulatory effect can be captured by gene expression profiling after perturbing specific mirna levels. the differentially expressed genes  reflect the global outcome of the mirna regulation  <cit> . a priori knowledge of molecular interactions is necessary to place the degs in the context for interpreting the joint effect of direct and indirect targets from a network perspective. a systems approach, which integrates secondary data with primary measurements of gene expression, can connect different layers of regulators from sparse and noisy expression profiles  <cit> . this approach is enabled by a variety of databases on dna-protein and protein-protein interactions .

kshv mir-k12- <dig> provides a unique model for studying tissue specific grns with regard to viral infection and pathogenesis. its seed sequence is identical to cellular mir- <dig>  previous studies have identified similar functional targets of the two mirnas  <cit> . mir- <dig> is a well-studied “oncomir”, being associated with immune activation  and implicated in tumorigenesis . mir-k12- <dig> and mir- <dig> show mutually exclusive expression in kshv infected tissues: mir-k12- <dig> is abundantly expressed in pel cells, while mir- <dig> was detected in kshv infected endothelial cells  <cit> .

in this study, mir-k12- <dig> was expressed in kshv negative human endothelial and b cells, close to physiological levels observed during kshv infection. tissue specific, as well as common target genes and pathways, were identified and the results were integrated with transcription networks, protein-protein interactome and signaling pathways. this systems approach  revealed that mir-k12- <dig> opposes host defenses and contributes to the proliferation and survival of kshv infected cells by influencing key elements in cellular grns like tfs and signaling proteins. our approach is applicable to a broader range of regulators of interest for understanding the grns in which they operate.figure  <dig> 
analysis pipeline. by comparing the microarray profiles of mirna-expressing cells and mock transduced cells, genes with significant changes were identified. the down-regulated genes with predicted mirna binding sites were categorized as putative direct targets of mir-k12-11/mir- <dig>  for direct targets that are known transcription factors, transcription factor binding sites  were searched in the promoter regions of other affected genes. for those indirect targets, motif analysis within their sequences identified potential regulators. in addition, gene ontology and known protein-protein interactions help to build the gene regulatory networks .



RESULTS
targetomes of mir-k12- <dig> in endothelial and b cells had little overlap in direct target genes, but shared many indirect targets in common pathways
to mimic the cellular context of mir-k12- <dig>  we moderately expressed mir-k12- <dig> in cells of lymphatic origin  and endothelial origin , using a recombinant retroviral vector with bi-cistronic mirna and gfp genes. the constant detection of gfp in the transduced cells indicated stable expression of the mirna gene . quantitative pcr results further confirmed the ectopic expression of mir-k12- <dig> in both bjab and tive cells . specifically, the retroviral transduction approach imitates mirna expression under physiological conditions, unlike transfection experiments that excessively over-express the mirna and trigger off-target effects . in our experiment, the copy numbers of ectopic mir-k12- <dig> were lower than in bcbl- <dig> cells , indicating that it was not expressed at superphysiological levels . to compare the grns of mir-k12- <dig> to those of mir- <dig>  we also carried out retroviral transduction for mir- <dig>  in bjab cells, mir- <dig> was significantly expressed over the endogenous level. the mir- <dig> transduced tive cells, however, did not show significantly increased mir- <dig> levels over endogenous expression, preventing further analysis on mir- <dig> in this cell line.figure  <dig>

in addition, the over-expression of mir-k12- <dig> did not affect the baseline expression of mir- <dig> in bjab cells but was repressive in tive cells .

rna samples for microarray analysis were collected from four biological replicates of bjab cells expressing mir-k12-11or mir- <dig>  tive cells expressing mir-k12- <dig>  and corresponding mock controls. all samples were successfully hybridized and showed statistical agreement among biological replicates . differentially expressed genes  were determined using paired comparisons with fdr <  <dig>  as the significance cutoff. among the total  <dig>  genes surveyed by the array,  <dig> were degs responsive to mir- <dig> in bjab cells, and mir-k12- <dig> affected  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes in bjab and tive cells, respectively . endogenous expression of mir- <dig> is expected to affect its target genes, and therefore few genes were expected to be differentially regulated by the addition of ectopic mir- <dig>  this, and the target specificity beyond the seed sequence, led to few overlapping degs between mir- <dig> and mir-k12- <dig> in bjab cells . the fold changes of the degs were mostly modest: 91% of the degs caused by mir-k12- <dig> had less than a 50% change at the rna level in tive cells . the effect was even more moderate in bjab cells, with 97% of the degs changing less than 50%. the small fold changes were consistent with previous reports  <cit>  that mirnas act as fine tuners of gene expression.table  <dig>

genes commonly affected by mir-k12- <dig> between bjab and tive were relatively few . we also compared our degs with multiple mir-155/mir-k12- <dig> perturbation studies . a similar study expressing mir-k12- <dig> in bjab transductants  <cit>  had 40% of the degs  shared by our mir-12- <dig> targets in bjab. no such studies have yet been carried out in endothelial cells. in other cell types, few overlapping genes were identified, likely because the tissue specific transcriptomes are different . these results demonstrated the tissue specificity of mirna target genes and the importance of targetome identification in relevant cell types.

direct targets of mirnas are expected to be repressed through sequence complementarity. we identified these genes as down-regulated degs that also contained seed matches, as predicted by a union of bioinformatics algorithms . the repression of four such genes was verified by qpcr. they are agtrap , apobec3g , samhd <dig>  and socs <dig>  . agtrap and samhd <dig> are validated targets of mir-k12- <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> is able to suppress socs <dig>  a suppressor of cytokine signaling  <cit>  and aid, a member of the same family of deaminases with critical functions in adaptive and innate immunity as apobec3g .

comparison between the computational target prediction and degs found only a small portion of the degs attributable to direct targeting. the number of up-regulated genes was about the same as the number down-regulated. down-regulated genes and predicted targets were associated in tive cells  . several factors may contribute to the predicted but not observed targets: false predictions by the bioinformatics algorithms; true targets that are tissue specific, false negatives for the tests of differential expression; or targets subject to translational control not measured by mrna profiling.

despite the limited overlap between degs in tive and bjab cells, mir-k12- <dig> targeted many common pathways in these two cell types . by comparing gene ontology  terms with degs using fisher’s exact test ”, we found carbohydrate metabolism among the top enriched pathways in both cell types . delgado et al.  <cit>  reported that kshv latent infection of endothelial cells strongly induced the warburg effect, the phenomenon that cancer cells increased glycolysis to meet their energy needs  <cit> . glycolysis was also identified as the top enriched biological process in a comprehensive mirna targetome analysis in kshv infected pel cells  <cit> . taken together, this evidence suggests that mir-k12- <dig> is an important regulator for the metabolic change after kshv infection in both endothelial and b cells.

effect of mir-k12- <dig> was amplified by transcription factors and protein interactions
go enrichment analysis identified sequence-specific transcription factors  and protein binding among the top molecular functions of direct mir-k12- <dig> targets in both bjab and tive cells , leading us to hypothesize that the indirect targets were produced by transcriptional regulation and protein interactions. enrichment of tfs in mirna targets have been reported for plants  <cit> , insects  <cit>  and human  <cit> . mirna regulation can control tf levels  and explains the importance of the 3′utr for the stability of tfs  <cit> . by binding to promoter elements and interacting with cofactors, tfs regulate the expression of a large number of genes and are able to amplify the effect of the initial mirna targeting event. while mirna regulation can result in an indirect effect of both up-regulation and down-regulation , negative regulators of gene expression are more context-dependent and difficult to prove. here we focused on the feed-forward grns in which the components consistently change towards the same direction.

in tive cells, we identified multiple cancer associated tfs that were down-regulated and thereby amplified the regulatory effects of mir-k12- <dig>  we identified cebpβ, e2f <dig>  pax <dig>  rela , and stat <dig> using a combination of degs and target prediction. cebpβ is a previously confirmed target for both mir- <dig> and mir-k12- <dig> in b cells and in the context of human hematopoiesis  <cit> . e2f <dig> is a master regulator of cell cycle. pax <dig> is involved in tissue specification during early development. rela promotes dna repair and resistance to apoptosis through the regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. stat <dig> is required for antiproliferative activity, immune surveillance and tumor suppression. repression of these key regulators involved in cancer by mir-k12- <dig> may help the establishment of latency and play a role in ks tumorigenesis. moderate down-regulation of these five tfs by mir-k12- <dig> should result in decreased expression of their downstream genes.

putative downstream targets of cebpβ, e2f <dig>  pax <dig>  rela and stat <dig> were identified based on screening for corresponding transcription factor binding sites within promoter regions using hmm algorithms  <cit> . initially,  <dig> to  <dig> putative tfbs were catalogued. genes that were not on the array, or were not expressed in mock transduced cells  were omitted. genes not differentially down regulated in the control vs mirk12- <dig> were also removed in order to focus specifically on genes that were responsive to ectopic microrna expression. due to the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression, tf binding is predominantly cell type specific  <cit> . the dnase-seq data on huvec cells  from the encode project enabled identification of active chromatin regions. genes that did not show dnase hypersensitivity were also filtered from our list of genes with tfbs as they lack tf accessibility. these filtering steps were applied to each of the lists generated from the preliminary prediction results in consideration of the cellular context and the lack of tissue specificity in computational prediction. after filtering,  <dig> genes were deemed possible targets of cebpβ,  <dig> for e2f <dig>   <dig> for pax <dig>   <dig> for rela, and  <dig> for stat <dig>  while all of these genes contained tfbs for the corresponding tf, more than 66% of these genes did not contain seed sequence matches for mir-k12- <dig>  therefore their down-regulation was unlikely to be due to direct targeting by mir-k12- <dig>  but through the repression of the tfs by mir-k12- <dig>  this analysis constructed the extended grns of mir-k12- <dig>  including the candidate direct targets of a small number of tfs and hundreds of downstream genes .figure  <dig> 
transcription factor binding sites  prediction for tfs directly targeted by mir-k12- <dig> in tive cells. mapper <dig> predicted thousands of genes with binding sites for each of the five tfs. a. all predicted sites with the genes not on the array, not expressed, or were not differentially expressed between mirk12- <dig> induction and control, or located in inactive chromatin regions according to encode data in blue and the genes that are targets of tfs in red  or green. b: genes containing tfbs and down-regulated can be further divided into two groups: those containing binding sites for both tf and mir-k12- <dig> , and those only containing tfbs but not seed sequences for mir-k12- <dig> .



co-occupancy of different tfs on promoters can form distinct functional regulatory complexes in a cell type specific manner. these complexes or regulatory modules are a mechanism especially common to pleiotropic tfs such as e2fs and stats  <cit> . we examined our context specific tfbs prediction, and found that co-localization of multiple tfs on promoters was frequent . putative co-binding of stat <dig> and e2f <dig> was identified for  <dig> down-regulated genes . rela and stat <dig> coocupied particularly frequent , consistent with data that activation of some genes requires binding of both stat <dig> and nfkb  <cit> .table  <dig>

a protein-protein interaction  pair can transmit the expression change of one protein that was repressed by the mirna to its interacting partner . combining tfbs with the ppi map provided more details for extending regulatory effects. for this purpose, we assembled the complete human protein interactome from intact  <cit>  and biogrid  <cit> . the complete interactome contains  <dig>  interacting pairs represented by  <dig>  genes. the connectivity and the neighbor numbers followed power law distribution . this comprehensive human ppi network contains all available gene identifiers as the focal genes and all genes that physically bind to each focal gene as its interacting genes. a focal gene and its directly interacting genes were defined as a subnetwork.

to refine the ppi for the specific biological context in this study, we integrated the curated interactome with our expression data, and removed nodes for genes not on our array and non-expressed genes from the ppi network. for each sub-network consisting of a node and all its interacting genes, the enrichment for down regulated targets of mir-k12- <dig> was tested. we found that the neighboring genes of e2f <dig> were enriched with genes down-regulated by mir-k12- <dig>  indicating that the sub-network was targeted . similar local enrichment for down regulated targets was also identified for non-tf proteins, like the apoptosis effector casp <dig> .figure  <dig> 
change of expression in the interacting genes with the five transcription factors. among the genes that directly interact with e2f <dig> , cebpb , pax <dig> , rela  and stat <dig> , there is an enrichment of down-regulation in accordance with the center node tf genes. protein interactions, as well as direct targeting of mir-k12- <dig>  may contribute to the coordinated down-regulation.



the degree of expression level changes for the effectors in bjab cells were more subtle . still, mir-k12- <dig> overexpression causes expression changes in more than  <dig> genes in addition to  <dig> directly targeted genes. tfs were identified from the putative direct targets, including e2f <dig>  a tf directly targeted by mir-k12- <dig> also in tive cells. to examine tf-dependent regulation affected by mir-k12- <dig> in bjab cells, we analyzed the promoter sequences of degs using rsat  <cit>  and tomtom  <cit> . from the set of down-regulated genes, e2f, sp <dig> and klf were identified as enriched motifs . these tfs contain the seed sequence of mir-k12- <dig>  supporting their roles as effector genes directly targeted by mir-k12- <dig>  these tfs are also transcriptional activators and the regulatory effect of mir-k12- <dig> is expected to cause a cascade of repression of transcription.figure  <dig> 
motif enrichment analysis from degs of bjab cells. motifs identified from the promoter sequences of genes down-regulated by mir-k12- <dig> in bjab cells matched the conserved binding motifs of sp <dig>  klf <dig> and myc. sp <dig> and klf <dig> were down-regulated themselves and may therefore relay the regulatory effect to a larger group of genes. for up-regulated genes in response to mir-k12- <dig>  motif of foxa <dig> and foxa <dig> were identified as putative mediators for the increase of gene expression in bjab cells.



mir-k12- <dig> synergistically regulated multiple signaling pathways to repress the activation of interferon responses
mir-k12- <dig> also regulates interferon responses and a variety of signaling pathways . signaling pathways have been suggested as logical targets of mirna regulation, where small changes in the expression level of upstream genes can affect the signal transduction cascade significantly  <cit> . individual mirnas are able to target several components of a single signaling pathway, as in the cases of mir- <dig> for wnt signaling  <cit> , mir- <dig> for rtk signaling  <cit>  and mir- <dig> for vegf signaling  <cit> . we identified multiple layers of jak-stat signaling that were affected by mir-k12- <dig>  with direct targets differing between bjab and tive cells . in bjab cells, the putative direct targets include the cytokine receptor ifngr <dig> , which is a confirmed target of mir- <dig>  <cit> . in tive cells, mir-k12- <dig> directly targeted socs <dig>  and the transcription activator stats  .figure  <dig> 
interferon responses were repressed via the interplay of multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors. mir-k12- <dig> targeted cytokine receptors and tfs, both of which affected a variety of interferon stimulated genes . through direct and indirect impact, mir-k12- <dig> is able to modulate the host innate immune response and to help kshv to establish latency.



interferons are potent cytokines produced in response to viral infection that mediate both innate immune response and subsequent development of adaptive immunity. modulation of interferon pathways is required to suppress the innate immune response and establish successful latent infection. along with jak-stat signaling, multiple other signaling pathways associated with interferon responses were targeted by mir-k12- <dig>  in tive cells, mir-k12- <dig> targets pten and akt1s <dig> of the akt pathway, ski and smad <dig> of the tgf-β signaling pathway, myd <dig> of the tlr-myd <dig> pathway which regulates host defense, and rela of the nf-κb signaling pathway .

the affected signaling pathways are not independent from each other but known to be coordinated through cross-talking  <cit> . the cooperation of stats and nf-κb can activate downstream antiviral genes such as the irfs, a family of transcription factors    <cit> . irfs and other tfs such as nf-κb and ap- <dig> complex  regulate the expression of interferons. besides their transcriptional activation property, stats also mediate the ifn response through competition with ap- <dig>  <cit> . in bjab cells, irf <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig> and atf <dig> were down-regulated by mir-k12- <dig> , but not likely through direct binding because they do not contain the seed sequence match sites.

in tive cells, a consistent decrease of expression levels was observed for stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and their transcriptionally regulated genes . rela and atf <dig>  which contain the seed sequence of mir-k12- <dig> and are down regulated are putative direct targets by mir-k12- <dig> . jund  and multiple irfs were also down-regulated through indirect effects. the decreased expression of irf <dig>  irf <dig> and irf <dig>  may be due to reduced stat levels since none of these irfs contain seed sequence matches . while rela expression is subject to the negative regulation of irf <dig>  we show that it is directly downregulated by mir-k12- <dig>  a similar functional loop has been reported for mir- <dig>  which by attenuating nf-κb activity, contributes to stabilization of ebv latency  <cit> . irf <dig> can also interact with stat dimers to form a protein complex to bind promoter sequences  <cit> . as important tfs, these reduced irfs likely affected a variety of downstream genes. a number of well characterized interferon stimulated genes  such as isg <dig>  usp <dig> and the oas gene family all exhibited significant down-regulation by mir-k12- <dig>  strongly supporting inhibition of interferon responses in endothelial cells .

liang et al.
 <cit>  has identified ikkϵ as a mir-k12- <dig> target in lung cancer cells. though ikkϵ level was unchanged in this experiment, its downstream effector irf and nf-κb were reduced. it is likely that mir-k12- <dig> attenuates ifn signaling by down-regulating multiple possible components, ikkϵ in lung cancer cells, ifngr <dig> in b cells, and stat <dig> in endothelial cells . targeting of these key components not only eliminated the activation of ifn response, but also increased key proliferative and survival signals that are beneficial for kshv latency establishment.

in addition to mir-k12- <dig>  kshv expresses homologs to cellular irfs, that prevent the association of irfs with their co-activators  <cit> . the inhibition imposed by mir-k12- <dig> and virf to cellular irfs may reinforce each other through a feedforward loop. while we cannot estimate the relative contribution of mir-k12- <dig> versus virf signaling, expressing a mirna comes with the added advantage of not eliciting humoral host immune responses like the protein products do. other kshv gene products such as v-cyclin and vil- <dig> are also cytokine signaling genes that can block the activity of host homologs  <cit> . taken together and in part due to mir-k12- <dig>  kshv is able to manipulate cell cycle and apoptosis, to evade immune response, and promote proliferation, and survival of infected cells.

CONCLUSIONS
analyzing grns provides insights into the regulatory networks of mirna regulation that cannot be found by studying single genes. examining mirna target genes in the context of cellular grns can separate targets that drive phenotypic consequences from non-functional ones. grns are highly tissue specific  <cit> , therefore it is imperative to recognize the tissue specificity and define the grns of the mirna only in the relevant cell types. we demonstrated a systems approach to infer the combinatorial grns utilized by mir-k12- <dig> in cellular contexts that are close to kshv infection in vivo. this study included the first target identification of kshv mirnas in tive cells, a frequently used endothelial cell culture system for studying kshv infection .

we found that mir-k12- <dig> functioned at different hierarchical levels of the grns. putative direct targets of mir-k12- <dig> were underrepresented in the altered transcriptomes. by targeting a few effector genes, five times more genes were affected beyond direct sequence pairing. different components, but frequently of common biological pathways, were targeted in bjab and tive cells. there was a preference to targeting tfs, including cebpβ, pax <dig>  rela, and stat <dig> in tive cells, foxa, klf and sp <dig> in bjab cells, and e2f <dig> common to both. decrease in the tf levels significantly amplified the effect of mir-k12- <dig> to many more genes downstream, which could potentially result in broad phenotypic effects such as inducing endothelial cell differentiation in the context of kshv infection. since viral mirnas co-evolve with host genes and can be functional orthologs, we found that like its cellular homolog mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-k12- <dig> is also involved in innate and adaptive immune functions by modulating the interferon response and carbohydrate metabolism. previously validated targets of mir- <dig> such as cebpβ and socs <dig> were also identified.

mir-k12- <dig> also regulated genes at the middle and bottom of the well-known signaling cascades, like signaling proteins and caspases, and modulated key biological processes like cell cycle control and various signaling pathways, all of which were accomplished by targeting distinct sets of genes within each cell type. host responses to viral infection, such as innate immunity and apoptosis, are countered by mir-k12- <dig> and additional viral gene products, enabling the establishment of latency. the multilevel regulation allowed one individual mirna to profoundly affect the gene expression program to adapt to specific needs.

finally, the approach we have taken here to identifying mir-k12- <dig> grns can be applied to investigating the viral and cellular mirnas in different tissues and systems. with an anticipated expansion of genome wide data on short rna profiles, chip, ribonomics, and proteomics in the near future, our strategy could be applied to reveal conditional regulatory pathways in a highly tissue and cell type specific manner.
