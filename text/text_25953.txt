BACKGROUND
degradation of extracellular matrix , as mediated by matrix metalloproteinases  and antagonized by tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases , is critical for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis  <cit> . conversely, uncontrolled ecm degradation occurs in many degenerative diseases  <cit> . for instance, excessive presence of mmps has been well documented in cancer dissemination, arthritis development, and chronic wound progression  <cit> . among the twenty-some members of the mmp family in either the human or murine genome the proteinases can be classified not only based on their structural conservation, but also by the means of their expression. of our interest for many years is the regulation of mmp- <dig>  a type-iv collagenase in tissue injury and repair. not expressed in most of adult developed tissues, mmp- <dig> is promptly expressed in response to tissue damages under the control of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . nascent prommp- <dig> is maintained in latency through interaction between a conserved cysteine in the pro-peptide domain and a zinc atom in the catalytic domain. furthermore, tnf-α-induced maturation of prommp- <dig> by skin cells is mediated by down regulation of timp- <dig>  while the converting enzymes are seemingly constitutively present  <cit> . recently we uncovered alpha-1-antichymotrypsin  as a novel pathological inhibitor that directly antagonizes the prommp- <dig> converting enzyme in skin tissues  <cit> . thus, generation of active mmp- <dig> within tissues is tightly monitored at the levels of gene expression, protein processing, and antagonization by inhibitors targeting at either prommp- <dig>  or converting enzyme .

innate immunity and its produced waves of inflammatory cytokines are the initial signals to trigger expression of mmps in tissue injury phase. compelling evidence of in vitro experiments also demonstrates the critical roles of inflammatory cytokines in control of mmp expression and activation. intracellular signals governing the expression of mmps have been extensively studied; among them, jun n-terminal kinase  and nuclear factor kappa b  signaling pathways are essential to induce many mmps  <cit> . still outstanding is that how other extracellular cue, such as ecm, in cooperation with pro-inflammatory cytokines control mmp expression, of which is particularly critical for mesenchymal cells. for instance, in addition to tnf-α or il- <dig>  the 3-dimentional type-i collagen is also required to maximally induce mmp- <dig> by either human dermal fibrobaslts or rat hepatic stellate cells  <cit> .

p21-activatd kinase , a family of serine/threonine kinases conserved from yeast to human, is important for regulation of cytoskeleton, cell migration, and cell cycle progression  <cit> . pak <dig> was originally identified through its binding to p <dig> gtpase  <cit> . like many other protein kinases, pak <dig> retains inactive by its own pseudo-substrate like domain, and is activated by binding gtp-charged proteins, which consequently leads conformational changes and auto-phosphorylation. non-canonically, pak <dig> can be phosphorylated and activated by pdk <dig> which phosphorylates a conserved threonine- <dig> within the active loop  <cit> . in addition to regulating cytoskeletal proteins, pak <dig> also controls map kinases, such as jnk and p <dig> map kinases  <cit> . furthermore, pak <dig> also modulate nf-κb activity  <cit> . although the dynamics of cytoskeleton and the formation of stress filaments are critical for cell-matrix interactions in inflammation, very little is known if and how inflammatory cytokines regulate pak <dig> in control of mmp expression.

in this study we demonstrated an unrecognized mechanism by which tnf-α activates pak <dig> by a sequential phosphorylation from threonine- <dig> to threonine- <dig> in human epithelial cells and fibroblasts. similarly, il-1α also promotes pak <dig> activation in rat hepatic stellate cells. moreover, tnf-α treatment promptly results in accumulation of pak <dig> protein, but not p <dig> map kinase, in part by stabilization of the former. although the details are unknown to date, tnf-α-mediated stabilization of pak <dig> is independent of its catalytic activity and p <dig> gtpase binding capacities. ectopic expression of pak <dig> variants impairs jnk but not nf-κb pathway, which in turn suppresses the promoter activation and transcription of mmp- <dig>  expression of other mmps such as mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> as well as timp- <dig> is, in contrast, not affected by pak <dig>  we also characterized the differences of mmp- <dig> expression between human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. for keratinocytes, tnf-α or il- <dig> is sufficient to induce mmp- <dig>  while mesenchymal cells such as dermal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells require type-i collagen as an additional factor which boosts jnk activity to maximally induce mmp- <dig> 

RESULTS
cytokine-induced expression of mmp- <dig> by human skin is partially reconstituted by primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts
first, we surveyed the expression pattern of gelatinases by biopsies from patients with non-healed chronic  or healed wounds, as well as normal skin tissue. as shown in fig. 1a, massive amount of prommp- <dig>  and mature form  were evident in non-healed wounds, while minimal level of the proteinase was found in healed and normal skin tissues. conversely, low level of prommp- <dig> was evenly expressed by all three skin samples, while mature mmp- <dig> was found in both healed and non-healed skin. excessive expression of mmp- <dig> in non-healed skin is associated with persistent inflammation in chronic wounds. to confirm the notion, isolated human dermal fibroblasts at the early passages  were cultured on plastic, or embedded in 3-d type-i collagen. cultured on plastic, dermal fibroblasts expressed a minimal level of prommp- <dig> in response to tnf-α; under the combination of tnf-α and tgf-β, the fibroblasts produced massive prommp- <dig> . only in 3d type-i collagen, the fibroblasts also generated mature mmp- <dig> in response to the combination of tnf-α and tgf-β. we also measured the steady state of mmp- <dig> mrna level. dermal fibroblasts cultured on plastic or in 3d collagen gel were exposed to tnf-α, tgf-β, and their combination for  <dig> hrs, and the mrna level of mmp- <dig> was determined by real-time rt-pcr. as shown, the mrna gives almost identical ranking of expression as to the protein levels, demonstrating that the regulation of mmp- <dig> by tnf-α and collagen is mostly at the mrna level . thus, multiple extracellular cues including combination of two drastic different cytokines, tnf-α and tgf-β, and ecm render the dermal fibroblasts to generate maximal level of mmp- <dig>  implying a situation in inflaming tissues.

primary human keratinocytes produced minimal level of prommp- <dig> in response to tnf-α, and the expression was also additionally enhanced in concert with tgf-β . of note are two clear distinguished features between the dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in terms of mmp- <dig> expression. first, ecm has a profound role to induce mmp- <dig> expression by dermal fibroblasts but not keratinocytes . second, mmp- <dig>  a mesenchymal mmp is largely absent in keratinocytes. taken together, both the keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of human skin may contribute to the massive expression of mmp- <dig> under the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines in inflammation.

pak <dig> mediates tnf-α-induced expression of mmp- <dig> but not mmp-2
to elucidate the intracellular signaling to govern mmp expression we transduced human dermal fibroblasts with lentivirus to express gfp, pak <dig> wild type, pak <dig> triple mutant , and pak <dig> k299r mutant  respectively. the viral transduced dermal fibroblastic cell lines were then embedded in type-i collagen, followed by tnf-α stimulation at the indicated dose for  <dig> days. gelatinases in conditioned medium were resolved by zymography. strikingly, the expression of prommp- <dig> induced by the synergistic action of tnf-α and collagen was totally suppressed by pak <dig> variants, but not gfp which works as a negative control . the specific effects of pak <dig> on mmp- <dig> expression were evident by the absence of regulation on the expression of prommp- <dig> as well as the maturation of the zymogen . the wild-type pak <dig> at the situation of over expression partially ablated mmp- <dig> expression, which may due to blockage of signaling traffics under over-expression . thereafter, we measured the steady state of mmp- <dig> mrna by the human fibroblasts expressing either gfp or pak <dig> mutant  cultured on plastic or in 3d type-i collagen. after  <dig> hr treatment by either tnf-α or tgf-β, as well as their combination, the mmp- <dig> mrna was determined by real-time rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 2b, induction of mmp- <dig> mrna at all these conditions was totally impaired by the kinase inactive pak <dig>  finally, we measured the effect of pak <dig> on the 5'-promoter activity of the mmp- <dig> gene. the 5' promoter activities of mmp- <dig> were measured by dual luciferase assay through transfection of dermal fibroblasts with a reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase driven by a 670-bp 5'-promoter of mmp- <dig>  while the control was monitored by renilla luciferase driven by cmv promoter. as shown in fig. 2c the cytokine-induced activation of mmp- <dig> promoter was impaired by the pak <dig> mutant.

tnf-α-induced stabilization of the ectopically expressed pak <dig> protein
we then addressed the nature of tnf-α regulation of pak <dig>  first, we analyzed the cell lines constitutively expressing pak <dig> driven the viral promoter. after  <dig> days of tnf-α exposure the protein level of the ectopically expressed pak <dig> was unexpectedly elevated, indicating a possible mechanism by which tnf-α signaling results in stabilization of pak <dig> protein . importantly, the tnf-α induced accumulation of pak <dig> protein is independent of the kinase activities and p <dig> gtpase binding, as measured by the similar elevation of the variants of k299r and the triple mutant in response to tnf-α. measurement at fine time points demonstrated again the prompt mode of elevation of the ectopically expressed pak <dig> after tnf-α treatment . because the ectopically expressed pak <dig> is driven by constitutively active viral promoter, the tnf-α induced elevation of the kinase is, therefore, likely mediated by stabilization of the protein. to strengthen the notion we treated the dermal fibroblasts with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis and to monitor the degradation of the kinase. under  <dig> μg/ml of cycloheximide, which sufficiently suppresses many protein syntheses, the pak <dig> protein was still elevated under tnf-α treatment, demonstrating that the cytokine-dependent elevation of pak <dig> is mediated by stabilization .

immortalized human keratinocytes  were also transduced by the same set of lentiviruses, and the cells were treated by cytokines for  <dig> days. as shown in fig. 3a, prommp- <dig> was abundantly induced by ikc transduced by the wild type pak <dig> virus in response to tnf-α but not tgf-β stimulation. conversely, the tnf-α induced expression of prommp- <dig> was partially abolished by the cells expressing the kinase-negative pak <dig> variants. similar to the fibroblasts, the protein levels of the wild type pak <dig> in the keratinocyte was clearly enhanced by tnf-α treatment . taken together, we demonstrated a novel regulation of pak <dig> by tnf-α, which is mediated by an unknown mechanism to stabilize the pak <dig> protein.

expression of mmp- <dig>  but not mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  is specifically controlled by pak1
the intriguing regulation of mmp- <dig> by pak <dig> as shown in fig. 2a prompted us to examine regulation of other mmps. dermal fibroblasts transduced by lentivirus expressing gfp or inactive pak <dig>  were embedded in 3d type-i collagen. after  <dig> days of stimulation with cytokines, the secreted mmp- <dig> in conditioned medium was measured by western blot analysis. as shown in fig. 4a, tnf-α, but not tgf-β, induced mmp- <dig>  while combination of the two cytokines promoted synergistic induction of mmp- <dig>  in a manner very similar to mmp- <dig> expression. however, in a drastic contrast to mmp- <dig>  the cytokine-induced mmp- <dig> expression is not affected by over expression of pak <dig> variants. the mrna levels of mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and timp- <dig> were measured by real-time rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 4b, after  <dig> hr stimulation the mrna of mmp- <dig> was induced  <dig> folds by tnf-α and additionally enhanced by the combination with tgf-β, which is closely correlated to mmp- <dig> protein expression. the cytokine-mediated induction of these mmps was not altered by forcedly expressed pak <dig>  in a similar fashion, the low level expression of the mrna of mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  and timp- <dig> was also not altered by pak <dig>  again, pak <dig> variants thoroughly suppressed the cytokine-exerted mmp- <dig> mrna elevation. these results clearly demonstrate a specific mode of pak <dig> in regulation of mmp- <dig> expression.

jnk, but neither p <dig> map kinase nor pi <dig> kinase, is downstreamof pak <dig> to promote mmp- <dig> expression
jnk signaling has been well defined as a key regulator to initiate the transcription of many mmps including mmp- <dig>  <cit> . to probe the possible role of jnk in cytokine-induced mmp- <dig> expression, we treated human dermal fibroblasts in 3d type-i collagen or on plastic by inhibitors for jnk , p <dig> map kinase , and pi- <dig> kinase  at the effective concentration suggested by the manufacture. after  <dig> days of culture with tnf-α and/or tgf-β, the conditioned medium was examined for gelatinase activities. as shown in fig. 5a, the cytokine-induced mmp- <dig> was suppressed thoroughly by the jnk inhibitor, although the inhibition efficacy was slightly lower by the cells cultured in 3d gel, which may be due to the adsorption or trap of the compound in the scaffold of ecm. expression of prommp- <dig>  and maturation to the active form  were clearly not altered by the jnk inhibitor, indicating specific inhibition and absence of general cellular toxicity. in contrast, the inhibitors for p38map kinase and pi <dig> kinase were found without effects on mmp- <dig> expression. activation of jnk by fibroblasts ectopically expressing pak <dig> variants was measured by antibody against p <dig> and p <dig> sapk/jnk dually phosphorylated at thr <dig> and tyr <dig> . after  <dig> min treatment with cytokines jnk was phosphorylated in response to tnf-α by the controlled cells , and largely abrogated by the cells expressing inactive pak <dig>  .

in addition to jnk and nf-κb pathways, tnf-α also activates p38map kinase, which prompted us to examine its role in regulation of mmp- <dig> expression. human dermal fibroblasts transduced by lentivius expressing p38map kinase or the dominant negative variant; and the resultant cells were cultured either on plastic or in 3d gel followed by treatment with cytokines. as shown in fig. 6a, cytokine-mediated prommp- <dig> expression was not altered by p38map kinase, which is in line with the results of the inhibition experiment . in contrast, mmp- <dig>  but not mmp- <dig> expression, was totally suppressed by inactive pak <dig>  moreover, protein stability of the ectopically expressed p38map kinase was not regulated by tnf-α . thus, jnk <dig> is likely to be a downstream effector of pak <dig> as demonstrated previously by others  <cit> , and we showed here such moiety in the tnf-α signaling to control mmp- <dig> expression.

not regulated by pak <dig>  nf-κb signaling is essentialfor mmp- <dig> expression
many studies have demonstrated the role of nf-κb in regulation of mmps including mmp- <dig> by directly recruitment of nf-κb to the cis-elements in the 5'-promoter of mmp- <dig>  <cit> . of interest is to know if nf-κb signaling is also under control by pak <dig>  activation of nf-κb was measured by degradation of its inhibitor, ikappab-α by the fibroblasts under the context of gfp, pak <dig> , p38map kinase and its dominant negative variant. after  <dig> min of stimulation with tnf-α, ikappab-α was promptly up-shifted, presumably through hyper-phosphorylation . at  <dig> min after the challenge the ikappab-α was totally diminished by all these cells. thus, in contrast to jnk, nf-κb is independent of pak <dig> signaling. to confirm the notion of requirement of nf-κb we treated the fibroblasts with inhibitor for ikk, and measured the mrna and protein of mmp- <dig>  as shown in fig. 7b and 7c, the cytokine-induced expression of mmp- <dig> at both mrna and protein levels was partially suppressed by the ikk inhibitor. conversely, expression of mmp- <dig> was not affected by the inhibitor. thus, nf-κb signaling is required, but not under control by pak <dig>  to induce mmp- <dig> expression.

phosphorylation, activation, and stabilization of endogenous pak <dig> in response to tnf-α/il-1α
given the evidence of stabilization of the ectopically expressed pak <dig> by tnf-a signaling, and regulation of mmp- <dig> expression by the kinase, an immediate question is, therefore, to what extend the endogenous pak <dig> is actually activated and stabilized in response to tnf-α. as shown in fig. 8a, the doublet bands of endogenous pak <dig> were immediately elevated after  <dig> min treatment of keratinocytes by tnf-α, and the pak <dig> protein was substantially accumulated at  <dig> min. a band at  <dig> kda, also recognized by the antibodies for pak <dig>  a presumable degradation product at basal state, was gradually diminished, whereas the full length pak <dig> accumulated after tnf-α treatment, indicating a possible mechanism that tnf-α suppresses the turnover of pak <dig>  as an internal control, two bands at about 45-kda were constitutively expressed in a mode independent of tnf-α. as a general way to activate a protein kinase, a site within the pseudo-substrate loop in the catalytic domain is phosphorylated in response to stimulation  <cit> . phosphorylation of pak <dig> at threonine- <dig> has been demonstrated as an indicator for activation state of the kinase  <cit> . in response to tnf-α, phosphorylation of threonine- <dig>  as measured by antibodies for the phosphopeptide, promptly appeared at  <dig> min, and peaked at  <dig> min . pak <dig> can also be phosphorylated at threonine- <dig> presumably by cdc2/cdk <dig>  <cit> . as shown in fig. 8c, threonine- <dig> phosphorylation occurred maximally at  <dig> min after tnf-α stimulation, prior to the threonine- <dig> phosphorylation.

we then fractioned cellular compartments, and found that most of pak <dig> protein and the threonine- <dig> phosphorylated version being present in cytosolic fractions rather than in the membrane pools. similarly, threonine- <dig> of pak <dig> was phosphorylated in dermal fibroblasts in response to tnf-α stimulation but in the prompt manner as in the keratinocytes . importantly, fibroblasts over expressing pak <dig> variants failed to show threonine- <dig> phosphorylation, which sufficiently explains its role in the impairment of the signaling in mmp- <dig> expression . similar to keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts expressing gfp showed prompt phosphorylation of threonine- <dig> in response to tnf-α . we were interested to know whether pak <dig> can be activated by il- <dig>  which shares many signaling pathways with tnf-α. our previous work showed that the hepatic stellate cells can vigorously produce both prommp- <dig> and the mature proteinase in response to il- <dig> stimulation only by the cells cultured in type-i collagen  <cit> . as expected, in the rat hepatic stellate cells, pak <dig> underwent phosphorylation at threorine- <dig> , followed by phosphorylation at threorine- <dig>  . taken together, through analysis of these three cell types we found that under tnf-α stimulation pak <dig> is phosphorylated in a dynamics starting at threonine- <dig> followed by threonine- <dig> phophorylation, which confers the kinase to an active state. given the fact of failed activation of pak <dig> by the variants, and the evidence of their equal stabilization by these pak <dig> variants, the tnf-α induced stabilization of pak <dig> is, therefore, very likely independent of the kinase activation mechanism.

contribution of collagen to tnf-α-induced mmp- <dig> expression by fibroblasts is associated with persistent activation ofjnk
it still remains outstanding how ecm boosts the tnf-α signaling to induce mmps by the mesenchymal cells in tissue environment, as shown in fig.  <dig>  first, we examined whether collagen can boost the jnk signaling, for the reason, in part, of its role in mmp- <dig> regulation, and under the pak <dig> signaling. our previous work also demonstrated additive stimulation of the minimal promoter of human mmp- <dig> by collagen and tnf-α, while the convergences between the tnf-α and collagen signals are not known  <cit> . thus far, we examined the influence of collagen on the kinetics of jnk activation by human dermal fibroblasts. cells were cultured on plastic or in type-i collagen to measure the strength and speed of the response. as shown in fig.  <dig>  phosphorylation of both jnk <dig> and jnk <dig> promptly occurred at  <dig> min after tnf-α challenge, reached to peaks at  <dig> min, and followed by gradual decline. although collagen alone could not trigger jnk activation, it did magnify the amplitude of jnk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. densitometry scanning revealed a two-fold enhancement of phospho-jnk1/ <dig> by the cells cultured in type-i collagen. therefore, the synergistic effect of collagen to cooperate with tnf-α in induction of mmp- <dig> can be explained, at least in part, by the amplification of jnk activities.

discussion
expressed in early embryonic development, mmp- <dig> is largely silent in many adult tissues; while mmp- <dig>  another member of the gelatinase family, is constitutively expressed in health tissues. however, upon injury such as mechanical trauma, thermal burn, and viral infection, mmp- <dig> is promptly elevated, indicating its role in wound healing by activating the stromal cells, releasing growth factors, and initiating cell migration. on the other hand, persistent presence of large amount of mmps is often associated with, if not results in, many inflammatory diseases such as chronic wounds, arthritis, and cancer metastasis. despite large body of efforts to discover the intracellular signal pathways to control mmps in variety of cells, little is known as to how ecm in cooperating with the cytokine signals regulates mmp expression, particularly by the mesenchymal cells. in ecm scaffolds the mesenchymal cells are intensified by the intracellular cytoskeletal networks which are essential for cell anchoring, migration, and proliferation in the waves of cytokines during wound healing processes. organization of intracellular cytoskeletal framework is largely orchestrated by small gtpases and their down stream effectors. to these regards, we investigated the role of pak <dig> in regulation of mmps by three cell types from msenchymal to epithelial cells. in summary, we have found  tnf-α triggers a sequential phosphorylation events in pak <dig>  starting at threonine- <dig> followed by threonine- <dig>  which may confers the kinase into active state;  tnf-α promptly elevates pak <dig> protein level, presumably through stabilization, which is independent on the kinase activity and p <dig> gtpase binding capacity;  tnf-α induced expression of mmp- <dig> is mediated by pak1/jnk pathway which controls transcriptional initiation of mmp- <dig> promoter.

originally identified as targets by gtp-loaded p <dig> protein, pak family with  <dig> members has been demonstrated to serve as important regulators in cytoskeletal dynamic and cell motility, presumably through phosphorylation of the downstream substrates such as lim kinase and myosin light chain kinase  <cit> . like many protein kinases, pak <dig> activity is restrained in latency by formation of homodimer through the interaction between the kinase inhibitory domain and the catalytic activation loop, which prevents the kinase from access the substrates  <cit> . the first step to provoke activation of pak <dig> is believed to disrupt such trans-inhibition interaction, which can be conducted by variant ways such as binding of p <dig> gtpase, partial cleavage by caspase, association with sphingolipids, and phosphorylation  <cit> . the second step is to maintain the "opened" status by auto-phosphorylation at theronine- <dig> of the active loop in catalytic domain  <cit> . on the other hand, it is unknown whether inflammatory cytokines regulate paks, and how such regulation controls mmp in inflammation process.

in this study we first assessed the contribution of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes to the massive expression of mmp- <dig> by non-healing skin tissues. although both dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes produce mmp- <dig> in response to tnf-α/il- <dig>  dermal fibroblasts require type-i collagen as additional factor to maximally induce the proteinase, which makes pathophysiological sense as a paradigm between an enzyme and its substrate in a mutual demanding in order to maintain tissue homeostasis . still unknown is how tgf-β in concert with tnf-α enhances mmp- <dig> expression by fibroblasts of human and rodent skin, while tgf-β alone is not sufficient to induce the proteinase  <cit> . according to present results, tgf-β is unable to cooperate with tnf-α to activate jnk or nf-κb pathway . however, the magnified activation of jnk by the dermal fibroblasts cultured on type-i collagen as shown in fig.  <dig> may explain, at least in part, the role of tgf-β through the capacious capacity to induce of type-i collagen . the role of tgf-β is surely cell-type specific and depends on the context of other signaling, as we found tgf-β suppresses the il-1-induced expression of mmps by hepatic stellate cells  <cit> .

still intriguing is how mmp- <dig>  but not mmp- <dig>  is specifically subjected to pak <dig> control under the same tnf-α treatment . the suppression of mmp- <dig> expression by pak <dig> can be attributed, in part, to the transcription activation, since the ectopically expressed pak <dig> mutant impairs the proximal 5'-promoter activities of mmp- <dig>  and completely suppresses the accumulation of the mrna and protein of mmp- <dig>  such suppression is in line with the impaired activation of jnk, but not nf-κb . this notion is further reinforced by our inhibition experiment, by which jnk inhibitor thoroughly disrupts expression of mmp- <dig> . clues of pak <dig> in regulates map kinase come from the work on yeast mating as well as reconstitution experiments  <cit> . in addition to jnk, pak <dig> has been shown to induce activation of p <dig> map kinase pathways  <cit> . in our study, neither expression of p <dig> map kinase variants nor inhibition with specific inhibitor for the kinase does affect the mmp- <dig> at all .

it is unknown, to date, how tnf-α promotes activation of pak <dig> protein  <cit> . phosphorylation of thronine- <dig> in the active loop has been demonstrated as an indicator for activation of pak <dig>  <cit> . in addition to p <dig> gtpase binding and thereafter induced auto-phosphorylation of pak <dig>  pdk was also found to phosphorylate thronine- <dig> of pak <dig>  <cit> . in this study we found tnf-α exerts sequential phosphorylation of pak <dig>  started at thronine- <dig>  and followed by thronine- <dig> phosphorylation . following pak <dig> activation is the accumulation of the protein of the kinase per se. we concluded that tnf-α induced accumulation of pak <dig> is regulated at post-transcriptional level. such conclusion is based on the following evidences:  cycloheximide, which suppresses protein synthesis in general, does not affect pak <dig> protein under tnf-α stimulation;  the constitutively expressed pak <dig> under viral promoter is also up regulated by tnf-α, and as a control the p <dig> map kinase is not altered at all, which strongly supports the mechanism of protein stabilization;  up regulation of pak <dig> by tnf-α or il- <dig> seems ubiquitous, since it is detected by human dermal fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, as well as rat hepatic stellate cells;  tnf-α induced accumulation of 66-kda pak <dig> is inversely correlated with the loss of the degradation band at 25-kda . all these indicate that tnf-α may somehow attenuate the degradation of pak <dig> protein. clearly, the tnf-α induced stabilization of pak <dig> is independent of its intrinsic kinase and p <dig> gtpase-binding capacity. most of pak <dig> is compartmented in cytosolic pool, of which is promptly induced by tnf-α; while the kinase in the membrane fractions is not regulated . to date, it is unknown how tnf-α regulates pak <dig> stability.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a novel mechanism of mmp- <dig> expression controlled by tnf-α through stabilization and activation of pak <dig> which in turn activates jnk pathway leading the transcription of mmp- <dig>
