BACKGROUND
many factors related to genome size, recombination rate, expression level, and effective population size, among others, have been proposed to affect the evolution of gene structure  <cit> . at the molecular level, genome size variations may result from mobile or transposable elements , whole genome duplication events, and polyploidization events, among others. comparative studies have shown that intron lengths and the abundance of mobile elements directly correlate with genome size, such that large genomes have longer introns and a higher proportion of mobile elements  <cit> . mobile elements also impact gene structure and function as they can insert into genes, including introns and exons, and thus contribute to the evolution of genes.

conifer trees have very large genomes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> gbp  <cit>  that are composed of a large fraction of repetitive sequences  <cit> . new insight into plant genome evolution are expected from the unique structure and history of conifer genomes  <cit> , which may contribute to a broader understanding of the relationships between gene structure and genome architecture. draft genome assemblies were recently reported for the european picea abies   <cit>  as well as the north american species picea glauca   <cit>  and pinus taeda   <cit> . nystedt et al.  <cit>  reported that norway spruce and other conifers accumulate long introns and showed that some introns can be very long  compared to other plant species.

a positive relationship between genome size and intron length has been observed in broad phylogenetic studies  <cit>  including between recently diverged drosophila species harboring considerable difference in genome size, where d. viliris had longer introns than d. melanogaster <cit> . in plants, a few studies investigated this question within angiosperms, indicating that genome size is not necessarily a good predictor of intron length  <cit>  although a general trend is observed. for instance, arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa, zea mays have well characterized genomes that range in size from  <dig> mbp to  <dig>  gbp; their average exons sizes are between  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas their introns sizes are  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp on average, respectively  <cit> . the length of introns may depend upon gene function and expression level; however, there is considerable debate surrounding this issue when it comes to plant genomes. in oryza sativa and a. thaliana it was found that highly expressed genes contained more and longer introns than genes expressed at a low level  <cit> , which is in contrast to findings in caenorhabditis elegans and homo sapiens <cit> .

transposable elements are among the factors that may influence the evolution of intron size, as they represent the major component of plant genomes  <cit> . in vitis vinifera, transposable elements comprise 80% of long introns  <cit> . in many plants, ltr-rt represent a large fraction of the genome but are more abundant in gene poor regions of the genome; therefore, their impact on the evolution of gene structure may actually be lesser than other classes of transposable elements such as mites  <cit>  and helitrons, both of which are known to insert into or close to genes  <cit> .

to date, studies related to genome size and the evolution of plant introns have primarily involved angiosperms , many of which have genomes under  <dig> gbp. more recently, the picea abies and pinus taeda genomes were shown to have among the largest average introns size  <cit> . we aimed to develop an understanding of the gene structure in conifers through a detailed analysis of individual genes with a particular emphasis on the potential impact of long introns on gene structure trough comparative analyses. an underlying question relates to potential impacts on gene expression; therefore, our analyses took into account their expression profiles. gene structure was analyzed in two conifers  and three angiosperms. we explored three main hypothesis:  intron length is the major type of variation affecting gene structure in conifers compared to other plant species;  there is a positive relationship between genome size and intron length in p. glauca compared to a. thaliana, z. mays and p. trichocarpa;  p. glauca and p. taeda present a conserved gene structure despite the fact that they diverged over  <dig> mya in keeping with their low rate of genome evolution  <cit> .

we present a detailed analysis of gene structure for  <dig> genes from the conifer picea glauca obtained from bac sequencing and genome assembly and comparative analyses with a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and z. mays. our study also included the analysis of nearly  <dig> gene sequences obtained from sequence capture aiming to explore the potential impact of repetitive sequences on intron size in p. glauca. our findings show that intron size and the position of long introns within genes is variable between plant lineages but highly conserved in conifers.

RESULTS
genomic sequences
genomic sequences were analyzed for several p. glauca genes. the sequences were obtained either by targeted bac isolations, from an early assembly of the p. glauca genome  <cit> , or from a sequence capture experiment .

a total of  <dig> bac clones were isolated each containing a different single copy gene associated with secondary cell-wall formation or with nitrogen metabolism. following shotgun sequencing by gs-flx and assembly with the newbler software, the integrity and identity of each gene was verified. estimated size of bac clones was  <dig> kb on average and coverage was 144× . twenty of the  <dig> targeted genes were complete as determined by sequence alignment indicating full coverage of fl cdna sequences from spruces and pines   <cit>  . nearly all genes were contained within a single contig, except the lim gene which lacked one exon, and the susy gene which was complete cdna sequence but spanned two contigs. none of bacs contained other genes as determined by blast searches against the p. glauca gene catalog  <cit>  and the swiss prot database.

sequences were also isolated from a whole genome shotgun assembly of p. glauca <cit> . sequences with ubiquitous expression were targeted in order to complement the set of more specialized genes which had been selected for bac isolation. the p. glauca genome shotgun assembly was screened with the complete cds derived from cdna sequences  that were highly expressed in most tissues . a total of  <dig> genomic sequences were randomly selected among those that spanned the entire coding region of the targeted gene.

gene expression profiles
transcript accumulation profiles from eight different tissues were obtained from the piceagenexpress database  <cit>  for each of the gene sequences described above . the transcript data indicated that the group of highly expressed genes was detected in all tissues and with average abundance class above  <dig>   across all tissues . in contrast, the genes associated with wood formation and nitrogen metabolism nearly all had tissue preferential expression patterns; they were detected in six tissues on average  and had an average transcript abundance class of  <dig>  in those tissues where the genes were expressed .

gene structures and comparative analysis with angiosperms
the gene structure  of p. glauca genes was determined by mapping the complete cdna onto the genomic sequence  for  <dig> genes. homologs were retrieved from three well-characterized angiosperm genomes, arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , populus trichocarpa <cit>  and zea mays <cit> . the comparative analyses considered all of the genes together and also as two separate groups, i.e. genes highly expressed and genes related to secondary cell-wall formation and nitrogen metabolism. on average, the protein coding sequence similarity between p. glauca and a. thaliana was 76%, 78% with p. trichocarpa and 75% with z. mays.

the number of exons and introns was well conserved between homologous genes among the different species . the average length of exons was also well conserved between homologs among species  and varied only slightly between the two sub-groups genes . pairwise comparisons of matching exons also indicated conservation of length among the species considered . these observations indicate that exon structure is generally well conserved.

2data were obtained from  <dig> different genes and an average total of  <dig> exons per species.

in contrast, introns revealed much more variation between species. our analyses included comparisons of individual introns and of total intronic sequences in each gene. the average length of individual introns  was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa, z. mays and p. glauca, respectively . the average intron length varied significantly among p. glauca and the three species; pairwise contrasts were significant with a. thaliana and z. mays, and nearly significant with p. trichocarpa . in p. glauca, p. trichocarpa and z. mays, we also observed that intron lengths were more heterogeneous as shown by differences between low and upper quartiles, minimum and maximum lengths and outliers of large size . the average length of the longest intron per gene was  <dig> bp in a. thaliana,  <dig> bp in p. trichocarpa , <dig> bp in z. mays and  <dig> bp in p. glauca.

comparison of the total length of intronic sequences on a gene-by-gene basis showed that on average, p. glauca genes had  <dig>  times more intronic sequences than a. thaliana,  <dig>  times more than p. trichocarpa and  <dig>  times more than z. mays . the total length of intron sequences and length ratio was calculated for each gene in pairwise comparisons between all of the species. comparisons between p. glauca and a. thaliana gene sets were statistically significant ; the ratios were close to five on average in highly expressed genes and three in genes associated with secondary cell-wall formation and nitrogen metabolism . in contrast, the ratio of total intron lengths between p. glauca compared to p. trichocarpa and z. mays was constant at around two-fold and the total length of intronic sequence per gene was not statistically different. results also indicated that a. thaliana has significantly less intronic sequence than p. trichocarpa and z. mays and that their ratios were most different for the highly expressed genes and more similar for the genes involved in secondary cell-wall formation and nitrogen metabolism . a significant difference of intron lengths was also observed between the two expression groups within p. glauca .

the variation in the ratios of total intron sequence per genes was quite striking, for both of the gene expression groups . for instance, depending on the gene, the ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  this high level of heterogeneity in pairwise comparisons is likely to account for the lack of statistically significant differences. in addition, the intron length ratios were not consistent across species .

in this study, we show that much of the divergence in the total length of intron sequences per gene was related to a few long introns. very long introns were observed in a few p. glauca genes such as phd, peptidase_c <dig> and thiolase. structure plots showed that introns in a. thaliana generally had uniform lengths whereas the other species had introns that were highly heterogeneous in lengths . while most of the p. glauca genes only had a few  very long introns , gene sequences such as those for sucrose synthase  had many introns of moderate size . the longest introns in p. glauca were most often in a different position than long z. mays and p. trichocarpa introns. in addition, we did not observe a trend of increased length in first introns in 5′ utrs as reported for several eukaryotes  <cit> , as the long introns in p. glauca appeared to be randomly distributed.

comparative analysis of gene structures between picea glauca and pinus taeda
a total of  <dig> different genes were submitted to pairwise comparisons between picea glauca and pinus taeda, which are both of the pinaceae . a high level of similarity was observed for coding sequences  indicating that they were likely orthologous genes , and gene structure was conserved between the two conifers, with almost identical numbers of exons. the total intronic sequences per gene did not vary significantly at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp for p. glauca and p. taeda, respectively . pairwise comparison of introns indicated that the majority of individual introns were similar in length in the two species, despite the fact that the two genera diverged ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  . although these observations are based on a set of only  <dig> genes, they provide an indication that intron length is mostly conserved between these two conifer genera.

the  <dig> intron sequences of the  <dig> genes  were aligned between spruce and pine; sequence similarity ranged quite broadly among homologous introns .we observed that highly conserved introns generally were short, and that longer introns had highly variables levels of sequence similarity, except for two introns that were both long and highly conserved.

repeat elements in picea glauca genes
the possible origin of long introns as observed in conifer genomes was investigated by searching for the presence of repeated sequences including transposable elements.

first, the repetitive element content of the bacs was estimated based on a repetitive library constructed with p. glauca data  as a baseline. it was 55% on average, but it varied considerably among the bac clones, ranging from 18% to 83%. additional file 4: figure s <dig> shows that around half of repetitive sequences were classified as ltr-rt elements and the other half as unknown elements .

we then analyzed the sequences of the  <dig> p. glauca genes described above including those identified in bacs, representing a total of  <dig> introns. the gene structures of these genes were screened for repeat elements using a p. glauca repeat library . we found repetitive elements in  <dig> of the genes for a total of  <dig> unclassified fragments with no significant hits in repbase;  <dig> of the fragments produced no hits in genbank and were  <dig> bp on average and only two had significant hits in nr genbank .

we also extended our analysis to include an additional set of genomic sequences obtained by targeted gene space sequencing based on sequence capture . complete genomics sequences spanning the entire known mrna sequence were recovered for  <dig> complete genes,  <dig> of which contained one or more introns. the different repetitive elements identified in introns and exons were then estimated. the proportion of genes harbouring repetitive elements in their introns was  <dig> % and was only  <dig> % in exons. the repetitive elements represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the intronic and exonic sequences, respectively . the repetitive sequences that were identified ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp  in exons and from  <dig> to  <dig> bp  in introns. the unclassified elements were the most numerous, representing on average 80% of the hits in both introns and exons . class i ltr transposons were the most abundant group of classified repetitive elements and were only represented by incomplete elements. the ltrs were accounted for the higher repetitive element sequence representation in introns; however, on average, the sequences identified as copia and gypsy elements were longer in exons than in introns.

discussion
this study reports on the detailed gene structure analysis of  <dig> genes from the conifer picea glauca obtained from bac sequencing and genome assembly. recent analyses of the picea abies and pinus taeda genomes have analyzed individual introns and reported among the highest average intron lengths, the longest introns and highest average among long introns  <cit> . we aimed to develop an understanding of the gene structure in conifers through a detailed analysis of entire genes taking into account gene expression profiles, with a particular emphasis on the potential impact of longer introns on gene structure trough comparative analyses. our findings were also derived from the analysis of nearly  <dig> gene sequences obtained from sequence capture sequencing. we present an interpretation of our findings in regard to the evolution of gene structure.

evolution of gene structure in plants
analyses over a broad phylogenetic spectrum in eukaryotes showed that increases in genome size correlate with increases in the average intron length  <cit> . a strong relationship between intron length and genome size was observed from studies in humans and pufferfish  <cit> , species of drosophilla <cit> , and from studies of plants with small genomes  <cit> .

our study compared the gene structure  of  <dig> homologous genes between four seed plant species with very different genome sizes. the conifer p. glauca has the largest genome with  <dig>  gbp  <cit> ; among angiosperms, the monocot z. mays has a genome of  <dig>  gbp  <cit> , and dicots represent smaller plant genomes in this set, i.e. p. trichocarpa with genome of  <dig> mbp  <cit>  and a. thaliana with the smallest genome of  <dig> mbp  <cit> . in the present study, the average exon length was similar between the four species, but the overall length of genes varied owing to longer introns in p. glauca, p. trichocarpa and z. mays. for the set of sequences analyzed, p. glauca had  <dig>  times more intron sequence per gene than arabidopsis,  <dig>  times more than poplar and  <dig>  times more than maize ; however, the statistical significance of these differences was variable.

the landscape of intron sizes in plants appears rather complex. a significant number of vitis vinifera introns were shown to be uncommonly large for its genome size of  <dig> mbp, compared to other plants  <cit> . in gossypium, after multiple inferred rounds of genome expansion and contraction, intron size remained unchanged  <cit> . such a pattern may be expected, given that genome size increase by polyploidy is sudden and fundamentally different than other types of genome size variation such as the gradual accumulation or loss of repeat elements over time. taken together, observations from different plants indicated that events resulting in the expansion or contraction of intergenic regions are not clearly reflected by shifts in introns length. it thus appears that the evolution of intron length and genome size may be uncoupled in plants or alternatively, that the evolution of intron length is lineage specific .

even though our study was based on  <dig> genes, our results are consistent with variations of intron size reported for a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and z. mays genomes  <cit> . we concluded that the increased intron length in p. glauca, p. trichocarpa and z. mays was heterogeneous compared to a. thaliana. even in genes with many introns, only a few introns were very long, whereas in arabidopsis, genes exhibited a more uniform intron length, suggesting that introns expansion or contraction within a gene may be independent across species.

comparisons between the a. thaliana  and a. lyrata  genomes, which diverged about  <dig> million years ago, showed that most of the difference in genome size was due to hundreds of thousands of small deletions, mostly in noncoding dna  <cit> . the authors concluded that evolution toward genome compaction is occurring in arabidopsis. conifers such as species of picea and pinus have large amounts of repetitive elements in intergenic regions and apparently more intronic sequence per gene in comparison to many angiosperms. our results do not reveal whether the p. glauca genome and introns are expanding, or alternatively evolving at slower pace, than other plant genomes which are contracting. some evidence like the presence of very ancient retrotransposon elements  <cit>  and the lack of gene rearrangements since before their split from extant angiosperms  <cit>  lend credence to the paradigm that conifer genomes are slowly evolving.

repetitive sequences in gene evolution
transposable elements play a role in plant genes as was shown by the abundance of te- gene chimeras in arabidopsis which was reported as  <dig> % of expressed genes  <cit> . the abundance of tes may be especially high in long introns as recently shown in picea abies where most of the introns were longer than  <dig> kbp, representing 5% of the total intron count  <cit> . this trend was also observed in other repeat rich genomes as v. vinifera and z. mays <cit> .

we isolated p. glauca bac clones each containing a different complete transcription unit for  <dig> target genes. in each the bacs , only one intact gene sequence was identified, which is indicative of large intergenic regions as reported for other conifers  <cit> . previous studies on conifer trees have considered only two targeted genes  isolated from p. glauca bac clones  <cit>  and only a few other intact genes with complete coding sequence isolated from bacs in pines  <cit> .

complete sequencing of the p. glauca bacs showed that the repetitive element content is not distributed uniformly in proximal intergenic regions, as indicated by the variable proportion of repetitive elements among the different bacs. a study in  <dig> p. taeda bacs, sequences similar to eukaryote repeat elements  represented 23% of the sequence on average, and ranged from 19% to 33%  <cit> . in p. glauca, 26% of bac sequences were classified as ltr-rt repetitive elements on average and ranged from 8% to 47%, while p. taeda had an average of  <dig> % of ltr-rt  <cit> . furthermore, an average 26% of the p. glauca bac sequences were unknown repeat elements. results in spruce and pine indicate a relatively low abundance of tes in gene proximal sequences compared to whole genomes at 70% in the picea abies genome  <cit>  and around 80% in pinus taeda <cit> .

picea and pinus genomes are reported to have among the highest average for the longest intron per gene, when compared to angiosperms of diverse genome sizes  <cit> . we verified whether insertions of repetitive elements could be responsible for the length of introns in p. glauca in a set of more than  <dig> genes sequences, and found that more genes harboring repetitive elements in introns were  <dig> times more frequent than genes harboring repetitive elements in exons, i.e.  <dig> % vs  <dig> %. the vast majority of the repetitive elements were short fragments, suggesting that they were remnants or fragments of te insertions that have not persisted and could represent ancient insertion events. importantly, interpretation of our findings in p. glauca must take into account the fact that the sequences were derived from a sequence capture study and that nearly all of the introns in the data set were < <dig> kbp. thus we show that te sequences are ubiquitous even in genes that do not harbor long introns, suggesting that their presence has been very widespread during the evolution of conifer genes. an analysis of intact ltr te in picea genomic sequences showed that most insertions date back to  <dig> mya or more, with a maximum around 20– <dig> mya  <cit> . the te remnants that we detected in p. glauca indicate that many genes introns contained te in a more or less distant past. in this report and in recent analyses of conifer genomes, an emphasis has been place on long introns; however the median intron length in conifers is very similar to other plant species, most of which have a median between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. therefore our findings on intron are relevant for a large majority of introns rather than a small fraction represented by large or very large introns.

slow evolution of conifer genes
analyses of the gene structure of  <dig> orthologous genes between p. glauca and p. taeda clearly showed the conservation of gene structure and the distribution of intron sizes in spite a divergence time of  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . the conservation of long introns was also observed across gymnosperm taxa, where a group of long introns in p. abies was identified as orthologous to long introns in p. sylvestris and gnetum gnemon <cit> . we suggest that the long introns observed in p. glauca likely date back to a period predating the divergence of major conifer groups. as more conifers genomes become available  <cit>  and assembly contiguities are improved it will be possible to extend this analyses of orthologous gene structures among conifers.

we also observed that the sequence of many introns was highly similar between spruce and pine, and that shorter introns were more conserved on average. between humans and chimpanzee, a strong positive correlation was found between intron length and divergence  <cit> . the pattern found in conifers as well as observations in primates lead to the hypothesis that shorter introns could be under stronger selection pressure than longer introns, which could be explained by factors such as the maintenance of functional regulatory elements in shorter introns or impacts on rna transcript processing and stability. in our analysis of sequence similarity between picea and pinus,  <dig> of the introns were longer than  <dig> kbp and only two of them had high sequence similarity. future studies with more long introns are required to confirm the hypothesis that shorter introns are more conserved in conifers. despite the fact that introns are assumed to be non-coding, conserved introns may play a functional role related to gene expression.

costs and benefits associated with intron size
there is also considerable debate about other factors that may impact the evolution of introns, aside from transposable elements. lynch  <cit>  stated that the reduced efficiency of selection in regions of low recombination may lead to an increase in intron size if small introns provide a slightly improved transcription efficiency or splicing accuracy. on the other hand, comeron and kreitman  <cit>  proposed that there might be situations in which a longer intron is selectively advantageous as an explanation for intron persistence and increased lengths. if so, there would be indirect selection for large introns in regions of low recombination because they can reduce the load caused by deleterious mutations by increasing the recombination rate. it was proposed that conifers have low recombination rates at both the genome and within-gene scales  <cit> . their low recombination rates may explain at least in part, the accumulation of longer introns.

the high degree of sequence conservation that we observed in short introns between spruce and pine may also depend on the recombination rate within genes, where small introns would be under stronger selection because of efficiency in transcription and splicing, and long introns in regions of low recombination diverge because of reduced selection pressure. another factor underlying the evolution of intron size is that intron length would be constrained by energy use during transcription, given that large introns represent a higher cost of transcription, the so-called “economy” or low-cost transcription hypothesis  <cit> . in the present study, the  <dig> p. glauca genes analyzed were divided in two groups based on their expression profiles, i.e.  <dig> genes associated with secondary cell-wall formation or nitrogen metabolism, many of which had tissue preferential expression, and  <dig> genes that were highly transcribed in a large range of tissues . the highly expressed genes had more intronic sequences per gene on average than the more specialized subset of genes . we also observed a large variation among genes in each group, i.e. from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in highly transcribed genes and  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in the set of more specialized genes. these observations do not support the “economy” hypothesis in p. glauca as there appears to be no clear rule governing the relationship between intron size and expression levels or profiles. in humans, genes contained total intronic sequences are ~ <dig>  bp per gene on average  <cit> , which more than any plant described so far. it was observed that intron length declines steadily as the expression level increases in humans, in agreement with the low-cost transcription hypothesis  <cit> . considering the smaller amount of intron sequences in plant genes including conifers compared to humans, it may be that the economy rule does not impact their introns as strongly as in vertebrates and that other evolutionary forces are main drivers of intron size evolution. this interpretation is consistent with the findings reported for the p. abies genome  <cit> . future studies with more genes are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that p. glauca has longer introns than arabidopsis, p. trichocarpa and z. mays on average due the presence of few long introns. intron size and the position of long introns within genes were variable between plant lineages but well conserved in conifers. our findings are consistent with recent reports indicating that conifers accumulate very long introns but we point out that long introns represent a relatively small fraction of the overall intronic content, which is reflected by the median length of similar size to other plants. we show that re sequences are detected at a high frequency  even in introns < <dig> kbp, indicating their ubiquitous presence in conifer genes over the course of evolution.

taken together, our observations and the recent literature suggest that the evolution of plant gene structure is determined by more interacting forces than classically expected. the pattern is reminiscent of the heterogeneity of rates of evolution at the genetic, genomic and morphological levels seen among seed plants including angiosperms, conifers, annual and perennial taxa. it stands to reason that the distinctive features of the conifer genome, such as its large size and relatively small occupancy of the gene space, its conserved macro-structure, the large numbers of repetitive elements, and long introns, represent the product of the intricate evolutionary history of conifers.
