BACKGROUND
the cow´s ability to reproduce is essential for milk production. impaired reproduction will result in additional inseminations, higher replacement rate and increased culling rate. recently genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis approaches have advanced tremendously. the availability of full genome sequence data can help to identify causal mutations underlying variation in female fertility. application of these tools has led to remarkable increases in the numbers of trait markers available and thus enhanced precision of qtl mapping.

genome-wide association studies  examine common genetic variants in large numbers of individuals to determine whether an association with quantitative traits exists. gwas have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  across the cattle genome associated with economically important traits in cattle . however, most of the genetic variants detected by these studies are not causal for the traits themselves. instead they are in linkage disequilibrium  with the causal polymorphisms. most gwas studies in cattle have used data from one breed only. in most cases this has been the holstein friesian  where the largest datasets are available. the low effective population size in hf has resulted in long-range ld
 <cit> . this limits the studies’ ability to distinguish between causal factors and markers in strong ld with causal factors. the limitation can sometimes be overcome by using data from multiple breeds. a second limitation of previous mapping studies is that the marker panels used only represent a small fraction of the variants segregating in the population. using a panel of individuals with whole genome sequence, in principle all snps can be imputed for all individuals in the mapping population
 <cit> . the data thereby comes to include the causal variants. causal effects thereby become identifiable.

in addition to revealing the genetic architecture that underlies the physiological and biological process of female reproduction, this information could also be practically applied to genomic selection schemes. genomic prediction helps to select breeding animals for the next generation more efficiently. introducing high density snp arrays  did not substantial increase accuracy of genomic predictions in cattle  as compared to medium density 50 k snp arrays
 <cit> . one of the reasons discussed was the increase in the number of unknown parameters to be estimated with high density data. with the availability of full genome sequence data this problem increases many folds. however, if the causal mutations underlying female fertility are identified and not only markers in ld with the causal mutation, the information could be included in genomic prediction models where additional weight can be put on certain genomic regions/variants which influence female fertility. this would in particular improve predictions over generations and across breeds.

previously qtl areas influencing female fertility traits have been identified in the nordic holstein cattle population using the 50 k snp array
 <cit> . in this study two of these qtl regions previously identified
 <cit>   were first analyzed using the hd 777 k snp array to further refine the regions in the nh. in addition, the danish jersey  and nordic red  breeds were screened with the bovine hd array to investigate if the qtl on bta <dig> and bta <dig> were segregating in these breeds as well. to further refine the qtl regions in the nh, these regions were re-analyzed with the imputed full sequence data.

RESULTS
hd snp analysis
bta <dig> and bta <dig> were screened with the bovine hd snp array in the nh, nr and dj breeds, based on the positions on the genome which were chosen due to high significance from höglund et al.
 <cit> . bta <dig> was screened for nrrh, iflh, nrrc, icf, iflc, aish, aisc in a  <dig> ,026 bp region spanning positions  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,784 bp , whereas bta <dig> was screened for icf only, in the region ranging from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,079 bp . icf was the only trait which showed significance in this position on bta <dig> in the previous study
 <cit> . correlations of the minor allele frequencies of the most significant markers in the nh, dj and nr pointed in the direction that the qtl for icf is breed specific on bta <dig>  however the results of correlations between the minor allele frequencies of the most significant marker in the three breeds on bta <dig> were inconclusive whether the qtls were breed specific. snp markers in the nh breed reached significance levels on both bta <dig> and bta <dig> . however, no markers in the dj and nr breeds reached significance analyzing hd snp data.figure  <dig>

based on the results using the hd array  an area from  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,784 bp was selected for further analysis with full sequence data for this region. based on the sequence data analysis  the qtl position was narrowed down to two regions. region  <dig> spanned positions between  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,957 bp  and region  <dig> spanned  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,784 bp . the two regions were searched for candidate genes/polymorphisms . in total  <dig> genes were identified in these regions of which  <dig> were annotated, three were described as uncharacterized proteins and one was not annotated . the annotated markers showing association with aisc, iflc, nrrc and icf are shown in table

based on the results of the hd array  an area from  <dig> ,457 bp to  <dig> ,006 bp was analyzed using sequence data . the highest –log <dig> was  <dig>  at  <dig> ,159 bp. based on the analysis using sequence data two regions were identified : region 1:  <dig> ,143- <dig> ,994 bp  and region 2:  <dig> ,815- <dig> ,728 bp . linkage disequilibrium  analysis showed that these two regions are in almost complete ld . bta <dig> was screened for candidate genes/polymorphisms in the range of 33 mb to  <dig>  mb. in total  <dig> genes were identified in the area from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb in of which  <dig> were annotated, one was described as uncharacterized protein and one was described as a pseudogene . these genes were not located in region  <dig> and region  <dig> . the snps in region  <dig> and region  <dig> as well as the region in-between were annotated by variant effect predictor as “intergenic” i.e. no candidate genes were identified.figure  <dig>

discussion
by analyzing the results of the significant qtl presented earlier
 <cit>  using the hd data, it became evident that bta <dig> and bta <dig> showed the most significant results.

in this study we have re-analyzed two regions which were previously associated to female fertility traits and validated in different breeds of dairy cattle
 <cit> . a single marker analysis was performed using the hd array and subsequently dna sequence for bta <dig> and bta <dig>  respectively. the physical location of the snps has been used to search for candidate genes on the bovine genome.

bta04
in the qtl region  <dig> genes were annotated . based on the –log <dig> , cd <dig> is the most obvious candidate gene. cd <dig> has a missense variant. a missense variant is a sequence variant that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved . cd <dig> has been suggested to be involved in numerous potential physiological functions; cell adhesion processes, binds long chain fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty acid transport and act as receptor for thombospondins, thbs <dig> and thbs <dig>  mediating their antiangiogenic effects. this in turn involves many physiological processes
 <cit> .

another interesting candidate on bta <dig> based on its suggested biological function is semaphorin-3c . sema3c binds to members of the plexin family and plays an important role in the regulation of developmental processes. furthermore it is required for normal cardiovascular development during embryogenesis and plays an important role in axon growth and axon guidance by functioning as attractant for growing axons . however, the snp markers located in these genes did not reach genome wide significance for the traits aisc, iflc, and nrrc . at this stage annotation of this region on bta <dig> is not sufficient to reach a firm conclusion about the causal polymorphism. even though some of the snp markers were located within genes, the snp markers with the most significant associations to aisc and iflc were not annotated. therefore, a better annotation might help to identify the nature of the causal mutation.

bta13
the hd analysis revealed a sharp peak on bta <dig> in the range of  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. searching the chromosome for genes revealed a low number of annotated genes . eight of these genes were in the  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb range. the sequence analysis revealed two regions within the  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb range. even though we have used sequence data it is still a challenge to disentangle whether the peaks harbor the same genetic variation influencing icf, or are in reality a combination of two separate genetic variations. therefor the two peaks were analyzed further and were determined to be in high ld. this suggests that it is the same genetic variation causing the two peaks. the snps annotated in these two regions were all annotated as intergenic variants. it is possible that bta <dig> at this stage is poorly annotated such that the associated polymorphisms are located in as-yet undiscovered genes.

fertility traits are complex traits as many different biological and physiological factors determine whether a cow is fertile, another challenge is the way the phenotypes are defined, they do not distinguish between different biological functions as they are defined more for a breeding purpose than from a biological point of view. therefore it is not expected that there is a simple explanation with an obvious candidate gene, it is more likely a network of genes and intragenic variants that explain the variation of these traits. a number of genes and their potential functions in the vicinity of the two peaks are presented in table 
 <dig> 

selection of markers
the two regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig> were chosen based on previous studies by the authors
 <cit> . the snp markers for bta <dig> and bta <dig> from the bovine hd array have been tested in the three breeds. even though the number of sires in the nr and dj breeds are much lower compared to the nh breed the results suggest that the qtl for female fertility traits detected on both chromosomes are specific for the nh breed. what appeared to be the same hits on several chromosomes in a previous manuscript in several breeds when using the 50 k snp array, clearly was not when using the 700 k snp array.

we have been able to narrow down the regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig> by adding many more markers. however in our analysis we could not with certainty pinpoint the causal polymorphism for the fertility qtl. this might be due to the fact that half of the total genetic variants identified in the whole genome sequencing  were filtered out for various reasons. all the variants which were not bi-allelic were dropped due to limitations in the imputation software. therefore, the actual causative polymorphism may be missing from the data analyzed here. furthermore, there were hundreds of snps with very high –log <dig> due to high ld among themselves. therefore, it is not possible to pick a few from them based on this analysis.

effect of recessive lethals on fertility in dairy cattle
recently it has been argued that an increase in recessive lethals play a part in the decline of fertility as elite sires obtain a very large number of offspring in cattle breeding, and the effective population size is around  <dig> in the holstein breed
 <cit> . the development of increased information on the cattle genome has enabled us to detect putative recessive lethal mutations by the absence  of homozygous recessive individuals in the population
 <cit> . some recessive lethal alleles are known to affect the developing embryo. a recent study in the nordic holstein population
 <cit>  has identified a number of recessive lethal haplotypes which appear to act in early pregnancy. the carrier frequency of the recessive lethal alleles is up to 20% in the nordic holstein population. also, vanraden et al.
 <cit>  and fritz et al.
 <cit>  have mapped recessive lethals genes by homozygosity mapping in holstein populations. however in the present study it does not seem to be the same effects that are picked up as the recessive lethals are not located on bta <dig> or bta <dig> 

annotation of the bovine genome
tools and resources for annotation and gene discovery in the bovine genome are available . even though many genes have already been annotated on the bovine genome , the known set sites of gene transcription, initiation, termination as well as differential splicing remains incomplete. therefore, information on genomic structure of organisms which are better annotated like mouse and human, are used as an information source to cover these gaps in the knowledge of the genome structure. however, identifying regulatory elements and non-protein coding regions annotation remains more challenging
 <cit> .

regulatory elements in the genome
it is a challenge to identify all regulatory elements in the genome also those which control gene expression. the question is how to relate genes and their products function. even though we have access to the cattle sequence which facilitates the comprehensive identification of these transcriptional regulatory factors there is still a long way to go. the expressions of eukaryotic protein coding genes are regulated in different steps which include elements like; transcription initiation and elongation, mrna processing, transport, translation and stability. most regulation is believed to occur at the level of transcription
 <cit> .

directly measured phenotypes and genotypes of cows are necessary to provide a more direct link between phenotype and genotype, it can also enable mapping of non-additive effects which affect fertility traits in cattle
 <cit> . this was not investigated in the present study but could potentially shed more information regarding fertility in cattle.

identification and analysis of phenotypic measures that reflect more directly the physiologic background of the reproduction traits could also be helpful in determining the precise physiological background represented by a specific qtl. analyzing expression data from reproductive organs might help to identify the temporal-specific aspects of gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from screening bta <dig> and bta <dig> of nh, nr and dj using the bovine hd snp array for female fertility traits suggested that the qtl for female fertility located on these chromosomes were specific for the nh breed. the subsequent screening using the imputed sequence variants for nh narrowed down the qtl on bta <dig> into two regions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  mb respectively, while on bta <dig> the qtl region for icf was narrowed down into two regions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. a candidate gene search for these qtl regions revealed that a missense mutation in the platelet glycoprotein  <dig>  gene showed the strongest association with fertility traits and therefore is a strong candidate for the qtl on bta <dig>  whereas the annotated snps on bta <dig> were all intergenic variants. fertility traits are complex traits as many different biological and physiological factors determine whether a cow is fertile. therefore it is not expected that there is a simple explanation with an obvious candidate gene but it is more likely a network of genes and intragenic variants that explain the variation of these traits.
