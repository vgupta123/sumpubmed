BACKGROUND
conventional fruit juice processing involves a heating step to inactivate the vegetative forms of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. any remaining bacterial spores are generally unable to germinate due to the acidic nature of the juices  <cit> . this ensures acceptable safety margins and extends the shelf-life of the juice. however, heat treatment causes vitamin losses and changes in flavour of the juices and some consumers regard heat-treated, shelf-stable products as low in quality. in the last  <dig> years, there have been several outbreaks of food poisoning associated with drinking un-pasteurised apple juice contaminated with enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h <dig> and several children have died in the usa  <cit> . warning labels are now required in the usa for all fruit juices unless a 5-log pathogen reduction treatment has been applied to the product  <cit> . therefore, there is a need for new methods of fruit juice preservation that rely less heavily on severe heat treatment or the addition of synthetic preservatives. it has been suggested that many natural antimicrobial compounds from plant, animal and microbial sources might fulfil this need  <cit> .

carvacrol -phenol) is a major component of the essential oils of oregano and thyme  <cit> . generally recognized as a safe food additive, carvacrol is used as a flavouring agent in baked goods, sweets, beverages and chewing gum  <cit> . carvacrol-containing essential oils are biostatic and/or biocidal against many bacteria, yeast and fungi in laboratory media and consequently have attracted considerable research attention as potential food preservatives . carvacrol has also been shown to inactivate microorganisms in biofilms on stainless steel surfaces  <cit> . the biocidal mode of action of carvacrol on bacteria is similar to that of other phenolic compounds and occurs via membrane damage resulting in an increase in membrane permeability to protons and potassium ions, depletion of the intracellular atp pool and disruption of the proton-motive force  <cit> .

the biological precursor of carvacrol, p-cymene -benzene), is less antimicrobial than carvacrol when used alone. p-cymene lacks a hydroxyl group, which is thought to play an important role in antimicrobial activity  <cit> . synergism between carvacrol and p-cymene against b. cereus in vitro and in rice has been reported  <cit> .

the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of carvacrol, thymol, cinnamic acid and other phenolic compounds from herbs and spices against some food-borne bacteria in vitro have been reported at around  <dig> mm  <cit> . however, a much higher concentration is usually needed to achieve the same biocidal or biostatic effects in foods. for example, the mic of carvacrol in mushroom soup inoculated with b. cereus was  <dig> times higher than that found in laboratory media  <cit> . similarly, the concentrations of carvacrol and cinnamic acid required to delay spoilage of mango, kiwifruit and melon slices was > <dig> mm  <cit> . a number of intrinsic  and extrinsic  factors are thought to play a role in protecting microorganisms from the biocidal effects of carvacrol in foods. furthermore, the potent aromatic and antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds at these high concentrations have been reported to lead to undesirable colour, odour and flavour changes in food products  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of very low concentrations of carvacrol and p-cymene both individually and in combination as a novel means of controlling escherichia coli o157:h <dig> in un-pasteurised apple juice.

RESULTS
inactivation/inhibition of microorganisms with  <dig>  mm carvacrol and p-cymene used individually
at 25°c, the total viable counts in un-pasteurized, untreated apple juice increased in the first  <dig> days to a level of  <dig> log cfu/ml, where they remained up to day  <dig> . yeast counts reflected the total counts. when inoculated into raw apple juice, e. coli o157:h <dig> survived for up to  <dig> days at 25°c but by day  <dig>  numbers decreased to below the detection limit of the plate-counting method . enrichment methods allowed the detection of e coli up to  <dig> days after inoculation at 25°c but by day  <dig>  none were detected .

in the presence of  <dig>  mm carvacrol, there was an initial reduction  in total and yeast counts of about  <dig> log cfu/ml . this was followed by re-growth of total viable numbers to about  <dig> log cfu/ml within  <dig> days where they remained steady until day  <dig>  yeast numbers continued to fall in the presence of  <dig>  mm carvacrol and by day  <dig> reached levels below the detection limit of the assay . in the presence of  <dig>  mm p-cymene, total plate counts increased more slowly than in the untreated controls but by day  <dig>  numbers were similar to those in the controls. yeasts were initially inactivated by p-cymene and remained at low levels  from day  <dig> to  <dig> but then increased to about 6– <dig> log cfu/ml by day  <dig> where they remained up to day  <dig>  notably, numbers of e. coli decreased to below the limit of detection of the plate-counting method within less than one day of exposure to both carvacrol and p-cymene. e. coli were no longer detectable by enrichment methods after  <dig> days in the presence of carvacrol and after  <dig> days in the presence of p-cymene .

at 4°c, total viable numbers and yeasts in the untreated juice remained at about 4– <dig> log cfu/ml for the first  <dig> days of incubation, followed by very slow growth to about  <dig> log cfu/ml by day  <dig> . in the presence of  <dig>  mm carvacrol and p-cymene, there was a gradual decline in total and yeast numbers with carvacrol affecting a slightly steeper reduction in total viable numbers than p-cymene. by day  <dig>  total numbers were about  <dig> and  <dig> log cfu/ml in the presence of  <dig>  mm carvacrol and p-cymene, respectively. notably, e. coli o157:h <dig> survived at a level of 3– <dig> log cfu/ml for up to  <dig> days at 4°c, was still countable on day  <dig>  and was detectable  on day  <dig> of incubation. in contrast, e coli was not countable  or detectable  after  <dig> day of exposure to either carvacrol or p-cymene . the results for e. coli shown in figure  <dig> were obtained using thin tsa overlaid on selective ct-smac agar  in an attempt to resuscitate injured organisms. the results obtained on plain ct-smac agar and on chromagar  were very similar and are consequently not illustrated.

it was noted that the addition of either carvacrol or cymene at  <dig>  mm imparted an intense "spicy" aroma to the treated apple juices.

inactivation of microorganisms with  <dig>  mm carvacrol and/or  <dig>  mm p-cymene at 4°c
since the results above indicated that survival of e. coli o157:h <dig> was substantially extended at chill temperatures and therefore represented a greater cause for concern than survival at ambient temperatures, further work was undertaken at 4°c only. in order to study the effect of combinations of carvacrol and cymene, both compounds were used at concentrations that had no or very little inhibitory effect on microorganisms. as shown in figure  <dig>  addition of  <dig>  mm carvacrol or  <dig>  mm p-cymene individually to apple juice had a very slight inhibitory effect on total microbial counts at 4°c. like in figure  <dig>  survival of e. coli o157:h <dig> persisted for two weeks at this temperature . using the plate-counting technique, it is shown in figure  <dig> that survival of e. coli was curtailed by both  <dig>  mm carvacrol and  <dig>  mm p-cymene to about  <dig> days. enrichment techniques showed that e. coli was detectable up to  <dig> and  <dig> days in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm carvacrol and p-cymene, respectively. however, when the two compounds were added to the juice together, e. coli could not be counted or detected after  <dig> day of exposure to the treatment . plating out on selective agars with or without a thin layer of tsa gave very similar results to those shown in figure  <dig> and so these counts are not illustrated.

it was noted that the addition of  <dig>  mm carvacrol and  <dig>  mm p-cymene, alone or in combination, imparted a very slight "spicy" aroma to the treated juices.

throughout this study, the ph of the juices remained essentially unchanged at around  <dig>  ±  <dig> , irrespective of the type of treatment or storage temperature.

discussion
freshly-pressed apple juice prepared from healthy fruit can be expected to contain around 3– <dig> log cfu/ml of viable microorganisms, of which the majority are yeasts  <cit> . the results in this study were consistent with this expectation, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the ph of the juices used in this study was at the lower end  of the expected ph range  for fresh apple juice  <cit> .

despite the low ph, e. coli o157:h <dig> survived in raw apple juice for  <dig> days at 25°c and nearly  <dig> weeks  at 4°c. these findings agree with those reported elsewhere  <cit> . the acidic nature of apple juice does not ensure its safety as e. coli o157:h <dig> may survive for extended periods of time, especially at chill temperatures.

the antimicrobial properties of carvacrol and similar phenolic compounds from the essential oils of herbs and spices have been reported previously against individual microorganisms, tested in vitro  <cit> . the application of carvacrol in the preservation of some foods such as rice and fresh-cut fruit has also been reported  <cit> . however, this is the first report of the successful application of relatively low doses  of carvacrol and p-cymene against e. coli o157:h <dig> in the presence of the mixed microflora of fruit juice. the results demonstrate that the addition of  <dig>  mm carvacrol or p-cymene to apple juice inactivated e. coli o157:h <dig> within less than  <dig> day from about  <dig> log cfu/ml to levels that were undetectable using conventional microbiological techniques . furthermore, once inactivated, e. coli remained undetectable for the duration of the trial . in addition, the results obtained using the thin agar layer method for resuscitating injured organisms were no different from those using selective media alone, suggesting that the cellular injury caused by the phenolic compounds was irreversible. the substantial reduction in the number of days  that e. coli o157:h <dig> was able to survive in apple juice when treated with  <dig>  mm carvacrol or p-cymene and stored at chill temperatures represents an opportunity to improve the safety of un-pasteurised fruit juices.

in addition to their antibacterial activity, carvacrol and p-cymene were also biocidal against the yeast flora naturally present in the apple juice . however,  <dig>  mm p-cymene was not as effective as the same concentration of carvacrol in eliminating the yeast population at ambient temperature. those yeasts surviving the treatment with p-cymene recovered and eventually reached the same viable numbers as in the untreated control. by contrast, the presence of either phenolic compound at  <dig>  mm resulted in similar, gradual die-off of the yeast population at chill temperatures. the results confirm the broad antimicrobial spectrum of carvacrol but also suggest that yeasts may be somewhat less sensitive to phenolic compounds than bacteria. the reduction in numbers of spoilage yeasts would clearly benefit both the manufacturer and consumer by extending the shelf-life of the product.

when carvacrol and p-cymene were added to apple juice at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively, e. coli o157:h <dig> and the yeast population were reduced but to a different extent than was observed at the higher concentrations of  <dig>  mm. the shapes of the inactivation curves for the total viable numbers  would suggest that there may have been some synergism between carvacrol and p-cymene but the results for e. coli  suggest that the effect may have been additive. in the presence of  <dig>  mm carvacrol and  <dig>  mm p-cymene used alone, e. coli was not detectable for  <dig> and  <dig> d longer than in the control but in the presence of both compounds used in combination, the organism was not detectable for  <dig> d longer. therefore, it is not possible to conclude unequivocally whether the effect of adding the two substances was synergistic or merely additive.

it has been reported previously that carvacrol was more effective in reducing the viable count of the natural microflora on kiwifruit  than on honeydew melon   <cit> . at low ph, the hydrophobicity of essential oil components increases, enabling them to partition more easily into the lipids of the cell membrane of bacteria.

it is known that direct plating on selective media following exposure to physical or chemical stresses can lead to gross underestimation of viable counts by as much as 3– <dig> log cfu ml- <dig>  <cit> . although a thin agar layer method  <cit>  and enrichment techniques  <cit>  were used in this study to allow some resuscitation of the inoculated pathogen, it is possible that the results shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> represent an underestimate of numbers. furthermore, it is possible that a larger sample volume  in the pre-enrichment step would have allowed the resuscitation and recovery of an even greater number of e. coli from the control juices.

in the present study, ethanol was used as a solvent for the preparation of stock solutions of carvacrol and cymene. whilst the final concentrations of ethanol in the juices were below the tolerance limit previously reported for e. coli  <cit> , it is possible that the low levels of ethanol present  may have potentiated the biocidal action of the phenolic compounds. this possibility would need experimental confirmation in future work.

CONCLUSIONS
when inoculated into un-pasteurised apple juice, e. coli o157:h <dig> survived for up to  <dig> and  <dig> days at 4° and 25°c, respectively. at  <dig>  mm and at both storage temperatures, carvacrol and p-cymene reduced the numbers of e. coli o157:h <dig> to undetectable levels within 1– <dig> days. the effective concentrations of carvacrol could be reduced even further by combining it at  <dig>  mm with p-cymene at  <dig>  mm. carvacrol and p-cymene were biocidal against both spoilage yeasts and e. coli o157:h <dig> thereby increasing the shelf-life and improving the safety of un-pasteurised apple juice, particularly when stored at chill temperatures.
