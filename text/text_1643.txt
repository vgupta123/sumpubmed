BACKGROUND
recent advances in sequencing technologies and de novo genome assembly algorithms have greatly reduced the time, cost, and difficulty of generating novel genomes
 <cit> . this has led to organized efforts to sequence a representative species from all major vertebrate taxa, referred to as the genome 10k project
 <cit> , as well as a similar project to sequence five thousand insect genomes, the i5k project
 <cit> . while these efforts have the potential to transform comparative studies, many applications including studies of biological function will be limited without quality genome annotations. genome annotations of newly sequenced species initially rely primarily on ab initio gene predictions and alignment of reference transcripts of related species; however, the quality of gene models is greatly improved when incorporating same species transcriptomic sequencing
 <cit> . in particular, information from high-density next-generation rna sequencing, i.e., deep transcriptomes, greatly improves even well-annotated genomes
 <cit> .

while  <dig> mammalian genomes and  <dig> avian genomes have been published
 <cit> , whole genome sequences have only recently been available for non-avian reptiles. the first published non-avian reptilian genome was that of a squamate, the lizard anolis carolinensis 
 <cit> . subsequently, releases of draft genomes from another squamate, the burmese python, python molurus bivittatus,
 <cit>  and three crocodilian species: the american alligator, alligator mississippiensis, the gharial gavialis gangeticus, and the saltwater crocodile crocodylus porosus <cit>  were published. as an emerging model system with its genome sequence available, the green anole has already proved useful in a variety of fields including comparative genomics
 <cit> , functional genomics
 <cit> , behavior
 <cit> , evolutionary genetics
 <cit> , and development and evolution
 <cit> . in all of these areas of research, the green anole genome, in combination with avian and mammalian data, provides a key perspective on conserved and divergent features among amniotes.

currently, the public databases of the national center for biotechnology information , ensembl, and university of california, santa cruz  have devoted anole genome portals. ncbi and ensembl provide first generation genome annotations, which are based primarily on conservation with other species
 <cit> . these first generation annotations rely heavily on conservation of protein-coding sequences, and as such, predicted green anole genes generally lack untranslated regions  and often do not contain start and/or stop codons. furthermore, alternative splice forms and evolutionarily divergent orthologues are not represented in the first generation annotations. these issues have limited the ability of researchers to carry out comparative and functional genomic studies based on the a. carolinensis genome sequence.

in order to help resolve many of these issues, here we present a second generation revised annotation based on a foundation of  <dig> de novo deep transcriptomes and published cdna sequences. we used a customized pipeline based on the program to assemble spliced alignments 
 <cit> , evidencemodeler 
 <cit>  and maker2
 <cit>  to combine the following data: i) de novo and reference based assemblies of  <dig> rna-seq transcriptomes, ii)  <dig> publicly available est libraries, iii) refseq alignments of the available vertebrate transcripts, iv) refseq alignments of zebrafish, xenopus frog, chicken, mouse, and human protein sequences, v) ncbi and ensembl current annotations, and vi) ab initio gene predictions based on analysis by snap and augustus
 <cit> .

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome generation and assembly
we carried out rna-seq to generate  <dig> adult tissue and  <dig> embryonic transcriptomes . strand-specific directional sequences were generated from adrenal gland, brain, dewlap skin, heart, liver, lung, ovary, and skeletal muscle. rna-seq generated by directional library construction can be used to distinguish between coding transcripts and antisense noncoding transcripts. the adrenal, lung, liver and skeletal muscle samples were derived from a single male individual . the brain, dewlap skin, heart, and ovary samples were pooled from several individuals . standard non-directional rna-seq libraries were prepared from regenerating tail and embryonic tissues. lizards including the green anole can regenerate their tail following autotomy, or self-amputation
 <cit> . regenerating tissues from  <dig> tails at  <dig> days post-autotomy were divided into pools of the regenerating epithelial tip and the adjacent tail base. rna-seq was also performed on the original autotomized tail from those same animals. embryos between zero to one day after egg laying  were analyzed individually by standard rna-seq as well as pooled for directional library construction and sequencing. more than  <dig> million paired-end reads were generated from these adult and embryonic tissue samples .

the pipeline for de novo assembly of rna-seq data involved two steps. first, strand-specific transcriptome sequence libraries were assembled using trinity 
 <cit> . standard non-directional rna-seq libraries were assembled using abyss and trans-abyss
 <cit> . in total, this generated more than  <dig>  million de novo assembled transcript contigs. second, these assembled contigs were aligned to the a. carolinensis anocar <dig>  assembly
 <cit>  using the gmap tool within pasa, with the aim of i) eliminating sequences not aligning to the genome and ii) merging de novo assembled sequences to remove redundancy. we observed that over 94% of these sequences aligned to the green anole genome at a cutoff of 95% identity and 90% transcript coverage. this first step of the de novo assembly pipeline reduced the number of rna-seq based transcript contigs down to  <dig> .
 <cit> . refseq, alignments of zebrafish, xenopus frog, chicken, mouse, and human protein and available vertebrate transcripts to the anocar <dig>  genome assembly. ncbi/ensembl, combined data of a. carolinensis genome annotations from ncbi ref_anocar <dig>  and ensembl build  <dig>  rna-seq, transcriptomic data from analysis of  <dig> adult and embryonic tissues.

as part of the a. carolinensis genome sequencing effort, est sequences were generated from five adult organs , embryo, and a seventh mixed organ library that included heart, kidney, liver, lung, and tongue
 <cit> . these est sequences were introduced at the second step of this pipeline and aligned to the a. carolinensis anocar <dig>  assembly using gmap, identifying another  <dig>  transcript contigs not present from the rna-seq deep transcriptomic data. this yielded a total of  <dig>  transcript contigs that were then used as the basis of the second generation a. carolinensis genome annotation .

generating a revised annotation of the a. carolinensis genome
the reannotation of the a. carolinensis genome incorporates four classes of evidence that were combined using the evm tool 
 <cit> . first, the  <dig>  de novo assembled transcript contigs were given the highest weight to generate the revised annotation. second, two ab initio gene prediction tools, snap and augustus
 <cit> , were trained using a subset of the pasa transcriptome assemblies after removing redundancy using cd-hit
 <cit> . in brief,  <dig>  a. carolinensis coding sequences were used to train snap, and  <dig>  complete predicted protein sequences were used to train augustus. third, the first generation a. carolinensis gene annotations from ncbi ref_anocar <dig>   and ensembl build  <dig>  were used as an input to evm. finally, regions of alignment to refseq homologous transcript sequences from the ucsc genome bioinformatics portal were also incorporated into the evm predictions.

since evm currently generates only a single protein-coding sequence for each gene and the transcript evidence requires at least 90% alignment to the genome, further steps were necessary to improve the annotation. first, the rna-seq reads were aligned to the anocar <dig>  assembly using tophat and reference guided assemblies were completed using cufflinks. second, the evm predictions, the cufflinks assemblies, as well as zebrafish, xenopus frog, chicken, mouse, and human protein alignments, were used as input into maker <dig> to annotate novel genes, extend utr sequence, and annotate alternative splicing . these models were updated to further incorporate utr sequences and alternate splice forms present in the de novo assembled transcripts described above. we have named this second generation annotation for a. carolinensis asu_acar version  <dig>  .

sources for genome reannotation
the improvements in the asu annotation derive from multiple sources. the largest group of annotated genes, 69% or  <dig> , were based on all sources of data, and an additional 30%  were based on two or three sources of data . in addition, rna-seq was a key source of data for this reannotation, contributing to 95% of all gene predictions. only 1% of predicted genes were based solely on one source of data . the ab initio gene predictions, which do not make use of any empirically derived data, contribute less than 1%  of the gene predictions for this reannotation. since both the first and second generation annotation pipelines rely on open reading frame and coding sequence predictions, noncoding transcripts are likely underrepresented. the generation of long noncoding and microrna-seq data and sampling of more tissues by the research community will contribute to improved a. carolinensis genome annotations in the future.

improvements in gene annotation
to quantify the differences between the first and second generation genome annotations, we compared asu with the ncbi and ensembl annotations. first, the asu annotation has identified more genes than either ncbi or ensembl . second, the asu annotation greatly increases the number of annotated transcript isoforms . third, predicted transcripts in the asu annotation appear to be more complete in a number of different parameters. of the  <dig>  annotated transcript isoforms, 90%  are predicted to be complete protein-coding sequences. furthermore, 59%  are predicted to contain 3’ utr sequences, and 79%  to contain 5’ utr sequences . in addition, the asu annotation greatly improves transcript lengths . an example of the improvements in gene annotation is evident the notch pathway ligand, delta-like  <dig> 
 <cit> .

assignment of gene orthology
identification of orthologous relationships between genes in a. carolinensis and other vertebrate model systems is a key step in comparative studies. however, this is a complex task due to gene deletions and genome duplications and rearrangements during vertebrate evolution. for protein-coding genes, metrics have been proposed
 <cit>  that consider both protein sequence similarity and synteny conservation. for comparison of asu annotation, we have used the current orthology assignments in the ncbi and ensembl gene models. given the longer transcript lengths in the asu annotation we identified that  <dig>  genes overlapped with ensembl predicted genes and  <dig>  overlapped with ncbi predicted genes .

however, this comparison left  <dig>  asu predicted genes with no orthology assignment based on ncbi or ensembl annotations. gene orthology for these remaining predicted genes were next evaluated by blast2go against the vertebrate refseq database
 <cit> . this analysis demonstrated that 56% of these predicted genes  had a blast2go expect  value score of at least 10- <dig> with a vertebrate gene, which is suggestive of a potential orthologue . of these predicted genes, 90%  contain multiple exons with an average of  <dig>  exons/gene and a n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp. these may reflect genes that have been newly identified in the asu annotation but were missing in the ncbi and ensembl annotations. the remaining 10% of the predicted genes  contain only a single annotated exon, which could result from gaps in the anocar <dig>  reference genome assembly. the remaining group of genes  aligned to the anocar <dig>  assembly but had poor vertebrate homology. this group may include novel lizard genes and rapidly diverging genes such as noncoding rnas.

transcripts with vertebrate homology not present in the anocar <dig>  genome assembly
given a  <dig> x genome coverage for the a. carolinensis anocar <dig>  assembly, only 81% of the  <dig>  gbp genome is predicted to be included in the current contig sequences
 <cit> . in addition, approximately 30% of the a. carolinensis genome consists of repetitive mobile element sequences, which leads to a lower than typical n <dig> given the sequencing depth. thus, some transcripts identified by rna-seq analysis would not align to the anocar <dig>  assembly, and these transcripts would not included in the asu annotation. this category of genes missing from the anocar <dig>  assembly may include important developmental or regulatory genes.

we developed a pipeline to analyze the genes poorly represented in the anocar <dig>  assembly . starting with  <dig>  de novo assembled contigs, the pipeline reduced this group down to  <dig>  and increased the n <dig> value from  <dig> bp up to  <dig>  bp. next, these  <dig>  contigs were analyzed by blast2go to identify homology to vertebrate refseq entries with an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> . the majority of these contigs  could be matched to  <dig>  distinct vertebrate orthologues .

analyzing these matching contigs further, we were able to identify matches with 30% of the contigs  against the  <dig>  a. carolinensis refseq proteins. this suggests that these transcript contigs that matched a. carolinensis refseq proteins but failed to align to the anocar <dig>  assembly contain genes that are partially represented on the genome or are interrupted by large gaps in the scaffolds. the remaining 70%  of these contigs mapped with highest scores to other vertebrate species . this is likely due to the incomplete state of the a. carolinensis refseq libraries. genes missing from a. carolinensis annotations can be attributed to gaps in the anocar <dig>  assembly; misassembly in genome scaffolds would interrupt contiguous alignments of transcripts at contig sequence boundaries. given these observations, additional sequencing to increase coverage of the a. carolinensis genome would improve future annotations.

high quality genome annotation requires both whole genome and transcriptome sequencing
next-gen sequencing technologies are accelerating the rate at which whole genome assemblies are being completed. among the non-avian reptiles, genomes drafts have been reported for the snake p. m. bivittatus,
 <cit> , and the crocodilian reptiles a. mississippiensis, g. gangeticus, and c. porosus <cit> . however, the reannotation of the a. carolinensis genome has highlighted the relevance of collecting deep transcriptome data from a diverse array of tissues. for evolutionary genetic studies, maximizing the coverage of protein coding sequences is essential, and prediction of these regions based on whole genome sequences alone is challenging. furthermore, identification of cis-regulatory regions is aided by improved gene annotations, since the 5’ untranslated sequences near the promoter are poorly conserved compared to protein coding sequences. alternate splicing is a mechanism that greatly increases the diversity of transcripts from vertebrate genomes, but identification of isoforms requires transcript sequence data from a variety of tissues. reannotation of the anole genome suggests that for the genome 10k project
 <cit> , it will be necessary to carry out both whole genome and transcriptome sequencing efforts in order to achieve the comparative genomic goals.

CONCLUSIONS
with the release of the a. carolinensis genome, along with a first generation annotation provided by ncbi and ensembl, a growing foundation of genomic resources are available for the anole reptilian model. furthermore, genome annotations of this key reptilian model provide a valuable resource for genomic comparison with mammals, such as mice and humans. using rna-seq, we have improved the genome annotation for a. carolinensis, which includes  <dig>  transcript isoforms, many of which are complete with utr sequences. de novo transcriptome assembly also identified  <dig>  transcripts that are not well represented on the current anocar <dig>  genome build. this revised genome annotation and available transcriptomic sequences provide a resource for vertebrate comparative and functional studies. this work also highlights the need for additional genomic sequencing of a. carolinensis to fill in gaps and extend scaffolds, as well as further transcriptomic sequencing of additional tissues.

materials and methods
animals
all animals were maintained and research carried out according to institutional animal care and use committee guidelines of arizona state university. anolis carolinensis lizards were purchased from approved vendors  and were housed at 70% humidity. lighting and temperature were maintained for  <dig> hours at 28°c daylight and  <dig> hours at 22°c night. adult tissues were collected immediately after euthanasia. eggs were collected within one day of laying, typically at the 25- <dig> somite pair stage.

rna-seq
samples for rna-seq, including embryos, regenerating tail, original tail, dewlap skin, brain, heart, lung, liver, adrenal, ovary, and skeletal muscle were collected for extraction using the total rna protocol of the mirvana kit . for the regenerating tail, original tail,  <dig> and  <dig> somite-pair staged embryos, total rna samples were prepared using the ovation rna-seq kit  to generate double stranded cdna. illumina manufacturer protocols were followed to generate paired-end sequencing libraries. sequencing was carried out on the illumina hiseq  <dig> using paired-end chemistry with read lengths of  <dig> base pairs. strand-specific rna sequencing libraries were prepared for adrenal, brain, dewlap, pooled  <dig> and  <dig> somite staged embryos, heart, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, and ovary rna samples using the dutp protocol
 <cit> . the dutp strand-specific libraries were sequenced on the illumina hiseq using paired-end chemistry with read lengths of either  <dig> or  <dig> bp.

de novo assembly
non-directional rna-seq data was assembled using the abyss and trans-abyss pipeline
 <cit> . each sample was assembled in abyss using every 5th kmer ranging from 26bp to 96bp. these assemblies were then combined using trans-abyss to create a merged assembly with reduced redundancy. this merged assembly was then mapped to the genome using blat inside trans-abyss. de novo assembled contigs were then filtered to require at least 90% coverage of the contig to the genome and at least one  <dig> bp gap. because of its ability to utilize stranded information, trinity was used to assemble the strand-specific rna sequencing data using default parameters
 <cit> .

pasa alignment assembly
the de novo assembled transcripts from abyss/trans-abyss and trinity
 <cit> , as well as the contigs from the est data sets, were then assembled using the pasa reference genome guided assembly. seqclean was first used to remove illumina adapters and any contaminants listed in the univec databases from the de novo assembled transcripts and the est libraries. pasa alignment and assembly was then executed using default parameters and utilizing the strand-specific data when possible
 <cit> .

ab initio training  and prediction
in order to train ab initio gene prediction algorithms, a set of high confidence transcripts were extracted from the pasa assemblies from each rna sequencing data set. these transcripts were then combined and redundancy removed using cd-hit
 <cit> . this set of transcripts was then used to train gene identification parameters for augustus
 <cit> , as well as snap
 <cit>  inside maker2
 <cit> . each gene finder was then run to produce a set of ab initio predictions for the a. carolinensis genome.

evm annotation combiner/pasa updates
evidencemodeler
 <cit>  was utilized to combine ab initio gene predictions from augustus and snap, the ensembl build  <dig>  and the ncbi ref_anocar <dig>  gene predictions, in combination with ucsc reference protein alignments and a. carolinensis transcriptomic data from the pasa assembles. this initial annotation ignored alternate splicing and utrs. cufflinks assemblies derived from tophat alignments of the raw reads, as well as human and chicken refseq protein alignments carried out using exonerate, were used to guide a maker <dig> annotation update to include novel genes, utr sequences and alternative splicing isoforms
 <cit> . pasa was then again utilized to update this initial genome annotation from evm and maker <dig> to add alternate splicing and utr sequences based on transcript data
 <cit> . orthologues were then assigned to these annotations through finding overlapping gene annotations from ncbi or ensembl gene models. asu gene predictions that did not have an overlap with ncbi or ensembl genes were then assigned orthology by identifying the most similar vertebrate refseq protein using blastx inside blast2go
 <cit> .

reference guided assembly
to improve the annotations of genes located in regions interrupted by gaps in the genomic assembly, sequencing reads were used for reference guided transcript assembly. reads from each sample were first trimmed based on quality and mapped to the a. carolinensis genome using bowtie and tophat as described previously
 <cit> . read alignments and the evm gene models were then used to guide a reference annotation based transcript  assembly using cufflinks version  <dig> .0
 <cit> .

analysis of transcript contigs that failed to align to the anocar <dig>  genome assembly
all tissue-specific contigs that failed to align to the anocar <dig>  genome assembly were processed and assembled using cap3
 <cit> . this second assembly step reduces redundancy between the assemblies from each sample and extends any partial transcripts contained within individual sample assemblies. transcripts were filtered to remove >33% percentage of repetitive sequences using repeatmasker
 <cit>  and remaining transcripts that contained open reading frames longer than  <dig> amino acids were then extracted from the cap <dig> assembly for further analysis. because cap <dig> tended to reconstruct more complete transcripts, these transcripts containing orfs longer than  <dig> amino acids were then realigned to the genome using blat and alignments covering greater than 70% of the transcript at 90% identity were removed
 <cit> . the filtered transcript contigs were then assigned orthology based on a best blastx match to vertebrate refseq proteins using blast2go
 <cit> .
