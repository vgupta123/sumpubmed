BACKGROUND
deinococcus radiodurans
deinococcus radiodurans  exhibits an extraordinary resistance to ionizing radiation. ionizing radiation generates a variety of dna damages, including many types of base damages as well as single-strand and double-strand breaks, the latter being the most lethal damage for a living cell. d. radiodurans can survive irradiation up to  <dig>  gy without measurable loss of viability, and it seems likely that this resistance is based on mechanisms that ensure limited dna and protein degradation and provide an efficient and accurate dna strand-break repair  <cit> . high intracellular levels of mn protect proteins and allow fast repair of damaged dna after irradiation  <cit> . prokaryotes can repair double-strand breaks by homologous recombination, but proteins implicated in non-homologous end-joining have also been identified recently, such as ku homologs and additional dna ligases  <cit> . however, no ku homolog has been discovered in the genome of d. radiodurans. zahradka et al. found that a mechanism called extended synthesis-dependent strand-annealing accounts for most of the strand-break repair  <cit> , although additional dna repair pathways might contribute to the efficient dna repair. in any case, a dna ligase is essential for dna repair and a 5'-polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase would ensure that dna strand-breaks could be invariably ligated.

dna ligases
dna ligases play essential roles in replication, recombination and repair since they join broken dna strands by catalysing the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3' hydroxyl end of one strand and the 5' phosphate end of another. ligation occurs via three nucleotidyltransfer steps:  a covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate is formed,  the adenylate group  is transferred to the 5'-phosphate terminus of the dna molecule and  the gap in the dna molecule is sealed when the dna ligase catalyses displacement of the amp residue through the attack by the adjacent 3' hydroxyl group of the dna  <cit> . for all dna ligases, the amp is linked to a highly conserved lysine residue in the catalytic motif of the enzyme. dna ligases can use either atp or nad+ as an amp-donor. nad+-dependent dna ligases are found exclusively in bacteria, certain archaea, and viruses whereas atp-dependent dna ligases can be found in eukaryotes, archaea and several viruses including bacteriophages. recently, it was shown that some bacterial genomes also encode an additional atp-dependent dna ligase, some of which were further characterised  <cit> .

the d. radiodurans genome contains the gene dr <dig> encoding an nad+-dependent dna ligase, here designated as liga. the gene drb <dig> encodes another possible diverged homolog of atp-dependent ligases. as the function of this protein remains unclear it will be called drb <dig> throughout this paper. this predicted atp-dependent dna ligase contains all catalytic residues, and its expression is strongly upregulated upon γ-irradiation  <cit> . in addition, drb <dig> belongs to a putative dna repair operon together with the genes drb <dig> and drb <dig>  drb <dig> has been predicted to encode a kinase/phosphatase with an unusual domain architecture  <cit>  whereas drb <dig> is classified as a domain of unknown function with weak similarity to the macro domain family  <cit> .

polynucleotide kinases and 3' phosphatases
not all dna strand breaks possess ligatable ends, i.e. a 5' phosphate and a 3' oh terminus. the 5' phosphate can be missing and γ-irradiation and reactive oxygen can lead to the formation of 3' phosphate or phosphoglycolate ends  <cit> . enzymatic activity is required to remove the 3' phosphate moiety and to phosphorylate the 5' end at the dna nick to allow for dna ligation. both reactions are catalysed by bifunctional pnkps. the best characterised pnkp is t <dig> pnk that is involved in the repair of host trna  <cit> . additional pnkps were identified in other viruses and all these viral enzymes can use either dna or rna as a substrate. pnkps were also found in some eukaryotes, e.g. human, caenorhabditis elegans and schizosaccharomyces pombe, where they seem to play an important role in the repair of single-strand and double-strand breaks  <cit> . however, the eukaryotic enzymes can only use dna as a substrate. pnk <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe possesses both 3'-phosphatase and 5'-polynucleotide kinase activities, whereas tpp <dig> from saccharomyces cerevisiae shows only 3'-phosphatase activity. in other organisms, the kinase and phosphatase activities seem to be uncoupled as well, e.g. in arabidopsis thaliana. only one bacterial pnkp from clostridium thermocellum has been characterised so far  <cit> , showing similarity to viral pnkps. d. radiodurans also seems to possess a pnkp encoded by the gene drb <dig>  although the pnkp possesses a special domain architecture  <cit> . the order of the phosphatase and kinase domains is the similar to eukaryotic pnkps; in contrast, viral pnkps have a reversed order of the two domains. the predicted phosphatase domain of the d. radiodurans pnkp belongs to the hd hydrolase superfamily  <cit> , and, so far, only one viral pnkp containing this domain has been shown to possess 3'-phosphatase activity  <cit> . the d. radiodurans pnkp is part of the putative dna repair operon together with the predicted atp-dependent dna ligase drb <dig> and the expression of this operon is strongly upregulated upon irradiation. thus, a role for the encoded proteins in dna repair has been suggested  <cit> .

in this work we analyse two putative dna ligases and one predicted 5'-polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase from deinococcus radiodurans.

RESULTS
prediction of two dna ligases for d. radiodurans
sequence comparison of the two predicted d. radiodurans dna ligases with other bacterial dna ligases showed that liga displays a strong similarity to other nad+-dependent dna ligases  and comprises the expected adenylation, ob fold and brct domains. like other nad+-dependent dna ligases liga also contains a zinc finger and a helix-hairpin-helix motif presumably involved in dna binding . by contrast, the predicted atp-dependent dna ligase drb <dig> shows poor sequence similarity to other bacterial atp-dependent ligases, but contains all catalytic residues . the drb <dig> protein consists of the adenylation domain only and lacks all other domains present in liga ; especially no dna binding motif could be detected.

purification of two recombinant dna ligases from d. radiodurans
both genes encoding putative dna ligases, drb <dig> and dr <dig>  were amplified from genomic d. radiodurans dna using specific primers  and cloned into a prsetb vector for recombinant protein expression in e. coli cells with a hexahistidine tag at the n terminus. for both proteins, adenylation mutants were created by replacing the conserved lysine residue with an alanine, resulting in a drb <dig> k40a mutant and a liga k128a mutant, respectively. all wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells and purified to near homogeneity over a histrap™ hp column and two additional ion exchange columns .

all oligonucleotides were desalted and used in a final concentration of  <dig>  μm. t <dig> sequencing primers can be found at the microsynth webpage. bold bases represent those exchanged in the site-directed mutagenesis. restriction sites are shown in italics.

a dna ligase from d. radiodurans performs efficient strand joining in the presence of nad+ and mn and possesses adenylyltransferase activity
we tested the ability of the liga wt and the k128a mutant to ligate a duplex dna substrate containing a single nick. ligase activity was measured as conversion of a 5'--labelled deoxyribose oligomer of  <dig> nucleotides into an internally labelled oligomer of  <dig> nucleotides. liga showed maximum ligation activity with  <dig> mm mncl <dig>   <dig> μm nad+ and a ph of  <dig>  at a temperature of 30°c. higher concentrations of mncl <dig> or nad+ had an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity. the enzyme was  <dig> times less active in the presence of mgcl <dig>  and even inactive when tested with  <dig> mm atp . to exclude the possibility that the observed activity is caused by a copurified e. coli ligase, we created a k128a mutant that lacks the proposed site of adenylation . the liga k128a mutant showed almost no ligation activity confirming that the observed ligation activity results from the d. radiodurans nad+-dependent dna ligase . the residual dna ligation does probably not result from a contamination with e. coli dna ligase, as the activity was strongly decreased in presence of  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  which is optimal for e. coli dna ligase . in an adenylyltransferase activity assay liga wt formed an amp-ligase complex, whereas complex formation was not detected with the k128a mutant . thus, lysine  <dig> is essential for the first step of dna ligation. the kinetic analysis of the wt reaction using different concentrations of nicked dna displayed typical michaelis-menten kinetics with an apparent km of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm .

km values for nicked dna substrates. details for km determination of d. radiodurans nad+-dependent dna ligase are described in methods. km is the mean of  <dig> independent experiments and the error is given as standard error of the mean.

divalent cation dependence and specificity of the dna strand-joining by liga
ligation of a nicked dna by liga required a divalent cation cofactor and was best in the presence of  <dig> mm mncl <dig> . mncl <dig> could be replaced by mgcl <dig> or cacl <dig> leading however to a 10-fold decrease of activity . the optimal concentration of divalent cation was  <dig> mm for mgcl <dig> and  <dig> mm for cacl <dig>  only low levels of dna ligation were observed with nicl <dig> and zncl <dig>  the optimal concentrations being  <dig> and  <dig> mm, respectively . cocl <dig> could not serve as a divalent cation cofactor .

drb <dig>  a predicted atp-dependent dna ligase from d. radiodurans, forms a complex with amp, but does not ligate dna or rna in vitro
drb <dig> has been predicted to be an atp-dependent dna ligase consisting only of the adenylation domain. we first tested whether the drb <dig> protein possesses an adenylation activity using atp as an amp-donor and whether lysine residue  <dig> is indeed essential for amp binding. the adenylyltransferase activity was tested by incubating  <dig> μg of recombinant protein with α--atp. a complex was formed between the wild-type protein and -amp, which was completely absent for the k40a mutant, confirming that drb <dig> possesses adenylyltransferase activity and therefore belongs to the family of nucleotidyltransferases . we further tested whether drb <dig> is able to ligate dna or rna substrates using nad+ or atp as a cofactor. however, we did not detect a ligation product with any conditions used .

purification of a putative 5'-polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase from d. radiodurans with an unusual domain architecture
the pnkp encoded by d. radiodurans has a phosphatase-kinase domain architecture similar to the eukaryotic pnkps. in contrast, the viral t <dig> pnk has a reverse domain order with the kinase domain at the n-terminus and the phosphatase domain at the c-terminus. comparison of d. radiodurans and human pnkp shows that the bacterial protein is smaller than the human homolog and contains a phosphatase domain belonging to the superfamily of hd phosphohydrolases. the human enzyme contains a distinct phosphatase domain with some similarity to histidinol phosphatase and related phosphatases .

the gene drb <dig> encoding a putative pnkp was amplified via pcr from genomic d. radiodurans dna. the gene was cloned into a prsetb vector and arginine  <dig> was mutated to lysine using mutagenic primers for pcr. arginine  <dig> was chosen based on sequence comparisons with the well-characterised t <dig> pnk. we estimated that it should correspond to arginine  <dig> in t <dig> pnk, which is required for polynucleotide kinase activity  <cit> .

both proteins, drb <dig> wt and drb <dig> r371k were expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells with an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag. the proteins were purified over a histrap hp™ column, a hitrap heparin hp™ column and finally a hitrap sp hp™ column to apparent homogeneity .

analysis of the d. radiodurans pnkp polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase activity
polynucleotide activity for the d. radiodurans pnkp was shown as transfer of 32pi from γ--atp to the 5'oh end of a  <dig> mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide. the resulting 5'-labelled product was separated from the free γ--atp by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. the wild-type protein showed clear 5'-polynucleotide kinase activity with an optimal mncl <dig> concentration of only  <dig>  mm. mutation of arginine  <dig> to a lysine strongly reduced the enzymatic activity , confirming that the kinase activity is intrinsic to the c-terminal domain. furthermore, as e. coli does not possess a polynucleotide kinase, a contamination can be excluded.

the 3'-phosphatase activity was analysed as conversion of a non-ligatable dna nick, which is "blocked" by a 3' po <dig> moiety, to a normal 3'oh-5'po <dig> nick that can be subsequently joined by a dna ligase. both, d. radiodurans liga and t <dig> dna ligase, were able to ligate the blocked substrate if pnkp was present . even though 3'-phosphatase activity has been detected, we cannot conclude whether this activity is intrinsic to the pnkp or not. samples purified from e. coli cells containing only the empty expression vector contained unspecific 3'-phosphatase activity as well and h81a or d82e mutants of drb <dig> did not show any reduced 3'-phosphatase activity, although these two residues represent the conserved hd motif . an enzymatic mutant of drb <dig> is required to definitely decide this open question.

discussion
dna ligases are important enzymes acting in dna replication, recombination and repair. they can be classified by cofactor requirement: those requiring nad+ and those requiring atp  <cit> . for many years it was believed that bacteria possess only nad+-dependent dna ligases. however, several years ago, it became clear that some bacteria contain an atp-dependent dna ligase in addition to their nad+-dependent dna ligase  <cit> . the presence of these ligases suggested that prokaryotes, similar to eukaryotes, could have specific dna ligases that act in dna repair and recombination.

in this work, we report the identification of liga, an nad+-dependent dna ligase, and a second putative atp-dependent dna ligase in the radioresistant bacterium d. radiodurans. nad+-dependent dna ligases are highly conserved and it is likely that they are essential for all bacteria  <cit> . d. radiodurans liga showed strong ligation activity on a nicked dna substrate in the presence of nad+ and mncl <dig>  but only a weak activity in the presence of mgcl <dig>  this mn2+ preference is not surprising since it was shown that these ions are present in extremely high levels at the d. radiodurans dna  <cit>  and are essential for γ-radiation resistance  <cit> . moreover, several dna repair enzymes from d. radiodurans, such as uv endonuclease β  <cit>  or a family x dna polymerase with a structure-modulated nuclease activity  <cit> , are strongly stimulated by mncl <dig>  the first step in the ligation process is the formation of an adenylated ligase. according to sequence alignment with other nad+-dependent dna ligases, adenylation of the liga protein is predicted to occur on lysine  <dig>  indeed, a mutation of this lysine residue to alanine abolished the ligation as well the adenylation activity.

the product of the d. radiodurans gene drb <dig>  a diverged homolog of atp-dependent dna ligases, contains most of the conserved amino acid residues characteristic of dna ligases and was shown to be strongly upregulated upon γ-irradation  <cit> . we could show that this protein possesses adenylyltransferase activity using α--atp as a substrate and that the adenylation occurs specifically at the conserved lysine  <dig>  this transfer of radioactivity to the wild-type enzyme, but not to the k40a mutant, indicates a covalent modification of the respective lysine residue as observed for other ligases. this places drb <dig> in the family of nucleotidyltransferases that includes dna and rna ligases as well as rna capping enzymes. as rna capping is not characterised for prokaryotes, we focussed our work on the possible ligation activity. however, to our knowledge the presence of rna capping has not been investigated in d. radiodurans and can therefore not completely be excluded. although different cofactors and various buffer conditions as well as different substrates were used, and the hexa-histidine tag was transferred from the n- to the c-terminus of the protein, we were not able to show that drb <dig> is active as a dna or rna ligase. nicked dna substrates, nicked dna-rna hybrids prepared by annealing of a 5' po <dig> and a 3' oh rna strand to a template dna strand, single-stranded rna and double-stranded dna with blunt-ends or overhangs were tested . in addition, we analysed total d. radiodurans extract with or without previous γ-irradiation for dna ligation activity; however no atp-dependent ligation activity was detectable, even though nad+-dependent dna ligation could be easily detected . drb <dig> does not contain any conventional dna binding motif, suggesting that an additional protein is required for recruitment to nicked dna.

as drb <dig> is part of a putative repair operon drb0098-drb <dig>  we purified the other two proteins to analyse whether the three operon proteins would form a complex capable of dna ligation. drb <dig> contains a hd-hydrolase family phosphatase domain and a polynucleotide kinase domain and resembles the human repair protein pnkp  <cit> ; drb <dig> is an open reading frame with unknown function and weak similarity to macro domains  <cit> . no dna ligation was detected with any of these three operon proteins or in combinations thereof; thus, we propose the existence of a yet unidentified additional protein involved in the ligation process of drb <dig>  moreover, it cannot be excluded that drb <dig> ligates only special substrates such as specific dna sequences or rna intermediates. interestingly, in several bacteria genes coding for an atp-dependent dna ligase have been identified in operons with ku-homologs. the ku proteins might recruit the dna ligase to dna strand-breaks as is it the case in mammalian cells  <cit> . in d. radiodurans, however, no ku-homolog has been identified so far. another interesting protein that might function in a ku-like manner is the repair protein ppra from d. radiodurans, which has been shown to tether dna ends and to stimulate atp- and nad+-dependent dna ligases  <cit> . the atp-dependent dna ligase might function as a backup system to provide additional ligation activity under conditions of high genotoxic stress.

in this work, we furthermore characterised a novel pnkp from d. radiodurans, which phosphorylates 5' oh termini. it remains unclear whether it is also able to remove 3' phosphate groups, thus converting "blocked" dna nicks to ligatable ones.

pnkps can be divided into two subgroups according to their domain architecture: the t4-like kinase-phosphatase proteins found in viruses with a function in rna repair, and the eukaryal-type phosphatase-kinase group involved in dna repair. the pnkp from d. radiodurans possesses a domain architecture that corresponds to the eukaryal type. so far, only one bacterial pnkp from chlostridium thermocellum has been described, which in contrast to the d. radiodurans pnkp contains a calcineurin-type phosphatase domain. this enzyme has been shown to possess 5'-polynucleotide kinase, 2'3'-phosphatase and adenylyltransferase activity and has been implicated in rna repair  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated if d. radiodurans pnkp is involved in dna or rna repair.

the d. radiodurans pnkp possesses an n-terminal phosphatase domain belonging to the hd superfamily. members of this family are known or predicted phosphohydrolases  <cit> , and a novel subfamily of pnkps consisting of a 5'-kinase and a 3'-hd phosphohydrolase domain has been proposed based on sequence similarities  <cit> . these enzymes have a conserved doublet of hd residues that is likely to be required for enzymatic activity. so far, only one pnkp has been shown to possess a 3'-phosphatase activity residing in the hd domain, but no mutational analysis is available for this enzyme from the bacteriophage rm <dig>  <cit> . however, it was shown, that site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved histidine in a cgmp-phosphodiesterase clearly reduced its catalytic activity  <cit> . we could show that d. radiodurans pnkp possesses 5'-polynucleotide kinase activity. however, the 3'-phosphatase activity detected in our assay might result from an unspecific e. coli 3'-phosphatase. h81a or d82e mutants of d. radiodurans pnkp did not show a reduced activity in our 3'-phosphatase assays . regarding the polynucleotide kinase activity, the absence of a 5'-polynucleotide kinase in e. coli and the reduced activity of the drb <dig> r371k mutant exclude the possibility of a contamination. in the case of the third protein of the putative repair operon, drb <dig>  binding to adp-ribose was detected and further work has to be done to elucidate whether adp-ribosylation might play a role in bacterial dna repair .

CONCLUSIONS
d. radiodurans possesses a classical nad+-dependent dna ligase  that shows a strong preference for mn as a cofactor. a second predicted atp-dependent dna ligase  shows adenylyltransferase activity, but no dna or rna ligation could be detected in vitro. a predicted 5'-polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase belonging to the same operon was able to convert 5' oh termini to 5' po <dig> termini, thus preparing dna ends for ligation. in conclusion, d. radiodurans pnkp and liga are able to heal and ligate dna nicks. it remains to be assessed whether they play any role in dna repair or rna repair in vivo. also the function of drb <dig> remains to be elucidated and further proteomic and genomic approaches might give more insight into these unsolved questions.
