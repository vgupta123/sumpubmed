BACKGROUND
determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration , based on antimicrobial activity against planktonic organisms, is the standard assay for susceptibility testing. biofilms, which present with distinct physiology compared to planktonic cells, are infamous for their ability to withstand a wide range of antimicrobials, including metals  <cit> . despite the ubiquitous distribution of metals and the predominance of microbial biofilms in the environment and in device-associated infections, very few studies have comparatively examined biofilm susceptibility to metals relative to planktonic cells. the scarcity of data in this regard may be attributable to the existing methods used to grow biofilms, which typically include contamination prone flow systems. metal susceptibility testing also entails challenges not encountered with antibiotics. this includes complexation of metals with components of growth media, inorganic precipitation, reduction reactions, and carry-over of the metal to the recovery medium.

a recently developed, high-throughput approach to antibiotic and biocide susceptibility testing of microbial biofilms is the calgary biofilm device  <cit>   assay, mbec bioproducts inc., edmonton, alberta, canada  <cit> ). this batch culture method of biofilm and planktonic cell susceptibility testing provides three internally consistent, comparative measurements from a single experiment: 1) the planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration , 2) the planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration , and 3) the minimum biofilm eradication concentration . the mbec assay is not prone to leakage and contamination since it is manipulated in a laminar flow hood.

the present study was rooted in two principle aims. the first aim was to develop a method of high-throughput metal susceptibility testing of biofilms using the mbec assay. as part of this goal, a metal specific neutralizing regime was employed to reduce the biological toxicity of many different metal cations and oxyanions in vitro. this procedure allowed for comparisons between the susceptibility of planktonic cells and biofilms to metals , and provides a significant modification of the procedure originally reported by ceri et al. for antibiotic susceptibility testing  <cit> . also presented here is quality control data for the mbec technique that has not been published elsewhere.

the second aim was to apply this method to examine variables that may influence measurements of metal susceptibility. a common dilemma in comparative studies of different bacterial strains is the ability of each strain to form biofilms. in simple terms, the ratio of bacterial cells  to metal ions may influence the determination of susceptibility. to address this, biofilm growth of different bacterial species was calibrated to allow relative comparisons of susceptibility between biofilms with similar cell densities. here, the relative differences in e. coli and p. aeruginosa biofilm susceptibility to the heavy metalloid oxyanions selenite  and tellurite  were examined. these compounds are highly toxic, water soluble pollutants that are spread into the environment in the form of industrial effluent  <cit> . p. aeruginosa was  <dig> times more resistant to heavy metalloids than e. coli.

another potential obstacle to accurate measurements from metal susceptibility testing is exposure time. studies of short duration metal exposure in minimal media have indicated that biofilms are highly tolerant to heavy metals  <cit> , whereas long exposures in rich media resulted in complete elimination of the biofilm  <cit> . logically, these differences may be based on differences in either exposure time or growth medium. here, the effect of these variables on the measured tolerance of e. coli biofilms to metal cations was examined. time-dependent trends in biofilm susceptibility to metals were identified that were not altered by changing the medium in which bacteria were grown or challenged. exposure time is thus an important consideration in the design of studies centred on biofilm tolerance to metals.

RESULTS
biofilm growth
biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  e. coli tg <dig>  and e. coli jm <dig> were grown to an overall mean density of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log <dig> cfu peg- <dig>  in luria-bertani medium enriched with vitamin b <dig> . this corresponded to  <dig>  and  <dig> h of incubation at 35°c for p. aeruginosa and e. coli, respectively. when grown in minimal salts vitamins glucose  medium for  <dig> h at 35°c, biofilms of e. coli jm <dig> reached a mean cell density of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log <dig> cfu peg- <dig>  mean and standard deviation calculations for cell densities were based on pooled data from all growth controls performed .

mean viable cell counts and standard deviation  for p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and e. coli tg <dig> on the pegs of each row of the mbec™-htp assay are presented in . the cell counts for each row were pooled and compared using one-way analysis of variance . the cell density of biofilms grown on the different rows of pegs in the mbec™-htp assay were statistically equivalent . e. coli jm <dig> also formed statistically equivalent biofilms across the different rows of pegs. this was similar to e. coli tg <dig>  and thus the data is not presented here.

to allow for a valid comparison of susceptibility data, the biofilm cell counts for p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and e. coli tg <dig> were compared using a mann-whitney u-test. the biofilm cell density of these two strains were statistically equivalent . under the growth conditions reported, e. coli jm <dig> formed biofilms with significantly less cell density than the other  <dig> strains when compared using a mann-whitney u-test .

microscopy
biofilms were examined in situ using scanning electron microscopy. photomicrographs of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and e. coli tg <dig> are presented in . sem pictures show the growth of surface-adherent bacteria in thin layers and mounds on the pegs of the mbec™ device. these layers were estimated to be up to  <dig> μm in height in some areas. biofilms heterogeneously covered the plastic surface. the biofilm growth of e. coli jm <dig> was similar to strain tg <dig>  except with a slightly more sparse distribution across the peg surface .

susceptibility of e. coli and p. aeruginosa to metalloid oxyanions
in this study and as an example, biofilms of escherichia coli tg <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were assayed for susceptibility to selenite  and tellurite . these two organisms formed biofilms with statistically equivalent cell density when grown as described above. this allowed for a direct comparison between the two bacterial strains for relative levels of resistance to these heavy metalloid oxyanions.

for e. coli tg <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  the mean and standard deviation of mic, mbc and mbec values for seo32- and teo32- are summarized in table  <dig>  these calculations were based on  <dig> to  <dig> independent replicates each. with  <dig> h of exposure, biofilms were up to  <dig> times more tolerant to teo32- than the corresponding planktonic cultures. with regards to planktonic cells , p. aeruginosa was  <dig> times more resistant to tellurite than e. coli.

time-dependent susceptibility of e. coli biofilms to metal cations
exposure time may be of pivotal importance as a controlled variable in the design of metal susceptibility assays. to directly address this problem, an array of  <dig> metal cations was chosen to represent groups 7b to 4a of the periodic table. using the mbec assay, the susceptibility of e. coli jm <dig> to these compounds was tested. e. coli jm <dig> has been a popular model microorganism for studies of metal resistance in bacteria. biofilm and planktonic cell susceptibility at  <dig> and  <dig> h of exposure in both rich medium  and minimal medium  was examined. a larger data set with a greater number of trials at  <dig> h of exposure in lb + b <dig> was used in this study to expand on an original report  <cit> . all other test conditions were previously unexamined. this data is presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

in general, mic, mbc and mbec values were greater in rich medium than in minimal medium. this was probably due to the chelation of metal ions by phosphates and organic matter present in the growth medium. however, there were two trends that were invariant with regards to nutrient status: 1) in lb + b <dig>  biofilms were  <dig>  to  <dig> times more tolerant to metal cations than the corresponding planktonic cells when exposed for  <dig> h. similarly, e. coli biofilms grown and tested in msvg were  <dig>  to  <dig> times more tolerant to metal cations with a similar exposure time. in combination with the susceptibility data for seo32- and teo32-, this would suggest that with short exposures biofilms are highly tolerant to metal toxicity. 2) by  <dig> h of exposure, biofilm and planktonic cultures were eradicated at similar concentrations of metal cations in almost every instance. this occurred independently of the growth medium used for bacterial susceptibility testing.

collectively, these data suggest that biofilm tolerance to metals is time-dependent. we note that  mic values did not change with exposure time using this method .

discussion
this manuscript describes a high-throughput method for metal susceptibility testing of biofilms using the mbec assay. this technique has the advantage that metal susceptibility testing may be done using a combinatorial approach. it is possible to employ different mean numbers of bacterial cells, alternate exposure times, various and diverse growth media formulations, as well as a broad range of metals . many bacteria and yeasts, including staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , mycobacterium spp.  <cit> , candida spp. , and burholderia cepacia complex  <cit>  are amenable to biofilm growth using the mbec assay. biofilms on the pegs of the mbec device may be examined in situ using scanning electron microscopy, epifluorescent microscopy  <cit> , and confocal laser-scanning microscopy   <cit> .

as a quality control, a test for equivalent biofilm formation between rows of pegs in the mbec device was performed. biofilm cell density was statistically equivalent across the different rows of pegs for e. coli tg <dig>  jm <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  this quality control needs to be a routine test for studies of biofilm susceptibility using this method. it is important to note that not all bacteria  are amenable to this method of growth . if statistically equivalent biofilms are not generated using the mbec trough format, it is possible to instead place the peg lid in a microtiter plate containing ~ <dig> μl of inoculum in each well. this alternative system may be placed on a gyrorotary shaker to facilitate biofilm formation on the peg lid. in general, biofilms formed using a trough have a 5- to 10-fold greater cell density than those formed using the microtiter plate format .

this procedure may be modified to discern biofilm and planktonic viable cell counts. this is included as an amendment with the online supplementary material. viable cell counting is accomplished by serially diluting aliquots from the recovery and neutralization plates, which are subsequently plated onto agar and enumerated. a characteristic of the mbec assay is that planktonic cultures are seeded by cells shed from the biofilm. log-killing of biofilms may be calculated using this method, but as a consequence, log-killing of planktonic cells may not. however, this model does reflect the natural duality of the bacterial life cycle where a recalcitrant nidus of biofilm cells may survive metal exposure to shed planktonic cells back into the surroundings. antibiotic mic values obtained from this method are in most cases equivalent to mic data derived from national committee of clinical laboratory standards  standard procedures  <cit> . in this report, mic and mbc values for teo32- were consistent with literature values obtained using alternate methods  <cit> .

the use of neutralizing agents in metal susceptibility testing allows for more accurate comparisons between the susceptibility of planktonic cells and biofilms to metals. metal carry over from challenge to recovery media can affect the determination of viable cell counts and bactericidal concentrations  <cit> . pertinent to this method, carry over is of particular concern when comparing biofilm and planktonic cell mbec and mbc values. for example, planktonic cells removed in media containing metals will be inhibited to a different extent during recovery than biofilms removed from the media containing metals. in this protocol, biofilms and planktonic cultures were treated with equal amounts of a neutralizing agent at a concentration with limited toxicity to the bacterial cells. biofilm and planktonic cells were equally susceptible to metals with long exposure times, suggesting that the neutralizing agents are equivalently effective for the treatment of both bacterial forms. the limitation of chemical neutralization will be acknowledged here. treating metal exposed biofilms with a chelator increases the number of viable cells recovered from killing kinetics experiments relative to identical experiments that do not use a neutralizing agent . however, it is very likely that the metal-chelator complex is toxic to bacteria  <cit> . the bottom line of this procedure is that the metal-chelator is less toxic than the free metal ion.

luria-bertani medium is appropriate for susceptibility testing of metal oxyanions, as these compounds remain soluble in this medium. in the case of metal cations, precipitation and/or complexation of metals occurs rapidly in rich media. in this instance, minimal media preparations may be more suitable . although the absolute values of mic, mbc and mbec determinations were greater in rich than in minimal medium, the tolerance of biofilms to metal toxicity remained time-dependent in both growth conditions.

reports in the literature have suggested that biofilm tolerance to metals may be time-dependent  <cit> . biofilms of p. aeruginosa are up to  <dig> times more tolerant to heavy metals than planktonic cells   <cit> . using the mbec assay, it has been noted for p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and e. coli that biofilms and planktonic cells are equally susceptible to metal cations   <cit> . similar time-dependent phenomena have been previously described for the killing of e. coli jm <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> biofilms by seo32- and teo32-  <cit> . here this has been revaluated and this study demonstrates that the foundation of this is exposure time. thus, the amount of time bacteria are exposed to toxic metals is an important controlled variable that contributes to measurements of bacterial susceptibility to metals. this is important both in terms of comparisons of biofilm and planktonic cell tolerance to metals as well as in evaluation of data in the literature.

CONCLUSIONS
this high-throughput method is currently being used to elucidate a multifactorial model of metal tolerance in the bacterial biofilm  <cit> . the principle strength of this assay lies in the ability to rapidly screen changes in biofilm susceptibility to metals using diverse permutations of growth conditions, exposure times, and metal compounds. this type of combinatorial experimental approach would not be pragmatic using other methods.

the growth of different microorganisms may be calibrated to compare biofilms of equivalent cell density. this means that it is possible to compare susceptibility data of different strains without the concern that differences in resistance and/or tolerance are due to inequalities in growth of the biofilm populations. lastly, exposure time influences the observed tolerance of biofilms to metals. exposure time is thus a key consideration in the design of metal susceptibility assays.
