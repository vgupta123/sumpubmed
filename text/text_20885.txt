BACKGROUND
remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for mediating changes in cell shape, migration, and adhesion. actin filament architecture is regulated by a large group of actin binding proteins that modulate actin assembly, disassembly, branching, and bundling  <cit> . actin organization is also regulated by growth factor signals that stimulate the activity of rho family gtpases, which mediate actin remodeling and formation of stress fibers, filopodia, and membrane ruffles  <cit> . although much has been learned about the general properties of actin binding proteins, the mechanisms by which these proteins control actin architecture in vivo are poorly understood.

eps <dig>  was originally identified as a substrate of the egf receptor  <cit>  and is the founding member of a multigene family of eps8-like proteins named eps8l <dig>  eps8l <dig>  and eps8l <dig>  <cit> . eps <dig> is thought to transduce growth factor signals by acting as a scaffold protein to support the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes that promote the activation of rho family gtpases. consistent with this model, studies in eps <dig> null fibroblasts showed that eps <dig> is required for growth factor-induced rac activation as well as rac-dependent actin remodeling and membrane ruffling  <cit> . eps <dig> is a critical component of a complex that contains the p <dig> regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, abi <dig>  and sos <dig>  which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for rac  <cit> . eps <dig> interacts directly with abi <dig> through its sh <dig> domain, which possesses a novel peptide binding specificity  <cit> , and this binding is thought to relieve auto-inhibition of eps <dig>  <cit> .

eps <dig> also directly binds actin, suggesting that it may function by localizing rac to sites of actin remodeling  <cit> . eps <dig> binds actin through its c-terminal effector domain and expression of the effector region in serum-starved cells elicits rac-dependent actin remodeling and membrane ruffling  <cit> . studies using deletion mutants of eps <dig> show that the c-terminal effector domain is required for localizing eps <dig> to membrane ruffles and the transduction of signals to rac  <cit> . a recent study revealed that c-terminal fragments of eps <dig> also possess actin barbed-end capping activity in vitro and can substitute for capping protein in actin-based motility assays, suggesting a mechanism by which eps <dig> might regulate actin filament dynamics in vivo  <cit> . interestingly, full-length eps <dig> on its own lacks capping activity in vitro, but can block actin polymerization in the presence of abi <dig>  <cit> . the capping activity of eps <dig> does not require rac indicating that eps <dig> can modulate actin dynamics through rac-dependent and -independent mechanisms. together, these data implicate eps <dig> as a key regulator of actin filament dynamics and suggest that its activity is modulated through association with distinct sets of interacting regulatory proteins.

eps <dig> has also been shown to bind dishevelled   <cit> , a key regulator of canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . dsh is required for the establishment of cell polarity and directed migration during gastrulation in vertebrates  <cit> . the mechanism by which dsh controls cell polarity and migration is unclear, but is hypothesized to involve the modulation of actin dynamics through activation of rhoa and rac  <cit> . the ability of eps <dig> to bind both dsh and actin and stimulate rac activation suggests that eps <dig> may play an important role in regulating dsh function during gastrulation, but this possibility has not been investigated.

in this study, we utilized cultured mammalian cells and xenopus embryos as model systems to investigate the mechanism by which eps <dig> regulates actin filament architecture in vivo. our results provide evidence that eps <dig> can stimulate the assembly of distinct types of actin-based structures in cells and that the morphology of the actin structures induced by eps <dig> is dependent on its interactions with abi <dig>  in addition, we show that eps <dig> can recruit actin regulatory proteins, such as n-wasp and dsh, to actin filaments and that mis-expression of eps <dig> impairs cell movements during gastrulation in xenopus embryos. together, these data suggest that the role of eps <dig> in modulating actin organization is multifaceted and is dependent on its participation in several potentially distinct multi-protein actin regulatory complexes.

RESULTS
enhanced formation of filopodia-like structures in cells expressing eps8
to gain insights into the role eps <dig> plays in regulating actin filament architecture, we examined the effect of increasing eps <dig> levels on actin remodeling in mammalian cultured cells. for these studies, we utilized the mouse melanoma cell line b16f <dig>  <cit> , the human breast cancer cell line mda-mb <dig>  <cit> , and the mda-mb231bo cell line, which is a highly metastatic, bone seeking clone of the parental line  <cit> . these cells were chosen because they are highly motile and express a variety of cellular protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia. control b16f <dig>  mda-mb <dig>  and mda-231bo cells stained for actin are shown in figure  <dig>  we found that expression of a c-myc epitope tagged version of mouse eps <dig>  in b16f <dig> cells elicited the formation of filopodia-like structures, which stained brightly with phalloidin . the filopodia-like structures extended from lateral and dorsal regions of the cell and eps <dig> localized along the length of these protrusions and was enriched at their tips . similar results were seen in mda-mb <dig>  and mda-mb231bo  breast cancer cells. more than 90% of the transfected cells displayed the actin phenotype shown. we also observed the formation of long, snake-like actin cables in approximately 50% of the mda-mb231bo cells, which were typically not seen in either b16f <dig> cells or the parental mda-mb <dig> cells.

abi <dig> modulates eps8-dependent actin remodeling
to test whether abi <dig> can modulate the activity of eps <dig> in cultured cells we examined the effect of co-expressing eps <dig> and abi <dig> on actin architecture. similar to data reported previously  <cit> , simultaneous expression of eps8-myc and abi1-gfp in b16f <dig>  mda-mb <dig>  and mda-mb231bo cells resulted in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton characterized by formation of cable-like actin bundles within the cytoplasm . the actin cables were typically found at the ventral surface of the cell and displayed few branches. eps <dig> and abi <dig> co-localized along the length of the actin cables. interestingly, abi <dig> was not enriched with eps <dig> in filopodia-like structures , suggesting that abi <dig> may not contribute to eps8-function at the plasma membrane. more than 95% of transfected cells displayed the actin phenotype shown. expression of abi <dig> alone  or an abi <dig> mutant  unable to bind eps <dig>  <cit>  failed to stimulate actin cable formation , indicating that the ability of eps <dig> to induce actin cables is dependent on its interaction with abi <dig> 

eps <dig> induces actin remodeling in xenopus embryos
to further examine the role of eps <dig> in regulating actin architecture, we utilized xenopus animal cap explants, which provide a powerful system for analyzing protein localization and function in vivo. animal caps explants are dissected from blastula stage embryos and consist of an outer polarized epithelium and 2– <dig> layers of non-epithelial deep cells. we found that expression of eps <dig> has different effects on actin organization in superficial epithelial cells versus deep cells. in control explants, actin filaments are enriched at apical cell-cell junctions in superficial epithelial cells  and at the cortex of deep cells facing the blastocoel . in superficial epithelial cells, eps <dig> expression caused an accumulation of actin filaments at sites of cell-cell contact in apparent association with adherens junctions . in contrast, eps <dig> expression induced the formation of cable-like actin structures within the cytoplasm of deep cells  and modified the morphology of actin filaments at the cell cortex . the morphology and length of the actin structures in deep cells was variable; long, unbranched filaments were observed in cortical regions in association with the free membrane domain that faces the blastocoel, whereas thick actin bundles were often seen throughout the cytoplasm. staining of animal caps with anti-myc antibodies showed that eps8-myc localized along the length of actin filaments in both deep and superficial cells . thus, eps <dig> associates with actin filaments and can dramatically affect the organization of actin in xenopus animal cap cells as it does in cultured cells.

abi <dig> modulates the activity of eps <dig> in xenopus embryos
to test whether abi <dig> can regulate eps <dig> function in xenopus embryos, we co-expressed eps8-myc and abi1-gfp in animal cap cells and analyzed the localization of eps <dig>  abi <dig>  and actin by confocal microscopy. we found that when expressed alone, abi1-gfp localized to small aggregates found throughout the cytoplasm and did not affect actin organization . in contrast, simultaneous expression of eps8-myc and abi1-gfp induced the formation of star-like actin structures in superficial epithelial cells of the animal cap . actin stars were found at the apical surface and consisted of actin-containing spikes radiating from a central actin foci or short bundle. the actin stars did not appear to protrude from the apical surface and eps <dig> and abi <dig> co-localized with actin in the stars. since eps <dig> and abi <dig> facilitate signaling through rac in cultured cells we tested whether actin star formation was dependent on rac. in control animal caps, endogenous rac was enriched at the cell cortex in association with cell-cell junctions . in animal caps expressing eps <dig> and abi <dig>  rac was not recruited to the actin stars  suggesting that rac activity is not required for actin star formation. in agreement with this idea, expression of dominant negative rac  failed to inhibit eps8/abi1-induced actin star formation . thus, abi <dig> modulates eps <dig> activity in xenopus and eps <dig> and abi <dig> can stimulate actin remodeling in a rac-independent manner.

recruitment of actin regulatory proteins to eps8/abi1-induced actin structures in xenopus
eps <dig> has been shown to possess abi1-dependent barbed-end capping activity in vitro  <cit> , suggesting that the effects we observed in xenopus may be due to increased capping of actin filaments. to test this idea, we analyzed whether expression of capping protein induced similar changes in actin organization. capping protein  is an α/β heterodimer that is thought to provide the major barbed-end capping activity in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in these experiments, animal caps expressing both the α and β subunits of cp were examined for changes in actin filament distribution. in addition, since both the α and β subunits were gfp-tagged, their expression was confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-gfp antibodies . we found that expression of cp had no effect on actin organization in animal cap cells . in addition, we found that expression of capping protein did not block the formation of eps8/abi1-induced actin stars, although low levels of capping protein were found to co-localize with the actin stars . thus, the formation of actin stars does not directly correlate with enhanced capping protein activity nor does enhanced capping protein activity affect eps8/abi1-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

wasp/scar proteins play an important role in stimulating actin filament nucleation by the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . to test whether the formation of actin stars involves recruitment of wasp proteins we analyzed the distribution of n-wasp-gfp in animal cap cells expressing eps <dig> and abi <dig>  n-wasp co-localized with eps <dig> and actin , indicating that wasp proteins are recruited to eps8/abi1-induced actin structures. we also tested whether n-wasp activity is required for eps8/abi1-induced actin star formation by co-expressing eps <dig>  abi <dig> and a dominant negative form of n-wasp . we found that n-wasp-ca expression did not significantly alter the actin structures induced by eps <dig> and abi <dig> . these data suggest that eps <dig> and abi <dig> can recruit actin nucleators to specific sites in the cell, although n-wasp function may not be strictly required for eps8/abi1-induced actin remodeling.

members of the ena/vasp family are critical regulators of actin filament dynamics and are thought to antagonize actin filament capping at the leading edge of migrating cells  <cit> . given this central role, we tested whether increased or decreased ena/vasp activity would affect eps8/abi1-induced actin star formation. expression of a dominant negative protein  that specifically neutralizes the function of all ena/vasp proteins was used to knockdown ena/vasp activity whereas expression gfp-tagged xenopus vasp  was used to increase ena/vasp activity. the ability of the fp4-mito dominant negative to mis-localize ena/vasp proteins in xenopus was confirmed by showing that it caused the redistribution of endogenous ena from the cell periphery to the mitochondria surface . we found that neither fp4-mito-gfp  nor xvasp-gfp  had an effect on the presence of eps8/abi1-induced actin stars. in addition, xvasp-gfp did not co-localize with the actin stars, indicating that ena/vasp proteins are not recruited to these actin structures .

eps <dig> recruits dsh to the membrane and actin filaments
previous studies have reported that eps <dig> can bind the wnt signaling protein dsh  <cit> , which is required for the transduction of both canonical and non-canonical wnt signals  <cit> . since dsh is required for cell polarization and convergent extension movements during gastrulation  <cit> , we hypothesized that the formation of an eps8/dsh complex may be important for regulating dsh localization and function during gastrulation. to test this idea, we asked whether eps <dig> interacts with dsh in animal cap cells. when expressed alone, dsh-gfp displays a punctate cytoplasmic distribution in animal cap explants   <cit> . expression of eps <dig> caused a dramatic redistribution of dsh-gfp to the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic actin filaments where it co-localized with actin and eps <dig> . in superficial epithelial cells, dsh was recruited to cell-cell junctions  and in deep cells dsh was recruited to cytoplasmic actin cables  and the cell cortex . furthermore, we found that epitope-tagged forms of dsh, eps <dig>  and abi <dig> co-localize in animal cap cells  suggesting that they can form a tri-complex in vivo. these data provide evidence that eps <dig> interacts with and may regulate the distribution and/or function of dsh through recruitment of dsh to the membrane and actin filaments.

identification and developmental expression of xenopus eps8
eps <dig> can interact with dsh and is thought to play an important role in regulating actin remodeling in motile cells, raising the possibility that eps <dig> might be a key regulator of cell movements during gastrulation in vertebrate embryos. to begin to address the role of eps <dig> during embryonic development, we performed in silico analyses to identify the xenopus ortholog of eps <dig>  searches of the tigr  and ncbi  databases led to the identification of cdnas that encode xenopus eps <dig> . the predicted xeps <dig> protein shows a high degree of sequence identity with both mouse and human eps <dig> and contains the conserved ptb, sh <dig>  and c-terminal effector domains. the developmental expression of xeps <dig> transcripts was determined by rt-pcr. we found that xeps <dig> transcripts are provided maternally and are present throughout development . we also found that xeps <dig> is expressed in isolated dorsal and ventral marginal zone tissue of gastrula stage embryos and that levels of xeps <dig> are higher in dorsal marginal regions compared to ventral regions . finally, we probed blots of embryonic lysates with anti-xeps <dig> polyclonal antibodies and found that xeps <dig> protein appears as a doublet and is present in unfertilized eggs, gastrula, and neurula stage embryos . these analyses show that xeps <dig> is expressed at the relevant time and place to regulate cell movements during gastrulation.

to test the requirement for xeps <dig> during development, we utilized a morpholino  antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the 5'-untranslated region to specifically knockdown levels of xeps <dig> protein during development. we found that the xeps <dig> mo could specifically block the expression of a myc-tagged version of xeps <dig>  but injection of the xeps <dig> mo into 4-cell stage embryos resulted in embryos with no apparent phenotype . the lack of a knockdown phenotype is not surprising since eps8-/- mice also displayed no obvious phenotype  <cit> . since eps <dig> is a member of a multi-gene family, we searched tigr and ncbi databases for additional xenopus eps <dig> genes and found evidence for a second xeps <dig> gene as well as three xeps8-like genes. therefore, the lack of a phenotype in xeps <dig> knockdown embryos is likely due to the expression of multiple xeps <dig> family members, including xeps8l <dig>  xeps8l <dig>  and xeps8l <dig>  during early development . thus, assessing the role of eps <dig> proteins in xenopus will require novel knockdown techniques capable of simultaneously and specifically inhibiting the activity of multiple gene products during early development.

expression of eps <dig> disrupts cell movements during gastrulation
since knockdown experiments produced negative results, we performed mis-expression experiments to test whether altering eps <dig> activity would affect cell movements during gastrulation. synthetic mrna encoding mouse eps8-myc or gfp as a control was injected into the equatorial region of both dorsal blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and resulting embryos were then examined for developmental abnormalities. defects in eps8-injected embryos were first apparent at stage  <dig>  . at this stage, control embryos formed a well-defined dorsal lip indicative of the onset of gastrulation movements and involution of dorsal mesoderm. in contrast, eps8-injected embryos showed a delay in the formation of the dorsal lip and when observed, the lip was disorganized . by stage  <dig>  eps8-injected embryos displayed a severe delay in blastopore closure and buckling of tissue above the blastopore . eps8-injected embryos eventually complete gastrulation and tadpoles displayed a phenotype including a shortened and arched anterior-posterior axis and head defects . the defects caused by eps <dig> are dose dependent; low doses  of eps <dig> result in cyclopia and a shortened a-p axis, moderate doses  show varying degrees of cyclopia, microcephaly, and shortening and arching of the a-p axis, and high doses  result in varying degrees of anencephaly, shortening and arching of the a-p axis, and spina bifida. control, gfp-injected embryos appeared normal at all stages examined . these data are consistent with the idea that eps8-induced actin re-organization leads to defects in cell movements during gastrulation in xenopus.

the gross morphological defects caused by dorsal expression of eps <dig> could be the result of defects in convergent extension or inhibition of mesoderm development, both of which would give superficially similar phenotypes. in order to distinguish between these two possibilities we performed histological analysis on injected embryos . histological sections of eps8-injected embryos demonstrated that notochord, somites, and neural tissue are all present, showing that expression of eps <dig> does not globally perturb specification of mesodermal or neural cell fates. instead, expression of eps <dig> resulted in broadening of the notochord along the mediolateral axis and morphological defects in the neural tube and somites. the widening of the notochord is consistent with the idea that expression of eps <dig> impairs convergent extension movements of the axial mesoderm.

analysis of activin-induced elongation of animal cap explants provides a powerful assay for studying the cell movements associated with gastrulation  <cit> . in these experiments, the animal pole region of an embryo is removed at the blastula stage and placed in culture. untreated animal cap explants and caps expressing eps <dig> differentiate into atypical epidermis and remain rounded  whereas addition of recombinant activin induces mesodermal differentiation, convergent extension movements, and elongation of uninjected explants . we found that expression of eps <dig> inhibits activin-induced elongation of animal cap explants . the failure of activin-induced animal caps to elongate was not caused by a block in mesoderm induction since both xbra  and xmyod  were expressed in control and eps8-injected animal caps following activin treatment .

discussion
here, we have investigated how eps <dig> regulates actin filament architecture and how this activity impacts cell movements during gastrulation. our results, together with previous studies, provide evidence that eps <dig> plays multiple roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and that these functions are influenced by the participation of eps <dig> in multi-protein actin regulatory complexes.

based on in vitro studies, eps <dig> is hypothesized to promote capping of actin barbed-ends in an abi1-dependent manner  <cit> . our findings suggest that in addition to its proposed role as a barbed end capping protein, eps <dig> might play additional roles in regulating actin organization in vivo. this idea is supported by the observation that eps <dig> expression resulted in enhanced formation of actin-rich filopodia-like structures in cultured cells and enhanced formation of actin bundles and accumulation of actin at cell-cell junctions in xenopus embryos. the presence of the filopodia-like structures on the dorsal surface of cells suggests that they are protrusive in nature and do not represent retraction structures, which are typically associated with sites of cell adhesion. additional studies examining the dynamics of these eps8-induced structures will help clarify the origin and nature of these structures. in addition, we found that abi <dig> modulated eps <dig> activity, promoting the formation of actin cables in cultured cells and actin stars in xenopus, suggesting that eps <dig> can regulate actin dynamics through abi1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. consistent with this idea, abi <dig> did not co-localize with eps <dig> at the tips of the filopodia-like structures in cultured cells suggesting that additional regulators of eps <dig> remain to be identified.

the correlation between eps <dig> expression and enhanced formation of filopodia-like structures and actin cables is consistent with the idea that eps <dig> may regulate actin filament elongation in vivo. regulation of barbed-end elongation and filopodia formation is thought to involve a balance between barbed-end capping and anti-capping activities. proteins such as cp are hypothesized to block elongation and favor formation of a dendritic network  <cit> , whereas proteins including ena/vasp proteins, which antagonize capping, are hypothesized to promote actin filament elongation and filopodia formation  <cit> . our work examining the regulation of eps <dig> activity by cp, n-wasp, and ena/vasp in xenopus yielded largely negative results, however, making it difficult to discern the relative contribution of eps <dig> capping activity versus other potential modes of activity in the regulation of actin architecture. further biochemical analyses will help elucidate the molecular mechanism by which eps <dig> regulates actin dynamics in vivo.

previous work  <cit>  and our results show that the ability of eps <dig> to modulate actin organization is regulated by its interaction with distinct binding partners such as abi <dig>  we found that abi <dig> can modulate eps <dig> activity in cultured cells and xenopus embryos. abi <dig> binds to the sh <dig> domain of eps <dig>  <cit>  and it has been proposed that this binding may alter the conformation or activity of the adjacent actin-binding domain of eps <dig>  <cit> . the mechanism by which abi <dig> might regulate eps <dig> activity remains unclear, but may involve recruitment of additional regulatory factors such as dsh, sos <dig>  and rac to the eps8/abi <dig> complex  <cit> . in addition, our work shows that n-wasp is recruited to eps8/abi1-induced actin stars suggesting that the eps8/abi <dig> complex interacts either directly or indirectly with actin nucleating factors. this idea is supported by the observation that eps <dig> can facilitate actin-based motility of n-wasp-coated beads in vitro in the presence of arp2/ <dig>  adf/cofilin, and profilin  <cit> . further studies will be required to examine how abi <dig> modulates eps <dig> activity and how eps <dig> works with abi <dig> and other regulatory factors to control actin organization in vivo.

eps <dig> has been shown to bind dsh  <cit> , a component of the wnt signaling pathway that is required for transduction of canonical wnt/β-catenin and non-canonical signals  <cit> . here, we have shown that eps <dig> expression recruits dsh to actin filaments and the cell membrane in xenopus. these data are significant because the role of dsh in non-canonical wnt/polarity signaling is thought to be dependent on its localization to the membrane and its ability to affect cell polarity and migration through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . dsh activity during gastrulation is dependent on both rhoa and rac, and the formin homology protein daam <dig> is required for dsh-mediated activation of rhoa  <cit> . however, a link between dsh and rac has not been identified. the eps8/abi1/sos <dig> complex is required for growth factor stimulated activation of rac  <cit> , suggesting that eps <dig> might provide an important link between dsh, rac, and the actin cytoskeleton during development. consistent with this idea, expression of eps <dig> impaired cell movements during gastrulation and eps <dig>  abi <dig>  and dsh co-localize in xenopus suggesting that these proteins can form a tri-complex in vivo. interestingly, we did not observe an effect of eps <dig> on dsh-mediated induction of wnt/β-catenin target genes  indicating that eps <dig> does not participate in canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling. unfortunately, our attempts to analyze the requirement for eps <dig> in xenopus were unsuccessful due to the expression of multiple eps <dig> family members during early development. thus, additional studies are necessary to determine the potential role of eps <dig> in the transduction of non-canonical wnt signals and the potential role of eps <dig> family members during gastrulation in vertebrates.

CONCLUSIONS
how might eps <dig> regulate the actin cytoskeleton in vivo? our findings together with data from previous studies support the idea that eps <dig> might regulate actin architecture in multiple ways. eps <dig> can bind to both barbed ends and the sides of actin filaments  <cit>  and it is possible that these different modes of actin binding mediate distinct effects on actin architecture in cells. barbed-end capping activity might regulate actin filament dynamics and stabilize existing filaments whereas an alternative activity might promote the formation and maintenance of actin arrays required for protrusive force generation and cellular structures such as microvilli and filopodia. this idea is consistent with our observation that eps <dig> is enriched at the tips of filopodia-like structures and localizes along the length of the filopodia-like structures and actin cables. this model is also in agreement with the observation that eps <dig> localizes to microvilli in the intestinal epithelium of c. elegans and knockdown of eps <dig> is associated with defects in microvilli formation  <cit> . the formation of actin cables in cells expressing eps <dig> and abi <dig> and actin clusters in xenopus embryos suggests that abi <dig> is a critical modulator of eps8's activity as an actin regulatory protein. the finding that eps <dig> expression impairs cell movements during gastrulation provides further support for this view and underscores the idea that the proper balance of actin assembly, disassembly, and organization is essential for controlling morphogenetic movements during development. thus, eps <dig> has emerged as a critical regulator of actin filament dynamics and further analysis of eps <dig> and its binding partners will help shed light on the mechanisms that mediate actin-based motility in vivo.
