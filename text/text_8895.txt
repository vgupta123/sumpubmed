BACKGROUND
chloroplasts, together with mitochondria, are the major energy producers in all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. the endosymbiotic theory proposes a prokaryotic origin for plastids and mitochondria. during the endosymbiotic process a host cell engulfed distinct ancestral bacteria. part of the genomes of these endosymbiotic bacteria have been kept and, as a result, plastids and mitochondria are the only organelles in the cell containing their own genome. however, while the chloroplast genome is composed of about  <dig> genes, its proteome is estimated to consist of about  <dig> proteins  <cit> . the development of highly specific organellar transport mechanisms was thus the response to the necessity for re-importing the gene products and to guarantee an optimal communication between cells and organelles.

the general import pathway in chloroplasts involves the cooperation of two heteroligomeric complexes in the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts, namely the toc complex–composed of toc <dig>  toc <dig>  toc <dig>  toc <dig> and toc <dig> subunits–and the tic complex–made up of tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> subunits–respectively  <cit> . for a proper import activity, several chaperones in the cytosol , intermembrane space  and stroma  are functionally coordinated during different stages of the transport process  <cit> .

unlike the different protein transport systems in thylakoids, the protein import machinery in the outer/inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts does not show obvious homology to any bacterial secretion system  <cit> . this is hardly surprising since the bacterial systems were required for thylakoids and therefore a new transport machinery had to be developed in the host cell to maintain the specificity for chloroplast communication. however, sequence analyses indicated that certain components of the translocons in chloroplasts are of bacterial origin. besides, there is a parallelism in the chaperone system required in some transport stages  <cit> . the translocation channel in the outer envelope membrane, toc <dig>  is related to outer membrane proteins involved in the transport or integration of proteins in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . tic <dig>  which is discussed to constitute part of the protein-conducting channel, shares sequence similarities to bacterial amino acid transporters  <cit> . other subunits might have been recruited and adapted as they show homology to bacterial proteins not related to transport processes. tic <dig>  which is thought to mediate the interaction of the toc and tic complexes during import, has cyanobacterial counterparts with unknown function and is proposed to be localized in the thylakoid lumen  <cit> . some cyanobacterial proteins contain cofactor-binding motifs similar to those found in tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig>  tic <dig> contains a rieske iron-sulphur centre and a mononuclear iron-binding site  <cit> , and tic <dig> and tic <dig> each have a nad-binding motif  <cit> . no prokaryotic counterparts have been detected by direct sequence comparison for the other subunits that compose the translocons, which may indicate that they have evolved from the proteome of the ancestral host to fulfil specific functions demanded after the development of plastids and to ensure the specificity of the transport process in the outer/inner envelope membranes of chloroplasts.

genome-wide analyses had shown that some subunits of the translocons  are encoded by more than one gene in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . experimental data derived from analyses of the isoforms of the toc complex revealed that the different members associate with structurally and developmentally distinct import complexes. four homologues compose the toc <dig> family in arabidopsis thaliana . the gene encoding the functional orthologue of toc <dig> from pisum sativum, attoc75-iii, is essential for the viability of plants from the embryonic stage. this is not the case for attoc75-iv, which could play a role during growth in the dark. it seems that attoc75-i is in fact a pseudogene  <cit> . the function and relation with the toc machinery of attoc75-v is still a matter of intensive study. in the case of toc <dig> and toc <dig> families, two  and four  isoforms are identified in the arabidopsis genome, respectively. whereas attoc <dig> associates preferably with attoc <dig>  attoc <dig> does with attoc132/attoc <dig> and this association is likely related to the import of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic precursors, respectively  <cit> . four homologues are identified for tic <dig> in arabidopsis and only two of them contain a predicted transit peptide. however, the function and subcellular localization of the two tic <dig> homologues with non-predicted transit peptide are still unknown  <cit> .

in spite of the wealth of information about the toc complex, less is known about phylogenetic relationships of the tic complex subunits. here we take a closer look at the structure, function and evolution of one component of the tic complex, tic <dig>  the n-terminal module of tic <dig> has a conserved nad-binding site and its c-terminal region was found to interact with ferredoxin-nad-oxido-reductase   <cit> . homology searches and phylogenetic analyses show that the n-terminal domain is highly conserved among all oxyphototrophs and green sulphur bacteria. however, the c-terminal region  is only found in vascular plants. phylogenetic analyses indicate that there are four groups of tic62-nad-related proteins in land plants. the first group is orthologous to the reported tic <dig> from pea  <cit> . the physiological roles of the tic62-nad-related proteins in the cell remain to be shown.

RESULTS
tic <dig>  a protein of  <dig> kda that is part of the tic complex, has been proposed to function as a sensor protein whose possible role is to regulate protein import into chloroplasts by sensing and reacting to the redox state of the organelle. so far the only tic <dig> protein studied is that from pisum sativum  <cit> . this protein was found to have two functional modules: the n-terminus was shown to bind pyridine nucleotides and the c-terminal region interacts with fnr. the fnr-binding module consists of a repetitive, highly conserved kppssp motif. one or two transmembrane helices were proposed for the pea sequence and both the n- and the c-terminus seem to face the stroma  <cit> .

excluding the transit peptide, pstic <dig> consists of  <dig> residues. the blast search against the protein databases with pstic <dig>  as a template resulted in several sequences from which just two correspond to the full-length form of the mature pstic62: one from arabidopsis thaliana  and another from oryza sativa . all the other hits, which showed recognizable sequence similarity to the n-terminal nad-binding domain of tic <dig>  lack the c-terminal module  responsible for the fnr binding and represent a short version of the tic <dig> protein. a search of the fnr-binding motif over dbest revealed its presence exclusively in vascular plant organisms  .

interestingly, all the proteins homologous to the nad-binding part of tic <dig> were from photosynthetic organisms . a multiple sequence alignment of these proteins is shown in figure  <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was built based on the alignment . both the multiple alignment and the phylogenetic tree indicate that the tic62-nad-related protein family is made up of four well-supported clusters  that have been divided into six groups. these groups are schematically represented in figure  <dig> and are described below. the four plant subfamilies are classified according to the genbank accession number of the arabidopsis protein found within each group .

 group i: np_ <dig> . this subfamily contains the original tic <dig> sequence from pea and makes up the tic <dig> family, even though not all the members of this family have a molecular weight of  <dig> kda and the association with the tic machinery remains to be shown . it is composed of proteins from chloroplast-containing organisms of land plants and red algae. so far no sequence of this subfamily was found in green algae , in the diatom thalassiosira or in any oxyphotobacteria. because a final annotation of the green algae genomes is still in progress, a final confirmation of the absence of the protein of group i in green algae is pending. this group is characterized by the motif e-r-p/a-t-d-x-ar-k/g-e-t-h , where ar represents an aromatic residue. surprisingly, only the sequences from vascular plants within this group show the full-length version of the tic <dig> protein and contain the fnr-binding motif at the c-terminus. a minor distinction between tic <dig> from arabidopsis and the other full-length sequences is the number of four or three repetitive modules, respectively . exhaustive searches for the fnr-interacting repeat in the physcomitrella patens genome revealed no hits to these regions. 3'race pcrs of the detected physcomitrella tic <dig> gene were performed to determine its c-terminal sequence. it resulted exclusively in the short form of the gene, giving a stop codon in position  <dig>  additionally, immunodecoration with the pea tic <dig> antibody, raised against the c-terminal part of the protein , showed no signal in physcomitrella chloroplasts . finally, an insertion of 6– <dig> residues  is found in vascular plants and red algae. the search of this motif in the physcomitrella genome resulted in no hits. the overall identity of the sequences composing this subfamily is 40%. all of them contain a transit peptide for targeting the protein to chloroplasts, and they might be localized at the inner envelope membrane as it was previously reported for the pea sequence  <cit> , though the fnr-binding domain could modulate the subcellular localization of the protein by the interaction with fnr and/or other proteins.

 group ii: np_ <dig> . the members of this subfamily are homologous to the short version of the tic <dig> protein from vascular plants. this subfamily is composed of proteins from the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and both non-vascular and vascular plants . surprisingly, there is no sign of the presence of members of this group in red algae genomes . this group is closely related to group i and the phylogenetic tree is highly consistent in splitting up these two groups . the green plant sequences of this group are characterized by the motif l-v-n-g-a-a-p-g-q-x-n-p-a-y, where p represents a polar residue . the proteins from green plants contain an n-terminal extension, which is predicted to act as a transit peptide to target the proteins to chloroplasts. recently, the arabidopsis protein has been identified in a proteomic analysis of isolated plastoglobules  <cit> .

 group iii. this cyanobacterial subfamily is composed of proteins from a variety of organisms such as synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  the small-genome cyanobacteria prochlorococcus marinus  or the heterocystous cyanobacteria nostoc sp. this group comes together with groups i and ii in a well-supported cluster  and the phylogenetic trees were highly consistent in outgrouping the sequence from gloeobacter violaceus , a cyanobacterial member of an early branching lineage  <cit> . due to the annotation in the databases of the synechocystis sequence from this family  as ycf <dig> gene product, a connection between tic <dig> and ycf <dig> was previously proposed  <cit> . however, it can be traced that the original ycf <dig> gene product is not related to sll <dig> but to slr <dig> in synechocystis   <cit> . both cyanobacterial proteins share 26% identity and 42% similarity. the ycf <dig> gene product  was found to act as a chaperone for quinone binding  <cit> . this cyanobacterial protein is similar to the np_195251arabidopsis sequence that is not a tic62-nad-related protein. therefore, it can be argued that a connection between tic <dig> and ycf <dig> may be an artefact originated by a non-reliable annotation in the protein database.

 group iv, np_ <dig> . this group is made up of proteins from green plants and, interestingly, only unicellular and filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria. the members of this family also represent short versions of the tic <dig> protein. so far no sequences from red algae were found. this group is characterized by the motif g-p-y-t-s-y-d-l-n-t-l-l-k/q-a-t/k-a/s/t . the land plant sequences contain a predicted chloroplast transit peptide and proteomics studies have localized the protein from arabidopsis in chloroplasts  <cit> . the lack of homologous sequences in other cyanobacteria such as synechocystis or prochlorococcus may be in accordance with a previously reported work, which showed that nostoc proteins have higher similarity to arabidopsis nuclear-encoded proteins than proteins from prochlorococcus or synechocystis  <cit> .

 group v, np_ <dig> . this family consists of proteins exclusively from eukaryotic phototrophs, which show homology to the short version of tic <dig>  the sequences of the land plant members of this group are characterized by the motif t-s-a-v-p-k-m-k-p-g-f-d-p-s/t-k-g-g-r-p-e-f-h, where h represents a hydrophobic residue . two different subgroups of sequences within this subfamily in land plants were identified, which are differentiated by the presence of a predicted transit peptide. this may suggest a dual localization in the cell for the members of this group. the first subgroup comprises land plant proteins without a predicted transit peptide. these proteins are  ,   and  from arabidopsis, rice and physcomitrella, respectively. the second subgroup is composed of sequences that contain a predicted transit peptide for chloroplasts:  ,   and  from arabidopsis, rice and physcomitrella, respectively. at2g <dig> has been found in chloroplasts by proteomics analyses  <cit> . in spite of a possible difference in localization, the two subgroups are highly similar  which suggests a similar function in the cell. only incomplete sequences were found in the algae genomes analysed  and, therefore, no further conclusions can be made for these organisms.

the structure of the np_568098arabidopsis protein bound to nadp has been recently solved at  <dig>  Å resolution by x-ray crystallography . the residues involved in the binding to the cofactor are marked with a triangle in the multiple sequence alignment .

 group vi. the last group to be mentioned corresponds to proteins of green sulphur bacteria . two subgroups are recognized, which likely originated from a gene duplication event . the similarity search using pstic <dig> as a template retrieved sequences from green sulphur bacteria with homology to the short version of tic <dig>  these are anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria that contain a type-i  reaction centre. a reverse blast search, using the green sulphur tic62-related sequences, did not retrieve any sequences from oxyphotosynthetic organisms different from the groups mentioned above. although very different organisms, the genome comparison between green sulphur bacteria and oxyphotosynthetic organisms showed that many components of photosynthesis and energy metabolism are highly similar. green sulphur bacteria, cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phototrophs are the only organisms that synthesize chlorophyll a and also directly reduce pyridine nucleotides <cit> .

the presence of so many proteins in chloroplasts related to the nad-binding domain of tic <dig> deserves a detailed study. the function of the n-terminal module seems important for the viability of the photosynthetic organisms since the gene has been conserved in all the genomes. all the proteins are predicted to bind pyridine nucleotides and are referred here as tic62-nad-related family due to the similarity to the nad-binding domain of pstic <dig>  the tic62-nad-related family is of ancient origin, as proteins were not only found in ancient cyanobacteria  but also in green sulphur bacteria. this might propose that a tic62-nad-related protein was already present in the ancestor who evolved to green sulphur bacteria and cyanobacteria. the presence of two genes in nostoc punctiforme  might suggest that a gene duplication event occurred prior to the evolution of cyanobacteria . some cyanobacterial organisms could have lost one of the genes, which could explain its absence in gloeobacter, prochlorococcus and synechocystis in group iv. two highly supported groups  together with group iii comprise a big cluster of sequences and groups i and ii are possibly derived from group iii which contains the majority of the cyanobacterial proteins. a four-cluster likelihood-mapping analysis  showed that branching order – was favoured in more than 90% of  <dig>  puzzling, and demonstrated that group v is closely related to group iv. the presence of paralogues in land plants of group v could be due to a gene duplication event within the eukaryotic organism.

most of the tic62-nad-related proteins in higher plants are found in chloroplasts, but only the specific localization of pstic <dig>  at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts and np_ <dig>  in plastoglobules have been shown experimentally  <cit> . it would be worth investigating the subcellular localization of the other members of the family and, especially, to analyse the possible dual localization of the proteins belonging to group v. the lack of a transit peptide had also been described in two homologues that compose the tic <dig> family in arabidopsis  <cit> . a possible localization outside plastids could be another example of a protein of cyanobacterial origin that has been redirected to a compartment different from plastids  <cit> . however, the targeting information to chloroplasts could be different from the canonical transit peptide  <cit>  and a localization of such proteins in chloroplasts cannot be excluded. the presence of members of the family at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts, involved in the import process, and in plastoglobules, structures that act as a functional metabolic link between the inner envelope and thylakoid membranes, points to an important role of the protein family in metabolism.

the resolution of the structure of a protein is a major step in understanding the function. since the similarity among sequences in the tic62-nad-related family is sufficiently high, the knowledge of the structure of one member of tic62-related family permits to draw general conclusions about the structure of other members. the crystallized np_ <dig> protein shows the typical nadph-rossman fold. figure  <dig> also represents the secondary structure of the crystallized np_ <dig> protein. clearly, most of the insertions and deletions of the proteins in this family correspond to loops in the crystal structure and most of the motifs related to α- and β-conformations are highly conserved. therefore, the nadph-rossman fold is also expected for the core structure of all members of the tic62-nad-related family, with differences mainly in the loop regions. the glycine-motif in the coenzyme-binding region is fully conserved in the whole family  and it may be related to the extended short-chain dehydrogenase-reductase superfamily  <cit> . the highly conserved aspartic acid residue required for stabilization of the adenine-binding pocket is found in the loop between β <dig> and α <dig>  except for group vi  <cit> . however, large differences are expected in the regions of the β <dig> and β <dig> strands. in the crystal structure, these two β-strands form an antiparallel β-sheet, which connect a long loop . the differences in this region among the subfamilies could be correlated to the specific function of each subfamily. since the protein was crystallized in the presence of nadp, the residues involved in the binding to the cofactor were identified . these residues are marked in figure  <dig>  from the multiple sequence alignment it can be concluded that many residues that bind to nadp are highly conserved within the family . specifically, the conservation of the residues  involved in the nadp binding is high in members of group i . these residues are underlined above and they could represent the residues implicated in the nadp binding of tic <dig>  mutagenesis studies are necessary to establish the role of these residues clearly.

the mode of interaction of tic <dig> with the membrane/tic complex is unknown. previous experiments showed that likely hydrophobic contacts mediate the binding to the membrane/tic complex, as most of the protein remains within the membrane upon alkaline and urea treatments  <cit> . tmhmm  <cit>  and predictprotein  <cit>  algorithms do not predict any transmembrane helices in group i. moreover, protease digestion experiments showed that pstic <dig> is protected in inner envelope vesicles that, together with the hydrophilic profile of tic <dig>  suggest that the protein faces the stroma while attached to the membrane/tic complex. based on the identity  between attic <dig>  and np_ <dig> , a homology model procedure was followed to construct a model for the nadp-binding domain of the tic <dig> protein . figure 5a shows the sequence alignment of the n-terminal domain of the attic <dig> protein and the template based on the multiple sequence alignment of the tic62-nad-related family . the key residues involved in the pyridine ring binding are shown in red. the predicted secondary structure of attic <dig> is compared with the known secondary structure of the template. as can be seen, most of the conformational elements are conserved in both sequences. slight differences are the presence of β <dig> and β <dig> strands in the template , and two smalls α-helices predicted between β <dig> and β <dig> strands in attic <dig>  a model was built based on this alignment and it was structurally evaluated with whatcheck. the corresponding values were good: ramachandran plot, - <dig> ; backbone conformation, - <dig> ; chi-1/chi- <dig> rotamer normality, - <dig> ; bond lengths,  <dig> ; bond angles,  <dig> . only the values for the backbone conformation were poor, but this is probably due to gaps in the alignment and located in loop regions of the template . in fact, the structural analysis obtained by the verify3d program assigns positive values all over the structure, except in the regions lqntdegt and fpaailnlfwgvlc in attic <dig>  that support the previous proposal. the energetic parameter of the model was e = - <dig>  kj·mol- <dig>  in figure 5b, a view of the proposed structural model for at tic <dig>  superimposed to the template  is despicted. the nadp ligand is shown in red and the residues involved in the binding are underlined in figure 5a. it can be seen that the β <dig> and β <dig> elements connect a long loop that is missing in attic <dig> . interestingly, a large number of hydrophobic residues is concentrated in this region in attic <dig> . the model presented here for attic <dig> suggests that the hydrophobic region  might be responsible for attaching the protein to the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts or to the tic complex, and this region would establish differences in the localisation within cells between the two groups of proteins . by this way, tic <dig> would be attached to the membrane, without spanning it, exposing the two functional modules to the stromal side. the hydrophilic profile and the large number of conserved proline residues at the c-terminal domain make it a better candidate for protein-protein interactions rather than for insertion into the membrane  <cit> . these interactions might also contribute to the binding of tic <dig> to the membrane/tic complex.

focusing on group i, one of the questions to be answered is whether or not all members of this group are tic components. although they might share a common dehydrogenase activity at the n-terminus, the origin of the fnr-binding module at the c-terminus in vascular plants remains unknown and different functions might be expected among the different organisms. no similar sequences to the c-terminus of pstic <dig> were found in the databases with significant homology, which could indicate that either the fnr-binding module was lost during evolution and only kept in vascular plants, or  the fnr-binding module was recently acquired by vascular plants. the high similarity of the nadp-binding domain of the physcomitrella sequence in group i with pstic <dig>  suggests that the short version of tic <dig> in physcomitrella, together with tic110/tic55/tic40/tic32/tic22/tic <dig>  <cit> , might be a constituent of the tic complex. the same might be true for cyanidioschyzon merolae. on the other hand, it cannot be excluded that the concurrence of both n-t and c-t domains, or even the fnr-binding domain alone, were compulsory to settle a protein as a tic component. further studies are necessary to establish the mode of interaction of tic <dig> with the tic complex in vascular plants and to elucidate the localization and function of members of group i in non-vascular plants.

still the question remains of the presence and function of fnr at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. in chloroplasts, this protein is found either soluble in the stroma in a non-functional state or attached to the thylakoids, where the protein is involved in the last stage of the electron transport process in photosynthesis. fnr is a ubiquitous flavoenzyme whose function is not exclusively confined to photosynthesis  <cit>  and, recently, the protein has also been found to be localized at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts  <cit> . when attached to the thylakoids, a reductase-binding protein  mediates the binding to the membrane  <cit> . in line with this, one possibility could be that fnr is attached to the inner envelope membrane via the fnr-binding motif of tic <dig>  this interaction in vascular plants could be affected by the activity of tic <dig> that could specifically regulate the–yet unknown–functional state of fnr in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. the opposite effect cannot be excluded, and the binding of fnr could regulate the activity of tic <dig>  and therefore the transport machinery. this regulation upon binding could depend on the redox state of chloroplasts and might involve nadp/nad or a low potential electron donor and another substrate not yet identified  <cit> . on the other hand, a possible electron transfer process between fnr and tic <dig> cannot be excluded although the capacity of tic <dig> as electron acceptor/donor has not yet been proven. it is likely that the fnr-binding domain is important for some kind of metabolic regulation just in vascular plants, which needs further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the reported results show that the n-terminal module of tic <dig> -binding domain) is highly conserved among all oxyphototrophs. the tic62-nad-related sequences are of ancient origin, since the protein was not only found in cyanobacteria but also in green-sulfur bacteria. this protein family would belong to the extended family of short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases and likely contains the structurally conserved rossman fold. on the other hand, the c-terminal module in tic <dig>  is only found in vascular plants. this domain is enriched in proline amino acids and it would be important for protein-protein interactions that might regulate the function of tic <dig> protein. tic <dig> proteins in vascular plants would be attached to the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts, without spanning it, exposing both c-terminal and n-terminal domains to the stroma. further studies are necessary to establish the mode of interaction of tic <dig> with the tic complex in vascular plants and to elucidate the localization and function of related members in non-vascular plants
