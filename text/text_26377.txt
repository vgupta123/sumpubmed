BACKGROUND
over the past two decades, we have witnessed the publication of more than  <dig>  complete microbial genome sequences . the trend towards genome sequencing is expected to continue or even accelerate in the near future. the wealth of sequence information has greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial physiology and biological processes underlying the very organization of life. one of the major tasks of the post-genomic era is "reading" genomic sequences in order to extract all the biological information contained in them. an essential step in this quest is the identification of protein-coding genes, with subsequent functional annotation of the corresponding gene products  <cit> . a number of gene-finding methods have been developed to address this problem from different points of view. generally, these gene-finding methods are divided into two broad categories  <cit> . "extrinsic" methods take into account information derived from similarity search procedures  <cit> . "intrinsic" methods, which deal with dna sequence only, use statistic or pattern recognition algorithms to find genes in dna through detection of specific motifs or global statistical patterns. for example, genemark employs a hidden markov model  to find genes  <cit>  while glimmer employs an interpolated markov model  <cit> . although a wide variety of techniques is used to solve the gene finding problem and a number of prokaryotic gene-finding software are available, gene recognition in bacteria is far from being always straightforward and there are still a lot of wrong or inaccurately annotated genes and missing genes in the published genomes  <cit> . a major reason for this situation may be that genes can be tightly packed in prokaryotes, resulting in frequent overlap. thus, detection of translation initiation sites and/or selection of the correct coding regions remain difficult  <cit> . in addition, it is now well known that all microbial genomes contain an abundance of short genes  <cit> . for statistical reasons, the longer the sequences, the easier it is to detect the codon bias. the short length of these genes probably affects both pillars of cds prediction, namely intrinsic and extrinsic approaches  <cit> .

the xanthomonas genus is one of the most ubiquitous groups of plant-associated bacterial pathogens. members of this genus have been shown to infect at least  <dig> monocotyledonous and  <dig> dicotyledonous plant species  <cit> . xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  dowson  is the causal agent of black rot of crucifers, which is possibly the most important disease of crucifers worldwide  <cit> . so far, genomes of the three xcc strains atcc  <dig>   <dig>  and b <dig> have been sequenced  <cit> . the genome of xcc strain atcc <dig> comprises a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp encoding a total of  <dig> predicted cdss  <cit> . the genome of xcc strain  <dig> resides on a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp, which encodes  <dig> predicted cdss  <cit> . although the majority of the genes encoded by the two genomes were identical, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cdss unique to xcc  <dig> and xcc atcc <dig> were respectively identified  <cit> . in particular, analysis of the genome of xcc strain  <dig> identified a total of  <dig> cdss that have homologs in xcc atcc <dig>  but were not annotated by da silva et al.  <cit> . similarly, annotation of the recent sequenced genome of xcc b <dig> identified more than  <dig> additional cdss that were not annotated in the other two xcc strains  <cit> . although these newly identified cdss need to be further verified, the findings suggest that there is still room for improvement in the state of gene identification of xcc genomes.

in this study, putative protein coding sequences in the two genomes of the xcc strains  <dig> and atcc <dig> were re-predicted using the latest version of three gene-prediction programs. a total of additional  <dig> putative new cdss were identified. based on the results of similarity searching, transcriptional pattern analysis and functional analysis, a reliable list of  <dig> new cdss was obtained from this data set. the function of two newly identified genes was further confirmed by gene deletion and subsequent phenotype analysis.

RESULTS
cds re-prediction and identification of putative new cdss
in this study, by using a combined strategy  that the three well-established gene finders glimmer   <cit> , genemark  <cit> , and zcurve  <cit>  were respectively applied to predict putative protein coding sequences  within the two genomes of xcc strains  <dig> and atcc <dig>  <cit> , a total of  <dig> cdss were identified after further sequence analaysis . among them,  <dig>  cdss, including  <dig> xcc strain 8004-specific cdss,  <dig> atcc33913-specific cdss and  <dig> shared cdss between the two genomes, have been previously annotated . the remaining  <dig> predicted cdss have not been identified in the published two genomes and were defined as putative new cdss , including  <dig> cdss by glimmer,  <dig> cdss by genemark, and  <dig> cdss by zcurve . intriguingly, there were only  <dig> overlapping cdss predicted by all the three gene finders . the size of these putative cdss ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bps, and most of them  were less than  <dig> kb long . in particular,  <dig> cdss were less than  <dig> bp in length. blastn analysis revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> putative new cdss were located at intergenic regions of both strands  in the chromosome of xcc strain  <dig> . the remaining  <dig> cdss were partially or fully overlapped with the annotated genes, but within different reading frames . all of  <dig> putative new cdss > <dig> bp in length were either antisense or overlapping to the annotated genes in two xcc genomes .

validation of new cds by extrinsic evidence
the set of  <dig> putative new cdss was probably contaminated by pseudogene fragments and false-prediction artifacts because all the  <dig> gene finders are entirely based on intrinsic evidence. to find true cds, the next strategy used in this study was to get support by extrinsic evidence. all the putative new cdss were blasted for similar entries within the ncbi non-redundent database by means of blastp. based on the three criteria described in materials and methods, a total of  <dig> putative new cdss were found to be significantly similar to other protein sequences in the database .

more recently, the genome sequence of xcc strain b <dig> has been published and the genome contained  <dig> additional cdss  <cit> . about half of the these cdss that were identified by the combined use of the gene finders gismo  <cit>  and reganor  <cit>  were also present in the genomes of xcc strains  <dig> and atcc <dig>  but have not been annotated  <cit> . comparing the  <dig> putative new cdss identified in this study with the  <dig> additional cdss in xcc strain b <dig>  we found an overlapping  <dig> cdss . among them,  <dig> cdss had more than one homologs in non-redundant database and have been included in the  <dig> putative new cdss identified by similarity searching; the remaining  <dig> cdss had no homologs in non-redundant database except in xcc strain b <dig> and were also regarded as new cdss in this study . taken together, a total of  <dig> cdss were screened out of  <dig> putative new cdss by extrinsic evidence.

the majority of these cdss  encodes conserved hypothetical proteins or hypothetical proteins . eleven cdss  encode putative secreted or exported proteins and three cdss encode regulatory protein or transcription factors . xcc_cds <dig> encodes a sir2-like transcriptional silencer protein; xcc_cds <dig> encodes an arsr family transcriptional regulator; xcc_cds <dig> bears similarity to the homeodomain of pou domain proteins or hth_xre domain proteins . two cdss  encode putative phenol hydroxylases and another  <dig> cdss  encode putative 50s ribosomal proteins. the remaining  <dig> cdss respectively encode peptidase-like protein , hemolysin iii , is480b transposase , putative cell wall surface anchor family protein , endonuclease , chloramphenicol o-acetyltransferase , outer protein d , abc transporter heme permease , putative gtpase , putative dna methylase , transmembrane protein , putative tryptophan-rich sensory protein , dihydroxydipicolinate synthase , thermoresistant gluconokinase , thiopurine methyltransferase , putative tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase oxidoreductase , putative atu protein , wd40-like beta propeller , ferric pseudobactins receptor protein , and restriction endonuclease  .

transcription analysis for new cds
an alternative approach to validate a cds is to detect the transcribed mrna. an oligonucleotide microarray chip, which contains 50-mer oligos specific for  <dig> annotated cdss and  <dig> negative controls, has been successfully used to analyze the dsf regulon, clp regulon and ravr regulon in xcc  <cit> . in this study, a new microarray chip with the above-mentioned oligos and additional oligos specific for the  <dig> putative new cdss was constructed. this microarray chip was used to detect transcripts of the putative new cdss. to detect transcripts under different conditions, total rna was extracted from cell culture grown under the following conditions:  different cell density: od <dig> =  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ;  different genetic backgrounds: Δrpff strain, Δrpfc, Δclp and Δravr  <cit> ;  different media: rich yeb medium and poor nyg medium. by using the screening procedures described in materials and methods,  <dig> putative new cdss were found with detectable transcripts . further analysis revealed that  <dig> cdss were constitutively expressed during the growth and the remaining  <dig> cdss were only expressed at high cell density  . comparing the global gene expression profiles of xcc wild type, rpff, rpfc, and clp deletion mutants, we found that the transcription of  <dig> high cell density-dependent cdss was also positively regulated by the quorum sensing signal dsf  <cit> . the expression levels of these cdss in an rpff deletion mutant were respectively  <dig>  to  <dig>  times lower than those in the wild type xc <dig> strain . the transcription of xcc_cds <dig> was only induced in poor nyg medium at higher density  .

in order to go further in the validation of our microarray-based method for selecting true cds, and as we are more interested in dsf signal-regulated cdss, we chose the  <dig> dsf signal-regulated cdss for further transcriptional analysis by reverse transcription pcr. the products of  <dig> cdss could be amplified by using total rnas extracted from cell culture at od <dig> =  <dig>  . the resultant rt-pcr products were further verified by sequencing analysis . rt-pcr analysis also verified the transcriptional difference of the  <dig> new cdss between wild type and rpff deletion mutant .

total new cdss identified by similarity searching and transcriptional analysis
while extrinsic evidence supported the presence of  <dig> new cdss, and while transcriptional analysis indicated  <dig> new cdss with detectable transcripts, a comparison of the two sets of new cdss revealed a total of  <dig> overlapping cdss that were identified by both approaches . thus, a total of  <dig>  cdss got support by extrinsic evidence or/and experimentally transcriptional analysis, suggesting that they are probably true cdss. the remaining  <dig> putative new cdss failed to get support by extrinsic evidence or transcriptional analysis . two of the overlapping  <dig> cdss, xcc_cds <dig> and xcc_cds <dig>  which both encoded putative transcription factors, were chosen for further experimental characterization. the results are presented in the following sections.

xcc_cds <dig> encodes a sir2-like domain protein and is associated with virulence on chinese cabbage
xcc_cds <dig> is a new cds of  <dig> bps in length. it encodes a protein with a conserved silent information regulator  <dig>  or sir2-like domain , which has been found to confer nad-dependent protein deacetylase activity in eukaryotes  <cit> . for the convenience of discussion, xcc_cds <dig> was renamed as sir2x for sir2-like protein gene in xanthomonas campestris in this study. the dna sequence of sir2x was found in all the  <dig> published xcc genomes and in xcc strain xc <dig> . in the genome of xcc strain  <dig>  sir2x is flanked by xc_ <dig> and xc_ <dig> , which respectively encode a phage-related regulatory protein cii and a hypothetical protein. sir2x and xc_ <dig> share the same transcriptional orientation and are separated by only one base pair . further rt-pcr analysis confirmed that sir2x and xc_ <dig> are transcribed as an operon . to further study its role in xcc, the coding region  of sir2x was in frame deleted in the chromosome of xcc strain xc <dig> and the resultant mutant was named as Δsir2x. deletion of sir2x did not affect the production of virulence factors, including extracellular protease, extracellular cellulase, and eps , but significantly reduced virulence of xcc strain xc <dig> on chinese cabbage . complementation of the mutant with the sir2x coding region resulted in the complete recovery of virulence to wild-type level .

xcc_cds <dig> is associated with arsenate resistance in xcc strain 8004
xcc_cds <dig> encodes a 122-aa protein with a conserved hth_arsr domain , which occurs in arsenical resistance operon repressors and similar prokaryotic, metal-regulated homodimeric repressors that belong to the arsr superfamily of bacterial transcription-regulatory proteins  <cit> . for the convenience of discussion, this cds was renamed as arsr. interestingly, arsr was only found in the genome of xcc strain  <dig>  not in xcc strains atcc <dig> and b <dig>  in the xcc  <dig> genome, arsr is located upstream of xc_ <dig> and xc_ <dig>  which respectively encode a putative high-affinity fe2+/pb2+ permease and an arsenite efflux pump acr <dig> . arsr and xc_ <dig> were separated by  <dig> bps and the gap between xc_ <dig> and xc_ <dig> was  <dig> bps . further rt-pcr analysis showed that arsr, xc_ <dig>  and xc_ <dig> belong to the same operon , suggesting that arsr, xc_ <dig> and xc_ <dig> might be functionally related. to further confirm this hypothesis, an arsr in frame deletion mutant termed Δarsr was generated in xcc strain  <dig>  the results showed that the Δarsr strain was much more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type strain . on lb plates with  <dig>  mm arsenate, the wild type strain xcc  <dig> grew well, while in contrast, the deletion mutant did not grow at all on this medium . the mutant phenotype could be reverted by complementation with a plasmid carrying the coding region of arsr, demonstrating that the observed phenotype was due to arsr.

discussion
in this study, we used a combined strategy for cds prediction. glimmer is a computational gene-finding system and the technical underpinning of the system is an interpolated markov model , a generalization of markov chain methods  <cit> . the genemark program is an ab initio gene finder, which employs inhomogeneous  markov chain models describing protein-coding dna and homogeneous markov chain models describing non-coding dna  <cit> . zcurve is a system for recognizing protein-coding genes in bacterial genome, which uses the "z-transformation" of dna as information source for classification  <cit> . the results showed that  <dig> % of the cdss  in the existing annotations of strain atcc <dig> and  <dig> % of the cdss  of strain  <dig> could be predicted by the combined strategy , suggesting that the combined gene finding strategy works well for finding currently annotated genes in xcc genomes. in addition to the cdss in the existing annotations of xcc genomes, a total of  <dig> putative new cdss were identified in the two xcc genomes by the combined gene prediction strategy. among them,  <dig> reliable new cdss were further confirmed by subsequent analysis based on extrinsic similarity or/and transcript detection, suggesting that the combined gene finding strategy could be used for finding new cds in bacterial genomes. considering the number of putative cdss predicted and those having been confirmed by extrinsic evidence and/or microarray analysis , glimmer seems more powerful than genemark and zcurve in new cds prediction.

microarrays traditionally have been used to analyze the expression behavior of large numbers of annotated genes in bacteria. in this study, microarray analysis, applied together with cds prediction, was used to find new genes, which was further validated by rt-pcr analysis. compared to other transcript detection methods, microarray analysis is more sensitive and suitable for highthroughput analysis. so far, a similar strategy has only been reported for escherichia coli. selinger et al.  <cit>  introduced a high-density oligonucleotide probe array for e. coli that not only carries strand-specific probes for all mrna, trna, and rrna regions, but also covers intergenic regions of > <dig> bp. using e. coli rna from cells grown on different media, over  <dig> transcripts corresponding to intergenic regions were identified. further classification revealed  <dig> novel transcripts with unknown function  <cit> .

sir <dig> proteins are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans  <cit> . in eukaryotes, sir <dig> proteins regulate transcriptional repression, recombination, the cell division cycle, microtubule organization, cellular responses to dna-damaging agents and aging  <cit> . a phylogenetically conserved nad+-dependent protein deacetylase activity has been demonstrated in sir <dig> family proteins in eukaryotes  <cit> . so far very limited evidence is available regarding the function of sir- <dig> proteins in bacteria. the only reported case was from salmonella typhimurium, where the gene cobb is involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin and the catabolism of propionate  <cit> . further analysis revealed that the recombinant sir <dig> protein cobb had nad-dependent adp-ribosyltransferase activity in vitro  <cit> . the demonstration that the ribosyltransferase and nad+-dependent protein deacetylase activities are both dependent on an acetylated substrate confirms the fundamental link between the two activities  <cit> . the true enzymatic activity of sir2x and how sir2x is involved in the regulation of virulence in chinese cabbage remains to be dissolved. the involvement of sir2x in virulence of xcc strain xc <dig> is in good agreement with previous findings that transposon insertion in the promoter region of xc <dig> encoding a phage-related regulatory protein cii led to a complete loss of virulence of xcc strain  <dig> on radish  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  xc <dig> and the newly identified sir2x are within the same operon and they share a common promoter. transposon insertion in the promoter region probably disrupts not only the expression of xc <dig>  but also the expression of sir2x. the roles of sir2x in xcc virulence remains to be dissolved.

arsenic, a toxic metalloid, is currently and has always been ranked first on the superfund list of hazardous substances , in part because of its environmental ubiquity. as a consequence, many bacterial species have genes that confer resistance to arsenic. environmental arsenic is sensed by members of the arsr/smtb family of metalloregulatory transcriptional repressors  <cit> , which represses the expression of operons involved in the uptake, efflux, sequestration, or detoxification of metal ions  <cit> . this study identified an arsr family repressor and found that the xc2294-xc2295-arsr operon is involved in arsenate resistance in xcc strain  <dig>  since no arsr homologs were found in xcc strains atcc <dig>  b <dig> and xc <dig>  we propose that the arsr may have been acquired by xcc strain  <dig> in a lateral gene transfer event.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reported a thorough search for new cds in the two published xcc genomes. in the first, putative cdss encoded in the two genomes were re-predicted using three gene finders, resulting in the identification of  <dig> putative new cdss. in the second, similarity searching was conducted and  <dig> cdss were found to have homologs in other bacterial species. in the third, oligonucleotide microarray and rt-pcr analysis identified  <dig> cdss with detectable mrna transcripts. finally, in-frame deletion and subsequent phenotype analysis of the two newly identified cdss confirmed their functionality. our results showed that, despite sophisticated approaches available for genome annotation, many cellular transcripts have remained unidentified so far in xcc genomes. through a combined strategy involving bioinformatic, postgenomic and genetic approaches as demonstrated in this study, a reliable list of  <dig> new cdss was identified and a more thorough understanding of some cellular processes was gained.
