BACKGROUND
citrate, a ubiquitous natural compound that exists in all living cells, can be used by several enterobacterial species as a carbon and energy source. klebsiella pneumoniae has been known to be able to grow anaerobically with citrate as the sole carbon source. during the past decade, the physiology, biochemistry, and regulation of this pathway have been extensively studied in k. pneumoniae  <cit> . the fermentation process involves uptake of citrate by a na+ -dependent citrate carrier, cleavage into oxaloacetate and acetate by citrate lyase, and decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to pyruvate by oxaloacetate decarboxylase. finally, pyruvate can be converted to acetate, formate and carbon dioxide by means of anaerobic pyruvate catabolism.

genes responsible for citrate fermentation of k. pneumoniae can be identified in a 13-kb gene cluster on the chromosome . these genes are contained within two divergently transcribed operons, citc2d2e2f2g <dig> and cits-oadgab-citab  <cit> . the citc2d2e2f2g <dig> operon encodes the citrate lyase ligase, the γ-, β-, and α-subunits of citrate lyase, and triphosphoribosyl-dephospho-coenzyme a synthase. the cits-oadgab-citab operon encodes the citrate carrier cits, the γ-, α-, and β-subunits of oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and the citrate-sensing cita-citb two component system  <cit> . transcription at the promoters in front of the two operons is activated by phospho-citb and crp-camp  <cit> . additionally, citx, which is required for synthesis of the citrate lyase prosthetic group, has been identified in a second genomic location along with citw, a putative citrate transporter gene, and cityz that encodes a two component system homologous to cita-citb  <cit> . the citwx genes and the divergent cityz are adjacent but placed in opposite directions.

coliform organisms, especially e. coli and k. pneumoniae, are the most common causes of urinary tract infection. uropathogenic pathogens have been studied extensively for virulence factors such as the fimbriae and adhesins  <cit> . these virulence factors facilitate the anchorage of the pathogens to the extracellular matrix of the bladder and urinary tract, and thus prevent them from being washed out by the urine. type i pili, which is produced by all members of the enterobacteriaceae family, has long been implicated as an important virulence factor in mediating k. pneumoniae urinary infection  <cit> . alternatively, the ability to grow in urine may be important for the persistence of pathogens in the urinary tract. except for trace of amino acids, citrate is the only carbon source available in normal human urine.

in k. pneumoniae, little has been reported about the genomic basis for nutrient growth. we recently completed the whole-genome sequence of ntuh-k <dig>   <cit> , a k. pneumoniae strain isolated from the blood of a previously healthy individual who was diagnosed with a community-acquired primary liver abscess and metastatic meningitis  <cit> . by comparison with the available genome sequences of the other k. pneumoniae strains, mgh  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> , we discovered that the entire 13-kb chromosomal region carrying the aforementioned citrate fermentation genes in mgh  <dig> and  <dig> was missing in ntuh-k <dig>  we postulated that the 13-kb genomic region containing genes for citrate fermentation might facilitate the use of urine citrate in oxygen-limited or anaerobic conditions, and thus, permit the growth of k. pneumoniae in the urinary tract. to test this hypothesis, an artificial urine medium  designed to provide controlled composition of the human urine  <cit>  was used in this study to ensure reproducibility. the correlation between presence/absence of the citrate fermentation genes and anaerobic growth in this system was investigated. the distribution of the citrate fermentation genes among different k. pneumoniae clinical isolates was also analyzed.

RESULTS
the citrate fermentation genes in a 13-kb genomic region
located at 27916- <dig> bp in the genomic sequence of k. pneumoniae strain mgh  <dig>  the 13-kb citrate fermentation gene locus contains  <dig> orfs, which constitute two divergently transcribed operons citc2d2e2f2g <dig> and cits-oadgab-citab . the organization of these genes is the same as in the recently published k. pneumoniae  <dig> genome  <cit> . the dihydrodipicolinate reductase gene dapb and the hypothetical orfs located at the two ends of the 13-kb region in the mgh  <dig> and  <dig> genomes are next to each other in the ntuh-k <dig> genome. missing in the corresponding location, the citrate genes are nowhere found in the ntuh-k <dig> genome, and the region is replaced by a 155-bp non-coding sequence. since many genomic or pathogenicity islands found in bacteria genomes were associated with trna genes, we also tried to look for trna genes at the edge of this region. however, it appeared that the 13-kb genomic region carrying the citrate fermentation genes is not located within or near any trna gene, nor does it contain any direct repeat or known mobility sequence. this is in agreement with a recent study of bacterial genome flux, which indicated that, among twenty escherichia coli genomes, many of the integration hotspots are not necessarily recombinogenic  <cit> .

another gene cluster containing the citwx and the divergent cityz genes are conserved among k. pneumoniae genomes . in ntuh-k <dig>  the citwx-cityz gene cluster is located at  <dig> -bp downstream of the dapb. the existence of this additional gene cluster, especially the citx, is important for the function of citrate lyase in k. pneumoniae. unlike the counterpart identified in salmonella enterica , the 13-kb region in k. pneumoniae does not contain citx for the biosynthesis of the prosthetic group of citrate lyase  <cit> . in mgh  <dig>  the deduced amino acid sequences of city and citz are 43% and 41% identical to cita and citb, respectively.

nearly half of the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates carry the 13-kb genomic island
the presence/absence of the 13-kb region was investigated in additional k. pneumoniae clinical isolates . these isolates were collected from patients with pneumonia , bacteremia , liver abscess , uti , meningitis , and endophthalmitis . we conducted comparative genomic hybridization  analysis on the test strains with custom-made dna microarray , in which a total of  <dig>  probes were designed based on the cdss of five sequenced k. pneumoniae genomes  <cit> . for the current report, we have analyzed the results of the predicted coding sequences spanning the 13-kb region of mgh  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  each of the  <dig> strains  was compared against the ntuh-k <dig> reference genome. the dots represent the dna copy number log ratios between the reference and tested genomes for the  <dig> probes corresponding to the sequences spanning the 13-kb region. since the ntuh-k <dig> genome does not carry the cit genes, these results indicate that the  <dig> strains with dots plotted at the baseline in this region  do not carry these genes in their genomes. the other ten strains shown in below, including mgh  <dig>  gave higher signals for the cit genes than that from the reference . by contrast, all strains have the same copy number of the flanking genes  as the ntuh-k <dig> 

the oad genes within the 13-kb region are missing in ntuh-k <dig>  but the strain possesses an additional copy of oad genes at the tartrate-fermentation gene cluster outside this region. in contrast, according to the genomic sequence, mgh  <dig>  carries three copies of the oad genes, including one in the 13-kb region. this is also confirmed by the cgh result, which indicated that four strains, mgh  <dig>  nk <dig>  cmka <dig>  and cmka <dig>  carry more than one copy of the oad genes and showed higher signal in the oad-probed region. on the other hand, cmka <dig>  nk <dig> and cg <dig>  do not have oad genes and were represented by cgh plots below the baseline. we conclude that the 13-kb citrate fermentation gene sequence is not a uniform feature of k. pneumoniae and that the oadgab gene copy number is variable among the analyzed strains.

in a recent report, it is shown that all k. pneumoniae strains could grow on citrate as sole carbon source when tested aerobically  <cit> . a stark contrast is the ability of k. pneumoniae to grown on citrate anaerobically. while all k. pneumoniae isolates can grow on citrate aerobically, our results suggested that only about half of them carry the 13-kb gene cluster for anaerobic citrate utilization.

the 13-kb genomic island permits anaerobic growth in artificial urine
as citrate is a major carbon source in human urine, we then asked whether the 13-kb genomic island could contribute to k. pneumoniae growth in the urinary tract. although human urine is a suitable culture medium, the urine constituents can vary considerably between individuals under different conditions. it has been reported that the dissolved oxygen  in urine is about  <dig>  ppm, which is also variable and mainly reflects the renal metabolic state  <cit> . in patients with urinary infections, the urine do is significantly reduced as a result of oxygen consumption by the microbes  <cit> . therefore, in this study an artificial urine medium  developed to provide an experimental condition similar to that of the human urine  <cit>  was used. to simulate growth conditions in the urinary tract, k. pneumoniae isolates were cultured in aum at 37° under oxygen-deprived condition.

notable difference in the growth curves was observed when k. pneumoniae clinical strains were cultured anaerobically in aum. after  <dig> hours incubation, five strains with the 13-kb genomic island , showed significant growth in aum . in contrast, little growth  was detected for strains that do not have the 13-kb genomic island . the turbidities  of nk <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> at different time points during the 27-hour incubation in aum were also measured. note that little growth was detected in ntuh-k <dig>  a strain that lacks the citrate fermentation gene cluster , while exponential logarithmic phase growth was observed from  <dig> to  <dig> h in the nk <dig> strain that carries the 13-kb genomic island .

to demonstrate that the citrate fermentation genes present in the 13-kb region have allowed alternative use of carbon and energy source, a fosmid, f06c <dig>  which contains the entire 13-kb region from nk <dig>  was transformed into ntuh-k <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  this fosmid enabled the bacteria  to grow anaerobically in aum. the logarithmic growth  of the fosmid-transformed clone was shifted to the left and the cells reached the stationary phase earlier than that of the nk <dig>  this may be a result of gene copy number discrepancies between the fosmid transformants and nk <dig>  or a result of other genetic factors specific to the ntuh-k <dig> genome. similarly, the f06c <dig> fosmid sequence enabled the anaerobic growth of e. coli epi <dig>  transformants in aum . as a control, the k. pneumoniae strains ntuh-k <dig>  nk <dig>  ntuh-k2044-f06c <dig>  and nk8-Δcit were cultured anaerobically in aum medium prepared without citrate, all four strains showed no sign of growth in  <dig> hours.

to demonstrate that an intact citrate gene cluster is necessary for anaerobic growth, we created by homologous recombination a genetic mutant in which the entire cits and the nearby citc <dig> promoter was replaced with an apramycin resistance gene. the cits-citc <dig> intergenic region contains binding sites for the response regulator citb and cyclic amp receptor protein , which mediates catabolic repression of citrate fermentation genes under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the gene disruption was confirmed by pcr and sequencing of the region. the corresponding location of the altered sequence in the citrate fermentation island is indicated in figure 1a. as consistent with the fact that the citc <dig> and cits promoters control the expression of the citc2d2e2f2g <dig> and cits-oadgab-citab operons, disruption of this regulatory region in the resultant strain, nk8-Δcit, crippled its ability to grow anaerobically in aum  . taken together, our data support that the citrate fermentation island permits and is necessary for anaerobic growth of k. pneumoniae in aum using citrate as the sole carbon source.

citrate fermentation gene cluster in k. pneumoniae clinical isolates
from the genetic studies on the citrate fermentation in aum, it seems plausible that the ability of k. pneumoniae to grow in urine may provide the organism an added advantage in urinary tract infections , thus a higher percentage of citrate fermentation genomic island-positive k. pneumoniae strains would be expected in urine isolates than in non-urine isolates. to test this hypothesis, a total of  <dig> k. pneumoniae clinical isolates collected from urine and non-urine specimens including blood, respiratory tract, wound, bile, ear, eye, and iv catheters, were analyzed for the presence of the 13-kb island by using  <dig> pcr primer pairs designed across the region . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig>  urine isolates carried the genomic island, while 53/ <dig>  of non-urine were test positive for the gene cluster. thus, we did not find apparent correlation between the possession of the 13-kb genomic region and urinary tract infection in this case collection.

* note: strains with positive results using all  <dig> primer sets are regarded as positive for the 13-kb region.

in uropathogenetic e. coli strains, adhesins enable the anchorage to urinary tract to overcome the hydrodynamics of micturition, even though e. coli cannot live solely on citrate in anaerobic condition  <cit> . other factors in the k. pneumoniae genome likely also contribute to urinary infection. to investigate the host-microbial interaction in uti and to overcome the complex clinical situations, animal models will be necessary for determining the role of this 13-kb genomic island in k. pneumoniae in colonizing the urinary tract.

genomic diversity on citrate fermentation
the genes associated with citrate fermentation are different in composition and order in the sequenced enterobacteriaceae genomes . in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt <dig> , which is capable of citrate fermentation using the same pathway, two gene clusters similar to the 13-kb region are present in the genome . one of them  showing similar gene arrangement  was identified between the rna rnase i gene  and the dcuc c4-dicarboxylate transporter gene  in the lt <dig> genome. the other   was found between rihc putative nucleotide hydrolase gene  and dapb . both loci in lt <dig> carry the citx gene in respect to that of the 13-kb island of k. pneumoniae. based on the composition of the gene clusters and the genes at the vicinity, it appears that the second copy  from lt <dig> is more related  to the 13-kb island of k. pneumoniae, albeit three hypothetical orfs  next to the citb in k. pneumoniae are missing in lt <dig>  the first copy of the gene cluster from lt <dig>  as shown in figure 1b, is similar in gene organization to the citrate fermentation gene cluster in e. coli k <dig> , which contains a citab and a divergent citcdefxgt positioned next to the rna rnase i gene  . the citt encodes a citrate-succinate antiporter for citrate uptake in e. coli  <cit> . while the citrate fermentation genes corresponding to locus i is missing in k. pneumoniae, homologs of the rna and dcuc identified at the two ends of this gene cluster were juxtaposed to each other in the k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig> , mgh  <dig>  and  <dig> . on the other hand, homologs of the rihc and dapb, the genes flanking the two ends of the 13-kb genomic island from k. pneumoniae, were found adjacent to each other in the e. coli k <dig> genome .

in the mgh  <dig>  three oad gene clusters were found, one located in the 13-kb citrate fermentation gene cluster, another located at the downstream of the galetkm genes for galactose metabolism, and the third located near the ttda and ttdb genes for tartrate fermentation  <cit> . in k. pneumoniae  <dig> , the oad gene downstream of galetkm is missing while the other two copies were kept. in ntuh-k <dig>  the oad genes associated with the 13-kb region as well as the other copy proximal to the galactose metabolism genes were missing; only the copy near the tartrate dehydratase genes was found in the genome. as demonstrated in s. enterica, oxaloacetate decarboxylase is involved in the fermentation of tartrate, presumably following the reaction of tartrate dehydratase, in which tartrate is converted to oxaloacetate  <cit> . it is conceivable that the oad genes were recruited to the vicinity of these genes and evolved into operons dedicated to different metabolic functions. incorporation of the oadgab genes in the 13-kb region is likely a result of a secondary insertion event after the acquisition of the cit genes in the ancestral microorganism. this is supported by the data that the g+c contents of the oad genes are apparently higher than the neighbouring orfs .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report distinguishing citrate fermentation biotypes of k. pneumoniae. it appears that the genomic variation of citrate fermentation genes among these strains might be more extensive than previously thought since only half of the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates we tested carry the 13-kb genomic island for citrate fermentation. the possession of these genes contributes to their adaptation to different nutrient conditions.
