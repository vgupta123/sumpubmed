BACKGROUND
reactive carbonyl species  are usually produced as metabolites in living systems including prokaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals. among rcs are the highly reactive α-carbonyl compounds methylglyoxal  and glyoxal . mg is formed primarily as a by-product of glycolysis via the β-elimination of phosphate from the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate . go is generated by oxidative degradation of lipid and dna, and oxidation of glycolaldehyde. rcs can rapidly react with the amino groups in proteins, nucleic acids and lipids to form toxic or mutagenic advanced glycation endproducts  and cause carbonyl stress. rcs have been linked to diverse human diseases, including diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases , and aging .

the major system for reactive α-carbonyl species detoxification in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes involves two enzymes, glyoxalase i  and glyoxalase ii  . glo <dig> converts mg into s-d-lactoylglutathione  with glutathione  as a catalytic cofactor, and then glo <dig> hydrolyzes slg to d-lactate and gsh. most recently, a gsh-independent glyoxalase system was identified in escherichia coli, caenorhabditis elegans, mice and humans  <cit> . in this system, glyoxalase iii  converts mg directly into d-lactate in a single step, independent of gsh.

in animals, glo <dig> activity appears to reside in dj- <dig> proteins  <cit> . the glo <dig> activity of dj- <dig> proteins seems to play an important role in protecting cells against α-dicarbonyl-induced cell death  <cit> . human dj- <dig>  is a cancer- and parkinson’s disease -associated protein  <cit> . besides playing a role in α-dicarbonyl detoxification, hsdj- <dig> has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation  <cit> , regulation of mitochondrial function  <cit> , molecular chaperone  <cit>  and protease activities  <cit> , and, most strikingly, protection against oxidative stress  <cit> . it appears that oxidation at the conserved cysteine residue  is critically required for dj- <dig> function  <cit> . however, the mechanism of how hsdj- <dig> executes these functions remains to be determined.

the closely related homologs of hsdj- <dig>  are found in a wide variety of eukaryotes  <cit> , but the species distribution of this gene appears to be complex. unlike mammals, which contain a single dj- <dig> gene, drosophila melanogaster has two dj- <dig> genes   <cit> , which differ in tissue distribution. dj-1α is detected primarily in the testes from the pupal to the adult stage, whereas dj-1β is found in most tissues from embryo to adults  <cit> . similar to drosophila, c. elegans has two dj- <dig> genes , both of which encode glo <dig>  <cit> . cdjr- <dig>  is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the intestine, while cdjr- <dig>  is detected in various tissues and is only present in the cytoplasm  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana genome has six dj- <dig> genes, among which atdj-1d encodes an enzyme that has the highest glo <dig> activity  <cit> . besides, a close homolog of hsdj- <dig> called spdj- <dig>  has been found in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> .

the most closely related homologs of dj- <dig> in prokaryotes are yajl proteins. the best characterized yajl protein is the e. coli yajl protein . like dj- <dig>  ecyajl protects cells against oxidative stress  <cit> . the conserved cysteine  <dig> of ecyajl can form mixed disulfides with cytoplasmic proteins including chaperones, proteases, ribosomal proteins, catalases, peroxidases and fes proteins. this covalent chaperone activity of ecyajl is required to protect against protein aggregation and sulfenylation during oxidative stress  <cit> . however, unlike dj- <dig>  ecyajl does not display any activity to mg  <cit> .

the principal glo <dig> enzyme responsible for converting mg to d-lactate without a cofactor in e. coli is echsp <dig>   <cit> , which shares only 14% sequence identity to hsdj- <dig>  it has been suggested that echsp <dig> is involved in protecting stationary cells against dicarbonyl stress  <cit> . in addition, echsp <dig> is a heat-inducible molecular chaperone  <cit>  that plays a role in protecting cells against multiple stresses including heat shock and starvation  <cit> . echsp <dig> is also involved in the management of protein misfolding under acid stress  <cit> . however, unlike dj- <dig> proteins, echsp <dig> does not appear to be involved in oxidative stress response  <cit> .

close homologs of echsp <dig>  have been found in bacteria and fungi  <cit> . schsp <dig> , a saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of echsp <dig>  is involved in the protection of yeast cells against reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

based on sequence comparison, dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins belong to different subfamilies of the dj-1/hsp31/pfpi superfamily, which encompasses a wide variety of functionally diverse proteins  <cit> . both dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins possess the glu-cys-his catalytic triad. the first two triad residues  are in the same locations in the two enzymes and are essential for glo <dig> activity  <cit> . in contrast, the third triad residue his  resides at different sequence and structural positions, and is less important for enzyme activity  <cit> . in addition, hsp <dig> proteins also have a potential cysteine protease-like catalytic triad  of unknown functions  <cit> .

structural and bioinformatic studies reveal that hsp <dig> proteins but not dj- <dig>  yajl and pfpi proteins have a p domain, which is likely involved in hsp <dig> dimer formation and substrate binding  <cit> . furthermore, hsp <dig> proteins can clearly be divided into class i and class ii proteins based on their structural and sequence similarity  <cit> . class i proteins represented by echsp <dig> contain a complete p domain, whereas class ii proteins represented by schsp <dig> contain a shorter p domain and have glu instead of asp as the third member of a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad  <cit> .

to better understand the origins and functions of glo <dig>  we investigated the distribution and diversity of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins in a broad diversity of fungal species since glo <dig> activity is most likely to reside in these proteins. this is the first comprehensive survey of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins in fungi. we also provide evidence that fungal homologs of the dj-1/hsp31/pfpi superfamily may function as glo <dig> 

RESULTS
candidate dj- <dig> proteins are present only in a very limited number of fungal species
to determine the distribution of dj- <dig> proteins in fungi, we performed extensive blast searches against fungal databases using hsdj- <dig> as a query sequence. in total, we have examined  <dig> sequenced fungal species, including  <dig> ascomycota,  <dig> basidiomycota,  <dig> zygomycota,  <dig> chytridiomycota and  <dig> microsporidia. we identified  <dig> candidate dj- <dig> proteins from a total of  <dig> fungal species . among them, only four  have been previously reported  <cit> . identical results were obtained when ecyajl was used as a query sequence. however, no dj- <dig> protein was found by the blast search by using echsp <dig> as a query.

the distribution of dj- <dig> proteins in the two phyla of higher fungi is different. the majority of fungal species within the largest and most phylogenetically diverse phylum of fungi, the ascomycota, lack dj- <dig>  we identified  <dig> dj- <dig> proteins from the pezizomycotina, all of them belonging to the dothideomycetes class. in addition, we identified dj- <dig> proteins from all four sequenced schizosaccharomyces species  belonging to the taphrinomycotina, the basal subphylum of ascomycota. these four fission yeast species are the only members of the taphrinomycotina whose genomes have been sequenced so far. unlike species in the ascomycota, many sequenced species of the basidiomycota phylum contain dj- <dig> proteins. we identified  <dig> basidiomycete dj- <dig> proteins in  <dig> species from all three subphyla of basidiomycota.

fungal species from the basal phyla chytridiomycota, zygomycota and microsporidia are currently under-represented in the current genomic databases. nevertheless, dj- <dig> proteins were identified in all completely sequenced chytridiomycetes and zygomycetes. unlike chytridiomycetes and zygomycetes, all sequenced microsporidians appear to lack dj- <dig> proteins likely due to their extreme genome reduction and compaction  <cit> .

among some of fungal species that possess dj- <dig> proteins, three species have two dj- <dig> proteins. fission yeast s. japonicus and chytrid species allomyces macrogynus contain two candidate dj- <dig> proteins with 70% and 94% sequence identities, respectively. in addition, the basidiomycete postia placenta also appears to have two dj- <dig> proteins , although the full-length sequence of the latter candidate could not be accurately predicted due to the sequence gaps.

conservation of candidate fungal dj- <dig> proteins
to evaluate the sequence conservation between fungal and higher eukaryotic dj- <dig> proteins, we aligned dj- <dig> sequences from fungi, human, fly, worm, and plant . we also included ecyajl and echsp <dig> for comparison. the fission yeast dj- <dig> protein sequences were more divergent from human, fly, worm, and plant dj- <dig> protein sequences than any other identified fungal dj- <dig> sequences. moreover, dj- <dig> protein sequences from basal fungi are more similar to those from selected higher eukaryotes compared with their homologs from higher fungi. for example, dj- <dig> proteins from basal and higher fungi share 40-43% and 23-39% overall sequence identity to hsdj- <dig>  respectively.

fungal dj- <dig> proteins exhibit a degree of amino acid sequence conservation with ecyajl, with identity ranging from 23-36% . in contrast, fungal dj- <dig> proteins exhibit extremely weak sequence similarity to echsp <dig>  sharing as little as 9% amino acid identity with echsp <dig>  illustrating extraordinary degree of divergence between dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins .

while the majority of fungal dj- <dig> proteins have a conserved catalytic triad , the conserved his residue of the catalytic triad is replaced by either phe or tyr in three identified zygomycete dj- <dig> proteins  . interestedly, this conserved his residue is also replaced by tyr in the bombyx mori dj- <dig> protein   <cit> .

candidate hsp <dig> proteins are widely present in fungal species
to identify hsp <dig> proteins from fungi, we conducted blast searches against fungal databases using the protein sequence of echsp <dig> as a query. unlike dj- <dig> proteins, candidate hsp <dig> proteins were found in all fungal species we examined, except  <dig> saccharomycotina species,  <dig> basidiomycota species and  <dig> chytridiomycota species. overall, we identified a total of  <dig> fungal hsp <dig> proteins from  <dig> fungal species, including  <dig> ascomycota species,  <dig> basidiomycota species,  <dig> chytridiomycota species, and  <dig> zygomycota species .

+the number of amino acids in the fungal hsp <dig> proteins.

the number of hsp <dig> proteins is highly variable among fungal species . it is notable that while the majority of fungal species have one or two candidate hsp <dig> proteins, some fungal species have as many as four hsp <dig> proteins. the ascomycetous fungus nectria haematococca , appears to possess the largest number of hsp <dig> proteins  so far identified. another ascomycete, aspergillus niger, has the second largest number of hsp <dig> proteins . s. cerevisiae has four hsp <dig> homologs, ydr533c, ypl280w, yor391c and ymr322c, which have been named schsp <dig>  schsp <dig>  schsp <dig> and schsp <dig> , respectively  <cit> . s. pombe has five hsp <dig> proteins, which we named hsp <dig> , hsp <dig> , hsp <dig> , hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> .

conservation of candidate fungal hsp <dig> proteins
to assess the extent of sequence conservation among fungal hsp <dig> proteins, we performed multiple sequence alignment of hsp <dig> protein sequences from taxonomically diverse fungal species . for comparison, we also included hsdj- <dig> and echsp <dig> 

based on sequence comparison, fungal hsp <dig> proteins can be divided into different classes. the majority of fungal hsp <dig> proteins belong to class ii that contains a short p domain. in contrast, only five proteins belong to class i that contains a p domain. interestingly, class i fungal hsp <dig> proteins were only found in the pezizomycotina species that belong to the order hypocreales within the class sordariomycetes. in addition to these previously noted classes, some fungal hsp <dig> proteins appear to form a new class which we have termed class iii. class iii hsp <dig> proteins have a short p domain and are highly divergent in sequence from other classes of hsp <dig> proteins. these proteins were found mainly in pezizomycotina species, but were absent from all examined saccharomycotina species.

the sequence similarity between different hsp <dig> proteins of the same species varies considerably among different species. in s. cerevisiae, the four hsp <dig> proteins, which all belong to class ii, are highly similar to each other . among these, schsp <dig>  schsp <dig> and schsp <dig> are almost identical to each other . similarly, two candida albicans hsp <dig> proteins, all belonging to class ii, share  <dig> % identity. in contrast, the two aspergillus nidulans hsp <dig> proteins belonging to class ii and class iii, respectively, share only 19% identity. among the five s. pombe hsp <dig> proteins, which all belong to class ii, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> are more closely related to each other than they are to other hsp <dig> proteins .

the phylogenetic relationship between fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins
to examine the relationship between fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins, we generated a bayesian phylogenetic tree from an alignment of representative fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins. in addition to fungal sequences, we also included hsp <dig> and yajl proteins from representative bacterial species and dj- <dig> proteins from representative metazoan species in our analyses. our phylogenic reconstruction revealed that bacterial yajl proteins and fungal and metazoan dj- <dig> proteins form a monophyletic group to the exclusion of all hsp <dig> proteins, indicating that dj- <dig> and yajl proteins are very closely related to each other. by contrast, dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins form two sister clades with bayesian posterior probability of  <dig>  . the phylogenic reconstitution also revealed that fungal hsp <dig> proteins can be further divided into different classes. this is congruent with the classification of fungal hsp <dig> proteins based on sequence analysis. in addition, the phylogeny suggests that the presence of multiple hsp <dig> genes identified in many fungal species is due to recent duplication events.

prediction of subcellular localization of candidate fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins
we predicted the subcellular localization of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins using the programs mitoprot, targetp and ipsort. of all  <dig> fungal dj- <dig> proteins analyzed, only dj- <dig> from the basidiomycetous anamorphic yeast rhodotorula glutinis  has potential nuclear localization signals . rgldj- <dig> appears to have two nls: 2rrrr <dig> and 184rkkr <dig>  which reside at the n- and c-terminus, respectively. however, despite a lack of nlss in fungal dj- <dig> proteins, it is possible that they are localized in nucleus given that a classical nls could not be detected in hsdj- <dig>  but hsdj- <dig> is localized in the nucleus  <cit> , as well as the cytoplasm and mitochondria  <cit> . indeed, we found that spdj- <dig> localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm . among  <dig> fungal hsp <dig> proteins identified,  <dig> hsp <dig> proteins are predicted to the nucleus, and  <dig> hsp <dig> proteins are predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria .

hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  schsp <dig> and spdj- <dig> possess gsh-independent glyoxalase activity
candidate hsp <dig> and dj- <dig> proteins are present in fungi, but their roles in mg detoxification have not been studied in any fungal species. to determine whether fungal hsp <dig> and dj- <dig> proteins are indeed glo <dig> enzymes, we chose to examine dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins from s. pombe and s. cerevisiae, including spdj- <dig>  hsp3101- <dig>  schsp <dig> and schsp <dig>  hsp <dig> was not examined because it lacks the conserved residues critical for glo <dig> activity and is unlikely to possess glo <dig> activity . we also did not examine the glo <dig> activity of schsp <dig> and schsp <dig> because their sequences are almost identical to the sequence of schsp <dig>  we were able to obtain all but two of the soluble recombinant proteins by using either the pet expression system or the esp® yeast protein expression. two exceptions were hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  which were expressed as inclusion bodies in e. coli and s. pombe. as expected, spdj- <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig> could directly convert mg to lactate, which was detected by using the dnph colorimetric method. the hplc analysis of the reaction mixtures showed a peak with a retention time of  <dig>  min identical to that expected for lactate, confirming the conversion of mg to lactate by these recombinant proteins . in contrast, recombinant schsp <dig> exhibited no detectable glo <dig> activity.

we measured the km and kcat values for the recombinant proteins that exhibited glyoxalase activity. hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig> have comparable apparent kcat/km values for mg . these values are similar to those reported for hsdj- <dig>  <cit>  and echsp <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the kcat/km value for spdj- <dig> is  <dig>  × 103 min-1 m- <dig>  which is about 15-fold lower than those for hsdj- <dig> and echsp <dig> . the reduction in catalytic efficiency for mg apparently is primarily caused by an increase in the km value.

all enzyme assays were done in triplicate, and the mean values are presented. nd, not determined. the kinetic parameters of spdj-1e16a, spdj-1c111a and schsp <dig> cannot be accurately measured because of the extremely low activity of these proteins.

fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins have similar predicted catalytic triads . to test whether the proposed catalytic triad is important for the glo <dig> activity of spdj- <dig>  we individually mutated these residues to ala and purified the mutant enzymes . mutations of glu <dig> and cys <dig> to ala nearly completely abolished the enzymatic activity, whereas the h130a substitution led to a 5- to 6-fold reduction in the catalytic efficiency.

overexpression of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  schsp <dig> and echsp <dig> can confer resistance to mg and go
since hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and spdj- <dig> possess glo <dig> activity in vitro, we wanted to assess whether hsp3101- <dig> and spdj- <dig> can function as glo <dig> in vivo. we first deleted their corresponding genes individually or in combination and examined the sensitivity of the mutant strains to mg and go. these mutant strains showed sensitivity similar to that of the isogenic wild-type strain, suggesting that hsp3101- <dig> and spdj- <dig> may be functionally redundant for mg and go detoxification .

next, we wanted to determine whether overexpression of hsp3101- <dig> and spdj- <dig> under the control of the nmt <dig> promoter  <cit>  could modulate the sensitivity of s. pombe cells to mg and go. overexpression of hsp <dig> and, to a lesser extent, hsp <dig> increased the survival of wild-type pombe cells during growth in the presence of either mg or go. in fact, overexpression of hsp <dig> displayed increased mg and go resistance to a degree similar to overexpression of spglo <dig> . interestingly, overexpression of schsp <dig> and, to a lesser extent, echsp <dig> in wild-type pombe cells increased resistance to mg or go, suggesting functional conservation of hsp <dig> proteins across species. unlike overexpression of hsp3101- <dig>  overexpression of spdj- <dig> led to enhanced resistance to go, but not to mg . in contrast, overexpression of hsp <dig>  schsp <dig> and hsdj- <dig> did not affect the sensitivity of wild-type s. pombe cells to mg or go .

we also tested the effect of overexpression of hsp3101- <dig> and spdj- <dig> in a ∆spglo <dig> strain on sensitivity to mg. the ∆spglo <dig> strain is much more sensitive to mg than the wild-type strain, which is consistent with its role as the major enzyme responsible for mg detoxification . similar to overexpression of spglo <dig>  overexpression of schsp <dig>  echsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> markedly suppressed the mg sensitivity of ∆spglo <dig> cells, indicating that overexpression of these hsp <dig> genes were able to compensate for the absence of spglo <dig> in s. pombe . in contrast, overexpression of hsp <dig>  schsp <dig>  spdj- <dig> and hsdj- <dig> did not affect the sensitivity of the ∆spglo <dig> mutant to mg .

hsp <dig> and spdj- <dig> are both nuclear and cytoplasmic whereas hsp <dig> is exclusively cytoplasmic
a previous genome-wide subcellular localization study using enhanced green fluorescent protein  fusions under the control of the intermediate-strength nmt <dig> promoter  <cit>  showed that spdj- <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, hsp <dig> is cytoplasmic, and hsp <dig> is predominantly nuclear  <cit> . however, the subcellular localization of hsp <dig> is unclear. since the gfp fusions used in the genome-wide study may be mislocalized due to overexpression of these fusions  <cit> . to determine the subcellular localization of hsp <dig> and to verify the results from the genome-wide study, we examined the localization of the c-terminal gfp fusions of spdj- <dig> and hsp3101- <dig> expressed from their endogenous loci. consistent with results obtained by the genome-wide study, spdj-1-gfp and hsp3101-gfp are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm . however, in our analysis, hsp3102-gfp is only localized in the cytoplasm, not in nucleus . the localization of other gfp-tagged hsp <dig> proteins could not be unequivocally determined, most likely due to very low levels of expression of these proteins.

discussion
to better understand the origin and evolution of glo <dig>  we performed the first comprehensive survey of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins in a wide range of taxonomically diverse fungal species. our studies revealed that most fungal species examined lack dj- <dig> proteins. the fact that dj- <dig> proteins are present in many basidiomycetes and all sequenced basal fungi, but are absent from most species in the ascomycota, suggests that dj- <dig> proteins were lost in recent fungal evolution. unlike dj- <dig> proteins, hsp <dig> proteins are widely distributed among phylogenetically distant fungal species, indicating that hsp <dig> proteins were retained during fungal evolution. the distribution of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins in fungi appears to be in sharp contrast to the situation in metazoans, where dj- <dig> proteins are ubiquitous, whereas hsp <dig> proteins are largely absent . these results imply that dj- <dig> proteins appeared before the divergence of metazoans from fungi, and that hsp <dig> proteins were lost after the divergence of metazoan and fungal lineages.

to determine whether fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins are functional glo <dig>  we characterized candidate dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins from s. pombe and s. cerevisiae. it appears that spdj- <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig> possess glo <dig> activity in vitro. however, under our assay conditions, spdj- <dig> seems to have a lower enzymatic activity than other glo <dig> enzymes, suggesting that spdj- <dig> may be less efficient as a glo <dig> in s. pombe.

although direct evidence demonstrating the in vivo role of fungal hsp <dig> proteins in mg and go detoxification is still lacking, we showed that overexpression of the two most closely related s. pombe hsp <dig> genes  could confer mg and go resistance on s. pombe wild-type and ∆spglo <dig> cells, suggesting that these two s. pombe hsp <dig> proteins may play some role in protecting cells from mg and go toxicity. we also found that overexpression of schsp <dig> and echsp <dig> could also increase the resistance of s. pombe cells to mg and go, suggesting functional conservation of hsp <dig> proteins from e. coli, s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. it will be important in future studies to elucidate the physiological function of glo <dig> enzymes.

it is not clear at present why many fungal species bear more than one hsp <dig> genes. some of them do not appear to encode glo <dig>  among five s. pombe hsp <dig> proteins, hsp <dig> lacks the conserved residues critical for glo <dig> activity, and is thus unlikely to function as a glo <dig>  our biochemical studies reveal that s. cerevisiae schsp <dig> did not exhibit any glo <dig> activity. since the sequence of schsp <dig> is nearly identical to those of schsp <dig> and schsp <dig>  it is likely that only one of the four s. cerevisiae hsp <dig> proteins  has glo <dig> activity. other hsp <dig> proteins  may have other in vivo substrates. in support of this idea, it has recently found that the size and orientation of the active site pockets of the hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> are markedly different  <cit> .

unlike hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and spdj- <dig> are both nuclear and cytoplasmic. although the physiological relevance of the differences in subcellular distribution of these proteins is unclear at present, it seems likely that nuclear spdj- <dig> and hsp <dig> pools may play a role in the regulation of gene expression. this hypothesis is consistent with previous studies reporting that a nuclear pool of hsdj- <dig> regulates the expression of some genes through stabilization of the antioxidant transcriptional master regulator nrf <dig>  <cit> . for example, hsdj- <dig> up-regulates thioredoxin  <dig> gene expression via nrf2-mediated transcriptional induction  <cit> .

our analysis reveals that fungal dj- <dig> proteins are phylogenetically most closely related to bacterial yajl proteins, consistent with previous studies  <cit> . besides, the overall structures of dj- <dig> and yajl are also very similar   <cit> . it is thus likely that dj- <dig> and yajl proteins may have evolved from the same ancestor protein. in contrast, hsp <dig> proteins are much less similar in sequence to dj- <dig> proteins than are yajl proteins  <cit> . moreover, although both hsp <dig> and dj- <dig> proteins contain the same structurally conserved core domain characterized by an α/β sandwich fold, hsp <dig> proteins have structural properties, including an additional p domain and a different dimerization interface, that distinguish them from dj- <dig> proteins  <cit> . however, despite the extensive sequence and structural divergence  <cit> , many identified e. coli and fungal hsp <dig> proteins possess glo <dig> activity in vitro, suggesting that dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins may have emerged independently.

during preparation of this manuscript, hasim et al. reported the crystal structure and the functional studies of the candida albicans hsp <dig> protein, glx3p   <cit> . they demonstrated that glx3p possesses in vitro glo <dig> activity. the kcat/km value of glx3p reported by hasim et al. is  <dig>  × 103 m-1s- <dig>  which is comparable to our kcat/km values for hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig>  while in this paper, hasim et al. mainly focused on the c. albicans glx3p, they also reported the specific activities of spdj- <dig> and schsp <dig>  however, the kinetic parameters for these two enzymes were not reported. consistent with our results, they found that glx3p and schsp <dig> are considerably more active than spdj- <dig> . however, in contrast to our findings that single and combined deletions of s. pombe dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> genes did not result in an increase in sensitivity to mg, they found that deleting glx <dig> caused increased sensitivity to mg. we believe that the difference may be due to functional redundancy of s. pombe dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins. furthermore, our results extend their findings to show that some of fungal hsp <dig> proteins may not be glo <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first large-scale identification and analysis of fungal dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins. our survey shows that hsp <dig> proteins are widespread throughout the fungal kingdom, whereas dj- <dig> proteins are restricted to certain fungal phyla. the apparent lack of dj- <dig> genes in the majority of fungal species suggests that they may have lost during fungal evolution. sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses reveal that fungal hsp <dig> proteins can be further divided into different classes. our analysis reveals that fungal hsp <dig> proteins may serve as the major glo <dig> in fungi, although some of them may not be glo <dig>  the glo <dig> activity of hsp <dig> proteins may have occurred independently from that of dj- <dig> proteins. our results further suggest that hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> are the major glo <dig> that may have some role in protecting cells from rcs toxicity in s. pombe, and that spdj- <dig> and hsp <dig> may also participate in nuclear-related functions.
