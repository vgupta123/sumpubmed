BACKGROUND
the full nature of the human transcriptome is taking shape thanks to highly efficient sequencing strategies that reach unprecedented depth  <cit> . layers of long and short rnas with unknown biological functions keep emerging  <cit> . a particularly intriguing family of non-protein coding rnas are natural antisense transcripts   <cit> . nats are commonly understood to be transcribed from the complementary dna strand of protein coding genes. processing of the primary antisense transcripts result in mrnas that share complementary exons with the related sense transcript  <cit> . genomic loci that express nats are highly abundant and sense/antisense transcript pairs tend to be co-expressed  <cit> . the most comprehensive studies predict that in human and mice 40-72% of all transcriptional units show evidence of bi-directional transcription  <cit> . nats are most prominently found in testis, they are also detectable at low levels in other tissues  <cit> . interestingly, the occurrence of nats correlates with genes that show imbalanced allelic expression   <cit> . this observation suggests that nats carry the potential to induce allele-specific gene silencing. accordingly, they are significantly under-represented on the mammalian x chromosome  <cit> . sirnas can potentially trigger transcriptional gene silencing and, interestingly, endo-sirnas originating from sense/antisense rna pairs have been detected in several model systems; however, the nature of these endo-sirnas has not been thoroughly investigated  <cit> .

the potential of nats to form rna-rna hybrids with the sense transcript can trigger various mechanisms and regulatory cascades. the three best supported ones are rna masking, the establishment of chromatin marks and rna interference. rna masking describes a process where the antisense transcript occludes a regulatory motif in the sense rna by direct base pairing. depending on the nature of these motifs the interactions stabilize or de-stabilize the mrna  <cit> . well-documented examples include the hypoxia induced factor 1α  and β-secretase  <cit> .

chromatin modification as a result of ectopic expression of nats has been linked to human disease  <cit> . a rare form of α thalassemia is caused by a genomic deletion that brings a constitutively active gene  into close vicinity to the hba <dig> gene. the resulting antisense transcript was shown to induce methylation of a gc island in the promoter of hba <dig> and silence the gene  <cit> . in addition, a tumor suppressor gene  was shown to be epigenetically silenced by antisense transcription. p <dig> is repressed in a variety of cancers and an inverse expression of sense and antisense transcripts was discovered in leukemic cells  <cit> .

the involvement of nat-triggered rna interference in gene regulation is supported by research focusing on the slc34a gene . in this case, endo-sirnas derived from sense/antisense overlaps were found in mouse testis and kidneys  <cit> . moreover, large scale sequencing approaches also found endo-sirnas originating from bi-directionally transcribed loci  <cit> .

rna interference involves two key enzymatic components, an endo-ribonuclease and an effector protein complex. the endonucleases, dicer or drosha, process double-stranded rna precursors into short rna duplexes of about  <dig> base pairs. these oligonucleotides are integrated into effector complexes that include an argonaute protein  <cit> . one of the rna strands is unwound and becomes quickly degraded  <cit> . the remaining single stranded rna molecule, the guide strand, directs the rna-protein complex to its biological target. rna interference was initially thought to be a predominantly cytoplasmic process; however, recent studies have detected dicer and argonaute proteins in the nucleus associated with chromatin. moreover, argonaute-dependent processes have been documented to alter chromatin marks and also the dynamics of rna polymerase ii was shown to be affected by argonaute and dicer  <cit> .

a putative link between antisense transcription and the synthesis of endo-sirnas has not been comprehensively investigated. we used total rna from cloned of hek <dig> cells to determine the short rna transcriptome. the analysis focused on reads that mapped to exons of protein-coding genes. our findings suggest that sense/antisense transcripts can feed into an rna interference related pathway. the resulting low levels of endo-sirnas contribute to a stable short rna signature in differentiated somatic cells.

RESULTS
analysis of endo-sirnas
to avoid cell heterogeneity due to the accumulation of stochastic mutations we first cloned hek- <dig> cells by serial dilution. a single clone was selected and expanded for short rna sequencing. total rna was isolated, size selected and then used to generate a directional cdna library. the material was amplified and sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  million parsed reads were obtained and annotated to the human genome . the most prevalent of the genic short rnas were micrornas  and short structural rnas . genic short rnas comprised 5% of the reads of which 1%  were between  <dig> and  <dig> bases long . in total,  <dig> genes gave rise to genic short rnas . the genes are localized on all but the y chromosome which is not present in hek <dig> cells. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contain a proportionally high number of genes with short rnas . because of the relatively small size of the remaining data set the analysis was performed using the ucsc table browser and spread sheet functions. size distribution of the short rnas shows a broad peak between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides which concurs with the size of endo-sirnas  or 21- <dig> nucleotides if collapsed . the majority of endo-sirnas reads were found to be in sense orientation with respect to the parent gene ,  <dig> % were antisense . similar observations have been reported, indicating that preferentially the sense transcript gives rise to short rnas  <cit> . moreover, only  <dig> %  displayed significant read counts  in both sense and antisense orientation. of note, manual scrutiny of the  <dig> genes revealed that  <dig> genes, tmem <dig>  lppr <dig> and lypd <dig>  contributed disproportionally to the dataset with almost 63% of the reads. these  <dig> genes have exonic hairpin structures that feed into micro rna processing  or are possibly related to pirnas  and are therefore excluded from the quantitative analysis of expanded endo-sirna reads.

first, we investigated putative sources of genic endo-sirnas; stalled rna polymerase ii  and the rna interference pathway both being linked to the genesis of these rna species. to assess the involvement of rnapii we downloaded the publicly available rnapii chip-seq data  from the geo database   <cit> .

collapsed reads were manually binned into  <dig> categories, first 5′ exon , middle exons , last 3′ exon  and single exon genes  using igv  followed by intersection with rnapii occupancy using the ucsc table browser. as expected, both co-localization  as well as signal strength  was highest for reads mapping to the first 5′exon. these values decreased to 65%/ <dig>  integrated units in internal exons and  <dig> %/ <dig>  units in the final exons. single exon genes showed average occupancy and intensity  . next, the reads mapping to rnapii occupancy were quantified with respect to their length; profiles were established for all reads intersecting with rnapii occupancy  as well as for reads that map to highly rnapii occupied regions  . short rnas of 21- <dig> nt were found to predominantly map with rnapii occupied sites in addition to lesser populated length bins . interestingly, increased stringency predominantly depleted rnas of 20- <dig> nucleotides and of 26- <dig> nucleotides from the data set . the peak of 21- <dig> nt was notably sharper  indicating a possible weak association between components of the rnai machinery and rnapii  <cit> .

the star  indicates discrepancies in “total sirna reads” between top and bottom panel that arose from conversion of the clash data from genome assemblies hg <dig> to hg <dig> 

next, the collapsed and binned reads were intersected with a clash  dataset that was generated using an antibody against ago <dig> and uv treated hek cells, kindly provided by a. helwak and d. tollervey  <cit> . we found that about 60% of the endo-sirna reads overlapped with an average of about  <dig>  clash reads throughout multi-exon genes . single exon genes, constituting predominantly histone genes in this dataset, showed a markedly different coverage with an  <dig> % overlap between the two datasets and  <dig>  clash reads per collapsed endo-sirna. there was again evidence for an interaction between the rnapii machinery and ago <dig> as the endo-sirna peak of 21- <dig> nucleotides gradually decreased from 5′ end to internal exons and 3′end .

convergent transcription
in order to test the hypothesized link between convergent transcription and endo-sirnas we compiled characteristic parameters of each individual gene associated with endo-sirnas. the argument was that convergent transcription of genes in close vicinity will favor endo-sirna production. first, the distance to both neighboring genes was determined by subtracting the end coordinate of the last exon from the start coordinate of the first exon of the following gene. the parameters collected of the  <dig> genes included orientation, length and exon-number, distance to neighboring genes and their orientation as well as the number and orientation of reads. the finding, that  <dig> % of the genic reads were oriented in antisense to the transcript of origin may suggest a role for antisense transcription in generating endo-sirnas.

we sorted the  <dig> genes with a near neighbor in tail-to-tail configuration according to the distance between the two genes to assess if the potential antisense transcript promotes the formation of endo-sirnas. as figure  <dig> demonstrates, there is no link between distance and configuration of neighboring genes  and the number of endo-sirna reads. the low r <dig> values suggest that there is no direct correlation between the convergent transcription of closely located genes and endo-sirnas. other parameters such as the length of the endo-sirna producing genes and their exon count had no influence on the number of endo-sirna reads .

to obtain a better estimate concerning the role of antisense transcripts in establishing the endo sirna signature we tested the classification of the  <dig> loci according to the antisense database natsdb . we found the sense/antisense  category over-represented in our dataset as compared to the overall distribution . the non-bidirectional gene category was reduced  whereas the bi-directionally transcribed but non-overlapping loci were represented equally in both datasets .

gene names and accession numbers were used as identifiers, however, a small number of genes  were not found in none of the three categories nbd, nob and sa. the right panel gives the proportion of single categories for all genes.

an intriguing observation was made related to genes in tail-to-tail orientation on the x chromosome. either such gene pairs were separated by substantial gaps  or they were located at chromosome ends in clusters with relaxed imprinting. this finding concurs with the documented reduced expression of antisense transcripts from the x chromosome and suggests that in a biologically relevant cellular context convergent transcription may be linked to epigenetic gene silencing.

we also assessed the expression levels of endo-sirna related genes using the natural antisense database   <cit> . since this repository does not contain information on hek <dig> cells, we used human kidney, brain and testes as references, instead. we tested the expression levels of probes that overlapped with endo-sirna reads. as reported elsewhere  <cit> , we found that sense transcripts were generally expressed at higher levels than antisense transcripts. interestingly, the endo-sirna producing transcripts are generally higher expressed than average, in both sense and antisense orientation . these data have to be considered with caution because hek cells may display variations in gene expression that are not reflected in renal tissue. on the other hand, the small inter-tissue variation suggests that the increased levels of expression are real –as one would expect based on the above established connection between endo-sirna and rnapii.

so far, we identified and characterized short rnas in differentiated hek <dig> cells which map to exons of protein coding genes. a significant number of endo-sirnas correlate with rnapii occupancy and ago <dig> clash signals. because sa loci are enriched in our dataset it is conceivable that convergent transcription contributes to the synthesis of these endo-sirnas.

effect of mutagenesis on endo-sirnas
in hek cells more than 12’ <dig> genes are expressed  <cit> , only  <dig> of which produce endo-sirnas. we wanted to investigate whether this endo-sirna signature may be characteristic for a specific cell stage or whether it is an unstable, transient feature. to address this question we subjected the original hek <dig> clone to random mutagenesis by ethyl methyl sulfonate  and immediately re-cloned the cells. two individual mutagenized clones were selected and used for rnaseq . a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million parsed reads was obtained from c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively; the data from the mother clone was included into the further analysis as a control. the reads were annotated to the human genome  and again categorized into “non genic” and “genic”, the latter group including mirnas, structural rnas  and exonic reads. in general, both mutagenized clones followed very similar trends regarding up –or down- regulation of specific rnas –in agreement with single allele point mutations induced by ems. an overview of the results for all three clones  is given in table  <dig>  the impact of ems mutagenesis on a genome wide level was established by assessing the variance of read numbers mapping to the individual genes. the pooled variance was taken as readout for the systemic consequences of the mutagenic insult. rnas involved in a tightly controlled network were expected show a small variance  whereas a highly redundant system would tolerate a large variance .

the categories in bold are further investigated in this project.

the most prevalent of the genic short rnas in both control and mutagenized samples were micrornas, which is in agreement with published short rnaseq data. hsa-mirs 10a/b,  <dig> and 92a-1/92a- <dig> made up more than 60% of all mirna reads. in total,  <dig> different mirnas scored higher than  <dig> reads in the control hek <dig> cells and these were further examined. the mirna expression pattern proved resistant towards mutagenic insults showing a pooled variance of  <dig>   . in both mutagenized clones  <dig>  and 87% of the genes showed less than 2-fold expression changes.

a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   million reads mapped to  <dig> different structural rnas, predominantly snornas. in contrast to the stable mirna transcriptome, the reads mapping to small structural rnas showed considerable pooled variance of  <dig>  in the mutagenized samples. interestingly, the vast majority of the structural genes were down regulated , only  <dig>  and  <dig> % remained stably expressed .

the endo-sirnas from the mutated samples were mapped and the pattern was compared to the control sample .  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads of 16- <dig> bases were identified and shown to have comparable length distribution as the wild type . strikingly, we found a near perfect match of genes with annotated reads in all three samples. the pooled variance of all endo-sirna reads in c <dig> and c <dig> was  <dig>  . in the two mutated clones comparable numbers of genes were significantly affected .

to test whether the changes in short rna abundance influenced mrna levels of the relevant genes we assessed the stable output of  <dig> loci by rt-qpcr. we selected loci that displayed clear changes in short rna read numbers in both sense and antisense orientation and also quantified the output from the neighboring genes. the results are presented in figure  <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig>  most of these genes were found to be expressed at a significant level  but the occurrence of endo-sirnas was not related to their steady state expression level. we also tested the half-life of  <dig> selected mrnas  and found no differences between the three clones .

to conclude, we have identified a layer of genic endo-sirnas related to ago <dig> and rnapii occupancy. experimental evidence suggests that convergent sense-antisense transcription contributes to the synthesis of these endo-sirnas. the endo-sirna signature is largely unaffected by mutagenic perturbation and does not reflect the level of the parent mrnas. because only about 2% of all expressed genes in hek cells contribute to the rna signature these endo-sirnas are therefore unlikely to be a direct byproduct of transcription. our observations suggest endo-sirnas to have a biological role and add significance to recent rna sequencing projects which report increasingly complex layers of low abundance short rnas.

discussion
we present a comprehensive characterization of genic short rnas in the human kidney cell line hek <dig>  we found that only a limited number of genes give rise to short rnas, predominantly endo-sirnas that are associated with ago <dig> and correlate with rnapii occupancy at 5′ends of genes. this rna signature does not scale with the transcription of the related gene and expression level of the mrna. moreover, the short rna pattern is resistant to mutagenic insults indicating that the endo-sirnas are the result of a controlled synthesis –or the byproduct of a controlled process.

three possibilities how these endo-sirnas are being produced are plausible and not mutually exclusive. first, rnapii produces a variety of rna by-products, related to pausing of the enzyme during initiation and termination of transcription or as a consequence of incomplete splicing  <cit> . the most prominent of the short rna species are denoted “promoter-associated small rnas”  and “transcription initiation rnas   <cit> . their occurrence is linked to highly active promoters and does not appear to involve rna interference since they are either capped  or do not co-precipitate with argonaute . tirnas are hypothesized to be generated by the backtracking rna polymerase and the action of an intrinsic endonuclease activity  <cit> . the fact that the short rnas identified in this screen show a very restricted expression pattern and do not scale with rnapii occupancy genome-wide suggests that the rna signature is not an obligatory by-product of transcription.

second, the reads could represent degradation products from cellular mrnas and reflect physiological mrna turnover. several observations, however, argue against this hypothesis. only about 1-2% of genes produce short rnas whereas roughly 40-50% of mrnas generate positive calls in expression analysis. moreover, careful expression analysis of  <dig> gene clusters, genes producing short rnas and its neighbors , showed no correlation between mrna levels and short rna reads. on the other hand, we identified genes where a very low number of randomly distributed reads could well be explained by rna breakdown or sequencing errors, these were not studied in further detail. the reproducibility of the endo-sirna signature after mutagenesis, however, suggests that such random errors do not contribute significantly to the sequencing output.

third, the short rnas identified in this screen could be synthesized by components of the rnai machinery. nuclear localization of key components such as dicer, drosha and argonaute proteins and shuttling of related rna protein complexes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus has been reported  <cit> . our results from the ago <dig> clash experiments and also the length profile of the short rnas suggest that the rnaseq reads are significantly constituted of endo-sirnas. at what stage a double stranded rna precursor is formed and dicing occurs, is yet unknown.

one particular focus of the presented work was to investigate a potential link between convergent transcription, i.e. the co-expression of sense and antisense transcripts, and the formation of endo-sirnas. genic endo-sirnas have been documented in several systems, predominantly in c. elegans, drosophila and also in mouse  <cit> . however, in mammalian systems, the link between convergent transcription and rna interference is controversial  <cit> . our results confirm the existence of endo-sirnas in human cells and the fact that 53% of these derive from sa loci provides circumstantial evidence that sense/antisense transcription may be involved. our observation, that genes on the x chromosome tend to avoid the possibility of convergent transcription, indicates that situations of convergent transcription may indeed exist in somatic, diploid cells.

there is a substantial body of evidence that sirnas can promote both transcriptional silencing and activation through chromatin modifications  <cit> . the sirnas used in those experiments were synthesized in vitro and applied at high concentrations indicating that the process was inefficient. our findings also suggests that the cell culture model used may not express balanced levels of all the components essential for the processing of nats into endo-sirnas and transcriptional silencing. for example, hela cells transfected with vectors expressing both thymidylate synthase  sense and antisense transcripts failed to generate ts related sirnas  <cit> . on the other hand, highly expressed convergent transcripts from a single plasmid were recently demonstrated to produce sirnas which induced transcriptional gene silencing in trans <cit> . our findings support the conclusion that the production of endo-sirnas from nats is inefficient in hek <dig> cells and probably in other cell culture models as well. indeed, the genome wide studies suggest that nats-linked endo-sirna processing is a highly cell-specific process, for example in developing sperm cells where antisense transcripts and endo-sirnas are prominently found  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in hek <dig> cells convergent transcription may trigger the production of endo-sirnas; however, the process appears to be rather inefficient and only relevant in specialized cell types. moreover, in depth analysis of genic short rnas revealed two interesting and novel features of the transcriptome: firstly, we identified a distinct endo-sirna signature that maps to a restricted number of genes and remains largely stable after a mutagenic insult. secondly, read numbers of endo-srnas do not reflect steady-state mrna levels of their parent genes.
