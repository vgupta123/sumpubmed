BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion, division, regulated movement, quality control, and interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum, have been characterized largely in yeast and cultured mammalian cells . studies in specialized cell types with high energy needs in other organisms, such as neurons and sperm in drosophila melanogaster, also provided early and ongoing insight into molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial shaping  <cit> . drosophila spermatogenesis involves a concerted developmentally-controlled program of specialized mitochondrial morphogenesis and thus is an ideal system for exploring molecular underpinnings. mitochondria aggregate during and after male meiosis, subsequently fusing dramatically into two giant mitochondrial derivatives that interdigitate in layers at the early round spermatid stage to generate a large, onion-like, layered spherical structure called the nebenkern . during subsequent spermatid elongation stages, the mitochondrial derivatives within the nebenkern unfurl and elongate beside the growing flagellar axoneme. testis-enriched paralogs of more broadly-expressed genes  <cit>  are common and are often identified via genetic analysis as associated with these functions, since null mutations in the testis-enriched paralogs can result in male-sterile but adult-viable mutant phenotypes.

atp synthase is a large multi-protein complex, found in prokaryotes as well as in mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes, that catalyzes atp formation from adp and inorganic phosphate during cellular respiration and photosynthesis . in mitochondria, the atp synthase complex typically contains at least  <dig> subunits divided among the f <dig>  f <dig>  and peripheral stalk regions. the f <dig> portion extends into the mitochondrial matrix, physically attaching in two ways to the f <dig> portion, which is embedded in the inner membrane: via the f <dig> central stalk that allows rotation, and via the peripheral or stator stalk, which stabilizes the complex. the f <dig> portion rotates in response to proton movement down the gradient established by the electron transport chain, and the resulting torque and conformational changes in the f <dig> portion lead to atp formation. defects in the atp synthase complex in humans can lead to neuromuscular disorders  due to deficiencies in atp production and overall mitochondrial dysfunction.

as shown mainly in yeast and cultured mammalian cells, the positive membrane curvature at the tips of cristae in the inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated in part by higher-order dimerization and oligomerization of atp synthase complexes . these interactions are separable from the metabolic role of atp synthase, as some mutants with intact single atp synthase complexes that cannot dimerize have aberrant cristae structure but can still respire  <cit> . cryo-electron microscopy indicates that bovine and yeast atp synthase complex monomers induce 43° membrane curvature, and that the predicted dimer-induced membrane curvature of 86° matches observed values well  <cit> . tomography studies indeed show dimer ribbons corresponding with tight membrane curvature  <cit> .

a logical question is whether regulation of atp synthase higher-order structures helps to mediate variability in inner mitochondrial membrane conformation across cell types and different conditions. in drosophila spermatogenesis, the large mitochondrial derivatives of the nebenkern in early round spermatids do not have prominent cristae or sharp positive curvature of the inner mitochondrial membrane; instead the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes appear closely apposed across most of their area and parallel to each other in broad concentric circles of membranes reminiscent of an onion slice   <cit> . in this way, spermatid wild-type inner mitochondrial membranes resemble yeast inner mitochondrial membranes in cells deficient for atp synthase dimerization.

here we report a role for a tissue-specific isoform of atp synthase subunit d in mediating internal nebenkern structure within drosophila melanogaster spermatids. we also provide evidence that other tissue-specific atp synthase subunit paralogs help shape spermatid mitochondria. subunit d is a major part of the peripheral stalk that stabilizes the f <dig> and f <dig> portions of atp synthase as they rotate with respect to each other. subunit d was first described in mammalian mitochondrial atp synthase  <cit>  and later in yeast  <cit> . it is not found in bacterial or chloroplast atp synthase. in s. cerevisiae, subunit d is oriented with its amino terminus farthest from the membrane and the carboxy terminus oriented closer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, spanning the distance between the f <dig> and f <dig> portions; while it does not itself span the inner mitochondrial membrane, it interacts via multiple coiled-coil domains with the transmembrane subunit b of the peripheral stalk  <cit> . we identified an uncharacteristically large atp synthase subunit d paralog expressed in drosophila testes that is associated with internal nebenkern structure and that may act via alteration of atp synthase dimerization. our work establishes a connection between tissue-specific variants of atp synthase subunits and tissue-specific internal mitochondrial structure.

RESULTS
knon mutants show aberrant mitochondrial elongation during spermatogenesis and have faulty nebenkern internal structure
the knotted onions 1400) mutant allele of drosophila melanogaster was identified in a screen for recessive male-sterile mutations via mobilization of a marked p element  <cit> . subsequent exposure of the mutant chromosome to transposase yielded no revertants of male sterility out of over thirty independent strains that lost w
+-associated eye color, indicating that the spermatogenesis phenotype was likely not associated with an intact p element. males homozygous for knon
ms <dig> were viable but completely sterile and had no individualized, motile sperm. homozygous knon
ms <dig> females were completely viable and fertile. phase-contrast microscopy of live testis preparations from knon
ms <dig> males revealed a failure of the nebenkern to elongate beside the growing flagellar axoneme . to distinguish nebenkern-intrinsic  from nebenkern-extrinsic  sources of elongation failure, we analyzed testes from males double mutant for knon and the dynamin-related gtpase fuzzy onions, fzo, which is required for nebenkern-associated mitochondrial fusion  <cit> . we found that knon
ms1400
fzo
 <dig> double mutants exhibit the fzo phenotype, wherein many smaller, unfused mitochondria successfully elongate alongside the axoneme, although the elongation appeared to be slightly delayed. this bypass of the elongation defect  suggests that the knon primary defect may be faulty nebenkern structure at the onion stage that interferes with the ability of mitochondrial derivatives to unfurl for subsequent elongation. consistent with this idea, transmission electron microscopy  of knon

ms <dig>  showing a phenotype indistinguishable from knon
ms <dig> homozygotes. in contrast, dfbsc <dig>  <cit>  complemented knon
ms <dig>  together, the breakpoints of df7e and dfbsc <dig> defined the knon region as including two genes, sema2a and cg <dig>  <cit> . sema2a is expressed in many tissues  <cit>  and known to function in the nervous system  <cit> . flyatlas data indicate that cg <dig> is expressed highly in the testis and at near-zero levels in adult carcass  and all other tissues tested except larval fat body, in which the larval gonad is embedded  <cit> . modencode rnaseq data indicate that cg <dig> is expressed highly in wandering third instar larvae and adult males but not at all in adult females  <cit> , consistent with expression only in the male reproductive tract. together these data suggested cg <dig> as the best candidate for knon.

ms <dig>  transgenic male flies homozygous for knon
ms <dig> and carrying an exogenous copy of cg <dig> under its own regulatory regions were fertile and exhibited wild-type mitochondrial shaping and elongation during spermatogenesis . knocking down cg <dig> in the germline using the bam-gal <dig> driver  <cit>  and the pv <dig> cg <dig> rnai insertion from the vienna drosophila resource center  <cit>  resulted in sterile males with large unelongated masses of mitochondria at the base of each elongating post-meiotic spermatid, similar to the knon
ms <dig> phenotype . neither the rnai transgene alone nor the bam-gal <dig> transgene alone had any detectable effect on spermatogenesis or male fertility . we amplified and sequenced the coding region of cg <dig> from knon
ms <dig> homozygotes and found no difference compared to the reference sequence  <cit> , while an upstream region was not amplifiable in knon
ms <dig>  it is therefore likely that the knon
ms <dig> lesion is in an upstream regulatory region that was disrupted, possibly by p-element insertion and subsequent excision during the original mutant screen  <cit> .fig.  <dig> knon-gfp rescues the mutant phenotype and localizes to mitochondria in primary spermatocytes and post-meiotic spermatids. phase-contrast and paired fluorescence images of cells from testes of knon

mi <dig> males were fertile but at slightly reduced levels, giving rise to 85% as many progeny as wild-type males , and show incompletely penetrant mild mitochondrial elongation defects . males with knon
mi <dig> in trans to either df7e or knon

knon is a testis-enriched atpsynd paralog with large c-terminal extension and associates with spermatid mitochondria
the knon gene encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with an amino terminal region 32% identical and 50% similar to drosophila atpsynd , the broadly-expressed canonical d subunit of the atp synthase complex. subunit d is part of the peripheral  stalk connecting the f <dig> and f <dig> portions of the complex. knon, a testis-enriched paralog of subunit d, has  <dig> additional amino acids at its carboxy terminus beyond the region of homology. blastp and tblastn searches revealed that this c-terminal region was not homologous to other characterized gene products  <cit> . curiously, in this c-terminal region 28% of the residues are either glutamic acid or lysine, making it highly charged, and there are no predicted transmembrane domains or other motifs. the iupred tool  <cit>  predicts that most of this region is intrinsically unstructured.

knon-gfp expressed under the control of endogenous knon regulatory sequences rescued the mutant phenotype  and was associated with mitochondria during later stages of spermatogenesis . knon-gfp was not detectable in the apical testis, which contains the stem cell populations and mitotically proliferating spermatogonia. the protein was detectable starting in spermatocytes during chromosome condensation. the timing of transition from absence of knon-gfp to abundance was consistent with established patterns of transcription in primary spermatocytes  <cit> . knon-gfp co-localized with phase-dark mitochondria throughout spermatogenesis, associating with meiotic spindles, post-meiotic aggregating mitochondria, and nebenkerne in the onion stage. knon-gfp persisted on mitochondrial derivatives during and after mitochondrial elongation in elongated spermatid cysts. mature, individualized wild-type sperm also contained the protein.

exogenous expression of knon in flight muscle alters the ratio of atp synthase complex dimers to monomers but does not affect gross mitochondrial shaping or function
because the atp synthase d subunit is located at the interface of bound atp synthase complexes in a dimer, we hypothesized that the extended c-terminal domain of knon might favor the monomeric atp synthase configuration by a steric mechanism. to test whether incorporation of knon into atp synthase inhibits dimerization of the complex, we exogenously expressed full-length knon in flight muscle with the gal4-uas system  <cit>  and analyzed atp synthase complexes by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and immunoblotting.  we generated flies carrying the wild-type knon coding region, with or without a c-terminal gfp tag, downstream of the uas regulatory region, and crossed these to flies with the flight muscle act88f-gal <dig> driver. we confirmed by fluorescence microscopy robust act88f-gal4-induced knon-gfp expression in flight muscle . by bn-page and immunoblotting using an antibody specific for atp synthase subunit α, we examined the internal ratio of atp synthase dimers to monomers in flies with act88f-gal <dig> alone compared to act88f-gal <dig> driving knon expression from each of two independently-inserted uas-knon transgenes . quantification of band intensity indicated a statistically significant  shift toward monomers when knon is expressed, compared to a control. such a shift was not seen when we used the act88f-gal <dig> driver to drive rnai constructs knocking down the broadly-expressed atpsynd or atpsyng, though these conditions led to a more pronounced f <dig> band and a smear at lower molecular weights suggesting increased dissociation of the complex into f <dig> and f <dig> portions and subsequent degradation. to test whether exogenous knon would exert a stronger effect if less of the paralogous atpsynd was present, we simultaneously expressed knon and knocked down atpsynd; the shift toward atp synthase monomers was similar to expressing knon alone , although with the more pronounced lower molecular weight smear as seen in the knockdown alone. in each case, when knon was expressed in flight muscle, the bn-page immunoblot also showed bands slightly heavier than the typical monomer bands , perhaps indicating monomers of the atp synthase complex that incorporated knon  instead of atpsynd. while native gels do not allow for precise calculation of molecular mass from distance traveled, the position of the extra band could plausibly represent monomers with an extra  <dig> kd.fig.  <dig> knon expression in flight muscle alters atp synthase dimer:monomer ratio but not gross mitochondrial morphology. a immunoblot using anti-atp synthase α subunit antibodies on a bn-page gel of mitochondrial isolates from flight muscle of the indicated genotypes. the act88f-gal <dig> flight muscle driver was used as a control , as well as to drive exogenous knon  expression from two independent transgene insertions , rnai knockdown constructs of atp synthase subunits g  and d , or simultaneous exogenous cg <dig> expression and knockdown of atp synthase subunit d . dimer/monomer intensity ratios are indicated at bottom. expressing knon , either with or without concurrent knockdown of the broadly-expressed atpsynd, reduced the amount of atp synthase dimers relative to monomers and gave rise to detectable bands of slightly larger size  than the typical monomer bands. b quantification of dimer/monomer band intensity ratios from multiple biological replicates . error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. c-d confocal images of drosophila flight muscle from act88f-gal4; uas-mitogfp  flies and act88f-gal4; uas-mitogfp/uas-cg <dig> flies . scale bar 10 μm




to ask whether the knon-mediated shift toward more atp synthase monomers was associated with altered flight muscle mitochondrial morphology, we examined by confocal microscopy tissue from flies expressing knon in flight muscle along with a separate mitochondrially-targed gfp   <cit>  . the mitogfp localization was roughly similar between flies with and without exogenously expressed knon, suggesting no gross alteration in mitochondrial number or size. consistent with the lack of obvious effect on mitochondrial structure, flies expressing knon in flight muscle were viable and able to fly, though there may be subtle effects at the levels of tissue architecture and flight ability that our experiments did not detect.

other testis-enriched paralogs of atp synthase subunits diverged at different times within insect lineages and have roles in spermatid mitochondrial dynamics
in addition to subunit d, the d. melanogaster genome includes pairs of paralogs encoding atp synthase subunits f <dig>  b, and g , as well as ε and β   <cit> . expression data from modencode  <cit>  and flyatlas  <cit>  consistently indicate strong testis enrichment for one gene within each paralogous pair. similar to subunit d, for subunit f <dig> the testis-enriched predicted gene product  is significantly larger than that of the broadly-expressed paralog . conversely, for subunit b the testis-enriched predicted gene product  is significantly smaller than that of the broadly expressed paralog .

we searched other sequenced genomes and found that the genes encoding atp synthase subunits diverged into paralogous pairs at different times in insect lineages . maximum likelihood phylogeny analysis  confirmed that the proteins encoded by a given pair of paralogs across species clustered in two groups around each of the differentially expressed d. melanogaster paralogs. in each case, the grouping that included the d. melanogaster testis-enriched paralog showed a much higher per-site amino acid substitution rate , suggesting that they are evolving faster, consistent with previous observations  <cit> . for each subunit, the two paralogs were not in close proximity in the genome, and in no case was there synteny in their respective regions. for the paralogs encoding the atp synthase f <dig> subunit, the testis-enriched version lacks introns, consistent with retroduplication as a possible duplication mechanism  <cit> . for subunits b and g, the testis-enriched paralog contains introns but fewer than in the broadly-expressed version, consistent with a possible retroduplication mechanism involving alternatively spliced transcripts as the gene duplication source  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogeny and evolution of knon and other atp synthase subunit paralogs in insects. a the six atp synthase subunits encoded by two paralogs in d. melanogaster have widely varying phylogenetic origins, determined by comparisons among insect genome sequences  deposited in ncbi. circles indicate the most recent common ancestor that contained both paralogs. b testis-enriched subunits have acquired more amino acid substitutions relative to a recent outgroup than broadly expressed subunits. the testis-specific ortholog of each subunit was inferred based on sequence similarity to d. melanogaster orthologs, which were in all cases unambiguous. the average per-site amino acid substitution rate for each subunit type relative to the most recent outgroup of the gene duplication was calculated from a clustal omega alignment  <cit> . error bars indicate standard deviation among the species analyzed




inducing rnai knockdown of testis-specific atp synthase subunits f <dig> and g in the drosophila melanogaster testis using the bam-gal <dig> driver led to mitochondrial elongation defects similar to those seen in homozygous knon males , while knockdown of the broadly-expressed paralogs showed more subtle effects. conversely, knockdown of the more recently diverged testis-specific b subunit did not affect spermatogenesis, while the broadly-expressed subunit b appears to retain an essential role in mitochondrial shaping during spermatogenesis. in contrast to these results, testis knockdown of the sole ortholog of the atp synthase α subunit   <cit> , which is in the f <dig> portion and is crucial for atp synthesis, resulted in degenerating spermatid cysts filled with large, prominent vacuolar inclusions. in general, these results are consistent with the premise that the atp synthase complex controls high-level mitochondrial architecture in developing spermatids through a mechanism separable from atp synthesis.fig.  <dig> rnai knockdown of other atp synthase subunits in the testis. a-f

discussion
the knon atp synthase subunit d paralog is required for normal nebenkern morphology
we found a role for knon, an uncharacteristically large paralog of atp synthase subunit d, in internal shaping of mitochondrial membranes in the nebenkern during drosophila spermatogenesis. male flies lacking functional knon were sterile and showed unusual membrane curvature and faulty internal structure within the nebenkern , with subsequent entanglement of the two unfurling mitochondrial derivatives and aberrant mitochondrial elongation as the flagellar axoneme grows. simultaneously preventing mitochondrial fusion in a knon; fzo double mutant suppresses the knon single mutant elongation defect. this result indicates that the knon phenotype is due to the formation of an aberrant nebernkern structure that cannot elongate, rather than defects at later stages. knon is expressed only in the testis  <cit> , and the protein is detected on mitochondria from meiosis through spermatid elongation , consistent with the timing of dramatic mitochondrial membrane reorganization.

the effect of knon on mitochondrial shaping is likely at the level of mitochondrial dynamics and not resulting from respiratory deficiency, since 1) the mitochondrial membrane potential remains high in knon mutant spermatids; 2) other energy-requiring events of spermatid development, such as axoneme elongation and nuclear shaping, proceed; 3) disrupting atp synthesis by knocking down the sole atp synthase α subunit ortholog in the testis leads to tissue degeneration; and 4) in other systems, the effects of atp synthase on organelle morphology and respiration are separable  <cit> .

in many cell types, dimerization of atp synthase complexes with their axes at an angle of 86° is important for determining sharp positive curvature of the inner mitochondrial membrane at cristae tips. in the nebenkern, however, the majority of the inner mitochondrial membrane is closely apposed to the outer mitochondrial membrane and shows very shallow curvature. the unusual membrane configuration in the nebenkern represents accumulation of inner and outer membrane material that is subsequently needed during mitochondrial elongation  <cit> . we hypothesized that, normally, knon expression during spermiogenesis may inhibit or alter atp synthase dimerization to facilitate the more shallow curvature of the bulk of the inner mitochondrial membrane as the nebenkern forms. in knon mutant spermatids, because the broadly-expressed paralog of subunit d  is also expressed in the testis  <cit> , nebenkern membranes may show aberrant sharp curvature from atp synthase dimerization .fig.  <dig> model for alteration of atp synthase complex dimerization by knon. a schematic representation of atp synthase complex dimerization as mediated by various subunits in the peripheral stalk and f <dig> portion. b steric interactions of the large knon c termini might inhibit dimerization or enable dimerization at a shallower angle




effects of knon on atp synthase dimerization
in yeast and mammalian cells, atp synthase subunits e, g, and b are known to mediate dimerization of atp synthase complexes and contribute to the sharp curvature of inner mitochondrial membranes at cristae tips  <cit> . s. cerevisiae cells mutant for subunit e or subunit g, normally found in the membrane-embedded f <dig> portion of the complex, lack higher order atp synthase dimers and have onion-like mitochondrial structures, reminiscent of the fly nebenkern, that lack the tight inner membrane curvature normally found in cristae . subunit b in the peripheral stalk is also important for dimerization of the atp synthase complex, and it can homodimerize on its own  <cit> . in yeast with a truncated subunit b missing the transmembrane portion, no atp synthase dimers form, and inner mitochondrial membranes lack cristae  <cit> .

peripheral stalk components farther away from the membrane also contribute to atp synthase dimerization. subunit h , in the peripheral stalk, can homodimerize and stabilize dimers in yeast even if subunits e and g are missing  <cit> . cryo-electron microscopy of atp synthase dimers from the alga polytomella indicates that peripheral stalk components from adjacent atp synthase monomers intertwine at a position  <dig> angstroms away from the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit> , consistent with the positions of subunits d and h/f <dig>  the broadly-expressed d. melanogaster subunit d  has  <dig> amino acids and is expressed in all tissues, although at lower levels in testes  <cit> . orthologs in humans, mice, c. elegans, and budding yeast are similar in size, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. in contrast, knon has  <dig> amino acids as a result of a large c-terminal extension. the crystal structure of bovine subunit d suggests that its carboxy terminus extends from the middle of the peripheral stalk toward the membrane and embedded f <dig> portion  <cit> , consistent with the idea that knon’s extra large domain in that position may alter the interactions between atp synthase complex monomers.

exogenous expression of knon in flight muscle indeed reduces dimerization of atp synthase . expression of knon in the absence of testis-specific versions of subunits f <dig>  g, and b may not, however, allow for assembly dynamics of a full testis-specific atp synthase complex. we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that in wild-type spermatids, knon along with the other testis-specific paralogs may help mediate atp synthase dimerization at a shallower angle. dimerization of atp synthase complexes at a shallower angle has been seen in tetrahymena  <cit> . atp synthase dimerization in the testis is difficult to assess directly because of tissue heterogeneity and technical constraints.

truncated knonmi <dig> lacking the carboxy-terminal  <dig> amino acids is partially functional, suggesting that  <dig> amino acids , are sufficient for knon to perform its function when threshold levels of protein are present. these data are consistent with the carboxy-terminal extension either providing steric hindrance that blocks dimerization or promoting unique interactions that underlie dimerization at a different angle.

roles for other testis-enriched atp synthase paralogs in spermatid mitochondrial shaping, and implications of different divergence times
three other subunits of atp synthase in the peripheral stalk and/or at the putative dimerization interface , and two subunits in the f <dig> portion , appear to be encoded by broadly-expressed and testis-specific paralogs in the drosophila melanogaster genome. we showed via rnai knockdown experiments that the testis-specific paralogs of subunits f <dig> and g are required for proper nebenkern dynamics during spermatogenesis, and that these phenotypes differed from the outcome of disrupting atp synthesis via knockdown of the sole α subunit ortholog. the testis-enriched f <dig> subunit, like the knon subunit d, is larger than the broadly-expressed version, while the two g subunit paralogs are similar in size. the testis-enriched g subunit therefore might not provide a steric hindrance to dimerization of the complex but might instead promote assembly of the testis-enriched large d and f <dig> subunits into the complex, or promote interactions between adjacent atp synthase complexes at a shallower angle at the base of the peripheral stalk.

for subunit b, the rnai transgenic line targeting the testis-enriched paralog may not be sufficiently inducible to show an effect, or alternatively the testis-enriched subunit b might truly be not required for spermatid morphogenesis. consistent with our data, another group recently showed that knockdown of the broadly-expressed atpsynb results in male infertility and a lack of mature sperm, though they did not examine the mitochondrial phenotype  <cit> . dispensability of the testis-specific subunit b would be consistent with its relatively recent gene duplication , such that there has been less time for specialization of the two paralogs compared to the other paralogous pairs.

the mechanism of differential gene regulation between the paralogs of peripheral stalk atp synthase subunits is unknown. notably, the paralogous atp synthase β subunits were duplicated earlier than the others, and a recent study showed that the broadly-expressed drosophila atpsynβ is normally repressed in germ cells by the hairpin rna pathway  <cit> . derepression of atpsynβ via knockout of the appropriate hprna causes defects in germ cell differentiation and male sterility  <cit> . these findings suggest that the atpsynβ paralogs have functionally diverged and have evolved rna-based regulatory mechanisms to favor the expression of one paralog over the other in the testis. the mechanisms of regulation of the other paralogous pairs are yet to be determined.

atp synthase, mitochondrial shaping, and tissue differentiation
in mammalian systems the ultrastructural organization of the inner mitochondrial membrane can vary among tissue types and in response to metabolic state or developmental cues . expression of subunit e, important for dimerization, can be triggered by altered nutrient and oxygen levels  <cit> . in differentiating cardiomyocytes, mitochondria undergo structural changes concomitant with atp synthase dimer stabilization by an accessory factor  <cit> . in the syncytiotrophoblast outer layer of the placenta, reduced atp synthase dimerization accompanies a lack of cristae, despite normal atp production  <cit> . specific mutations in the mitochondrially-encoded atp <dig> subunit found in leigh syndrome patients are associated with higher levels of atp synthase dimerization and decreased turnover of the complex  <cit> .

the drosophila ovary requires broadly-expressed atp synthase components for germ cell differentiation  <cit> , possibly associated with mitochondrial morphology and not respiration, because knockdowns of other respiratory complexes did not show the same effect. germline-specific atp synthase subunits in c. elegans appear required for tissue differentiation  <cit> , though no mitochondrial structural aspects were examined. in trypanosomes, different atp synthase subunit c paralogs are encoded in the genome; it is not yet known whether these gene products influence mitochondrial function and morphology in different life cycle stages  <cit> , though subunit c is not positioned to influence dimerization of the complex directly. our findings in the drosophila testis therefore elucidate the first known instance in which tissue-specific atp synthase subunits underlie tissue-specific regulation of mitochondrial shaping.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe the first evidence connecting tissue-specific mitochondrial shaping with the expression and function of tissue-specific atp synthase subunits. a testis-specific variant of atp synthase subunit d in drosophila is required for nebenkern morphology and appears to alter dimerization of atp synthase complexes. testis-specific paralogs of other atp synthase subunits also appear to have a role. our data, showing the role of a cell biological process in the context of tissue morphogenesis, contribute to the growing knowledge of atp synthase’s role in mediating membrane conformation, beyond its canonical role in atp production. future work with tissue-specific atp synthase subunit paralogs in drosophila may explore their sub-mitochondrial localization to test localization in areas of shallower inner mitochondrial membrane curvature; further work should also explore whether the testis-specific paralogs together form a unique complex, and whether individual subunits can be substituted between the different forms of the complex.
