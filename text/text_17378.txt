BACKGROUND
the eutherian y chromosome was originally homologous to the x chromosome  <cit> . since the acquisition of the sex-determining loci, however, the y has progressively degenerated due to suppression of recombination with the x. in the early stages of sex-chromosome differentiation, it is suggested that interactions between sex-determining genes and sexually antagonistic genes can drive selection for reduced recombination via gradual reduction of crossover frequencies, due to the spread of genetic modifiers of recombination rates and/or chromosome rearrangements such as inversions  <cit> . a lack of recombination results in accumulation of more deleterious substitutions relative to recombining regions, ultimately leading to deletion of non-functional dna segments from the y chromosome  <cit> .

sex chromosomes have evolved independently many times from different autosomes in different lineages  <cit> . in each lineage, different features are associated with sex-chromosome evolution. drosophila lacks recombination during male meiosis, so they have completely differentiated and largely degenerated y chromosomes  <cit> . the sex chromosomes of some fishes and plants have not evolved large non-recombining regions because their independently- and repeatedly-formed sex chromosomes have not had time for recombination to be suppressed or as a consequence of extensive ongoing recombination along the most region of sex chromosomes over long periods of time, as also illustrated by the sex chromosomes of palaeognathous birds . in contrast, most eutherians have evolved largely degenerated y chromosomes with the minute homologous region known as the pseudoautosomal region , which derived from an autosomal pair fused to the sex chromosomes in eutherian ancestor  <cit> . in eutherian, chiasma formation between x and y chromosomes in the par are essential for the correct segregation of the sex chromosomes in male meiosis  <cit> . obligate crossing over in the minute par results in an extremely high recombination rate in the region relative to other genomic region, and the high frequency of meiotic recombination is expected to cause an increase in g + c content within par through gc-biased gene conversion   <cit> . previous studies suggest that the rapid progression of y gene decay occurred shortly after the initiation of the sex chromosome differentiation in eutherian  <cit> . therefore, the eutherian sex chromosomes might diverge largely because of not only their ancient origin, but also an unrecognized mechanism that accelerates y degeneration. it is needed to understand the both processes of recombination suppression and par formation during early sex chromosome differentiation for revealing the eutherian-specific feature in y degeneration. however, it remains unknown when and how par is formed in the sex chromosomes. sex chromosomes of most of the highly diverged extant eutherian species are too ancient to address this issue. by contrast, the neo-sex chromosomes generated by sex-autosome fusions of recent origin are expected to be evolutionarily young. therefore, such neo-sex chromosomes provide a good model in which to elucidate the early phases of eutherian-specific sex chromosome evolution.

the okinawa spiny rat  has neo-sex chromosomes formed by sex-autosome fusions and is therefore an excellent model for studies of the initiation process of sex chromosome differentiation  <cit> . cross-species fluorescence in situ hybridization  has revealed that a pair of autosomes fused with the sex chromosomes of t. muenninki , which are homologous to segments of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of mouse  <cit> . the neo-sex chromosomes of t. muenninki correspond to autosomes in the two other tokudaia species, tokudaia tokunoshimensis and tokudaia osimensis  <cit> , indicating that the sex-autosome fusions occurred independently in the t. muenninki lineage after it diverged from the last common tokudaia ancestor. on the basis of the sequence data for mitochondrial cytochrome b  and nuclear recombination activating gene  <dig> , divergence times between t. muenninki and the two other species are estimated to be around  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  million years ago   and  <dig>   per  <dig> my;  <cit> ), suggesting that autosomes fused to sex chromosomes at  <dig> – <dig>  mya or more recently. t. muenninki  is the only species in the genus tokudaia that has maintained the y chromosome, probably through fusion with an autosome  <cit> . the short and long arms of their x chromosome  consisted of autosome  and ancestral x, respectively, and the x chromosome had a large centromeric heterochromatin  <cit> . the short arm of y chromosome  consisted of autosome  in almost region and minute ancestral y at the pericentromeric region, and the long arm of y chromosome  was heterochromatic region including many sry pseudogenes  <cit> . the other two spiny rats lost the whole y chromosome, except for a small region translocated to a single x chromosome in males and females  <cit> .

in the study described here, we applied molecular cytogenetic and genetic approaches to reveal the processes of par formation and recombination suppression during early-stage evolution of eutherian sex chromosomes, using t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes as a model. first, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization  in a t. muenninki male to examine loci order in the neo-x and neo-y chromosomes, as well as identify their chromosomal rearrangements. to estimate recombination rates along the neo-sex chromosome, the fine approach is to construct a genetic map by genotyping, with a high density of markers and a large number of unrelated individuals  <cit> . in single-sperm typing and genetic maps of three-generation families, male and sex-specific recombination rates also can be estimated, respectively. however, it is difficult to correct sufficient samples for estimating recombination rates by above analysis because t. muenninki is endangered and has been protected by the japanese government as a natural treasure since  <dig>  therefore, we detected variations in g + c content, which is positively correlated with recombination activity  <cit> , by substitution-direction analysis using  <dig> gene sequences from the peritelomeric, middle, and pericentromeric regions of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes, to reveal recombination activity in different chromosomal locations. we also studied male-specific substitutions to identify the genetically diverged region between the neo-x and neo-y, using partial sequences of  <dig> genes on three different regions of the neo-sex chromosomes. furthermore, we determined the neo-x– and neo-y–linked sequences of  <dig> genes to elucidate the processes underlying their genetic differentiation. in this study, we show that recombination have been suppressed in the pericentromeric region while recombination have been activated in the peritelomeric region of neo-sex chromosomes, indicating par might have evolved during the early stage of sex chromosome differentiation.

RESULTS
conserved synteny between neo-sex chromosomes
we performed two- and three-color fish mapping, using bacterial artificial chromosome  clones of t. muenninki as probes, to confirm conserved synteny between their neo-sex chromosomes and the corresponding autosomes of mouse and rat. bac clones used for fish were screened based on genome information from mouse and rat, using as a reference the neo-sex–linked genes we identified in a previous study  <cit> . sixteen, ten, and twenty four bac clones were mapped to the peritelomeric, middle, and pericentromeric regions of both t. muenninki neo-x and neo-y, respectively, as inferred from the genomes of the two other rodents . the neo-sex chromosomes were homologous to mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and to rat chromosome  <dig> . bac fish revealed no distinct chromosome rearrangements between the neo-sex chromosomes and rat chromosome  <dig> .fig.  <dig> two- and three-color fish mapping of dapi-stained chromosomes of a male t. muenninki. fitc-avidin – and rhodamine-dig –labeled bac dna probes were used. scale bar indicates 10 μm. arrowheads indicate the locations of each bac clone. eleven genes, gemin <dig> and foxk <dig> , doc2b and uts2r , prpf <dig> and actg <dig> , sstr <dig> and nde <dig> , emp <dig>  lmf <dig>  and myh <dig>  were mapped on t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes.  comparative cytogenetic maps from short arms of t. muenninki sex chromosomes , mouse chromosome  <dig> , and rat chromosome  <dig> . the locations and order of the genes are shown on the side of each chromosome. the location of genes with asterisk and ideograms of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes were taken from murata et al. . the gene order and ideogram of mmu  <dig> and rno  <dig> was taken from the ncbi database 



substitution bias associated with g + c content in neo-sex chromosomes
we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gene sequences located in the peritelomeric, middle, and pericentromeric regions of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes, respectively, from de novo assembled bac sequences by performing the exon-intron definition based on the mapped read sequences to the mouse genome . frameshifts were found in four genes on the neo-sex chromosomes , and the coding sequences of these genes were excluded from the following substitution-direction analysis.

to detect the variation in recombination frequency of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes, we estimated the g + c content in each of the three regions of the neo-sex chromosomes, which is positively correlated with recombination activity  <cit> . we also estimated the frequency of nucleotide substitutions associated with the g + c content in the neo-sex chromosomes comparing to the corresponding autosomes in mouse and rat, which are the most closely related species to t. muenninki among the species with sufficient sequence data available for the analysis. noncoding sites and third codon positions of coding sites, which are not generally subject to strong purifying selection, were used in this analysis. the mutation direction of each substitution was inferred in each species relative to the homolog nucleotide site in the other two species by the maximum parsimony principle. in the result, the g + c content was higher in the peritelomeric region and slightly lower in the pericentromeric region of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes than in the corresponding autosomal regions from mouse and rat . nucleotide substitutions at both the coding and noncoding sites were strongly biased toward a/t → g/c substitutions in the concatenated gene sequences from the peritelomeric region, but toward g/c → a/t substitutions in the pericentromeric region of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes . this substitution bias was also observed in the separated gene sequences from each region . by contrast, this strong bias in substitution direction was not detected in the middle region of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes or in any region of rat and mouse autosomes . these results showed that the sequence evolution toward gc-richness and at-richness had occurred in the peritelomeric and pericentromeric regions, respectively, through the strong substitution bias. in this analysis, the frequency of substitution direction in rat may be effected by some nucleotide substitutions occurred in the common ancestor of mouse and t. muenninki. therefore, we also performed the substitution-direction analysis among t. muenninki, mouse, and rat with guinea pig as outgroup to compare t. muenninki with rat more properly . this result also showed the sequence evolution toward gc- and at-richness in the peritelomeric and pericentromeric region of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes, respectively.table  <dig> comparison of g + c content and nucleotide substitution frequency in three regions among t. muenninki, mouse, and rat

we then inferred the substitution directions at all noncoding sites preceded by c or followed by g in three species to exclude the influence of dna methylation on g + c content in the peritelomeric and pericentromeric regions of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes. the total rate of cpg → tpg and cpg → cpa substitutions due to deamination of 5-methyl-cytosine in methylated cpg pairs is estimated to be more than  <dig> times higher than those of other transitions  <cit> . the total frequency of cpg → tpg and cpg → cpa substitution was only 3– <dig>  % lower in the peritelomeric region and  <dig> – <dig>  % higher in the pericentromeric region in t. muenninki than in the corresponding autosomal regions of mouse and rat .

genetic differentiation between the pericentromeric regions of neo-sex chromosomes
we detected the male-specific substitutions to reveal the genetically diverged regions between neo-sex chromosomes by pcr and direct sequencing using genomic dna from two-to-six males and four females. we found  <dig> male-specific substitutions and four indels in eleven of twelve partial gene sequences from the pericentromeric region, but no male-specific substitutions in all  <dig> partial gene sequences from the peritelomeric and middle regions . each neo-sex chromosome-derived bac clone was screened based on the inferred neo-x and neo-y alleles described in additional file 1: table s <dig> to confirm the degree of genetic divergence between the neo-x and neo-y. the open reading frames  of  <dig> genes studied were conserved on both neo-sex chromosomes except for txndc <dig>  although the complete orf sequences were not determined in three genes. the neo-y–linked sequence of txndc <dig> contains the frameshift generated by a single base insertion, whereas its neo-x homolog does not . although neo-x derived bac clone sequences did not be determined in prm <dig> and cpped <dig>  detection of male-specific substitutions revealed that the frameshift mutations occurred in these genes as well as txndc <dig> in one allele of male .

the evolutionary rate was significantly higher in the neo-y than the neo-x in the combined nucleotide sequences of all genes excluding txndc <dig>  as well as in the noncoding sequences of all genes, comparing to mouse orthologues . the ratios of non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates  for the combined  <dig> genes were estimated to reveal the variation in selection pressure on neo-y genes using “free-ratio” model, which assumes a different dn/ds ratio for each branch. we observed that dn/ds ratio was  <dig>  times higher in the neo-y branch than neo-x branch, and the significant difference between neo-x and neo-y branches was shown by likelihood ratio test . furthermore, the neo-y branch has significantly higher dn/ds ratio than other branches, while no significant difference was found between the neo-x and other branches .fig.  <dig> sequence evolution of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes. a nucleotide sequence evolution in the coding sites of  <dig> combined genes. b nucleotide sequence evolution in the noncoding sites of  <dig> combined genes. equality of the evolutionary rate between the neo-x and neo-y was rejected based on a chi-squared test, and an accelerated rate of evolution in the neo-y was demonstrated in both coding and noncoding sites. subs: substitutions. c maximum likelihood tree of the coding sequences of  <dig> combined genes. numbers above and under branches refer to dn/ds ratios and maximum-likelihood bootstrap percentage , respectively. the free-ratio model is used, which assumes a different dn/ds ratio for each branch in the tree. ds: synonymous substitution rate; dn: non-synonymous substitution rate; spiny rat: t. muenninki; mouse: m. musculus; rat: r. norvegicus




as an additional analysis of substitution spectrum in the genetically diverged regions between neo-sex chromosomes, we estimated the frequencies of substitution directions in each neo-sex–derived noncoding sequence to distinguish between the neo-x and neo-y by comparing with mouse sequence. sequence evolution toward at-richness was observed in both neo-x and neo-y, although it was more pronounced on the neo-y than the neo-x .

discussion
in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , our fish analysis detected no visible inversion and deletion between the neo-x and neo-y in t. muenninki . however, it remains the possibility of small rearrangements between them. the determination of the complete genomic sequence from each neo-x and neo-y in the recombination suppressed region is needed to exclude the possibility. fish analysis also showed the existence of homologous segment of mouse chr.  <dig> as well as chr.  <dig> and  <dig> in t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes. the fluorescence signal of mouse chr.  <dig> probe on the neo-sex chromosomes would be too small to detect in zoo-fish analysis from our previous study  <cit> . it is hypothesized that a gradual reduction of crossover frequencies is due to the spread of genetic modifiers of recombination rates or to chromosome rearrangements such as inversions  <cit> . recombination-suppressed sex chromosomes with chromosome inversions were reported in eutherian lineages. in humans, an autosome fused to the x chromosome  in the eutherian ancestor has high homology with the ancestral chromosome from which it is derived, whereas most of the autosome fused to the y chromosome has genetically diverged from the xar and then degenerated via at least eight inversions, leaving only the minute distal parts that recombine with the xar during meiosis  <cit> . in black muntjac , recombination suppression due to a large autosomal inversion during the past  <dig>  million years has led to the formation of the neo-y diverged from the neo-x  <cit> . compared to their sex-chromosomal regions, t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes without distinct chromosome rearrangement are in a very early stage of sex-chromosome differentiation.

over the course of sequence evolution, gc-richness increased in the peritelomeric region and decreased in the pericentromeric region of the neo-sex chromosomes . g + c content is negatively correlated with the distance to telomeres  <cit> . however, distance from the telomere does not differ significantly between the three regions of t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes and the corresponding regions of rat chromosome  <dig> , suggesting that chromosomal location is not the cause of the specific substitution patterns in t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes. therefore, the sequence evolution toward gc- and at-richness in the peritelomeric and pericentromeric region of neo-sex chromosomes, respectively, must be a consequence of genomic evolution from autosomes to sex chromosomes specifically in t. muenninki lineage. in human and bovine, g + c content of various regions can be ranked as follows : par, autosomes, x chromosome, and y chromosome; this ranking corresponds to decreasing order of recombination activity  <cit> . this effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of gbgc, i.e., a nonreciprocal exchange of nucleotide sequence that is biased in favor of gc-alleles resulting from mismatch repair of heteroduplex dna formed during meiotic recombination  <cit> . gbgc is expected to occur predominantly in recombination hotspots with short lifespans and weak influences on substitution rate, suggesting that it could affect the evolution of base composition in mb-long genomic fragments, but not individual hotspots   <cit> . this agrees well with our observation that g + c content was altered in both coding and noncoding sites of most of the genes we analyzed in the peritelomeric and pericentromeric regions . we also observed sequence evolution toward at-richness in both neo-x and neo-y sequences from the pericentromeric regions that genetically diverged each other, and the bias toward at-richness was stronger on the neo-y than neo-x . in the pericentromeric region of neo-sex chromosome, recombination could be suppressed between neo-x and neo-y and limited between neo-x chromosomes during female meiosis. therefore, this region shows low recombination rate comparing to the corresponding autosomal region of other species and the other neo-x region recombining with neo-y, in which recombination occurs during both male and female meiosis. this evolutionary pattern can be explained by a low gbgc effect due to depression of recombination activity that involved in change from autosomal inheritance to sex-linked inheritance. variation in g + c content is also generated by other factors, such as large differences in the original g + c content or the dna methylation frequency of cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . however, the observed g + c variation in t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes cannot be explained by these two factors. changes toward gc-richness and at-richness were observed respectively in the peritelomeric region, which has high g + c content, and the pericentromeric region, which has low g + c content, relative to the corresponding autosomal regions in the two other species. there was little difference in the cpg → tpg/cpa substitution rate between t. muenninki and the other rodent species. therefore, it was suggested that the sequence evolution toward gc-richness resulted from the increased gbgc by acquisition of recombination activity in the peritelomeric region of the neo-sex chromosomes. to reveal the recombination activity along the neo-sex chromosome, we need to estimate recombination rates in different regions by substitution-direction analysis as well as other approaches such as construction of a genetic map by genotyping with a high density of markers and a large number of unrelated individuals, single-sperm typing, and genetic maps of three-generation families, if we could correct sufficient number of dna samples or fresh testis.

the lack of recombination results in accumulation of more substitutions on the y chromosome than the x chromosome due to muller’s ratchet, genetic hitchhiking, male-driven effects, positive selection, and/or relaxed purifying selection  <cit> . in the pericentromeric region that genetically diverged between neo-sex chromosomes, we observed higher substitution rates in the neo-y than neo-x , indicating that recombination had been suppressed in the pericentromeric region. we also observed higher dn/ds ratio in neo-y than neo-x lineage, suggesting that the neo-y–linked genes had experienced relaxed purifying selection and/or positive selection . consistent with this result, we detected the internal stop codon generated by the frameshift in the neo-y–linked sequence of txndc <dig>  but not the neo-x–linked sequence . we also revealed that the frameshift mutations in prm <dig> and cpped <dig> as well as txndc <dig> on the pericentromeric region were existed in one allele of all males , suggesting that the frameshift mutations were caused by neo-y degeneration in the three genes. further investigation is needed to identify factor accelerating the evolutionary rate on the neo-y.

our results suggested that the recombination was suppressed in the pericentromeric region of neo-sex chromosomes from any cause at least other than distinct chromosomal inversion . this region locates most closely to the ancestral sex chromosomes among the three neo-sex regions  <cit> , suggesting that recombination between the neo-x and neo-y was suppressed due to gradually spread of genetic modifiers of recombination rates from the ancestral y region to its neighboring region in the neo-y chromosomes. alternatively, it may be that the involvement of the heterochromatic arms is a prerequisite for recombination suppression, or can at least accelerate the process. in common mole-rat, cryptomys hottentotus natalensis and c. h. hottentotus, asynapsis of x <dig>  and y  occurs in 25 % of cells examined and that this involves their heterochromatic arms, while the sister taxon , which lacks these heterochromatic arms, displays complete synapsis of x <dig> and y in 100 % of cells examined  <cit> . the asynapsis between the x <dig> and the y leads to the absence of chiasma formation in this region, further emphasising that recombination is reduced between these chromosomes  <cit> . t. muenninki has an x chromosome containing a large pericentromeric heterochromatic region and a y chromosome with heterochromatin in the proximal region of the short arm as well as the entire long arm  <cit> . therefore, the involvement of pericentromeric heterochromatins in t. muenninki xp and yp may be prerequisite for recombination suppression, or can at least accelerate the process in their neo-sex chromosomes.

there is a significant difference between peritelomeric and middle regions in regard to the extent of sequence evolution toward gc-richness, of which both are recombining regions . the result suggested that recombination activity had already been limited in the peritelomeric region of almost homologous neo-sex chromosomes, although in this study we could not study the recombination in male meiosis because they are endangered and protected species. the par has conserved synteny among most eutherian species in which it has been identified  <cit> , suggesting that the par is formed during a very early stage of sex-chromosome differentiation. therefore, acquirement of recombination activity limited in the peritelomeric region of sex chromosomes may be one of the mechanism that accelerates y degeneration during a very early stage of sex chromosome differentiation in eutherian.

CONCLUSIONS
our research showed that recombination might have been suppressed and activated in the pericentromeric and peritelomeric region of almost homologous neo-sex chromosomes without distinct chromosome rearrangement in t. muenninki. we conclude that the par might have been formed independently of the spread of recombination suppression at the same time as the initiation of recombination suppression during an early stage of sex-chromosome differentiation . t. muenninki neo-sex chromosomes are excellent models for the very early stages of sex-chromosome differentiation, and further analysis of them should provide new insights into eutherian sex-chromosome evolution.fig.  <dig> evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. in the early stages of sex-chromosome differentiation, a putative par with recombination activity might have been formed prior to the spread of recombination suppression. red: ancestral x region; blue: ancestral y region; pink: neo-x region diverged from neo-y; sky blue: neo-y region diverged from neo-x; white: undifferentiated neo-sex chromosomal region; yellow: putative par. mya: million years ago
