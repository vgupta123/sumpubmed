BACKGROUND
a significant limitation in automated protein identification for high-throughput proteomics research is low discrimination between correct and incorrect peptide assignments obtained by database searches. recent studies show that prediction of ms/ms fragmentation intensities using the gas phase chemistry simulator in the massanalyzer software can achieve accurate results in database searches  <cit> . this simulation is based on kinetic methods, the known gas phase chemical mechanisms for peptide fragmentation  <cit> , and the mobile proton hypothesis  <cit> . we have shown that a comparison of the observed ms/ms spectra with these theoretical spectra improves peptide identification in the analysis of complex samples  <cit> .

as part of our overall goal to improve the simulator, we developed software  to evaluate individual fragment ions, and found specific cleavages where the software, based on the kinetic model, did not perform well  <cit> . in this paper, we focus on one such cleavage, namely that at the second peptide bond from the n-terminus, denoted here as the n <dig> bond. the simulator in the massanalyzer models only one cleavage mechanism for all peptide bonds. the dominant mechanism for peptide bond cleavage yields an oxazolonium product, where the carbonyl oxygen of the preceding peptide bond  attacks the back of the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond  <cit> . thus, the model is dominated by the parameters driving the large number of cleavages of this type across the whole peptide. however, we observed that the theoretical model under-predicts the intensities at the n <dig> cleavage site, suggesting that an additional mechanism may be operating. alternative chemistry at the n <dig> bond has been proposed, where the peptide amino terminus provides the attacking group to form a diketopiperazine product  <cit> .

methods
data preparation
our data is derived from a large shotgun proteomics dataset of an extract of the erythroleukemia cell line k <dig> grown in suspension as described in  <cit> , with protein profiling as described in  <cit> . briefly, gel filtration fractionated proteins were digested with 3% weight trypsin/weight sample in mg protein. peptides were analyzed by strong cation exchange followed by reverse phase chromatography, on an lcq mass spectrometer instrument. an important goal is to minimize false positive peptide identifications. to evaluate the results from machine learning algorithms, we needed a high confidence subset of the data, which we achieved through the following five criteria:

 <dig>  we required that each ms/ms yielded the same peptide sequence with two search programs, sequest and mascot, and that the overall similarity score against the theoretical spectrum was at least  <dig> . previous results showed that this threshold produced nearly complete separation of incorrect and correct assignments with standard peptide ms/ms, and allowed inclusion of cases that have low scores in mascot and sequest  <cit> . the proportions of over- and under-predicted cleavage products were comparable in both the full vs. reduced datasets . of the alternative ms/ms that yielded different peptide sequences, we selected the one with the highest sumscore. sumscore is a combination of sequest's xcorr and mascot's mowse scores; xcorr is approximately one-half of sumscore and mowse is approximately seven times sumscore  <cit> . although the original dataset contained replicate msms spectra, only the highest scoring exemplar of each peptide charge form was included in this analysis.

 <dig>  peptides with observed molecular weight below  <dig> dalton were removed, because search programs are notoriously inaccurate for such small peptides.

 <dig>  we removed weak spectra, defined in terms of the standard deviation  of the intensities of the fragment ions. a small sd  of the peptide ion intensities frequently leads to confusion of the noise ions for n <dig> ions.

 <dig>  to minimize the possibility that the n <dig> ion was produced by contamination of the ms/ms spectrum from a coeluting peptide, we required that the peptide sequence account for at least 90% of the total ion current of the ms/ms spectrum. we utilized the ms/ms feature recognition functions in the mae software to annotate the fragment ions by ion types, after removing noise ions and combining the isotopic ion clusters to one ion; cf  <cit> . fragment ion features were annotated using heuristic rules developed for manual analysis of ms/ms spectra. the misidentification rate is estimated at  <dig> %. these rules  are described in detail in  <cit> .

 <dig>  we considered only doubly charged ms/ms, due to the more straightforward interpretation of the chemistry at the n <dig> cleavage.

the resulting dataset consisted of  <dig>  ms/ms spectra, out of the original  <dig>  spectra. criteria  <dig> and  <dig> led to the greatest number of exclusions; criteria  <dig> and  <dig> had the least effect.

pre-processing of intensity information for further analysis
two types of fragment ions are generated by cleavage at the n <dig> bond of doubly charged parent ions :

 <dig>  neutral loss 

• a y+ <dig> ion from an mh2+ <dig> parent, which is observed in the middle m/z range of the ms/ms spectrum, where ion yields are high and show good reproducibility.

 <dig>  positive ion loss 

• large y+ <dig> ions from mh2+ <dig> parents

• small b2+ <dig> or a2+ <dig> ions from mh2+ <dig> parents + <dig> ions)

this study focuses on the neutral loss cases, because the products from the positive ion loss often are not observed, due to instrument mass biases for both large and small fragment ions. in addition, during manual analyses of data, we often noted large differences between the predicted and observed intensities of the doubly charged cleavage products of the second peptide bond. to confirm this observation in the full dataset, we tested if these differences were observed in other peptide bonds, by comparing the n <dig> cleavage with the n <dig> and n <dig>  in each case, intensities of dehydrated/deammoniated forms and their unmodified precursor were combined to produce a single metric for chemical activity of each site + <dig>  y+ <dig>  and y+ <dig>  a quantile-quantile  plot was used to look at the predicted vs. observed ratios between the simulated and observed fragment ions generated by cleavage at these sites. this graphical method to compare distributions should be approximately linear if the distributions  are the same. the theoretical intensities predicted by massanalyzer for the y+ <dig> and y+ <dig> ions vs. the observed ion intensities are shown in figures 1a and 1b, respectively.

evaluating cases where intensity is zero
the q-q plot showed the need for proper normalization when the observed and/or theoretical intensities are close to or equal to zero. such cases may arise if the overall intensity of the ms/ms spectrum is low. variation in the intensity of the fragmented peptide ion results in observing a different number of the theoretically possible ions. ions that are relatively low in intensity will be observed in ms/ms of the more intense parent ions, but will be hidden in the noise or may not be detected when the parent ion is lower in intensity. on the other hand, all these less likely products are generated by the kinetic model, where signal to noise ratio is high.

we looked for evidence that the zero observed intensity cases are due primarily to less intense spectra. in figure  <dig>  where we have programmatically replaced the zero observed value with a very small number, the cases with observed n <dig> =  <dig> have log theoretical values ranging from - <dig> to - <dig>  indicating that these are among the less intense fragment ions in the spectra. furthermore, when we exclude more spectra with overall low intensity, the number of these cases decreases. these properties are consistent with a detection problem, rather than with a variation in the gas phase chemistry. therefore, we did not include them in the final dataset, which excluded only an additional  <dig>  cases.

we kept those spectra for which both the observed and theoretical intensities are zero , because the two are in clear agreement and should be categorized as well-predicted. furthermore, the size of this subset did not change significantly when we excluded weaker spectra, and the parent ion intensity did not appear as an important classifier in the well-predicted classes. these cases were assigned an observed/theoretical  ratio of  <dig> , programmatically.

we classified each fragment ion to indicate whether the ion intensity was well-, over-, or under-predicted , based on the ratio between observed and theoretical values. we then built two data models: under-predicted vs. well-predicted, and over-predicted vs. well-predicted. the "zero issue" predominantly affects the over-predicted vs. well-predicted model. changing the threshold between over-predicted and well-predicted causes a significant shift in the number of cases classified as over- or well-predicted, whereas changing the under-predicted threshold only causes minor variations in the distribution of the under- and well-predicted classes. in addition, there were many more cases that were under-predicted, making it more difficult to discern clear patterns in the over-predicted vs. well-predicted model, than it is in the under-predicted vs. well-predicted model. the fact that our most significant results are with the under-predicted class is consistent with the need for an additional mechanism in the simulation for this site. for this reason, only results from the well-predicted vs. under-predicted model are described in detail in this paper.

attribute selection
we started with  <dig> attributes that delineate sequence determinants for the attributes of ms/ms spectra and the amino acid sequences of peptides, including all attributes defined in  <cit>  and additional attributes derived from the observed ms/ms spectra by mae, as described in  <cit> . this set includes attributes both from the sequence itself and from the feature recognition function in mae, as well as other features from the ms/ms spectrum. the  <dig> attributes are listed in table  <dig> 

as in most data mining applications, we need to identify which attributes of the full set are the key determinants to discriminate between the classes , so we can eliminate irrelevant and/or redundant features. we evaluated correlations among the attribute set and eliminated six redundant attributes including mowse, xcorr, sim, tsum, mobileh, and numions. sumscore is a combination of xcorr and mowse, so the latter two were removed; omw and the number of ions are highly correlated, so we kept omw; osum is correlated with tsum and sim, so we kept osum, because it is an observed measure as opposed to a theoretically derived measure. the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is correlated with mobileh. we kept the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond, because the final ms/ms dataset contained only doubly charged cases, which reduces the range of the mobileh feature.

attribute selection methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to simplify the subsequent task of model-building. determining which selection methods are best for a given data mining application is typically approached experimentally, because different selection algorithms yield varying results, and the results can vary dramatically with small changes in the dataset. we tested for consensus among several attribute selection algorithms using the open-source weka library  <cit> . for the under- vs. well-predicted subset, three attributes were never selected by any of the algorithms and thus could be eliminated as irrelevant . an additional four attributes were eliminated because they were classified as highly unlikely to provide any discriminatory power, due to the fact that they were selected by only one or two of the algorithms . twenty-five attributes remained.

we determined experimentally that the seven attributes which included the first five amino acids on the n-terminus and the last two amino acids on the c-terminus could be removed without loss of accuracy  in the under- vs. well-predicted data. furthermore, because these attributes represented nominal data, they could not be used in algorithms that require numeric data. the information was also well-represented by the basicity and hydrophobicity of the amino acid in each of the seven positions. we used the remaining  <dig> attributes for model building. five features with continuous values , were discretized using our class-attribute interdependence maximization  algorithm  <cit> . the caim, unlike most other discretization algorithms does not require the user to specify a priori the number of discrete intervals; instead it uses class information to calculate their number.

we first performed exploratory data analysis, then for model-building we used supervised methods , plus our own rule generating program, datasqueezer  <cit> .

RESULTS
exploratory data analysis
exploratory data analysis revealed some of the dominant findings used later in model building with decision trees, rule algorithms, and association rules. figures  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate the tendency of large peptides  and arginine in the n <dig> position to be well-predicted, respectively. exploratory analysis also revealed that glycine, leucine, and proline in the n <dig> position tend to be under-predicted. we generated a  <dig> ×  <dig> table of amino acids in the n <dig> position  followed by amino acids in the n <dig> position . each cell in the table held the median value of the observed to theoretical ratio when a given amino acid in n <dig> is followed by a given amino acid in n <dig>  we frequency-weighted the table to see patterns where the observed to theoretical ratio is unusually high especially compared with the same table charting the amino acids at the n <dig> bond . we observed that glycine, leucine, and proline in the n <dig> position are sequence determinants for under-prediction . the decision tree and association rules also revealed that proline in the n <dig> position was a sequence determinant for well-prediction .

in addition, we used robust linear regression to fit the logarithm of the ratio of observed intensities to theoretical intensities as a function of the  <dig> features using the robustfit function in matlab, which uses an iteratively re-weighted least squares algorithm, with the weights calculated at each iteration by applying the bisquare function to the residuals from the previous iteration  <cit> . the results are considerably less sensitive to outliers in the data as compared with ordinary least squares regression.  we compared the results of robust regression on the n <dig> dataset against control datasets that contain the same features as the n <dig> data but with observed and theoretical ions respectively measured and predicted at the n <dig> bond and at the n <dig> bond. we chose the n <dig> and n <dig> bond for comparison to n <dig> because we knew experimentally that n <dig> and n <dig> did not exhibit the same tendency to under-predict n <dig> and n <dig> ion intensities as occurred with those at the n <dig> site. figure  <dig> shows clearly that the distribution of intensities of the n <dig> ions differs from that of the n <dig> ions , indicating that at least one additional chemical mechanism is operating at the n <dig> bond, that is not currently addressed in the theoretical model.

model building
we used different approaches to validate the applicability of supervised and unsupervised techniques to proteomics data and to ensure our results reflected true chemical properties in the data. by and large all the methods were very consistent in their findings. figure  <dig> shows a decision tree generated for the under-predicted vs. well-predicted data. the dominant theme in the tree is that the decisions are made on the basis of the specific amino acids in the first, second, or third positions in the peptide sequence. this is also represented by the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond .

this model suggests several hypotheses:

 <dig>  if arginine is the first amino acid, then the n <dig> cleavage is well-predicted;

 <dig>  if:

a. arginine is not the first amino acid;

b. the second amino acid is not glycine, asparagine, histidine, proline, or lysine;

c. the third amino acid is not proline or lysine;

then the n <dig> cleavage is well-predicteded;

 <dig>  if:

a. arginine is not the first amino acid;

b. proline or lysine is in the third position;

then the n <dig> cleavage is well predicted;

 <dig>  if a peptide:

a. has a relatively short sequence;

b. does not have histidine, proline, lysine, or arginine in it's first position;

c. does not have proline or lysine in it's third position;

then it is under-predicted.

we generated many different decision trees using different thresholds on the observed to theoretical n <dig> ratio to define the well-predicted and under-predicted classes, different attribute subsets, and different parameters of the algorithm. although the decision trees were always different, some properties were invariant including:  two or more basic residues to the right of the n <dig> bond leads to well-prediction;  conversely, zero or one basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is an under-prediction indicator;  a small omw leads to under-prediction; and  the presence of basic amino acids, proline, or glycine in the second position is an indicator of under-prediction. peptides with a large omw tend to be well-predicted, because they are less likely to have the second mechanism in operation .

these results suggest that the second mechanism might be the generation of a diketopiperazine leaving group . this mechanism involves attack of the amino terminal amine on the back of the n <dig> carbonyl, producing a resonance stabilized six-member ring. the increased frequency of proline in the second position is consistent with the steric effects of proline in that position, which strongly favors the six-membered ring configuration. the diketopiperazine product should also be favoured when the amino terminus is uncharged, or when the n <dig> bond is less basic  <cit> ; these tendencies can be observed in the decision tree results. in addition, the number of ions  is highly correlated with omw; larger peptides in this dataset are more likely to produce good fragmentation at all peptide bonds, by the oxazolonium mechanism. this would reduce the amount of chemical energy available for the diketopiperazine mechanism.

the datasqueezer algorithm  <cit>  was used to generate prediction rules for the under-predicted vs. well-predicted data. only strong rules, those that cover at least 5%  and 3%  of the corresponding positive data from training data set, were generated. a larger threshold for the under-predicted class was used to accommodate the larger number of samples in this class. note that the order of attributes/rules does not indicate their importance.

machine learning rules for the under-predicted class 
 <dig>  if:

a. lysine is the second to last amino acid in the peptide sequence;

b. the number of arginine residues in the peptide sequence is zero;

c. the number of basic amino acids to the left of the n <dig> bond is zero;

d. number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is 1;

then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. arginine is the second to last amino acid in the peptide sequence;

b. the total number of arginines in the peptide sequence is 1;

c. number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is 1;

then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. omw is between  <dig> and 1950;

b. oyminusb is greater than or equal to - <dig> ;

c. interscore is between  <dig> and .16;

d. osum is between . <dig> and .98;

e. the number of basic amino acids to the left of the n <dig> bond is zero;

f. the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is 1;

then it is under-predicted.

machine learning rules for the well-predicted class 
 <dig>  if:

a. proline is the third amino acid in the peptide sequence;

b. arginine is the second to last amino acid in the peptide sequence;

c. the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is 1;

then it is well-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. arginine is the first amino acid in the peptide sequence;

b. lysine is second to last in the peptide sequence;

then it is well-predicted.

comparison of rules generated by the three machine learning approaches
the datasqueezer rules are consistent with the decision trees and association rules in several ways. in all three methods, determining strong rules for the well-predicted class was more difficult than for the under-predicted class, in part because the under-predicted class had more representation in terms of the number of instances . however, this is an acceptable outcome for the purposes of this study, because we are interested in describing the sequence determinants that lead to under-prediction in order to improve the model in that noticeably deficient area.

additionally, all three methods demonstrate several general chemical properties:  if only one basic residue lies to the right of the n <dig> bond, the peptide will be under-predicted in the current model;  small omw leads to under-prediction; and  arginine in the n <dig> position and/or proline in the n <dig> position facilitates a chemical mechanism that is currently well-modelled . although the first rule is difficult to explain, it may represent a higher rate of fragmentation by the oxazolonium mechanism in the bonds to the right of n <dig>  under those conditions. smaller peptides often show a larger effect of mechanisms other than the oxazolonium mechanism in their ms/ms spectrum, while a strong charged group in the n <dig> position favours the oxazolonium over the diketopiperazine because the n-terminal amine is more basic. the increased observation of proline in the third amino acid position is generally seen for proline at other positions as well; this is the basis of the so-called proline effect, where fragment ions produced by cleavage at the n-terminal side of a proline are often the most intense ions in an ms/ms spectrum.

the same data were analyzed using association rules  as implemented in weka, an unsupervised learning method. ars are useful for discovering correlations among underlying data. for example, an ar might be stated as: "70% of under-predicted ions also have a basic residue in the n <dig> position".

the strength of an ar is measured by the support for that rule , and by the confidence . ars require nominal data, which has been categorized, but where the order of the categories is arbitrary.

to compare results between the rule generating programs and the association rule program, we ran association rules as a classifier. in other words, we forced the consequent of the rule  to have only one member: a decision attribute. in all of the following association rules, the class is the consequent of the rule; that is, these are all rules for classifying under- or well-predicted peptides. 

ar rules for under-predicted cases
 <dig>  if omw is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  then it is well-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. omw is between  <dig>  and  <dig> ;

b. the total number of arginines in the peptide sequence is zero or one;

c. number of basic amino acides to the left of the n <dig> bond is zero;

then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if omw is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and arginine is not the first amino acid in the peptide sequence, then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if the number of basic amino acids to the left of the n <dig> bond is zero and the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is  <dig>  then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. omw is between  <dig>  and  <dig> ;

b. oyminusb is greater than - <dig> ;

c. the number of amino acids to the left of the n <dig> bond is zero;

then it is under-predicted.

 <dig>  if:

a. omw is between  <dig>  and  <dig> ;

b. oyminusb is greater than - <dig> ;

c. arginine is not the first amino acid in the peptide sequence;

then it is under-predicted.

ar rules for well-predicted cases
 <dig>  if the hydrophobicity of the third amino acid is - <dig> , then it is well-predicted.

 <dig>  if the basicity of the third amino acid is  <dig> , then it is well-predicted.

 <dig>  if the number of basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> bond is  <dig>  then it is under-predicted.

these rules generated by the unsupervised association rule algorithm are very similar to those implied by the decision trees and the datasqueezer rule algorithm. again, it is clear that a small observed molecular weight leads to under-prediction . the association rules also detected the importance of arginine is in the first amino acid position.

additional association rules also support a recurring theme; namely, with only zero or one basic residue  to the right of the n <dig> position, the peptide tends to be under-predicted. this finding is related to the mobile proton model  <cit> : the proton required to cleave the peptide bonds is relatively more free to move about the peptide when arginine is present. when present, arginine sequesters the proton to its side-chain, because it has a very high pka . if the overall number of protons on the peptide is equal to or less than the number of arginine residues, then protons are available only at local sites. this is most important when the charge on the peptide is equal to or less than the number of arginine residues. in that situation, cleavages are directed mostly by so-called charge-remote mechanisms catalyzed by a proton from the acidic side-chain of aspartate or glutamate. these effects can also occur locally, which probably is the situation in this case, where the n-terminus may be sterically isolated from the rest of the peptide.

the number of basic residues to the left and right of the n <dig> bond is clearly an important feature of the underlying chemistry. basic residues to the right of the fragmentation site tend to draw the protons and fragment in well-predicted or chemically well-behaved ways; but basic residues to the left of the n <dig> bond led to under-prediction. this finding is likely a consequence of our focus on only the neutral-loss cases , and inadequate modelling of the charge on the n-terminal amine by the zhang simulation, so that the neutral loss is under-predicted  <cit> . it may also be due to the difficulty of charging the n-terminus, with the consequence that the uncharged amine can form a stable six-member diketopiperazine with the carbonyl of the n <dig> bond  <cit> , leading to cleavage of the n <dig> bond.

association rules number one and two for well-predicted cases both capture the same relationship , that proline in the third amino acid position is associated with well-prediction. this relationship was observed also in exploratory data analysis, the decision tree, and the rule algorithm , and reflects the strong proline effect discussed above. the fact that all three approaches identified, in supervised and unsupervised methods, the strong proline effect gives reassurance that the features uncovered here may in fact be real and not spurious.

we tested the nine features identified by ars as the most important  using the datasqueezer classifier. with the nine features, datasqueezer generated  <dig> rules with  <dig> % true positives and  <dig> % false positives for the up class, and  <dig> rules with  <dig> % true positives and  <dig> % false positives for the wp class. these results were similar to results obtained with the eighteen attributers, with similar accuracies and true positive rates. this performance is impressive considering that only  <dig> attributes of the selected  <dig> were used. in fact, similar results are achieved with just omw, numhkr_rn <dig>  numhkr_ln <dig>  but provides little additional information about the underlying chemistry. the number of basic residues both to the right and left of the n <dig> bond is a general measure of the amino acid distribution and does not capture the effect of other amino acids like proline, leucine, and glycine.

CONCLUSIONS
the different methods that were used to analyze the data all generated similar results. importantly, the unsupervised method gave approximately the same results as the supervised methods. this consistency is compelling evidence for the identification of the underlying chemical mechanisms and that the overall analysis, using a combination of chemical knowledge, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms, is a valuable combination to apply in future studies. some relationships were indicated more strongly by some methods, confirming that data analysis from different perspectives is useful.

the exploratory data analysis and supervised and unsupervised data mining models elucidated the following pieces of new information/knowledge:

 <dig>  intensities of fragment ions for the n <dig> cleavage of large omw peptides are well-predicted.

 <dig>  lysine, proline, histidine, asparagine, glycine, or leucine, in the n <dig> position leads to under-prediction of the n <dig> cleavage.

 <dig>  basic amino  acids in the n <dig> or n <dig> position lead to under-prediction. arginine in the n <dig> position is a notable exception. this rule is the first split in the decision tree, and as such is a strong sequence determinant. however, this rule is likely influenced by the distribution of the other amino acids in the sequence. in other words, a peptide with arginine as the first amino acid will be well- or under-predicted depending on the distribution of basic residues to the right of the n <dig> bond as well.

 <dig>  the amino acids in the n <dig>  n <dig>  and n <dig> positions are key determinants.

 <dig>  the amino acids in the n <dig> position or further from the n <dig> bond do not play a role in theoretical prediction at the n <dig> site.

 <dig>  the distribution of basic residues in the sequence to the left and right of the n <dig> fragmentation site affect the theoretical prediction.

 <dig>  two or more basic amino acids to the right of the n <dig> site are well predicted; this could be due to the focus on neutral loss of the small product.

the characteristics of ms/ms spectra that cause significant deviations from predicted spectra will be used to improve the kinetic model for theoretical prediction. further study will be required to confirm our findings derived here from exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and to identify the best combination of analysis tools to reveal new chemical mechanisms. in addition, the analysis methods described in this study provide a reliable work flow for further studies analyzing the other poorly predicted aspects of the massanalyzer simulated spectra.
