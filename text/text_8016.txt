BACKGROUND
allergic asthma is a common childhood disease that often persists into adulthood. the prevalence of childhood allergic diseases has increased dramatically in recent decades in many parts of the world  <cit> , and children who mount an immune response to inhalant allergens have an increased risk of developing asthma. this immune response includes both ige antibodies and type  <dig> helper t  cells, which are thought to contribute to inflammation in the respiratory tract. moreover, sensitization to indoor allergens  is strongly associated with asthma. the allergic disorders and diseases are characterized by predominant th <dig> cytokine  production  <cit> .

ganoderma lucidum, a medicinal mushroom, is among the most popular herbal medicines in east asia. g. lucidum has been reported to be effective in modulating immune functions, inhibiting tumor growth, and in the treatment of chronic hepatopathy, hypertension, neoplasia, and hyperglycemia  <cit> . g. lucidum has also been used to prevent and treat atopic diseases in several mouse and human models  <cit> . the main functional components of g. lucidum include polysaccharides, proteins, peptides, amino acids, and triterpenes. polysaccharides are well-known for their immunomodulatory and anti-tumor functions  <cit>  by reportedly enhancing the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and increasing tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ release from macrophages and lymphocytes, respectively  <cit> . the polysaccharide component from g. lucidum  has also been reported to elicit anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils, which primarily depend on the activation of akt-regulated signaling pathways  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that ps-g can rapidly and effectively promote the activation and maturation of immature healthy human dendritic cells , and promote t helper  <dig> immune responses in mice, thereby suggesting that ps-g may possess a potential capacity for regulating immune responses  <cit> .

dendritic cells are powerful antigen-presenting cells, the primary function which is to capture, process, and present antigens to naïve t cells  <cit> . immature dcs reside in non-lymphoid tissues where dcs can capture and process antigens. fully-mature dcs have a high surface expression of major histocompatibility complex  class ii and co-stimulatory molecules , but a decreased capacity to internalize antigens  <cit> . the induction of dc maturation is critical for the induction of ag-specific t lymphocyte responses and may be essential for the development of human vaccines relying on t cell immunity. il- <dig> production is also an important marker for dc maturation and can be used to select th1-inducing adjuvants. il- <dig>  a cytokine that inhibits inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses  <cit> , has enormous potential for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. il- <dig>  which is mainly produced by macrophages and dcs  <cit> , was recently identified as a cytokine that induces il- <dig> expression  <cit> . il- <dig> production is enhanced in acute atopic dermatitis lesions  <cit>  and allergic contact dermatitis  <cit> .

the purpose of the current study was to determine the potential immune modifications that ps-g directly affects at the level of dcs in children with allergic asthma. the development of a defined t-cell profile is highly dependent on dc-stimulating factors, and the direct effect of ps-g on allergic md-dcs may underline its potential and natural regulatory activity by directing the development of allergic reactions.

RESULTS
der p 1-pulsed md-dcs increased maturation in the presence of ps-g
md-dcs displayed a mature cell phenotype similar to that of lps-stimulated dcs in the presence of ps-g, and was characterized by an increase in cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr expression  and a decrease in the cd1a marker . when ps-g was added to der p 1-stimulated md-dcs, the phenotypic profile was similar to that detected in dcs stimulated with ps-g alone.

ps-g decreased the endocytotic ability of mature md-dcs
immature dcs that capture and process antigens  lose the ability to take up antigen and become mature dcs  <cit> . the uptake of fitc-dextran has been shown to be maximal in immature human md-dcs through macro-pinocytosis and the mannose receptor  <cit> . to determine whether or not ps-g modulates the antigen uptake ability of md-dcs, fitc-dextran was analyzed by flow cytometry . lps and ps-g-treated md-dcs showed decreased fitc-dextran uptake compared to untreated control md-dcs and md-dcs treated with der p  <dig> alone. however, ps-g altered the phagocytic capacity of md-dcs with der p  <dig> alone.

ps-g increased il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production by dcs with der p  <dig> allergen
because il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> are known to play key roles in the modulation of t cell responses  <cit> , il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> produced by md-dcs pulsed only with der p  <dig>  ps-g, or both were evaluated. der p 1-pulsed dcs failed to secrete the production of il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in allergic asthmatic children , whereas the reactivity of dcs to der p  <dig> was very weak in allergic patients. in healthy donors, der p 1-pulsed dcs produced large amounts of il- <dig> p <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> .

interestingly, ps-g increased il- <dig> p <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> production in der p 1-pulsed dcs from allergic patients, while il- <dig> p <dig> levels remained similar to the il- <dig> p <dig> levels obtained in the absence of der p  <dig>  moreover, ps-g induced dose-dependent il- <dig> production, which remained at a similar level in the presence of der p  <dig>  ps-g also increased il- <dig> and il- <dig> production in md-dcs pulsed with der p  <dig> or ps-g alone. based on il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production, dc reactivity towards ps-g appeared to be equal in allergic patients and healthy donors, but there were high levels of il- <dig> p <dig> in healthy donors. thus, ps-g was shown to induce dcs from allergic patients to produce the pro-th <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  as observed in healthy donors.

ps-g decreased th <dig> cytokine production by cd4-naive t cells
the polarization of the primary autologous t cells induced by md-dcs was then examined. to evaluate the influence of ps-g on t-cell polarization, der p 1-pulsed md-dcs incubated with or without ps-g were further co-cultured with autogeneic naïve cd4+ t cells. the production of th <dig> cytokines , th <dig> cytokines , and th <dig> cytokines  were analyzed.

stimulation of naïve t cells from allergic patients with dcs pulsed only with ps-g, not only der p  <dig>  induced high ifn-γ production. the addition of ps-g to the der p stimulus significantly modified ifn-γ secretion . when autologous naïve cd4+t cells from allergic asthmatic children were incubated with der p 1-pulsed dcs, production of il- <dig> was observed; however, this production was significantly decreased in der p 1-pulsed dcs with ps-g . the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-17a were not significantly changed .

ps-g induced t-cell proliferation by der p 1-pulsed md-dcs
when naïve cd4+ t cells were co-cultured for  <dig> days with der p 1-pulsed md-dcs from children with allergic asthma, the proliferation of t cells was low compared to unpulsed dcs . the addition of ps-g to der p  <dig> induced a significant proliferation of t-cells similar to that observed with ps-g alone.

discussion
ganoderma lucidum  has been used for a long time in china and other asian countries to prevent and treat various human diseases. ganoderma lucidum has been the subject of modern pharmacologic and clinical research in the last  <dig> years, and is reportedly effective in promoting health and longevity, and enhancing the efficacy of treatment of many diseases. the main aim of this study was to determine the regulatory effect of ps-g on md-dcs from children with allergic asthma. the results showed that ps-g increased the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr molecules on the cell membranes of der p 1-pulsed md-dcs. even though the maturation markers of md-dcs from children with allergic asthma treated with ps-g alone increased, the effect was as clear as the effect in md-dcs treated with lps alone. taken together, ps-g or lps alone induces the maturation of md-dcs from allergic asthma patients, and lps- and ps-g-treated md-dcs showed decreased antigen processing compared to control md-dcs and md-dcs treated with der p  <dig> alone.

we also evaluated the production of cytokines  in md-dcs from allergic asthma children, and found that ps-g alone stimulated der p 1-pulsed dcs to secrete il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  and il- <dig>  the different responses of ps-g on dcs from healthy and allergic donors are particularly noteworthy. ps-g induced a large amount of il- <dig> p <dig> from healthy compared to atopic donors. il- <dig> is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. endogenous il-12p <dig> selectively inhibits ahr and airway remodeling in an asthma model with prolonged antigen exposure  <cit> . il-12b is located in this genomic region and encodes il-12p <dig>  <cit> ; however, the allelic effects of this polymorphism on asthma susceptibility and asthma-related phenotypes has been shown. the first report suggested that the heterozygous genotype was more frequently detected in children with severe asthma  <cit> . the genetic variation in the promoter of il-12b displays functional activity and cytokine production capacity.

we also showed that the amount of il- <dig> produced by ps-g on dcs from healthy donors was higher than allergic donors . the p <dig> subunit of il- <dig> is shared by il- <dig>  a cytokine with actions similar to, but distinct from il- <dig>  <cit> . a protective role for the th <dig> response generated by il-12/il- <dig> has been suggested based on infectious diseases in children with genetic defects of the il-12/ <dig> - ifn-γ circuit  <cit> .

ps-g-induced il- <dig> p <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> secretion, and shifted the immune balance towards th <dig>  the data presented also shows that ps-g induces il- <dig> secretion. recent observations indicate that dcs play an important roles in activating regulatory t  cells, including induction of cd4+ t cells into foxp3+ treg cells in vitro  <cit> , il-10-producing cd4+ treg cells  <cit> , and regulating the balance of th1/th <dig> immunity  <cit> .

cytokines are involved in orchestrating the initiation and maintenance of allergic inflammatory responses. th <dig> cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  are involved in the development and maintenance of the allergic immune response. the th <dig> cytokine, ifn-γ, is known to down-regulate th <dig> responses by antagonizing il- <dig>  the selective production of ifn-γ is tightly regulated and is highly dependent on the reactivity of dcs to the environment, which in turn contributes to the t-cell polarization process. ps-g increases il- <dig> and il- <dig> production in dcs, although il- <dig> and il- <dig> appear to play a role in the induction of il- <dig> by human cd4+ t cells, il-1β, and tgf-β, in combination with other factors, which are essential in the induction of il- <dig> production  <cit> . thus, the production of il-17a by the stimulation of naïve t cells with dcs pulsed with ps-g, was not significantly changed in this study.

th <dig> cytokines have been shown to have an association with allergic disease. th <dig> cells are highly involved in the development and maintenance of psoriasis  <cit> , and a possible role for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and th <dig> cells in atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis is emerging. nickel-specific th <dig>  th <dig>  or th <dig> clones from allergic contact dermatitis patients have been shown to produce il- <dig>  <cit> . elevated il- <dig> concentrations have also been found in lung and blood of allergic asthma patients and has been linked to the severity of asthma  <cit> . whether or not a specific role exists for th <dig> cells in asthma, however, is controversial  <cit> .

this is the first study to demonstrate that ps-g induces the production of th <dig> cytokines produced by naïve human t cells through a direct effect on dcs in a model of children with allergic asthma. these results extend our previous findings that ps-g can induce gene expression changes in human dcs, and specifically promote th <dig> cytokine release in balb/c mice  <cit> . other studies have reported on the immunomodulatory and adjuvant activities of ps-g in mice  <cit> .

the cytokine environment encountered by a naïve cd4+t cell plays a prominent role in determining whether or not naïve cd4+ t cells develop into th <dig> or th <dig> cells. thus, the same naïve cd4+t cells can give rise to th <dig> or th <dig> cells under the influence of environmental  and genetic factors. ifn-γ production is related to an increase in il- <dig> p <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> production observed when md-dcs from children with allergic asthma are pulsed by der p  <dig> in the presence of ps-g. taken together, we suggest dcs may be the key cell type in children with allergic asthma.

il- <dig> also has an important function in promoting th <dig> immune responses and limiting the establishment and maintenance of th2-type responses, mainly by enhancing ifn-γ production and by providing an effective deviation signal during the early differentiation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . thus, il- <dig> p <dig> and il- <dig> p <dig> production by ps-g may contribute to switching the balance from an established th <dig> response to a more pronounced th <dig> response.

attempts to evaluate the effect of ps-g on specific t-cell proliferation in allergic asthmatic children has led to an apparent dichotomy for naïve t cells. whereas naïve t cells exhibit a weak proliferative response to der p 1-pulsed dcs, increased t cell proliferation is observed with ps-g-treated md-dcs. t-cell proliferation requires at least two signals, one through contact of antigen-mhc with t cell receptors and the other through an interaction between co-stimulatory molecules  <cit> . thus, the varying degrees of dc maturation may explain the differences observed in t-cell proliferation. similarly, lactic acid bacteria have been shown to have roles in modulating dc maturation from allergic patients  <cit> .

indeed, in response to der p  <dig>  dcs express quite low levels of co-stimulatory molecules compared to ps-g-pulsed dcs, which express intense up-regulation of the surface markers . there is an apparent relationship between the emergence of the ps-g-dependent t cell population and the increase in ifn-γ production.

CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that ps-g may switch the established th <dig> response in allergic patients towards a long-lasting th <dig> response, and may therefore represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of children with allergic asthma.
