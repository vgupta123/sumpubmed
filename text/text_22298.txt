BACKGROUND
l--tartaric acid , an important naturally existing hydroxyl carboxylic acid, is mainly used as antioxidant in food industry, as a chiral reagent in organic synthesis, as an acidic reducing agent in the textile industry and in galvanochemistry . it is also an alternative to citric acid as an acidulant in food additives for its superior organoleptic properties  <cit> . currently, the l-ta that is commercially available is produced exclusively through the stereospecific hydrolysis of cis-epoxysuccinate . in this process, the reaction is catalyzed by the cis-epoxysuccinate hydrolase from rhodococcus rhodochrous, nocardia tartaricans, corynebacterium sp. or pseudomonas sp.  <cit> . however, cis-epoxysuccinate is derived from petrochemical-based precursor maleic anhydride, and this limits the production of l-ta. therefore, development of the sustainable alternative solution for l-ta manufacture has recently attracted increasing attention.

a promising route has been employed for the production of l-ta by sequential whole-cell catalyzed oxidation and chemical catalysis, in which the glucose was first biologically converted to 5-keto-d-gluconate  by gluconobacter oxydans, then to l-ta in the presence of ammonium vanadate as a trace element  <cit> . thus, the strategy towards an efficient synthetic route to l-ta was to optimize the enzymatic production of 5-kga  <cit> .

through genomic analyses, the genome sequence of g. oxydans 621h has been published, which leads to new insights into its metabolic pathway  <cit> . the essential genetic elements related to 5-kga metabolism have been systematically identified . the membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase , a quinoprotein containing pyrroloquinoline quinone , oxidizes d-glucose to d-glucono-δ-lactone, which is subsequently converted to gluconic acid  spontaneously or by gluconolactonase . ga can be further oxidized to 5-kga or 2-keto-d-gluconate  by pqq-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase  or fad-dependent gluconate 2-dehydrogenase , which transfer electrons from glucose to the respiratory chain ubiquinone and then to terminal ubiquinol oxidases to generate the proton motive force  <cit> . pqq, heme c or fad serve as prosthetic groups  <cit> .fig.  <dig> scheme of glucose metabolism and the respiratory chain in gluconobacter oxydans dsm <dig>  abbreviations: mgdh, membrane-bound pqq-dependent glucose dehydrogenase; sldab, membrane-bound pqq-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase; ga2dh, membrane-bound fad-dependent gluconate 2-dehydrogenase; cydab, cytochrome bd oxidase; cyobacd, cytochrome bo

so far several attempts have been made to increase 5-kga production, such as overexpression of gluconate: nadp 5-oxidoreductase  <cit> , inactivation of ga2dh  <cit>  and overexpression of sldh  <cit>  and optimization of the media conditions  <cit> . the highest yield achieved of 5-kga was 240–295 mm  in a batch fermentation over periods as long as 72 h with a productivity of  <dig>  g/  <cit> . however, the methods used are individual engineering approaches and the efficiency of 5-kga production was unsatisfactory, especially there was a large amount of residual ga left at the end of the biotransformation process.

in early work, we constructed the recombinant strain g. oxydans zju <dig>  in which the gox <dig> and gox <dig> genes were markerless deleted  <cit> . the engineering of 2-kga and acetic acid metabolism pathway could enhanced the 5-kga production, but the titer and productivity of 5-kga was unsatisfied. hence, we set out to develop an efficient gluconobacter cell factory to facilitate 5-kga biosynthesis using combinatorial strategies. the sldab gene, encoding the sldh, was plasmid-based overexpressed with a strong promoter, p <dig>  <cit> . inspired by the mechanism from most of the gluconobacter, it is proposed that the cofactor pqq and respiratory chain engineering could be enhanced efficiency of the membrane-bound quinoaproteins. as a result, the genes involved with the pqq cluster  <cit>  and terminal ubiquinol cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase  <cit>  were fused expression. the related specific enzyme activity, h+/o ratio and 5-kga titer were investigated. base on the ph shift and dissolved oxygen tension  control, the robust g. oxydans cells were more facilitated 5-kga accumulation by the fed-batch fermentation. this study represents combinatorial engineering approaches collectively increased the titer of 5-kga in the g. oxydans, which can provide insights into devising engineering strategies to improve the object production.

RESULTS
promoter selection in g. oxydans strain
increasing interest in gluconobacter has led to investigations on strain improvement. the well characterized promoter is a prerequisite to the understanding of gene expression. so far, a few studies concerning the isolation and characterization of g. oxydans promoters, such as p <dig>  <cit> , ptufb  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , and p <dig>  <cit> , have been reported. however, which one is more suit for gene expression in g. oxydans is inconclusive. to select the appropriate promoter for gene expression in g. oxydans, we generated the different promoters in front of a gfp report gene in a pbbr1mcs <dig> vector. the promoter activity was indirectly determined by measuring the whole cell fluorescence intensity . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the rfu/od <dig> presented a linear increase with the cell growth until 24 h. green fluorescent protein  contains a fluorescent cyclic tri-peptide, and oxygen is required for the final oxidation of the mature, cyclized fluorophore of gfp  <cit> . for this reason, the rfu was impacted by the level of the do, which explained that the rfu/od <dig> remained stable after 24 h. however, among this four different promoters, the cells expressing gfp under regulation of p <dig> promoter exhibited outstanding effect in the g. oxydans. the observation elucidated that the p <dig> promoter was evidently recognized by g. oxydans and could reliably drive heterologous gene expression in g. oxydans.fig.  <dig> expression of green fluorescent protein in g. oxydans dsm <dig> under the control of different promoter. the whole cell relative fluorescence unit  are the averages of three different experiments divided by the cell density at 600 nm. ■ p <dig> promoter,  p <dig> promoter,  p <dig> promoter,  ptufb promoter



enzyme activity and relative transcriptional level of sldab overexpression strain
the glucose metabolism of the mutant g. oxydans zju <dig> strain showed the positive effect on the 5-kga production  <cit> , but it remained low productivity of 5-kga. to boost the 5-kga production, the sldab gene was plasmid-based overexpressed in g. oxydans zju <dig> under the control of the selected p <dig> promoter, generating g. oxydans zju <dig>  the enzyme activity of sldh of g. oxydans zju <dig> toward ga and the mrna abundance of sldab were investigated . the sldh activity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/mg protein, which was more 3-fold higher than that of the reference strain. the sldab expression data obtained were normalized to the transcriptional level of the 16s rna. g. oxydans zju <dig> achieved the relative transcriptional level of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which was 4-fold higher than those of the control. the results showed that the specific enzyme activities and transcription of the sldab gene in g. oxydans could be markedly enhanced by sldab overexpressed under the control of the selected p <dig> promoter. in the literature  <cit> , the stability and transcriptional level of the mrna by adding poly  tails at the 3’-utr of the sldab were discussed. it was revealed that an artificial poly  tail was proposed to slow down the mrna degradation process in bacteria and the high sldab expression levels were achieved. this well demonstrated the importance of the mrna stability on the gene expression, which should be considered in our late study.table  <dig> enzyme activities and relative transcriptional levels of the membrane-bound sldh in g. oxydans strains

batch fermentation by sldab overexpression strain
the batch fermentation by the recombinant g. oxydans zju <dig> strain was performed on a 15 l agitation tank under dot rich condition. the results demonstrated that all tested strains had the similar trend of glucose consumption rate and cell growth . the glucose was rapidly oxidized and exhausted at 30 h, while about 130 ±  <dig>  g/l of ga was accumulated over the same time frame. the reference strain, g. oxydans zju <dig>  accumulated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l 5-kga in the broth, but the residual ga was quite high at about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l . in the fermentation process using recombinant g. oxydans zju <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of 5-kga with the productivity of  <dig>  g/ were obtained at 64 h . compared with the reference strain, the titer of 5-kga was increased  <dig>  % and the residual ga was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, decreased  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> time-course of the oxidative fermentation in a 15-l fermentation tank and coenzyme pqq complement study. a, c

however, the dcw of the tested strains was about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, which was lower than other bacteria. in recent study, dna microarray analysis and 13c metabolic flux analysis  are used to characterize the two growth phases of g. oxydans in the presence of glucose  <cit> . in the first growth phase, 90 % of the glucose is oxidized by the mgdh to ga, accompanied by reasonable growth, high demand for oxygen and a low formation of co <dig>  the onset of phase ii results in reduced biomass and demand for oxygen while the ga was oxidized in the periplasm to 5-kga . thus, only a small percentage of the carbon source is taken up by cell, resulting in modest cell growth and poor cell yield. g. oxydans ifo <dig> and g. oxydans 621h cells cultivated on glucose medium provids a cell yield of  <dig>  g cdw/g glucose  <cit> . in comparison to these values, e. coli reaches a value of  <dig>  g cdw/g glucose  <cit> , and bacillus subtilis reaches a yield of  <dig>  g cdw/g glucose  <cit> . in phase i and ii, the cytoplasmic sugar catabolism proceeded predominantly via the ppp, particularly in phase ii  <cit> .

during the glucose metabolism by g. oxydans, the mgdh and sldh serve as the main enzymes, and pqq is the cofactor. the pqq supplementation experiments showed that the control strain g. oxydans zju <dig> was not significantly influenced by the exogenous pqq , but the g. oxydans zju <dig> strain showed the respond to pqq supplementation in a similar manner, achieving the highest 5-kga production when the added pqq was up to 500 μg/l . a total of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of 5-kga was produced by g. oxydans zju <dig>  these results indicated that the addition of pqq could enhance the production of 5-kga in the sldh overexpression strain, which was in agreement with a recent report that the overexpression of pqq-dependent dehydrogenases could lead to imbalance between coenzyme pqq level and the corresponding quinoproteins  <cit> .

enhanced pqq biosynthesis to improve 5-kga production
to further augment the 5-kga production, the pqq biosynthesis gene, pqqabcde, was engineered and the biomass growth, pqq concentration and 5-kga production were shown in table  <dig>  in g. oxydans zju <dig>  overexpression of pqqabcde gene cluster under the control of p <dig> promoter led to the excretion of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/l of pqq into the supernatant, which was enhanced by  <dig>  % compared with that by the parent strain while the 5-kga concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, an increase of  <dig>  %. this also confirmed the results from the pqq supplement experiment  that the coenzyme pqq was the key factor driving the 5-kga production. in g. oxydans zju <dig>  simultaneous expression of the pqq gene cluster and an associated tldd gene produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/l of pqq, which was increased by  <dig>  % compared with that from g. oxydans zju <dig>  these results were consistent with the literature finding that the tldd gene was related to the pqq biosynthesis  <cit> . the 5-kga production by g. oxydans zju <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l. in addition, the cell growth of g. oxydans zju <dig> was comparable to that of g. oxydans zju <dig>  this finding implied that tldd gene expression did not affect the cell growth.table  <dig> effects of overexpression pqqabcde cluster and tldd genes in g. oxydans strains







overexpression of metabolic pathways involving redox reactions may lead to cofactor imbalances, thus impairing the yield of products. cofactor engineering approaches are often adopted to compensate for imbalance of cofactors to improve product biosynthesis  <cit> , for example, manipulating the availability of intracellular nadh  <cit>  and nadph  <cit> . in g. oxydans, quinoproteins and their cofactor pqq can catalyze the oxidation of substrates by pqq regulated electron transfer in the respiratory chain. however, the biosynthesis of quinoproteins and their cofactor pqq are usually independent  <cit> . therefore, the pqq gene cluster was overexpressed in gluconobacter oxydans wsh- <dig>  <cit>  and ketogulonigenium vulgare  <cit> , which demonstrated to improve 2-keto-l-gulonic acid  production by cofactor engineering. these advance significantly facilitated the development of the efficient strains to produce 5-kga.

notably, it was reported that disruption of tldd gene in g. oxydans led to a drop of pqq excretion below the detection limit and a decrease in cell growth, indicating that the related tldd gene was essential for pqq biosynthesis  <cit> . the tldd protein of g. oxydans 621h, related to the e. coli tldd, is a peptidase involved in processing of small peptides. in other pqq-producing bacteria, the peptidase-like protein pqqf is required for pqq synthesis and has a similar function as the tldd in g. oxydans  <cit> . therefore, our study demonstrated that overexpression of the tldd gene could increase pqq level by  <dig>  % in g. oxydans zju <dig> compared with that of g. oxydans zju <dig> . this cofactor engineering was adopted to compensate the shortage of cofactors in the pqq-dependent sldh overexpression strain and to improve the 5-kga production.

the engineering of the respiratory chain
in an earlier study, the cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase  was found to be the main component for proton extrusion via the respiratory chain in g. oxydans 621h  <cit> . to enhance the respiratory chain activity and the 5-kga production, the cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase was engineered. the cyobacd genes were fused into the pqq overexpression plasmid  under the p <dig> promoter control, generating pucpr-t <dig> and pucpr-t <dig>  the corresponding plasmids were electrotransferred into g. oxydans zju <dig>  resulting in g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig>  respectively.

the batch fermentations of g. oxydans zju <dig>  g. oxydans zju <dig>  g. oxydans zju <dig>  and g. oxydans zju <dig>  under an excess of oxygen, showed that all recombinant g. oxydans strains reached their maximal otr. the time points of maximal otr correlated with the time points at which about 60 % glucose had been predominantly oxidized to ga in the periplasm . g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig> reached their maximal otr of  <dig>  mmol/l · h and  <dig>  mmol/l · h, respectively at 19 h. after complete consumption of glucose, the otr decreased to  <dig>  to  <dig>  mmol/l · h. the specific maximal co <dig> production rate  of both strains was  <dig>  mmol/l · h at 32 h, then it began to decrease . the ctr decreased below  <dig>  mmol/l · h at 57 h for the g. oxydans zju <dig> strain, but it decreased below this level at 60 h for g. oxydans zju <dig>  this meant that the tldd gene overexpression could increase the pqq biosynthesis and the oxidation rate of sldh. the situations of g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig> were remarkable different with those of g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig>  where  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l 5-kga was accumulated, respectively. the glucose oxidation rate was accelerated, and glucose was exhausted at 20 h. the maximal otr of  <dig>  mmol/l · h and  <dig>  mmol/l · h were achieved at 11 h, respectively. after 22 h, the ctrs of zju <dig> and zju <dig> reached the maximal values of  <dig>  mmol/l · h and  <dig>  mmol/l · h, respectively. the ctr of g. oxydans zju <dig> decreased to  <dig>  mmol/l · h at 47 h, which was 13 h and 3 h short than those of g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig>  respectively . this indicated that the oxidation of ga to 5-kga by g. oxydans zju <dig> had completely finished at 47 h.fig.  <dig> the otr and ctr value and the glucose metabolism. a, e

using the constructed g. oxydans strains, the h+/o ratio and terminal ubiquinol bo <dig> oxidase activity were also measured when the cells were in the logarithmic growth phase . the results were shown in table  <dig>  the average h+/o ratio and terminal ubiquinol oxidase activity of the control strain g. oxydans zju <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min · mg, respectively. the g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig> had an h+/o ratio and terminal ubiquinol oxidase activity comparable to those of the control strain, implying the mutant growth was not impaired under conditions of pqq cluster overexpression. however, the recombinant g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig> showed a 64 % increase of the h+/o ratio  and  <dig> -fold of the ubiquinol oxidase activity  compared with the control strain, respectively. a total of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l 5-kga was accumulated by g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig>  respectively. this indicated the expression of ubiquinol bo <dig> oxidase could enhance respiratory proton translocation and increase the 5-kga production in g. oxydans.table  <dig> h+/o ratio and ubiquinol oxidase activity of recombinant g. oxydans strains








athe h+/o measured by the oxygen pulse method



g. oxydans possesses a branched respiratory chain consisting of two terminal ubiquinol oxidases, cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase and cytochrome bd oxidase  . the genome sequence also revealed genes for a cytochrome bc <dig> complex  and a soluble cytochrome c   <cit> . the absence of cytochrome bd oxidase did not affect the cell growth or proton extrusion via the respiratory chain, whereas absence of the genes encoding cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase caused a severe growth defect  <cit> . plasmid-based overproduction of cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase under the p <dig> promoter control increased the respiration-driven proton extrusion by  <dig>  % in g. oxydans zju <dig> and g. oxydans zju <dig>  compared with the control strains . the increase in the h+/o ratio might be owing to the presence of more bo <dig> quinol oxidase and its proposed high oxygen affinity, which should favor oxygen reduction under the experimental conditions of an oxygen pulse  <cit> . the h+/o ratio for the reference strain, g. oxydans zju <dig>  was measured as  <dig>  ±  <dig> . in the literature, h+/o ratios reported for e. coli vary between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , which was more than 2-fold higher than that of the g. oxydans zju <dig> strain. a major difference of the respiratory chain between the two species is the lack of the multisubunit proton-pumping nadh dehydrogenase i  in the g. oxydans  <cit> . however, ndh-i is preferentially synthesized during anaerobic growth in the presence of alternate electron acceptors  <cit> . therefore, what extent ndh-i contributes to the h+/o ratio is unclear. as the bd oxidase was not relevant for proton translocation, an h+/o ration of  <dig> might be assumed for g. oxydans  <cit> . however, our results were much lower than a value of  <dig>  richhardt explained that cytochrome bo <dig> oxidase might not function as a primary proton pump but as a na+ pump and the respiratory chain could involve a reverse electron transfer coupled to an influx of protons  <cit> .

interestingly, an increased  <dig>  % cell yield was observed when the bo <dig> oxidase gene was overexpressed . the possibility of an increased bo <dig> oxidase level in g. oxydans could cause a shift of the electron flux from the non-proton pumping bd oxidase to the proton pumping bo <dig> oxidase  <cit> . another explanation for the increased cell growth is the assumption that the activity of the bo <dig> oxidase is limited and can be increased by its overproduction. this was confirmed in the experiments that the ubiquinol oxidase activity increased  <dig> -fold  and the otr enhanced  <dig>  mmol/l · h  by overexpressed the cyobacd genes, indicating that cytochrome bo <dig> quinol oxidase played the positive role in the cell growth and substrate oxidation. recently, a limitation of oxygen consumption by the activity of the terminal oxidase was reported after overexpressing the membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase   <cit> . this implied that the activity of bo <dig> quinol oxidase might be high enough to satisfy the increased capacity for oxygen reduction.

process optimization and fed-batch fermentation
the constructed g. oxydans zju <dig> showed good potential for 5-kga production. to fulfill the requirement of industrial production of 5-kga, the fermentation process was optimized, including the two-stage ph control, do control and glucose feed. as shown in fig. 5a, the glucose was oxidized faster and exhausted at 14 h when the ph was controlled at  <dig> . this result was consistent with the previous results where a ph of  <dig>  was suitable for the activity of membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase  <cit> . however, a ph of  <dig>  was more suitable for synthesis of 5-kga by sldh. in the early study, the ph of the culture medium was an important factor for selective production of 5-kga by g. suboxydans ifo  <dig>  in which an 87 % glucose conversion rate could be achieved by controlling the medium ph in a range of  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . according to the experimental results, we have established a two-stage ph control strategy, whereas the ph is controlled as  <dig>  in the first stage to let the glucose oxidation and cell growth, then it is shifted to  <dig> , facilitating 5-kga formation.fig.  <dig>

in its natural habitat, g. oxydans is likely subjected to low-oxygen stress conditions because of the rapid oxygen consumption as a result of its own metabolism. the otr and ctr were previously investigated during the 5-kga production, in which the high otr was observed when the glucose was oxidized to ga in the periplasm . it was reported that oxygen limitation could cause expression changes of  <dig> genes, representing 20 % of the chromosomal genes  <cit> . therefore, during this stage, it must ensure the adequate dot above 20 % by increasing the agitation speed. the onset of 5-kga formation decreased the demand for dot but increased the ctr . hence, to improve the cost performance of the industrial production of 5-kga, dot was continuously controlled by adjusting the agitation speed according to otr and ctr.

additionally, to achieve the hyper-production of 5-kga by the recombinant g. oxydans zju <dig> strain, the glucose fed-batch fermentation was carried out under the dot and ph control. a glucose feed of about 1400 g was started at 12 h when the glucose concentration was below 40 g/l and was used to maintain the glucose at 40 ~ 50 g/l . the ga quickly accumulated during this stage. when the glucose concentration dropped to 14 g/l at 28 h, the 5-kga began to quickly be formed and the ph shifted from  <dig>  to  <dig> . concurrently, the dot was controlled above 20 %. using glucose fed-batch fermentation, dot control, and a ph shift strategy, the 5-kga titer was increased to 162 ±  <dig>  g/l with the  <dig>  g/ productivity by the recombinant g. oxydans zju <dig> strain, which was increased by 10-fold compared to the wild-type strain . this indicated that the pqq overexpression and respiratory chain modification could efficiently enhance 5-kga accumulation. furthermore, the problem of residual ga was well solved, and the final concentration of ga was reduced to  <dig>  g/l, which should decrease the separation difficulty. these results illustrated that the supplement of co-enzyme to the membrane-bound dehydrogenases was increased by overexpression of the pqq cluster genes. the efficiency of electron transfer to o <dig> was enhanced by overexpression of the genes for the bo <dig> oxidase, which increased the activity of respiratory chain.

CONCLUSIONS
bacteria of the genus gluconobacter exhibit so-called oxidative fermentation, or incomplete oxidation, a highly unusual metabolic feature that has been exploited industrially for decades in the production of vitamin c, ga and dihydroxyacetone  <cit> . in this study, the role of the combinatorial metabolic engineering of the industrial g. oxydans for the boosting of 5-kga accumulation was investigated. in summary, the sldab was overexpressed under the selected p <dig> promoter. in addition, the pqq gene cluster and terminal ubiquinol bo <dig> oxidase were fused overexpression to strengthen the glucose oxidation. under the optimized culture conditions of the fed-batch process, the combinatorial approaches collectively increased the 5-kga titer 10-fold, reached 162 ±  <dig>  g/l. the results showed great potential for optimizing the current producer strain of g. oxydans used in industrial biotechnology, which presents the first report of 5-kga production by combinatorial metabolic engineering approaches in g. oxydans. we envision that these approaches could provide framework for devising engineering strategies to improve the production of biochemicals in g. oxydans. nevertheless, some issues are still worth further study, for example, how many copies of pqq cluster and bo <dig> oxidase genes overexpression can be matched the quinoproteins requirements, especially in the quinoproteins overexpression strains. the genome sequence has revealed that the tca cycle is incomplete as genes for succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl coa synthetase were absent  <cit> . to develop more robust strains, the strategy involving direct repair of this defective metabolic pathway by genomic integration of heterologous genes should be investigated, while considering the g. oxydans as a broadly applicable host for oxidative industrial bioconversions.
