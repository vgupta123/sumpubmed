BACKGROUND
the life history of anadromous salmonids entails movements between freshwater and seawater environments. to cope with the physiological demands associated with such behaviour, salmonids and other teleosts have evolved the capacity to change their ionoregulatory condition by altering states of ion uptake  and excretion . in teleosts, mitochondria-rich cells are located in the epithelial layer of fish gill tissue and play a major role in hypo-osmoregulation. the molecular mechanisms within and around mitochondria-rich cells function together to facilitate the removal of na+ and cl- from blood plasma and are an integral part of the mitochondria-rich cell model
 <cit> . active exchange of cytoplasmic na+ with intercellular k+ by na+/k+-atpase pumps maintains an electrochemical gradient sufficient to move intercellular cl- across the basolateral membrane and into the cell via na+/k+/2cl-  cotransporters. cl- exits the cell across the apical membrane through embedded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-like anion channels . intercellular na+ is secreted through leaky cation-selective paracellular pores between accessory cells and mitochondria-rich cells
 <cit> , where variation in permeability rates are thought to be a function of claudin isoform type
 <cit> .

several genes that are not part of the current mitochondria-rich cell model are also involved in the hypo-osmoregulatory process. insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  transcription is positively correlated with elevated salinity tolerance
 <cit> . growth hormone  levels
 <cit>  also regulate this balance, as illustrated by gh injections that correlate with a rapid increase in salinity tolerance capacity
 <cit> . such short-term effects could be related to changes in gill tissue cell structure, as gh has been connected with seawater-induced mitochondria-rich cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy
 <cit> . moreover, atlantic salmon smolts  have larger relative gill weights compared to non-smolts  of equal size
 <cit> , which suggests that smoltification-induced changes in cell structure may be reflected by changes in gill weight. the localization of salinity tolerance qtl in multiple species to linkage groups where gh  and igf <dig> are mapped 
 <cit>  is consistent with the hypothesis that allelic variation at the loci encoding these hormones exerts significant affects on hypo-osmoregulatory capacity. unsurprisingly, growth hormone receptor , which modulates tissue-specific activity of gh
 <cit> , is upregulated concurrently with elevated salinity and the onset of smoltification in rainbow trout and atlantic salmon, respectively
 <cit> . collagen type i alpha i , secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine 
 <cit> , and calcium-sensing receptors 
 <cit>  are also upregulated in atlantic salmon smolts. col1a <dig> appears to be involved in the composition of the extracellular matrix and arch formation of fish gills
 <cit> , while sparc has been associated with tissue remodelling. by binding to structural proteins such as collagen type i, sparc regulates cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix
 <cit> . lastly, calcium-sensing receptors  are thought to act as osmosensors by sending regulatory signals in response to elevated plasma ion concentrations
 <cit> .

within the salmonidae family there is wide variation in both anadromy and salinity tolerance capacity among species
 <cit> . sea-run atlantic salmon  are iteroparous and have high saltwater tolerance, spending multiple years at sea between river spawning migrations. at the other extreme, anadromy in arctic charr  involves shorter periods of seawater residency , which is accompanied by a relatively low capacity for hypo-osmoregulation
 <cit> . both of these species also show wide intraspecific variation in salinity tolerance capacity.

while in seawater, different atlantic salmon families show large differences in blood plasma osmolality concentrations
 <cit> , while wide disparity in seawater-induced mortality
 <cit>  has been observed in different strains of arctic charr, as have family-based differences in na+/k+-atpase activity levels and blood plasma osmolality concentrations
 <cit> . such studies suggest that inter- and intraspecific variation in salinity tolerance capacity is affected by genetic variation. in fact, recent research shows that quantitative trait loci  for various salinity tolerance performance indicator traits localize to homologous linkage groups in rainbow trout
 <cit>  and arctic charr
 <cit> . these qtl localize to linkage groups that are predicted to contain genes for the primary mechanisms from the mitochondria-rich cell model 
 <cit> .

the extent that the genetic basis of salinity tolerance is conserved across salmonidae species is unclear. well established chromosome homologies among arctic charr and rainbow trout
 <cit>  have facilitated assessments of the conservation of salinity tolerance qtl. several tentative qtl homologies have been identified, but differences in experimental design and genetic map resolution have made comparisons difficult. assessment of the salinity tolerance qtl positions in atlantic salmon would contribute knowledge on the conserved homologous qtl genomic locations influencing this trait in salmonids.

the evolutionary lineage of modern salmonids is unique in that it is punctuated by four whole-genome duplication events. two whole-genome duplication events have occurred in all vertebrate lineages 
 <cit> . doubly conserved synteny blocks among tetraodon nigroviridis and homo sapiens <cit>  show that a third whole-genome duplication occurred in fishes . in modern salmonids, residual tetrasomic inheritance, multivalent formations, and hox gene duplication patterns suggest that a fourth whole-genome duplication occurred in the salmonid ancestor some 25- <dig> million years ago 
 <cit> . evidence suggests that the 4r duplication may have had ramifications for the evolution of salinity tolerance, for in arctic charr there are multiple instances where trait-specific qtl localize to homeologous linkage groups 
 <cit> . such patterns would be expected if duplicated loci were subfunctionalized or if a redundant locus was neofunctionalized, contrary to the usual fate of duplicated loci 
 <cit> . in addition, duplicate gene function may simply be retained because of positive selective advantage. on the other hand, patterns suggestive of qtl homeology would be indistinguishable from patterns resulting from qtl linked to non-paralogous loci, if such loci were tightly linked in the salmonid ancestor prior to the 4r duplication event and have since been conserved on only reciprocal homeologues in extant salmonids . interestingly, the latter scenario is consistent with observations that suggest some salinity tolerance candidate genes occur in clusters within the same linkage group region
 <cit> , and could singly or in combination contribute to the apparent conserved qtl homeologies that were identified.

disparity in genomic structure among atlantic salmon , arctic charr  and rainbow trout 
 <cit>  could have lead to differences in the arrangement of genes related to salinity tolerance. the non-randomness of gene order
 <cit>  in conjunction with the co-expression of gene clusters in eukaryotes
 <cit>  implies that gene arrangement is important in the evolution of phenotypes. more specifically, it suggests that genes in close proximity are more likely to be involved in the same biochemical pathway
 <cit> , and that disruptions in these regions could conceivably affect development of the respective phenotype. the availability of the reconstructed 2r proto-actinopterygian ancestral karyotype and the sequenced genomes of multiple 3r teleost species provide an opportunity to examine the extent that genomic rearrangements may have affected the relative positions of salinity tolerance candidate genes in 3r and 4r genomes. the approximate positions of candidate genes in 4r genomes can be predicted using knowledge of their precise positions in 3r genomes in conjunction with synteny patterns evident among 3r and 4r species. comparisons with the positions of salinity tolerance qtl would then provide an opportunity to assess whether disparity in salinity tolerance capacity could be correlated with differences in genomic structure.

the characterization of salinity tolerance qtl in atlantic salmon and subsequent comparisons with arctic charr and rainbow trout will allow us to determine which qtl are conserved across species using information from three different genera . comparative genomics approaches will also allow us to infer if genomic rearrangements have affected the relative positions of salinity tolerance candidate genes in the genomes of salmonids. using two out-bred atlantic salmon families, we examined the genetic architecture of salinity tolerance performance traits after exposure to seawater in a controlled environment designed to simulate natural conditions. we addressed the following questions:  does genetic variation have a significant effect on salinity tolerance performance traits in atlantic salmon?  do salinity tolerance qtl share homeologous affinities?  do qtl share homologous affinities with qtl in other salmonids?  do qtl localize to linkage groups that contain or are predicted to contain candidate genes?  is the relative arrangement of candidate genes different among 2r, 3r, and 4r species?  is disparity in salinity tolerance capacity among salmonid species correlated with variation in genomic structure?

RESULTS
genetic maps
from the parents of two full-sib families  four sex-specific maps were created . eight to seventeen linkage groups per family were comprised of a minimum of two markers. twenty-three of a possible maximum of 29
 <cit>  chromosomes were represented by linkage groups from all parents combined. linkage group  <dig> was represented by a single unlinked marker. five linkage groups were not included in this study due to an absence of marker polymorphism . chromosome identity was ascribed to unlinked markers and marker linkage groups by comparison with the respective marker affinities on existing atlantic salmon mapping panels
 <cit> .

qtl analysis
single-parent analysis yielded no genome-wide significant qtl and a total of ten linkage groups were associated with chromosome-wide significant qtl across both traits . na+/k+-atpase activity qtl were found on as-4p, -4q, - <dig>  -14q, -19q, - <dig>  -and - <dig>  while blood plasma osmolality qtl were found on as- <dig>  -4q, - <dig>  -12p, -12q, -14q, -19q, and -17q. co-localization of qtl among na+/k+-atpase activity and blood plasma osmolality was evident on as-4q, -14q, and -19q. combined family analysis yielded qtl on as-4q significant at the genome-wide level for na+/k+-atpase activity and the chromosome-wide level for blood plasma osmolality. the percentage of experimental variation explained by qtl for na+/k+-atpase activity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with the greatest percentages associated with as-14q and - <dig>  at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. variation explained by blood plasma osmolality qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with the most explained by loci on as-12q, -14q, and -4q, at  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.

comparative genomics with 3r species
among the linkage groups associated with salinity tolerance qtl in atlantic salmon we found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genetic markers exhibiting significant homology with the zebrafish , three-spined stickleback , medaka , and green-spotted pufferfish  genomes, respectively. similar patterns were evident in comparisons with arctic charr, where  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genetic markers showed homology with the respective aforementioned 3r genomes. because preliminary comparisons revealed that stickleback shared the greatest synteny with salmonid genomes, full synteny maps for atlantic salmon, arctic charr, and rainbow trout were constructed based on comparisons with the stickleback genome.

all linkage group arms from the most recent atlantic salmon mapping panel
 <cit>  were syntenic with at least a single stickleback chromosome . thirteen linkage group arms had syntenic affinities with two stickleback chromosomes, , while five arms had mosaic affinities with three stickleback chromosomes . atlantic salmon linkage groups designated as a, b, or c reflect linkage group arms that show patterns consistent with ancestral inter-arm fusion events, where each letter represents a segment that has homologous affinities with a different rainbow trout chromosome arm
 <cit> .
 <cit>  are colour-coded as per the legend on the bottom right-hand corner. synteny maps are based on the most recent published linkage maps containing information for est accessions within each salmonid
 <cit>  and the broad s <dig> stickleback genome sequence from ensembl v <dig> - v61
 <cit> . salmonid linkage groups  and stickleback chromosomes  are standardized to  <dig> units. chromosomes and linkage groups are arranged in a p-arm to q-arm clockwise orientation unless otherwise noted. the positions of centromeres  on metacentric linkage groups as-4/11/12/17/19/24/28/31/ <dig> are undefined, as is the orientation of as-19/28p/28q/31/ <dig>  rt-1/14p/14q/18q/26/ <dig>  and all arctic charr linkage groups. rt-18p is not included on the reference mapping panel. satellite marker groupings that remain unlinked to a primary linkage group segment have + <dig>  + <dig> or + <dig> appended to their predicted linkage group affiliation. ideograms created using circos
 <cit> .

due to the relatively low marker resolution of the arctic charr mapping panel
 <cit> , synteny with the stickleback genome was undefined for several linkage groups  . however, known homologies between arctic charr and rainbow trout
 <cit>  suggest that certain syntenies can be expected: ac-10/rt-10q&18q/ga-ii&xix, ac-14/rt-24q/ga-xvii, ac-16/rt-8q/ga-viii, ac-27/rt-7q/ga-xxi, ac-27+2/rt-12p&16p/ga-i&ii&xv&xvi, ac-27+3/rt-19p/ga-xxi, ac-43/rt-9p/ga-vii&xiv. no linkage group arms were syntenic with more than a single stickleback chromosome, and marker coverage to infer homologies is still largely incomplete in the salmonids as synteny blocks on seven linkage groups spanned less than 10% of the total linkage group length . consequently, five stickleback chromosomes showed no syntenic affinity with any arctic charr linkage group . nevertheless, knowledge of synteny patterns of rainbow trout with stickleback  and with arctic charr
 <cit>   allowed us to deduce probable homologies with arctic charr for most of the unassigned chromosomes: ga-vi/rt-17p/ac-8+ <dig>  ga-viii/rt-8q&-24p/ac-13& <dig>  ga-xv/rt-16p/ac-4&12&27+ <dig>  ga-xxi/rt-7q&19p/ac-11&12&14&27&27+ <dig> 

six linkage group arms in the rainbow trout mapping panel
 <cit>  could not be assigned a syntenic affinity with any stickleback chromosome , while eight linkage group arms had multiple syntenic affinities . rt-12p and -16p in particular had mosaic syntenies with three  and four  stickleback chromosomes, respectively. ga-xviii was the only stickleback chromosome without syntenic affinities on any rainbow trout linkage group due to lack of marker homologies between the maps. however, ga-xviii is largely derived from the a ancestral lineage of teleost chromosomes , and hence homologies to either rt-14q, -24q or -25q could be expected
 <cit> .
 <cit> . syntenic affinities are colour-coded as per the legend on the bottom left-hand corner. the size of each chromosome is denoted in millions of base-pairs at the bottom of each chromosome and was obtained from ensembl v60
 <cit> .

stickleback 3r duplicated homeologies
several homeologous chromosome pairs have remained largely conserved in the stickleback lineage  as pairs of chromosomes characterized by lineage-specific duplicated regions . several ancestral groupings are recognized as having one of the pair of chromosomes retained largely intact, with the duplicated regions within the lineage mosaically distributed along with other ancestral chromosome regions. for example, a single chromosome from the c ancestral lineage  is conserved, however the homeolgous regions from this ancestral group have been divided and arrayed on segments of ga-i, ga-ii and ga-vi. similarly, chromosomes ga-v and ga-xix appear to be mosaic arrangements between lineage d/e and j/k elements, respectively. larger regions of homology within single chromosomes appear to occur with d lineage within ga-vi and within the e lineage on ga-xi. similarly, ga-ii is largely derived from the j lineage, while half of ga-iv appears to be derived from k lineage genes. ancestral lineage gh is likely derived from a triplication event in teleosts 
 <cit>  and is arrayed within segments of ga-i, -iv, and -vii, with all these chromosomes possessing larger fused segments of c, f/k, and f segments, respectively. larger syntenic blocks from the f ancestral lineage do appear retained within ga-ix, but even this chromosome appears to be derived from mosaic arrangements with d/e lineage genes, which may have arisen from multiple translocation and/or fusion events.

discussion
the detection of salinity tolerance qtl in the atlantic salmon genome indicates that allelic variation at certain loci exerts significant effects on salinity tolerance performance traits. we found multiple chromosome-wide significant qtl for na+/k+-atpase activity and/or blood plasma osmolality over nine linkage groups. among these we found a single genome-wide significant qtl on ac-4q. co-localization of qtl for both traits occurred on as-4q, -14q and -19q.

homeologous qtl patterns
the distribution of salinity tolerance qtl in arctic charr and rainbow trout reveal several possibilities where qtl may be at homeolgous loci
 <cit> , however, such patterns are not predominant in atlantic salmon. among several linkage groups with homeologous affinities, only two qtl localized to a homeologous region that is supported by a syntenic block of duplicated loci , which also contain duplicated copies of atp1α1b
 <cit> . single marker affinities suggest that additional homeologous qtl may occur on as-2/ <dig> and as-17/19
 <cit> . homologies among 3r and 4r genomic segments are evident when comparisons are made with stickleback chromosomes that are syntenic with multiple atlantic salmon linkage groups. for example, as-2/ <dig> share a syntenic block with ga-xix, as do as-17qb/9qab with ga-xiv, as-5qb/9qb with ga-vii, and as-12p/22qa with ga-iv.

the relative paucity of putative homeologous qtl could result from the low density of duplicated markers currently detected in the atlantic salmon map
 <cit> , but may also be a function of genomic structure. current mapping panels contain  <dig> % duplicated loci for atlantic salmon and 26% for rainbow trout, despite containing a similar contingent of type i and ii markers
 <cit> . this suggests that a smaller proportion of duplicate loci have been conserved in atlantic salmon and may account for the paucity of homeologous qtl. further, asymmetry in the conservation of duplicate loci may be related to the unique structure of the atlantic salmon karyotype, which is characterized by a reduction in chromosome arms  that is not evident in other salmonids, including arctic charr  and rainbow trout 
 <cit> .

homologous qtl patterns
salinity tolerance in atlantic salmon appears to be affected by some of the same genetic regions linked to qtl in other salmonids. homologies of atlantic salmon with arctic charr and rainbow trout suggest that the effects of these loci may be conserved. of the eleven linkage group arms affiliated with salinity tolerance qtl in atlantic salmon, eight are syntenic with linkage groups containing salinity tolerance qtl in arctic charr
 <cit>  , and two are syntenic with linkage groups containing similar qtl in rainbow trout
 <cit> . qtl synteny blocks that are conserved across all three species  provide the strongest support for the conservation of qtl effects in salmonids.

salinity tolerance qtl associated with na+/k+-atpase activity , blood plasma osmolality , blood plasma cl- concentration , gill tissue weight , and weight-specific growth rates at time s <dig> and s <dig>  homology assignments are based on >  <dig> markers ,  <dig> markers , or a single marker. linkage group  arms for arctic charr are undefined. all qtl are chromosome-wide significant. genome-wide significant qtl are underlined. data for rainbow trout  and arctic charr  qtl were obtained from le bras et al. 
 <cit>  and norman et al. 
 <cit> , respectively.

distribution of candidate genes in salmonid genomes
gene location predictions derived from comparative synteny maps of stickleback with atlantic salmon, arctic charr, and rainbow trout reveal three instances where atlantic salmon linkage groups associated with salinity tolerance qtl may possess candidate genes in unique combinations not evident in the other species  . in the first instance, as- <dig> is predicted to contain copies of cldn10e, igf <dig>  and cftr in addition to atp1α1b, which has been mapped to as-22/23
 <cit> . in both arctic charr and rainbow trout, this putative cluster is broken up into two distinct gene-pair groups: atp1α1b/cldn10e and igf2/cftr. synteny maps suggest that atp1α1b/cldn10e and igf2/cftr reside on separate arms of the metacentric ac- <dig> in arctic charr, while only the arm that is syntenic with atp1α1b/cldn10e is associated with a qtl. previous studies predict that ac-12/ <dig> contain duplicate copies of atp1α1b and cldn10e, however extensive synteny of ac- <dig> with ga-i, where orthologues of atp1α1b and cldn10e are located, suggests that these genes may instead reside on ac- <dig>  regardless, salinity tolerance qtl are associated with ac- <dig>  - <dig> and -27
 <cit> . duplicate copies of atp1α1b map to rt-12q/16p in rainbow trout
 <cit> . these locations are consistent with the predicted positions of atp1α1b/cldn10e based on synteny with stickleback, however rt-12q/16p were not associated with salinity tolerance qtl
 <cit> . it is unclear if this discordance can be attributed to biological differences or experimental design, given that le bras et al.  measured different performance indicators than in the current study and those used for arctic charr
 <cit> . nevertheless, the importance of these genes to salinity tolerance is well documented
 <cit> .
 <cit>  and the broad s <dig> stickleback genome sequence from ensembl v <dig> - v61
 <cit> . atlantic salmon linkage groups  and stickleback chromosomes  are standardized to  <dig> units. red synteny bands indicate linkage groups that contain salinity tolerance qtl. chromosomes and linkage groups are arranged in a p-arm to q-arm clockwise orientation unless otherwise noted. the positions of centromeres  on metacentric linkage groups as-4/11/12/17/24/28q are undefined, as is the orientation of as-28q/ <dig>  candidate genes include: na+/k+-atpase α-isoform  and -α1b isoform , calcium-sensing receptor , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-like anion channel , claudin isoform 10e , collagen type  <dig> alpha  <dig>  and alpha  <dig> , growth hormone , growth hormone receptor , insulin-like growth factors  <dig>  and  <dig> , na+/k+/2cl- isoform  <dig> , and secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine . the precise positions of candidate genes on stickleback chromosomes are denoted by connection lines , as are genes mapped in atlantic salmon
 <cit> . predicted gene positions on atlantic salmon linkage groups are represented by labels without connection lines. igf <dig> and nkcc <dig> map to as-24
 <cit>  and as-17q
 <cit> , respectively, however their precise positions are unknown. ideogram created using circos
 <cit> .

the second novel candidate gene cluster was located on as- <dig>  where igf <dig> and cldn10e duplicates were predicted to occur in conjucntion with a mapped duplicate of atp1α1b. igf <dig> is located on ac-3/ <dig> in arctic charr
 <cit> , though neither linkage group has been reported to be associated with a salinity tolerance qtl
 <cit> . igf <dig> duplicates in rainbow trout are located on rt-7p/15p, and only rt-15p is linked with a qtl. a copy of igf <dig> is located on as-24
 <cit> , which is homeologous to as-22
 <cit> . though experiments clearly show that igf <dig> is involved in hypo-osmoregulation
 <cit> , evidence that allelic variation at igf <dig> loci significantly affects salinity tolerance capacity remains equivocal. the third and final novel candidate gene cluster was located on as-17q, where ghr and col1a <dig> are predicted to co-occur with a mapped nkcc locus
 <cit> . the linkage between nkcc <dig> and ghr is likely conserved among as-17qb, ac- <dig> in arctic charr, and rt-10p, rt-19q in rainbow trout, all of which are associated with salinity tolerance qtl. however, a segment on as-17qa is also syntenic with a region on ga-v that contains col1a <dig>  the segment of as-17qb bearing nkcc <dig> and ghr derives from the i teleost chromosome lineage, while the segment predicted to possess col1a <dig> on as-17qa would appear to derive from the d lineage
 <cit> . col1a <dig> duplicates are located on chromosomes ga-v and ga-xi in stickleback suggesting evolutionary origins to the e ancestral lineage of fishes. however, since both d and e chromosome blocks appear to show mosaic affinities with one another in model teleost species including salmonids
 <cit>  it is possible that similar regions exist on as-17qa that are currently undetected.

the positions of several other salinity tolerance qtl in atlantic salmon are consistent with the predicted locations of candidate genes. synteny of as-5/ <dig> with a segment containing casr on ga-vii suggests that duplicate copies of casr could underlie qtl on those linkage groups. multiple casr transcripts have been detected in atlantic salmon, however it remains unclear if they are transcribed from separate loci or represent a collection of alternate splicing variants transcribed from a single locus. similar patterns are evident in arctic charr, however, presently only ac- <dig> is syntenic with casr on ga-vii. this might be due to the low marker resolution of the arctic charr mapping panel or may suggest that only a single casr locus is conserved in arctic charr. in rainbow trout duplicate copies of casr appear to reside on rt-9p/20p. though neither of these linkage group arms is associated with a salinity tolerance qtl, a major smoltification qtl has been linked to rt-20q in rainbow trout
 <cit> , which shares a syntenic block with as-19q. this is particularly interesting as casr is an osmosensor that is upregulated during smoltification in atlantic salmon
 <cit> .

synteny with other salmonids and stickleback strongly suggests that a copy of gh is located on as-4q, where we detected the only genome-wide significant qtl for salinity tolerance. further, salinity tolerance qtl map to ac-20
 <cit>  and rt-9q
 <cit> , where gh has been mapped in arctic charr
 <cit>  and rainbow trout
 <cit> , respectively. these findings clearly suggest that these effects, which can tentatively be attributed to genetic variation at gh loci, are conserved in salmonids from three different genera. lastly, synteny with ga-iv suggests that a qtl on as-12p could be related to a sparc locus. this is corroborated by a qtl on rt-25p, which is also syntenic with the position of sparc on ga-iv. there is currently no synteny block in arctic charr that overlaps with sparc on ga-iv. however, we have tentatively assigned sparc to ac-6+ <dig>  as it is syntenic with a region that is proximal to sparc on ga-iv, although this region does not contain a reported salinity tolerance qtl
 <cit> .

candidate gene evolution in 3r and 4r genomes
the relative arrangements of candidate genes in the 4r derivative salmonids have for the most part remained unchanged from patterns in the reconstructed proto-actinopterygian 2r genome . unfortunately, the low resolution of genetic maps for salmonids has precluded a precise designation of synteny block boundaries on stickleback chromosomes. where such boundaries fell between candidate gene positions on 3r chromosomes we could not confidently designate the pertinent genes as unlinked in the 4r genome in question . therefore our predictions likely underestimate the extent that genomic rearrangements have altered the relative positions of candidate genes. nevertheless, our findings suggest several cases where candidate genes were paired in the 2r ancestor and remained so in both 3r and 4r genomes .

salinity tolerance candidate genes included in comparisons were: na+/k+-atpase α1b isoform , calcium-sensing receptor , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-like anion channel isoforms i and ii , claudin isoform 10e , collagen type  <dig> alpha  <dig>  and alpha  <dig> , growth hormone  <dig> and  <dig> , growth hormone receptor , insulin-like growth factors  <dig>  and  <dig> , na+/k+/2cl- isoform  <dig> , and secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine . synteny blocks were defined from comparative genomics of atlantic salmon , arctic charr , and rainbow trout  with the stickleback  genome. some genes have already been mapped in 4r genomes : atp1α1b
 <cit> ; gh
 <cit> ; igf <dig> and igf2
 <cit> ; nkcc1
 <cit> . mapped genes are included where synteny between 3r and 4r genomes is not apparent . in certain cases gene homology was assigned based on close proximity with atp1α1b  or igf <dig>  in the stickleback genome.

as-17pq, - <dig>  and − <dig> have homologous affinities with several regions of the stickleback genome which is consistent with findings that show these linkage groups are a product of multiple fusion and translocation events
 <cit> . accordingly, certain candidate genes that are unlinked in 2r and 3r genomes appear to be linked in unique combinations in atlantic salmon. for instance a cluster on as-17q  contains col1a <dig>  which is homologous with ga-v and derived from the 2r ancestral e grouping . similarly, nkcc1/ghr are homologous with 2r-i and ga-xiv. in addition, part of a conserved cluster on as- <dig>  is derived from 2r-c and homologous with ga-i, while the other part of the cluster  is derived from 2r-k and homologous with ga-iv. finally, igf/cftr duplicates may be linked with atp1α1b/cldn <dig> on as- <dig>  which has homeologous affinities with as- <dig>  igf2/cftr are derived from 2r-j/k and homologous with ga-xix. although large tracts of as- <dig> are currently unassigned to ancestral 2r origins, as- <dig> appears largely derived from 2r-c/k origins.

comparative synteny maps of atlantic salmon, arctic charr, and rainbow trout with the stickleback genome reveal that disparity in salinity tolerance capacity in salmonids is correlated with variation in genomic structure. though we found no difference in putative gene cluster patterns between arctic charr and rainbow trout, several factors lead to the hypothesis that unique gene clusters predicted for as-17q, - <dig>  and - <dig> could be related to the superior salinity tolerance capacity in atlantic salmon. this finding is consistent with observations that genes are not randomly arranged in eukaryotic genomes
 <cit> , but are instead arranged in clusters that tend to be coexpressed
 <cit>  and co-methylated
 <cit> . a logical prediction from such patterns is that the products of clustered genes would be involved in the same biochemical pathway
 <cit> . in terms of our results, this suggests that the benefit of unique candidate gene clusters on as-17q, - <dig>  and − <dig> could be that they are coexpressed, which posits a possible mechanism to explain patterns of increased anadromy in salmonids with reduced chromosome numbers
 <cit> . our hypothesis that the reduction in chromosome arm numbers in atlantic salmon could have consequences for salinity tolerance is consistent with patterns showing that this species possesses unique clusters of candidate genes. however, until it can be tested by gene mapping efforts and expression studies, this hypothesis will remain tentative.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified salinity tolerance qtl on multiple linkage groups in atlantic salmon. evidence from comparisons with arctic charr and rainbow trout indicates that some qtl may be conserved across species, suggesting that salinity tolerance in different salmonid species is to some extent controlled by the same loci. many qtl in atlantic salmon were on linkage groups that shared syntenic affinities with candidate gene locations in the stickleback genome. synteny maps revealed that candidate genes may often occur in pairs on chromosomes, patterns that were generally conserved in 2r, 3r and 4r genomes. however, we found evidence that three atlantic salmon linkage groups may contain larger syntenic combinations of candidate genes that are not evident in any of the other 2r, 3r or 4r genomes we examined. these putative novel candidate gene clusters could have resulted from ancestral chromosome arm tandem fusion events that resulted in the current atlantic salmon karyotype. finally, we hypothesized that the superior hypo-osmoregulatory efficiency that is characteristic of atlantic salmon could be related to these clusters. this hypothesis can be tested by gene mapping efforts and expression studies.
