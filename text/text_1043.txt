BACKGROUND
camptothecin  was first extracted from the stems of camptotheca acuminata in  <dig> and subsequently from nothapodytes foetida, ophiorrhiza pumila, and ophiorrhiza japonica  <cit> . cpt exhibits clinical anti-tumor activity by inhibiting dna topoisomerase i, an enzyme involved in dna recombination, repair, replication, and transcription  <cit> . cpt also inhibits the retroviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus  <cit> . despite its significant clinical use, the main source of cpt is still from its extraction from c. acuminata. however, the quantity is quite limited and cannot meet worldwide demand. studies on the molecular mechanism of cpt biosynthesis have long been hindered by the lack of transcriptome and genome information for c. acuminata and other cpt-producing plants. therefore, it is necessary to obtain transcriptome data and screen candidate transcripts involved in cpt biosynthesis to further understand the cpt biosynthetic pathway.

cpt is synthesized through a modified terpenoid indole alkaloid  pathway. the upstream biosynthesis pathways for all the tia products are similar among alkaloid-producing plants, and involve a strictosidine backbone . over recent decades, several enzymes in the process of strictosidine biosynthesis in c. acuminata have been isolated and functionally identified. among them are tryptophan synthase   <cit>  and tryptophan decarboxylase   <cit> , which are involved in the synthesis of the indole precursor tryptamine, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa synthase   <cit> , 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomeras   <cit> , and 10-hydroxy geraniol oxidoreductase   <cit>  are involved in secologanin synthesis.

g10h and scs, belonging to the cyp76b <dig> and cyp72a1subfamilies of cytochrome p <dig> family respectively, were identified in monoterpenoid biosynthesis from catharanthus roseus  <cit> . the synthesis of strictosidine is finally catalyzed by str, a committed enzyme for the cpt backbone biosynthesis, which was isolated and identified in rauvolfia serpentine, c. roseus, the cpt-producing plant o. japonica, and o. pumila, in previous studies. however, the genes encoding cag10h, cascs and castr, have not been yet cloned and characterized in c. acuminata.

the steps following strictosidine formation  are not very clear and only a proposed biosynthetic pathway based on relative compounds extracted from cpt-producing plants has been reported  <cit>  . in the proposed pathway, a series of oxidation and hydroxylation reactions are involved in some steps of the pathway which are probably catalyzed by monooxygenases and hydroxylase, belonging to the superfamily of cytochrome p450s  <cit> . meanwhile, the branch pathway of cpt biosynthesis is unique among tia pathways because strictosidine is not immediately deglycosylated as in c. roseus  <cit> . however, it requires a glucosidase for glycoside hydrolysis, which likely occurs in one of the last steps of cpt biosynthesis in c. acuminata and other cpt-producing plants. at present, the cyp450s and glucosidase involved in cpt biosynthesis have not been studied in c. acuminata.

glandular trichomes in leaves are the main site for cpt accumulation in c. acuminata  <cit> . however, gene expression involved in cpt synthesis was not detected in glandular trichomes but, instead, in epidermal cells and mesophyll cells in c. acuminata leaves, which implied the translocation of cpt between organs or cells  <cit> . multidrug resistance protein  transporters, belonging to the atp-binding cassette  transporter family, were reported to be responsible for uptake or secretion in alkaloid transportation in some plants  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that mdr transporters are responsible for cpt transportation from other cells to glandular trichomes in c. acuminata. at present, no cpt transport mechanism or related genes have been investigated in c. acuminata.

expressed sequence tags  analysis has been a primary tool for the discovery of novel genes, based on the traditional sanger sequencing principle, which is slow and costly for non-model species with little genomic information. the emergence of high throughput platforms, such as pyrosequencing technology  <cit> , enables comprehensive study of the transcriptome for various purposes, such as development study, mirna identification, and genetic polymorphisms discovery in plants and animals  <cit> . the roche/ <dig> gs flx platform, one of the high throughput sequencing platforms, offers the advantages of longer read length and lower cost which is especially suitable for de novo transcriptome sequencing aimed at gene discovery and analysis in a specific metabolic pathway  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that the content of cpt in young leaves is higher than that in old leaves and root  <cit> , suggesting that young leaf is an important tissue for the study of cpt biosynthesis and transport. therefore, cdna from c. acuminata young leaves was subjected to de novo transcriptome sequencing to uncover genes involved in cpt biosynthesis and transport, using a roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing platform, a next-generation sequencing system. based on the sequencing and analysis results, three important genes likely to be involved in the cpt biosynthesis were cloned and analyzed. from data analysis and expression analysis, six cytochrome p450s and one glucosidase gene were found to be candidate genes in the process of cpt biosynthesis. meanwhile, three mdr transporter genes were also found to be candidate genes involved in cpt transportation.

transcripts for proteins involved in the backbone biosynthetic pathway of cpt
putative strictosidine synthesis genes discovered in the dataset
strictosidine is the precursor and backbone of many tias, including cpts, in plants such as c. acuminata. a proposed biosynthetic pathway of strictosidine is shown in figure  <dig>  and each of the main enzymes present in the dataset is marked with a bold box . from the  <dig> data pool,  <dig> ests representing  <dig> enzyme genes involved in strictosidine biosynthesis were discovered. thirteen of these genes had not been previously reported, including the important enzymes geraniol-10-hydroxylase , secologanin synthase , and strictosidine synthase  . by searching the annotation information from the nr, swissprot, and kegg databases, we found that transcripts of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase , 10hgo, and scs were presented many ests, indicating that they are highly expressed in the young leaves of c. acuminata. g10h and tdc were both rare transcripts in the dataset, indicating that they are rarely expressed and are possibly rate-limiting genes in the tissue. the specific annotation information of some putative transcripts against the nr, swissprot and kegg databases is shown in the supporting information .

notes: a--total numbers when annotated against nr, swissprot and kegg databases.

g10h, scs, and str are the most important enzymes in the synthesis of strictosidine in tia-producing plants, including c. acuminata. crg10h, the first cyp <dig> in cpt synthesis, is a rate-limiting enzyme in the process of tia synthesis in c. roseus. in the  <dig> dataset, only one read of g10h was found and it had approximately 60% identical to the g10h gene of c. roseus and swertia mussotii. based on the est sequence, a putative g10h gene in c. acuminata  gene was cloned  and analyzed. similarity analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that capg10h shared 56% identity to crg10h, which implied it may have catalytic activity in geraniol hydroxylation process as in c. roseus . scs, the second cyp <dig>  is the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of secologanin. unigenes, assembled from  <dig> reads in our library, were annotated to the crscs. one putative scs gene in c. acuminata  was cloned , according to a contig that had annotated to the crscs gene. the molecular weight of the predicted protein was approximately  <dig> kda. protein subcellular localization prediction using the wolf psort program  <cit>  indicated that the presumed protein was likely targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum  membrane. protein alignment revealed that the predicted protein shared 68% amino acid identity to that in c. roseus, which is involved in a similar terpenoid indole alkaloids biosynthetic pathway . from the analysis, we inferred that the capscs gene may play a role in secologanin biosynthesis in c. acuminata. str is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of strictosidine synthesis. we cloned the orf of a putative str gene  from c. acuminata. phylogenetic analysis showed that str proteins from reported alkaloid-producing plants were clustered together, which implied that the candidate gene possibly plays a role in cpt biosynthesis .

expression analysis of transcripts for proteins involved in strictosidine synthesis
methyl jasmonate -induced accumulation of secondary metabolites and related gene expression has been reported in medicinal plants such as panax ginseng and c. roseus  <cit> . a previous report determined that the cpt content responded to meja and jasmonic acid, and that the response curve for jasmonic acid treatment was a waveform, with two time-specific cpt accumulation peaks in c. acuminata suspension cells  <cit> . however, there are few reports of the effect of meja treatment on the expression of genes of cpt biosynthesis in c. acuminata. in response to meja treatment, transcripts of g10h, scs and str were regulated in a waveform manner, including two expression peaks during  <dig> hours of induction . the trend of the curve was consistent with the result of a previous report for genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . in this study, all the detected genes responded to meja immediately, with a common peak within one hour of induction, and then decreased rapidly to even lower levels than the control. the expression levels increased again to the second peak, whose timing was gene-specific. therefore, we speculate that transcripts of cag10h, cascs, and castr were most likely to be involved in cpt biosynthesis. it has been reported that tdc genes, which are responsible for the production of tryptamine for auxin and cpts, do not respond to meja  <cit> . the expression of hmgr genes is even inhibited by meja in c. acuminata  <cit> . this is likely to be because the substrates of tdcs and hmgrs link primary and secondary metabolism, and their expression profiles are complicated.

previous reports had shown that young and actively growing tissues, showed the highest level of cpt  <cit> . in this study, the mrna levels of cag10h, cascs and castr were detected using real-time pcr. the results demonstrated that the expression levels of the three genes were all higher in young leaves and petioles than in old leaves . therefore, young leaves and young petioles are the possible sites of active cpt synthesis, as well as sites of accumulation, in c. acuminata compared with the mature tissues. this difference served as a standard for real-time pcr detection for downstream candidate gene selection  <cit> . meanwhile, the expression levels of these genes were also relatively lower in the root and root bark which implied that root may not be a main synthetic tissue. this was consistent with the expression pattern of the tdc <dig> and 10hgo genes reported in a previous study  <cit> .

transcripts for proteins likely to be involved in the branch pathway of cpt synthesis
strictosidine rapidly forms the intermediate product strictosamide in c. acuminata. the steps after strictosamide synthesis remain somewhat unclear. based on the proposed branch steps, an intermediate step between strictosamide and 3-pumiloside in the cpt biosynthetic pathway was presumed to be catalyzed by a cytochrome p <dig>  with another p <dig> possibly in the last steps of cpt biosynthesis . cytochrome p450s, are a large and complex superfamily, which play important roles through catalysis of oxidation and hydroxylation reactions. in c. acuminata, no cytochrome p <dig> involved in the downstream cpt biosynthetic pathway had been cloned and identified. after est annotation against the swissprot database,  <dig> putative cytochrome p <dig> transcripts were identified in the  <dig> ests pool , belonging to  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> subfamilies, according to the standard cyp family categories . according to clan classification, transcripts of cyp <dig> clan and cyp <dig> subfamilies are likely to be involved in secondary metabolism  <cit> . a total of  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> transcripts belonging to these two subfamilies were discovered as candidate genes for further screening. glucosidases, which is a superfamily involved in various biological process including cell wall assembly, polysaccharides, plant defense and secondary metabolism, catalyze the action of deglycosylation  <cit> . it had been reported that β-d-glucosidase plays a role in glycoside hydrolysis in tia biosynthesis in plants such as c. roseus  <cit> , psychotria ipecacuanha  <cit>  and r. serpentine  <cit> . in the  <dig> dataset, one transcript  annotated as strictosidine β-d-glucosidase in c. roseus  was identified with a predicted homologous peptide of  <dig> amino acids. the peptide was found to share 70% similarity to amino acids 47- <dig> of crsgd and 62% similarity to amino acids 18- <dig> of the β-d-glucosidase ipeglu <dig> of psychotria ipecacuanha , which is involved in ipecac alkaloid synthesis. when compared with raucaffricine-o-beta-d-glucosidase  and sgd  of another tia-producing plant, r. serpentine, these proteins showed 69% and  <dig> %  similarity, respectively. crsgd, rsrd, rssgd and ipeglu <dig> all belong to the glycosyl hydrolase  family, which catalyzes the deglycosylation reaction in the tia pathway, and their substrates are strictosidine, raucaffricine and n-deacetylipecoside, respectively. the predicted glucosidase peptide demonstrated high amino acid similarity with the glucosidases identified above as being involved in the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. therefore, capgd is likely to be a key enzyme in cpt synthesis through removal of a glucose moiety. analysis of the amino acids of the predicted peptide demonstrated that three key amino acids 161-his, 207-glu and 210-thr, which were key amino acids for catalytic activity  <cit> , are found in the corresponding residues of the predicted peptide of the pgd transcript in c. acuminata. the 388-trp was not included in the peptide.

after initial screening, relative expression analysis in young/old leaves of the  <dig> cytochrome p450s and the capgd was performed for c. acuminata. consequently, six cytochrome p <dig> transcripts and one capgd transcript that were shown to be expressed three-fold higher than the control were identified as candidate genes for participating in the branch pathway of cpt biosynthesis .

transcripts for proteins likely to participate in cpt transport
mdr is a subfamily of the abc transporter family that has been reported to be related to the transport of alkaloids metabolites  <cit> . from the annotated databases,  <dig> mdr transporters were found in the  <dig> abc transporter transcripts in the library. some of the transcripts were possibly responsible for cpt transport from synthesis site to the glandular trichomes in leaves through the plasma membrane  <cit> . previous studies showed that the cpt content was four to five-fold higher in young c. acuminata leaves compared with mature leaves  <cit> . it is possible that cpt transporters were more abundant in the young leaves than in mature ones  <cit> . subsequently, the  <dig> annotated mdr transporter transcripts were subjected to expression analysis in young leaves and old leaves of c. acuminata by real-time pcr. the results showed that the expression level of three transcripts  among the annotated mdr transporters were three-fold higher in young leaves than in the mature leaves. thus, they represent candidate genes for cpt transportation in leaves .

probable site of cpt biosynthesis
young leaves are the main site for cpt accumulation; therefore, this tissue was used to identify new genes in cpt biosynthetic pathway by high throughput sequencing. after assembly and annotation,  <dig> enzyme genes that act before the step of strictosidine synthesis were found in the dataset, including the key genes encoding g10h, scs and str. this result indicated that many putative genes in cpt synthesis are expressed in young leaves, which demonstrates that young leaves are likely to be active tissues for cpt biosynthesis as well as accumulation. expression profile analysis indicated that the biosynthesis of strictosidine may be more active in young leaves and petioles than in mature leaves and roots. this result indicates that cpt is likely to be synthesized in young leaves, which is consistent with a recent study  <cit> . young leaves and petioles are likely to be the main sites for cpt biosynthesis. the lower expression in roots implies that roots may not be a main tissue for cpt biosynthesis; however, cpt does accumulate in roots. therefore, our results support the hypothesis that in c. acuminata, the main cpt synthesis site is the young leaf.

the subcellular site for cpt synthesis in c. acuminata, has not been reported previously. in this study, we predicted that the cascs gene was localized in the er. the results indicated that secologanin in c. acuminata is possibly biosynthesized in the er, which was consistent with the studies of cpt location in hairy roots of o. pumila  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that in c. acuminata cpt is likely to be biosynthesized in the er and then transported to a vacuole  <cit>  or excreted outside the cytoplasmic membrane, as reported in o. pumila  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a high quality cdna library was established to mine effective transcriptome information in cpt biosynthesis and transport in c. acuminata. a method was adopted for gene discovery using a combination of sequence annotation, chemical catalytic features prediction and transcripts expression profiling for deep mining of target genes of the cpt metabolism pathway. consequently, a number of putative transcripts, including genes encoding g10h, scs, str, cytochrome p450s, glucosidase, and mdr transporter genes, were identified as possibly being involved in cpt biosynthesis and transport. meanwhile, three important genes encoding proteins involved in cpt backbone biosynthesis were cloned and analyzed. the transcriptome data represents a valuable genetic resource for further identification of genes involved in cpt biosynthesis and transport. this dataset could be beneficial for further research of the cpt metabolism pathway and molecular genetic breeding.
