BACKGROUND
malaria remains a major health problem worldwide with 35% of the human population being at risk of becoming infected  <cit> . the disease is caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus plasmodium, which reach their mammalian host through the bite of an infected female anopheles mosquito. the biological events that occur between the bite of a malaria-infected mosquito and the release of plasmodium merozoites into the bloodstream are obligatory steps in the establishment of a malaria infection. recently, our knowledge of the initial steps occurring in the skin immediately after mosquito bite increased . we now also have a greater understanding not only of how sporozoites traverse the liver sinusoids and reach the hepatocytes before invading a final cell and forming a parasitophorous vacuole  <cit> , but also of how, inside hepatocytes, the so-called exoerythrocytic forms  of the plasmodium parasite develop and multiply. there, eefs grow in size and undergo a series of morphological changes that culminates in the release of several thousand merozoites into the blood, where they will invade erythrocytes and cause the symptoms of the disease . this gain of knowledge was only possible due to recent advances in imaging technologies  <cit> , together with the development of tools for the genetic manipulation of plasmodium species  <cit> . however, in spite of these and other  <cit>  recent achievements little is known about the host molecules involved in plasmodium liver development. this gap in our understanding is mainly due to the fact that the proportion of infected hepatic cells is very low both in vitro and in vivo. the reasons why hepatocytes are able to provide an appropriate environment for sporozoite development remain generally unknown. given its clinically silent nature, the hepatic stage of plasmodium life cycle constitutes an ideal target for potential anti-malarial vaccines or prophylactic treatments  <cit> . therefore, it is important to identify host hepatic factors that may influence liver infection and to understand their underlying molecular mechanisms, as a means to impair the parasite's development in the liver. furthermore, an understanding of the molecular processes at play during the liver stage of malaria, may provide important information regarding the establishment and activation of hypnozoites, dormant forms of the parasite that occur with certain plasmodium species and that are capable of causing a subsequent relapse in infection.

we took a genome-wide microarray approach to look into the liver-parasite molecular interactions and obtain a time-dependent profile of the transcriptional landscape of murine hepatoma cells infected by plasmodium berghei sporozoites. hepatoma cell lines constitute an invaluable and widely used tool to study the molecular aspects of hepatic infection by plasmodium  <cit> . this transcriptional analysis of the host cell response to plasmodium infection and development revealed a coordinated and sequential set of biological events. we have identified several host genes and pathways with clearly modulated expression profiles as a result of infection and, thus, constitute a repertoire of novel host factors that are prime candidates for intervention strategies.

RESULTS
cell infection for microarray analysis
to understand the extent of host gene modulation by the murine model malaria parasite p. berghei anka, a mouse hepatoma cell line, hepa1- <dig>  was infected with sporozoites obtained from anopheles stephensi salivary glands, freshly dissected as previously described  <cit> . plasmodium sporozoite infection in vitro shows very low efficiency , with an average of  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % infected cells  in our chosen model. to overcome the "dilution effect" of infected cells by non-infected ones, hepa1- <dig> cells were infected with gfp-expressing p. berghei anka parasites  <cit>  and infected cells were purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection  to capture as many parasite-induced cellular events as possible: at  <dig> h p.i. the parasite starts to change its elongated sporozoite shape into a rounder form, which grows in size  and starts multiplying, with several nuclei present at  <dig> h p.i.; by  <dig> h p.i. sporozoite specific organelles are no longer visible and the parasite is bigger and round-shaped . the viability of sorted infected and non-infected cells was confirmed by microscopic observation of cells seeded on coverslips immediately after sorting and allowed to adhere for at least  <dig> hours .

global gene expression analysis of hepatoma cells during plasmodium infection
expression profiling of p. berghei anka-infected and non-infected hepa1- <dig> cells was performed at the four developmental time-points selected, using the mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array . to exclude potential false positives due to cross-hybridization of parasite rna with mouse probes, crna obtained from axenic cultures of p. berghei sporozoites  <cit>  at the same selected time points was pooled and hybridized as an extra sample on the mouse  <dig>  <dig>  array. no cross-hybridization was found in the list of genes differentially expressed  in p. berghei-infected cells with the parasite crna control array .

the experimental design aimed at two complementary goals:  identifying host genes de in plasmodium infected compared to non-infected hepatoma cells, and  following the patterns of differential expression across infection and parasite development within the cell. after robust normalization ~55% of the  <dig> probesets represented on the array were classified as present by the mas <dig>  software . empirical bayes moderated t-statistics  were used to detect up- and down-regulated transcripts in response to plasmodium infection at any of the four selected time-points. one thousand one hundred and seven probesets  representing  <dig> unique genes proved to be significantly de in at least one time point during the course of hepa1- <dig> cells infection by gfp+ p. berghei anka . this set of data was used in all subsequent analyses.

we used the expression values of each of the  <dig> transcripts for hierarchical clustering where each time point was plotted for non-infected and infected samples . different profiles can clearly be identified between cells that either have or have not been infected with sporozoites . two main clusters separate genes that are highly expressed as a result of malaria infection , while their expression in non-infected cells is relatively low , and vice versa. in addition, within the two large clusters, it is possible to identify smaller groups of probesets displaying an increasing  signal throughout time within both the infected and the non-infected cell categories . these changes indicate not only that malaria parasites modify the host cell transcriptome during the course of infection but also that they manipulate it in a timely fashion, presumably to fit their developmental needs.

in order to evaluate the overall structure of the data, we have plotted the first three principal components of a principal component analysis , capturing the overall variance of the samples in  <dig> dimensions . this analysis clearly separates the data into  <dig> subgroups, clustering together the biological replicates, segregating infected from non-infected cells, and separating the samples by time after infection. intriguingly, pca separates genes expressed at  <dig> h p.i. in infected cells  from those expressed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . in non-infected cells, early to mid-term cellular events  can be differentiated from later ones .

to validate the microarray results, we analyzed  <dig> transcripts by quantitative rt-pcr , selected for their top ranking positions on the de gene list at  <dig> h p.i.  or for their known function in the cell. correlation analysis was performed by comparing expression ratios from microarray results with the ratios determined by the qrt-pcr analysis . although the fold changes were under-estimated in the microarray results, a significant correlation was observed between the two assays .

overall, these results show more under-expressed than up-regulated genes in infected hepatoma cells ; seven hundred and eighty five transcripts are uniquely de at a single time point while  <dig> probesets are so in at least two time points . we also find that the number of de host genes steadily decreases, from  <dig> at  <dig> h p.i. to  <dig> at  <dig> h p.i. . these data suggest that host responses to parasite infection are more prominent at early time-points, causing more profound changes in gene expression during the initial stages of infection than during subsequent developmental processes occurring within the study's timeframe. in summary, our global analysis indicates that infection by plasmodium leads to a sequence of cellular events that involves both discrete and sustained expression modulation responses in the host cell, as well as responses that are controlled in a temporal fashion during parasite development .

time-course independent host cell responses to plasmodium infection
interestingly,  <dig> genes  playing a role in transcription/translation, transport, signaling, apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation, proteolysis, cytoskeleton, and steroid biosynthesis are de at all times in infected cells compared to non-infected ones . although no common pathway or gene ontology can be clearly identified for the whole set,  <dig> genes are up-regulated in all the time points assessed. they include three endoplasmic reticulum -stress related genes: trib <dig>  nupr <dig> and ddit <dig> that can act in concert to induce apoptosis under the right stimuli  <cit>  as shown during hepatitis c virus infection  <cit> . as a matter of fact two of these genes, trib <dig> and nupr <dig>  systematically ranked in the top  <dig> of genes de throughout parasite development . however, the same er-stress induced complex, involving atf <dig>  which binds to ddit <dig> through a dnazip binding domain, has been shown to regulate the heme oxygenase  <dig>  gene expression as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress  <cit> . interestingly, atf <dig> is also up-regulated in our analysis from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i, as is hmox- <dig> , suggesting a clear definitive and sustained response to oxidative stress caused by the parasite . those er-stress induced factors are attractive candidates to stimulate hmox- <dig> expression, which we have shown to promote p. berghei liver infection  <cit> . trib <dig> has also a clear negative modulatory effect on the insulin signaling pathway in hepatocytes that is responsible for glucose homeostasis  <cit> . whether these metabolic pathways are important for plasmodium development inside the hepatocyte remains to be elucidated.

it is also compelling to find that some host molecules are down-regulated in infected cells throughout the entire period of the experiment. among those  <dig> transcripts, there are:  <dig> g-protein coupled receptors, which have a role in signal transduction; protein c, which is a regulator of the blood coagulation cascade; maf, which encodes an oncoprotein promoting cell differentiation; and  <dig> solute carriers, mct <dig> and zip <dig>  which, if down-modulated, have been shown respectively to help restore calcium homeostasis  <cit>  and impair mitochondrion function in response to tnfÎ±  <cit> . mct <dig> and zip <dig> rank in the top  <dig> de genes in our analysis, along with an abc transporter  that is also down-regulated during the whole course of parasite development, and trib <dig> and nupr <dig>  that are up-regulated at all the time points assessed .

time-course specific host cell responses to plasmodium infection
to characterize all the de transcripts biologically, an enrichment analysis of modulated genes by their functional annotation with gene ontology  and kegg metabolic pathways was performed at each time point .

according to the goslim analysis, most receptor binding activity, as well as stress and stimulus response-related genes, are modulated by the parasite in the early stages of infection. . on the other hand, this analysis further shows that metabolic processes are then engaged at a later stage of the infection process. . the early responses are possibly mediated by cytokine and subsequent pro-inflammatory signaling events  that, in turn, induce fast cell cycling, as indicated by the kegg metabolic pathways specifically enriched at  <dig> h p.i. . this type of response is somewhat similar to that of human foreskin fibroblasts  infected by toxoplasma gondii where both stress and cytokine/chemokine host genes are de in the early stages of infection  <cit> . in t. gondii infection this response seems to be triggered by induction of il-1Î² and tnf-Î± and followed by the jak/stat <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . however, in p. berghei-infected cells only tnf signaling is significantly modulated. both tnfaip <dig> and tnfaip <dig> are up-regulated at  <dig> h p.i. and tnf receptors are down-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. . neither jak nor stat <dig> are in our final list of de genes  although stat5a is up-regulated at  <dig> h p.i. and jak <dig> is down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i., albeit not significantly. thus,, it is not clear from the present experiment whether malaria parasites modulate the jak/stat <dig> pathway as happens during toxoplasma infection  <cit> .

similarly to t. gondii  <cit> , p. berghei parasites manipulate host cell nf-Îºb signaling. nf-Îºb transcription factors have been proposed to act as a "first responder" to the cellular stimuli caused by traversal of host cells by plasmodium prior to invasion  <cit> . to identify targets or interacting molecules, we cross-checked the repertoire of cytokines and chemokines produced by infected liver cells with known target genes of nf-Îºb . ccl <dig>  a member of the cc subfamily of chemokines, is up-regulated throughout parasite development and ccl <dig>  is up-regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i . cxcl <dig> , and cxcl <dig> are members of the cxc subfamily of chemokines that are also up-regulated, from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. or at all time points, respectively . additional nf-Îºb-induced factors de at early stages of infection include cell adhesion molecules icam <dig>  and vcam <dig>  as well as the transcription factors nfkb1b and nfkb1z .

interestingly, it has been previously shown that t. gondii also manipulates the mapk signaling pathway through lps/tlr <dig> engagement  <cit> . although in the present experiment none of the toll-like receptors were de, the mapk pathway seems to be up-regulated through the production of gadd45Î±/Î² and Î³ from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. , mkp from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. and ikk from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. . the mapk pathway was also shown to be up-regulated in b-type hepatocellular carcinoma and during hepatitis b virus  infection  <cit> , indicating that up-regulation of signal transduction-related genes is not pathogen-specific. this suggests that cell traversal or invasion by sporozoites may engage several host receptors and that these events constitute, perhaps not surprisingly, a stress-inducing stimulus for the cells, leading to a cascade of signaling events through chemokines and cytokines that might have positive or negative effects on the establishment of the liver infection. in fact, one such gene is hmox- <dig>  which is up-regulated in infected cells at all the time points assessed, significantly so at  <dig> h p.i. , as well as in macrophages and kupffer cells in the liver  <cit> . as mentioned above, hmox- <dig> is a major stress-response molecule that we have shown to promote liver infection by controlling the extent of the host inflammatory response  <cit> . interestingly, hmox- <dig> has pronounced antiviral activity in hbv infection  <cit>  while it can promote mycobacterium tuberculosis latent infection in host  <cit> .

at  <dig> h p.i., with  <dig> de genes, the parasite seems to primarily modulate the host cell's transcriptome towards biosynthetic pathways including carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. this correlates well with host responses observed during early t. gondii infection that has been reported to be a general reaction to stress rather than a specific parasite induced response  <cit> . genes involved in cellular homeostasis, transport and cell communication are also modulated following productive invasion.

at  <dig> h of parasite development  <dig> de genes playing a role in lipid metabolism , amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism , as well as cell cycle  and catalytic activity  are significantly modulated . this picture may suggest that once a host cell is successfully infected by plasmodium, its resources remain engaged in energy production and homeostasis, possibly in an attempt to cope with the imbalance caused by the intracellular presence of the parasite. indeed, the liver stage parasite goes through an extensive proliferative phase during this period, likely requiring large amounts of proteins and lipids to produce tens of thousands of merozoites that will in turn invade the red blood cells . consistent with this notion, our analysis shows that the parasite's presence down-modulates signaling trough the ppar and adipocytokine pathways around  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i.  leading to increased lipid metabolic processes . it has been described that a parasitophorous vacuole membrane protein encoded by the parasite, uis <dig>  specifically binds to the liver-fatty-acid binding protein   <cit> . by engaging l-fabp, the parasite would reduce ppar activity, resulting in an increase in fatty acids available to it. as such, it is tempting to speculate that the parasite influences host cell metabolism in its own interest. also, transport molecules are engaged from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i whether this is important to provide the developing parasite with the components it requires for its rapid proliferation and/or host cell survival remains to be established .

at  <dig> h p.i., with  <dig> de genes, glutathione metabolism is the major host pathway modulated by the parasite . glutathione metabolism and transport participate in many cellular reactions including antioxidant defence of the cell, drug detoxification and cell signalling . alterations in glutathione concentration have also been shown to be a common feature of many pathological conditions including diabetes, cancer, aids, neurodegenerative and liver diseases  <cit> . therefore, one can speculate that the parasite stimulates the glutathione pathway to help sustain the host cell in the final stages of development.

finally, it is interesting to note that genes involved in cell differentiation and death, through the p <dig> signalling pathway, are de throughout the whole time span covered in this study . from the earliest stages of infection, cell survival and apoptosis mechanisms are actively at play . malaria hepatic infection involves the activation of the tyrosine kinase hgf receptor  by secreted hgf  <cit>  and down modulation of met leads to a decrease in infection  <cit> . in our analysis, met is over-expressed at  <dig> h p.i . it has been shown that the malaria parasite exploits met not as a primary binding site, but as a mediator of signals that make the host susceptible to infection. this signalling pathway might influence host actin cytoskeleton  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit>  during infection  and play an important role in the survival of the infected cell. indeed, p. berghei-infected hepatocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by different stimuli throughout infection  <cit> , and require an actively developing parasite  <cit> . hence, one might therefore suggest that pro- and anti-apoptotic genes are actively modulated throughout infection, in a constant struggle between the infected cell's tendency to undergo apoptosis and the parasite's need for the host cell to survive .

similarities between the rodent malaria species p. yoelii and p. berghei
a complementary in vivo assay was carried out on liver cells from mice infected with p. yoelii at  <dig> h, when most liver stage parasites are at a small early schizont stage and have undergone two to four rounds of nuclear division, and  <dig> h p.i., when most liver stage parasites are large late schizonts and have undergone up to  <dig> rounds of nuclear division  <cit> , and compared to the findings described above. we found that 67% of genes de in p. berghei-infected hepa1- <dig> cells are also expressed in p. yoelii-infected livers. although parasite development in cell culture and in vivo is known to proceed at different rates  <cit> , and two different microarray platforms were used, for two different parasites species, a sizeable 42% of the genes de in p. berghei infected cells are also found de in p. yoelii-infected livers in at least one time point . twenty-six transcripts are found de in both experiments with the highest agreement in terms of up or down-modulation  and common time point  . it is reassuring to find that some of those transcripts have been discussed above as identified in top ranking positions during p. berghei infection and include ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  g protein-coupled receptor gpr137b, and gpr <dig>  nr4a <dig>  abcd <dig>  hmox- <dig> and klf <dig>  these findings corroborate the validity and strength of our in vitro model, and highlight those genes or the pathways they are involved in as common and important factors in host response to rodent parasites.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have used a microarray-based approach to profile the host cell response to a malaria sporozoite infection in a time course experiment. our data shows that host cell response to plasmodium can broadly be divided into  <dig> major components, including an initial stress response to the presence of the parasite, a subsequent engagement of host cell metabolic processes and a constant management of host cell viability. our data suggest that, following an initial stage in which the infected cells respond to the stress caused by the presence of the parasite, the outcome of infection may depend on the parasite's ability to engage the cell's resources to its own benefit thereby fulfilling its molecular needs for multiplication. on the other hand, plasmodium seems to influence the host cell's survival for as long as the parasite requires an intracellular shelter for expansion. targeting host factors during the initial stages of parasite development has already proven to modulate the fate of infection  <cit> . our data reveal, for the first time, a number of host genes, from modulators of the immune system to genes involved in lipid metabolism, which may constitute possible targets for future drug development strategies. it is therefore tempting to speculate that those genes may constitute possible candidates for the design of new strategies for future anti-malarial intervention. indeed, targeting host proteins specifically required for infection/maintenance of the parasite, but non-essential to the host itself, holds several key advantages. most importantly it offers inherently lower susceptibility of those drugs to induce resistance in the parasite, arguably the biggest problem faced in all infectious disease fields today. furthermore, targeting host factors also offers much higher potential for accelerated therapeutics discovery or development through synergies with ongoing output from mainstream disease pipelines. host proteins are more likely to have been the focus of previous or even ongoing therapeutic development work in other fields, thus opening the possibility of finding anti-malarial activities as second medical uses for existing drugs.
