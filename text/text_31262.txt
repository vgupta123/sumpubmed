BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions are a key element of life processes. thus better understanding of these interactions, coupled with our ability to model them, is essential for the fundamental knowledge of their biology and the multitude of biomedical applications.

computational approaches to structural determination of protein-protein complexes  typically involve two steps: the global, often low-resolution, search within a computationally feasible timeframe to detect a set of matches that includes at least one near-native structure , and the local refinement of the matches from the scan stage that may involve more computationally expensive protocols. such refinement often includes scoring aimed at improving the rank of the near-native structure relative to the false-positive matches.

knowledge-based potentials  <cit> , physics-based potentials  <cit> , and the hybrid potentials  <cit>  have been shown to perform successfully in protein-protein docking benchmark tests. however, the limited ranking ability of the current scoring functions in capri  <cit>  suggests that much work still has to be done.

in structure prediction of individual proteins, the knowledge-based scoring functions gained significant popularity  <cit> . it has been shown that knowledge-based pairwise atomic potentials perform better than the physics-based potentials in the near-native structure refinement  <cit> .

an essential element of knowledge-based potentials is defining the reference state for the optimal description of residue-residue  pairs in the non-interaction state. for protein-protein interactions, generally, there are three methods of defining the non-interaction state. the first one is based on the large-distance cutoffs , the second one is based on random mixing of residue or atom types , and the third one is based on false-positive matches/decoys . our approach utilizes reference states based on protein-protein decoys. it was shown that the long-range cooperative interactions  <cit>  play an important role in protein-protein association. however, they are difficult to model based on contact or physics-based potentials. on the other hand, the coarse-grained distance-dependent potentials are a simple way to capture the long-range residue-residue interaction. in this paper we present a new distance- and environment-dependent, coarse-grained, knowledge-based  potential for scoring of protein-protein docking predictions.

RESULTS
coarse-grained statistical potentials were developed, based on pseudo-atoms at the geometric center of the side chains, with five different reference states. the potentials were trained on sets of unbound and bound protein-protein complexes . to select the optimal reference state, the scoring functions were tested on gramm-x decoy set  <cit> . the success rate for each scoring function for the  <dig> complexes in the set is shown in figure  <dig>  the success rate was calculated as the percentage of complexes with at least one hit ranked in top n. a hit was defined as a match with ligand rmsd < <dig> Å. the success rates in figure  <dig> provide a clear comparison of the five reference states, with the reference state  <dig> yielding the highest success rates overall, especially for the smaller top n values. thus, further results in this study were obtained with the potentials based on this reference state.

our potentials are distance-dependent by design. in the development of distance-dependent potentials, the choice of the distance cutoff is an important consideration. earlier studies investigated the cutoff effect in protein-protein energy landscapes  <cit> . for a long-range potential, such as soft lennard-jones,  <dig> Å cutoff was suggested. this value is close to the cutoff  <dig>  Å in dfire  <cit> . in an iterative knowledge-based scoring function for protein-protein recognition, cutoff distance was set to  <dig> Å  <cit> . in the current study, for the scoring function with the reference state  <dig>  cutoffs from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å were used to check the cutoff effect on the success rate for the gramm-x decoys. the success rates were calculated for a set of top n criteria . the results show a decrease of the success rate for cutoffs > <dig> Å. this value is close to the cutoff values in itscore  <cit> . the cutoff between  <dig> and  <dig> Å has little effect on the success rate. thus, along with the distance-dependent potentials, we tested a contact potential, based on the reference state  <dig>  which included a single  <dig> - 8Å bin.

the potentials were tested on the zdock <dig> +zrank decoys developed in weng's lab  <cit> . zdock <dig>   <cit>  implements fft docking based on shape complementarily, electrostatics, and pairwise contact potentials. zrank  <cit>  is an optimized energy function, which includes van der waals, electrostatics and pairwise atomic contact energy. the dataset included  <dig> complexes with  <dig>  decoys each. at least one near-native hit  was present in  <dig> complexes. the tested potentials were: deck  <dig> and deck  <dig> , contact potential , and dcomplex. the results were compared with zrank values from the score file in the decoys set. the success rates are shown in figure 3a. overall, zrank showed the best results, except deck  <dig> in the top  <dig> predictions. deck  <dig> was better than contact potential and dcomplex for all top n predictions.

a test was also performed on rosettadock  <cit>  unbound docking decoy set from gray lab. the set includes  <dig> complexes. each complex has top  <dig> structures from the global search based on unbound structures with rebuilt side chains. this decoy set represents another important facet of protein docking. the zdock <dig> +zrank set has the rigid body docking output, which typically contains a large number of matches for further structural refinement. the rosettadock set contains the structures with optimized side-chain conformations, representing an expected output of a flexible structure refinement. such a refinement is computationally expensive and thus has a significantly smaller number of matches, which are meant to be structurally more accurate than the rigid-body docking output.

deck  <dig> and  <dig>  and contact potential were tested and compared with rosettadock, dcomplex and zrank score values. the rosettadock score values were obtained from the file in the decoy set. the scores of dcomplex and zrank were computed locally. with a hit defined as a match with ligand rmsd < <dig> Å,  <dig> of  <dig> complexes had at least one hit. the results are shown in figure 3b. if the hit was redefined as a match with ligand rmsd < <dig> Å,  <dig> of  <dig> complexes in the decoy set had at least one hit. figure 3c shows the results according to this definition. as the results indicate, in both cases, deck  <dig> outperformed other potentials across all top n predictions.

an important activity in the field of protein-protein docking is a community-wide experiment on critical assessment of predicted interactions . this experiment allows a comparison of different computational methods on a set of prediction targets . the community of predictors is provided with the coordinates of the separate components of the complex, which they use for the docking and scoring. after the models are submitted by the docking predictors, they are made available to 'scorer' groups to re-rank them and submit their own  <dig> best-ranking matches  <cit> . the deck potential was tested in the capri scoring experiment. according to the capri assessment criteria, it identified two 'acceptable' models for target  <dig>  four 'medium' models for target  <dig>  four 'medium' and three 'acceptable' models for target  <dig>  and one 'acceptable' model for target  <dig>  target  <dig> was a complex between subtilisin savinase and α-amylase subtilisin inhibitor. the distribution of the top  <dig> models for this target is shown in figure  <dig> .

the scoring procedure implementing deck is available from the authors upon request .

discussion
the knowledge-based potentials improve modeling of protein complexes by taking advantage of the rapidly increasing amount of experimentally derived information on protein-protein association. the distance dependence of these potentials is supposed to provide a more accurate description of protein-protein interactions by taking into account the structural and physicochemical aspects of the interacting proteins within a broader scope than the immediate contact across the interface. the coarse-graining of the potentials makes them less sensitive to the structural inaccuracies of the proteins, which are unavoidable for unbound x-ray and potentially modeled proteins, especially in high-throughput applications to large interaction networks.

five reference states for the coarse-grained, distance-dependent, knowledge-based potentials were used in this study. similar reference states in earlier studies focused on protein structure prediction and protein folding  <cit> . we applied a similar form of the potential to protein-protein docking, redefining the reference states based on the non-native matches . the larger number of non-native matches models random protein-protein binding with reasonable accuracy. the long range interactions were accounted for by incorporating the structural environment of the interacting residues. docking decoys were used as a reference state earlier in dars potentials  <cit> . however, our method differs in three key points. the first one is the detailed form of the potential. dars is based on the mole fraction potential, uniform reference state, and atomic contact potentials  <cit>  . in our method, the reference states  <dig> and  <dig> also include the mole fraction terms. however, they also incorporate the probability of finding residue types at a certain distance  <cit> . the second point is the way to calculate the observed and the expected probabilities of residue pairs. the observed probability of dars is based on the native structure. in our study, the observed probability based on the native structure made the results worse when tested on gramm-x decoys . the main reason was the limited number of nonredundant protein-protein interfaces. so, in our approach the near-native matches were used instead of the native complexes. the dars approach used  <dig>  best scoring matches  for calculating the reference probabilities. we used ~ <dig>  best scoring matches without the near-native hits for calculating the expected probability in each case. the third point is the resolution. our method is coarse-grained. because in this work we do not integrate our potential in the fft search, a direct comparison of the results is difficult. however, both studies show that the reference states based on decoys perform better than the ones based on mole fraction terms. overall, the results show that the scoring function deck can successfully identify near-native protein-protein matches and thus is useful in protein docking.

CONCLUSIONS
scoring of predicted protein-protein matches is important for identification of near-native structures in a pool of models. knowledge-based scoring schemes improve modeling of protein complexes by taking advantage of the rapidly increasing amount of experimentally derived information on protein-protein association. a choice of the reference state for the description of non-interacting residue or atom pairs is an essential element of the knowledge-based potentials. the study presents a new potential for scoring of protein-protein docking predictions. training sets of protein-protein matches were generated based on the bound and unbound proteins from the dockground resource. each residue was represented by a pseudo-atom in the geometric center of the side chain. to capture the long-range and the multi-body interactions, residues in different secondary structure elements at protein-protein interfaces were considered as different residue types. five reference states for the potentials were defined and tested. the optimal reference state was selected and the cutoff effect on the distance-dependent potentials investigated. the potentials were validated on the docking decoys sets, showing better performance than the existing potentials used in scoring of protein-protein docking results. the study also provides insights into the relative utility of the reference states, the scope of the distance dependence and the coarse-graining of the potentials.
