BACKGROUND
the european eel  is a catadromous fish species with a complex life cycle conditioned by marine  and continental  environments. current available information indicates that the overall stock is at an historical minimum in most of the distribution area and continues to decline, while fishing mortality is still high both on juveniles  and adults   <cit> . at present, recruitment is dramatically low, with a sharp and widespread reduction by 90-99% as compared to recruitment prior to  <dig>  <cit> . several hypotheses have been put forward concerning the causes of the eel stock decline, including anthropogenic factors affecting eels during their continental phase of the life-cycle  and climatic events affecting eels during the oceanic phase  <cit> . the european eel was included in  <dig> in appendix ii of the convention on international trade of endangered species  and was listed in  <dig> as critically endangered in the iucn red list of threatened species http://www.iucnredlist.org. a management framework for the recovery of the european eel stock was established in  <dig> by the council of the european union through a dedicated regulation  for eel recovery and sustainable use of the stock requiring the preparation of national eel management plans from any member states. current demand for eels cannot be met by fisheries and relies on aquaculture instead, based on wild-caught juvenile eels as artificial reproduction of the species is not yet feasible  <cit> .

from this perspective, an evaluation of european eel population genetic structure, genetic diversity, effective  population size, and possible evolutionary responses to anthropogenic environmental stress is crucial. traditionally, these issues have been addressed by studying a limited number of markers due to the shortage of genomic sequence resources available for eels. no genome sequencing have been conducted for any anguillid species so far and all the species within the genus anguilla are still poorly characterized at the molecular level. for the species a. anguilla only  <dig> proteins are available. similarly, only  <dig> ests and  <dig> nucleotide sequences are known, the latter including the complete mitochondrial genome , encoding  <dig> peptides.

next-generation sequencing techniques such as  <dig> pyrosequencing methodology allow for a massive characterization of expressed genes  <cit> . a complete characterization of expressed sequence tags  provides an overview of the transcriptome, i.e. those genes expressed in a given tissue at a given time  <cit> . initially, pyrosequencing was restricted to model organisms  <cit>  because of the short reads  produced that make de novo genome assembly difficult without a reference genome. however, the more accurate base calling and deeper sequencing coverage of the  <dig> approach means that transcribed genes of non-model organisms can be characterized without a pre-existing sequence reference. recently,  <dig> pyrosequencing has been successfully applied to large-scale est sequencing in non-model organisms  <cit> , including insects  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and corals  <cit> . in fish, characterized transcriptomes include the whitefish corenogus clupeaformis  <cit> , the eelpout zoarces viviparus  <cit> , the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens  <cit>  and the cichlid amphilophus sp.  <cit> . pyrosequencing of ests can be used to characterize gene expression, discover and identify new genes, providing a rich data resource for identification of novel type i genetic markers  for quantitative trait locus  and population genomic analyses. up till now, only  <dig> ests are available for the japanese eel  <cit>  and  <dig> ests for the european eel  <cit> . more recently, est sequencing of a normalized a. anguilla cdna library produced by the european marine genomics network of excellence allowed to obtain  <dig>  ests , used for the identification of putatively selected microsatellites markers  <cit> .

the non-coding portion of the transcriptome has been largely neglected in studies focusing on non-model organisms despite its emerging biological importance and the continuous discovery of novel classes of functional non-coding rnas  <cit> . as an example, micrornas  are small non-coding rnas playing an important role in the regulation of gene expression in a wide range of biological processes, including cell differentiation, organogenesis and development, which have been found in a wide range of organisms, from plants to viruses and vertebrates . the majority of fish mirnas have been characterised in model species , with the exception of rainbow trout  <cit> .

here we present the european eel transcriptome, obtained by  <dig> flx titanium sequencing of over  <dig>  ests from a normalized cdna library, and assembly of reads in about  <dig>  contigs, representing bona fide individual transcripts. an innovative aspect of our study is the identification of putative european eel mirna sequences, by comparing reconstructed contig sequences with known metazoan mirnas hairpin precursor sequences. in summary, 36% of contigs were annotated by similarity to known protein or nucleotide sequences, plus  <dig> contigs matching mirnas sequences known in different species were identified. a database  has been established that provides the first picture of the genomic transcriptional activity of this economically important but endangered species. the database will be updated in the future, if additional data becomes available.

RESULTS
contigs assembly and validation
a normalised cdna library obtained from pooling equimolar amounts of total rna from  <dig> glass eels was sequenced using the  <dig> titanium platform. a single sequencing run from a single region produced  <dig>  reads, with an average sequence length of  <dig> nucleotides .

using mira  <dig>  sequence reads were assembled into contigs, representing european eel transcripts. a first run of assembly using  <dig>  reads  produced a total of  <dig>  sequences, consisting of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig> singlets. the large majority of contigs  were assembled with high confidence, while the remaining  <dig>  contigs were assembled despite the absence of a starting region covered by an "anchor" read with long overlap with many other reads. plots in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> describe the distributions of length and average quality over all assembled sequences, and illustrate pair-wise relations between main sequence properties .

properties of contig sequences  obtained by the first run of assembly and  included in the final set representing the european eel transcriptome.

due to the heuristic nature of the assembly process and previous reports of redundancy  in sets of transcriptome contigs assembled with different methods  <cit> , a second run of assembly was conducted using the previously obtained contigs and singlets as input. in this way, one quarter of contigs  were further assembled in  <dig>  meta-contigs, with an increase of the average length from  <dig>  to  <dig> nucleotides . on average, meta-contigs included  <dig>  contigs  and were covered by  <dig>  reads.

a total of  <dig>  sequences were obtained by merging all meta-contigs with the contigs and singlets from the first assembly not included in any meta-contig. the number of contigs remained stable over further reassembly , which suggests that most redundancy had been eliminated. a further quality check was conducted for the final set of putative transcripts by selecting only those sequences at least  <dig> nucleotide long and with a minimum average sequence quality of  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts were obtained , with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides and an average sequence quality of  <dig> . transcripts included information derived from  <dig>  original reads, with an average of  <dig>  reads per transcript. the gc content in the transcripts ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with a mean value of  <dig> % .

figure in additional file  <dig> shows the distribution of sequence length and average quality in the final set of contigs. all contigs were aligned with the set of original reads from which they were assembled, generating multiple alignments in ace format. these were included in the database and might be useful for future identification of intra- and inter-specific sites of genetic variation .

to our knowledge, no general criteria have been proposed as standard for quality evaluation of de novo transcriptome assembly. in this sense, three aspects can be regarded as substantial for assessing how well the sample of assembled contig sequences represents the actual transcriptome population:  gene coverage,  transcript sequence quality and  completeness.

 first, we compared the ratio between number of genes and transcripts in zebrafish danio rerio and stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus. a recent paper by lu et al.  <cit>  showed that rates of alternative splicing vary among teleost species, in terms of fraction of genes with alternative transcripts  and average number of splicing events per gene , resulting in a different ratio between transcripts and genes . under the hypothesis that the number of genes and the transcripts/genes ratio in a. anguilla is similar to that estimated for stickleback, which is reasonable considering the highly duplicated nature of zebrafish genome  <cit> , the total of  <dig>  european eel transcripts would represent about  <dig>  genes, with at best about 70% gene coverage.

the transcriptome gene coverage was estimated by comparison with the available sequence information for a. anguilla. all  <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding genes previously described in european eel were present in the assembled contigs. moreover, regarding the  <dig> known a. anguilla protein sequences,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> different proteins  were found in the transcriptome. these two estimations might be inaccurate because of the limited numbers of sequences used for comparison, mostly belonging to highly and/or constitutively expressed genes. by contrast, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> glutathione peroxidase genes known in zebrafish are found in the eel transcriptome. while  <dig> genes of two small families of iroquois homeobox proteins are found in zebrafish, only  <dig> contigs/ <dig> putative genes are represented in the eel transcripts. for atpase genes, a large family in vertebrates with over  <dig> genes in zebrafish, only  <dig> contigs/ <dig> putative genes were present in the eel transcriptome.

however, coverage values in the european eel transcriptome might not be comparable to zebrafish, the genome of which is characterized by high rates of gene duplications  <cit> , which might correspond to a considerable increase in gene family size in comparison with other species. a moderate to low gene coverage can also be attributable to tissue/life stage-specific and/or weakly expressed gene transcripts, which might be applicable to our study in which the cdna library was produced using a single life-stage .

 transcriptome sequence quality was evaluated by comparing the mitochondrial protein-coding genes found in the assembled contigs with the mitochondrion sequence in genbank . a total of  <dig>  nucleotide identities were observed out of  <dig>  total nucleotide length of contig to genome blast matches, suggestive of good transcriptome sequence quality. the observed 1% sequence difference might be due to either intraspecific genetic variability and/or sequencing errors affecting assembled mtdna sequences.

 finally, in terms of sequence completeness, the estimation of the fraction of full-length sequences in the transcriptome was obtained. a sequence is considered full-length when it comprises the complete 5' and 3' sequences of the mrna. in this study, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition, considering a sequence as full length when it contains at least the complete coding sequence . using the software full-lengther, 54% of predicted transcripts were validated as full-length  or putative full-length . approximately 25%  presented at least a significant blast match  with nucleotide  or protein  sequences. the remaining 75%  were not similar to any known sequence but their longest orf fitted the full-lengther criteria . among the  <dig>  transcripts considered as non full-length by the software,  <dig>   showed blast matches. thus, at least 66% of all contigs  could be successfully annotated by similarity and/or contained a complete cds.

functional annotation by similarity
de novo annotation of the european eel transcriptome, both for the coding and for the non-coding fraction of transcripts, was obtained by a multistep procedure, starting with similarity search against main protein and nucleotide sequence databases, as detailed below.

blastx against protein sequence databases
transcript sequences were compared by blastx against nr database of peptide sequences, the most comprehensive and well annotated collection of proteins, thus identifying significant similarity with known proteins for  <dig>  transcripts . in total,  <dig>  nr hits were identified, with an average of  <dig> hits per transcript. figure  <dig> shows the european eel contigs vs nr protein database blast e-values analysis, in relation to the annotated status of contigs. eukaryotes accounted for  <dig> % of all blast hits, while teleost fish accounted for  <dig> % of hits . among fish, zebrafish danio rerio and salmon salmo salar represented about 50% of all the hits, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  hits, respectively.

considering alignment coverage between query and subject sequences, aligned regions covered on average  <dig> % of contigs length: 75% of contigs were aligned with subject sequences for more than  <dig> % of their length, and 25% for more than  <dig> % of their length. aligned regions covered on average  <dig> % of subject sequence  length, whereas three quarters of aligned regions covered over  <dig> % of subject sequence length. the majority of contig/transcript sequences  were not associated to nr blast hits. comparison of sequence length, quality and gc content of the set of sequences with and without nr blast hits showed highly significant differences : annotated sequences were longer and of higher quality than non-annotated sequences, and gc content of the two sets was on average about  <dig> percent points higher in annotated sequences.

in parallel, blastx search with the swissprot set of uniprot protein sequences identified significant similarity with known proteins for  <dig>  transcripts  with a total of  <dig>  hits, with  <dig> hits per transcript on average. only  <dig> contigs, not previously annotated by similarity using nr database, were included in the set of  <dig>  contigs with swissprot blast hits. merging the results of the two blast searches,  <dig>  transcripts  resulted to be similar to at least one known protein sequence in uniprot or nr database, with adopted settings.

blast against nucleotide sequence databases
transcript sequences were also compared by blastn against nt database of nucleotide sequences, identifying significant similarity for  <dig>  transcripts . in total,  <dig>  nt hits were identified, with an average number of  <dig> hits per transcript. a group of  <dig>  contigs without hits after blastx searches resulted to be similar to nt sequences.

in summary, a total of  <dig>  contigs with at least one hit after all the blast searches were identified, which represent 36% of the transcriptome.

functional annotation
blastx with nr database was chosen as most informative and used as starting point for the functional annotation analysis conducted with the blast2go suite. among contigs with nr blastx hits,  <dig>   were associated to one or more  <dig>  unique go terms, for a total of  <dig>  term occurrences. after merging go annotations to eliminate redundancy,  <dig> % of contigs resulted to be associated to go terms. the number of go terms per annotated contig is reported in figure 3a. in order to give a broad overview of the ontology content, go classes were grouped into go-slim terms, which are cut-down versions of the go ontologies containing a subset of the terms in the whole go. using the web tool categorizer, go classes were grouped into a total of  <dig> go-slim terms , which included biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  ontologies. among biological processes, cellular, regulatory and development processes represented 95% of the total, while other key processes like growth or reproduction were also present. binding represented about 70% of the molecular function terms.

sequence and annotation information included in eeelbase might be valuable for the study of european eel biology under changing environmental conditions. different groups of european eel transcripts that putatively encode proteins critical for environmental stress response are found in the database. several transcripts encoding proteins putatively involved in environmental adaptation were found in the database. a total of  <dig> different heat shock proteins were identified , a class of functionally related proteins whose expression is increased when exposed to stress, many functioning as molecular chaperones with a critical role in protein binding and folding. regarding oxidative stress response,  <dig> contigs encoding at least  <dig> different forms of glutathione peroxidase were identified, key enzymes involved in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide but also associated with sh3-domain binding, endopeptidase inhibition and anti-apoptotic activity through caspase regulation. three contigs were annotated as encoding at least two superoxide dismutase proteins, a class of enzymes with a role in superoxide catalysis. finally,  <dig> contigs represented mhc  genes, which play an important role in the immune system. direct keyword search by go terms, implemented in the database, allows to efficiently retrieve the relevant information.

as a last step, the kegg  pathway approach for higher order functional annotation was implemented using the tool david. using zebrafish as reference genome, a total of  <dig>  zebrafish genes homologous to european eel transcripts were mapped to kegg pathways. three of them are significantly enriched: ribosome , oxidative phosphorylation  and proteasome  .

comparison with zebrafish and three-spine stickleback genomes
european eel transcripts were aligned with the complete zebrafish genome using blat, in order to reconstruct the exon-intron structure of european eel genes, which might be useful for primer and probes design in future experimental studies. for each transcript, the pairwise alignment with the best-matching zebrafish genome region was retrieved and analysed. in total, blat detected similarities with a genomic region for  <dig>  contigs, although a fraction of alignments included small regions and/or low percentages of sequence identity. using alignments between transcript and genomic of at least  <dig> nucleotides and 70% sequence identity as criteria,  <dig>  transcripts  were related bona fide to the corresponding orthologous region in the zebrafish genome. considering the ratio between matching region and transcript length,  <dig> % of transcripts with significant genome match aligned with zebrafish for at least 50% of the sequence length, while  <dig> % aligned with at least 75% of the sequence length. similarly, eel transcripts were aligned with the available genome of the three-spine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus. applying the same criteria used for zebrafish genome matches, only  <dig>  european eel contigs, corresponding to  <dig> % of the total, aligned with the stickleback genome. of these, 4% aligned for at least 50% of the sequence length and  <dig> % for at least 75% of the sequence length, whereas  <dig>  aligned also with zebrafish genome.

according to phylogenetic data, anguilliformes are a basal branch in the teleost evolution that diverged before the separation of other teleost lineages, including cyproniformes  and gasterosteiformes . thus, discrepancies in genome matches across species could be explained by differences in genome structure rather than by differential sequence divergence. the higher number of matches in zebrafish may be consequence of the highly duplicated nature of the zebrafish genome  <cit> . indeed, genome size is three times larger in zebrafish  than in stickleback , according to  <cit> . moreover, while the zebrafish genome is fully sequenced, the stickleback genome is under completion with only  <dig>  gb available so far .

transcriptome redundancy
transcriptome redundancy is expected in assembled contigs due to the heuristic nature of the assembly process and the settings used to avoid assembly of slightly different sequences. different kinds of redundancy can be considered. transcript-level redundancy is observed if different contigs belong to the same transcript. this may result from lack of conditions for merging read sequences for a same transcript in a unique contig, due to no sequence overlap or to sequencing errors. gene-level redundancy is observed when different contig sequences belong to the same gene or transcriptional region. this may partially be explained by the pervasive existence of alternative transcripts. recently, lu et al.  <cit>  suggested an inverse relation between genome size and alternative splicing frequency in teleost fish. while the lowest value of alternatively splicing was found in the highly duplicated zebrafish genome, the highest value was found in the compact genome of pufferfish. assuming 30% alternative splicing that is intermediate among the values found in  <cit>  and an approximate value of  <dig>  events per gene, about 42% of transcripts are expected to belong to alternatively spliced genes in the european eel. considering the fraction of annotated contigs,  <dig>  contigs are associated to  <dig>  unique descriptions,  <dig>  of which are represented by a single contig. thus 43%  of contigs might be transcripts of different genes, whereas the remaining fraction of contigs may be redundant at gene level . considering that different descriptions may correspond to different genes, the fraction of descriptions represented by at least two contigs  is very close to the assumed 30% of alternatively spliced genes. on the other hand, the number of contigs per description exceeds the expected number of transcripts per alternatively spliced gene  with an excess only partially explained by the fact that some of the largest groups of contigs are associated to quite general descriptions . thus, the description redundancy in european eel contig annotation may be largely, but not completely, explained by alternative splicing rates in fishes.

as an example, contig eu_c <dig>  is annotated as psa <dig> , as it matches different proteins of the interpro family ipr <dig> . the contig sequence corresponds to a putative full-length transcript with best match in translated nr to a putative ortholog of zebrafish , a  <dig> aa proteasome subunit, whose cds is completely included in the european eel transcriptome. the alignment of the same contig with the zebrafish genome highlights the existence of detectable sequence similarity also outside the cds, since the contig aligns with a  <dig>  nucleotides genomic region of chromosome  <dig>  with a total of  <dig>  nucleotides aligned with 87% sequence identity. looking at the contig annotation, there are two additional  contigs in the transcriptome, which are annotated as psa2: eu_c <dig> and eu_c <dig>  these sequences match partially overlapping protein hits groups with eu_c <dig>  and match the same zebrafish genome region. however, they include different combinations of sequence fragments and likely correspond to alternative transcripts. thus, these three transcripts belonging to a putative psa <dig> european eel gene are correctly included in separated contigs.

identification of putative micrornas
micrornas are small non-coding rnas playing important roles in the regulation of gene expression in biological processes including cell differentiation, organogenesis and development  <cit> . in order to identify putative novel micrornas belonging to evolutionary conserved families, the european eel transcriptome was compared with known metazoan microrna hairpin sequences. a total of  <dig> significant local alignments between contigs and hairpin sequences were identified, involving  <dig> different hairpins. for each hairpin sequence, we also considered the absolute positions of the known major and/or minor mature sequences in the hairpin, given by the mirbase database, in order to discriminate between contig/hairpin matches involving a more or less extended region of a hairpin from those overlapping a mature mirna sequence. table  <dig> reports a total of  <dig> contigs matching both hairpins and mature mirnas sequences known in different species.

contigs were selected when part of their sequence is highly similar to a known metazoan hairpin microrna precursor. for each hairpin sequence, we also considered if the regions aligned with the hairpin sequence overlap the major or the minor mature sequence position.

eeelbase: the european eel transcriptome database
a database, freely available online at http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/eeelbase/, has been implemented using mysql and django web framework. the database is filled with different layers of information regarding the european eel transcriptome sequences and analysis results. for each contig, a gene-like entry  reports different data and bioinformatic analyses results, according to the schema detailed below:

• contig information. for each contig , the fasta sequence is provided along with an informative contig description using blast2go or the best hit when the blast2go description was unavailable.

• assembly. the list of reads belonging to the contig is given, together with two fasta files including all read sequences, contig with read sequences, and multiple alignment of the contig with reads.

• gene ontology. go terms associated to transcripts using the blast2go analysis on blastx vs nr database results are given for the three ontologies, linked to the go database. blast results, both for nucleotide and protein database searches, are shown in a dedicated section in the classic blast output format, hyperlinked to external databases, and including the list of alignment descriptions and details about the pairwise alignments of the transcript with blast hits.

• reference fish genomes alignment. zebrafish and three-spine stickleback genome matches in the ucsc genome browser are provided to the user, by means of links allowing on the fly blat search against the last release of zebrafish and three-spine stickleback genomes, thus facilitating the identification and visualisation of one or more genomic regions putatively homologous to the considered transcript.

• blast results. both for nucleotide and protein database, results of similarity searches are shown in a dedicated section in the classic blast output format, including the list of alignments descriptions and details about the pairwise alignments with hits, each hyperlinked to external databases entries.

• putative mirnas. for those eel transcripts including a putative mirna sequence, a dedicated field is included in the entry, detailing its identity, linked to the corresponding mirbase database entry.

summary of eeelbase information content  is reported in the home page, which will be regularly updated with the subsequent database releases.

the database is searchable by keywords and by blast, using nucleotide or protein sequences. indeed, it implements a query system for massive data retrieval. for a given group of contigs, selected by go terms id or by keywords search on contigs and blast hits descriptions, a customizable .tsv file can be retrieved with data regarding contig id, description and sequence as well as associated go ids and terms. fasta files and ace files with reads/contigs alignments can be downloaded from the main page.

CONCLUSIONS
next generation sequencing has opened the door to genomic analysis of non-model organisms. the growing number of species for which significant genetic resources are available is sparking a new era of study in which fundamental genetic questions underlying phenotypic evolution, adaptation and speciation can be addressed with rigor. the european eel transcriptome, the first obtained by high throughput  <dig> sequencing for a critically endangered species, has been produced, annotated and made freely available through a dedicated and searchable database. with over  <dig>  contigs, 36% of which annotated by similarity to known protein or nucleotide sequences and about  <dig> % aligned to the zebrafish or three-spine stickleback genomes, and  <dig> contigs matching mirnas sequences known in different metazoan species, this new resource represents a significant advance in anguillid genomics. considering the critically endangered status of the european eel and the multiple factors potentially involved in eel decline, including anthropogenic factors such as pollution and human-introduced diseases, our results provide a rich source of data to discover and identify new genes, characterize gene expression and for the identification of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms . transcriptome sequencing is frequently used to provide greater insight into many basic biological questions. applications include the understanding of adaptation, effects of and possible adaptive evolutionary responses to pollutants and other types of environmental stress, improvement of aquaculture, and the discovery of novel genes coding for important life-history traits.

current demand for eels cannot be met by fisheries and relies on aquaculture instead  <cit> . the most promising application of genomics in the european eel is aquaculture, which currently satisfies the big market demand for eels that fisheries are no longer meeting. using a proteomic approach, key genes for growth and survival in aquaculture stocks can be identified. in this sense, our annotation revealed several genes with a potential role in growth including growth hormone , insulin-like growth factor  and transforming growth factor , primary candidates for genetic factors affecting growth. our annotation also showed proteins related to stress, which could also be important in aquaculture as the reduction of stress might lead to a higher growth and reproductive output.
