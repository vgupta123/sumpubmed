BACKGROUND
in bacteria, >  <dig> non-coding small rnas  have been described  <cit> . the first bacterial srnas were discovered in escherichia coli, either fortuitously due to their abundance or by the observation of phenotypes conferred by their overexpression. some abundant and stable srnas were found early in gel electrophoretic analysis. they include  <dig>  s rna, which is implicated in protein export; a component of rnase p, which participates in trna processing; and tmrna, which has an important role in translational quality control  <cit> . the majority of srnas was identified by systematic approaches, principally in e. coli. computational searches mainly focused on intergenic regions  and were combined with predictions of promoters and of rho-independent transcription terminators  <cit> . the qrna algorithm, which takes into account the sequence homology of igrs in closely related species as well as conserved secondary structures  <cit> , was combined with experimental methods to identify several srnas, e.g. those involved in sporulation of bacillus subtilis  <cit> .

most bacterial srnas studied have regulatory roles in gene expression, occurring in many instances at a post-transcriptional level. in one type of post-transcriptional regulation, which is usually governed by the rna chaperone hfq in gram-negative bacteria, srnas interact with specific mrna targets, thereby modifying the accessibility of the shine-dalgarno sequence to the translational machinery and often altering the stability of the mrna. for instance, in e. coli, the iron-containing superoxide dismutase sodb is regulated by iron availability via the srna ryhb, which base-pairs with sodb mrna. this interaction blocks ribosome access and favors nucleolytic degradation of the mrna  <cit> . a second type of post-transcriptionally active srnas interacts with rna-binding regulatory proteins of the rsma/csra family. rsma  and csra  can act as translational repressors; srnas having high affinity for these proteins are therefore able to relieve translational repression by sequestering them  <cit> .

in pseudomonads, few srnas have been studied. in p. fluorescens, the srnas rsmx, rsmy and rsmz were detected by their binding capacity to the regulatory protein rsma  <cit> , by their sequence similarity with already identified srnas  <cit> , or by multicopy suppression of a gaca mutation  <cit> . the gacs/gaca two-component system  activates the transcription of these three srnas. when they are present in high concentrations, they titrate the rna-binding proteins rsma and its homolog rsme, resulting in enhanced translational expression of genes involved in biocontrol of plant root diseases and in resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . biocontrol factors of strain cha <dig> are secondary metabolites  and lytic exoenzymes  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, the gac/rsm system involves two srnas, rsmy and rsmz  <cit> . as part of the quorum sensing machinery this regulatory system not only controls the expression of genes specifying exoproducts such as hcn, pyocyanin and elastase, but also upregulates the expression of the rhli gene, which codes for the enzyme synthesizing the quorum sensing signal n-butanoyl-homoserine lactone  <cit> . furthermore, a search for fur-box motifs in igrs of p. aeruginosa led to the discovery of two iron-regulated srnas, prrf <dig> and prrf <dig>  <cit> . more recently, a study using a program that combines several predictive features mentioned above revealed a total of  <dig> srnas in strain pao <dig>  <cit> .

we have begun to search for new gaca-regulated srnas in pseudomonas spp., by applying the qrna method to igrs of various pseudomonas spp., combined with a prediction of rho-independent terminators and, where appropriate, putative promoters. eight srnas were newly identified in p. aeruginosa by northern blotting experiments. by comparing srna expression in the wild-type with that in a gaca mutant, we discovered a novel gaca-controlled srna termed rgsa. we analyzed its regulation and involvement in biocontrol factor expression and oxidative stress response in p. fluorescens cha <dig>  moreover, we show that rgsa expression in p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens strictly depends on the stress sigma factor rpos.

RESULTS
prediction and screening of srnas in p. aeruginosa pao1
the majority of the bacterial srna genes found to date is located in igrs  <cit>  and the size of the srnas generally varies between  <dig> and  <dig> nt  <cit> . accordingly, we based our search for srnas in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> on the criterion that srna genes should be located in igrs that are larger than  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> igrs fulfilled this condition. we then assumed that functional srna sequences should be conserved in closely related species  <cit>  and we used blastn to search for sequences that are homologous to the  <dig> igrs of p. aeruginosa in the genomic sequences of five related pseudomonads . only those pao <dig> igrs were selected that shared more than 65% sequence identity with a genomic sequence of at least one other pseudomonad. the alignments resulting from the blast program were then subjected to qrna analysis  <cit> . in pairwise alignments of homologous sequences, this algorithm evaluates pairs of nucleotide substitutions and calculates their probabilities of having structural or codon usage conservation and discriminates sequence pairs without a sufficient number of substitutions. rnas having substitutions with a bias towards codon usage are likely to code for polypeptides whereas pairs of substitutions that maintain stem-loop structures have a higher probability to reflect secondary structure conservation of non-coding rnas. although the sequences subjected to blastn analysis consisted only of intergenic, non-coding regions according to the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> genome annotations, sequences whose coding probabilities calculated by qrna were found to be high were nevertheless retained for further analysis. by applying qrna in this way,  <dig> out of the initial  <dig> igrs from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> were retained . among these  <dig> igrs,  <dig> were found to contain exclusively trna or rrna genes and were not considered further. in the  <dig> remaining regions, the presence of rho-independent terminators was assessed using transterm  <cit>  set at a confidence cut-off of 93% .

experimental observation of srnas in p. aeruginosa pao1
igrs occurring in p. aeruginosa and at least two other pseudomonads and having recognizable promoter elements  were preferentially chosen for northern blot analysis. cultures of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> were grown in nutrient yeast broth  to exponential or stationary phase and total rna was extracted. northern blot analysis was carried out with digoxigenin -labeled probes, each covering an entire igr. among  <dig> igrs thus analyzed,  <dig> were reproducibly found to express srnas . figure  <dig> shows all transcripts revealed, except for four srnas that had been described previously:  <dig> s rna   <cit> , an rnase p component found in many bacteria   <cit> , and prrf <dig> and prrf <dig> found in p. aeruginosa   <cit> . they were considered to validate the method and not investigated further. three additional srnas  are among the  <dig> p. aeruginosa srnas described by livny et al.  <cit> . in that study, the three srnas are designated p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. in conclusion, we detected eight new srnas encoded by the remaining igrs.

g dir., direction of srna genes. when rho-independent terminators are predicted to be present, the direction of the srna is annotated . when the direction is unknown, this is indicated by a question mark

all transcripts were also detected when cells had been cultivated in the iron-limited medium ggp or in the minimal medium mme , except for  <dig> srna, which was not tested in these alternative media. six regions  produced more than one transcript ; we only indicate the most prevalent bands in this figure. multiple transcripts can be due to processed srnas, 5' leader mrna sequences or 3' mrna fragments related to flanking genes  <cit> . three other regions  each revealed a major band, together with possible degradation products. whenever the srna transcript length could be predicted with reasonable certainty , at least one of the main transcripts observed had the expected size . igr  <dig> specified a transcript that had previously been observed  <cit> ; we deduce from the sequence that it originates from an rpos-dependent promoter. the 180-nt srna encoded by igr  <dig>  which is located between the ribc and ribd genes, is a homolog of srog, a transcript resulting from the cleavage of a riboswitch element found upstream of ribb in e. coli  <cit> . the p. aeruginosa srog homolog was slightly longer than the srog transcript in e. coli   <cit> . the  <dig> srna of p. aeruginosa may be involved in regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis, by analogy with the homologous element in e. coli  <cit> . in four cases , the coordinates of the srna genes can be deduced either from recognizable promoter and terminator elements or by sequence comparison with an e. coli rna .

gaca- and rpos-regulated expression of the  <dig> srna in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. fluorescens cha0
the expression of the  <dig> srnas shown in figure  <dig> was tested in the p. aeruginosa gaca mutant pao <dig> by northern blotting. the  <dig> srna was the only transcript that showed a significantly decreased expression in the gaca mutant, compared with that in the wild-type pao <dig> . this 120-nt transcript was further characterized. it was virtually absent from strain pao <dig> during the exponential phase, but was produced abundantly in the stationary phase. in the gaca mutant, the expression of the  <dig> srna was about two-fold lower than in the wild-type , suggesting positive regulation by gaca. moreover, in a mutant lacking the stress/stationary phase sigma factor rpos, pao1-rpos  <cit> , no expression of this rna was detected . we therefore named this srna rgsa .

the rgsa srna was also observed in p. fluorescens cha <dig> , a strain closely related to p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  whose genome has been sequenced. there is 99% identity between the two p. fluorescens strains for the igr  <dig> . in strain cha <dig>  the band corresponding to this srna was faint in the wild-type cha <dig>  the gaca mutant cha <dig> and the rpos mutant cha <dig> during the exponential phase. in the stationary phase, the transcript was observed clearly in the wild-type, whereas the expression was strongly reduced in the gaca mutant and in the rpos mutant , suggesting that again both gaca and rpos contribute to the regulation of rgsa rna.

as a control, we included the rsmz srna of strain cha <dig> in this northern blot analysis. confirming earlier results  <cit> , we see that rsmz expression depends on positive control by gaca, but is independent of rpos .

location of the rgsa gene in pseudomonads
the rgsa gene is strongly conserved in seven related pseudomonads . the promoter, the rho-independent terminator and a putative upstream regulating sequence  show extensive sequence similarities. the transcription start site was tentatively deduced from the consensus - <dig> element  of rpos-dependent promoters  <cit> . the presence of this rpos promoter element is in agreement with our finding that rgsa srna was absent from an rpos mutant of p. aeruginosa and that a reduced amount of this srna was present in an rpos mutant of p. fluorescens. in a database search, we did not find any sequence that is highly similar to the entire conserved urs sequence, suggesting that it might be a binding site for a specialized rather than for a global regulator. in particular, the urs motif is not related to the palindromic upstream activating sequence which is located upstream of the rsmx, rsmy and rsmz genes and which is a potential gaca binding site  <cit> . we therefore suspect that the gaca effect on rgsa expression is likely to be indirect. the predicted size of rgsa  agrees well with the length of the  <dig> transcript observed in the initial northern blots .

the genomic context of the rgsa gene in p. fluorescens pf- <dig> and cha <dig> is shown in figure 3b. the flanking orf pfl_ <dig> , which is located  <dig> bp upstream, is conserved only in p. putida kt <dig>  the downstream, divergently transcribed orf pfl_ <dig>  is conserved in all pseudomonas strains sequenced to date. in e. coli, the tatd product exhibits mg-dependent dnase activity, but is not required for protein transport by the tat pathway, contrary to what was originally expected  <cit> .

regulation of rgsa gene expression in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. fluorescens cha0
to monitor the rgsa regulation by gaca during growth, we constructed rgsapao1-lacz and rgsacha0-lacz transcriptional fusions in plasmids pme <dig> and pme <dig>  respectively. the primers used for these constructions  carry a bamhi site, which enabled us to place the lacz gene under the control of the respective rgsa promoter. at low cell population densities, the wild-type strains pao <dig> and cha <dig> as well as the gaca mutants pao <dig> and cha <dig> exhibited similar basal levels of lacz expression from the rgsa-lacz constructs . at high cell population densities, the gaca mutants showed an approximately two-fold reduction of β-galactosidase activity, compared with the activity in the wild-type strain. this finding is consistent with the northern blot results . the rgsacha0-lacz fusion carried by pme <dig> was also assayed in the rpos mutant cha815; at od <dig> ≈  <dig> , this fusion showed a 40% decrease of lacz expression, compared with that in the wild-type cha <dig> . in conclusion, transcription of the rgsa gene is probably activated indirectly by gaca and directly by rpos, which is assumed to bind to the - <dig> promoter element , both in p. aeruginosa and in p. fluorescens.

role of rgsa srna in the gac/rsm regulatory cascade of p. fluorescens cha0
a single, typical rsma-binding motif  was found in an unpaired region of the rgsa srna of strain cha <dig> . the gaca-controlled srnas rsmx, rsmy and rsmz and their functional homologs each contain several gga and extended angga motifs  <cit> . in the case of rsmy, these motifs have been shown to be essential for sequestration of rsma and its homolog rsme in p. fluorescens  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether the rgsa srna might also have a titrating role, by testing whether rgsa overexpression would enhance the expression of a translational hcna'-'lacz fusion in p. fluorescens cha <dig>  expression of hcna, the first gene of the hcn operon involved in hcn biosynthesis, is tightly controlled by the gac/rsm cascade in strain cha <dig>  in an rsmx rsmy rsmz triple mutant, artificial overexpression of rsmx rescues hcna'-'lacz expression  <cit> . we measured the expression of a chromosomal hcna'-'lacz fusion in the wild-type background and in the rsmxyz triple mutant where the activity was almost totally lost . when rgsacha <dig> was overexpressed in the wild-type strain , no significant difference was observed, compared with the native context . similarly, the rgsacha <dig> overexpressing plasmid pme <dig> was unable to elevate hcna'-'lacz expression in the rsmxyz triple mutant , which was indistinguishable from the strain carrying the vector alone  . in a control experiment, we verified rgsacha <dig> overexpression by plasmid pme <dig>  total rna was extracted from strains carrying either pme <dig> or the vector pme <dig> and the amount of rgsa srna expressed in the cells was evaluated by northern blotting. overexpression of rgsa srna was detectable in the wild-type strain cha <dig> and even more clearly in the rpos mutant cha <dig> . in conclusion, the single rsma-binding motif of rgsa was unable to derepress hcna expression in p. fluorescens, confirming earlier evidence that multiple gga motifs are required in srnas for effective sequestration of rsma-like proteins  <cit> .

the gac/rsm cascade modulates the response of p. fluorescens to stress imposed by hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . we constructed an rgsa deletion mutant of strain cha <dig> and tested its survival after a 30-min exposure to  <dig> mm h2o <dig> in nyb with shaking. this experiment was carried out three times with triplicate cultures. only  <dig> ± 16% of the mutant cells survived, compared with  <dig> ± 12% surviving wild type cells.  thus, survival was significantly  higher in the wild type than in the mutant. overexpression of rgsa afforded no significant effect. these results suggest that rgsa may contribute to oxidative stress response.

discussion
the screening procedure adopted in our study enabled us to find evidence for  <dig> srnas in p. aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp. the identification of four of these srnas can be considered as a validation of the method, as they are either widespread in bacteria  or have been previously described in p. aeruginosa   <cit> . three additional srnas  confirm the existence of molecules that were previously identified by livny et al.  <cit> , and the observed lengths of these srnas are similar in both studies. although our computational approaches are similar to those used by livny et al.  <cit> , we obtained a different output. on the one hand, we found evidence for eight new srnas. it is likely that by applying a 93% confidence threshold in the prediction of rho-independent terminators with transterm, we expanded the spectrum of intergenic regions considered to carry srna genes, whereas livny et al.  <cit>  had used a 96% threshold. on the other hand,  <dig> srnas detected by livny et al.  <cit>  were not identified in this study, either because the igrs that produce them were discarded by our configuration of the qrna program  or because we did not subject all  <dig> candidate igrs to northern blot analysis . by introducing two additional genomes into the analysis, i.e., those of p. fluorescens pf0- <dig> and p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  and by considering only the most widely conserved candidates we also demanded a higher level of conservation than did livny et al.  <cit> .

rsmy and rsmz, the rsma-binding srnas previously described in p. aeruginosa  <cit> , were not revealed in our present study. the reasons for this may be that the rsmz srnas of strains pao <dig> and cha <dig> have only 63% sequence identity , just below the 65% cut-off used. although the rsmy srnas of strains pao <dig> and cha <dig> share 73% overall sequence identity in a needle alignment, the conserved segments of the rsmy srnas obtained with the blastn searches were short and shared an elevated sequence identity. in such cases the qrna program, which needs sufficient substitutions that preserve secondary structures or codon bias, fails to identify and categorize the rnas, explaining the absence of rsmy from our study.

in both p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. fluorescens cha <dig> the gac/rsm cascade regulates the expression of exoproducts such as hcn. in these organisms, a double rsmy rsmz and triple rsmx rsmy rsmz mutant, respectively, have the same exoproduct phenotype as gaca mutants  <cit> . however, in strain cha <dig>  gaca has an additional function as a regulator of rpos expression and, consequently, of the response to oxidative stress  <cit> . this raised the question of whether there might be further gaca-controlled srnas, which might be involved in stress response. this idea motivated us to test the srnas listed in table  <dig> for regulation by gaca. in both strains pao <dig> and cha <dig>  the rgsa  srna was found to have reduced expression in gaca mutants, by comparison with the wild-type strains . moreover, rpos was needed for rgsa induction in both strains during stationary phase . we confirmed this regulation in both p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens by measuring the expression of rgsa-lacz fusion constructs . we also found that the overexpressed rgsa srna was unable to relieve translational repression of the hcna gene in p. fluorescens , which is consistent with the fact that this srna has only a single gga motif. previously, it was shown that an rsmy mutant having a single gga motif has lost the ability to bind the rsma and rsme proteins  <cit> .

in response to h2o <dig> stress, a p. fluorescens mutant deleted for the rgsa gene showed a reduced ability to survive, compared with the wild type. the mechanism by which this protective effect of rgsa occurs remains to be discovered.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have found evidence for eight new srnas in p. aeruginosa. this brings the total of detected srnas to almost  <dig> in this organism. for the vast majority of them, the physiological roles are unknown. we discovered that the rgsa srna, which was termed p <dig> by livny et al.  <cit> , is transcribed from an rpos-dependent promoter under positive, probably indirect control of gaca in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> as well as in p. fluorescens cha <dig>  in the latter organism, the rgsa srna appears to be unable to sequester the rsma and rsme proteins and is unlikely to have a role in the regulation of exoproduct formation, but helps protect the bacterium from h2o <dig>
