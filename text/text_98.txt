BACKGROUND
the genus corynebacterium belongs to the taxonomic class actinobacteria and represents a diverse group of gram-positive bacteria with a dna of high g + c content, whose members were recognized in a large variety of habitats  <cit> . the most prominent species of the genus corynebacterium is the human pathogen corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is the etiological agent of the acute, communicable disease diphtheria  <cit> . with the exception of c. diphtheriae, the pathogenicity of other corynebacterial species from clinical sources has been underestimated for a long time, as they were often regarded as skin contaminants in human infections  <cit> . the improved taxonomic recognition of corynebacteria in clinical specimens and the increasing number of case reports associating non-diphtherial species with infections in humans and also in animals has changed this view during the last decade  <cit> . in particular, the common skin colonizers corynebacterium urealyticum and corynebacterium jeikeium, which both belong to a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> , were frequently associated with infections in immunocompromised patients. c. urealyticum is primarily recovered from hospitalized elderly individuals and can cause urinary tract infections  <cit> , whereas c. jeikeium is associated with a variety of nosocomial infections, for instance with endocarditis after cardiac surgery and with bacteremia in hematological patients  <cit> . the majority of clinical isolates assigned to these species displayed a remarkable multi-drug resistance in such a way that only glycopeptide antibiotics remain universally active against these pathogens  <cit> . the development of multi-drug resistance in corynebacteria is probably enhanced by the selective pressure occurring in the hospital setting and has tremendous consequences for the successful treatment of human infections, especially in elderly individuals and in immunocompromised patients  <cit> .

in  <dig>  a new multi-drug resistant corynebacterium was isolated from human infections in japan and named corynebacterium resistens  <cit> . five strains of this bacterium were recovered from blood samples, bronchial aspirates, and abscess specimens and characterized by measuring their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. four strains were obtained from inpatients and revealed high levels of resistance to macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and β-lactams, whereas the fifth isolate was recovered from an outpatient and shown to be susceptible to imipenem and minocycline. the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin remained universally active against the five isolates. although the administration of vancomycin is generally regarded as the first choice to eradicate multi-drug resistant corynebacteria, the use of this glycopeptide antibiotic is restricted to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  in japan. minocycline, a second generation tetracycline  <cit> , was administered instead, but this antimicrobial therapy failed and probably contributed to the subsequent death of a patient from sepsis  <cit> .

experimental data from a polyphasic taxonomic approach revealed that the five clinical isolates were genetically identical and repesent a new subline within the genus corynebacterium, with the multi-drug resistant species c. urealyticum and c. jeikeium as phylogenetic neighbors  <cit> . the type strain of this new corynebacterial species is c. resistens dsm  <dig>  that was isolated from a positive blood culture of samples taken from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia  <cit> . in this study, we present the complete genome sequence and bioinformatic analysis of c. resistens dsm  <dig> providing detailed insights into the lipophilic lifestyle and the virulence factors of this strain. during the sequencing project we recognized that c. resistens dsm  <dig> harbors a plasmid that we named pja <dig>  the dna sequences of the chromosome and pja <dig> revealed the molecular mechanisms leading to the extensive antibiotic resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  we detected the tet gene to cause resistance to minocycline and verified its functioning in corynebacteria by expressing the resistance determinant in the susceptible host strain corynebacterium glutamicum atcc  <dig> 

RESULTS
pyrosequencing and annotation of the c. resistens dsm  <dig> genome
the genomic sequence of c. resistens dsm  <dig> was determined by a whole-genome shotgun approach with pyrosequencing technology. a quarter of a single run with the genome sequencer flx system and titanium chemistry yielded  <dig>  reads with a total number of  <dig> , <dig> bases that were assembled into  <dig> large  contigs and  <dig> small contigs. bioinformatic analysis of the sequence assembly indicated that  <dig> contigs belong to a plasmid that was named pja <dig>  the remaining gaps in the chromosome and in plasmid pja <dig> were closed by pcr strategies that were supported by the consed program  <cit> . the final assemblies of the dna sequences yielded a circular chromosome with a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp  and the  <dig> -bp sequence of plasmid pja <dig> . gene finding and annotation of the c. resistens dsm  <dig> genome were performed with the gendb software system  <cit>  and resulted in the detection and characterization of  <dig>  protein-coding regions on the chromosome. furthermore, three rrn operons were detected with the rnammer tool  <cit> , and  <dig> trna genes were predicted by the trnascan-se program  <cit> . relevant features deduced from the genome sequence of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are summarized in table  <dig>  plasmid pja <dig> consists of  <dig> protein-coding regions, of which nine were classified as pseudogenes. all pseudogenes of pja <dig> are remnants of protein-coding regions truncated by the transpositional integration of insertion sequences.

general architecture of the c. resistens dsm  <dig> chromosome
the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> revealed the typical features of a corynebacterial genome sequence. a plot of the calculated g/c skew  indicated a bi-directional replication mechanism of the c. resistens chromosome . according to the presence and distribution of conserved dnaa boxes, the origin of replication  is located downstream of the dnaa coding region  <cit> . the biased distribution of architecture imparting sequences  on the leading and lagging strands of the chromosome indicated the presence of a dif region involved in replication termination  <cit>  at  <dig>  kb on the chromosomal map, dividing the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> into two replichores of nearly similar sizes . a comparative analysis by reciprocal best matches with blastp  <cit>  revealed a highly conserved order of orthologous genes between the chromosomes of c. resistens dsm  <dig> and c. jeikeium k <dig> . since corynebacteria lack the recbcd recombination pathway  <cit> , genetic rearrangements are generally rare in the respective genomes, although a moderate reorganization of the chromosomal architecture has been detected in species of the cluster  <dig> subline of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> . the chromosomal synteny between c. resistens dsm  <dig> and c. jeikeium k <dig> is interrupted due to a translocation of a 154-kb dna region and the inversion of two distinct genomic segments in c. resistens . as these inversions are part of the right replichore and as intra-replichore inversions are relatively rare  <cit> , we assume that the current chromosomal architecture of c. resistens dsm  <dig> resulted from a flip-flop of two consecutive inversions. flip-flop means in this genomic context that the 125-kb central region of an initially inverted 270-kb dna segment was probably inverted again to maintain the architectural bias in this part of the c. resistens chromosome .

we therefore examined the gene-strand bias in the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  taking into account that gene essentiality is a proposed driving force for the genetic organization in bacterial genomes  <cit> . in total,  <dig> % of the protein-coding regions of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are located on the leading strands of the chromosome, revealing a moderate gene-strand bias in this species. a comparative content analysis of predicted protein-coding regions from c. resistens dsm  <dig> with candidate essential genes detected in the genome of c. glutamicum r by high-density transposon mutagenesis  <cit>  revealed  <dig> candidate essential genes from c. glutamicum r having orthologs in the chromosome of c. resistens. the majority of these genes  are located on the leading strands of the c. resistens chromosome, with  <dig> % of all candidate essential genes being located on the left replichore, clearly indicating the prominent role of gene essentiality in bacterial gene-strand bias  <cit> . in the inverted genomic segment of the c. resistens chromosome,  <dig> candidate essential genes are located on the leading strand, whereas  <dig> candidate essential genes were detected on the lagging strand. this equal distribution of candidate essential genes on the leading and lagging strands might explain why an intra-replichore inversion has been established in the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  it suggests furthermore that the orientation of the respective genes has no remarkable impact on the fitness of c. resistens dsm  <dig> 

additional breakpoints of synteny between the chromosomes of c. resistens dsm  <dig> and c. jeikeium k <dig> are caused by the presence of genes related to two prophages, named ϕcres i and ϕcres ii . the genomic segment of c. resistens dsm  <dig> assigned to ϕcres i has a size of about  <dig>  kb and comprises  <dig> genes, whereas the ϕcres ii region has a size of about  <dig>  kb and comprises  <dig> genes, including a transposase gene of an integrated insertion sequence . both putative prophage genomes share not only a very similar set of protein-coding regions, but also a highly similar order of these genes, suggesting that the respective phages are genetically related . moreover, a dna region with  <dig> clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  was detected in the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> with the crisprfinder tool  <cit> . the crispr locus comprises dna repeats with a length of  <dig> bp, which are separated by variable 33-bp spacer sequences. the adjacent genomic region in the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> comprises seven crispr-associated genes, named casa-casg. the combination of highly similar crisprs and associated cas genes was detected previously in c. jeikeium k <dig>  <cit> , c. urealyticum dsm  <dig>  <cit> , and nocardia farcinica ifm  <dig>  <cit>  and can probably provide acquired resistance to bacteriophages  <cit> .

a comparative content analysis of the predicted proteome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> with the complete set of proteins encoded in the genomes of c. jeikeium k <dig>  <cit> , c. urealyticum dsm  <dig>  <cit> , and corynebacterium kroppenstedtii dsm  <dig>  <cit>  revealed that the four species belonging to the corynebacterial cluster  <dig> share  <dig> orthologous proteins, representing  <dig> % of the predicted proteins from c. resistens dsm  <dig> . according to this comparative data, c. resistens dsm  <dig> contains  <dig> species-specific genes that probably contribute to the characteristic phenotypic features of this bacterium. in the following sections, we analyze the gene repertoire of c. resistens dsm  <dig> in more detail and deduce relevant features regarding the lipophilic lifestyle and the functions involved in virulence and multi-drug resistance of this new human pathogen.

general metabolic features and lipophilic lifestyle of c. resistens dsm 45100
a bioinformatic reconstruction of the central carbon metabolism of c. resistens dsm  <dig> revealed the absence of genes coding for the components of phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems  . the absence of the respective genes in c. resistens dsm  <dig> was supported by tblastn searches with reference proteins from other corynebacteria or actinobacteria. ptss play a major role in uptake and phosphorylation of numerous carbohydrates, as well as in monitoring the bacterial environment to choose alternative carbon sources for growth  <cit> . only the sugabcd gene cluster encoding a putative sugar transport system of the abc superfamily was detected in the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> . moreover, the glk gene encoding glucokinase  and the rbsk gene coding for ribokinase  are present in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  allowing the conversion of "free" sugars into phosphorylated central pathway intermediates. in accordance with this data, the taxonomic description of c. resistens indicated that glucose and ribose are catabolized by this species  <cit> . the rbsk gene is also part of a utilization pathway for the nucleoside uridine  <cit>  that is imported into c. resistens by the major facilitator superfamily transporter urit and converted to ribose and uracil by an inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase  encoded by the urih gene . further metabolic analysis of the genome sequence revealed the presence of a complete set of genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. likewise, the tricarboxylic acid cycle of c. resistens dsm  <dig> and the glyoxylate bypass, comprising the genes acea and aceb, are complete . this is remarkable as the succd genes encoding subunits of succinyl-coa synthetase  are lacking in other sequenced genomes of cluster  <dig> corynebacteria  <cit> . on the other hand, enzymes catalyzing typical anaplerotic reactions in corynebacterial metabolism are not encoded in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  and pyruvate carboxylase . this observation suggests that c. resistens dsm  <dig> is dependent on substrates for growth that are associated with the complete gluconeogenesis pathway.

the most likely substrates for growth of c. resistens are external fatty acids. c. resistens is often assigned to the group of "lipophilic" corynebacteria, whose growth is markedly enhanced by the addition of lipids to the culture medium  <cit> . this characteristic phenotype per se is a fatty acid auxotrophy that obviously originates from the lack of a fatty acid synthase gene , which is generally responsible for the biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit> . to satisfy the essential nutritional requirement for fatty acids as carbon and energy sources, a complete β-oxidation pathway is encoded in the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> . ten fadd genes encoding acyl-coa synthetases were identified in the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  including the fadd <dig> gene that is involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the fadd <dig> coding region represents a pseudogene as it is disrupted by an insertion sequence. fatty acyl-coa synthetases are generally involved in activating free fatty acids to form acyl-coa of various chain lengths concomitant with the transport into the bacterial cell  <cit>  and are also required for the utilization of endogeneous fatty acids released from membrane lipids  <cit> . the presence of a large number of orthologs and the amino acid sequence diversity of the fatty acyl-coa synthetases of c. resistens dsm  <dig> might indicate different substrate specificities of these enzymes. other enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are encoded by seven paralogs of fade , the bifunctional fadb <dig> gene , the monofunctional fadb <dig> gene , five paralogs of echa , and three paralogs of fada . the predicted amino acid sequences of the paralogous proteins vary substantially in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  again suggesting diverse substrate specificities of the respective enzymes. moreover, the acx gene of c. resistens dsm  <dig> encodes acyl-coa oxidase , which catalyzes the desaturation of fatty acyl-coa thioesters and donates electrons directly to molecular oxygen, thereby producing h2o <dig>  <cit> . the subsequent detoxification of the resulting h2o <dig> is catalyzed by catalase  encoded by the kata gene of c. resistens dsm  <dig> 

the degradation of modified fatty acyl-coa esters requires the recruitment of auxiliary enzymes to link their utilization to the main β-oxidation pathway  <cit> . the fadh gene for instance encodes  <dig> -dienoyl-coa reductase , which is required for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, whose double bond extends from an even-numbered carbon atom. moreover, the genes prpc and prpd are involved in the metabolism of propionyl-coa via the 2-methylcitrate cycle  <cit> . propionyl-coa can result from β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids and is converted to 2-methylisocitrate by the consecutive reactions of 2-methylcitrate synthase  encoded by the prpc gene, and 2-methylcitrate dehydratase  encoced by prpd. the last step of this cycle, the cleavage of 2-methylisocitrate to succinate and pyruvate, is catalyzed by 2-methylisocitrate lyase  that is not encoded in the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  despite the lack of a corresponding prpb gene to complete the 2-methylcitrate cycle, the oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids by c. resistens dsm  <dig> seems possible when considering that isocitrate lyase  might also function as 2-methylisocitrate lyase, as it was demonstrated in mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . c. resistens dsm  <dig> can also channel propionate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle via the enzymatic reactions encoded by the methylcitrate cycle genes . propionate is imported into c. resistens dsm  <dig> by a monocarboxylic acid transporter encoded by the mctc gene  <cit> .

the activation of fatty acids to acyl-coa thioesters is not only the initial step of the β-oxidation pathway, but also for the biosynthesis of corynomycolic acids  <cit> . mycolic acids are major constituents of the corynebacterial cell envelope and synthesized by the polyketide synthase pks <dig>  <cit>  and the reductase cmra  <cit> . the pks <dig> coding region of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is located in a conserved gene cluster  <cit> , including genes coding for an acyl-coa carboxylase , an acyl-coa synthetase/acyl-amp ligase , the envelope lipids regulation factor elrf , and two trehalose corynomycol transferases . a third gene coding for a corynomycolyl transferase  is located elsewhere in the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  trehalose corynomycol transferases catalyze the transfer of mycolic acids from trehalose monocorynomycolate on the cell wall arabinogalactan and on another trehalose monocorynomycolate to yield trehalose dicorynomycolate  <cit> .

another gene cluster involved in fatty acid metabolism of c. resistens dsm  <dig> includes genes coding for α and β subunits of acyl-coa carboxylase , an acyl-coa dehydrogenase , a putative enoyl-coa hydratase domain-containing protein , a citrate lyase β-subunit , an acyl-coa synthetase , and a ketoacyl-coa thiolase . the regulatory gene tetr encoding a regulator of the tetr protein family is located in front of the accd <dig> gene and might be involved in the transcriptional control of the complete gene cluster. a similar arrangement of genes is present only in the genomes of the lipophilic species c. jeikeium k <dig> and corynebacterium amycolatum sk <dig>  whereas a subset of genes  was found also in the genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv  <cit> . as most of the proteins encoded in these conserved gene clusters are linked to fatty acid catabolism, they might be involved in the activation and subsequent degradation of a hitherto unknown fatty acid substrate.

amino acid metabolism and utilization of histidine by c. resistens dsm 45100
according to the genome annotation, all currently known pathways for the biosynthesis of standard proteinogenic amino acids are present in c. resistens dsm  <dig> . the genome sequence of c. resistens dsm  <dig> contains moreover the agxt gene encoding serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase  that catalyzes the conversion of l-serine and glyoxylate to 3-hydroxypyruvate and glycine, the sdaa gene encoding l-serine dehydratase  involved in the conversion of l-serine to pyruvate and nh <dig>  and the arcb gene encoding ornithine cyclodeaminase  that converts l-ornithine to l-proline and nh <dig> . another enzymatic reaction that generates nh <dig> is carried out by histidine ammonia-lyase . this enzyme catalyzes the first step in the degradation of l-histidine and the product, urocanate, is further metabolized to glutamate and formamid  <cit> . a complete histidine utilization  pathway was identified in c. resistens dsm  <dig> and is represented by the hut gene cluster . the products of this gene cluster catalyze the four-step conversion of l-histidine to l-glutamate . the first enzymatic reaction of this pathway is catalyzed by huth, followed by the conversion of the resulting urocanate to 4-imidazolone propanoate by urocanate hydratase . formiminoglutamate is generated in the third step by imidazolonepropionase  and is finally hydrolyzed into l-glutamate and formamide by formimidoylglutamase .

a comparative analysis of hut gene regions detected in the genus corynebacterium revealed different genetic organizations of the respective clusters in ten corynebacterial species, with c. resistens dsm  <dig> representing a new order of hut genes . all hut gene clusters contain the hutr gene, which encodes a transcription regulator of the iclr protein family that is probably involved in the transcriptional control of histidine utilization in corynebacteria. it is remarkable that the majority of corynebacterial species harboring a hut gene cluster are in some way associated with the urogenital tract. corynebacterium glucuronolyticum, corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, and corynebacterium pseudogenitalium were isolated from the urogenital tract of males and females  <cit> , whereas corynebacterium lipophiloflavum was isolated from bacterial vaginosis  <cit> . black-pigmented corynebacterium aurimucosum isolates derive from vaginal swabs and probably cause spontaneous abortion  <cit> . indeed, variable amounts of l-histidine are present in the human vaginal fluid  <cit>  and might be used by these bacteria as a combined nitrogen and carbon source for growth. c. resistens dsm  <dig> might also use l-histidine as a carbon and/or nitrogen source, thus compensating for the restricted availability of carbohydrates due to the strict lipophilic lifestyle. the natural habitat of c. resistens is currently unknown, although the utilization of l-histidine by the enzymatic machinery of the hut pathway points to a colonization of the human inguinal or perineal regions, thereby living in close proximity to the human genital tract. this hypothesis is consistent with previous microbiological studies that recovered lipophilic corynebacteria predominantly from the axillary, inguinal, and perineal areas of the human body  <cit> . these sites of the human body are characterized by an elevated moisture of the skin in conjunction with a substantial formation of hydrolipid films, which are composed of triacylglycerides, free fatty acids, ceramides, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters. these compounds are appropriate carbohydrate substrates for the growth of lipophilic corynebacteria. additional experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that c. resistens is a colonizer of the inguinal and/or perineal areas of the human body is currently lacking, as no 16s rdna sequences of c. resistens were detected in the course of the human microbiome project already covering several body sites, including the human urogenital tract  <cit> .

detection of candidate virulence factors in the genome of c. resistens dsm 45100
to better understand the pathogenic potential of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the genome sequence was furthermore screened for genes encoding candidate virulence factors, which in principle should be part of the exoproteome of this species. to estimate the number of secreted proteins encoded by c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the first  <dig> amino acid residues of each predicted protein were used to search for amino-terminal signal peptides with signalp  <dig>   <cit> . in this way, a total number of  <dig> proteins were identified to be potentially secreted by c. resistens dsm  <dig>  however, it has to be considered that proteins with signal peptides might be destined for the integration into the cytoplasmic membrane and therefore contain membrane-spanning domains  <cit> . a total number of  <dig> predicted proteins with membrane-spanning domains were detected by the tmhmm tool  <cit> , and the combined feature of signal peptides and membrane-spanning domains was found in a subset of  <dig> proteins of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the remaining proteins were screened for predicted functions probably related to the virulence of c. resistens dsm  <dig> .

c. resistens dsm  <dig> encodes two cell surface protein precursors, named sura and surb, which contain carboxyterminal sorting  signals recognized by sortase transpeptidase. the housekeeping sortase of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  is most likely responsible for anchoring these lpxtg-containing proteins to the corynebacterial cell wall  <cit> . the carboxyterminal part of the surb protein contains a remarkable tandem repeat region with the consensus sequence pgtttpgtta that is present  <dig> times with only moderate variations in the amino acid sequence. additional repeat regions with the consensus sequences watvnpdgs or vvvtypdgs are present in the central region of the cell surface protein. the surb protein of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is thus structurally similar to the alpha c protein-antigen of group b streptococci containing large tandem repeating units  <cit> . variations of the number of tandem repeat regions of the alpha c protein affected the pathogenicity of group b streptococci  <cit> , and the structural variations of the bacterial cell surface conferred protective immunity against the host defense  <cit> .

another structural component of the cell surface of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is an adhesive pilus of the spaabc type . cell-surface pili are important virulence factors that enable pathogens to adhere to specific host tissues and to modulate host immune response  <cit> . the spaabc pilus of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is covalently anchored to the corynebacterial cell wall by the pilin-specific sortases srta and srtb via a transpeptidylation mechanism  <cit> . the adhesive pilus of c. resistens dsm  <dig> consists of three pilin subunits encoded by the spaabc genes. the spaa gene encodes the major pilin of the pilus shaft, whereas the spab and spac genes code for minor pilins located at the base and at the tip of the pilus, respectively. the homologous pilus structure of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> can mediate the adhesion of the pathogen to human pharyngeal epithelial cells, which is a crucial step during infection  <cit> .

further candidate virulence factors that may support the adhesion of c. resistens dsm  <dig> to host cells are encoded by the rpfi and cwlh genes . the deduced proteins revealed amino acid sequence homology to dip <dig> and dip <dig> from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  respectively. the rpfi gene encodes a resuscitation-promoting factor-interacting protein that forms complexes with lytic transglycosylases  at the septum of dividing bacteria  <cit> . c. resistens dsm  <dig> encodes two resuscitation-promoting factors, named rpfa and rpfb, which may interact with the rpfi protein. the homologous gene product dip <dig> was shown to be crucial for adhesion and colonization of host epithelial cells  <cit> . defined dip <dig> mutant cells of c. diphtheriae completely lacked the ability to adhere to host cells and to invade these  <cit> . due to the interaction of rpfi with resuscitation-promoting factors, it is probably involved in the organization of the outer surface layer of the pathogen and might thereby impair the efficiency of adhesion. the cwlh gene of c. resistens dsm  <dig> encodes a cell wall-associated hydrolase with a carboxyterminal domain similar to proteins belonging to the nlpc/p <dig> family  <cit> . the targeted disruption of the homologous dip <dig> gene in c. diphtheriae led to decreased adherence to epithelial cells; but the exact function of this protein remains unknown so far  <cit> .

among the candidate virulence factors detected in c. resistens dsm  <dig> is also a secreted cholesterol oxidase encoded by the chod gene . the deduced chod protein is a putative membrane-damaging toxin, probably causing the enzymatic oxidation of macrophage membrane cholesterol  <cit> . cholesterol oxidase is an important cytolytic factor for rhodococcus equi as its presence was accompanied by intracellular survival of this pathogen, whereas a non-virulent strain lacking this enzyme was largely eliminated from the macrophages  <cit> . likewise, a chod mutant of m. tuberculosis was attenuated in peritoneal macrophages, whereas no attenuation was observed when the same strain was complemented with an intact chod gene  <cit> . the oxidation of membrane cholesterol might lead to total disorganization of the eukaryotic cell membrane  <cit> , supporting the release of substrates for other enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism of a pathogen. another enzyme representig a candidate virulence factor of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is the secreted alkaline ceramidase encoded by the asa gene . ceramidases hydrolyze the amide bond in ceramides, which results in the release of free fatty acids and sphingosine  <cit> . sphingolipids are components of eukaryotic cell membranes, and hence they are putative targets for acquiring fatty acids by means of eukaryotic membrane damage. moreover, the release of sphingosine by alkaline ceramidases is known for instance to attenuate the activity of macrophages  <cit> .

c. resistens dsm  <dig> can also generate free fatty acids from the host tissue by secreting lipolytic enzymes . three secreted lipases of the lip superfamily containing enzymes with broad lipolytic activities are encoded in the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> by lips <dig>  lips <dig>  and lips <dig>  these enzymes may thus contribute to the generation of free fatty acids from precursor molecules such as triacylglycerol. the prototype enzymes of the lip superfamily were studied in candida albicans, where these lipases are expressed and secreted during the infection cycle of this pathogen and may contribute to the persistence and virulence of c. albicans in human tissue  <cit> . the sgnh gene of c. resistens dsm  <dig> was also classified as a candidate virulence factor . it encodes a secreted hydrolase of the sgnh superfamily, which is a group of enzymes that hydrolyze ester bonds in lipids  <cit> . sgnh enzymes have little sequence homology to other lipases and are characterized by the four invariant catalytic residues serine, glycine, asparagine, and histidine. due to a flexible active site that appears to change conformation with the presence of different substrates, sgnh esterases and lipases are hydrolytic enzymes with multifunctional properties, such as broad substrate specificities  <cit> . in summary, numerous candidate virulence factors of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are obviously linked to the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species by providing essential nutrients for bacterial growth.

the penicillin-binding proteins and the quinolone-resistance-determining region of c. resistens dsm 45100
in addition to lipophilism and virulence, multi-drug resistance is another prominent feature of the hitherto detected clinical isolates of c. resistens  <cit> . the relevance of chromosomal genes for the multi-drug resistance profile of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is apparent when considering the results of the initial antimicrobial susceptibility assays with several β-lactams, the most broadly used class of antimicrobials, and the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. all c. resistens isolates were characterized by high minimum inhibitory concentrations  of the selected antibiotics  <cit> . the resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig> to β-lactams might be associated with the presence of antibiotic-insensitive types of penicillin-binding proteins  <cit> . the chromosome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> encodes six penicillin-binding proteins  belonging to three protein families. pbp1a and pbp1b are bifunctional transglycosylases/transpeptidases of the high-molecular weight pbp 1a family, whereas the proteins pbp2a, pbp2b, and pbp2c act as transpeptidases and are members of the high-molecular weight pbp  <dig> family  <cit> . the dac protein of c. resistens dsm  <dig> represents a d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase of the low-molecular weight pbp  <dig> family  <cit> . moreover, c. resistens dsm  <dig> contains two genes, ldt <dig>  and ldt <dig> , encoding putative l,d-transpeptidases. these enzymes can act in an alternative pathway for peptidoglycan cross-linking and can thus contribute to the resistance to β-lactam antibiotics that inhibit the penicillin-binding proteins, which usually catalyze the cross-linking reaction  <cit> . in c. jeikeium k <dig>  the high-molecular weight penicillin-binding protein pbp2c and the l,d-transpeptidase ldt <dig> were shown to be two ampicillin-insensitive cross-linking enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis  <cit> .

resistance to fluoroquinolones is often caused by mutations in the so-called quinolone-resistance-determining region  of the gyrase gene gyra  <cit> . the minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluoroquinolones determined in this study revealed high-level resistances of c. resistens dsm  <dig> to danofloxacin , ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin , and norfloxacin . single amino acid substitutions in position  <dig> of the gyra protein  are generally sufficient to generate fluoroquinolone resistance in corynebacteria, but double mutations in the gyra gene leading to changes in positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the gene product are necessary for high-level resistances  <cit> . the gyra protein of c. resistens dsm  <dig> contains typical amino acid residues in the deduced qrdr that are related to high-level fluoroquinolone resistance. in particluar, the amino acid sequence motif laiyg is characterized by the leu- <dig> and gly- <dig> residues, which were already associated with high-level resistances to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and norfloxacin in clinical isolates of corynebacterium macginleyi  <cit> . likewise, specific double mutations in the qrdr of the gyra genes from corynebacterium striatum and corynebacterium amycolatum resulted in amino acid changes in positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the gyra proteins  and in high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance  <cit> . moreover, single mutations in the gyra gene of escherichia coli leading to changes of the deduced qrdr sequence savyd to either lavyd or savyg were associated with resistances to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin  <cit> . it is thus very likely that specific mutations in the qrdr of the gyra gene of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are responsible for high-level resistances to fluoroquinolones. other antibiotic resistance phenotypes of c. resistens dsm  <dig> are apparently associated with the presence of plasmid pja <dig> that is analyzed in more detail in the following section.

the annotation of the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pja <dig> from c. resistens dsm  <dig> revealed a modular genetic structure of this replicon . the backbone of the plasmid is apparently loaded with several mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes, including a new class  <dig> integron. the insertion sequences and transposons of pja <dig> form the boundaries of five distinct dna segments, each most probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer . the dna segments of pja <dig> were assigned as follows:  replication region and plasmid backbone with similarity to the multi-drug resistance plasmid ptp <dig> from the opportunistic human pathogen c. striatum m82b;  macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  resistance region with similarity to png <dig> from the human pathogen c. diphtheriae s601;  tetracycline resistance region with similarity to plr <dig> from lactobacillus reuteri atcc  <dig>  which encodes the ribosomal protection protein tet and is reported here for the first time to occur in corynebacteria;  chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside resistance region with similarity to the tn <dig> family transposon tn5717a from the human pathogen c. urealyticum dsm 7109;  class  <dig> integron that is specified by the presence of the rare aaca1:gcug gene pair and the aada1a gene cassette.

the small plasmid backbone of pja <dig>  is characterized by the presence of the repw gene encoding the replication initiator protein repw, whose amino acid sequence contains the characteristic signature motif gvpygkypr of incw plasmids  <cit>  and is almost identical to the repa protein of ptp <dig> from c. striatum m82b  <cit> . plasmid pja <dig> is thus a new member of the small incw family of corynebacterial plasmids that probably uses the theta-type mechanism for replication  <cit> . the incw family of corynebacterial plasmids includes moreover the bacteriocin-producing plasmid pkw <dig> from c. jeikeium k <dig>  <cit> , the cryptic plasmid pcry <dig> from c. glutamicum lp- <dig> obtained from a pig-manure deodorizing plant  <cit>  and the low-copy-number plasmid plew279b from corynebacterium sp. l2-79- <dig> isolated from poultry litter  <cit> . characteristic 22-bp iterons, previously detected also on plasmid ptp <dig>  <cit> , are present downstream of the repw coding region on pja <dig>  occurring seven times. such multiple sites of directly repeated sequences were identified in the origin regions of several plasmids. they are essential dna-binding sites of the plasmid-specific replication initiator protein and have additional replication and copy number control properties  <cit> . as the remaining genes of pja <dig> are not related to typical plasmid replication and maintenance functions, it is most likely that the repw gene region and the replication initiator protein repw are solely responsible for the stable inheritance of pja <dig> in c. resistens dsm  <dig> 

dna modules of plasmid pja <dig> containing antibiotic resistance regions
module ii of plasmid pja <dig> includes the erm gene encoding a 23s rrna adenine n-6-methyltransferase  <cit> . the erm gene is preceded by is <dig> and a short leader peptide gene that might be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of erm expression by erythromycin-inducible translational attenuation  <cit> . an almost identical dna region is present on plasmid png <dig> from the erythromycin-resistant human pathogen c. diphtheriae s <dig>  <cit>  that was isolated during an outbreak of diphtheria in seattle  <cit> . previous antimicrobial susceptibility assays demonstrated that the erm gene provides high resistance levels to clinically relevant macrolides and lincosamides, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, josamycin, midecamycin, roxithromycin, spiramycin, tylosin, clindamycin, and lincomycin, and to the streptogramin b antibiotics quinupristin and pristinamycin ia  <cit> . this tremendous cross-resistance profile of erm can be understood when considering the common binding site of mls antibiotics in the bacterial ribosome that is determined by the a <dig> residue  in the large ribosomal subunit rna  <cit> .

module iv of plasmid pja <dig> comprises the complex structure of transposon tn5717c that is highly similar to transposon tn5717a from the chromosome of c. urealyticum dsm  <dig> . tn5717c is thus an interlacing of the chlorampenicol resistance transposon tn <dig>  the streptomycin resistance transposon tn <dig>  and the aminoglycoside resistance transposon tn <dig>  and seems to have its seed in tn <dig> detected on pxz <dig> from c. glutamicum  <dig>  <cit>  and in the chromosome of c. urealyticum dsm  <dig>  <cit> . transposon tn <dig> is an unusual mobile genetic element in corynebacteria that consists of a transposase gene and the cmx gene coding for a chlorampenicol efflux protein of the major facilitator superfamily  <cit> . transposon tn <dig> is, on the other hand, a typical mobile genetic element of the tn <dig> family and contains the stra-strb tandem pair of antibiotic resistance genes. the former gene encodes the aminoglycoside 3"-phosphotransferase aph-ib and the latter gene the aminoglycoside 6-phosphotransferase aph-id, both specifically conferring streptomycin resistance  <cit> . the association of the stra-strb genes with variants of transposon tn <dig> is also found in gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria, such as erwinia amylovora, pseudomonas syringae, and xanthomonas campestris, where the tn <dig> elements occur on large conjugative plasmids  <cit> . the composite transposon tn <dig> harbors the aminoglycoside resistance gene apha1-iab encoding a member of the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase protein family, aph-ic  <cit> . the expression of the apha1-iab gene from the r-plasmid ptp <dig> in the susceptible host c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> revealed high-level resistances to kanamycin, neomycin, lividomycin, paromomycin, and ribostamycin  <cit>  and thus the characteristic substrate profile of an aph-i enzyme  <cit> . the apha1-iab gene present on pja <dig> may therefore confer resistance to a selected set of aminoglycoside antibiotics in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  however, a mininum inhibitory concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was detected for the aminoglycoside amikacin in the initial taxonomic description of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  <cit> . this observation indicates that additional resistance determinants are present in c. resistens dsm  <dig> and confer a broader spectrum of aminoglycoside resistances.

the class  <dig> integron of plasmid pja <dig> and its gene cassettes encoding aminoglycoside resistance proteins
module v of plasmid pja <dig> comprises typical genes of class  <dig> integrons that constitute genetic systems for gene capture and gene expression and are composed of conserved 5' and 3' segments  <cit> . the 5' conserved segment contains an integrase gene inti <dig>  followed by the recombination site atti <dig>  where gene cassettes are integrated by site-specific recombination after the integrase has recognized their 59-bp element. the 3' conserved segment of class  <dig> integrons is often specified by the presence of the qaceΔ <dig>  sul <dig>  and orf <dig> genes  <cit> . the sul <dig> gene encodes dihydropteroate synthase that can confer resistance to a broad spectrum of sulfonamides. the class  <dig> integron of pja <dig> is characterized by small deletions in the 5' and 3' conserved segments and by a gene cassette array that comprises three coding regions: the rare aaca1:gcug tandem gene cassette and the aada1a gene cassette . the aminoglycoside resistance gene aada1a encodes the aminoglycoside 3"-adenyltransferase ant-ia with a specific substrate profile comprising only streptomycin and spectinomycin  <cit> . the aaca <dig> gene encodes the aminoglycoside 6'-acetyltransferase aac-ia that can confer resistance to kanamycin, amikacin, dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin  <cit> . it is thus likely that the aaca <dig> gene of pja <dig> mediates the observed resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig> to amikacin  <cit> .

it is remarkable that the aaca <dig> resistance gene and the gcug gene of unknown function represent a gene pair that is present in a single gene cassette and thus not separated by a 59-bp element  <cit> . the fused aaca1:gcug gene cassette is rare in class  <dig> integrons and it has been observed in corynebacteria for the first time in the present study. other class  <dig> integrons containing the aaca1:gcug gene pair were detected, for instance, on plasmid pkgb <dig> from klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit> , on pcmxr <dig> from e. coli hkym <dig>  <cit> , and on the r factor nr <dig> from e. coli w <dig>  <cit> . commonly, integrons are features of gram-negative bacteria and only few integrons have been reported from gram-positive bacteria, including two class  <dig> integrons from corynebacteria . the first corynebacterial integron was detected on plasmid pcg <dig> from c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and the second element on plasmid ptet <dig> from c. glutamicum lp- <dig>  <cit> . the integron of pcg <dig> contains the aada <dig> gene cassette, whereas the aada <dig> gene cassette was detected on ptet <dig>  both genes confer streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance and encode aminoglycoside 3"-adenyltransferases of the ant-i protein family  <cit> . accordingly, plasmid pja <dig> carries a new class  <dig> integron with two gene cassettes probably contributing to the extended spectrum of aminoglycoside resistances in c. resistens dsm  <dig> 

the tetracycline-minocycline resistance region of plasmid pja144188
module iii of plasmid pja <dig> contains the tet gene, which is preceded by the putative leader peptide gene tetlp . the deduced tet protein revealed 99% identity, with only three substitutions in the amino acid sequence, to tet encoded on plasmid plr <dig> from lactobacillus reuteri atcc  <dig>  a commercially available probiotic strain  <cit> . tet represents a ribosomal protection protein  that can promote high-level resistance to tetracyclines in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . rpps are supposed to originate from bacterial elongation factors and mediate tetracycline resistance by a complex molecular mechanism: they dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, which is occupied by the antibiotic, such that an aminoacyl-trna can bind to the a site of the ribosome and protein biosynthesis can continue. rpps can thus overcome the antimicrobial effect of typical tetracyclines, which bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein biosynthesis  <cit> . the tetracycline resistance region of pja <dig> covers a  <dig> -bp dna sequence that is almost identical to tet gene regions in streptococcus suis gz <dig>  <cit> , arcanobacterium pyogenes bbr <dig>  <cit> , and to tet on plasmid plr <dig> from l. reuteri atcc  <dig>  <cit>  . this dna segment obviously represents a conserved tet core region in these gram-positive species, whereas the flanking sequences of tet genes are highly diverse in these species and in other bacteria  <cit> . the boundaries of the tetracycline resistance region on pja <dig> are clearly defined by the presence of two remnants of insertion sequences . the truncated iscx <dig> element is known from the c. diphtheriae s <dig> plasmid png <dig> and located downstream of the tet gene, whereas a 47-bp stretch of dna with identity to the 5' end of is <dig> is present upstream of the tetlp gene.

to elucidate the capability of the tet gene product to mediate resistance to tetracyclines, including minocycline, the tet gene region was amplified by pcr and the resulting dna fragment was cloned in e. coli dh5αmcr into the shuttle vector pec-k18mob <dig>  the recombinant plasmid, designated pkm <dig>  was subsequently transferred into the antibiotic-susceptible host strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  resulting in c. glutamicum km <dig>  the role of the cloned tet gene in tetracycline resistance was examined in c. glutamicum km <dig> by measuring the mics of tetracycline and oxytetracycline , doxycycline and minocycline , and the atypical tetracycline analog anhydrotetracycline. additional antimicrobial susceptibility assays served as controls and were performed with c. resistens dsm  <dig> and c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> carrying the empty cloning vector pec-k18mob <dig>  these assays revealed that c. glutamicum km <dig> gained a remarkable resistance to first and second generation tetracyclines in comparison with the control strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  displaying mics from  <dig> μg ml- <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> . slightly higher mics were measured in c. resistens dsm  <dig> . on the other hand, the tested corynebacterial strains revealed the same mic in the assay with anhydrotetracycline, indicating that the ribosomal protection protein tet may not confer resistance to this atypical tetracycline analog. this result of the antimicrobial susceptibility assay is obvious as the primary target of anhydrotetracycline is not the bacterial ribosome and the process of translation. the antimicrobial activity of anhydrotetracycline is exerted instead by disrupting bacterial membranes  <cit> . in conclusion, the tet gene of pja <dig> is a very likely candidate to confer minocycline resistance in c. resistens dsm  <dig> and might be responsible for the failure of minocycline therapy in patients with c. resistens bacteremia.

a c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> carrying the empty cloning vector pec-k18mob2

to assess the effect of a subinhibitory concentration of tetracycline  on the transcription of tet in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the transcript levels of the tet mrna were determined in induced and non-induced cultures by real-time reverse transcription -pcr. for this purpose, total rna samples were purified from c. resistens dsm  <dig> cultures exposed to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> tetracycline for  <dig> h  and control cultures grown in the absence of tetracycline . indeed, the transcript level of tet was 52-fold higher in the c. resistens dsm  <dig> culture that has been exposed to tetracycline for  <dig> h, when compared to the control culture. this data indicated that the expression of the tet gene on pja <dig> is regulated at the level of transcription and inducible by tetracycline in c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the respective molecular mechanism is currently unknown, and the role of the putative leader peptide gene in this process, if any, remains to be elucidated. the ribosomal protection gene tet from staphylococcus aureus mrsa <dig> is also inducible by tetracycline at the level of transcription  <cit> . expression studies revealed a greatly increased amount of tet-specific mrna when the s. aureus cells were first treated with a subinhibitory amount of tetracycline. the tet gene was previously also observed by southern techniques in c. striatum strains from clinical specimens  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe the complete genome sequence and annotation of the multi-drug resistant clinical isolate c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the sequence analysis revealed comprehensive insights into the metabolic features, virulence functions, and mechanisms for antibiotic resistance of this human pathogen. the integration of these data provides for the first time a detailed view on the deduced lifestyle of c. resistens . the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species is obviously caused by the absence of genes for fatty acid synthesis, sugar uptake, and anaplerotic functions. therefore, gene loss is the dominant evolutionary mechanism in shaping the metabolic features of c. resistens, which are most probably related to the natural habitat. c. resistens might colonize of the inguinal or perineal regions of the human body, as these sites of the skin provide elevated amounts of fatty acid substrates for growth by natural secretions that contribute to the formation of hydrolipid films. moreover, the utilization of l-histidine as a nitrogen or carbon source by enzymes encoded by the hut genes suggests that c. resistens lives in close proximity to the human genital tract, since the presence of the hut pathway is predominantly associated with corynebacteria causing urogenital tract infections. the strict lipophilic lifestyle of c. resistens is also linked with enzymatic functions of several predicted virulence factors, which probably ensure the availability of external fatty acids for growth by causing damage to membranes of host cells. accordingly, the predicted repertoire of candidate virulence factors might explain the low pathogenic potential of c. resistens.

the extensive multi-drug resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig> is apparently caused by distinct features of chromosomal genes and the presence of plasmid pja <dig>  the sequence annotation of pja <dig> provided detailed insights into the gene composition and the modular genetic organization of this plasmid, thereby revealing that horizontal gene transfer represents a key factor in the development of multi-drug resistance in c. resistens. a similar set of antibiotic resistance genes is present in other multi-drug resistant corynebacteria, such as c. striatum, c. urealyticum, and c. jeikeium. this collection includes the erm and cmx genes, as well as apha1-iab and the stra-strb tandem gene pair  <cit> . the tet gene of pja <dig> encodes a ribosomal protection protein that confers resistance to first and second generation tetracyclines, including the clinically relevant tetracycline derivative minocycline. the presence of the tet gene on pja <dig> has tremendous impact on the treatment of human infections associated with c. resistens, as the cross-resistance profile of the tet protein can contribute to the failure of minocycline therapies in  patients.
