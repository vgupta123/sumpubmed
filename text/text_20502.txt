BACKGROUND
so far,  <dig> congenital defects have been identified in cattle,  <dig> of them being inherited in an autosomal recessive mode  <cit> . the widespread use of elite sires by means of artificial insemination makes cattle populations highly susceptible to the propagation of recessively inherited disorders  <cit> . however, the availability of dense snp genotyping arrays facilitates the rapid identification of underlying genomic regions  <cit> .

this paper details a disorder that resembles bovine hereditary zinc deficiency , an autosomal recessive condition, primarily seen in holstein-friesian calves  <cit> . this disease is characterized by an impaired function of the immune system, growth retardation and skin alterations as a result of a deficient gastrointestinal zinc absorption  <cit> . while affected animals are born without apparent clinical symptoms, first skin lesions emerge between the age of four and eight weeks  <cit> . impairment of immune functions makes affected animals more susceptible to infectious pathogens and leads to an increased incidence of common calf diseases, e.g., enteritis and pneumonia  <cit> . highly-dosed oral zinc supplementation ameliorates clinical symptoms in affected holstein-friesian animals, however, if untreated, bhzd is lethal  <cit> . inherited zinc absorption disorders, caused by mutations in the zinc transporter encoding gene slc39a <dig>  have been reported for several mammalian species, including mouse and human . in holstein-friesian cattle, bhzd is caused by a splice-site variant in slc39a4
 <cit> . hereditary zinc absorption disorders have not yet been described in the fleckvieh population.

here we show that a phenotype of fleckvieh calves that resembles bhzd is not caused by a defective zinc transporter gene. genome-wide association analysis, autozygosity mapping and analysis of whole-genome sequencing data enabled to identify a nonsense mutation in the phospholipase d family member  <dig> encoding gene  which is likely causal for the observed phenotype.

RESULTS
phenotypic manifestation of the defect
seven calves between the age of seven and 17 weeks with severe skin lesions and poor general health status were admitted to the clinic of ruminants. clinical findings such as scaling and crusting of skin and secondary adhesion of hair were most evident around the muzzle, the eyes, above the sternum and on the extremities . skin of the inguinal region was seborrhoeic and all palpable lymph nodes were enlarged. the calves suffered from erosions in the interdigital spaces and erosive or ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa . all animals were underdeveloped in height and weight and had a history of recurring diarrhoea and pneumonia. two of the calves were supplemented with dietary zinc , but did not respond to the treatment. due to the advanced state of the disease and with no prospect for improvement, all animals were euthanized and subjected to necropsy.

in hematoxylin and eosin  stained sections, the skin of the affected animals displayed a mild to severe chronic dermatitis with serocellular crusting and partial superficial bacterial colonization. multiple intracorneal and intraepidermal accumulations of serum as well as multiple ulcerations and epidermal necroses were present. the epidermis was severely oedematous in multiple sections . dermis and epidermis were diffusely infiltrated by a moderate to high number of neutrophils. besides moderate oedema, the dermis exhibited infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells to a limited extent. in the cases where the thymus was examined, decreased thymic cellularity and poorly demarcated cortex-medulla-border were observed. further, the clinical diagnoses of enteritis and pneumonia were confirmed during the pathological examination.figure  <dig>

in addition to the seven cases described above, another fleckvieh calf  with severe alterations of the skin and diarrhoea was reported by a veterinarian. the described lesions were very similar to the phenotype of the previously reported seven calves. the calf received dietary zinc  for a period of two weeks. however, the overall condition of the animal did not improve and the calf died at the age of 13 weeks.

inspection of the pedigrees of the affected calves revealed a common ancestor suggesting a genetic background. on the basis of the patients’ history, the clinical and pathological findings, the calves were tentatively diagnosed to suffer from bhzd.

analysis of slc39a <dig> –the gene causing bhzd in holstein-friesian
mutations in slc39a <dig> are known to cause defects resembling the phenotypic appearance of the eight affected fleckvieh calves in various species including cattle  <cit> . slc39a <dig> is located at the proximal region of bovine chromosome  <dig> . the gene was re-sequenced in a case–control panel consisting of all affected animals, all available dams and sires and randomly selected, unaffected control animals. totally ~7 kb of genomic sequence was screened, resulting in the detection of ten snps . the mutation causing bhzd in holstein-friesian was not present in the diseased animals and none of the detected polymorphisms was associated with the disease phenotype, nor was any of the polymorphic sites compatible with the supposed pattern of recessive inheritance.

identification of the disease-associated region
since the analysis of slc39a <dig> did not reveal a potentially causal mutation, we applied an array-based approach to identify the underlying genomic region. the eight affected calves together with  <dig>  unaffected fleckvieh bulls were genotyped with the illumina bovinehd beadchip. a genome-wide association study using genotypes of  <dig>  snps revealed a strong association signal on bta  <dig>  eighty-two snps located within an  <dig>  mb interval from  <dig> ,245 bp to  <dig> ,740 bp were significantly associated  . the most prominent association signal  was observed for bovinehd <dig>  located at  <dig> ,257 bp. as expected, the proximal region of bta  <dig> harbouring slc39a <dig> did not show association at all.figure  <dig>

.



autozygosity mapping within the distal region of bta  <dig> revealed a common  <dig>  kb segment of extended homozygosity in the eight affected animals  . however, one out of  <dig>  animals of the control group was homozygous for the disease-associated region as well. signal intensities obtained from high-density genotyping revealed no indication for the presence of large structural variants  within the associated region .

the frequency of the associated haplotype was estimated in a sample of  <dig>  unaffected fleckvieh animals. among them,  <dig> were heterozygous carriers and three were homozygous, yielding a frequency for the associated haplotype of  <dig> %. the haplotype distribution shows no deviation from the hardy-weinberg equilibrium .

analysis of crip1and crip2– genes with similar function as slc39a4
the segment of extended homozygosity contains  <dig> transcripts and protein encoding genes, respectively . two of these genes encode cysteine-rich proteins . crips are highly expressed in the intestine  <cit>  and are essential for zinc absorption as well as for immune system related cytokine regulation  <cit> . thus, they represent excellent candidate genes for the observed disease phenotype.

crip <dig> and crip <dig>  were re-sequenced in the case–control panel. we screened ~6 kb of the genomic sequence of crip <dig>  resulting in the detection of  <dig> snps and two insertion/deletion  polymorphisms . approximately 8 kb of the genomic sequence of crip <dig> were screened, resulting in the identification of  <dig> snps . none of the variants in crip <dig> and crip <dig> was compatible with the disease phenotype. thus, variation in the two positional and functional candidate genes is likely not causal for the observed disease.

identification of the underlying mutation by exploiting whole-genome sequencing data
in a next attempt to identify the causal mutation, one of the affected calves  and one of the unaffected homozygous animals  were re-sequenced together with  <dig> animals of the fv population  <cit> . multi-sample variant calling yielded genotypes for  <dig>  polymorphic sites within the  <dig>  kb disease-associated segment at the distal end of bta  <dig>  sequence coverage in the disease-associated region averaged  <dig> x and  <dig> x for  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the positions being covered with more than one read. haplotype analysis revealed that none of  <dig> re-sequenced control animals carried the disease-associated haplotype. three snps and one indel were compatible with recessive inheritance, i.e., they were homozygous for the alternative allele  in the affected calf, heterozygous  or homozygous for the reference allele  in  <dig> and homozygous for the reference allele  in all  <dig> remaining animals . none of the four polymorphisms were located within the coding regions of two candidate genes crip <dig> and crip <dig> table  <dig>

genotypes for the nonsense-mutation  were obtained for  <dig>  animals representing three different breeds , holstein-friesian  and braunvieh ) using a taqman® genotyping assay. the nonsense-mutation is homozygous in the affected calves only. the mutation does not segregate in holstein-friesian and braunvieh. note that animals carrying the disease haplotype were specifically added to fleckvieh panel.



survival rate of progeny descending from bulls carrying the p.w215x-mutation
in order to study the effect of the deleterious allele on the population level, we estimated the survival rate of the descendants from different mating types with regard to the p.w215x-genotype in sires and maternal grandsires. if both, sire and maternal grandsire are heterozygous for the p.w215x-mutation, the probability of the resulting calf being homozygous is  <dig> %. the survival rate of calves descending from such matings  is significantly lower  compared to the survival rate of calves descending from non-risk matings across all age classes, as expected in the case of recessive inheritance of the deleterious allele . at day  <dig>   <dig> % of the calves resulting from risk matings have perished, while the mortality of calves descending from non-risk matings is  <dig> % only .figure  <dig>

discussion
eight calves with severe skin lesions and poor general health status were recently identified in the fleckvieh cattle population. clinical and pathological examinations of affected animals showed striking similarities to findings described for individuals suffering from zinc deficiency in cattle  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . inherited zinc absorption disorders, resulting from mutations in slc39a4
 <cit> , can be ameliorated by highly-dosed oral zinc supplementation  <cit> . however the fleckvieh calves did not respond to oral zinc supplementation. variants in slc39a <dig> could be excluded from being causal for the phenotype of the affected fleckvieh animals, suggesting a different aetiological basis of the syndrome observed in the fleckvieh calves.

genome-wide association analysis followed by autozygosity mapping identified a common  <dig>  kb segment of extended homozygosity on bta  <dig> in the affected calves. variants in two genes  with functional similarity to slc39a4
 <cit>  were excluded to be associated with the phenotype of the affected calves. finally, genome-wide re-sequencing of one of the affected calves revealed a putatively causal loss-of-function mutation in the phospholipase d family member  <dig> encoding gene pld <dig>  given the relatively low fold sequence coverage, some variants might have been wrongly called and lost, respectively. however, multi-sample variant calling followed by population-based genotype imputation as applied in the present study provides high quality genotypes even for lowly covered sites  <cit> . the p.w125x-mutation was perfectly associated in a panel of  <dig>  animals, further substantiating our suspicion of causality.

phospholipase d <dig> is a member of the family of phospholipid signalling enzymes  <cit>  and is mainly expressed in spleen and early microglia, suggesting a role in immunological pathways  <cit> . although pld <dig> seems to be involved in phagocytosis, little is known about its enzymatic function in cells  <cit> . recent studies revealed an association between variants in pld <dig> and two autoimmune diseases in human, namely systemic sclerosis  <cit>  and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , disorders with inflammatory skin lesions  <cit>  and interstitial lung diseases  <cit> . furthermore, knock-out mice with a nonsense mutation in pld <dig> manifest a phenotype with thin hair and growth retardation  <cit> . in addition, arun et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated the importance of phospholipase family d members in mediating the repair of plasma membrane disruptions in mice keratinocytes emphasising the role of these phospholipid signalling enzymes in membrane function and wound healing. a mutation in a phospholipase-domain containing protein  results in a severe cornification disorder in dogs, providing evidence for a key role of lipases in the keratinisation process and the metabolism of the epidermal barrier in general  <cit> . taken together, it seems very likely that an impaired function of pld <dig> is causal for the severe skin lesions and the poor general health status of the affected calves.

compared to the wild-type protein, the pld <dig> protein is predicted to be shortened by  <dig> amino acids in the affected calves. the truncated protein may be retained with an impaired function and/or the transcript may be degraded via nonsense-mediated mrna decay  <cit> . if the truncated protein is retained, its function is likely to be severely compromised as it lacks essential domains for enzymatic activity  <cit> . however, the actual effect of the mutation on the expression of pld <dig> needs to be unravelled in subsequent studies.

although there is a striking similarity in the phenotypic appearance of the fleckvieh calves and holstein-friesian animals suffering from bhzd  <cit> , there are no clues for a connection between pld <dig> and zinc metabolism. furthermore, zinc supplementation did not ameliorate any of the symptoms of the affected calves, corroborating that impaired zinc metabolism might not be causal for the phenotype. based on our findings the tentative diagnosis of zinc deficiency can no longer be maintained.

haplotype analysis revealed that three unaffected animals are homozygous for the associated haplotype. however, none of them was homozygous for the p.w215x-mutation. it seems likely that the mutation might have occurred in the germline of a recent founder animal, resulting in two identical haplotypes differing for the deleterious allele only. a similar situation has been observed for the arachnomelia syndrome  in brown swiss cattle  <cit> . using array-derived genotypes does not allow distinguishing between animals carrying the affected and unaffected haplotype version. thus, the haplotype frequency derived from array-based genotypes  is higher than the frequency of the p.w125x-mutation. the frequency of the p.w215x-mutation was estimated to  <dig> % only in the current fleckvieh population. however, the widespread use of a single bull carrying the defect allele could lead to a rapid increase of the frequency within few generations. since array-based genotypes are routinely obtained for all candidate bulls, animals carrying the disease-associated haplotype can now be easily identified. such animals should be directly genotyped for the p.w215x-mutation and animals carrying the mutation should be excluded from artificial insemination. this cost-effective approach will prevent unneeded animal suffering and economic losses by avoiding inadvertent carrier x carrier matings.

assuming a frequency of  <dig> % of the deleterious allele in the fleckvieh population, equal use of all bulls and ~ <dig> , <dig> annual births, one would expect  <dig> affected calves per year. the actual number of expected cases is probably somewhat lower, as most carriers are related and farmers avoid close inbreeding. furthermore, most of these cases will probably not be reported since the affected calves die due to rather unspecific diseases  before the manifestation of characteristic symptoms . the significantly reduced survival rate of descendants from risk matings supports this assumption. however, incomplete penetrance could also reduce the observed incidences. therefore it will be important to study animals being homozygous for the identified mutation from birth in a controlled environment for a better characterisation of the disorder.

CONCLUSIONS
a recessively inherited condition in fleckvieh cattle resembles the phenotypic appearance of bovine hereditary zinc deficiency. our results strongly support that a nonsense mutation  in the pld <dig> encoding gene is causative for this disease in the fleckvieh breed and that zinc deficiency is not involved in the aetiology of the disease. further studies are necessary to unravel the detailed genotype-phenotype relationship. however, the identification of the causal variant allows for broad testing in the fleckvieh population. hence, an efficient management of this new defect is now possible.
