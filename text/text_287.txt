BACKGROUND
it is widely recognized that mammalian egg zona pellucida  plays critical roles during oogenesis, fertilization, and preimplantation development  <cit> . initially, three glycoproteins  were identified and characterized in the mouse egg zp  <cit> , but recently an additional zp glycoprotein  was also discovered in several mammalian species, such as the laboratory rat, human and primate species  <cit> . over past two decades, extensive experimental studies have been conducted to assess the role of individual zp glycoproteins in mediating gamete recognition during fertilization. for instance, zp <dig> and zp <dig> have been reported as primary and secondary sperm receptors in mice  <cit> . some studies further identified a region of mouse zp <dig> that possesses sperm receptor activity and defined this region as the 'sperm combing-site' located in the polypeptide encoded by mouse zp <dig> exon- <dig>  <cit> . however, some other studies highlight a three-dimensional zp structure necessary for sperm binding, rather than individual proteins  <cit> . a recent study reveals that sperm-egg recognition in mice depends on the cleavage status of zp <dig>  but is unaffected by the zp <dig> mutations at the sperm combining-site   <cit> .

although the relative contribution of individual zp glycoproteins remains arguable, a large body of evidence has established that mammalian zp glycoproteins are responsible for species-restricted binding of sperm to unfertilized eggs, inducing the sperm acrosome reaction, and preventing polyspermy  <cit> . there is no doubt that mammalian egg zp represents a barrier to heterospecific fertilization  <cit> , and thus probably somehow contributes to reproductive isolation between species.

it is well known that proteins involved in reproduction, such as those mediating sperm-egg interactions, often have undergone adaptive evolution, driven by positive natural selection  <cit> . among those zp glycoproteins in mammals, evidence for rapid evolution resulted from positive selection has been found for both zp <dig> and zp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, several amino acid sites from both zps were identified to be under positive selection  <cit> . most strikingly, some of positively selected sites in zp <dig> are adjacent to or within the sperm combing-site that is essential for binding activity. these results provide support to several nonexclusive hypotheses including sperm competition, cryptic female choice, sexual conflict, reinforcement, avoidance of heterospecific fertilization, and pathogen resistance, to interpret this widespread phenomenon of rapid evolution in reproductive proteins  <cit> .

in mammals, earlier studies on molecular evolution of reproductive
proteins primarily concentrated on diverged species , while more recent studies have shifted to examine genetic variation of reproductive proteins at both intraspecific and interspecific levels . such intra- and inter-specific studies would provide important insights into not just how genetic information flows from generation to generation within species, but also how it has flowed from ancestral species  to descendants. strikingly, there is so far an apparent lack of studies on molecular evolution of reproductive proteins in a group of closely related mammalian species, except for small rodents  <cit> . only few single nucleotide polymorphisms from reproduction-related loci have been reported in several mountain ungulate species  <cit> .

herein we report genetic variation and evolutionary patterns of two egg zp glycoproteins  at both intra- and inter-specific levels in seven representative large mammalian species from the bovini tribe. the members of this tribe include large animals of great economic and cultural significance to humans such as domestic cattle , asiatic water buffalo , and the yak , as well as some of the larger grazers including african buffalo , european bison or wisent , and american bison . despite their importance, the naming of these species from the bovini tribe is still debatable and for that reason we adopted the classification system suggested by wilson and reeder's taxonomic reference  <cit> , complemented by the names of wild versus domestic animals  <cit> . indeed, speciation between species from bos and bison is considered incomplete as interspecific hybridization is still occurring  <cit> . the degree of fertility of hybrids or crosses between bos and bison species varies depending on which species pairs are crossed. for instance, both female and male hybrids between b. taurus and b. indicus are completely fertile, whereas for interspecific hybridization between other bos and bison species female hybrids are fertile and male hybrids are sterile. thus, these bovine species apparently represent a good model system to test whether zp glycoproteins contribute to reproductive isolation between such large mammalian species.

methods
samples and genomic dna extraction
we analyzed a panel of bovine samples including: domestic cattle , domestic yak , gayal , european bison or wisent , asiatic water buffalo , and african buffalo . tissue samples were collected from countries across three continents: yemen , turkmenistan , kyrgyzstan , kazakhstan , mongolia , china , india , myanmar , egypt , morocco , kenya , and portugal . moreover, two individuals each of domestic goat  and sheep  were also included as outgroups. an endeavor was made to avoid sampling related individuals. genomic dna was extracted by dneasy blood & tissue kit .

pcr amplification and sequencing
the primer pair zp2-x8f  and zp2-x9r  was used to amplify a fragment spanning the exons 8- <dig> of zp <dig> gene, whereas the primer pair zp3a-x3f  and zp3a-x4r  was used to amplify a fragment spanning the exons 3- <dig> of zp <dig> gene. both primer pairs were designed and tested to be polymorphic across several closely related wild goat species  <cit> . pcr reactions were performed in a  <dig> μl volume containing 10x pcr buffer,  <dig>  and  <dig>   mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig> μm each primer,  <dig>  u platinum® taq dna polymerase , and approximately  <dig> ng genomic dna. the pcr mixture underwent  <dig> min at  <dig> °c,  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at  <dig> °c,  <dig> s at  <dig> °c, and  <dig> s at  <dig> °c, and final  <dig> min at  <dig> °c on geneamp pcr system  <dig> . pcr products were purified and sequenced for both strands, at the high-throughput genomics unit , department of genome sciences, university of washington . sequence trace files were checked and aligned using software package dnastar v <dig>  . all sequences generated for this study have been deposited in genbank with accession numbers hm631669-hm <dig> 

data analyses
haplotype phases from sequences with heterozygous sites were reconstructed by dnasp v <dig>   <cit> , which exactly implements a coalescent-based bayesian method by phase  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . five independent runs with default options were initially performed to check for consistency between runs and an additional run, with  <dig> times longer iterations, was conducted to obtain final results. all diversity measures and neutrality tests such as tajima's d  <cit> , fu and li's d and f  <cit> , and fay and wu's h  <cit>  were calculated at species level, using dnasp v <dig>   <cit> . the significance for these neutrality tests was obtained using  <dig>  coalescent simulations in dnasp. the average pairwise differences among seven bovine species for the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> sequence data were calculated by arlequin v <dig>   <cit> .

phylogenetic relations among haplotype sequences  of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> were independently reconstructed by bayesian approach as implemented in mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the prior best-fitting nucleotide substitution models were separately selected for the coding and non-coding parts of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig>  respectively. each model was selected by modeltest  <dig>   <cit>  based on likelihood ratio tests. the kimura-2-paramter  model  with different 'tratio' values was selected for the coding and non-coding parts of the zp2; the k <dig> model with different 'tratio' values and 'rates' were selected for the coding  and non-coding  parts of the zp <dig>  we applied the selected models with commend 'unlink tratio =  statefreq = ' to the coding and non-coding partitions for both the zp <dig> and zp <dig> in mrbayes analyses. two independent analyses starting from different random trees were performed, and four mcmc chains were run for six million generations with sampling every  <dig> generations. six thousand trees were discarded as burn-in, after checking for convergence. moreover, for the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotype sequences, we also constructed median-joining networks  <cit>  with program network version  <dig>   to display relations among haplotypes.

in addition, we calculated the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site  and their variances using bootstrap method with  <dig> replications in mega <dig>   <cit> , for sequence pairs of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotypes. with this information, we tested the null hypothesis of neutrality  versus alternative hypotheses of positive selection  or purifying selection  using a z-test  <cit> . to further detect the presence and the location of selection, the codon-based sequence alignments of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotypes were subjected to the sitewise likelihood-ratio  test  <cit> , guided by a neighbor-joining tree constructed under p-distance model in mega <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence polymorphism and divergence
for the zp <dig> gene, a 310-bp sequence fragment was obtained after trimming the primer sequences, including  <dig> bp of the exon  <dig>   <dig> bp of the intron  <dig>  and  <dig> bp of the exon  <dig>  there were  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms   detected among all sequences including the outgroup species, defining  <dig> haplotypes . without the outgroup species, there was a total of  <dig> snps  in seven bovine species.

for the zp <dig> gene, a 279-bp sequence fragment was obtained after trimming the primer sequences, including  <dig> bp of the exon  <dig>   <dig> bp of the intron  <dig>  and  <dig> bp of the exon  <dig>  there were  <dig> snps  identified among all sequences including the outgroup species, defining  <dig> haplotype sequences . after removal of the outgroup species, there was a total of  <dig> snps  in seven bovine species. notably, a two-codon repeat  in the exon  <dig> was detected in one individual of taurine cattle from morocco .

low levels of intraspecific polymorphism were found in seven bovine species for the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> sequence fragments . for example, no any single snp was detected in  <dig> chromosomes of african buffalo for the zp <dig> and in  <dig> chromosomes of the yak for the zp <dig>  respectively. moreover, there was also no any single snp in four chromosomes of the european bison for the two genes. at species level, four neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum were used to test for deviations from neutral equilibrium expectations. despite the fact that different neutrality tests focus on different aspects of the frequency spectrum , but we found that none of the tests was significant for the zp <dig> or the zp <dig> sequence data across all species, where tests were applicable .

* n = number of chromosomes; h = number of haplotypes; hd = haplotype  diversity; s = number of segregating sites; π = nucleotide diversity ; θw = watterson's estimator ; n.a. = not applicable. all p-values for tajima's d, fu and li's d and f are >  <dig> ; all p-values for fay and wu's h are >  <dig> .

as expected, we also observed low levels of sequence divergence among seven bovine species . among five species from bos and bison, the average pairwise differences ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the zp <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the zp <dig>  most distinctly, several haplotypes were shared by multiple species from bos and bison.

phylogenetic analyses
the bayesian trees were constructed to display phylogenetic relations among the haplotype sequences  for the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> genes . the branching pattern was nearly identical between the two phylogenies. most noticeably, the haplotype sequences from the same species were not monophyletic. as expected, the five species from bos and bison formed a monophyletic clade, but with unresolved internal relationships. the buffalo  species versus non-buffalo  species formed reciprocally monophyletic groups in the zp <dig> phylogeny, being similar to the phylogenetic tree by maceachern et al  <cit> .

network analyses of coding haplotypes
there were eight coding haplotypes from the  <dig> bp coding sequence fragment of the zp <dig> gene, of which the haplotypes zp2cdh <dig> and zp2cdh <dig> were predominant and shared by four and five bovine species, respectively . noticeably, only three haplotypes were identified in  <dig> chromosomes of five species from bos and bison. for the zp <dig> gene,  <dig> coding haplotypes were defined by  <dig> coding snps  in the  <dig> bp coding sequence fragment, of which one predominant haplotype zp3cdh <dig> occurred  <dig> times, shared by b. taurus, b. indicus and b. frontalis . interestingly, there was no any single nonsynonymous mutation detected in, at least,  <dig> mutation steps from the zp3cdh <dig> to the two outgroup species, i.e., the domestic sheep and goat .

codon-based tests of selection
the z-tests rejected the null hypothesis of neutrality  in favor of the alternative hypothesis of purifying selection  for the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotype sequences. among  <dig> sequence pairs from the eight zp <dig> coding haplotypes,  <dig> were significant at the 5% level for z-tests, but mainly confined in those sequence pairs with the two outgroup species . however,  <dig> of  <dig> sequence pairs from the  <dig> zp <dig> coding haplotypes were significant at the 5% level for z-tests, of which  <dig> were from sequence pairs among seven bovine species .

although evidence for purifying selection has been revealed by z-tests for both the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotype sequences, it remains unknown which sites  have been under purifying selection. we used the slr method to further calculate the dn/ds ratio  for all codons of the zp <dig>  and the zp <dig>  coding haplotypes. in slr test, ω value < <dig> indicates purifying selection, while value > <dig> indicates positive selection  <cit> . we detected four codons  under purifying selection in the zp <dig> data, showing ω values <  <dig> with a cutoff >95%, after correcting the slr test for multiple comparisons. however, no any specific codon was detected to be under purifying selection in the zp <dig> data.

discussion
our study examined both intra- and inter-specific genetic variation of two sequence fragments each from reproductive genes zp <dig> and zp <dig>  in seven representative species from the bovini tribe. a general pattern of low levels of sequence polymorphism and divergence has been detected for those two sequenced fragments . due to small sample size for some species studied , the low level of intraspecific variation could be, at first sight, attributable to the effect of sample size. in fact, such a pattern of low polymorphism and divergence was not really ascribed to the sample size, except for an extreme case of european bison, but to the sequence conservation of those two sequenced fragments. several observations provided strong support to this scenario. first, the sample sizes for domestic cattle  were not such small, but the pattern of low levels of intraspecific variation still remained . second, the codon-based z-tests revealed evidence for purifying selection in pairwise comparisons of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> coding haplotype sequences , suggesting the evolution of the sequenced fragments of the two genes under functional and structural constraints. finally, the sequenced fragments of the zp <dig>  and the zp <dig>  are located at zona pellucida domains, which have been demonstrated to be well conserved in a wide variety of mammalian species  <cit> .

it is worthy of note that several haplotypes were shared by multiple bovine species for both genes, for instance, the haplotype zp2h <dig>  shared by five species from bos and bison . there were, at least, eight coding snps shared by species from bos and bison for the two genes, segregating from the outgroup species, i.e., the domestic goat and sheep . such a pattern of haplotype sharing can be explained by either introgressive hybridization or retention of ancestral polymorphism  <cit> . the hypothesis of introgressive hybridization is plausible in that interspecific hybridization among species from bos or bison often occurs  <cit> . however, a recent study attempting to reconstruct phylogeny of the bovini tribe revealed that shared haplotypes among bovine species might be the result of the retention of ancestral polymorphism  <cit> .

to test whether retention of ancestral polymorphism contributed to haplotype sharing among species from bos and bison and to identify specific shared polymorphisms, we looked into patterns of mutations at both sequenced fragments of the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> genes. a fixed coding mutation  at position  <dig> of the zp <dig> was segregated between non-buffalo  species and buffalo  species or the outgroup species  ; a fixed non-coding mutation  at position  <dig> and a fixed coding mutation  at  <dig> of the zp <dig> were also completely differentiated between non-buffalo  species and buffalo  species or the outgroup species  . it is clear that those three shared polymorphisms among bos and bison species were derived from their most recent common ancestor after divergence from buffalo  species, but were retained during divergence and evolution of bos and bison species. thus, such shared polymorphisms provide unequivocal evidence that haplotype sharing among bos and bison species can be, at least, partially attributed to retention of ancestral polymorphism.

in reality, it is difficult to determine whether these shared haplotypes are remnants of ancestral polymorphism or traces of recent introgression events  <cit> , but a recent study suggests that geographic distribution of shared haplotypes would help to disentangle introgression from ancestral polymorphism  <cit> . to further define a specific shared haplotype due to one of two hypotheses, we mapped all coding haplotypes of both genes on their geographic distribution . for the zp <dig>  the shared haplotypes zp2cdh <dig>  and zp2cdh <dig>  are found in samples of multiple bos species across africa , middle east , central asia , south asia , and northeast asia . for the zp <dig>  the shared haplotype zp3cdh <dig>  is also found in samples of multiple bos species across africa, middle east, central asia, south asia, and northeast asia. however, the shared haplotype zp3cdh <dig>  is only detected in b. indicus from india and b. frontalis from myanmar, while the shared haplotype zp3cdh <dig>  is only present in b. indicus from india and b. grunniens from china. given that, interspecific hybridization between bos species mainly occurs in south asia and central asia  <cit> , and therefore the shared haplotypes zp3cdh <dig> and zp3cdh <dig> can be simply explained by hybridization events. since there is no clear evidence for hybridization between bos species and european bison , although well-documented evidence for hybridization between b. taurus and american bison  exists  <cit> , the haplotype zp2cdh <dig> shared by bos and bison species is most probably due to retention of ancestral polymorphism, rather than to introgressive hybridization. when scrutinizing phylogenetic relations among coding haplotypes of both genes as shown in networks , both the shared haplotypes zp2cdh <dig> and zp3cdh <dig> are located at external nodes of network, compared to the outgroup species through buffalo  species. based on the assumption that on average the external haplotypes in the haplotype networks should be younger than those internal ones  <cit> , the haplotypes zp2cdh <dig> and zp3cdh <dig> shared by multiple bos species represent relatively recent derived haplotypes at high-frequency, being compatible with a scenario of recent hybridization. indeed, the recent worldwide spread  of domesticated bos species  mediated by humans may have potentiated this scenario. taken together, none of the two hypotheses alone can fully interpret the presence of shared sequences in the zp <dig> and zp <dig> genes among bos and bison species. indeed, these two hypotheses are reciprocally non-exclusive and therefore both hypotheses can account for our observations of haplotype sharing in the zp <dig> and zp <dig> genes among bos and bison species. our observations of haplotype sharing suggest that adaptive alleles can flow into domestic cattle gene pools from other bovine species via introgressive hybridization, and highlight south asia as the diversity hotspot for bovine species.

a general genetic pattern of rapid evolution driven by positive nature selection has been revealed for reproductive proteins  <cit> . this pattern has also been detected in the zp <dig> and the zp <dig> glycoproteins of some mammalian species  <cit> . in contrast, we found evidence for purifying  selection in the sequenced fragments of the zp <dig>  and the zp <dig>  genes, rather than positive selection. the molecular signatures of negative selection detected in this study can be easily explained by functional and structural constraints acting on the two sequenced fragments each of the two genes, both of which are located at the conserved zp domains  <cit> .

it should be aware that previous evidence of positive selection in zp glycoproteins of mammalian species is not robust and consistent among different studies. for instance, a reanalysis of mus zp <dig> data from jansa et al.  <cit>  showed no evidence for positive selection after removal of the outgroup sequences  <cit> . berlin and smith  <cit>  analyzed a zp <dig> data set of  <dig> mammalian species including those eight species analyzed by swanson et al.  <cit>  and found no evidence for positive selection in zp <dig> gene of those  <dig> species. in addition, simulation analysis by berlin and smith  <cit>  showed that the likelihood ratio test  comparing m7-m <dig> that was used by swanson et al.  <cit>  suffers false positives under fairly simple scenarios, suggesting that the m7-m <dig> lrt alone does not provide solid evidence for positive selection. it should also be noticed that the m0-m <dig> lrt used by swanson et al.  <cit>  is no longer recommended to test evidence of positive selection  <cit> . to further test whether evidence of positive selection in mammalian zp <dig> and zp <dig> genes is robust and consistent, we applied the codeml site models in paml version  <dig>   <cit>  to two data sets each for mammalian zp <dig>  and zp <dig>  full coding sequences, collected from genbank database . both data sets of zp <dig> and zp <dig> genes include those eight mammalian species analyzed by swanson et al.  <cit> . most strikingly, we also found no evidence of positive selection in the zp <dig> data of  <dig> species, by the three lrts comparing m1a-m2a, m7-m <dig>  and m8a-m <dig> models, respectively , being in line with previous results by berlin and smith  <cit> . when considering only those eight species analyzed by swanson et al.  <cit> , both the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> lrts were not significant, whereas the m7-m <dig> lrt was significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). however, for the zp <dig> data of  <dig> species, the m7-m <dig> and m8a-m <dig> lrts were significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; 2Δlnl =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but the m1a-m2a lrt was non-significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). likewise, when focusing on only those eight species analyzed by swanson et al.  <cit> , three ltrs yielded similar results as those from the zp <dig> data of  <dig> species . moreover, we identified one site  in the zp <dig> data set of  <dig> species and four sites  in the zp <dig> data of eight species under positive selection with posterior probabilities > 90%. our analyses on real data sets of both mammalian zp <dig> and zp <dig> genes are congruent with previous simulation analyses showing that the m1a-m2a and m8a-m <dig> comparisons are more robust than the m7-m <dig> comparison  <cit> . taken these observations into account, we conclude that there is no evidence of positive selection in zp <dig> gene of these mammalian species studied, and that there is some  evidence of positive selection in zp <dig> gene of these mammalian species studied. it is therefore not strange to find evidence of purifying selection in the sequenced fragment of zp <dig> gene in bovine species.

we also noticed that evidence for positive selection was detected in zp <dig> gene of new guinean and australasian murine species, by using three lrts comparing m1a-m2a, m7-m <dig>  and m8a-m <dig> models  <cit> . in addition, three amino acid sites  within the polypeptide  encoded by mouse zp <dig> exon- <dig> were identified to be under positive selection. the polypeptide encoded by mouse zp <dig> exon- <dig> containing sperm combing-site of zp <dig> has been demonstrated to be essential for sperm-binding activity by in vitro functional experiments  <cit> . however, when considering only australasian murine species, three lrts were not significant at all  <cit> . these results from murine rodents suggest that there is lack of a general pattern of rapid evolution driven by positive selection in zp <dig> gene across mammalian species. contrary to mammalian zp <dig>  we found evidence of positive selection in mammalian zp <dig> with several positively selected amino acid sites , indicating that mammalian zp <dig> might have played a more important role in sperm-egg interaction than previously thought. although, some authors still support sperm-binding model mediated by zp <dig>  <cit> , such model has been called into questions and is gradually replaced by a three-dimensional zp structure model  <cit> . the latter model is further supported by a recent study showing that sperm-egg recognition in mouse depends on the cleavage status of zp <dig>  but is unaffected by the zp <dig> mutations in the sperm combining-site  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have demonstrated that genes or genomic regions  that contribute to reproductive isolation between species often evolve rapidly and show little or no gene flow between species  <cit> . if this postulate is true, then our findings suggest that these two zp genes may not play an important role in reproductive isolation between the bovine species as it was defended in a recent functional study  <cit> . nonetheless, future experiments comparing sperm-binding capacity between bovine species pairs with different degrees of fertility of hybrid offspring are needed. alternatively, our findings can also be interpreted as the exception to the fast-evolving patterns that were revealed from genes related to reproductive isolation in previous studies. if the latter is true, then our data would appeal a re-evaluation of the zp evolutionary rates in other mammalian lineages.
