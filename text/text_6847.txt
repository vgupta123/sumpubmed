BACKGROUND
mu opioid receptors play an essential role in mediating actions of morphine and most clinical analgesic agents such as codeine, methadone and oxycodone, as well as drugs of abuse such as heroin  <cit> . early pharmacological studies proposed several mu opioid receptor subtypes: mu <dig>  mu <dig> and morphine-6β-glucuronide   <cit> . molecular cloning of a mu opioid receptor <cit> , mor- <dig>  has provided an invaluable tool to explore multiple mu opioid receptors at the molecular level. however, only a single copy of the mu opioid receptor  gene has been identified  <cit> . alternative pre-mrna splicing and multiple promoters of the oprm gene have been hypothesized as molecular explanations of multiple mu opioid receptors. over the past ten years, we have extensively explored alternative splicing of the oprm gene, particularly of the mouse oprm gene. in addition to the rat mor-1b and human mor-1a reported earlier <cit> , we have identified  <dig> splice variants from the mouse oprm gene  <cit> , which are derived from various combinations of sixteen exons that span over  <dig> kb. we have also isolated  <dig> splice variants from the rat oprm gene and  <dig> from the human oprm gene  <cit> . the functional significance of these splice variants has been suggested by differences in their region-specific and cell-specific expressions, agonist-induced g protein coupling and receptor internalization <cit> .

the complexity of the oprm gene was further demonstrated by the identification of multiple promoters. initially, promoter activity was mapped to an approximately  <dig>  kb region upstream of exon  <dig>  in the mouse, rat and human oprm genes <cit> . a dual promoter model of the e <dig> promoter has been proposed, in which the dominant proximal promoter is approximately  <dig> bp apart from the distal promoter  <cit> . within numerous putative cis-acting elements predicted from the e <dig> promoter region by searching transcription factor databases, several cis-acting elements such as a sp binding sequence, a  <dig> bp element, a  <dig> bp polypyrimidine sequence, cre, oct <dig>  il-4-responsive element, nf-κappab, sox, and neuron-restrictive silencer element  in the proximal or distal promoters have been identified to interact with their trans-acting partners, which positively or negatively regulate the e <dig> promoter activity  <cit> . for example, nrsf  can bind to a  <dig> bp nrse element in the proximal promoter region to suppress the promoter activity  <cit> . interestingly, a  <dig> bp sp cis-acting element in the proximal promoter can function either as a negative element when bound to the m <dig> and m <dig> isoforms of sp <dig> or as a positive element by interacting with sp <dig> and sp <dig> <cit> . the poly binding proteins can interact with a  <dig> bp polypyrimidine sequence in the proximal promoter to enhance the transcription of mor- <dig> in nmb cells <cit> . tumor necrosis factor can induce the mu opioid receptor gene transcription in several types of immune cells. this induction has been suggested to be mediated through induced interaction between nf-κb factor and nf-κb binding sites located in e <dig> promoter <cit> .

recently, we have identified a new promoter  in the mouse oprm gene <cit> , which was located ~ <dig> kb upstream of the e <dig> promoter. the e <dig> promoter controls the expression of at least nine splice variants in the mouse oprm gene. a major transcription start point was mapped to a guanidine residue,  <dig> bp upstream from the putative translation start codon of e <dig> <cit> . a basal core region, a negative region and a positive region of the e <dig> promoter, were identified using sequential 5'- and 3'-deletion constructs in nie- <dig> cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. the basal core region contains a tata box that can specifically bind to a tata-binding protein  in a gel shifting assay <cit> . mutation analysis indicated that the tata box played an essential role in the e <dig> promoter activity, and that a nf- <dig> site and a cmyc/max site near tata box modulated basal core promoter activity <cit> .

the e <dig> promoter differs from the e <dig> promoter in several aspects. first, the e <dig> promoter contains a tata box that is absent in the e <dig> promoter. second, the e <dig> promoter has one major transcription start point , while the e <dig> promoter contains multiple tsp. third, although both promoters have several cis-acting elements such as caat box, ap- <dig> and nf-κb, the e <dig> promoter contains several gc-rich cis-acting elements like sp <dig> and ap- <dig> that are missing in the e <dig> promoter. sp <dig> regulates a number of tata-less promoters. thus, the e <dig> promoter appears to be a typical eukaryote class ii promoter associated with rna polymerase ii, while the e <dig> promoter favors a "housekeeping" gene mode. finally, the e <dig> promoter drives transcription of  <dig> variants, while the e <dig> promoter controls the expression of  <dig> other variant transcripts, three of which can translate into the same mor- <dig> protein.

most promoter studies were performed in vitro using different cell models. although transgenic technology has been widely used to characterize opioid receptor functions in vivo, there is little information about their use in studying transcriptional regulation of the opioid receptor genes, except for the transgenic studies of the mouse kappa opioid receptor  gene <cit> . in the present studies, we establish a transgenic mouse model using a single transgenic construct that contains a  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter region and an  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter region to drive expression of two reporters, tau/lacz and tau/gfp, respectively. this allows characterizing both e <dig> and e <dig> promoters in the same transgenic mice with x-gal staining and gfp imaging.

RESULTS
generation of the transgenic mouse line
in order to study both e <dig> and e <dig> promoters in mice, we made a ~ <dig> kb transgenic construct in a pbr <dig> vector . the construct contained a  <dig>  kb region upstream of e <dig> and an  <dig>  kb region upstream of e <dig> that controlled expression of an ires/tau/lacz cassette and an ires/tau/gfp cassette, respectively. our previous studies indicated that the  <dig>  kb region contained e <dig> promoter activity that was most evident in neuronal cells. a negative regulatory region, a basal core region containing a tata box and a positive regulatory region were identified within a  <dig> bp region at the 3'-end of the  <dig>  kb fragment. the  <dig>  kb fragment included the dual e <dig> promoters that were characterized by several groups  <cit>  and the regions further upstream.

the internal ribosome entry sequence  derived from the encephalomyocarditis virus can directly affect mrna cap-independent entry of the translational apparatus in mammalian cells <cit> . ires can efficiently drive the translation of downstream tau/lacz or tau/gfp fusion proteins in the construct. tau is a microtubule-associated protein distributed in the axonal microtubules of neurons <cit> . recently, tau/lacz and tau/gfp fusion proteins have been developed as a new generation of axon-targeting reporters that allow labeling subsets of neurons and their projections to study neuronal structure and function <cit> . tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters have been used successfully to reveal the projections of specific subsets of olfactory neurons to their axonal terminal glomeruli in knockin mouse models <cit> . therefore, tau/lacz and tau/gfp cassettes were designated in the construct as reporters for e <dig> and e <dig> promoter activities, respectively. we hope that by using the axon-targeting potential of tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters, we are able to map e <dig> and e <dig> promoter activities not only in their expressing cell bodies but also in their projections.

initially, six founder mice were obtained by microinjection of the construct into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs. continuously breeding these founder mice resulted in the establishment of two transgenic lines  that stably expressed the transgene. both transgenic lines showed a similar genotyping pattern with a major ~ <dig> kb, minor ~ <dig>  kb and weak ~ <dig>  kb bamhi digested genomic fragments in southern blot analysis using a  <dig>  kb gfp probe , although the d <dig> line had several additional weak bands. we also compared the transgene expression in both lines by using x-gal staining and gfp imaging. the results showed that both transgenic lines displayed a similar transgene expression pattern in several brain regions . we used the d <dig> line for the following studies. the transgenic mice were fertile and viable, with no gross morphological abnormalities.

expression of endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> mrnas in wild-type c57bl/6j mice during ontogeny
although expression of mor- <dig> or e <dig> promoter during ontogeny has been extensively studied using rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and in situ receptor binding <cit> , the expression of the e11-associated variants or e <dig> promoter during mouse development has not yet been reported. in order to evaluate whether the transgene in the transgenic mice has a temporal expression pattern similar to that of the endogenous e <dig> promoter, we first examined expression of the endogenous e <dig> mrna during development. we chose c57bl/6j mice because the transgenic mice were generated by backcrossing with c57bl/6j. since the e <dig> promoter controls expression of nine e11-associated variants in which e <dig> is the first exon <cit> , expression of e <dig> will be an assessment of the e <dig> promoter. we examined endogenous e <dig> mrna expression using a relative quantitative rt-pcr approach with primers derived from e <dig>  the results showed that expression of the  <dig> bp e <dig> transcript in wild-type c57bl/6j mice started at embryonic day  <dig>   . the expression levels of e <dig> mrna between e <dig>  and e <dig>  was quite low , and gradually increased to highest level in adult .

we also determined expression of a  <dig> bp exon 1/ <dig>  transcript that was controlled primarily by the e <dig> promoter using pcrs with the same 1st-strand cdnas as templates. as shown in figs. 3a &3b, the e1/ <dig> mrna was detected at e <dig> , which was four days earlier than the e <dig> mrna , suggesting early onset of the e <dig> promoter during development. the expression level of the e1/ <dig> transcript at e <dig>  and e <dig>  was low , slowly increased from e <dig>  to p <dig> , and reached to highest level in adult . our results are similar to those in the literature. zhu et al. reported the detection of mor- <dig> mrna at e <dig>  using an in situ hybridization approach with a -labeled rna probe derived from exon  <dig> <cit> , which was one day later than our result. using a combined rt-pcr/southern blot approach, ko et al. detected the expression of both the exon 1/ <dig> and the exon  <dig> transcripts controlled by the dual exon  <dig> promoters as early as e <dig>  <cit> , which was one day earlier than our result. these differences are likely the result of differences in the sensitivities of the assay methods or differences among the strains. however, all these studies observe an appearance of e <dig> activity at least  <dig> days prior to e <dig> activity.

the later onset of the e <dig> promoter activity during mouse embryonic development suggested differential regulation of the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters and raised questions regarding their functional roles in development. further investigation and identification of the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors involved in the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters will help illuminate the mechanisms behind such differential regulation.

the results also indicated higher levels of e1/ <dig> mrna than e <dig> mrna during development and in the adult. for example, the e1/ <dig> transcripts detected from e <dig>  to e <dig>  were  <dig> – 24-fold higher than the e <dig> transcripts . in adult brain, there was an >18-fold difference between the e1/ <dig> and e <dig> transcripts , which is consistent with our previous observations in the adult brain tissues <cit> . designing specific primers for amplifying e <dig> promoter-driven transcripts is difficult since some of the e11-associated variants also contain an exon  <dig> region that includes part of the proximal promoter sequence. therefore, the e1/ <dig> primers also amplifies several e11-associated variants that contain the exons 1– <dig> sequence. however, since the expression level of the e11-associated transcripts was much lower than that of e1-associated transcripts, we considered the pcr products generated from e1/ <dig> primers reasonable indications of e <dig> promoter activity. however, functional significance cannot be assigned only upon the overall abundance of a transcript. regional and cell-specific expression should also be taken into account. in previous studies, we have shown regional-specific or cell-specific expression of some variants at both mrna and protein levels <cit> . for example, expression of mor-1c mrna was quite low when using the rna from the total brain <cit> , but mor-1c protein was highly expressed in certain regions such as the lateral septum and median eminence, when compared to the expression of mor- <dig> protein <cit> . it will be interesting to further explore the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these e <dig> mrnas during development and in adult cns, using an in situ hybridization approach.

expression of the transgene mrnas in transgenic mice during ontogeny
in order to compare directly the endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> promoters with the transgenes, we examined the expression of endogenous e <dig> and e1/ <dig> mrna during development in the transgenic line using the same rt-pcr approach. since the 3'-end of exon  <dig> coding sequence was not included in the transgenic construct, the e <dig> primer used for the endogenous gene would not amplify the transgene. as shown in figs. 4a &4b, we observed the same expression profiles of e <dig> and e1/ <dig> mrna in the transgenic mice as seen in the wild-type c57bl/6j mice. the appearance of e <dig> and e1/ <dig> mrna was at e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively. the expression level of e <dig> transcript between e <dig>  and e <dig>  was also low , and gradually increased to the highest level in adult brain .

we then examined temporal expression of the transgenes using the same rnas in the rt-pcr with primers specifically designed for the transgenes. the e11/lacz mrna, which is controlled by the  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter in the transgenic construct, was detected as early as e <dig> , which was two days earlier than the onset of endogenous e <dig> mrna . the expression level of the e11/tau transcript at e <dig>  was quite low , and slowly increased to higher levels in adult brains . the e1/tau mrna, which was transcribed through the  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter in the transgenic construct, was detected at e <dig> , which was also two days earlier than the endogenous e1/ <dig> mrna . the expression level of e1/tau transcript between e <dig>  and e <dig>  was low , and gradually increased to higher levels in adult brain . the expression level of both e11/tau and e1/tau transcripts were comparable to those of the endogenous transcripts . these results confirm the same relative temporal appearance of the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters in the transgenic construct, with the e1/tau mrna appearing  <dig> days prior to the e <dig>  similar to that of the endogenous promoters. the earlier appearance of the transgene mrna may be due to a variety of factors. distal control elements may be lacking in the transgenic construct, or adjacent elements of the integration site may be influencing expression. nevertheless, the ability of the transgene to maintain the four day difference in expression between the two promoters implies that the transgenic mice provide a relevant model to study the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters in vivo.

distribution of tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters in the transgenic mouse central nervous system
we next examined brain distributions in the transgenic mice of the two reporter proteins, tau/lacz and tau/gfp, which were controlled by the transgenic e <dig> and e <dig> promoters, respectively, using x-gal staining and gfp imaging. x-gal staining for tau/lacz reporter activity, which is under the control of the e <dig> promoter, was examined in brain sections after perfusion, whereas gfp imaging for the tau/gfp reporter used fresh-frozen sections. sections with similar regions were selected for comparison.

we observed that both reporter activities were widely distributed in a number of brain regions, such as the piriform cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampal formation, thalamus, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, brainstem, purkinje cells and spinal cord . the distribution pattern of the tau/gfp reporter was generally comparable to that obtained from in situ hybridization studies using probes derived from mor- <dig>  sequences  <cit>  and to immunohistochemical studies using polyclonal antibodies generated against the last  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids of c-terminus of mor- <dig> in rat  <cit> . however, these published data were mainly derived from rat brain and spinal cord sections. to directly compare tau/gfp reporter with mor-1-li, we examined mor-1-li in brain and spinal cord of the transgenic and wide-type c57bl/6j mice with a polyclonal antibody against the last  <dig> amino acids of mor- <dig>  since the  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids are derived from exon  <dig>  we also refer this antibody immunoreactivity to exon 4-like immunoreactivity . we observed similar e4-li distributions in both the transgenic and wide-type c57bl/6j mice , suggesting that the transgene had little effect on e4-li distribution. as shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  e4-li in transgenic mice also was similar to studies in the rat  <cit> . for example, the hippocampal formation and the superficial laminae of the spinal cord were intensely labeled in both mice and rat.

e <dig> promoter activity indicated by x-gal staining of tau/lacz fusion protein, e <dig> promoter activity indicated by gfp imaging of tau/gfp fusion protein and exon 4-like immunoreactivity  shown by immunostaining with an e <dig> antibody in the selected areas of the transgenic mice are presented. the intensity of x-gal staining, green fluorescent protein signal and alex <dig> fluorescence of mor-1-li was visually estimated as high , moderate , low , very low , and negative . exon 11-like immunoreactivity  is from the literature <cit> .

the distribution of tau/gfp reporter mimicked that of e4-li in transgenic mice , including the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord. since e4-li represented the mor- <dig> expression mainly controlled by the e <dig> promoter, these results suggested that the tau/gfp reporter reasonably resembled the endogenous e <dig> promoter expression. however, there were some subtle differences. for example, tau/gfp reporter was primarily observed in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus, while the e4-li was distributed throughout the ca <dig>  ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions. in the spinal cord, both tau/gfp reporter and e4-li were heavily detected in the superficial laminae, but the tau/gfp reporter seemed to label more large neurons in the deep laminae. different targets designated by these two methods may explain these disparities. the tau/gfp reporter was driven by the transgenic e <dig> promoter, but e4-li only detected variants expressing the exon  <dig> sequences. there are  <dig> additional variants under the control of the e <dig> promoter that do not contain exon  <dig>  therefore, the labeling in the deep laminae of the spinal cord by the tau/gfp reporter may represent expression of those e <dig> promoter-driven variants other than mor- <dig> itself. on the other hand, there are three e <dig> promoter-driven transcripts  that contain exon  <dig> and that can generate the same identical protein as mor- <dig>  thus, more labeling by the exon  <dig> antibody and less labeling by tau/gfp reporter in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions of the hippocampus may indicate that e4-li seen in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions reveal transcripts driven by the e <dig> promoter. this possibility is supported by the expression of the tau/lacz reporter driven by the transgenic e <dig> promoter in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions . however, this possibility remains speculative.

we also observed the expression of tau/lacz reporter in various cns regions . previously, we examined the distribution of exon 11-like immunoreactivity  in the mouse cns with a polyclonal antibody generated against a 22-residue peptide from exon  <dig>  <cit> . e11-li was observed primarily in the olfactory tubercle, striatum, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. tau/lacz reporter was also expressed in these regions. however, the e11-li had a very limited distribution in the cns in contrast to the wide distribution of tau/lacz reporter . there are several potential explanations. first, the tau/lacz reporter measures the activity of the transgenic e <dig> promoter, and resembles the expression of all e11-associated variants. since several e11-associated transcripts  can produce the same mor- <dig> protein lacking the exon  <dig> epitope, the exon  <dig> antibody was incapable of detecting these proteins. therefore, the tau/lacz reporter reflects a broader range of variants than those identified with only the exon  <dig> antibody. secondly, mismatches between the distributions of mrna and protein within the brain are not uncommon. mismatches have been observed for mu opioid receptors when comparing in situ hybridization, immunoreactivity and receptor binding between receptor mrna and protein expression  <cit> . we also observed some mismatches between the mrna and protein distribution of the e11-associated variants <cit> . one possible explanation is that receptor proteins may be synthesized in cell bodies from one region and then transported to their terminals located in the other region, whereas mrna is primarily localized in the cell body. the exon  <dig> antibody only detected the exon 11-associated proteins. if the exon  <dig> expressing proteins are transported away from the cell body, the antibody may only label the projection areas and not the cell bodies themselves. thirdly, these differences may be dependent upon different assay sensitivities. for example, x-gal staining might be more sensitive than the exon  <dig> immunohistochemistry. although tau/lacz reporter was anticipated to resemble e <dig> promoter activity, the complete distribution patterns of the endogenous e <dig> promoter activity at both mrna and protein levels have not been determined. however, a tau/lacz reporter in our exon <dig> knockin/knockout mice, in which the exon  <dig> coding and adjacent intron regions were replaced by an ires/tau/lacz/neo cassette through homologous recombination, displayed a distribution pattern very similar to that of the transgenic mice , further supporting the relevance of the current model.

although both tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters were widely distributed in various cns regions such as the piriform cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampal formation, thalamus, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, brainstem, purkinje cells and spinal cord, the distribution patterns of the two reporters differed in certain brain regions. for example, in the lateral parietal association cortex, tau/gfp reporter was expressed over multiple layers, while tau/lacz reporter was distributed in the middle layers only . in the hippocampal formation, tau/lacz activity was observed in the pyramidal cell layer throughout the ca <dig>  ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions, but tau/gfp activity was limited to the ca <dig> region . in the pars reticulate of the substantia nigra, the tau/lacz reporter appeared to be expressed in more neurons than did the tau/gfp reporter . these differential distributions provided in vivo evidence that the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters were differentially regulated in these cns regions.

interestingly, both tau/lacz and tau/gfp expression were quite prominent in purkinje cells and in the medial cerebellar nucleus, suggesting potential roles in motor actions . although a number of studies using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry failed to detect mor- <dig> expression in the cerebellum  <cit> , others observed mor- <dig> expression at both the mrna and protein levels  <cit> . for example, mrkusich et al. demonstrated abundant expression of both mor- <dig> mrna by fluorescent in situ hybridization and mor- <dig> protein by immunostaining with an exon 4-specific antibody in the rat cerebellum, particularly within purkinje cells and the deep cerebellar nuclei <cit> . using an in situ hybridization approach with a 35s-labeled  <dig> bp mor- <dig> probe, kaufman et al. showed moderate labeling in the medial and interposed deep nuclei in the mouse cerebellum <cit> . mor-1c, mor-1f and mor- <dig> mrnas were also detected in the mouse cerebellum by a rt-pcr approach  <cit> . moreover, mmor-1b4-like immunoreactivity was densely distributed in purkinje cells and the deep cerebellar nuclei <cit> . the expression of tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters in purkinje cells and medial cerebellar nucleus of our transgenic mice supported these positive findings.

in the spinal cord, both reporters were mostly distributed in the lumbar and sacral segments as compared with the cervical and thoracic segments. in the lumber segments, the expression of tau/gfp reporter appeared higher than that of tau/lacz reporter throughout all laminae . tau/gfp reporter was intensively expressed in the superficial laminae, and also scattered in a number of motor neurons in the deeper laminae . tau/lacz reporter was also mainly distributed in laminae i-ii, but had less intense labeling than tau/gfp reporter. tau/lacz was also observed in the larger motor neurons in the deeper laminae .

CONCLUSIONS
we have established a transgenic mouse line using a ~ <dig> kb transgenic construct in which the  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter region and the  <dig>  kb e <dig> promoter region control expression of the tau/lacz and tau/gfp reporters, respectively. this transgenic model permits studying the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters of the mouse oprm gene in vivo. temporal and spatial expressions of these reporters were similar to that of the endogenous promoters, suggesting the reasonable relevance of this transgenic model. although the e <dig> transcript was expressed at lower levels, as determined by rt-pcr, differential expression of e <dig> and e <dig> promoters during embryonic development and in various cns regions provides another mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the oprm gene. we anticipate that these transgenic mice will also offer a useful in vivo model to study the e <dig> and e <dig> promoters under different physiological and pathological conditions such as chronic opioid treatment and chronic pain models.
