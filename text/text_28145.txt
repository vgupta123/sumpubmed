BACKGROUND
both gemcitabine and arac are widely used in the treatment of a variety of cancers and both display wide individual variation in drug response  <cit> . pharmacogenomic studies have the potential to provide insight into mechanisms underlying individual variation in response to these two drugs  <cit> . many previous pharmacogenetic studies focused on the bioactivation and metabolism pathways for cytidine analogues  <cit> . for example, snps in genes encoding ribonucleotide reductase  and cytidine deaminase  were found to be associated with gemcitabine chemosensitivity in the nci- <dig> cell lines or with active gemcitabine metabolite plasma levels  <cit> . those findings provided the initial evidence that genetic variation might contribute to variation in cytidine analogue response. we previously used the “human variation panel”, a genomic data-rich lymphoblastoid cell line model system, to identify markers that might contribute to variation in response to these two cytidine analogues  <cit> . these cell lines have proven to be a powerful tool for both the identification of pharmacogenomic hypotheses and for the pursuit of hypotheses from the clinical gwas  <cit> . however, the earlier studies were performed with less dense snp coverage, in the present study, we expanded our previous 550 k snp data to include a total of  <dig>  million snps obtained with both illumina and affymetrix snp genotyping platforms in an attempt to identify additional genes or snps that might be associated with drug response. to follow-up the candidates, we performed functional studies using tumor cell lines in an attempt to determine possible underlying mechanisms that might help us to better understand mechanisms of action for these two drugs. the results of the comprehensive series of experiments described subsequently resulted in the identification of several novel snps and genes associated with gemcitabine and arac drug response in these cell lines. these results could be tested in future clinical studies to determine whether they might help predict response to gemcitabine and arac.

methods
cell lines
one hundred and seventy four human lymphoblastoid cell lines from  <dig> caucasian-american ,  <dig> african-american  and  <dig> han chinese-american   subjects were purchased from the coriell cell repository . all of these cell lines had been obtained and anonymized by the national institute of general medical sciences prior to deposit, and all subjects had provided written consent for the use of their dna and cells for experimental purposes. human su <dig> pancreatic cancer cell lines were a gift from dr. daniel d. billadeau . human breast cancer mda-mb- <dig> and leukemia bdcm and thp- <dig> cell lines were purchased from the american type culture collection   and were cultured in dmem with 1% l-glutamine  supplemented with 10% fbs . other cell lines were maintained in rpmi medium  <dig> with 1% l-glutamine  supplemented with 10% fbs .

drugs and cell proliferation assays
gemcitabine was provided by eli lilly . arac was purchased from sigma-aldrich . cytotoxicity assays with the lymphoblastoid and tumor cell lines were performed with the celltiter 96® aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay  as previously described  <cit> . ic <dig> values were calculated using a three or four parameter logistic model with the r package “drc” , as described previously  <cit> .

snp genotyping
in order to validate the imputation results, six top imputed snps  were selected for genotyping using applied biosystems taqman technology . one snp  was not genotyped because the assay failed functional test, and four of the remaining five snps were successfully genotyped. among these four snps, rs <dig> was a pre-designed assay, while the remaining three snps  were customized assays designed with custom taqman® assay design tool . primer and probe sequences for these assays are available upon request. pcr protocols were followed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for the 384-well format. pcr amplifications were performed using applied biosystems® taqman® genotyping master mix with an applied biosystems® veriti® 384-well thermal cycler , and pcr products were analyzed on an applied biosystems 7900ht  <cit> .

transient transfection and rna interference
specific sigenome sirna smartpool® reagents against a given gene, as well as a negative control, sigenome non-targeting sirna pool # <dig>  were purchased from dharmacon inc. . human pancreatic cancer su <dig> and breast cancer mda-mb- <dig> cell lines were used to perform the sirna knockdown studies. the lipofectamine rnaimax transfection reagent  was used for sirna reverse or forward transfection. specifically, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and were mixed with sirna-complex consisting of 20– <dig> nm of specific sigenome sirna smartpool or non-targeting negative control  and the lipofectamine rnaimax transfection reagent. the human leukemia cell lines, bdcm and thp- <dig>  were transfected with electroporation using the nucleofector system with  <dig> nm of specific or negative sirna .

quantitative reverse transcription-pcr 
total rna was isolated from cultured cells with the qiagen rneasy kit , followed by qrt-pcr performed with the 1-step, brilliant sybr green qrt-pcr master mix kit . specifically, primers purchased from qiagen were used to perform qrt-pcr with the stratagene mx3005p™ real-time pcr detection system . all experiments were performed in triplicate with β-actin as an internal control. reverse transcribed universal human reference rna  was used to generate a standard curve. control reactions lacked rna template.

caspase-3/ <dig> activity assay
caspase-3/ <dig> activity was measured with the caspase-glo®3/ <dig> assay kit . specifically, sirna-transfected cells  were seeded overnight into 96-well plates at a density of  <dig>  cells per well and were then treated with dmso or increasing concentrations of gemcitabine or arac for 48 h. 100 μl of caspase-glo® 3/ <dig> reagent was then added to each well, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by the measurement of luminescence with a safire <dig> microplate reader . the luminescent signal was proportional to caspase-3/ <dig> activity and was used as a measure of apoptosis. wells containing only culture medium were used as controls.

cancer cignal finder 10-pathway reporter array
the cignal finder arrays consist of  <dig> dual-luciferase reporter assays for ten cancer-related signaling pathways. each reporter construct is a mixture of an inducible transcription factor  responsive firefly luciferase reporter and a constitutively expressing renilla construct at a ratio of 40: <dig>  respectively . specifically, cells were reversely transfected with  <dig> nm of specific sirna pools in 96-well plates using lipofectamine rnaimax reagent  for 24 h, followed by transfection with 100 ng of each reporter construct. forty-eight h after the transfection, a dual-luciferase assay was performed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system  in a safire <dig> microplate reader .

electrophoresis mobility shift assays 
based on the genome-wide association results, we performed emsa for snps in potential regulatory regions of genes that were associated with the measured phenotypes. specifically, double-strand probes were 5′-end labeled with biotin and electrophoresis was performed with 5% acrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. competition experiments were performed with excess non-labeled probe.

genome-wide gene expression and snp analysis
expression array data were obtained for all  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell lines  as previously described  <cit> . illumina humanhap550k and 510s beadchips, which assayed  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps, respectively, were used to obtain genome-wide snp data for these lcls  <cit> . genotyping was performed in the genotype shared resource  at the mayo clinic, rochester, mn. we also obtained publicly available affymetrix snp array  <dig>  chip snp data which involved  <dig>  snps unique to the affymetrix snp array for the same cell lines. after quality control , snps with call rates < <dig> , hardy-weinberg equilibrium  p values <  <dig> , or mafs <5% were excluded, as were dna samples with call rates < <dig> . a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps that passed qc were used to perform the association studies.

imputation analysis
snps not genotyped were imputed across a region 200 kb up or downstream of the selected genes harboring or close to the snps associated with drug response in the lcls. imputation was performed using beagle   <cit>  with the 11/23/ <dig> release of the  <dig> genomes project as a reference population  <cit> . imputed snps with a dosage r <dig> quality measure of less than  <dig> , and snps with maf < <dig>  were not included in the analysis. four of the imputed snps were genotyped for validation, the average squared difference between the count of the same allele in the imputed and genotyped version of these snps was computed to measure the concordance of the imputed genotype with actual genotype, a smaller difference indicating greater concordance.

statistical methods
partial pearson correlations were used to quantify the association between: snps and mrna expression; snps and ic50; and mrna expression and ic <dig>  ic <dig> was transformed to remove skewness using a log transformation for gemcitabine and van der waerden rank transformation for arac. the adjustment variables in the partial correlation were race and gender if snps were not involved; or race, gender and five eigenvectors controlling for population stratification as described previously  <cit> . these partial correlations were tested using a wald test, false discovery q-values  <cit>  were also computed for each test.

RESULTS
genome-wide snp vs. drug cytotoxicity association study and imputation analysis
previously, we had performed gwas using only the 550 k snp data set for this cell line system  <cit> . in the current study, we expand the snps studies to include additional illumina snps as well as publically available snp data obtained with affymetrix  <dig>  snp data for the same cell lines to identify additional novel potential pharmacogenomic biomarkers. as a result, we performed an analysis for the association of  <dig> , <dig> snps with ic <dig> values for gemcitabine and arac . the most significant snp for gemcitabine was rs <dig> with a p value  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , while the most significant snp for arac was rs <dig> with a p value  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  . fourteen snps for gemcitabine and  <dig> for arac had p values <10- <dig>  and  <dig> snps for gemcitabine and  <dig> snps for arac had p values <10- <dig>  respectively. one hundred and twenty six snps with p < 10- <dig> were common to both drugs . to explore ungenotyped snps that might be functional, we imputed snps surrounding the selected genes  harboring or close to the most significant snp loci using  <dig> genomes data as a reference . besides the “observed snps” on the genotyping platforms, there were  <dig> imputed snps for gemcitabine and  <dig> for arac, respectively, that were also associated with drug response ic <dig> values  . in order to determine the accuracy of imputation, we selected  <dig> imputed snps  that were among the top two snps from each gene region associated with drug response ic50s  to genotype using taqman assay. four snps  were successfully genotyped. the average squared difference between the count of the same allele in the imputed and genotyped version of these  <dig> snps was low ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  indicating that the concordance was high .

“integrated analyses” of snp loci, basal expression and drug cytotoxicity
we also performed integrated analyses of snps, expression array and cytotoxicity data  <cit> . to do that, we began with snps that had p values <10- <dig>  we selected a less stringent p value cutoff to include as many potential candidates as possible for follow-up functional genomic studies. next, we tested expression probe sets that were associated with these snps, followed by association of those expression probe sets with drug ic <dig> values, ie we performed an “integrated analysis”. in these analyses, we used snp loci, defined as a region that contained at least  <dig> snps with p < 10- <dig> or  <dig> snp with p < 10- <dig>  plus  <dig> additional snps with p < 10- <dig> within +/−100 kb surrounding the most significant snps. all of the snps within each of those loci are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  which includes genotyped as well as imputed snps. we identified  <dig> loci containing  <dig> snps for gemcitabine and  <dig> loci with  <dig> snps for arac that were associated with ic <dig> values for these two drugs, respectively . four loci containing  <dig> genes – hla-dra, znf <dig>  mass <dig>  and pld <dig> – were common to both drugs .

each locus contained at least  <dig> snps within 50 kb with p values <10- <dig>  r values represent correlation coefficients for the association. number of snps indicates the number of significantly associated snps in the locus. rsid indicates the most significant snp associated with drug cytotoxicity in the locus. * = common to both gemcitabine and arac.

the integrated analyses identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> loci that were associated with gemcitabine ic <dig> values and the expression of  <dig> genes represented by  <dig> probesets. those  <dig> probesets were also associated with gemcitabine ic <dig> values . the integrated analyses also identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> loci that were associated with arac ic <dig> values and the expression of  <dig> genes  . for gemcitabine,  <dig> snps were within cis-regulatory regions for pigb or c3orf <dig>  no cis- regulation between snp and gene expression was identified for arac. of interest, snps in pigb were associated with the expression of that gene  as well as the expression of fkbp <dig> , a gene that we previously reported to play an important role in response to gemcitabine and arac as well as many other chemotherapeutic agents including gemcitabine and arac  <cit> . we next moved to further analyses of candidate genes identified during the integrated analysis.

“integrated analyses” with the top expression probe sets that were associated with snps within loci with gemcitabine ic <dig> , except for c3orf <dig> . eighteen unique probe sets, representing  <dig> annotated genes that were associated with  <dig> snps within  <dig> loci and were significantly correlated with gemcitabine ic <dig> values are listed.  “integrated analyses” for arac. eleven unique probe sets, representing  <dig> annotated genes that were associated with  <dig> snps within  <dig> loci and were significantly correlated with arac ic <dig> values are listed. r values represent correlation coefficients for each association.

follow-up functional validation of candidate genes in cancer cells
since the regulation of gene expression is tissue specific  <cit> , we wanted to functionally validate in cancer cell lines candidate genes selected based on our analysis performed with lcls. the tumor cell lines that we selected were based on the expression of the genes of interest and on the clinical uses of these two drugs. gemcitabine is used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer but it is also used to treat other solid tumors such as breast cancer, while arac is first-line therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia . therefore, we selected one human pancreatic cancer cell line, su <dig>  one breast cancer cell line, mda-mb- <dig> and two leukemia cell lines, bdcm and thp <dig>  to functionally characterize the genes of interest. twenty-six genes were selected based on a series of criteria including association p value, snp locus, whether the gene was expressed in lcls and the biological function of the genes . to determine the functional impact of those genes, we used specific sirna pools to knockdown the  <dig> candidate genes, followed by qrt-pcr and mts cytotoxicity assay. eleven genes showed an effect on gemcitabine cytotoxicity,  <dig> on arac and  <dig> were common to both drugs. knockdown of pigb, zadh <dig>  psme <dig>  dok <dig>  tgfbi, and hla-dra in both su <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells significantly desensitized the cells to gemcitabine , consistent with the association study results. knockdown of c4orf <dig>  tusc <dig>  lnx <dig>  ris <dig>  and smc <dig> and hla-dra in both su <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells significantly desensitized the cells to arac . finally, knockdown of hla-dra in thp- <dig> leukemia cells, lnx <dig> in bdcm cells, and smc <dig> and ris <dig> in both thp <dig> and bdcm cells also desensitized the cells to arac, results that were also consistent with our association results .

the table lists the top  <dig> candidate genes selected for sirna screening for both gemcitabine and arac, with mts assay results as well as qrt-pcr assay results when appropriate.

a total of  <dig> genes were selected for sirna screening, with  <dig> genes for gemcitabine,  <dig> for arac, and  <dig> for both. for the validation assays with mts and qrt-pcr, “yes” indicates that knockdown of the gene altered drug cytotoxicity, while “no” indicates no alteration. “np” indicates not performed. the genes that are bolded were functionally validated.

we next wanted to determine whether the cytotoxic effects of those genes might involve apoptosis. therefore, we performed caspase-3/ <dig> activity assays after knockdown of the candidate genes in su <dig> cells. as shown in figure 5a and 5b, down-regulation of pigb, dok <dig>  tgfbi, zadh <dig>  psme <dig>  and hla-dra in su <dig> cells significantly decreased caspase-3/ <dig> activity after treatment with gemcitabine as compared with negative control sirna-treated cells. similar results were also observed for arac treatment following sirna knockdown of tusc <dig>  c14orf <dig>  and hla-dra. however, knockdown of lnx <dig>  ris <dig>  and smc <dig> did not alter the cellular caspase-3/ <dig> activity , suggesting that a different mechanism was involved.

functional characterization of  <dig> genes using the cancer-related cignal reporter array .

transcription factors for each signal pathway are listed in parenthesis. “increase” means at least a 2-fold increase of luciferase activity in cells treated with specific sirna compared with cells treated with negative control sirna; while “decrease” indicates at least a 50% decrease of luciferase activity in control cells. “no” means no alteration in luciferase activity after sirna knockdown.

finally, we used the cancer cignal finder array  that consists of  <dig> dual-luciferase reporter gene assays to determine whether our candidate genes might affect any of the  <dig> cancer-related signaling pathways in su <dig> cells by measuring changes in transcriptional activities of  <dig> key transcription factors  after knockdown of each candidate gene. we observed changes in transcriptional activity of several tfs after knockdown of specific genes in su <dig> cells, suggesting that these genes might be involved in the regulation of a particular cancer-related signaling pathway or pathways that might contribute to resistance to gemcitabine and arac . for example, knockdown of pigb resulted in a decrease in transcriptional activity of elk-1/srf, ap <dig>  nfκb, and myc/max in su <dig> cells, indicating a down-regulation of these signaling pathways. knockdown of dok <dig> dramatically decreased the transcription activities of both nfκb and ap <dig> in the nfκb and mapk/jnk pathways, while the activity of the transcription factor myc/max that is involved in the c-myc pathway was increased significantly after zadh <dig> knockdown. however, we did not observe any significant changes after smc <dig> knockdown.

functional characterization of pigb snps
when we performed integrated analysis among snps, gene expression and gemcitabine cytotoxicity, we found that the only cis-regulated snps mapped to pigb. knockdown of pigb resulted in desensitization of cancer cells to gemcitabine. pigb contained  <dig> snps that were associated both with gemcitabine response  and with its own gene expression  . pigb expression was also significantly correlated with gemcitabine cytotoxicity . we also determined ld patterns for those  <dig> snps using hapmap data for each ethnic group. as shown in figure 7a, ld patterns differed among the three ethnic groups. in both chb/jpt and ceph groups, those  <dig> snps were in tight ld, while there was not significant linkage among the snps in the yri population. the top  <dig> snps in pigb, including rs <dig>  a nonsynonymous coding snp  in exon  <dig>  rs <dig> in the 5′-utr, and rs <dig> in the 5′ flanking region  were selected for further functional characterization.
pigb 
that were associated with gemcitabine cytotoxicity and its expression in lcls by integrated analysis

r values represent correlation coefficients for associations. we performed integrated analysis among the snps and mrna expression of the pigb gene as well as gemcitabine cytotoxicity. the only cis-associated snps with pigb gene expression were listed.

we first determined pigb expression levels in  <dig> lcls selected on the basis of genotypes for those  <dig> snps using both qrt-pcr assay and expression array data to confirm the association between the snps and pigb expression. cells carrying the variant alleles showed significantly lower expression levels than did wt cells . we next determined the functional impact of these  <dig> snps. as shown in figure 7c, overexpression of a construct for the pigb coding snp  in su <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells did not alter either mrna or protein levels, nor did it have an effect on gemcitabine cytotoxicity. we then determined whether the two snps in regulatory regions, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  might have functional impact. we performed electrophoresis mobility shift assays  for these two snps to determine whether there might be differences in binding patterns for possible transcription factors. interestingly, the results from emsa showed that dna-protein binding was significantly increased for the probe containing the variant sequences for these two snps in both su <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells . these results suggested that these two snps might alter the binding of transcription factors and, as a result, affect pigb expression level.

discussion
we previously performed a genome wide snp association study with 550 k snps obtained with illumina humanhap <dig> beadchips for the same cell lines to identify common polymorphisms that might influence both gene expression and response to these two drugs  <cit> . in the present study, we expanded the number of snps from 550 k to include over  <dig>  million snps and selected candidate genes for functional follow-up studies based on snp loci. this dense snp coverage made it possible to identify many more candidates for functional follow-ups. that enabled us to take a different approach by focusing on “snp loci” instead of single snps. the results listed in table  <dig> show that  <dig> of  <dig> candidate genes selected in this fashion were validated functionally, while only two other genes from the previous 550 k studies were functionally validated  <cit> .

we also tested the concordance of the results generated with 550 k and  <dig>  million snps if we had used the same strategy as we did in the current study, i.e. using snp loci to perform the association studies. the majority of top snp peaks from the 550 k snp data for both drugs displayed less significant snps for each locus as compared to the  <dig>  million snp data . these observations illustrate the advantage of the present selection strategy for candidate identification, as well as the advantage of using denser snp coverage.

of the  <dig> candidate genes that we identified for further sirna screening followed by mts assay, eleven candidate genes, including pigb, tgfbi, dok <dig>  psme <dig>  zadh <dig>  tusc <dig>  c14orf <dig>  smc <dig>  lnx <dig>  ris <dig>  and hla-dra, showed a significant effect on response to gemcitabine and/or arac in su <dig> and/or mda-mb <dig> cells. to identify potential pathways with which these genes might be involved, we used a dual luciferase reporter gene assay to assess the impact of these genes on  <dig> major cancer-related signaling pathways. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  except for the smc <dig> gene, knockdown of the other  <dig> genes in su <dig> cells significantly altered activities, based on the luciferase assay for at least one of the  <dig> cancer related signaling pathways. genes such as tgfb <dig> showed changes for the most pathways. while tgfb <dig> has been well studied, genes such as c14orf <dig>  an unknown gene, also showed increased activity in  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways.

we also observed that the activities of the elk-1/srf, ap <dig>  nfκb, and myc/max pathways were significantly decreased in su <dig> cells when pigb was down-regulated by a specific sirna. pigb, a gene of the phosphatidylinositol glycan  class b, encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor that is a membrane attachment structure for many proteins, including membranous enzymes, receptors, differentiation antigens, and other biologically active proteins  <cit> . gpi anchoring is essential for the expression of many of those proteins in either biological processes or cancer progression  <cit> . the pigb protein is a gpi mannosyltransferase iii and is required for the transfer of the third mannose into the core structure of the gpi anchor  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that other pig class members, such as pigu and pigt, are oncogenes in either human bladder cancer or breast cancer, respectively  <cit> . our findings indicate that pigb is involved in sensitizing cancer cells to both gemcitabine and arac, suggesting a possible role in oncogenic pathways as well as chemoresistance. the  <dig> pigb snps were also associated with the expression of fkbp <dig>  a gene that we previously reported to be important for gemcitabine and arac response  <cit> . furthermore, pigb expression itself is also correlated with fkbp <dig> gene expression. although down regulation of pigb altered fkbp <dig> mrna level, overexpression of fkbp <dig> in pigb stable knockdown cell lines did not change response to gemcitabine or arac . these observations indicate that pigb influences the cytotoxicity of the two cytidine analogues through mechanisms that differ from fkbp <dig>  in spite of the correlation of their expression levels observed in the lcls. the exact mechanisms by which pigb affects gemcitabine and arac cytotoxicity need to be explored in the course of future experiments.

in addition to the characterization of candidate genes, we also focused on snps in the pigb gene that showed cis-regulation of pigb expression. snps in regulatory regions can influence drug response through an influence on gene expression. during our analysis, we found that most snp associations with expression were through trans-regulation. the reason that we focused on snps in pigb is because those snps displayed cis-regulations of pigb and knockdown of pigb showed an effect on cytotoxicity. the emsa results also demonstrated “shifts” for the variant snp sequences , suggesting that pigb gene expression might be regulated through binding to those transcription factors.

previous studies demonstrated that one mechanism by which snps might influence drug cytotoxicity is through transcription regulation in either a cis- or trans-manner  <cit> . in this analysis, we found snps that could both have cis or trans relationship. in addition to the snps that cis regulate pigb, we also found that snps close to c3orf <dig> were not only cis-associated with its own gene expression, but also trans-correlated with the expression of zadh <dig> which was confirmed to affect drug response of gemcitabine in our functional validation study. how those genetic variations located in the upstream of c3orf <dig> affect the expression of zadh <dig> gene in a trans- manner remains unknown. one mechanism might be that those snps nearby c3orf <dig> could alter dna sequence binding to transcription factors , microrna, or other long non-coding rna , thus affect transcriptional regulation of their target genes including zadh <dig> gene, which could in turn, affect gemcitabine response.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study performed with lcls followed by functional characterization has enhanced our understanding of the action of gemcitabine and arac in the therapy of cancer. although there are limitations associated with the use of lcls  <cit> , this system has proven to be extremely useful, both to generate pharmacogenomic hypothesis and to test pharmacogenomic signals identified during the clinical gwas  <cit> . future studies using patient samples will now be required to confirm the candidates identified during this study.
