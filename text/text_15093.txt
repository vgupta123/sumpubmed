BACKGROUND
γ-aminobutyric acid , acting via gaba type a receptors , mediates the bulk of rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult mammalian central nervous system. gabaa-rs are pentameric chloride channels assembled from  <dig> different subunits, α 1– <dig>  β1– <dig>  γ1– <dig>  δ, ε, π, ρ1– <dig>  and θ <cit> . most native receptors are formed from 2α, 2β, and 1γ or 1δ subunits  <cit> .

the β <dig> subunit is especially interesting because this subunit has been suggested to be a candidate gene for neurodevelopmental disorders such as angelman syndrome  <cit>  and autism spectrum disorder  <cit> . β <dig> containing gabaa-r isoforms also are a crucial site of action for intravenous anesthetics  <cit>  and ethanol  <cit> , and an important receptor involved in developmental processes  <cit> .

the β <dig> subunit is widely expressed in the developing rodent brain and spinal cord  <cit> . in the adult rodent, highest levels of β <dig> expression are restricted to hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb striatum, and lower levels are observed in numerous other brain regions  <cit> .

to elucidate the role of the β <dig> subunit in physiology and pathophysiology, we previously created and characterized a mouse line that harbored a null allele of the β <dig> subunit  <cit> . these global knockout mice ubiquitously lacked the β <dig> protein throughout development in the whole animal. high levels of neonatal mortality  <cit>  and compensatory adaptations were observed  <cit>  that limited the utility of the model. to overcome the shortcomings of the global β <dig> knockout model, we have now successfully created a mutant β <dig> mouse line that can be used to create tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated β <dig> knockouts. here, the production and characterization of the conditional knockout model, and the use of this model to gain new insight into the role of β <dig> containing gabaa-rs in development, behavior, body weight control, and anesthetic action is described.

RESULTS
gene targeting
a gene targeting construct  was introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells to modify the β <dig> locus. a total of  <dig> embryonic stem cell clones were screened by southern blot analysis to identify correctly targeted clones. eight clones were correctly targeted. gene targeting at the β <dig> locus created an ecorv restriction fragment length polymorphism; a 3' probe that was external to the targeting construct hybridized to a  <dig>  kb fragment from the wild type allele  and to a  <dig>  kb fragment from a correctly targeted allele . retention of the 5' loxp site was verified by the presence of a  <dig>  kb bglii restriction fragment that hybridized to the β3– <dig> probe. correctly targeted clones were analyzed with several additional enzymes and probes and all results were consistent with targeting at the β <dig> locus .

of  <dig> correctly targeted clones injected into mouse blastocysts, chimeric mice from  <dig> clones transmitted the targeted β <dig> allele to the f <dig> generation following mating to c57bl/6j females. the results presented here were derived from clone 77s <dig> 

the unrecombined floxed β <dig> gene functioned normally
heterozygous  f <dig> mice were mated to an actin-flpe transgenic deleter mouse line  <cit>  to remove the neo gene by flpe-mediated site-specific recombination. this produced mice that were heterozygous for the wild type and the floxed  β <dig> alleles and lacked the neo gene . these mice were interbred to produce wild type , heterozygous  and homozygous floxed  mice. β3f/f mice were born at the expected frequency, were viable, did not have cleft palate, and were overtly indistinguishable from control littermates. this is in direct contrast to mice with global disruption of the β <dig> gene  <cit> ; most of these mice died as neonates, had cleft palate, and those that survived had multiple behavioral abnormalities. thus, the floxed β <dig> gene did not grossly have an adverse effect on function of the β <dig> gene.

the recombined β <dig> gene is a null allele
β3+/f mice were subsequently crossed to an actin-cre transgenic deleter mouse line  <cit>  to recombine the floxed β <dig> allele and delete exon  <dig>  deletion of this  <dig> basepair exon was predicted to create a frameshift mutation and introduce a premature stop codon. the predicted product of the mutant β <dig> allele contains amino acids 1– <dig> of β <dig> followed by a novel  <dig> amino acid sequence. this product, which is devoid of the amino terminal  <dig> amino acids , should produce a nonfunctional product as all four of the putative transmembrane domains would be absent. mice that were heterozygous for the cre recombined allele  were interbred to produce β3+/+, β3+/f, and homozygous recombined  mice. while the frequency of β3f/f offspring was close to that expected by mendelian genetics ,  <dig> of the  <dig> offspring died  <dig> days postnatally and the survivor at day  <dig>  fifty-four percent  of these mice had cleft palate. these results were consistent with the phenotype of global β <dig> knockouts that were produced by traditional gene targeting  <cit> . thus, the recombined β <dig> allele functioned as a null allele following cre-mediated recombination.

production and analysis of pan-neuronal β <dig> knockout mice
floxed β <dig> mice were also crossed to a synapsin i-cre  transgenic mouse line  <cit>  to produce neuron-specific conditional knockout mice. this cre expressing mouse line induces widespread recombination exclusively in neurons starting at embryonic day  <dig> .

to investigate the effects of embryonic, pan-neuronal knockout of β <dig>  pups were collected before birth  from β3f/f, cre- by β3f/f, cre+ mating pairs for genotype analysis. this study revealed that β3f/f, cre+ pups were present at a frequency that was similar to β3f/f, cre- pups . visual analysis of the palates of a subset of these mice revealed that  <dig> of  <dig> β3f/f, cre+ pups examined in detail had cleft palate. thus, we conclude that pan-neuronal knockout of β <dig> is compatible with in utero survival and normal palate development.

to investigate the effects of pan-neuronal knockout of β <dig> on postnatal survival and development, a genotypic analysis of weanling mice derived from β3f/f, cre- by β3f/f, cre+ mating pairs was performed. this study revealed that only ~28%  of the mice genotyped were cre+, in contrast to the ~72%  that were cre-. this differs from the expected 1: <dig> ratio. these results suggest that ~61% of the β3f/f, cre+ mice died before weaning. many of the cre+ pups died within a few days of birth. thus, we conclude that pan-neuronal inactivation of β <dig> by syn-cre appears to result in a variably penetrant, non-cleft palate, neonatal lethality.

gross behavior of the β3f/f, cre+ mice that survived beyond weaning were observed while in their home cage and during handling. the cre+ mice were overtly indistinguishable from control, cre- littermates. unlike the global β <dig> knockouts  <cit> , these conditional β <dig> knockouts did not display foot clasping behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, or tremors. in addition, both sexes of β3f/f, cre+ mice were found to be fertile and females displayed normal maternal care.

to examine the degree to which the β <dig> gene product was reduced in various brain regions of the knockouts, western blot analysis of hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum was performed using a β <dig> specific antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  syn-cre mediated knockout of β <dig> resulted in a dramatic reduction of β <dig> protein in all brain regions examined.

pan-neuronal knockout mice were tested for sensitivity to the intravenous anesthetic etomidate and ethanol using the standard loss of the righting reflex  assay. for etomidate, the analysis revealed a significant effect of gender . therefore, males and females were analyzed separately. this gender difference was also seen when etomidate was administered intravenously . as shown in figure 3a, both male and female knockouts were less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of etomidate as evidenced by the reduced duration of the lorr as compared to controls . there was no effect of gender on ethanol-induced sleep time. therefore, data were collapsed and analyzed together. ethanol-induced sleep time did not differ between genotypes .

production and analysis of forebrain selective β <dig> knockout mice
to produce a β <dig> knockout that is restricted only to postnatal forebrain neurons, the floxed β <dig> mice were crossed with an α camkii-cre mouse line  <cit> . this mouse line has been reported to restrict recombination specifically to pyramidal neurons of the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus starting ~ <dig> weeks after birth  <cit> . in a complementary report, a slightly broader pattern of recombination, deemed as "forebrain selective", that included the amygdala and cortex in addition to the hippocampus was described  <cit> .

mating of β3f/f, cre- by β3f/f, cre+ produced normal sized litters with no apparent neonatal mortality. however, some cre+ mice died between  <dig> and  <dig> days after birth, a time frame that coincides with expression of cre recombinase from the α camkii-cre mouse line  <cit> . general observation of these mice discovered no abnormal phenotype, but interestingly, of  <dig> cre+ mice that died prematurely, 72% were male. at  <dig> weeks old, genotype analysis of surviving offspring revealed a ~30% reduction in cre+ mice  compared to cre- . some of the cre+ mice that survived beyond weaning exhibited abnormal neurological behavior. these mice tended to be hyperresponsive to human contact, and at times appeared to be 'frozen' in their home cage, possibly having absence seizure-like behavior. this phenotype appeared to worsen with age and is similar to that observed in global β <dig> knockout mice  <cit> .

to examine the impact of α camkii-cre mediated recombination on the β <dig> gene product, western blot analysis was conducted on hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and hypothalamus using a β <dig> specific antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  β <dig> protein was dramatically reduced in hippocampus and was nearly completely ablated in cortex of cre+ mice compared to cre- controls. in contrast, the amount of β <dig> in cerebellum was not significantly reduced by the α camkii-cre transgene. cortex from  <dig> week old mice was also examined for the amount of β <dig>  this analysis revealed a ~50% reduction in β <dig> in forebrain selective knockout mice compared to controls .

reproductive fitness of β3f/f, cre+ mice was tested by crossing to wild type mates. both males and females were reproductively impaired. two of six females that were test-mated consistently produced and cared for normal sized litters. the four other females either did not produce any offspring or produced litters infrequently and usually failed to care for pups. male β3f/f, cre+ mice were test mated to superovulated females. none of the four cre+ mice produced copulation plugs, in contrast to  <dig> of  <dig> cre- mice that were tested for comparison. in addition, these four cre+ mice were housed with β3f/+, cre- females for 2– <dig>  months. one male sired a seemingly normal number of litters during that time , whereas the other three males each only sired a single litter. thus, male reproductive fitness also seemed to be compromised.

during the course of these studies, we also noticed that some, but not all, β3f/f, cre+ became obese in adulthood. to quantify this, the body weights of mice from 4– <dig> weeks of age were measured. as shown in figure 5a, b, cre+ mice attained significantly greater body weights by ~8– <dig> weeks of age compared to cre- controls. furthermore, analysis of the distribution of body weights revealed that there was considerable variability in the body weights of the cre+ mice. for example, at  <dig> weeks of age, while some cre+ animals had body weights that overlaped with controls, others had body weights that were  <dig> × average control values .

to find out if the obese mice also had a greater food intake, food consumption between knockout males and controls was compared. by  <dig> weeks of age, all surviving cre+ males were obese . average food consumption assessed over the course of  <dig> days was greater in knockouts compared to controls .

the forebrain selective knockout mice were also tested for sensitivity to etomidate and ethanol. no effect of gender was observed in either assay. as shown in figure 3c, knockouts were less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of etomidate compared to controls . in contrast, ethanol-induced sleep time did not differ between genotypes .

spontaneous locomotor activity testing revealed that forebrain selective knockout mice were more active than the cre- control mice as evidenced by the greater total activity of knockouts . when only the ambulatory component of the total activity measurement was isolated for separate comparison, there was a trend for knockouts to exhibit greater activity . during locomotor assessments mice were also closely observed for any indication of convulsive or absence-like behavior. no convulsive like behaviors were observed during testing, however one mouse was observed to have a convulsive seizure on a later date.

mice were tested for learning and memory using a passive avoidance assay. as shown in figure 6b, time to re-enter the dark side of the test apparatus was significantly increased by an aversive footshock . however, there was no effect of genotype or interaction of genotype with shock.

discussion
in this study a novel genetically engineered mouse line that was used to create gabaa-r β <dig> subunit conditional gene knockout mice was developed. this mouse line allowed further assessment of the involvement of the β <dig> gabaa-r subunit in formation of the palate, viability, body weight regulation, behavioral responses, and sedative/hypnotic drug sensitivity. results are summarized and compared to global β <dig> knockouts in table  <dig> 

*, results from present study.

cre recombinase mediated global knockout of β <dig> resulted in a high frequency  of cleft palate. this result agrees with studies that have reported a high frequency of cleft palate in mice that lack β <dig> due to traditional knockout of β <dig>  <cit>  or radiation-induced deletion of β <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ubiquitous expression of β <dig> alone on a β <dig> deficient background is sufficient to rescue this phenotype  <cit> .

while these global knockout/transgenic studies clearly define a role for β <dig> in normal palate formation, they do not distinguish between a neuronal and nonneuronal site of action. to dissect the contribution of neuronal vs nonneuronal β <dig> in palate formation, a conditional knockout mouse line which lacked β <dig> in most neurons was developed. in these pan-neuronal knockout mice, cre-mediated recombination was under the control of the rat synapsin i promoter. although the time course of cre-mediated inactivation of β <dig> in these mice was not examined in detail, this same syn-cre transgenic mouse line has been demonstrated to induce recombination primarily in neurons of the central nervous system starting at approximately embryonic day  <dig>   <cit> . cleft palate was not observed in this mouse line. these results lead us to suggest that neuronal β <dig> is not required for normal palate formation. this is consistent with the conclusions derived from a study where β <dig> was expressed only in neurons on a β <dig> knockout background  <cit> . that study demonstrated that neuronal expression of β <dig> was unable to rescue the animals from the clefting defect. together, these results lead us to suggest, but do not prove, that gabaergic signaling through β <dig> containing gabaa-rs in nonneuronal tissues is critical for normal development of the palate. an alternative explanation is that the time course and/or the extent of the genetic modification in the present study or in the study of hagiwara et. al  <cit>  was not sufficient to modulate palate formation. thus, an obligate neuronal requirement of β <dig> for normal palate formation cannot be excluded. continued investigation of β3's role in palate formation is warranted as the β <dig> locus has been implicated in human clefting defects  <cit> .

the results presented here also shed new light on the requirement of β <dig> for normal viability. global deletion of β <dig> resulted in a very high frequency of neonatal mortality, a result that is consistent with earlier studies of global β <dig> knockouts  <cit> . these results confirm that β <dig> is not required for survival in utero but is required for the transition to life immediately after birth. a high level  of perinatal mortality in pan-neuronal β <dig> knockouts was observed. the fact that pan-neuronal knockout did not result in cleft palate indicates that the perinatal mortality is not due to a defect in the palate that prevents feeding. the cause of death in these animals has not been determined. furthermore, forebrain selective deletion of β <dig>  rescues the mice from perinatal mortality, but it fails to ensure survival to adulthood. approximately 30% of forebrain selective β <dig> knockout mice die between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age. these results reveal that neuronal β <dig> is required beyond the perinatal period for normal viability. furthermore, these results confirm that the mortality is not due to aberrant embryonic development. instead, we conclude that there is a role for β <dig> in neuronal function that is required for survival.

those conditional β <dig> knockouts that survived to adulthood displayed a variety of abnormalities that varied considerably between animals. forebrain selective deletion of β <dig> also resulted in deficits in reproductive fitness, maternal care, and overt behavior. these phenotypes were similar to that observed in global β <dig> knockouts  <cit> .

hyperactivity is a common observation in global β <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . although forebrain selective β <dig> knockout mice were not observed to be nearly as hyperactive as global knockouts, they exhibited a statistically significant increase in their total activity, compared to control mice . as previous studies on global β <dig> knockout mice found them to exhibit high baseline velocities and ambulation  <cit> , these experiments were designed to likewise separate out the ambulatory component of the total activity measurements on the conditional knockouts. subsequently, there was a trend for ambulatory activity to be higher in forebrain selective β <dig> knockouts compared to cre- controls. this observation is evidence that locomotor components other than ambulation strongly impacted the resultant total activity measurements taken on the forebrain selective knockout mice. for example, the conditional knockouts, compared to controls, may have focused more on locomotor activities related to rearing, grooming or exploring small regions of the test apparatus rather than participating in higher ambulatory activity.

body weights were increased by forebrain selective knockout of the β <dig> subunit in both male and female mice . this may have been due in part, at least in the males, to an increase in food intake and occurred despite an increase in locomotor activity. it is of interest to note that the response in both males and females was variable, with only a subset of animals showing a clear increase in weight. this is most likely due to the fact that animals in this study were of a mixed background. given the large body of literature showing gaba or gabaa-r agonists to be stimulators of food intake  <cit> , the increase in body weight was somewhat unexpected. it may be that deletion of the β <dig> subunit resulted in a compensatory gabaa-r response that increased the functional activity of gabaa-rs in brain areas involved in regulating food intake, e.g., the hypothalmus. however, the role of gaba in the mechanisms governing food intake and body weight is unclear. gaba has been shown to be colocalized with neuropeptide-y neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus  <cit>  which contact and inhibit arcuate proopiomelanocortin neurons  <cit>  that suppress food intake. we have observed that β <dig> is reduced ~50% in the hypothalamus of forebrain selective knockouts . however, gabaa-r-containing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus of the brainstem have also been postulated to be involved in gaba-mediated increases in food intake  <cit> . while gaba is clearly involved in regulating body weight, the ubiquitous nature of gaba in the brain makes determining the mechanisms involved difficult. the ability to manipulate expression of a predominant gabaa-r subunit in an anatomically-specific manner is an important first step in unraveling the role of gaba in regulating body weight.

a previous study revealed that global β <dig> knockout mice were less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of etomidate  <cit> . however, because of the ubiquitious nature of the β <dig> knockout, developmental compensation was observed  <cit>  that made it impossible to determine if the reduction in anesthetic sensitivity was due to deletion of a direct target of etomidate or due to a compensatory change in an unknown target. in the current study, we demonstrated that inactivation of β <dig> selectively in forebrain neurons after ~ <dig> weeks of postnatal life also resulted in reduced sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic response to etomidate. this result, together with results derived from gene knockin studies  <cit>  lead us to suggest that β <dig>  and not a compensatory change in an unknown target, is a direct target for some of the anesthetic effects of etomidate.

reportedly, β <dig> containing gabaa-rs are also important for mediating the effects of ethanol  <cit> . however, the sedative/hypnotic effect of ethanol was not changed by conditional  or global inactivation  <cit>  of the β <dig> gene. thus, the β <dig> subunit is not necessary for the sedative/hypnotic effect of ethanol. other behavioral effects of ethanol  remain to be tested in these mice.

it is unknown why the cleft palate, mortality, body weight, and behavioral phenotypes are variably penetrant within the various β <dig> mutant mouse lines. it is possible that animal-to-animal variability exists because of genetic heterogeneity in the background of the animals. none of the mutant mouse lines used here were maintained on a uniform, inbred genetic background. genetic background has been demonstrated to substantially alter the incidence of cleft palate in global β <dig> knockouts  <cit> . detailed investigation of β <dig> mutants maintained on a hybrid genetic background could be used to search for modifier genes that interact with the gabaergic system in palate development .

alternatively, a possibility exists that those β <dig> mutant animals that escaped from palate defects and neonatal mortality were able to invoke a compensatory pathway to overcome the genetic defect. indeed, global knockouts exhibited substantial compensatory responses  <cit> . although deletion of β <dig> after birth would circumvent developmental compensation during early development, it is still possible  that compensation also occurred in those mice. for example, we have observed that in the cortex of the forebrain selective knockouts, the amount of the α <dig> subunit of the gabaa-r was also reduced . it is not clear if this is truly a compensatory change or if it reflects an obligate subunit partnership of β <dig> with α <dig> in this brain region. nonetheless, while conditional knockout mice may circumvent some issues observed in global knockouts such as compensation during embryonic development, the conditional knockout approach is not without limitations.

the new line of genetically engineered mice described in this report, i.e., mice with a floxed β <dig> gene, will be invaluable for a wide variety of studies. as demonstrated in the current study, knockout of β <dig> by the traditional method of crossing the floxed mice to a cre recombinase expressing transgenic mouse can be used to make tissue specific and/or temporally regulated conditional knockouts. addition of a regulated cre recombinase, such as cre-er that is regulated by tamoxifen  <cit> , would provide even greater temporal control over the conditional nature of the knockout. the floxed β <dig> mice will also be useful for nontraditional methods of creating conditional knockouts such as stereotaxic microinjection of cre expressing viral vectors  <cit>  or in vivo electroporation of cre expressing plasmids  <cit> . this wide variety of approaches for producing mice that conditionally lack β <dig> will open up new avenues for investigating the role of β <dig> in normal physiology and pathophysiology.

CONCLUSIONS
a mutant mouse line that harbors a floxed β <dig> subunit of the gabaa-r was successfully produced. pan-neuronal and forebrain selective knockout of β <dig> revealed new insight into the role of the β <dig> subunit in palate formation, embryonic and postnatal viability, behavior, body weight regulation, and etomidate sensitivity. the floxed β <dig> mice described in this report will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the β <dig> subunit of the gabaa-r in various developmental processes, normal physiology, and pathophysiologic disorders such as angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.
