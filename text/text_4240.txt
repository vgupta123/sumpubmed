BACKGROUND
the tail-anchored  membrane proteins include diverse family members such as cytochrome b <dig>  dmpk a, & c, bcl- <dig>  tom, and sec <dig> β & γ which are critical for cell function  <cit> . several of these proteins, such as synaptobrevin, are important in vesicle transport and membrane fusion  <cit> . the tail-anchor of ta proteins is defined as the c-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain which may be flanked by hydrophilic amino acid residues  <cit> . the tail-anchors can target proteins to a wide range of subcellular compartments including the er   <cit> , the mom   <cit> , peroxisomes  <cit> , the perinuclear membrane  <cit>  and the chloroplast outer envelope in plants  <cit> . the molecular mechanism by which tail anchored proteins target specific membranes is of much interest. there appears to be no consensus amino acid sequence in the different tas of proteins that dictate their targeting. in fact the sequence of the amino acids in the transmembrane domain has been shown to be irrelevant in synaptobrevin, where a poly-leucine tail  targets the protein to the er  <cit> . however, all tail anchors are predominantly hydrophobic in nature, as determined from the amino acid sequence of the membrane spanning region. some studies indicate that there may be recognition motifs contained within the ta for proteins such as pex <dig> and pex15p, which cause them to target the peroxisome  <cit> . no such motifs have been identified for tas which target proteins to the er or the mom. however, some tas which target proteins to the mom, are flanked by positively-charged residues adjacent to the membrane-spanning region which are believed to dictate their targeting to either the er, or both the er and the mom  <cit> . this has led to the view that the p ositive charges individually or collectively in and around the ta determines its subcellular targeting  <cit> . other studies by biellharz et al.,  <cit> , brambillasca et al.,  <cit>  and wattenberg et al.,  <cit>  have provided evidence that the hydrophobicity of a tail anchor sequence itself can also influence which organelle it will target. weather this is a unifying concept involved in targeting all tas remains to be explored. the sarcolemmal membrane associated protein  is a tail-anchored protein which can carry two alternatively spliced tas  <cit> . all slmap isoforms are encoded by one gene and many slmap isoforms have now been shown to be expressed in a tissue specific manner with proposed roles in myoblast fusion, excitation-contraction coupling and centrosomal organization  <cit> . the largest slmap isoform, the  <dig> kda slmap <dig>  is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues whilst the smallest isoform, the  <dig> kda slmap <dig>  is only expressed in cardiac and muscle tissue  <cit> . each slmap isoform shares the c-terminal region of the protein but the smaller isoforms do not possess the n-terminal structures such as the fha domain  <cit> .

we have previously shown that when ta <dig> or ta <dig> are encoded as part of slmap <dig> they direct it to subcellular membrane structures  <cit>  but which organelles they target and how, has not been defined. in addition, we have found that slmap carrying either ta <dig> or ta <dig> can be differentially expressed in the same tissue  <cit>  further more, immunohistological and biochemical analysis implies that slmap localizes in different subcellular compartments within the cardiomyocytes including the sarcolemma, sr/er, and the transverse tubules  <cit> . ta <dig> comprises  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted transmembrane helix of  <dig> residues and ta <dig> comprises  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted transmembrane helix of  <dig> residues  <cit> . in this study we identify how ta <dig> and ta <dig> affect the subcellular targeting of slmap <dig> in cos <dig> cells and provide evidence which supports the view that the overall hydrophobic profile of a tail anchor is critical for determining its subcellular localization. further more, our analysis indicates that slmap <dig> itself is not involved in vesicle transport but can target the er as well as the mitochondria, possibly the mom, where it may play previously unrecognized roles in the subcellular function of these organelles.

RESULTS
slmap is a component of intracellular membranes in non-muscle cells
the sr is derived from smooth endoplasmic reticulum, an extensive membrane-bound organelle, which contributes to general intracellular calcium regulation in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in view of the abundant slmap expression in the sr of cardiac cells and the ubiquitous distribution of the  <dig> kda slmap varient  <cit> , we sought to determine whether this slmap isoform is also a component of membrane systems  in non-muscle cells. microsomes were prepared from the postnuclear supernatant of rat liver homogenates and further separated into er and golgi fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation   <cit> . protein fractions from each gradient were collected and separated by sds-page and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-slmap antibodies as well as specific markers of the er  and a cis-golgi marker . a  <dig> kda slmap isoform, consistent with the molecular size of the full length slmap protein, distributed with calnexin in fractions b <dig> and sgf <dig> but was not enriched in the fractions with the highest levels of calnexin  . slmap was absent in the stack golgi fraction where α-mannosidase was enriched, and was present in sgf <dig> and sgfl together with some calnexin . these data suggest that slmap is not a resident of the golgi although it may be present in specific regions of the er in the liver. it seems likely that the difference between the distribution of slmap and calnexin is due to a combination of the properties of the tail anchors in the liver slmap as well as the lipid composition in the different forms and regions of the er.

tail anchors in slmap target distinct subcellular membranes
in order to determine weather the two carboxyl-terminal tas utilized by slmap can target to distinct membrane structures, 6myc-tagged slmap <dig> carrying ta <dig> or ta <dig> was transfected in cos <dig> and its localization monitored relative to various components of intracellular organelles. slmap <dig> is a  <dig> kda isoform which is expressed predominantly in cardiac and muscle tissue, and was found to be an integral membrane protein  <cit> . co-staining with the er marker calnexin demonstrated significant co-distribution with 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig> at reticular formations ; however limited co-distribution was observed in cells expressing 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig> . since slmap contains a coiled-coil leucine zipper involved in homodimerization  <cit> , we investigated whether this motif will influence targeting. as shown,  a deletion mutant lacking the leucine zipper  6myc-slmap1-ta2Δlz had identical targeting when compared to the undeleted, expressed protein. anti-ergic- <dig> monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the er-golgi intermediate compartment and consistently labelled fine punctuate structures concentrated at perinuclear sites in cos <dig> cells  <cit> . this distribution pattern was distinct from that of either 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig>  or  <dig> myc-slmap1-ta <dig> . whereas myc staining demonstrated that ta <dig> and ta <dig> direct slmap <dig> to perinuclear sites, no co-localization with the anti-golgi58k monoclonal antibody was noted . further, the fungal metabolite brefeldin a, a widely used agent that disrupts the structure of the golgi apparatus  <cit>  did not alter the subcellular distribution of slmap <dig> .

disruption of the cytoskeleton and slmap localization
we examined the localization of endogenous slmap with anti-slmap antibodies and compared this with the er marker calnexin using anti-calnexin antibodies and a clear co-distribution of these two proteins is evident . the importance of cytoskeleton for the organization of the membrane organelles such as the er has been demonstrated by the pharmacological disruption of microtubules  <cit> . in cells treated with the microtubule depolymerising agent nocodazole, the er membrane collapses and aggregates around the nucleus  <cit> . under conditions that disrupt microtubules, the distribution of the ectopically expressed er-membrane associated slmap <dig> variant  was altered from a reticular-like distribution  to an aggregate-like distribution . these nocodazole-induced structures were not however observed in cos <dig> cells expressing slmap <dig> deletion mutant lacking the ta  . the effect of nocodazole on microtubule assembly was confirmed by staining with α-tubulin, which illustrated a distinct redistribution of the cytoplasmic microtubules . these observations imply that slmap1-membrane associations require an intact microtubule network and would be consistent with the distribution of slmap1-ta <dig> at the er membrane.

to determine whether slmaps are associated with the actin cytoskeleton, cos <dig> cells expressing 6myc-slmap <dig> fusion proteins were treated with cytochalasin d, an actin myofilament disrupting agent  <cit> . depolymerization of the actin filaments with cytochalasin d did not alter the localization of 6myc-slmap <dig> fusion proteins carrying either ta <dig>  or ta <dig> , whilst inducing actin-containing microfilaments to change from filamentous  to punctuate structures .

slmap and er-golgi transport
comparisons of the predicted primary structure of slmap indicates general similarities with coiled-coil ta anchored proteins involved in transport of vesicles from the er and the docking of vesicles at the golgi  <cit> . analysis of the amino acid sequences encoding slmaps  also indicated the presence of a putative di-acidic sorting signal upstream of the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain.  di-acidic motifs, defined by asp/glu residues separated by a variable residue x, are often located in close proximity to tyrosine-based sorting motifs  and are thought to mediate efficient export of the protein from the er by interacting with the vesicular transport machinery  <cit> . in slmap a tyrosine-based sorting motif  is present upstream of the di-acidic sorting motif. in view of these features we investigated whether slmaps are involved in vesicular transport from the er to the golgi. previous studies have shown that overexpression of coiled-coil membrane proteins involved in vesicle trafficking from the er to golgi inhibit protein export from the er  <cit> . to examine this possibility, cos <dig> cells were co-transfected with an er-localized 6myc-slmap <dig> and the gfp-tagged glycoprotein of the temperature sensitive strain of vesicular stomatitis virus , which serves as a marker of er to golgi transport. when maintained at the restrictive temperature , the viral glycoprotein could not be exported from the er due to a thermoreversible-folding defect  and consequently co-distributed with 6myc-slmap <dig> . proper folding and subsequent transport out of the er to the golgi and cell periphery was achieved when the ts045-vsv-g transfected cells were incubated at the permissive temperature . whereas the gfp-labelled viral glycoprotein was transported out of the er to the golgi and plasma membrane under conditions that promote vesicular transport , the 6myc-slmap fusion protein did not appear to exit the er  as clearly indicated in the overlay . expression of the slmap <dig> lacking either the transmembrane domain or the leucine zipper motifs did not affect the ability of the viral glycoprotein to exit the er at the permissive temperature . cos <dig> cells co-expressing ts045-vsv-g-gfp and 6myc-slmap <dig> were also incubated at reduced temperatures to monitor whether slmap <dig> cycles from the er to the ergic  <cit> . at 15°c the membrane associated slmap <dig> was retained in the er , whereas the gfp-labelled viral glycoprotein was visualized as vesicular clusters concentrated at perinuclear sites  consistent with localization at the ergic . collectively, these studies indicate that slmap <dig> is not exported via the vesicular transport process nor does elevated expression of slmap <dig> affect transport and is consistent with its absence from the stack golgi fraction.

hydrophobic profiles of the tas in slmap
a single gene encodes slmap which undergoes alternative splicing to generate distinct isoforms with unique tail anchors which serve roles in myoblast fusion, centrosomal function and excitation-contraction coupling  <cit> . exon xxiii  encodes  <dig> amino acids which comprise the alternatively spliced ta, referred to as ta <dig>  exon xxiv encodes  <dig> amino acids which form the constitutively expressed ta, referred to as ta <dig>  <cit> . to more clearly define slmap targeting, the nature of the tas in slmap was explored using the hmmtop program which predicted that slmap's two alternatively spliced c-terminal exons contain a single putative transmembrane domain  <cit>  . ta <dig>  encoded by exon xxiii, contains a predicted transmembrane helix of  <dig> amino acids flanked by five amino acid residues at the n-terminal end and four residues at the c-terminal end. ta <dig>  encoded by exon xxvi, is predicted to contain a transmembrane helix of nineteen amino acids flanked by seven residues at the n-terminal end and five residues at the c-terminus. the two tas have no sequence homology, but have similar properties, in that they are largely hydrophobic domains . the major difference between the two tas is the presence of a basic amino acid residue on either flank of the membrane spanning region in ta <dig>  which are not present in ta <dig> .

numerous reports have shown that the presence of positively charged residues in the regions flanking the membrane spanning region can cause a ta to target the mom rather that the er  <cit> . a simple examination of the flanking sequences of ta <dig> and ta <dig> shows that only ta <dig> possesses positively charged residues in this region . this suggests that ta <dig> may target the mom whilst ta <dig> could target the er. however, some er targeting tas possesses positively charged residues in the flanking regions  <cit> , so we might conclude that there may be additional factors involved in the targeting of tas. it has been shown that the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane region can affect the membrane targeting of a ta  <cit> .

the hydrophobicity of the ta <dig> and ta <dig> was calculated using the eisenberg normalised scale with a window size of  <dig>  the relative weight for window edges was 100%   <cit> . the hydrophobicity scores for the two putative trans-membrane domains differ in several regions. ta <dig> is more hydrophobic over the first five residues which form the n-terminal flanking region and the last five residues, which form the c-terminal flanking region . however, the largest difference between the slmap tas can be seen in the transmembrane region. ta <dig> is much more hydrophobic than ta <dig> between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  with ta <dig> having a maximum score of  <dig>  whilst ta <dig> reaches  <dig> . this data led us to believe that the difference in hydrophobicity between the two tas may be enough to result in differential targeting.

ta <dig> sequences can target slmap <dig> to mitochondria
the endogenous localisation of slmap in cos <dig> cells was examined using anti-slmap antibodies  and compared with the mitochondrial marker tom <dig>  <cit>  . the co-distribution  shows that a significant amount of the endogenous slmap co-distributes with tom <dig> however there are regions in the cell, where slmap is present without tom- <dig>  these regions would be consistent with the presence of slmap at the er as noted by anti-calnexin staining . the subcellular localization of the ectopically expressed slmap <dig> variants encoding ta <dig> and ta <dig> were further analysed with respect to tom <dig> and mom localization. dual immunostaining using anti-tom <dig> and anti-myc antibodies showed that the 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig> variant did not localize at the mitochondria . a mitochondrion is indicated by the arrow in figure 6e. whereas, co-distribution of tom <dig> with the 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig> indicated that this variant may target the mom, whilst still being present in a filamentous structure throughout the cytoplasm in a similar way to the ta <dig> construct . the filamentous structure targeted by 6myc-slmap1-ta <dig> is indicated by an arrow in figure 6i. it seems clear that slmap1-ta <dig> targets the mitochondria but in addition it also shows co-localization with calnexin at the er  which is distinct from the exclusive localization of slmap1-ta <dig> at the er .

in order to determine the molecular properties of ta <dig> which are responsible for mitochondrial membrane targeting we performed mutational analysis of the tail anchor and flanking regions. we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute hydrophobic residues for the positively charged residues in the flanking regions to see if ta <dig> was targeted to the mitochondria via these positively charged residues. the first amino acid in ta <dig>  a lysine residue, was substituted with a leucine residue to remove the n-terminal flanking positive charge, to create the mutant ta2-k1/l . the 27th amino acid, an arginine residue, was substituted with a leucine residue to remove the c-terminal flanking positive charge in the mutant ta2-r27/l . these two mutations were combined in the mutant ta2-k1/l+r27/l to remove both flanking positively charged residues . the myc tagged mutant constructs, slmap1-ta2-k1/l, slmap1-ta2-r27/l and slmap1-ta2-k1/l+r27/l were transfected into cos <dig> cells and compared with gfp tagged slmap1-ta <dig> for targeting properties. no change in the targeting of slmap1-ta <dig> was observed due to these mutations suggesting that the positive residues are not responsible for the targeting of ta <dig> to the mitochondria .

the mutations introduced in ta <dig> above increased the hydrophobicity of the flanking sequences, without affecting the hydrophobic profile of the transmembrane region itself . to test whether the hydrophobic properties of the transmembrane sequence in ta <dig> were important for the targeting of slmap <dig> to the mitochondria we constructed mutants with increased hydrophobicity in their transmembrane domain. four mutations were made in ta <dig> to construct a mutant ta <dig> transmembrane region with similar hydrophobic properties to ta <dig> . the alanine residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> along with threonine  <dig> were all substituted with leucine residues to make slmap1-ta <dig> a10/l+a11/l+t16/l+a17/l  . we transfected myc tagged slmap1-ta2-4l into cos <dig> cells and co-transfected with wild type gfp tagged slmap1-ta <dig>  the ta2-4l mutant did not overlap with the wild type ta <dig> in many areas in the cell . when we transfected cos <dig> cells with the myc tagged slmap1-ta2-4l mutant and co-stained with anti-tom <dig> antibodies we saw no overlap with the mitochondrial marker . we co-transfected the myc tagged slmap1-ta2-4l mutant with a gfp tagged wild type slmap1-ta <dig> the observed overlap indicated that both constructs target slmap <dig> to the same cellular compartment . thus it appears that the ta2-4l mutant shares the targeting properties of wild type ta <dig> 

to determine whether a smaller change in hydrophobicity could produce a similar alteration of targeting, we constructed a mutant with two changes in the trans-membrane domain . the alanine amino acid residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> were substituted with leucine to create slmap1-ta <dig> a10/l+a11/l  . when we co-transfected myc tagged slmap1-ta2-2l with wild type gfp tagged slmap1-ta <dig> in cos <dig> cells we observed that the ta2-2l mutant only partially co-localised with ta <dig> . the myc tagged slmap1-ta2-2l was transfected into cos <dig> cells and co-stained with anti-tom <dig> antibodies. there was no overlap between the ta2-2l mutant and the mom marker tom <dig> . we co-transfected cos <dig> cells with myc tagged slmap1-ta2-2l and wild type gfp tagged slmap1-ta <dig> and observed nearly complete overlap of the two . the results of the ta2-4l and ta2-2l were largely identical, indicating both mutants share the same targeting properties, which were observed to be the same as wild type ta <dig> 

the ta2-4l mutant has a transmembrane region that is only slightly less hydrophobic than the wild type ta <dig>  they were found to share similar targeting properties despite the ta2-4l mutant still possessing positively charged amino acid residues in both of the regions flanking its trans-membrane domain, with the corresponding decrease in the hydrophobicity of these regions  . the ta2-2l mutant has a much less hydrophobic trans-membrane region than both ta <dig> and ta2-4l, but is still more hydrophobic than wild type ta <dig> over amino acids 6– <dig> . however, it also shares the same targeting properties as ta1; despite it like ta2-4l possessing flanking positively charged amino acids . it appears from this data that the ta <dig> transmembrane region is at the very edge of the hydrophobic range which will target a ta to the mom. this may be the reason that ta <dig> is promiscuous in targeting slmap <dig> to mitochondria and er.

the ta2-k1/l+r27/l mutant which has the positively charged amino acids replaced with leucine does have an increase in hydrophobicity compared with wild type ta <dig> but only in the regions flanking the transmembrane domain . the hydrophobicity of the trans-membrane region of the ta2-k1/l+r27/l mutant remains the same as the wild type ta <dig> trans-membrane region . these data suggest that the targeting of ta <dig> to the mitochondria is due to the reduced hydrophobicity of the transmembrane region in comparison with the ta <dig> transmembrane region rather than the presence of the positively charged amino acid residues in the flanking sequences.

discussion
tail anchored  membrane proteins are important in several cellular processes including neurotransmitter release, vesicle transport, membrane fusion and signal transduction  <cit> . all tail anchors comprise a c-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region which may be flanked by positively charged residues which are promiscuous in terms of sub-cellular targeting  <cit> . these features are present in the slmap c-terminal region and may account for its distinct pattern of localization observed here in the liver versus cos  <dig> cells compared with the cardiomyocytes  <cit> . it is notable that endogenous slmap co-localised with the er marker calnexin and the mitochondrial marker tom <dig> implying that it is like other ta proteins such as bcl <dig> which also reside in these distinct membranes  <cit> . the different tas utilized by slmap appear to be responsible for the targeting of slmap <dig> to distinct subcellular structures including the er and mitochondria, perhaps the mom.

the information required for the targeting of slmap to intracellular membranes was not contained in specific amino acids that flank the predicted transmembrane domain but was dictated by the overall hydrophobic profile of the ta. we found that slmap <dig> could target either the er alone or the er and the mitochondria in cos <dig> cells depending on which of the two alternative tail anchors  were being expressed. the disruption of the cytoskeleton with nocodazole showed that the distribution patterns of slmap <dig> are dependent on an intact microtubule network. this is wholly consistent with changes in distribution noted for other er resident proteins, and the known role of the cytoskeleton in anchoring intracellular membranes in place  <cit> . it is interesting to speculate that slmap may act as a potential molecular link between intracellular membranes and the microtubule based cytoskeleton. several membrane associated proteins provide a link between intracellular membranes and the microtubule cytoskeleton including clips  <cit>  and the er membrane protein p <dig>  <cit> . such interactions, which may also involve slmap, are crucial for the positioning and structural maintenance of subcellular organelles  <cit> .

tail anchors comprise a single membrane spanning helix of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues at the c-terminal end of the protein  <cit> . investigations have shown that the replacement of basic residues in the regions flanking the membrane helix with hydrophobic residues can alter the targeting of tas  <cit> . it would appear that the presence of positively charged residues in the flanking regions increases the likelihood of the ta targeting the mom instead of the er  <cit> .

the two different tail anchors in slmap are generated by alternative splicing and both appear to target the protein to subcellular locations. both ta <dig> and ta <dig> target slmap <dig> to the er. ta <dig> also targets slmap <dig> the mitochondria as evidenced by co-localization with tom <dig>  we found that this differential targeting was due to the lower hydrophobic content of the trans-membrane helix in ta <dig> when compared to the alternatively spliced ta <dig>  immunohistochemistry indicates that ta <dig> directs slmap <dig> predominantly to the er and not the mitochondria probably due to the more hydrophobic nature of the transmembrane domain. we were able to prevent ta <dig> from targeting the mitochondria by the substitution of moderately hydrophobic amino acids with the highly hydrophobic leucine residues implying that the important targeting information in ta <dig> is the relative hydrophobicity of the transmembrane region. in this regard bielharz et al.,  <cit>  observed a similar shift in the targeting of fis <dig> from the mom to the er when the hydrophobicity of its ta was increased.

we found no evidence to suggest that the positively charged amino acids which flank the membrane spanning helix are responsible for the targeting of ta <dig> to the mitochondria per-se. this is in contrast to the view that basic amino acids flanking the ta are responsible for mom targeting  <cit> . it seems more likely that in these cases the substitution of the positively charged, and therefore highly hydrophilic, amino acids results in an increase in the overall hydrophobicity of the ta and altered targeting. however, this did not occur in our ta <dig> k1/l r27/l mutants despite the hydrophobicity of the flanking regions being increased to a level above that of the ta <dig> isoform. recently it has been shown that artificial tas require a moderately hydrophobic transmembrane region to target the mom  <cit> . consistent with this speculation, the directed substitution of  <dig> amino acid residues in the flanking region in ta <dig> of slmap <dig> did not sufficiently change hydrophobic nature to shift targeting.

the presence of the two alternatively spliced exons encoding tail anchors which target slmap <dig> to different locations suggests slmap <dig> may perform multiple subcellular functions. given the coiled-coil nature of the majority of the slmap protein, it may be that it tethers proteins into place on both the er and perhaps the mom. alternatively, it may be involved in tethering of the two membrane systems together through homo/hetero-dimerisation. differential levels of expression of slmap with the different tas, suggest that slmap may serve varying subcellular roles in tissue specific manner  <cit> . in this regard, the expression levels of slmap were found to be important for normal myoblast fusion  <cit> . slmap was not found to be localized with the vesicle transport mechanism nor did its over expression affect vesicle transport in cos <dig> cells, this implies that it is not involved in intracellular trafficking.

while the mechanism of ta protein membrane insertion remains to be defined, it appears that both the srp  and a novel mechanism utilizing atp appear to be involved  <cit> . which of these mechanisms is utilised by slmap remains unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
our data here supports the view that the sub-cellular targeting of slmap is determined by the overall hydrophobicity of its alternative tail-anchor . further, the basic amino acid residues in the regions flanking the transmembrane helix contribute to the overall hydrophobic profile of the ta and its targeting rather then the individual residues being a targeting signal. further more, the potential association of slmap with the mom implies additional roles for this molecule in mitochondrial function.
