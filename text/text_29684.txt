BACKGROUND
the sequencing of bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of integrated viral genomes  in most of the sequenced bacterial genomes  <cit>  prophage dna sequences can constitute up to 10–20% of the bacterial genome and are major contributors for differences between individual species  <cit> . prophage gene expression may influence the pathogenicity or the general fitness of the bacterium  <cit> . the list of genes regulated by bacteriophage is very long and represents a broad group of genes .

analysis of prophage dna suggests that integration into bacterial genomes can lead to changes including inactivating point mutations, genome rearrangements, modular exchanges, invasion by further mobile dna elements, and massive dna deletion  <cit> . bacteriophage have been described that can produce plaques on certain commensal neisseria  <cit> . bacteriophage able to propagate in n. meningitidis have been identified, but they were not able to propagate on other neisseria strains  <cit> . similarly, the presence of autoplaquing in n. gonorrhoeae was observed but no phage propagation was seen  <cit> .

dna sequence analysis has identified prophage dna sequences in the genomes of most bacteria. in n. meningitidis, they belong to two groups of phages. the presence of the mu-like prophage sequences was detected in the genomes of serogroup a strains of the epidemic subgroups i, iii, iv- <dig> and vi of n. meningitidis  <cit> . two additional mu-like sequences were found in n. meningitidis serotype a  <cit> . a ~ <dig> -kb region named as pnm <dig>  <cit>  looks as if it could also encode for a functional bacteriophage. a sequence homologous to pnm <dig> was found in the genome of serogroup b n. meningitidis but not in genome of n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig>  <cit> . the second group consists of filamentous prophage sequences homologous to f <dig> and ctxΦ  <cit> . these prophages can excise, albeit with very low frequency, from the bacterial genome resulting in the production of biologically active phages  <cit> .

in this paper we describe properties of prophage sequences present in n. gonorrhoeae genomes  that all belong to dsdna tailed group of bacteriophage. we show the biological activity of some of the prophage genes and the presence of the prophage dna sequences in bacterial cultures. we further demonstrate the production of phage particles by gonococci. however, we were unable to demonstrate the production of plaques on any of the n. gonorrhoeae or on non pathogenic neisseria strains tested.

RESULTS
overall genetic structure of ngoΦ <dig> – ngoΦ <dig> prophages
annotation of the coding sequences in the published genomic sequence of n. gonorrhoeae strain fa <dig>  <cit>  indicated that the gonococcus possesses  <dig> genomic regions that encode proteins with significant homology to proteins found in dsdna bacteriophages. the location of the coding sequences of each of these genomic regions is described in table  <dig>  we have designated these regions ngoΦ <dig> to ngoΦ <dig>  we determined the overall distribution of guanine and cytosine residues in the gonococcal chromosome, determined the g+c content by the windows sliding method for the putative prophage sequences, and identified their location on the gonococcal chromosome . four of the prophage sequences have a higher g + c content  while one  has a lower g + c content  as compare to an average g + c content of  <dig> % of n. gonorrhoeae genomic dna. the location of each of the prophage coding sequences, while differing in g+c content from the overall gonococcal chromosome, did not appear to be significantly different from the regions immediately adjacent to the prophage sequences. we analyzed the codon usage for the predicted orfs of the prophage regions and compared them to the overall codon usage of the gonococcus. while some of the orfs appeared to have significant codon usage differences, the variations were no greater than what was obtained when we generated a codon usage profile for the two beta subunits of rna polymerase . this observation prevented us from drawing any evolutionary inferences, based on base content or codon usage.

note that the sequence of ngoΦ <dig> is inserted within the sequence of ngoΦ3

the five prophage sequences homologous with dsdna phages ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. blast and megablast  searches performed against the non-redundant database did not shown homology to any dna sequences, except to very small regions in the genomes of n. meningitidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa phage f <dig>  this analysis also showed that the two, almost identical  blocks of dna,  present at the left hand end of ngoΦ <dig> are present in the sequence of ngoΦ <dig> and one of them is also present in the sequence of ngoΦ <dig> . these blocks include genes whose predicted function would be either regulatory or structural. the genome of ngoΦ <dig> is divided into two parts due to the presence of the inserted genomic sequence of a filamentous phage . the ngoΦ <dig> prophage sequence was probably derived from ngoΦ <dig> or ngoΦ <dig>  the sequences of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> are not homologous and do not share any homology with any of the other phages.

we analyzed the protein coding sequences  for all five putative prophage sequences. putative orfs greater than  <dig> amino acids were identified using a combination of cds identification programs. the results of this analysis show that the identified prophage islands contain cdss with striking amino acid similarities to known functional phage proteins . the length and the coding capacity of genomic dna of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> suggest that they could represent biologically active prophages. we also noted the presence of four filamentous ssdna-like prophage sequences that share very high homology to such sequences in the n. meningitidis genome . since the genomic organization of these phage have been described for a variety of neisserial stains  <cit> , we did not focus our studies on them.


analysis of the cdss encoded by this phage allowed us to clearly identify two blocks of genes encoding structural and assembly proteins. the longer block spanning from ngo <dig> to ngo <dig> includes such genes as ngo <dig> and ngo <dig> which encode small and large terminase subunits respectively, ngo <dig> which encodes phage portal protein and ngo <dig>  which encodes a phage tail protein. the smaller block of structural genes is located at the end of phage genome  and encodes the tail protein. the remaining cdss encode either proteins of unknown function or other structural proteins. it is interesting that gene ngo <dig>  which interrupts the larger block, belongs to the transcriptional regulator family of genes. the regulatory modules include one well defined region  with ngo <dig> encoding a protein similar to ci-like repressor protein. two less defined regulatory modules are located in the region between ngo0515- <dig> and in the region of ngo <dig>  the main regulatory module are predicted to encode not only ci repressor but also other proteins that show some homology to phage and cell transcriptional regulatory proteins, , or the presence of a domain specific for regulatory protein . ngo <dig> contains well defined helix-turn-helix motif  between i <dig> and f <dig> and high scoring  from v <dig> to d <dig> peptidase family s <dig>  these motifs are present in dna binding proteins, including the cro and ci proteins of phage lambda. ngo <dig> also contained a helix-turn-helix motif .

the special control region includes two cdss, ngo <dig> and ngo <dig>  which encode pemk and pemi-like proteins. the pemi-pemk system is an addiction module present on plasmid r <dig> that helps to maintain the plasmid by post-segregational killing of e. coli cells that have lost the plasmid  <cit> . pemk, the toxin encoded by the pemi-pemk addiction module, inhibits protein synthesis in an e. coli cell-free system, whereas the addition of pemi, the antitoxin against pemk, allows for the resumption of protein synthesis. these systems are also known to operate by stabilizing the presence of autonomously replicating prophages, like p <dig>  <cit> .

the third module includes genes that play a role in the replication of the phage genome. this module includes two well defined cdss, ngo <dig> and ngo <dig>  and a third cds, ngo <dig>  located to left end of the genome. ngo <dig> encodes a helicase with high homology to the phage p <dig> gene ban or gp <dig> of salmonella typhimurium bacteriophage st64t . all these proteins belong to pfam dnab, dnab-c family. ngo <dig> shows high homology to a dna replication protein of bacteriophage aaphi <dig> as well as other phages. finally, the ngo <dig> probably encodes the primase.

modular genome organization of phage ngoΦ2
the sequence of ngoΦ <dig> shows a modular organization and some regions possess almost 100% homology with the dna sequence of ngoΦ <dig>  the overall orientation of the dna sequence and the localization of the genes in ngoΦ <dig> are in the opposite orientation relative to ngoΦ <dig>  we were also unable to find repetitive dna sequences at the end of the dna sequence of the cdss encoding the integrases . the regions of homology cover the sequences from the left end of both phages  up to the beginning of the gene encoding presumptive recombination module, and the module of the structural genes, with the exception of the module controlling the transcription  in ngoΦ <dig> . this suggests that while these two dna sequences represent two different phages, they share homology between genes encoding the replication machinery but do not share homology between the genes responsible for the control of gene expression, maintenance of the state of lysogeny , in the recombination module and in the structural modules of both phages. the putative repressor  contains a well defined helix-turn-helix motif  between m <dig> and l <dig> and high scoring  peptidase family s <dig> motif from p <dig> to d <dig>  however, the putative antirepressor  is located at the end of the genome, a long distance from the repressor. ngo <dig> shows high homology to some of the phage antirepressors, like that of bacteriophage aaphi <dig> or e. coli prophage cp-933n.

the structural and assembly module, extending from ngo <dig> to ngo <dig>  contains the genes encoding the large and small terminase proteins  and the portal protein . the structural module contains one very large protein  encoded by ngo <dig>  whose c-terminal part shows some homology to dna methyltransferases. ngo <dig> would seem to encode a protein with homology to phage antirepressors. while the structural module of ngoΦ <dig>  shows high identity with p. aeruginosa phage f <dig>  the structural block of ngoΦ <dig> does not show high identity with any particular phage sequence.

modular genome organization of phage ngoΦ3
the dna sequence of ngoΦ <dig> is much smaller than ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> and is disrupted by the insertion of the dna sequence of ssdna phage ngoΦ <dig>  the first part of the sequence  encodes  <dig> cdss while the second part of  encodes only four cdss. the genome sequence starting with ngo <dig>  encodes a p-22-like integrase but without homology to the integrase encoded by ngoΦ <dig>  the majority of the dna sequence shows homology to dna sequence of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig>  two regions without homology include:  ngo <dig> – ngo <dig> responsible for the maintenance of lysogenic state  and  ngo0482-ngo <dig>  genes responsible for dna replication. there is also lack of the ngoΦ <dig> dna region encoding pemk-pemi proteins. however, the most important difference between the genomic sequences of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> is the lack of cdss encoding the structural protein . the second part of the genome of ngoΦ <dig> encodes the antirepressor protein  which is identical with ngo <dig> encoded by the phage ngoΦ <dig> 

modular genome organization of phages ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ5
phage dna sequences corresponding to ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig>  do not share any homology to each other, or with ngoΦ <dig>  ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig>  analysis of the homology of the cdss encoded by these two sequences indicates that neither of them represents a complete phage genome . the dna sequence of ngoΦ <dig> contains the genes encoding only the presumptive proteins engaged in the recombination, control of transcription and integration of dna. ngo <dig> and ngo <dig> contain motifs typically characteristic for the recbc family exonuclease protein, while ngo <dig> contains the core domain characteristic for pfam  <dig>  rve integrase. this family of genes is responsible for integration of the viral genome into the host chromosome. ngo <dig> encodes protein with high homology to the transcription regulator proteins encoded by several phages, among them the stx converting phages.

among the cdss encoded by the dna sequence of ngoΦ <dig> are ones that show high homology to structural and assembly proteins of different phages  but lack such homology to the small and large terminase subunits and the portal proteins. at the end of dna sequence are genes encoding a putative repressor and transposase. the organization of these genes resemble the pyocin r <dig> and f <dig> gene cluster present in p aeruginosa, which are phage tails that have been evolutionarily specialized as bacteriocins  <cit> .


biological activity of the prophage repressor genes
the maintenance of the lysogenic state is most often maintained by the action of a repressor gene. functionally, the repressor is silencing the activity of most of prophage genes. however, the expression of several genes, whose transcription is constitutive, is independent of its control. recently it was shown that host genes can be regulated by phage repressors active in the lysogenic cells  <cit> . if this were true for the dsdna prophages integrated into n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig>  we would expect that the phage repressors could influence the expression of cellular genes. we tested for their biological activity in e. coli.

the analysis of the ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> genomes allowed us to tentatively identify the repressor genes in both prophages as the cdss ngo <dig> and ngo <dig> . both genes carrying only the coding sequences were cloned in e. coli in pmpmk <dig> Ω  <cit> , where expression of the gene was placed under control of the pbad promoter. we expressed the repressor and tested it for its ability to influence the growth of e. coli and for its ability to inhibit the propagation of phage λ. the first experiment showed that even without induction, the presence in e. coli of a plasmid that encodes the repressors inhibits the growth of the host e. coli strain. the induction of ngo <dig> by arabinose resulted in cell death  but not cell lysis . loss of viability seemed to be dependent on the level of protein expression, as maximal induction of the pbad promoter  produced a rapid and almost immediate decrease in cell viability: lower amounts of induction produced reduced killing, or simple growth inhibition. a similar effect was also observed after induction of the expression of ngo <dig> . from this data we concluded that cell death results from the expression of the cloned phage genes.

to test if cell death was the result of the influence of the expression of chromosomally encoded genes, the influence of the expression of the two repressors on propagation of the phage λ was tested. plasmids encoding both repressors were introduced into e. coli  <dig>  a strain that is lysogenic with λcits <dig>  the induction of the ngo <dig> by the presence of  <dig> % arabinose, a concentration that induced the expression of some repressor and inhibited the growth of e. coli, did not result in significant death of the culture. heat induction of the λ phage did not induce cell lysis but blocked completely production of the progeny phage . on the other hand, the induction of the ngo <dig> and the heat induction of phage λ resulted in some cells lysis  and the  <dig> times lower phage production than without the presence of the ngo <dig> gene product . this data indicates that very low level of expression of both repressors influences the propagation of the λ phage.

since the expression of the phage repressors affected the growth of e. coli, we hypothesized that it was influencing the expression of as yet undefined genes. to further support this hypothesis, we tested the influence of the ngo <dig> product on the expression of different hp <dig> phage promoters. we constructed plasmids carrying transcriptional fusions in which the xyle gene was expressed from the different hp <dig> phage promoters. the data in table  <dig> indicate that both promoters are active in e. coli, as evidenced by the presence of xyle activity in supernatants obtained from host cells grown in the absence of arabinose. when arabinose was added, the xyle activity found in supernatants isolated from these strains indicates that plhp <dig> promoter but not prhp <dig> activity is inhibited. this data indicates that the ngo <dig> gene product can differentially repress promoter activity, and suggests that its expression in the gonococcus could silence prophage gene expression in the n. gonorrhoeae genome.

aone unit of xyle activity corresponds to the formation of  <dig> nmol of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde per min at 22°c.

the putative holin proteins
most bacteriophage must lyse their host cells to liberate the progeny virions. the decision of when to terminate the infection and to lyse the host is the only major decision made in the vegetative cycle  <cit> . thus, if the prophage sequences present in the genome of n. gonorrhoeae are able to excise from the bacterial genome and produce progeny, they should encode a lytic system. phages with double-stranded nucleic acid genomes use the "holin-endolysin" strategy  <cit> . in this scheme, the phage encodes murein-degrading enzyme, an endolysin, and a second membrane-embedded protein, holin, which serves to activate the endolysin at the defined time. holins are small membrane proteins that accumulate in the cytoplasmic membrane of the host. the holins are represented by more than  <dig> members belonging to  <dig> gene families with no recognizable detectable sequence similarity  <cit> . the common property of all holins is the presence of one or more trans-membrane domains  <cit> , which allows for their identification in the phage sequences. our analysis of the proteins encoded by the prophage ngoΦ1-ngoΦ <dig> sequences suggested that the ngo <dig>  ngo <dig> and ngo <dig> could potentially encode a holin. ngo <dig> and  <dig> are identical and encode for a protein of  <dig> amino acids, while ngo <dig> encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids. these proteins do not showhomology to any other proteins and each possesses one tm domain. to test whether the ngoΦ <dig> putative holin can act as a true holin, we tested to see if this cds could complement mutations in the phage λ s gene. for controlled expression of ngo <dig>  this gene was inserted downstream of the pbad promoter of pmpmk <dig>  <cit>  resulting in the construct pmpmk6hol. the e. coli mm  <dig> cells , carrying the plasmid pmpmk6::hol were grown at 30°c to the optical density of od <dig> of  <dig> . at that time, the heat shock was carried out  and arabinose was added to a final concentration of  <dig> %. in the presence of hol gene of ngoΦ <dig> phage, even without its induction, the cells grew very slowly. we were unable to detect the lysis of these cells after induction by arabinose . thus, in these experiments the uninduced level of holin was sufficient to inhibit the growth of e. coli cells, carrying an uninduced λ prophage.

in order to assess whether hol resembles s and other holins-particularly with respect to the salutary triggering phenotype that characterizes holin functions, conditions which allow for even tighter regulation of the pbad promoter but allow for a high level of induction were needed. the experiments were then carried out in a similar way, but the culture, prior to heat inactivation and arabinose induction, was grown in the presence of 1% glucose, to further block the pbad promoter through catabolic repression. the growth in the presence of glucose was still slower than the growth of e. coli mm  <dig> cells  without the presence of hol gene. however the induction of hol gene resulted in abrupt lysis of entire culture, with the onset of lysis occurring about  <dig> min after induction . thus, like the well-studied λ holin s, and other phage holins, the holin of ngoΦ <dig> causes abrupt lysis of e. coli cells at a defined time.

presence of the dsdna phages in n. gonorrhoeae supernatants
to detect the presence of phage dna in phage particles released from the cells during growth, the same method was used as described previously for the detection of the filamentous ssdna phages in n. meningitidis cultures  <cit> . in this method, the presumptive phage particles are precipitated with peg and the precipitate intensively treated with dnase and rnase to remove contaminating bacterial genomic dna and rna. the dna is then isolated from the phage and used as a template in pcr reactions. the presence of the particular phage dna sequence in such phage preparations means that the prophage genome must be excised from the bacterial genome, and after a replication cycle, packaged into the phage particles and released from the cells.

in similar experiments, the presence of the dsdna isolated from the crude phage preparation obtained from the n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig> cultures was tested. using primers specific for ngoΦ <dig>  we were able to show the formation of predicted pcr product . to show that the phage preparation does not contain the bacterial genomic dna released from the growing bacterial cells, we performed a pcr amplification for the chromosomally encoded gene, lpt <dig>  the data  indicate that an amplicon was formed when chromosomal dna was used as template, but not when phage dna was employed. this result indicates that in n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig> the prophage sequences can be excised from the chromosome, replicate and form phage particles that are released from the bacterial cells. we also tested the possibility that such phage can form plaques on n. subflava, n. lactamica or n. cinerea cells, but without success .

after identifying conditions where we could isolate supernatants containing phage dna, we analyzed the culture supernatants for bacteriophage particles by electron microscopy. phage particles  were readily visualized by electron microscopy. the data presented in figure  <dig> is an example of one of the lambda-like phage particles. this phage clearly contains a head and tail structure. culture supernatants also contained numerous tail-less heads, and filamentous particles of varying lengths . given the diversity of phage encoding sequences in the genome of the producing strain, we did not attempt to determine which phage dnas sequence was responsible for the production of the phage shown.

discussion
the existence of prophage dna sequences in the bacterial chromosomes is very common  <cit> . it is also very common that several different prophage sequences can be present in the genome of a particular bacterial strain. for example, in eleven salmonella enterica serovars typhi and typhimurium, two yersinia pestis strains, shigella flexnerii, two xylella fastidiosa, and four e. coli strains that have been sequenced, each carries between  <dig> to  <dig> prophages . cryptic prophage dna sequences have been found in several n. meningitidis strains as well  <cit> . our analysis of nine dna sequences of n. gonorrhoeae allowed us to identify the presence of two different types of bacteriophage dna sequences in this species. the first group is represented by sequences that are homologous to the filamentous ssdna prophages recently discovered in the chromosome of n. meningitidis  <cit> . the second group is represented by the sequences that show the high homology to the tailed dsdna phages present in diverse groups of bacteria. the overall genetic organization of these phages resembles mostly that of p <dig> genome ld macrobutton endnote+.cit  <cit> . this is in sharp contrast to n. meningitidis where dsdna prophage sequences show homology to mu-like phages representing a very specific group of phages  <cit> .

ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> could encode functional bacteriophages since they seem to encode all of genes necessary for lytic growth. the ability to produce functional bacteriophage is further supported by the fact that we were able to detect the presence of some of these genes outside of the cells in a dnase resistant form . we were able to visualize phage particles. we showed that some of the genes are biologically active. since we were unable to further propagate phages on any of the strains tested, it suggests that each strain is expressing the appropriate lysogenic control genes.

it is much less probable that the phage belong to gene transfer agents that are tailed phage-like particles that encapsidate random fragments of the bacterial genome  <cit>  since we were unable to detect the chromosomal sequences in the dnase resistant forms. three of the dsdna prophages present in n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig> are probably defective forms of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig>  being in the stage of complex decay of prophages. we believe that ngoΦ <dig> can be classified as a bacteriocin since it seems to encode mainly the genes of phage tail.

the presence of two types of biologically active prophage in the n. gonorrhoeae may form the molecular explanation for the observation of the formation of autoplaquing  <cit> . while campbell and coworkers were clearly able to induce gonococci to produce products capable of inhibiting their growth, they were unable to demonstrate the propagation of phage. on the other hand, it is possible that autoplaquing does not result from phage propagation, but rather an alteration in an autoylytic mechanism within the cell, as suggested for autoplaquing in myxococcus  <cit> . it could also be the result of down-regulation of the phage repressors and up-regulation of the phage encoded holin-endolysin lytic system that seem to be encoded by ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> prophages, in response to an environmental change.

to test for the presence of prophage sequences in different gonococcal strains we determined the presence of three different genes present in ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> using a pcr method, with the specificity of the pcr product verified by dna sequence analysis. the results indicate that the prophage sequences detected in strain fa <dig> are not present in all n. gonorrhoeae strains. although, the specific pcr products encoding the large terminase subunits of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> were formed using the chromosomal dna from fa <dig>  ms <dig>  and wr <dig>  the dna encoding the holin gene  was not detected in  <dig> and wr <dig>  similarly, we were unable to detect the presence of the dna sequences representing phages ngoΦ3-ngoΦΦ <dig> in strains as wr <dig> or  <dig>  however, the lack of corresponding pcr products or very low amount of product formation, as in case of strain wr <dig> and  <dig> the dna encoding holin gene could be due to the differences in the dna sequence encoding the genes in particular strains, thus changing the formation of the hybrids between primers and template dna used for pcr reaction and the chromosomal dna.

presence of the prophage sequences in the bacterial genomes may have a profound effect on the pathogenicity of the host cell  as well as on the population fitness  <cit> . over time, a number of toxin genes have been found to be phage-encoded and it has become clear that toxin genes are only a part of diverse group of virulence factors encoded by bacteriophages  <cit> . we do not know whether any of the identified prophage genes of n. gonorrhoeae can be recognized as encoding bacterial toxins. on the other hand the properties of the ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> genes encoding putative repressors could have a profound effect on the fitness of n. gonorrhoeae strains. in e. coli the expression of the λ repressor inhibits the growth of cells in energy-poor environments, probably as an adaptive response to a host predation system  <cit> . we have shown that when e. coli is grown on a rich lb medium, the bacteria that express the repressor grows poorly and that induction of these genes inhibits of growth of cells, with high level of induction leading to cell death. this effect can be manifested by acting through the influence on the expression of different genes. the repressor of ngoΦ <dig> seems to inhibit the expression of the λ phage since even very low level of expression blocks the development of λ particles. these results suggest the tight control of genes encoding these repressors that would allow only very low levels of these proteins. the need for tight control of prophage gene expression is also evident from the activity of the ngo <dig> encoding the holin. the activity of the gene has to be tightly controlled otherwise it is lethal for the cells and will results in the cell death.

among different types of bacterial toxins that are phage encoded are the r- and f-type pyocins produced by p. aeruginosa. pyocins are derived from a common ancestral origin with p <dig> phage and the λ phage respectively  <cit> . the gene organization of the r <dig> and f <dig> pyocins suggest that they are phage tails that have evolutionarily specialized to become bacteriocins. while the data presented in this paper do not show directly that these prophage sequences act as this type of toxin, the genes of ngoΦ <dig> encoding mainly the phage tail structural proteins could play such role.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of bacteriophage production by the gonococcus. their role in pathogenicity is not known and has to be understood. the activity of the repressors on the chromosomal gene activity implies strict control of the level of their production. the ability to manipulate this level could be a potential method by which bacteria regulate their growth in the human body.
