BACKGROUND
the excision of introns from pre-mrna is catalysed by the spliceosome, a macromolecular machine consisting of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles  and a large number of non-snrnp proteins  <cit> . spliceosome assembly proceeds via the step-wise recruitment of u <dig> snrnp, u <dig> snrnp, and u4/u6·u <dig> tri-snrnp on a pre-mrna as well as multiple rearrangements between the spliceosomal components  <cit> . after splicing catalysis, the spliceosome dissociates into its snrnp subunits, which take part in ensuing rounds of splicing.

both spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation  <cit> . the best studied targets for phosphorylation are members of the sr family of splicing factors, which contain domains rich in arg/ser dipeptides  <cit> . several kinases phosphorylate these rs domains and modulate interaction of sr proteins with other proteins during spliceosome assembly  <cit> . in addition, phosphorylation affects the intranuclear distribution of splicing factors and alternative splice site selection  <cit> .

the only non-sr component of the spliceosome known to be phosphorylated during splicing catalysis is sf3b <dig> , one of the subunits of the u <dig> snrnp-associated complex sf3b  <cit> . sf3b <dig> is positioned at the spliceosome catalytic center and contacts pre-mrna on both sides of the branch site  <cit> . phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> appears to be functionally important in the basic splicing reaction as it is detected only in functional spliceosomes and occurs concomitant with splicing catalysis  <cit> . the n-terminal part of sf3b <dig> contains abundant thr-pro dipeptides motifs which are potential phosphorylation sites of proline-directed kinases like the cyclin-dependent kinases . indeed, cyclin e/cdk <dig> has been shown to phosphorylate sf3b <dig> in vitro and to be associated with the u <dig> snrnp complex in vivo  <cit> .

we have recently identified several splicing factors, including sf3b <dig>  as substrates of the protein kinase dyrk1a  <cit> . dyrk1a is a nuclear protein kinase that has been localised to the splicing factor compartment  <cit> . furthermore, we have previously characterised dyrk1a as a kinase that targets serine/threonine followed by a proline residue  <cit> .

here we report that dyrk1a efficiently phosphorylates sf3b <dig> within the tp-rich domain at several sites that are also phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in cos- <dig> cells. one of these sites, thr <dig>  was identified as the residue predominantly phosphorylated by dyrk1a in vitro and as a major phosphorylation site of sf3b <dig> in vivo.

RESULTS
sf3b <dig> is a high affinity in vitro substrate of dyrk1a
we have recently identified sf3b <dig> as an in vitro substrate of dyrk1a by screening of a cdna expression library from human fetal brain  <cit> . in order to further characterise sf3b <dig> as a substrate of dyrk1a, we performed a kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of his6-sf3b1304– <dig>  the fusion protein produced from the library clone, by gst-dyrk1a-Δc. the c-terminally deleted mutant of gst-dyrk1a was used for in vitro-kinase assays since this construct exhibits the same substrate specificity but is more active than wild type gst-dyrk1a  <cit> . the km value obtained for total phosphate incorporation into the substrate was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  μm , characterising sf3b <dig> as a high affinity substrate of dyrk1a. a representative experiment is shown below in fig. 1a. notably, his6-sf3b1304– <dig> contains  <dig> thr-pro dipeptide motifs  which are potential target sites for dyrk1a.

phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> by dyrk1a in cos- <dig> cells
in order to assess whether dyrk1a phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vivo we co-transfected cos- <dig> cells with expression plasmids for gfp-sf3b1-nt and gfp-dyrk1a. assuming that dyrk1a may phosphorylate one ore more of the thr-pro dipeptides, we took advantage of a commercially available antibody which recognises phosphothreonine c-terminally flanked by proline  to detect phosphorylation of sf3b <dig>  this antibody detected two bands in the immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing gfp-sf3b1-nt, of which the lower one  also reacted with the gfp-specific antibody . the difference from the calculated molecular weight  is possibly due to post-translational modifications. as shown in fig. 2c, both bands were eliminated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. furthermore, the upper band was also found after immunoprecipitation with an sf3b1-specific antibody, but not in untransfected cells . thus, this band most likely represents a highly phosphorylated form of gfp-sf3b1-nt which is present in too low amounts to be detected by the gfp-specific antibody . co-transfection of dyrk1a caused a very pronounced and dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of sf3b1-nt  , strongly suggesting that dyrk1a phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in cos- <dig> cells. this effect required low amounts of gfp-dyrk1a compared with its substrate gfp-sf3b1-nt, as evidenced by the direct comparison of gfp-immunoreactivity .

to test the specificity of this reaction, we compared the effects of gfp-clk <dig> and gfp-dyrk1a on the phosphorylation of sf3b1-nt. protein kinases of the clk family are related with the dyrk family and also phosphorylate splicing factors  <cit> . as a further control, we used gfp-dyrk1a-k188r which carries a point mutation in the atp binding site and exhibits greatly reduced catalytic activity . as shown in fig. 2b, co-expression of gfp-clk <dig> failed to induce phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> as compared to gfp alone. as shown by immunodetection with the gfp-specific antibody, gfp-clk <dig> was expressed at similar levels as wild type gfp-dyrk1a . immunocomplex kinase assays with myelin basic protein as substrate confirmed that gfp-clk <dig> was an active protein kinase when expressed in cos- <dig> cells . unexpectedly, co-expression of dyrk1a-k188r significantly enhanced phosphorylation of sf3b1-nt, although the effect was much weaker than that of the wild type kinase . the result that a mutant of dyrk1a with reduced activity , but not the related kinase clk <dig>  enhanced threonine phosphorylation of sf3b1-nt is evidence of the specificity of this reaction.

comparison of the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> by dyrk1a and cyclin e/cdk2
sf3b <dig> is phosphorylated concomitant with or just after catalytic step one of the splicing reaction  <cit> . the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation during splicing catalysis has not been characterised to date, but seghezzi et al.  <cit>  have identified sf3b <dig> as a potential target of cyclin e/cdk <dig> complexes. in order to compare the phosphorylation of sf3b1-nt-his <dig> by dyrk1a and cyclin e/cdk <dig>  we performed a preliminary kinetic analysis of both reactions by measuring the velocities of phosphate incorporation at two different substrate concentrations . the approximate km values calculated from the results shown in fig.  <dig> are very similar for both kinases  and indicate that both kinases have a high affinity for sf3b <dig> 

to answer the question whether both kinases target the same phosphorylation site in sf3b <dig>  we generated phosphopeptide fingerprints. sf3b1-nt-his <dig> was phosphorylated by either gst-dyrk1a-Δc or cyclin e/cdk <dig> in vitro, and tryptic peptides of sf3b1-nt were analysed by two-dimensional peptide mapping. the pattern of phosphopeptides derived from dyrk1a-labelled sf3b <dig>  differed completely from the pattern obtained by cyclin e/cdk <dig> , and mixing of the peptides from both experiments revealed no detectable comigration of phosphopeptides . this result indicates that both kinases phosphorylate different sites in sf3b <dig> 

dyrk1a phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro on physiologically relevant sites
next we asked whether the phosphorylation pattern of sf3b <dig> in vivo better matches the in vitro-pattern obtained with dyrk1a or with cyclin e/cdk <dig>  cos- <dig> cells were transfected with pegfp-sf3b1-nt and metabolically labelled by incubation with 32p-orthophosphate. phosphopeptide mapping of the immunoprecipitated gfp-sf3b1-nt fusion protein showed that the in vivo-phosphorylation pattern  strikingly resembled the phosphorylation pattern obtained by in vitro-phosphorylation with dyrk1a . six of the spots on the in vivo-map matched phosphopeptides generated by dyrk1a in vitro and comigrated in the map of a mixed sample , strongly suggesting that the phosphopeptides generated in vitro by dyrk1a are identical with those generated in vivo. unlike in vitro, however, spot  <dig> was much more intense than spot  <dig>  a possible explanation for this difference is a superposition of signals derived from spot  <dig> and a comigrating phosphopeptide  that is phosphorylated in vivo by a kinase other than dyrk1a . no match was detectable between the cyclin e/cdk <dig> phosphopeptide map and the in vivo map . this result provides evidence that the major part of the phosphorylation within the thr-pro-rich domain of sf3b <dig> is catalysed by dyrk1a or a related kinase with similar substrate specificity. however, it cannot be excluded that relevant cdk <dig> sites escaped detection because phosphopeptides were lost during purification or were poorly soluble in the running buffers.

identification of sf3b <dig> phosphorylation sites
his6-sf3b1304– <dig> was phosphorylated with gst-dyrk1a in vitro and tryptic peptides were analysed for phosphorylation by tandem mass spectrometry . two phosphorylated peptides were identified:  vlpppagyvpirtpar, containing thr <dig>  as the phosphoamino acid; the phosphorylated residue completely inhibited tryptic cleavage at the preceding arg whereas in an unphosphorylated sample, this cleavage occurred freely.  kltatptplggmtgfhmqtedr . ms <dig> and ms <dig> analysis of this peptide indicated that the phosphorylation was confined to either of the first two threonines of the peptide  but from the data the labelled residue could not be distinguished. this was because the predicted fragment ions needed to resolve this question laid beyond the dynamic range of the ion-trap instrument. attempts to examine smaller ms <dig> ions further by ms <dig> to gain access to this region were unproductive, as were secondary digest attempts with chymotrypsin. we considered thr <dig> the more likely target because dyrk1a is a proline-directed kinase. therefore we prepared alanine mutants of thr <dig> and thr <dig> by site directed mutagenesis of sf3b1-nt. in addition, thr <dig> and thr <dig> were mutated because the surrounding sequences of both threonines  matched known target sequences of dyrk1a .

the mutant proteins were phosphorylated with gst-dyrk1a-Δc in vitro and analysed by peptide mapping. mutation of thr <dig> resulted in the loss of the two most prominent spots , indicating that thr <dig> is the major phosphorylation site for dyrk1a. the existence of two different phosphopeptides containing thr <dig> can be explained by incomplete tryptic cleavage as the ms analysis showed this peptide to exist with and without the lysine at the n-terminus. such ragged n- or c-termini can be expected when an xrkx sequence is cleaved by trypsin. the absence of one spot in the phosphopeptide map of the t273a mutant identified thr <dig> as one of the minor in-vitro phosphorylation sites of dyrk1a . the mutants t426a and t303a yielded the same pattern of spots as the wild type protein . the failure to detect the vlpppagyvpirtpar phosphopeptide containing thr <dig>  which was identified as a phosphorylated residue by ms, may be due to poor solubility of this peptide under the conditions applied.

next we asked whether thr <dig> and thr <dig> are in vivo phosphorylation sites of sf3b <dig>  the respective point mutants of gfp-sf3b1-nt were metabolically labelled in cos- <dig> cells and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. analysis of sf3b1-nt-t273a did not reveal differences between the wild type and the mutated protein . in contrast, one of the major phosphopeptides  was absent in the map of gfp-sf3b1-nt-t434a as compared to the wild type protein . this result confirms our conclusion that spot  <dig> represents the same phosphopeptide in the in vitro and the in vivo-maps . we assume that the absence of the other peptide  is masked by a comigrating phosphopeptide . spot x is lacking in sf3b1-nt-t434a after phosphorylation by dyrk1a in vitro, hence this phosphopeptide appears to harbour the only major phosphorylation site not recognised by dyrk1a. these data indicate that thr <dig> in sf3b <dig> is phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in cos- <dig> cells.

overexpression of dyrk1a increases phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> at in vivo-phosphorylation sites
as shown in fig. 2a, overexpression of dyrk1a increases the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> in cos- <dig> cells. to investigate whether dyrk1a targets the same sites that are already phosphorylated in vivo, we compared the phosphopeptide map of gfp-sf3b1-nt phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in cos- <dig> cells with the phosphopeptides obtained after cotransfection of gfp-dyrk1a. as shown in fig.  <dig>  intensities of at least five peptides  increased upon coexpression of gfp-dyrk1a relative to spot x/ <dig>  it should be noted that the comparison with spot x/ <dig>  which includes the dyrk1a-phosphorylated spot  <dig>  underestimates the degree of the increase caused by cotransfection of dyrk1a. in addition, three new spots appeared that were not detectable when sf3b <dig> was labelled without coexpression of dyrk1a . this result demonstrates that dyrk1a can phosphorylate other residues in addition to thr <dig> that are endogenous phosphorylation sites.

phosphorylation of thr <dig> in endogenous sf3b1
in order to facilitate detection of phosphorylated thr <dig>  we raised a polyclonal antiserum against a peptide comprising residues 429– <dig> of sf3b <dig>  phosphorylated at thr <dig>  the affinity-purified antibody recognised wild type sf3b1-nt-his <dig> after in vitro-phosphorylation by dyrk1a, but not the unphosphorylated protein or sf3b1-nt-his6-t434a . in contrast, the commercial pthrpro-specific antibody also bound to other phosphorylated thrpro motifs in the t434a mutant of sf3b <dig>  this result shows that the pt434-directed antibody exhibits high specificity for this phosphorylation site in sf3b <dig> 

the anti-pt <dig> antibody was then used to study the phosphorylation of thr <dig> in transfected cos- <dig> cells. to assess the specificity of the reaction, several nuclear protein kinases were tested in parallel with dyrk1a for their capacity to enhance phosphorylation of thr <dig> in gfp-sf3b1-nt. dyrk1b is the kinase most closely related to dyrk1a . hipk <dig>  was selected as a more distant member of the dyrk family   <cit> , and clk <dig> is a kinase known to phosphorylate splicing factors . as shown in fig. 7b, the pthr434-specific antibody detected sf3b1-nt in cells that did not overexpress dyrk1a . this result is consistent with the labelling of spots  <dig> and  <dig> by endogenous kinases in cos- <dig> cells . signal intensity was dose-dependently enhanced by co-expression of dyrk1a or dyrk1b but not dyrk1a-k188r. sf3b1-t434a  was not recognised by the antibody, confirming that the antibody was indeed specific for phosphothr <dig>  notably, co-expression of hipk <dig>  but not clk <dig>  also resulted in an increased phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b1-nt. a second band  could also be identified as a form of sf3b1-nt because of its absence in cells transfected with sf3b1-nt-t434a. as noted above , it is likely that this band represents a posttranslationally modified form of the protein.

in addition to the recombinant sf3b1-nt protein, the anti-pt <dig> antibody labelled a band with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda that was only detectable in lysates of cells overexpressing catalytically active dyrk1a or dyrk1b. this band co-migrated with the endogenous sf3b <dig> protein as identified by a commercially available antibody. as shown in fig. 7c, the 150-kda band was also detected in a nuclear protein fraction purified from dyrk1a-overexpressing cos- <dig>  further supporting the identification as sf3b <dig>  these data provide evidence that dyrk1a and dyrk1b can phosphorylate the full length, endogenous sf3b <dig> protein in intact cells. in contrast, overexpression of hipk <dig> did not enhance phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b <dig>  suggesting that this kinase cannot phosphorylate the endogenous protein in the spliceosome.

phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> by endogenous dyrk1a
in order to assess the role of endogenous dyrk1a in the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig>  we constructed two plasmids expressing small hairpin rna  for specific downregulation of human dyrk1a. the target sequences were carefully selected to avoid potential effects on dyrk1b mrna. as shown in fig. 8a, transient transfection of either one of the shrna constructs efficiently reduced the level of gfp-dyrk1a, suggesting that they should also downregulate endogenous dyrk1a which is expressed at much lower levels. next we determined the effect of the shrna constructs on the phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b1-nt in two different human cell lines . transient transfection of either construct resulted in a marked reduction of thr <dig> phosphorylation, indicating that dyrk1a is the major thr <dig> kinase in hek193t cells and in hepg <dig> cells.

discussion
the splicing factor sf3b is an integral part of u <dig> snrnp and plays an essential role during spliceosome assembly and recognition of the intron's branch point. one of the components of sf3b, sf3b <dig>  is known to be reversibly phosphorylated during splicing catalysis  <cit> , suggesting that protein kinases play a role in the regulation of splicing. previous studies have shown that cyclin e/cdk <dig> complexes associate with spliceosomal proteins in vivo, and that cdk <dig> phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro  <cit> . here we provide evidence that the protein kinase dyrk1a phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro and in vivo.

the n-terminal part of sf3b <dig> harbours a large number of thr/pro dipeptide motifs within a 240-amino acid region preceding the carboxyterminal repeat domain . both dyrk1a and cdk <dig> are proline-directed kinases, i.e. they phosphorylate serine or threonine residues followed by a proline residue  <cit> . it has been shown that cyclin e/cdk <dig> phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro at multiple sites within the tp-rich domain  <cit> . here we demonstrate that sf3b <dig> is phosphorylated by dyrk1a and cyclin e/cdk <dig> in vitro with similarly high affinity, but at different sites. strikingly, the majority of the in vivo-phosphorylation sites within the n-terminal domain of sf3b <dig> corresponded to sites phosphorylated by dyrk1a in vitro, and overexpression of dyrk1a also enhanced the labelling of these phosphopeptides in vivo. importantly, overexpression of dyrk1a resulted in the increased phosphorylation of thr <dig> in endogenous sf3b <dig>  indicating that enzyme and substrate come into contact in living cells. however, in contrast to cyclin e/cdk <dig>  dyrk1a does not appear to be stably associated with sf3b <dig> as we failed to detect the interaction in pulldown assays .

our conclusion that dyrk1a is the major sf3b <dig> kinase in asynchronously growing cos- <dig> cells is not in contradiction to previous reports that cdk <dig> phosphorylates sf3b <dig>  <cit>  but rather complements these studies. seghezzi et al. reported that only about 30% of the sf3b1-phosphorylating activity in immunoprecipitated sf3b <dig> complexes was inhibited by the cdk inhibitor p <dig>  leading the authors to suggest "the existence of other kinases in the  complex"  <cit> . boudrez et al.  <cit>  also observed that sf3b <dig> kinase activity in lysates from cos- <dig> cells was only partially suppressed by the cdk inhibitor roscovitine. it is well possible that the relative contribution of different kinases to phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> varies in different experimental systems . in our in vivo-phosphopeptide maps, no spot corresponded to a site also phosphorylated by cyclin e/cdk <dig> in vitro, indicating that cdk <dig> did not contribute detectably to phosphate incorporation into sf3b <dig> under these conditions. in contrast,  <dig> phosphopeptides matched spots that were obtained after phosphorylation with dyrk1a in vitro, indicating that dyrk1a or another protein kinase with similar substrate specificity, e.g. dyrk1b  <cit> , catalyses the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> in cos- <dig> cells at multiple sites. overexpression of dyrk1b caused indeed an increase in the phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b <dig>  other members of the dyrk family, dyrk <dig> and dyrk <dig>  are primarily localised in the cytosol  <cit>  and are thus unlikely to phosphorylate sf3b <dig>  the proposed role of dyrk1a as a regulator of an essential splicing factor is in agreement with its ubiquitous expression  <cit> , the evolutionary conservation of dyrk kinases throughout the eukaryotic kingdoms, and the embryonic lethality of mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the dyrk1a gene  <cit> . in contrast, dyrk1b has a more restricted pattern of expression, and dyrk1b deficient mice are viable . further studies will be necessary to reveal the roles of dyrk1a and dyrk1b in splicing.

our experiments do not formally exclude the possibility that another nuclear kinase produces the phosphorylation pattern observed in cos- <dig> cells. we have tested hipk <dig> as a dyrk-related kinase and found that this kinase was indeed able to phosphorylate thr <dig> in gfp-sf3b1-nt. however, overexpression of hipk <dig> did not cause phosphorylation of thr <dig> in endogenous sf3b <dig>  making it unlikely that this kinase targets sf3b <dig> in vivo. moreover, downregulation of dyrk1a by rna interference led to a marked reduction of thr <dig> phosphorylation in hek293t and in hepg <dig> cells, providing evidence that in these cell lines dyrk1a is the major kinase that targets this phosphorylation site. it should be noted that one predominant in vivo-phosphopeptide  was neither labelled by dyrk1a nor by cdk <dig> in vitro, providing evidence that at least one more kinase phosphorylates sf3b <dig> 

the present data identify thr <dig> as the major phosphorylation site of dyrk1a in sf3b <dig>  this site does not exactly match the consensus recognition site for dyrk1a as previously determined in peptide assays  <cit>  since no arginine is present at position - <dig> or - <dig> relative to the phosphorylation site. however, in vitro-assays with a peptide mimicking the sequence context of thr <dig> showed that this target sequence is similarly well recognised as a peptide designed according to the consensus phosphorylation sequence for dyrk1a .

at present we can only speculate on the effects of the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig>  protein-protein interactions of sf3b <dig> with u2af35/ <dig>  the sf3b component p <dig>  and nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase  <dig>  have been mapped to the tp-rich domain  <cit> . nipp <dig> contains a phosphothreonine-binding forkhead-associated  domain, and the binding to nipp <dig> has been shown to depend on the phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> by cyclin/cdk complexes  <cit> . coexpression of dyrk1a failed to alter the binding of sf3b1-nt to nipp <dig> in pulldown assays , most likely because cdks and dyrk1a phosphorylate different sites within sf3b <dig>  it should also be noted that thr <dig> is located at the c-terminal end of the tp-rich domain and was absent in some of the constructs to which protein interactions had been mapped in the studies mentioned above. the location of thr <dig> in the hinge region between the tp-rich domain and the c-terminal domain makes it tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of this residue may regulate the conformational changes of sf3b that have been proposed to be required for binding of the rna  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present data indicate that dyrk1a and/or dyrk1b phosphorylate specific threonine residues within the tp-rich domain of the spliceosomal protein sf3b <dig>  phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> has previously been shown to be increased during splicing catalysis  <cit>  and in mitosis  <cit> . further work will be necessary to reveal the role of dyrk-related kinases under these conditions and which effects they may have on the function of the spliceosome.
