BACKGROUND
the mads-box family of transcription factors is present in all eukaryotic genomes analyzed so far, although with higher number of gene members in plant genomes than in other kingdoms. plant mads-box genes were initially identified as regulators of flower development but later work showed that they control all major aspects of the life of land plants  <cit> . this family of transcription factors is defined by the presence of a conserved domain, the mads-box, in the n-terminal region, involved in dna binding and dimerization with other mads-box proteins. ancestral mads-box gene duplication predating divergence of plants and animals separated the two main lineages, type i and type ii  <cit> , but the presence of around  <dig> genes in the genomes of angiosperm species suggest that they have considerably expanded in plants  <cit> . type ii group genes include mef2-like genes of animals and yeast and mikc-type genes only found in plants. mikc-type genes received this name because, apart from the mads  domain, they contain three additional conserved domains, the weakly conserved intervening  domain, the conserved keratin-like  domain and the highly variable c-terminal  domain  <cit>  where the latter usually contains conserved subfamily-specific sequence motifs  <cit> . the i domain is responsible for specificity in the formation of dna-binding dimers, the k domain mediates dimerization and the c domain functions in transcriptional activation and formation of higher order protein complexes. mikc-type genes have been further divided in two subgroups, mikcc and mikc* based on divergence at the i and k domains and on exon-intron structure  <cit> . type i group genes show a simpler gene structure. they are shorter, generally encoding a single exon and lack the k domain.

mikcc-type genes were initially identified as floral organ identity genes in antirrhinum majus and arabidopsis thaliana. further genetic and molecular analyses grouped their biological functions in flower organogenesis into five classes: a, b, c, d and e, which are required, in different combinations, to specify the identity of sepals , petals , stamens , carpels  and ovules . in arabidopsis, genes belonging to these functional classes were apetala <dig>  in class a, pistilata  and apetala <dig>  in class b, agamous  in class c  <cit> , seedstick/ agamous-like  <dig>  and shatterproof  in class d  <cit>  and sepallata  genes in class e  <cit> . mikcc genes in the ag and apetala1/fruitfull  subfamilies also participate in fruit and seed development . other mikcc genes were later identified as involved in different regulatory networks controlling flowering time and flower initiation: flowering locus c , supressor of overexpression of constants  <dig>  and short vegetative phase  are involved in the regulation of flowering transition by the integration of signals from different flowering time regulatory pathways . these genes function as either positive  or negative regulators  of flower meristem identity genes together with other subfamilies such as agl <dig> , agl <dig> and agl <dig> .

the mikc* subgroup  has a small size in all plant species examined so far, ranging from two genes in the basal eudicot  and the basal angiosperm   <cit>  to six genes in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . mikc* structure is very similar to mikcc genes but the k-domain is poorly conserved in its last part and gene structure show an exon duplication in its 5’ region  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of mikc* genes from a broad variety of vascular plants confirm the existence of two clades  previously determined in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mikc* regulatory function depends on the formation of heterodimers between proteins of the s  and p clades . with the exception of agl <dig>  that seems to be involved in late embryo development  <cit>  these genes are crucial for development of the arabidopsis male gametophyte  <cit> . mikc* genes seem to retain a conserved and essential role in gametophyte development during the evolution of land plants  <cit> .

type i genes are very variable in number among flowering plants, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> members  <cit> . in arabidopsis, this group has  <dig> members distributed in three subclasses: mα , mβ  and mγ   <cit> . contrary to the evolution of mikc-type genes, mostly related to genome duplications, type i mads-box genes seem to be predominantly duplicated via segmental duplications. this idea is supported by their proximity in the arabidopsis genome and by their phylogenetic analyses in different species, since species-specific clusters of type i genes have been found in many species  <cit> . expression of type i arabidopsis genes in central cell, antipodal cell and chalazal endosperm of the embryo sac, indicate that they play an important role in female gametophyte and early seed development in  <cit> . type i proteins  <cit>  interact predominantly among them. mα-type proteins preferentially form heterodimers with mβ or mγ-type proteins whereas interactions within the same subclass are rare.

the genome of the pn <dig> grapevine was first established from a 8x assembly  <cit>  and later updated with a 12x assembly available at https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/species/vitis/data-sequences from which a gene annotation  was performed and is available at the orcae platform  <cit> . the mikcc-type genes were previously analyzed within the 8x version  <cit>  and recently the whole mads-box gene family was analyzed on an early annotation version  of the 12x assembly  <cit> . here, we report a thorough, unbiased identification and analysis of the grapevine mads-box gene family. this work does not represent a new characterization of an advanced annotation version but we have detected new genes and curated all their sequences. this work also represents a direct application of the published grapevine nomenclature recommendations  <cit>  on the annotation of a complex gene family.

our analysis has permitted to complete the mikcc-type genes set with the discovery of  <dig> new genes, mainly belonging to the svp, agl <dig>  bsister  and agl <dig> subfamilies, as well as the characterization of the complete set of mikc* and type i mads-box genes of grapevine.

phylogenetic analyses of mikc* and type i mads-box genes within a wide range of plant species have permitted to infer homologies for key genes that could be involved in gametophytes development. furthermore, in silico analysis of gene expression corroborate the expression patterns described for mikcc-type genes and additionally support the results of the phylogenetic analysis of mikc* and type i mads-box genes.

RESULTS
mads-box gene identification, annotation and mapping within the grapevine genome
gene identification and structural annotation
genes that were previously identified as mads-box  <cit>  were used to perform sequence comparison analyses, either against the most up to date gene predictions from cribi v <dig> and v  <dig>  the ncbi refseq  and the vcost  as well as directly against the reference genome sequence to check whether any potential gene could had been missed by these predictions. in this way, we identified  <dig> genome regions that shared homology with at least one of the genes. forty two regions did not contained mads-box genes since there was no mads domain. thirty seven regions had a mads-box domain but deduced genes did not appear to be functional given their truncation or the presence of stop codons inside the sequence . in fifteen of them, the non-functional condition might be due to incomplete sequence data in the assembly or to natural genetic variation within grapevine, with the corresponding gene being functional in another cultivar. finally, a total of  <dig> mads-box genes with a functional structure were identified in the grapevine genome . compared with a previous study  <cit> , performed on the genoscope grapevine annotation v <dig> version,  <dig> new genes were detected. thirty genes were also new when compared to the cribi v <dig> annotation and  <dig> were new with respect to refseq . overall,  <dig> of these genes had never been detected before in any of the automatic gene model predictions.table  <dig> grapevine mads-box genes

gene models were curated using the data collected from gene structure comparisons as well as the available rnaseq data from our laboratory  to validate actually expressed exons. these data, that included unpublished work, were particularly valuable in the present context since they include expression information of reproductive organs that are susceptible to show expression of mads-box genes. this data also allowed evaluating the expression of newly detected genes, not represented in microarray data, by redoing the bioinformatics analysis of original rnaseq data with an updated gff file. gene structure described  <cit>  was confirmed for  <dig> genes. one of them previously allocated to the unknown chromosome was discarded because it already existed on chromosome  <dig>  the structures of  <dig> other genes were curated. data relative to the detection of the mads-box genes in older genome annotations or gene-sets are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

gene nomenclature
to clarify gene nomenclature, we built a phylogenetic tree of the mads-box protein coding genes in grapevine and arabidopsis  as recommended by the super-nomenclature committee for grape gene annotation   <cit> . within type i and type ii mads-box genes,  <dig> grapevine genes correspond to mikcc genes ,  <dig> to mikc* genes ,  <dig> to mα-type i and  <dig> to mγ-type i genes. no mβ-type i genes seem to be present in grapevine . for mikcc genes, when the gene had already been described and the symbol fit the recommendations of the sncgga, the same symbol was conserved. for genes that had not been described before and had an arabidopsis ortholog, arabidopsis gene symbol was used. for the rest of the genes, the symbol was composed of the subfamily symbol and a number or a letter to differentiate the different members. for the mikcc genes previously identified  <cit> , symbols were kept with minor corrections . symbols used in  <cit>  were not kept because they were attributed according to their respective chromosome position, which made no more sense with the inclusion of  <dig> additional genes and because that system was not functional . the new vvisvp-like sequences were designed vvisvps <dig> to  <dig>  following the recommendations of the sncgga, we named the mikc*-subgroup  as madsd; the mα-type i subclass as mads1a and the mγ-type i subclass as mads1g. within the madsd we distinguished three clades, two corresponding to the previously described s and p clades  <cit>  and a third one. consequently gene clades were designed as madsd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the individual genes were discriminated with a letter attributed randomly. within the mads1a we distinguished three clades that were designated as mads1a <dig>  mads1a <dig> and mads1a <dig>  within the mads1g we distinguished also three clades denominated mads1g <dig>  mads1g <dig> and mads1g <dig>  additional nomenclature details will be presented within the phylogenetic analysis.

chromosomal location of grapevine mads-box genes
mads-box genes were located on  <dig> of the  <dig> grapevine chromosomes , although there are still three genes located in the unknown chromosome. the ten new mikcc genes compared to  <cit>  were definitely positioned: vvibs <dig> on chromosome   <dig>  vvisvp <dig>  vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on chr  <dig>  vviagl6b on chr <dig>  vviagl17c, vviagl17d and vvitm8b on chr  <dig>  vviagl17b, vvisvp <dig>  vvisvp <dig> and vvisvps <dig>  vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on chr <dig>  in addition,  <dig> genes located in unknown regions in the previous report were also mapped. as shown in fig.  <dig>  different members of several subfamilies are located in chromosomal regions that might represent paralogous segments resulting from ancestral polyploidization events  <cit> . notably, there are genes from subfamilies svp and agl <dig> located in all  <dig> paralogous regions on chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig>  genes vviag <dig> and vviag <dig> were located on paralogous regions on chr <dig> and  <dig>  subfamilies flc and sep had gene members on paralogous regions of chr <dig> and chr <dig>  the mikc* subgroup  were also found in two paralogous segments on chr <dig> and  <dig>  within the type i, a cluster of the mγ clade  <dig> genes  on a region of chr <dig> was paralog to a region of chr <dig> that contains the mads1g2b gene. the mγ-type i subclass also showed two gene clusters on paralogous regions of chr  <dig>  and chr <dig> .fig.  <dig> chromosomal location of grapevine mads-box genes. links with the same colors between chromosomes show paralogous regions as previously defined  <cit> 



gene structure and phylogenetic analysis of mads-box genes in grapevine
a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine the composition of gene subfamilies, subclassses and clades and to support the establishment of gene nomenclature. coupled with the identification of protein domains and gene exon structure, we validated in grapevine observations described in other species, in terms of exon/intron structures or locus length. our structure curation did not result in contradiction to the conclusions of previous works  <cit>  and gene nomenclature was significantly improved . we also performed an orthology analysis by sequence comparison between grapevine mads-box deduced proteins and proteins from  <dig> plant species retrieved at http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn in order to obtain information about the possible function of those genes . the objective was to identify the sequences that show orthology in a given species with a minimal level of complexity .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree and structure of mads-box proteins in grapevine. the percentage of trees in which the associated genes clustered together is shown next to the branches. exons in orange are in the + strand. exons in blue are in the - strand. * new gene compared to wang et al.  <cit> . underscore: gene sequence was curated

update on mikcc mads-box genes
compared to our previous study we were able to identify  <dig> new mikcc genes. among them, one belonged to the bs subfamily,  <dig> to the agl <dig> subfamily and  <dig> to the agl <dig> subfamily. as described before for mikcc-type ii genes they all included the i, k and c domains in addition to the mads-box. the number of exons was relatively large  and the loci were much longer than type i genes. in addition to those four new genes, we detected one gene,vvitm8b, which appeared related to vvitm8a and  <dig> new gene sequences closely related with the vvisvp subfamily. these genes were called as vvisvps for svp short and were located on chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  . the vvitm8b gene did not fit the mikcc type ii model, it only contained the mads-box and it is unclear whether it is expressed and functional. regarding vvisvps, all but vvisvps <dig>  had only one exon encoding a mads-box followed by a short amino acid sequence of about  <dig> amino acids that was different between vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on one side and vvisvps <dig>  vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on the other side .fig.  <dig> alignment of the grapevine vvisvp and vvisvps protein sequences. vvisvp sequences are shown truncated to the area sharing similarity to the vvisvps



the results of the orthology analyses indicated that svps sequences were not present in the monocot species considered. in addition, for some genes such as vvisvp <dig>  vvipi, vviagl15a  and vvisep <dig>  there was only one detected gene in all the species. interestingly, the new grapevine genes found in the subfamilies bs , agl <dig> , agl <dig>  and tm <dig> , did not showed orthology with other species.

phylogenetic analysis of mikc* and type i mads-box genes in plants
the phylogenetic analysis for mikc* and type i mads-box genes from grapevine and arabidopsis showed many clades of genes that appeared specific to grapevine, thus revealing little information on their possible roles. for this reason, a phylogenetic analysis including mikc* and type i genes from  <dig> other plant species was carried out in order to provide additional information on their evolutionary history and possible function and to identify clades and subclades . additionally, we also performed an orthology analysis for mikc* and type i mads-box genes as described for the mikcc genes .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of mikc* and type i mads-box proteins in plants. green: grapevine deduced proteins. branches without grapevine proteins were collapsed



the mikc* mads-box genes
six members, as in arabidopsis, were detected in the grapevine mikc*subgroup . their gene structure shared with arabidopsis genes the presence of a higher number of exons  compared with mikc c genes , although the total lengths of loci were shorter. two  have an identifiable k domain, but this box could not be detected in the rest either with prosite or pfam . the two clades previously described in vascular plants  <cit>  were also maintained in grapevine. however, we identified a short protein  not belonging to any of them, that only contained the mads-box region followed by five amino acids. clade  <dig>  contained three homologs to agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig>  with madsd1a and madsd1b being the nearest to agl <dig>  clade  <dig> , contained two homologs to arabidopsis agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig>  this clade  <dig> also included agl <dig> that seems to show low homology with several proteins in other species including grapevine . agl <dig> is a short sequence without k-domain and there is no evidence of orthology with madsd2a. grapevine mikc* genes displayed orthology one-to-one with madss in other species , the most consistent were madsd2b which showed one single orthologs in every species except strawberry as well as madsd1a and madsd1c. madsd2a, only showed one-to-one orthology with a poplar protein and madsd3a with papaya protein but had homologs in most analyzed species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the mikc*) mads-box proteins in plants. green: grapevine deduced proteins. pink: arabidopsis deduced proteins



type i mads-box genes
type i genes were characterized by the presence of a single exon. only mads1a3d had three exons and mads1g1d had two, however we cannot exclude that this could be due to incorrect genome assembly. within type i genes, it was hard to find clear orthologies between arabidopsis and grapevine genes, most notably in the mγ subclass . regarding mβ genes, our analysis revealed that this subclass seems to be absent in grapevine.

analysis of the mα-type i genes
three clades could be distinguished in the mα subclass based on phylogeny, mα <dig>  mα <dig> and mα <dig>  these clades showed similarity to the previously defined groups  <cit> .

the mα1clade contained  <dig> grapevine genes  . the clade also included genes from papaya, apple, peach, tomato and arabidopsis . homology with other species was maintained in this clade, although it was weaker with monocots . only mads1a1d and mads1a1g showed monocot homologs. mads1a1g was also the member with most orthologs including monocots, stressing its possible conserved role. several genes from other species shared higher homology with grapevine members of this clade than the homology detected amongst grapevine genes. these results suggest that duplication of some members of this family is relatively old predating species divergence.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the mα-type i proteins in plants. green: grapevine deduced proteins. pink: arabidopsis deduced proteins



the mα <dig> clade grouped all nine grapevine genes in a single subclade with no gene from the other analyzed species . genes from other species were detected in this clade but no other species showed this level of duplication, medicago had three genes and strawberry and soybean had two . consistently with those results, the homology detected with genes from other species was weak . madsa2f, madsa2g and madsa2h were absent in other species and the rest of madsa <dig> only shared homology with soybean, medicago, poplar and papaya. a possible ortholog of madsa2b could only be detected in poplar, which might be a false positive.

within mα <dig> clade, grapevine mads1a <dig> genes generally were distant from each other. a group of three genes  seemed to share similarity with seven eucalyptus genes and a few others from rosacea . the other mα <dig> genes were much more distant in the phylogenetic analysis and appeared unrelated. two other genes , seem to be related with a group of nine tomato genes . mads1a3e was poorly related to any other mα except a gene from orange trees. finally, mads1a3b did not group within the mα subclass in the species analysis . in summary, within the mα <dig>  not much homology was detected between grapevine genes and other species genes appearing in this clade including arabidopsis agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig>  mads1a3a and mads1a3e were the only members for which orthologs one-to-one could be detected in species other than arabidopsis .

analysis of the mγ-type i genes
three clades could be distinguished within the mγ subclass, mγ <dig>  mγ <dig> and mγ <dig>  the mγ <dig> clade contained two groups of grapevine genes . the first group of eight genes was located on chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig>  and on chromosome  <dig> . these genes formed a grapevine-specific group with no clear homology to genes from other species. the second group contained two grapevine genes located on chromosome  <dig>  as well as genes from medicago, soybean and some of the rosaceae species. mads1g1j showed orthology with apple, this was the only homology with other species detected in the mγ <dig> clade .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the mγ-type i proteins in plants. green: grapevine deduced proteins. pink: arabidopsis deduced proteins



within the mγ <dig> clade there was a group of seven grapevine genes, five in chromosome  <dig>  and two on chromosome  <dig>  . these genes had homologs in all the species analyzed but only mads1g2c showed orthology with papaya and monocot-specific genes . the closest genes in the phylogenetic tree correspond to a group of apple genes , which suggests that in both of these fruit species the duplication occurred recently. the mγ <dig> clade also included the mads1g2h grapevine gene located on chromosome  <dig>  which seemed to belong to a group of genes that duplicated and expanded in legumes . mads1g2h was identified as one-to-one ortholog of agl <dig>  one of the best characterized arabidopsis type i genes in this subclass, although agl <dig> appeared in a separated branch in the mγ <dig> clade. in this context, both eucalyptus and cabbage contained homologous genes to agl <dig>  probably due to conservation of this gene function along evolution.

finally, the mγ <dig> clade only contained a single grapevine gene  that was associated with a single gene from melon . no orthologs could be detected for this mγ <dig> grapevine gene.

globally, the large clades for mα <dig> and mγ1-type i grapevine genes seemed to be mostly specific for grapevine. in general, there was very little orthology one-to-one detected for the mikc* and type i mads-box genes with the notable exceptions of madsd2b  and mads1g2h . in addition, mads1a1a, mads1a1g, madsd1a and madsd1c were present in about 50 % of the species analyzed.

expression analysis of mads-box genes
two types of expression analyses were performed. in the first analysis the objective was to construct an atlas of expression of the mads-box genes based on the absolute value of gene expression in public data. the results of this study are presented in fig.  <dig> that displays the data extracted from the published grapevine gene expression atlas  <cit>  and data available in our laboratory from different rnaseq experiments. in addition, we intended to detect expression in the experiments listed in additional file  <dig>  when a gene was clearly expressed in a given tissue a plant ontology  was attributed to the gene and reported in additional file  <dig> and in the orcae database. secondly, we performed a co-expression analysis based on the same original data but using the relative values of expression, centered on the average expression in each platform. the objective here was to determine expression patterns and to identify genes within subfamilies that were following the same pattern and that could be under the same regulatory elements. the results are presented in fig.  <dig>  the original data used are reported in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> expression data of the grapevine mads-box genes per tissues. color represents the absolute intensity value of expression  in each condition. green: the expression cannot be distinguished from the background noise; black: expression was different from the background noise but not enough to attribute a plant ontology; red: gene is expressed. grey: not measured. a nimblegen microarray data b rnaseq data

expression of mikcc genes
expression studies of mikcc confirmed previous results for those genes previously known  <cit> . regarding the new genes found in this study, vvibs <dig> showed a pattern of expression in tendrils and buds, quite different to the expression pattern of vvibs <dig> and vvibs <dig> ; vviagl17d showed a pattern similar to vviagl17b, restricted to seeds and flowers whereas vviagl17c expression was detected in roots, berries, seeds, flowers and rachis; vviagl6b expression was detected in shoot tip, tendril, bud, berry, inflorescence, flowers and reproductive organs in general while vviagl6a expression was more restricted to the reproductive phase.

vvisvps sequences showed specific pattern of expression that is different from the vvisvp genes in grapevine. vvisvps <dig> expression was similar to vvisvp <dig> and vvisvp <dig> but it was neither expressed in reproductive organs nor in seeds. vvisvps <dig> showed expression in vegetative organs but also in berry and petals. vvisvps <dig> expression was detected in leaf, buds but also in berry, flower and pollen. vvisvps <dig> showed expression in the vegetative tissues and flowers and vvisvps <dig> in shoot tip and flowers. no expression was detected for vvitm8b.

expression of mikc* genes
expression patterns for genes in clades  <dig> and  <dig> were partially overlapping. within clade  <dig>  madsd1a was expressed in flower and pollen, madsd1b was expressed in leaf, bud, berry, seed and flower and madsd1c was expressed in leaf, bud, berry, seed, inflorescence and flower. within clade  <dig>  madsd2a showed expression in leaf, root, berry and seed while madsd2b was expressed in bud, berry, seed, stamen and pollen. finally, madsd3a expression was detected in berry and seed.

expression of type i genes
most arabidopsis type i genes showed very little expression that is restricted to very specific cells and tissues and limited time span, such as the female gametophyte or specific cells within the developing seed. transcriptome-wide studies conducted in grapevine have yet to address these tissues since for many of these type i mads-box genes we could not detect proof of expression.

expression of mα-type i genes
most of the mα <dig> clade genes did not show expression over the background noise in the microarrays data to clearly state that they are expressed in any tissue. however, mads1a1a, mads1a1c and mads1a1e seemed to have a slight expression in a few tissues and were considered as expressed. this means that they were qualified as “putative genes” in their description in the orcae database and in additional file  <dig>  as opposed to “hypothetical” for genes with no proof of expression  <cit> . the gene that is conserved among different species, mads1a1g, seemed not expressed either or expression could not be detected. regarding the mα <dig> clade, three genes showed expression in specifics tissues. mads1a2a was allocated to  <dig> plant ontology terms related to vegetative as well as reproductive tissues . mads1a2b was allocated to  <dig> plant ontology terms related to vegetative as well as reproductive tissues. mads1a2i expression was detected in shoot tips and inflorescences. both mads1a2b and mads1a2c seemed to have a light expression and were classified as “putative”. finally, in the mα <dig> clade, only mads1a3e was clearly expressed in leaves and berries whereas mads1a3f and mads1a3g were slightly expressed and were classified as “putative” genes. neither mads1a3a, mads1a3b and mads1a3d, all on chromosome  <dig>  nor mads1a3c were expressed. the closest homologous genes in arabidopsis  were expressed in the embryo and peripheral endosperm  <cit> .

expression of mγ-type i genes
in this subfamily, expression was not detected only for three genes in the first clade , mads1g1a, mads1g1b and mads1g1e. for the rest of the genes, mads1g1c and d seemed weakly expressed. mads1g1f, mads1g1g, mads1g1h and mads1g1j were expressed in leaves . in addition, mads1g1j and mads1g1i were expressed in flowers.

the rest of genes in the mγ <dig> clade showed very low expression and this was only clearly visible for mads1g2a, mads1g2b and mads1g2h in seeds. gene mads1g3a, in clade mγ  <dig>  did not show clear expression in any tissue.

coexpression of mads-box genes and relative expression
several groups of genes present a high level of expression correlation between each other . based on “guilt-by-association” concept, genes with similar expression are likely involved in the same process.

we identified four groups of consecutive co-expressing genes that might be under the expression of the same regulators such as mads1g1f and mads1g1g or mads1g1i and mads1g1j that also coexpressed with mads1g2a. these genes were in a paralogous chromosome segment  <cit> . this was the only occurrence where genes from the same duplicated region  were co-expressed. vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> co-expressed also with mads1a2d. mads1g2a and mads1g2b, they also co-expressed with mads1a1a.

interestingly, in the case of vvisvp <dig> co-expressing with vvisvp <dig> and vvisvp <dig> co-expressing with vvisvps <dig>  they are consecutively located in the following order vvisvp <dig>  vvisvps <dig> in one chromosome and vvisvp <dig> and vvisvp <dig> in another. the  <dig> genes had similar expression, with the exception that vvisvp <dig> and vvisvp <dig> were more abundant in pollen and seed than in other reproductive organs.

other genes belonging to the same subclasses had identical expression, and therefore could have redundant roles. this was the case for vvisoc1a and vvisoc1b; vviap <dig> and vviagl6b as well as vvibs <dig> and vvibs <dig>  when genes showed co-expression only on the basis of available rnaseq data, the results were considered less reliable, since it was based on  <dig> conditions, versus  <dig> for a gene present in all microarrays. this was the case of madsd1a, mads1g2d, mads1g1c and mads1g2f on one side; vvisvps <dig> and mads1g1h; mads1a3f and mads1g2g; mads1g2c, vvipi and mads1a3c, as well as vviful <dig> and mads1a3i. finally, amongst genes that did not belong to the same clade and for which there was enough expression data collected, vvisvp <dig> and vvisoc1c were of interest, beside sharing the same expression pattern, they were strictly expressed in vegetative tissues and not in reproductive tissues. additionally, vvisep <dig>  vviag <dig>  vviag <dig> and vvisep <dig> shared the same expression patterns that are strictly limited to reproductive tissues. none of the mikc* genes were co-expressed with any other mads-box genes .

discussion
we have performed an exhaustive analysis of mads-box genes on the 12x grapevine genome based on the isolation of the complete set of genes identified in pn <dig>  in addition to public functional annotations, we flagged some regions that might represent functional mads-box genes in other areas of the genome. this supposes the identification of  <dig> functional genes what adds  <dig> new genes to previous studies  <cit> . chromosome localization, gene structure, phylogenetic analyses with other sequenced genome species and expression analysis allowed to propose an extended characterization of this gene family in grapevine and to draw hypothesis on the function of the yet undescribed genes.

grapevine mikcc –type ii genes
a total of  <dig> mikcc –type ii genes distributed in  <dig> subfamilies were found in grapevine, representing a similar number to what has been described in other plant species. these numbers include the addition of ten new genes to the previous descriptions of this group. interestingly, we did not found putative one-to-one orthologs for these  <dig> new genes in other plant systems as detected for the remaining mikcc genes in previous analyses  <cit> . grapevine shows a notable expansion of the svp subfamily as has been described in other woody species  <cit> . in addition, the new members in the vvisvp subfamily  showed special features not yet found in any other species. the identification of new genes could result from our more thorough analysis over a 12x genome which, in comparison to automatic annotation methods, permits the isolation of genes with low similarity to other species and not strongly expressed, as automatic method rely on transcript data  and sequences from other species.

the most significant data among the new genes found were the sequences called vvisvps that appeared in the vvisvp subfamily. the mads-box of vvisvps proteins are highly similar to vvisvp and they were named in this way because of this similarity. they also showed similarities with the tomato jointless  <cit>  that controls flower abscission. vvisvps genes are located near vvisvp genes in grapevine. three of these sequences  map linked to vvisvp <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and showed a singular pattern of expression, partially overlapping with the expression of vvisvp genes but also expressed in other tissues. the same happened with sequences vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> which are linked to vvisvp <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  vvisvps genes are however much shorter than vvisvp and jointless. the encoded proteins only contain the mads-box and a short sequence of about  <dig> aminoacids that permits to discriminate vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on one hand and vvisvps <dig>  vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> on the other hand . compared with grapevine vvisvp genes, they seem to lack a large part of the i region but showed homology at the end of the i region and the beginning of the k domain . the conservation of the c-terminal small non-mads-box sequence within the two groups indicates that this region is probably of functional interest. in addition, their specific expression pattern also suggests that these genes are probably functional. short mads-box genes have also been found in other species. notably, one of them seems to be associated with dormancy in leafy spurge  <cit> , whose expression could be in agreement with the expression pattern observed for vvisvps <dig>  vvisvps <dig> and vvisvps <dig> in grapevine. short mads-box proteins as the vvisvps  and with sequence similarities to them were also detected in arabidopsis, prunus persica, ricinus communis, citrus clementina, populus trichocarpa, glycine max, citrus sinensis and witheringia coccoloboides in their respective predicted automatic annotations. vvisvps genes had no homologs in the monocot species considered suggesting that duplication events giving rise to these new genes were rather recent and might actually play a role in dicot-specific developmental mechanisms. their wide range and diversity of expression suggest that those mechanisms are rather diverse and establishment of their biological function will require further studies. the i and k domains are important for dimerization, the k-domain promotes dimerization via forming amphipathic helices, which interact with those of another k-domain-containing protein  <cit> . the i domain influences the specificity of dna-binding dimer formation  <cit> . in vvisvps, i-region is twice shorter than usual, and k-domain consists of 10– <dig> amino acids compared to 70– <dig> amino acids k-domain in mikc proteins , i.e. only 3– <dig> coils are formed instead of 20– <dig> coils in full-length k-domain alfa-helix. the proofs of their expression and their conservation in other species tends to indicate that they are functional, however, whether or not these proteins form complexes with other mads-box proteins is unclear. a similar role could also be proposed for vvitm8b, although the truncated protein only contains the mads-box and the expression of the corresponding gene could not be detected.

regarding vviagl6b, it showed a decreasing level of expression along inflorescence development but increased expression along tendril development  <cit>  suggesting a possible involvement in development of this organ. the expression data  indicate that the vviagl6a probe set in the grapegen array might have been compromised since expression was never detected in this platform, while it is clearly expressed in many tissues. nevertheless its expression seems to be low in tendrils. thus a new function acquired in this subfamily for tendril development was suggested for vviagl6b  <cit> , as was also proposed for other members of the ap1/ful subfamily in grapevine  <cit>  where additional subfamily members also show a differential pattern of tendril expression.

grapevine mikc*–type ii genes
the grapevine genome contained six genes in this group belonging to the two previously defined clades   <cit> , that are typical of euphyllophytes . interestingly, clade  <dig>  that included grapevine madsd <dig> genes, also included agl <dig>  an arabidopsis gene difficult to classify and not assigned to either s or p clades but considered within the mikc*subgroup,  <cit> . madsd2a the closest grapevine gene to agl <dig> in the phylogenetic tree did not show homology to it or to genes from other species with the exception of poplar. this grapevine gene was clearly expressed in heterogeneous tissues indicating a possible ubiquitous role. the other grapevine gene in clade  <dig>  madsd2b, located alone in chromosome  <dig>  corresponds to a single copy in every species except in strawberry and its arabidopsis ortholog is agl <dig>  its abundant and generalized expression is coincident with the expression behavior of agl <dig> according to tair .

in clade  <dig> there were three grapevine genes, madsd1a, madsd1b and madsd1c. madsd1a had a high number of one-to-one orthologs in other species and was expressed in flower and pollen, being a good candidate for having a functional role in pollen development. madsd1b and madsd1c are linked on the same chromosome and have similar patterns of ubiquitous expression suggesting that they could be functionally redundant. arabidopsis genes within this clade  seem to function redundantly in pollen development since their loss has significant effects on pollen performance but only when both agl <dig> and agl <dig> mads-box containing complexes are reduced  <cit> . thus, we could think of a possible equivalent role for the complex  / madsd1a as complexes agl65/agl <dig> or agl65/agl <dig> role in arabidopsis pollen development. this is supported by their expression pattern since although madsd1a and madsd2b/madsd2c have quite different patterns of expression they share the feature of peaking in pollen.

arabidopsis and rice mikc* genes are almost exclusively expressed in pollen  with the exception of the agl <dig> gene which is expressed in embryos and is candidate for regulating aspects of late embryo development  <cit> . however, grapevine mikc*genes are expressed outside male gametophytes with the exception of madsd1a that was only detected in flower and pollen, which could suggest additional biological functions for these genes. similarly, expression of p-clade genes was detected in sporophytic tissues in prunus  <cit> , in the female gametophyte in lycophytes as well as on hermaphrodite gametophytes in the fern ceratopteris  <cit> , suggesting that mikc* genes could also function outside the male gametophyte in other systems. the basal angiosperm eschscholzia  <cit>  contains two mikc*genes highly expressed in pollen with the one belonging to the p clade also expressed in sporophytic tissues. in arabidopsis, heterodimers seems to exist only in pollen  <cit> , suggesting a role of these genes also restricted to male gametophyte development in spite of the expression of the p clade gene. this could be also the case of grapevine with a broad expression of madsd2b but with a more restricted expression for their s putative partners.

finally, clade  <dig> contained a single grapevine gene, madsd3a, which encodes truncated proteins with the mads-box domain followed by five amino acids. madsd3a is expressed in berry and seed. coexpression analysis  did not allow to identify clear potential heterodimers based on gene expression, although madsd3a had similar expression pattern as madsd2a, with high expression in seeds which could suggest a putative role in seed development, as has been found for agl <dig> in arabidopsis. these data indicate that short mads-box genes also exist in the mikc* subgroup as has been observed for the mikcc genes.

grapevine type i mads-box genes
we have identified  <dig> type i mads-box genes in grapevine,  <dig> belonging to mα-type i and  <dig> to mγ-type i genes. our analyses showed that no gene could be classified as mβ in grapevine although a reduced clade of two genes might cover their biological roles. these genes numbers were very similar to those described in arabidopsis with mα  and mγ   <cit> , although arabidopsis displays a large group of mβ genes . type i genes number is variable among plant species without clear homologies within subclasses and this is also the case in grapevine  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of grapevine-specific clades both in the mα and mγ-subclasses with only a few genes having clear homologs in other species. gene clustering on chromosome location for many of these genes is also in agreement with their proposed origin through segmental duplications.

the mα-type i genes
three clades were identified in grapevine mads1a <dig> and mads1a <dig>  that are phylogenetically related and mads1a <dig>  in arabidopsis, the mα type i genes are separated into two groups according to their expression. the first group contains genes distinctly expressed while the genes in the second group are weakly expressed. in the first group, two clades with differential expression pattern were additionally found  <cit> . in grapevine, the first clade, mads1a <dig>  contained the genes showing the highest homology with this first clade of the first group of arabidopsis . this conservation was also observed in other plant systems. this clade in arabidopsis contains genes with a proposed functional role in central cell development, endosperm development and early embryo sac and seed development . the expression detected for mads1a <dig> genes in grapevine is very low, probably due to expression of these genes in few and specific cells, never evaluated in grapevine and during short times along development. no plant ontology was attributed to any genes, but expression higher than the background noise were observed for three genes . the expression of mads1a1a and mads1a1c in berry and first stages of seed development , and mads1a1e in seeds would be in agreement with a role in seed development similarly to what has been proposed for their arabidopsis homologs. out of five of these genes that clustered on chromosome  <dig>  only two might be expressed. this could be a consequence of segmental duplication that can derive in non-functionalization, as has also been observed in arabidopsis and other plant systems. this was one of the few groups of grapevine type i genes that showed clear homology with genes from other plant species , suggesting they might regulate conserved functions during reproductive development.

regarding the second clade of grapevine genes, mads1a <dig>  their expression is generally very low except for two genes that are clearly expressed. both mads1a2a and mads1a <dig> were expressed in a diversity of tissues, senescing leaves, winter buds, post véraison berry tissues, seedling and pollen. in general, mads1a <dig> genes showed only little homology to genes from a few other species . the mads1a <dig> clade do not seem to have any counterpart in arabidopsis and cannot be related to the second group of arabidopsis mα-type i genes composed by genes weakly expressed in the female gametophyte. interestingly, arabidopsis genes belonging to the clade without grapevine counterparts were the ones interacting with mβ genes, a group of genes also missing in grapevine. considering that mβ genes seem to be absent or partially absent in several species , it is tempting to speculate the existence of alternative regulatory mechanisms for the development of the female gametophyte in plants, including grapevine. the third clade of mα-type i genes in grapevine, mads1a <dig>  is phylogenetically related in the species analysis to the second clade of the first group of mα-type i genes of arabidopsis but do not show specific gene homologies. grapevine genes also show reduced homology with other species, with the exception of mads1a3a . in the species analysis, mads1a <dig> genes are in the same clade than the four arabidopsis paralogs agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig> which are expressed in the embryo and the peripheral endosperm  <cit> . we did not detected expression for mads1a3a, mads1a3b, mads1a3c and mads1a3d but mads1a3e was expressed in older tissues  and mads1a3f and mads1a3g only show signs of expression slightly over background noise.

the mγ-type i genes
three clades were distinguished within this subclass, mads1g <dig>  mads1g <dig> and mads1g <dig>  the first clade mads1g <dig> is grapevine-specific . all these grapevine mads-box genes, except mads1g1d, were identified for the first time in this work. thus, there is no microarray data available to analyze their expression. rnaseq experiments detected no expression for mads1g1a, mads1g1b, mads1g1e and only traces for mads1g1d and mads1g1e. by contrast, mads1g1f, mads1g1g and mads1g1h were clearly expressed in shoot tips. more detailed studies will be required to address the possible biological function of this group of genes. genes within the other group, mads1g1i and mads1g1j, were already identified in the grapevine genome. these two genes are linked in the genome and co-expressed with mads1g2a appearing to be flower-specific. mads1g1j is also the only gene displaying homology with genes in other species .

although no gene could be classified as mβ-type i in grapevine, agl <dig> and agl <dig>  a subgroup of arabidopsis mβ-type i genes were located closely to the mads1g <dig> clade in the phylogenetic tree . agl <dig> was expressed during early megagametogenesis and agl <dig> in central cell  <cit> . although these organs and cell types were not analyzed here, expression of mads1g1i and mads1g1j in flowers could suggest that they might fulfill the role of the mβ-type i subclass in grapevine.

in the second clade  there was a group of genes, mads1g2a to mads1g2g, clustering together and a single gene, mads1g2h, with homology to the arabidopsis genes belonging to the agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig> group of expression, all involved in endosperm development. mγ-type i genes are preferentially expressed in the developing seed in arabidopsis, whereas agl <dig> is predominantly expressed in the central cell  <cit> . multiple mads1g <dig> genes have agl <dig> as best match with mads1g2h having the highest homology . mads1g2h also had one-to-one orthologs in all dicot species analyzed, but none in monocots. agl <dig> together with agl <dig>  are involved in central cell formation in the arabidopsis embryo sac  <cit> . interestingly, no grapevine homologs were identified for agl <dig> , functionally characterized and involved together with agl <dig> in endosperm development. the group of grapevine mads1g2a to mads1g2g genes had an expression pattern restricted to seed in several cases although other genes were expressed in earliest reproductive stages . in addition, the putative agl <dig> homolog mads1g2h, was expressed in post-harvest berry and seed.

the third clade  contained a single mγ gene, mads1g3a, which belonged to a clade with arabidopsis genes agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig>  mads1g3a did not share homology with any gene in the analyzed species and was slightly expressed in seeds. mads1g3a might be the gene fulfilling the role of these arabidopsis genes whose biological roles were described as redundant in embryo development  <cit> .

in summary, grapevine type i genes include a few conserved members that could be crucial for embryo and endosperm development in parallel to the role of arabidopsis agl <dig> the putative ortholog of mads1g2h and agl <dig> and agl <dig>  putative orthologs of mads1a <dig> clade genes. processes related to central cell, embryo and endosperm development could be conserved under the same regulatory networks. regarding the development of the female gametophyte, which in arabidopsis is controlled by interaction between the second group of arabidopsis mα-type i genes and the mβ–type i genes, grapevine genes are less conserved since no homologous to those mα-genes were identified and mβ genes might be absent or only represented by two members in grapevine.

CONCLUSIONS
our identification of mads box proteins in the grapevine genome revealed, for this specific gene family at least, that automatic approaches were limited in gene prediction since most of type i genes had not been identified previously. our genomic analysis of mads-box genes in grapevine allowed the discovery of genes belonging to the bs, agl <dig>  agl <dig> and tm <dig> subfamilies that had no homologs in other plant species. in addition, five sequences related to the vvisvp subfamily, named as vvisvps could represent a new type of mads-box genes not yet characterized in other plant systems.

characterization of the mikc*-subgroup confirm the proposed existence of s and p clades genes although the grapevine genome seems to have less redundancy in the p clade with only two members. expression of these grapevine genes was detected in the male gametophyte but also in other tissues which support additional roles outside pollen development.

we have extensively described grapevine type i genes for the first time. we identified two subclades of mα-type i and three subclades of mγ-type i genes, but no genes could be clearly classified as mβ in grapevine. phylogenetic analysis among species showed that only few members of type i genes have clear homologs in other plant species and that grapevine-specific clades appeared both in the mα and mγ-subclasses. comparing with arabidopsis and other species type-i genes, we observed conservation of genes that could be crucial for development of central cell, embryo and endosperm. further functional analysis will be required to understand the biological role of this complex gene family in grapevine.
