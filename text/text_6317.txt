BACKGROUND
life is not possible without the exchange of substances and information between cells, therefore macro- and micro-organisms have developed efficient transport systems to control the molecular interaction processes within the colonized environment. transportation of many molecules through the cell semipermeable membrane against a concentration gradient requires the use of energy that can be provided, for instance, by atp hydrolysis. plants, due to their sessile status, have evolved a very complex movement system for molecules, in which proteins belonging to the abc superfamily play a major role  <cit> .

atp-binding cassette  superfamily represents one of the largest protein group within the kingdoms of archaea, eubacteria and eukarya. proteins belonging to this superfamily are atp powered transporters able to translocate substrates across cellular membranes. the transported molecules, even if secreted from the same abc protein, may be extremely different, both in terms of chemistry and structure  <cit> .

the canonical architecture of abc transporters comprises two transmembrane domains  and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains , also known as atp-binding cassettes. the structural organisation of the four domains is a dimer of dimers, which can deploy as single polypeptides, or as multisubunit oligomers, reflecting ancient gene duplication events and fusions of the cytosolic catalytic with the membrane-spanning domains  <cit> . usually intracytosolic loops are present as extensions of tmds and function as the interface between the nbds and tmds  <cit> . the nbd contains several highly conserved motifs, including the walker a and b sequences, the abc signature motif, the h loop and the q loop  <cit> .

the abc signature sgx 3x) is situated between the two walker boxes  <cit> , and is the hallmark that distinguish abc transporters from other atp binding proteins.

due to the complexity and dimension of abc protein superfamily, a precise classification of all the subfamilies is necessary. the proposed categorisations are various. the transporter classification  system, based on incorporation of both functional and phylogenetic information, includes  <dig> subfamilies of abc exporters and  <dig> of abc importers . based on sequence comparison,  <cit>  three classes of abc systems, that were probably present in the last common ancestor of archaea, bacteria and eukarya, have been proposed: class  <dig> comprises transporters with fused tmds and nbds ; class  <dig> includes non-transporter abcs lacking tmds; class  <dig>  includes mainly transporters with nbds and tmds formed by separate polypeptide chains , and some bacterial exporters.

plant genomes encode for a high number of abc proteins with more than  <dig> found in both arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa  <cit> . the currently used plant abc protein classification systems are mainly based on phylogenetic information, domain arrangement or similarities/structure comparison with human and microbial prototypes . sanchez-fernandez et al.  <cit>  combined information from different classification systems and identified  <dig> plant subfamilies, including also membrane-bound abcs that consist only of those containing soluble nbd domains. in order to unify plant and animal abc naming systems, the human genome organization  proposed a new subfamily designation for vertebrate and invertebrate abc communities, which is now widely used  <cit> . this system originally comprised seven abc subfamilies  based on sequence homology, phylogenetic relationships and domain organization. subsequently, following a more recent inventory of drosophila and fish abc proteins, an additional subfamily   has been defined. for plants, a further subfamily  has been created to incorporate ‘prokaryotic’- type abcs that are not present in many animal genomes  <cit> . subfamilies abca, abcb, abcc and abcd contain “forward orientation” tmd-nbd transporters. subfamilies abcg and abch, instead, are characterized by a “reverse organization” domain nbd-tmd. subfamilies e and f show only two domains nbd and thus they are labelled as “soluble”. these proteins are not transporters but their nbds clearly cluster with those of other abc proteins.

plant genome sequences availability is growing fast, resulting in an almost completely unexplored repository. the aim of the present work was to list, compare and phylogenetically classify the abc proteins of selected vascular plant genomes , the green alga volvox carteri and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, in order to facilitate future studies on abc genes and proteins. identification and classification were based on the work by verrier and collaborators  <cit> . further, a selection pressure study and a customized gene duplication analysis, to identify recent duplication events in vascular plant genomes, have been accomplished. finally, an expression profile overview of abc superfamily to detect tissue-specific transporter activation in tomato has been performed as a proof of concept and reported.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of putative abc proteins
a blastp search in o. sativa, s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum, v. vinifera and the green alga v. carteri proteomes with arabidopsis abc protein dataset allowed us to discover a number of potential abc sequences. the domain composition of proteins was assessed through a domain detection analysis. a total of  <dig> proteins  containing one or more atp-binding cassette domains were identified. our analysis enlarged number of abc proteins identified in rice  <cit> , confirming data on abcg family refined by matsuda et al.  <cit> , added  <dig> novel abc transporters in v. vinifera,  <cit>  and provide manual curated abc protein catalogues for s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum. most of these proteins belong to known plant subfamilies  . proteins containing a single domain or novel associations were also recorded. the subfamily a is well conserved among plant species , but it is absent in s. cerevisiae. probably this protein group associated with perturbed cellular lipid transport  <cit> , originated after the division of ascomycota and chlorophyta. subfamily g showed the highest number of members in all the species tested. subfamilies b and c presented a number of proteins rather stable  in the analysed genomes except for v. carteri and s. cerevisiae. interestingly, abc proteins of d, e and f subfamilies represent about 6% of the abc transporters in o. sativa, s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum, v. vinifera and a. thaliana but about 25% in v. carteri and s. cerevisiae. the abcg proteins were found to represent an average of about 40%  of all annotated transporters in each analysed species. subfamily g was particularly represented in rice and potato, in which  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were annotated, respectively.

normalizing the total number of abc proteins identified in each species on proteome size, we found a considerable number of abc proteins in v. vinifera and s. tuberosum and a much lower number in o. sativa. the fraction of single abc subfamily members in each plant species proteome varies considerably . the a. thaliana profile shows an expansion of proteins belonging to subfamily b. s. tuberosum and v. vitifera has a similar abc profile with the exception of a slight expansion of subfamily f, whose members have been found involved in growth and development  <cit> . also s. lycopersicum shows an analogous profile, but in this case, a clear contraction of the proteins belonging to subfamily g has been observed. a triplication event, retained in potato and lost in tomato, contributes to modify the profile of several gene families  <cit> . indeed, it has been already demonstrated that tomato and potato genomes differ significantly for r gene complement  <cit> . subfamily f is highly represented in s. cerevisiae and in v. carteri, suggesting an important role in basic processes.figure  <dig>

selection pressure acting on plant abc families
the dissimilarity level between the non-synonymous substitution  and synonymous substitution  values has been used to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on protein coding genes. in order to discover the selection pressure that characterize the abc subfamilies in a. thaliana, o. sativa, s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum and v. vinifera, we used two different approaches based on nei-gojobori and slac methods  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the results of neutrality tests performed for each abc subfamilies by using coding dna sequence  alignments. the average δ  and ω  value of subfamilies a, b, c, d, and e ranges from − <dig>  to − <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively, indicating that a negative selection is acting against extreme polymorphic variants. the stabilizing selection that characterizes these subfamilies can be ascribed to the plants need to preserve important protein functions  <cit> . in particular, subfamily e, whose members encode solute-carrier organic anion transporters  <cit> , appeared to be subject to a very strong negative selection pressure , probably because of its role in rna degradation  <cit> . for the abcf subfamily, the slac analysis underlines a soft purification selection . the subgroup gwbc is the only group that showed a positive average for ω value. indeed, single codon analysis of the abcgwbc group underlined  <dig> positively selected sites . finally, the abcgpdr showed a negative pressure , but the single codon analysis underlined  <dig> codons under positive selection, of which about 15% are located on the first two pfam nbd abc_transporter-like domains . probably, the global protein structure of abcgpdr has been conserved, but positive selection in specific sites of nbd domains has been promoted to generate novel functions  <cit> .table  <dig>

phylogenetic reconstruction of abc transporters evolutionary dynamics
in order to address questions about evolutionary history of abc proteins in plants, predicted proteins belonging to subfamily a-g were aligned between them. furthermore, we performed a maximum likelihood analysis for each abc subfamily using only complete abc protein sequences belonging to all the analysed species . the number of proteins analysed for each subfamily varied greatly. the sequences are grouped into robust clades supported by bootstrap values ≥ 70%, while to extract more information from evolutionary histories of each abc subfamily we highlighted selected subgroups indicated as “clusters”.figure  <dig>

the abca subfamily
abca phylogenetic tree  shows the presence of three ancestral v. carteri sequences, separated from the rest of proteins, and two clades with four clusters with a good bootstrap value  . clade  <dig> comprises members belonging to all the species analysed. it seems that the proteins belonging to cluster  <dig> are well conserved in all species, even if a swift diversification between arabidopsis and solanum spp. was found. clade1-cluster  <dig> shows that a gene expansion occurred only in eudicot genomes. the transmembrane region of four proteins belonging to this cluster , reveals a string of about  <dig> amino acids with an alignment identity >70%. members belonging to this subfamily are involved in cellular lipid transport  <cit> , and a role of full-length abca transporter at2g <dig> , named ataoh by sanchez-fernandez  <cit> , in sterol metabolism has been demonstrated. a similar function for other proteins included in this sub-cluster could be hypothesized. clade  <dig> includes  <dig> abc transporters annotated in v. carteri and  <dig> in vascular plant proteins, which are subjected to a high degree of differentiation in all angiosperm species with the exception of v. vinifera. it is interesting to note that clade 2-cluster  <dig> contains only  <dig> arabidopsis proteins with an alignment identity of about 70%, of which six are on chromosome  <dig>  while clade2-cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> solanum abca proteins with an alignment identity of 90%. a potential translocation of abc transporters between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of potato  may have occurred since the two chromosome segments show similar gene arrangements .

the abcb subfamily
the abcb evolutionary history  was inferred by analysing  <dig> proteins. several sub-groups were identified in this subfamily, suggesting a large diversification among the analysed species. the phylogenetic tree displayed  <dig> main clades, supported from high internal branch bootstrap indexes. subsequently, modifications of original sequence arrangement produced few sequences in yeast and algae, and a huge number in vascular plants. phylogenetic analysis suggests that sub-groups evolved differently in each species. however, orthologous of six arabidopsis proteins present in clade  <dig> were identified both in monocot and dicot species. proteins belonging to this subfamily seem to be involved in auxin influx transport in roots, and contribute to the basipetal transport in hypocotyls and root tips by establishing an auxin uptake sink in the root cap. moreover, they confer sensitivity to 1-n-naphthylphthalamic acid , regulate root elongation, initiation of lateral roots and development of root hairs, transport iaa, indole-3-propionic acid, npa syringic acid, vanillic acid and some auxin metabolites, but not  <dig> -d and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid  <cit> . in particular, at2g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  are involved in auxin transport in stems and root, respectively  <cit> . it is possible to predict similar functions for orthologous proteins and gain insight in species not yet characterized by looking at specific clade arrangements. for instance, clade  <dig> embraces ten transporters afferent to all the species analysed. s. cerevisiae  and arabidopsis  were found to be involved in iron homeostasis  <cit>  suggesting that this function is well conserved among species. proteins belonging to clade  <dig> present a well conserved string of  <dig> amino acids  following the pfam domains  . interestingly, a member of this group, at5g <dig>  has been reported as involved in aluminium resistance  <cit> . finally, in clade  <dig> , which groups  <dig> abc proteins, three large expansions were observed in tomato , potato  and rice . a perfect conservation of orthologous pairs between tomato and potato on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  has been detected.

the abcc subfamily
abcc  is a large subfamily of “full-size”, “forward-orientation” proteins. the phylogenetic tree obtained by comparing  <dig> proteins displays that three s. cerevisiae and six v. carteri proteins, and one protein from o. sativa  cluster separately. two distinctive angiosperm clades can be evidenced . proteins belonging to this subfamily have been found to be involved in cellular processes such as vacuolar transport, detoxification and regulation of guard cell plasma membrane ion channels. clade  <dig> encodes  <dig> proteins, of which four annotated in arabidopsis  are involved in detoxification, vacuolar transport of abscisic acid and glucosyl ester, organic anion transport, chlorophyll degradation and modulation of seed phytate content  <cit> . a unique orthologous in potato and rice, two members in tomato and four members in grape that are putatively involved in fruit maturation process have been found  <cit> . in clade  <dig> we underlined four remarkable clusters. in particular, cluster  <dig> groups orthologous genes of at2g <dig>  involved in vacuole traffic  <cit>  and cluster  <dig> contains nine proteins with an identity of 60% to at3g <dig> , involved in vacuolar transport of abscisic acid glucosylester  <cit> . in cluster  <dig> there is an arabidopsis abcc protein , involved in the regulation of anion and calcium channel activities  <cit> , which presents a high sequence similarity  with other four eudicot proteins. cluster  <dig> also contains angiosperm proteins with an average identity of about 75%.

the abcd subfamily
the abcd phylogeny tree obtained with proteins belonging to all considered phyla , revealed the evolutionary history of this subfamily. s. cerevisiae ykl188w peptide is separated from the two main clades and could be designated as the ancestral protein. abc transporters belonging to this subfamily have been found to play a role in the peroxisome transport  <cit> . clade  <dig> includes full-size” proteins  with “forward orientation”. in this clade is present the arabidopsis protein at4g <dig>  involved in a wide range of substrates for peroxisome uptake  <cit> . a similar function could be hypothesized for the homologous peptides  detected in tomato, potato and rice. clade  <dig> includes “half-size” proteins. the transmembrane domain  is very well conserved  among proteins belonging to this clade as well as the nbd  <dig> domain. interestingly, the two solanum  proteins and the three at1g <dig> , gsvivt <dig> and os01g <dig>  transporters show a higher identity with nbd motif of green alga vocar20007372m  and vocar20009192m , respectively .

the abce subfamily
abce subfamily , with only ten proteins detected, was found to be the smallest among the subfamilies analysed in this work. the structure of the phylogenetic tree was extremely useful in tracking the evolution of these “trasporters”, also known as rnase l inhibitors   <cit>  . the two ancestral s. cerevisiae  and v. carteri,  proteins were more similar to a. thaliana  and o. sativa,  proteins. only for solanum spp proteins, a small expansion was observed . in this group there was a v. vinifera protein  that clustered with the arabidopsis protein at4g <dig>  which contains n-terminal “ferrodoxin”  motifs and interacts with nucleic acids  <cit> .

the abcf subfamily
the phylogenetic tree of abcf subfamily, obtained by comparing  <dig> proteins, reveals five clades . proteins belonging to this subfamily have been found to be involved in stress-associated control  <cit>  and seem to have an ancestral origin since they are highly represented both in v. carteri and s. cerevisiae . s. cerevisiae proteins are included in all clusters except for clades  <dig> and  <dig>  these two clades show an alignment identity of 61%and 66% respectively and include two v. carteri  proteins. interestingly, arabidopsis proteins present in clades  <dig> and  <dig>  have been found to be involved in root growth and development  <cit>  and a similar role could be predicted for proteins belonging to such clade. clade  <dig>  with an alignment identity greater than 75%, includes highly conserved proteins in all species analysed. clade  <dig> comprises six proteins belonging to s. cerevisiae and v. carteri, with a low alignment identity . interestingly, three of these proteins , one in yeast and two in algae, have an additional chromo-domain .

the abcg subfamily
abcg, the largest plant abc transporter subfamily, includes two groups according to sanchez-fernandez nomenclature: wbcs and pdrs. members of the abcgwbc consist of approximately 600– <dig> amino acid residues  <cit>  and can be involved in the cuticular lipids extrusion  <cit> . abcg full-size proteins  have a nbd domain characterized by four “plant pdr signatures”  <cit> . many proteins belonging to this subfamily have been found to be involved in resistance to pathogens, antimicrobial terpenoids and auxinic herbicides, and contribute to the transport of signalling molecules or secretion of volatile compounds  <cit> .

the abcgwbc group
the abcgwbc evolutionary analysis, obtained by comparing  <dig> proteins, shows a high diversification . eleven clades that encompass a number of proteins varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  have been produced. clades  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encompass 33% of the sequences analysed. a putative progenitor of clades  <dig> and  <dig> could be the s. cerevisiae protein ycr011c. in the clade  <dig> is present at3g <dig> , which appears to be involved in kanamycin resistance when overexpressed in transgenic plants  <cit> . in clade  <dig> we found sequences that are highly conserved in eudicot genomes. clade  <dig> and  <dig> encode transporters that could be involved in lipid/sterol homeostasis regulation required for proper vascular development, likewise the at1g <dig>  and at4g <dig>  proteins  <cit> . clade  <dig> groups three sequences similar to at3g <dig>  , which has been found involved in abscisic acid transport  <cit> . clade  <dig> includes a s. cerevisiae sequence  that can be ancestral to the diversification that occurs from clade  <dig> to  <dig>  clade  <dig> includes only  <dig> rice transporters. clade  <dig> includes  <dig> transporters similar to at1g <dig>  and at1g <dig> , which are required for export of wax components such as alkanes  <cit> .

the abcgpdr group
abc pdr transporters show a highly conserved pdr domain defined by pfam database . the phylogenetic analysis, performed by comparing  <dig> proteins , separated the abcgpdr proteins in two well definite groups . clade  <dig>  includes exclusively 8 s. cerevisiae proteins characterized by the pdr domain . in yeast, pdr proteins confer resistance to several anti-fungal compounds by actively transporting their substrates out of cell. next, two v. carteri proteins  separate clade  <dig> from clade  <dig>  the sequences of clade  <dig> are collapsed in eleven clusters marketed with different colours in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree of pdr group of atp-binding cassette subfamily g . evolutionary analyses were performed as reported for abca transporter subfamily.



within the cluster  <dig>   <dig> solanum proteins are grouped, with a pairwise identity of 82%, located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tomato and potato genomes. abcgpdr sequences of this cluster show a high similarity with an atp-binding cassette transporter  of a. thaliana pdr <dig> /abcg <dig> known to be involved in pleiotropic drug resistance and abscisic acid  uptake transport  <cit> . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are specific for v. vinifera while clusters  <dig> and  <dig> include only o. sativa sequences, suggesting a recent expansion of abcgpdr in grape and rice. in cluster  <dig> is present the a. thalianaat2g <dig>  gene, that is involved in cutin formation  <cit> . the five dicot and monocot orthologous belong to this cluster, could be predicted to be putatively involved in cutin formation as well.

cluster  <dig> includes eight v. vinifera proteins encoded from genes located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and eleven solanum proteins encoded from genes located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which show a high identity with the a. thaliana at1g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  genes, known to be highly expressed in the root cells for the secretion of several secondary metabolites  <cit> . cluster  <dig> encompasses an arabidopsis pdr protein , which seems to be involved into susceptibility/resistance to the barley powdery mildew pathogen  <cit> . eight proteins annotated in tomato, potato, grape and rice with a pairwise identity of 67% also belong to this cluster. thirteen and six transporters were grouped in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in cluster  <dig>  the six a. thaliana proteins, including at4g <dig> , a protein involved in root exudation of phytochemicals  <cit>  show an average identity > 60% with the other proteins of this cluster. in cluster  <dig>  a very strong homology  among five solanum and v. vinifera proteins with a. thaliana at2g <dig>  protein involved in the modulation of stomata activity  <cit>  was detected.

genomic distribution and recent gene duplication events
the genome-wide distribution of arabidopsis, tomato, potato, rice and grape abc transporter genes based on the chromosome size was significantly non-random  . the greatest numbers of abcs in arabidopsis were found on chromosomes  <dig> . in solanaceae genome about 15% of transporters were located on chromosome  <dig>  while the smallest number has been found on chromosome  <dig>  in rice and grape genomes, about  <dig> and 26% of abc transporters were positioned on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.figure  <dig> 
distribution of abc transporter genes across chromosomes for each plant species analysed.




available genomic data provide substantial evidences for abundance of duplicated genes in all surveyed organisms. the gene duplications occupy a leading role in the evolution of genomes. the importance of these events is linked to the necessity of organisms to generate novel functions  <cit> . detailed computational analysis of individual gene families in different genomic sequences can be used to uncover the mechanisms behind the evolution by gene duplication. in order to discover abc gene duplications that took place in each analysed genome, we developed a robust system  for detecting recent duplication events . a total of  <dig> abc genes were involved in recent duplications, with 25%  of annotated transporters in the seven species .table  <dig>

anumber of duplicate abc transporter genes for each considered subfamily.



more than 90% of gene duplications found in this study concern b, c and g sub-families. instead, transporters belonging to subfamilies d and e showed to be highly conserved . in particular  <dig> genes, out of  <dig> annotated in subfamily g, are involved in duplication events , indicating a considerable implication of this abc subfamily expansion in all the vascular plants analysed here.

the following example illustrated a case study of a solanum spp. abc transporter locus  under high evolutionary pressure. this region contains five potato and three tomato transporter genes in respective genome, showing a high homology to at1g <dig> ,  which is known to be involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, abscisic acid  uptake transport and lead resistance during pseudomonas infection  <cit> . the tomato locus on chromosomes  <dig> showed an average identity 75% with the orthologous potato locus. the genes found in this solanum locus are grouped in the abcgpdr phylogenetic tree cluster  <dig>  figure 8a proposed the phylogenetic reconstruction of recent duplication events and orthologous relationships between tomato and potato abcgpdr transporters. moreover, a genomic alignment is showed in panel b where the collinear genome blocks confirmed the high conservation of this genomic region in solanum species.figure  <dig>

tomato expression profile of abc transporter families
a tomato genome-wide overview of abc expression profiles was performed to gain insights into the biological role of abc proteins in tomato. it is already demonstrated that abc genes can exert their control via transcription expression and that synteny approach is a powerful tool to identify candidates in this species  <cit> . we analysed the expression profiles of our abc tomato annotated genes in five different tissues , by grouping abc genes according to their subfamily. of  <dig> abc transporters annotated in s. lycopersicum heinz  <dig>  more than 85% are expressed in at least one of the tissues examined, considering a value normalized as transcripts per million  >  <dig> . all members of a, d, e and f subfamilies and about 85% of transporters of subfamilies c and i are expressed, while 72% and 67% of abcb and abcg genes show a tpm value higher than  <dig> respectively, suggesting that 15-30% of members belonging to these subfamilies could be pseudogenes. some of these subfamilies  show also a high rate of gene duplication, suggesting that during the diversification, pseudogenization events could be occurred  <cit> .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
abc proteins are firmly established as key players of cellular processes involved in auxin transport, lipid catabolism, xenobiotic detoxification, disease resistance and stomatal function. in this study,  <dig> abc transporters were identified by in silico analysis of four plant species  and  <dig> transporters in the green alga v. carteri, by comparing them with those reannotated in arabidopsis  and the yeast s. cerevisiae. the characterization of abc proteins based on domain annotation allowed the discovering of new subfamily members. moreover, we ascertained that abcg represents the largest group of abc proteins in all plant species analysed. phylogenetic analysis allowed us to trace the evolutionary history of plant abcs, evidencing eukarya diversification. it is well known that a large genome datasets accelerate gene discovery in plants. by analysing the expression data of all tomato abcs identified in this study, we were able to provide an indication of the putative role of these genes. the results from this work offer useful inputs that may help, for instance, to discover abc genes with broader or more specific roles, and help to address several biological questions concerning the evolution of the relationships between genomes of different species.
