BACKGROUND
interaction between various environmental signals and flowering genes is critical for plants to flower and complete their life cycle, and thus important to humans, who rely upon adequate production of fruit and seeds to feed the world’s growing population. climate change fluctuations accompanying global warming  <cit>  are requiring plant breeders to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying flowering, and to develop strategies for manipulating and optimizing the flowering times to maximize crop yields. four flowering pathways—autonomous, vernalization, photoperiod and gibberellic acid—have been established in arabidopsis and partially identified in other species  <cit> . vernalization is an adaptive trait in which plants acquire the ability to flower following exposure to cold temperatures. a series of genes in the endogenous network involved in this process, and their regulatory relationships, have been identified; genes from different flowering pathways function together with other integrator genes to control flowering  <cit> . the mads-box family gene flowering locus c  represses flowering  <cit>  by suppressing the expression of flowering locus t , a key flowering integrator and confirmed florigen in plants  <cit> , and other floral integrator genes such as flowering duration and suppressor of overexpression of constans <cit> . expression of flc is reduced by vernalization  <cit> . flc is up-regulated by frigida  and repressed by genes in the autonomous pathway  <cit> . flc expression has also been shown to be regulated via histone acetylation and methylation, which alters the expression of a trans-acting regulator common to flc and members of the related mads affecting flowering gene  <cit> .

the genus brassica, which diverged from arabidopsis  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago  <cit>  includes more crops of agricultural and horticultural importance than any other genus in the family of brassicaceae. comparative analysis has revealed that diploid brassica genomes are composed of conserved segments triplicated from arabidopsis <cit> . the allopolyploid species b. napus  is a product of natural hybridization between diploid species b. rapa  and b. oleracea . rapeseed originated in southern europe along the coastline of the mediterranean sea  <dig> – <dig>  years ago, and was domesticated as an oil crop 400– <dig> years ago. this crop was originally grown as a spring or semi-winter crop in mediterranean climates; its cultivation spread rapidly from southern into northern europe after the development of winter rapeseed varieties, which do not flower during the long and cold winters. understanding the evolution of flowering time is critical for domestication and introduction of rapeseed into new agroclimatic regions.

miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  belong to a class of non-autonomous dna transposable elements known as class ii transposons. they are present in high copy number in the genome and contribute to genomic structure variations and intra-species diversity  <cit> . differing mite insertion profiles among varieties of a given species enable tolerance to environmental changes and allow adaptation under selective pressure  <cit> .

genetic analyses of several mapping populations of brassica have revealed that both major and minor quantitative trait loci  control flowering time. some of these qtls have also been shown to collocated with candidate genes for flowering time such as co, flc, ft and fri <cit> . forty-two qtls were identified in a doubled haploid  rapeseed mapping population  derived from a cross between tapidor and ningyou <dig>  but their magnitude and genetic effects varied with growing environment  <cit> . one major flowering time qtl, qft10- <dig>  which accounted for more than 50% of phenotypic variation in flowering time in the tn dh populations grown in non-vernalization environments, was colocalized with the ortholog of flc from arabidopsis in chromosome a <dig> and was designated bnflc.a <dig> <cit> . in our study, the candidate gene bnflc.a <dig> for qft10- <dig> was dissected using a map-based cloning approach, and an association was found between a tourist-like mite insertion/deletion in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> and the stronger vernalization requirement in rapeseed.

RESULTS
cloning of bnflc.a <dig> from qft10- <dig> and allelic divergence
to construct a high-resolution map of the qft10- <dig> locus, we analyzed a large bc5f <dig> population  that was derived from a cross between the dh line tn dh <dig>  and ningyou <dig> . four molecular markers developed from the sequence of the bacterial artificial chromosome  clone jbnb75d <dig>  which contains bnflc.a <dig>  were used for the analysis . eight recombinants were identified and the qtl qft10- <dig> was delimited to an 80-kb region that showed collinearity with the top of chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis thaliana . none of the genes in this region except flc are known to be involved in floral transition.

to analyze the basis of the vernalization requirement in rapeseed, we cloned and compared bnflc.a <dig> sequences  from tapidor and ningyou <dig>  the parental lines of the mapping population. no polymorphism was found in the coding sequence  between the two alleles . however, there were two insertion/deletions  in the upstream region, together with two indels  and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms  in intron  <dig> of bnflc.a <dig> . expression analysis showed that bnflc.a10-n was markedly down-regulated upon exposure to cold treatment after  <dig> week, whereas expression of bnflc.a10-t decreased gradually over  <dig> weeks of cold treatment . this observation provides strong evidence that bnflc.a <dig> underlies variation for vernalization requirement and that differences in gene expression establish the basis for allelic variation at the qft10- <dig> locus.

a 621-bp insertion upstream of bnflc.a10-t is associated with winter habit in rapeseed
to determine whether sequence variations in the two bnflc.a <dig> alleles contribute to differences in vernalization requirements or winter growth habit among natural rapeseed populations, we conducted an association analysis using a panel of  <dig> diverse rapeseed cultivars representing winter, semi-winter and spring genotypes. all of the cultivars were planted in spring environments. because of lack of vernalization, none of the winter-type cultivars flowered; in contrast all of the spring-type and semi-winter-type cultivars  flowered normally . the three largest indels  were analyzed first because the alleles could be easily distinguished by pcr . for indel i, the 621-bp insertion was absent in all spring and semi-winter cultivars, but was present in all  <dig> winter cultivars except coma. the 621-bp insertion showed a highly significant correlation with flowering phenotype . in contrast, indel ii  and indel iv  were only weakly associated with flowering phenotype .

haplotyping of bnflc.a <dig> specific markers for indels i–iv and snps 1– <dig>  confirmed that most winter rapeseeds had a 621-bp insertion in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> , whereas the 621-bp fragment was absent in the spring types . these results suggest that indel i  in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> plays a very important role in modulating flowering time in natural rapeseed germplasm and potential development of a winter growth habit.

the 621-bp insertion in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> is a tourist-like mite
to further characterize the 621-bp insertion sequence in winter-type rapeseed accessions, bnflc.a <dig> alleles from the eight cultivars that representing haplotype i  were sequenced and aligned. all the sequenced genotypes showed 100% identity. the inserted sequence possessed typical characteristics of a tourist-like mite  <cit> , with 14-bp terminal inverted repeat  sequences flanked by target sequence duplications  of taa . between the tir sequences, an at-rich  core that contained  <dig> classes of important motifs  was identified . these motifs might function in transcriptional initiation or promotion, or in response to different stimuli and signals . at least four homologs of the mite insertion  were identified in the genomic sequence of b. napus from public databases  and up to  <dig> copies  were identified in the sequenced genome of b. rapa, the ancestral source of the a genome in b. napus. these homologs defined a new family of mites, which we named monkey king  after the subject of a chinese myth. . 

origin and transmission of the bnflc.a <dig> 621-bp insertion in b. napus and its a genome ancestral species b. rapa
to understand the evolutionary process behind the adaptation associated with the insertion of monkey king into the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> and to trace its origin and transmission, we investigated an additional  <dig> spring cultivars of b. napus and  <dig> cultivars  belonging to nine subspecies of b. rapa . no monkey king insertion was detected in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> in any of the accessions, even though the empty site of insertion was almost 100% identical to the sequences that flanking the monkey king insertion in bnflc.a <dig> in winter rapeseed . on the other hand, hundreds of copies of monkey king were detected in the whole genome, but not in the brflc.a <dig> upstream region of b. rapa ‘chiifu’. this suggests that monkey king may have pre-existed in the b. rapa genome but was inactive, after the generation of b. napus, it was activated and inserted into the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig>  giving rise to winter rapeseed.

discussion
in this study, we used positional cloning to dissect the major flowering time qtl, qft10- <dig>  which was detected only in the spring-cropped tn dh population. the qtl qft10- <dig> on chromosome a <dig> was delimited in a narrow 80-kb genomic region and annotation of different genes allowed us to identify bnflc.a <dig>  an ortholog of flc, as the candidate gene. we demonstrated for the first time that flowering time variation at the qft.10- <dig> locus is conditioned by the major vernalization response gene, bnflc.a10; the mite insertion upstream of bnflc.a <dig> show significant association with the flowering time variation between winter and spring rapeseed.

control of flowering time by vernalization has previously been shown to depend on a complex regulatory network, especially in amphidiploid rapeseed. in one study of the relationship between flowering time and flc orthologs, five bnflc sequences were isolated from b. napus cdna library and in another study six flc paralogs have been identified in b. napus by comparative analysis of b. napus and arabidopsis genomes  <cit> . the fact that indel i in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> cosegregated with flowering phenotype in the tn dh population but in only some of the diverse cultivars might be due to the contribution of other flowering time qtls, including other bnflcs, with very small genetic effects. for examples, one of the bnflc paralogs, which was located in linkage group a <dig> , colocalized with the flowering time qtl and thus might contribute to the vernalization response in certain cultivars  <cit> . in fact, at least nine copies of bn.flc genes exist in rapeseed  <cit> . other genes, such as frigida, also regulate flc expression in rapeseed; bnaa.fri.a, one of orthologs of frigida in arabidopsis, contributes to flowering time variation in rapeseed, which may partly explain why indel i did not totally cosegregated with flowering time in the association analysis  <cit> . in our research, the cultivar “coma” that lacked the bnflc.a <dig> upstream mite insertion still exhibited the winter characteristic. it is thus possible that other copies of bnflcs or related genes from the vernalization pathway may contribute to vernalization response in b. napus. the expression of one of the other bnflc copies, or of all bnflc copies acting in concert in the coma genome, may be sufficient to inhibit flowering transition under spring environmental conditions, therefore enabling the cultivar ‘coma’ to function as a winter rapeseed. genetic diversity with respect to bnflcs and other arabidopsis vernalization pathway gene homologs has been associated with vernalization in b. napus, but no gene or polymorphic site as strongly associated with vernalization requirement of rapeseed as the bnflc.a <dig> upstream mite insertion has been dissected previously. the mite insertion into bnflc.a <dig> appears to be one of the most important causative factors of vernalization requirement in winter rapeseed cultivars.

it is believed that rapeseed originated from a natural hybridization between b. rapa and b. oleracea that occurred in southern europe along the mediterranean coastline approximately  <dig> – <dig>  years ago. given the warm climate in this region year-round, naturally occurring rapeseed genotypes and their ancestors may not have needed to develop an adaptation requiring prolonged vernalization. the activation of monkey king in b. napus genome would have introduced diversity into the germplasm upon which selective pressure could act. the insertion of monkey king in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig> resulted in strong dependence on vernalization for flowering; this characteristic was then selected by plant breeders during the development of winter-type rapeseed cultivars of rapeseed that could be grown in northern europe and other temperate regions of the world.

several studies have examined the effect of mites on neighboring gene expression. for example, the dna methylation level of a mite can influence expression of neighboring genes. an assay of transient and stably-transformed rice revealed that the mite kiddo, when present in the promoter of the rice ubiquitin <dig>  gene, was responsible for up to 20% of neighboring gene expression; most notably, when dna methylation of kiddo was blocked, transcript levels of endogenous rubq <dig> increased threefold  <cit> . an association has also been reported between a mite inserted in the upstream regulator region of the gene vgt <dig>  and early flowering in northern maize genotypes  <cit> . in our study, the mite upstream of bnflc.a <dig> was positively associated with gene expression and induced bnflc.a <dig> expression during vernalization. the inserted mite seems to attenuate cold-induced bnflc.a <dig> repression rather than increase its expression, in winter rapeseed. this result is very similar to that observed in arabidopsis, where flc expression was correlated with flowering time and vernalization requirement in unvernalized or long days, but not as strongly as anticipated  <cit> . we thus conclude that either decreased rate of flc expression during vernalization or additional epistatic interaction with other genes is more important for control of flowering time and vernalization requirement than variation of flc expression under unvernalized conditions. using motif prediction, motifs associated with gene regulation were found to exist in the monkey king sequence . most of these motifs were located in gene promoter and enhancer regions  or were light responsive elements   associated with response to environmental signals in different organisms. certain transcriptional factors presumably bind to this region to more efficiently initiate or enhance the expression of neighbouring genes. the actual protein binding ability of the 621-bp insertion was evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . nuclear protein extracted from tapidor before vernalization were able to bind to some fragments from the middle of the 621-bp monkey king region that contained tata box motifs . these results suggest that monkey king can bind to specific transcription factors that may initiate or enhance bnflc.a <dig> expression in winter rapeseed cultivars, giving rise to their stronger vernalization requirement.

our analysis also indicated that monkey king is involved in gene regulation in many different settings in the genome. for example, we found three copies of the sequence gactggtt near the 5’ end of monkey king ; this motif is conserved in the upstream region of dsg <dig>  in mice. the motif in dsg <dig> is recognized by grhl <dig>  and increases dsg <dig> expression  <cit> . part of the monkey king sequence is transcribed in brassica genomes , and has been identified in the 3' untranslated region of the wrky21- <dig> gene . other transcripts that share high similarity with portions of the monkey king sequence have been found in the expressed sequence tag library of rapeseed . the presence of these transcripts suggests the existence of a novel gene regulatory mechanism that is similar to the method by which exon shuffling generates new genes  <cit>  or overlapping transcripts generate sirnas to regulate gene expression  <cit> . it is possible that transcripts derived from monkey king might regulate native gene expression through sirna-induced dna methylation. mite activities within bnflc.al <dig> may have shaped phenotypic diversity and influenced mechanisms of adaptation to diverse climates during the evolutionary process. 

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that bnflc.a <dig> is the highly likely causative gene underlying qft10- <dig>  which accounted for most flowering time variation in the tn dh population under spring environmental conditions. comparision of allelic sequences from tapidor and ningyou <dig> revealed the presence of a tourist-like mite insertion in winter-type cultivar tapidor. association analysis among winter- and spring-type rapeseeds revealed that the presence of the tourist-like mite insertion is very strongly associated with vernalization requirement, and suggested that it appeared after b. napus was generated as a product of natural hybridization between b. rapa and b. oleracea. mite activity led to genetic and phenotypic diversities among varieties and provided the fuel for evolutionary selection. as a result, winter genotypes may have evolved from spring genotypes; this useful variation has subsequently been used as a genetic resource for the development of winter cultivars enabling worldwide production of rapeseed.
