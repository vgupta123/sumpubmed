BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut  is the second-most important legume in the world, with a total global production of  <dig> million tons  <cit> . legumes are the second-most important food crop following grains, representing an important source of protein for humans and livestock in the north and south america, africa, and asia. additionally, when considering oil production for cooking and fuels, peanut represents one of the highest value-added crops, with an annual worth of $ <dig> billion to farmers and $ <dig> billion to the overall economy in the u.s. alone.

recent progress in functional genomics has enabled the study of plant responses at whole-transcriptome levels, revealing the complex nature of multi-genic responses in plants  <cit> . while genes and proteins expressed differentially under a variety of environmental perturbations and developmental stages have been identified in model plant systems such as arabidopsis  <cit> , studies on stress-induced or developmentally regulated genes in crop plants have been limited but are beginning to emerge  <cit> . while positional cloning and candidate gene approaches have begun to identify a number of structural genes or transcription factors controlling the larger response to abiotic and biotic stimuli  <cit> , this work has been limited in peanut due to a lack of genomic data. identification of such genes will have a significant effect on varietal development by traditional breeding and genetic engineering.

greater attention is needed for genomic development in the leguminosae. despite its importance as both a cash crop and important staple, little is known about the genetic mechanisms in peanut that control disease resistance or susceptibility, stress tolerance, or pod development  <cit> . although significant efforts have gone into legume genomics, there is a paucity of genomic data for peanut, bean, and chickpea compared to soybean, medicago truncatula, and lotus japonicus  <cit> . in peanut, marker technology is relatively young and only recently have genetic maps been published  <cit> . although an initial cdna microarray with  <dig> unigenes was published  <cit> , there are no reports of high-density oligonucleotide microarray platforms in peanut. as part of our ongoing effort to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying peanut development and response to abiotic stress, we have designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray using all publicly available peanut ests. there are several advantages to the oligonucleotide microarray approach, including uniformity of hybridization, probe performance and specificity, and the flexibility of customization or probe addition as more sequences enter the public domain  <cit> . to test the utility of this array for expression studies in both vegetative and reproductive tissues and identify putatively pod-specific genes, we compared transcript abundance in pod, leaf, stem, root, and peg tissues. we present here, the utility of the first large-scale publicly available peanut microarray and establish the foundation for investigation of molecular responses on a transcriptome scale.

RESULTS
peanut microarray design
an oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig>  unique probes was created from  <dig>  peanut ests available in genebank  as templates for probe design . a total of  <dig>  probes were designed using the server-based earray platform from agilent technologies  <cit> . the remaining ests represented duplicates, sequences interspersed with long repeats, or a significant number of undetermined bases which failed to meet criteria required for accurate probe design. the initial set of  <dig>  high quality probes with a cross hybridization potential of zero were used to query swisprot with blastx. the multiple matches from this query were saved and the best match that was better than e- <dig> was used to annotate each probe. those probes not meeting the criterion for annotation were annotated as having unknown function. probes annotated as "unknown" were binned into two categories: 1) probes not meeting the minimum criteria from the blastx query, and 2) probes matching a sequence  annotated as unknown in swissprot, i.e., "known unknowns". a final list of  <dig>  probes was selected to create the probe group ah <dig> for microarray design  in addition to  <dig> agilent controls and  <dig> random probes selected from the existing list of  <dig>  probes.

functional category enrichment based on gene ontology  was performed for all  <dig>  probes present in the array using the blast2go search tool  <cit> . query against swisprot resulted in the annotation of  <dig>  known genes and  <dig>  transcript probes with unknown function. figure 1a shows go functional groups for known transcripts represented on the ah <dig> array and a detailed description of the go molecular function  cluster is displayed in figure 1b which indicates uniform distribution of probes with binding and catalytic functions. this represents ~24% of genic content, given that the total number of genes in peanut is estimated to be  <dig>   <cit> . the peanut ests used in this design were from libraries representing diverse tissues, although root, stem, and cotyledon are under-represented . therefore, these microarray probes have a broad utility for tissue specific transcripts expressed under a variety of conditions. furthermore, the use of the agilent system allows for flexibility in future array versions as additional ests can be added from the public domain.

a full description of the array is available in the gene expression omnibus database as platform gpl <dig> 

microarray quality
the quality of the microarray was evaluated using the two comparisons:  two biological replicates of the same tissue-type labeled with the same dye and  the same tissue from two biological replicates labeled with either cy <dig> or cy <dig> dyes. the correlation coefficients of log transformed normalized ratios between the two replicates and two different dyes  were calculated by kaleidagraph  <dig>   . for pod and leaf comparisons, the correlation coefficient between the biological replicates labeled with cy3/cy <dig> was  <dig>  . reciprocal hybridizations  were utilized for all tissue comparisons to avoid dye bias. the correlation coefficient for the same pod and leaf tissues in a dye-swap experiment where the same tissue was labeled with cy <dig> in one biological replicate and cy <dig> in another biological replicate was  <dig>  . for labeling,  <dig> ng to  <dig> μg total rna is needed for agilent custom arrays unlike cdna arrays which require  <dig> μg to  <dig> μg. this is very important for profiling samples containing limited amounts of rna or small structures such as floral parts and developing pods. further the  <dig> ×  <dig> k array design has the feature of eight independent arrays in one slide, which is not only cost effective but also can reduce variation among the arrays within a slide.

tissue specific gene expression using the peanut oligonucleotide microarray
in recent studies, leaf, root, seed coat, and cotyledon tissues were utilized for global expression profiling in soybean  <cit>  and leaf and bud tissues were used to test a spotted cotton oligonucleotide microarray for tissue-specific gene expression analysis  <cit> . four pairs of tissue comparisons were performed for each tissue in the present study. these comparisons resulted in the list of statistically-significant, differentially expressed genes in each tissue shown in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  the entire data set can be accessed at the gene expression omnibus  database as platform gpl <dig> and series gse <dig>  additionally, go annotations based on biological process  are presented in figure  <dig> for those transcripts showing tissue-specific expression patterns. transcripts showing at least two-fold difference in abundance  at a p-value ≤  <dig>  were classified as differentially expressed and those with differential expression unique to a single tissue were considered as having putatively tissue-specific functions  <cit> . in summary, there were  <dig> transcripts representing  <dig> gene functions that were differentially expressed in at least one tissue comparison. of these transcripts,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed tissue-specific differential expression patterns in leaf, stem, root, and peg, respectively . two-hundred-eleven gene transcripts were differentially expressed in all four comparisons,  <dig> pod-abundant and  <dig> that were significantly more abundant in leaf, stem, root, and peg compared to pod.

gene expression profiles of different tissues provide information about the biological function of the genes expressed in those tissues  <cit> . for the pod abundant pool, only  <dig> transcripts could be assigned a putative function based on blast analysis. all tissues showed similar go bp enrichments associated with metabolic processes , cellular processes , and response to stimuli . while peanut pod undisputedly is the most important organ from an agronomic perspective and the genes specifically up-regulated in that tissue are of interest, other tissue-specific genes or expression patterns may reveal significant information related to productivity, disease resistance, development, and physiological response. figure  <dig> shows that the functional roles of putative tissue-specific genes are similar for leaf, stem, and peg compared to root. while this is not surprising given the similarities of genes highly expressed in green leaves or stems, it should be noted that the majority of peanut est sequences in the public domain are from leaf and pod. however, despite the absence of a large number of ests from root libraries, there are genes whose expression appears to be root specific.

genes and pathways identified in pods
due to paucity of information on peanuts in global repositories like ncbi, only half of the pod-abundant transcripts could be meaningfully annotated . two major categories of transcripts, namely storage proteins and desiccation-related proteins, were identified in pods. five transcripts related to seed storage proteins such as globulin, conglutin and glycinin were abundant in pod tissues. the desiccation-related transcripts over-represented included seed maturation protein, lea, early methionine labeled , legumin, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins  and desiccation related pcc13- <dig> proteins. in most higher plants the later seed maturation phase is characterized by a desiccation phase during which number of proteins distinct from the storage proteins are accumulated in embryos. according to their accumulation pattern it has been suggested that these particular proteins, called late embryogenesis abundant  could be involved in seed desiccation tolerance  <cit> . in addition to their expression during seed desiccation, many of the genes coding for leas can be highly induced in immature seeds or activated in vegetative tissues upon osmotic stress  <cit> , indicating that they are, in part, regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . on the other hand em proteins could be responsible for the maintenance of a minimal water content allowing preservation of cell content in dried seeds  <cit> .

utilizing the blast2go tool, twelve transcripts with an enzyme commission  number were mapped to twenty five different kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways. of these,  <dig> pathways relevant to pods were presented in additional file  <dig>  as expected, five major pathways leading to the production of sugars and starch involving the enzymes udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  and dtdp-glucose 4-6-dehydratase  were identified. peanut being an oilseed crop, the pathways leading to lipid metabolism  and sulfur containing amino acid metabolism  were predominant in pods. peroxidase enzyme  found abundant in pods have multiple roles in plants. apart from its reactive oxygen scavenging and water-stress signaling activity  <cit> , the peroxidase enzyme also catalyses phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism resulting in defense compounds which may protect the developing peanut pods in the soil. two enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  and hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase  were also found to be more abundant in pods. pyruvate thus generated may be involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites like terpenoids by the action of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose  <dig> phosphate synthase . together the pathway analyses suggests that in pod tissues apart form basic starch and lipid metabolism, secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and terpenoids are also synthesized and may impart defense for developing pod tissues in soil.

validation of array data with quantitative real-time pcr
quantitative real time pcr has become a gold standard for the gene expression and generally used for validation of microarray results  <cit> . to validate the microarray data from our study, quantitative real time pcr  analyses were performed on the same mrna samples used for the microarray experiments. eight differentially-expressed transcripts,  <dig> pod-enriched and  <dig> pod-deficient, were selected for qrt-pcr analysis . the relative expression pattern of all eight selected genes resembled respective microarray expression patterns  and suggested that microarray analyses utilizing the current array were highly reliable and accurate.

microarray and quantitative real time pcr expression values are mentioned as fold change of transcript in pods compared to different tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
peanut, being an under represented crop in terms of genome sequencing and physical mapping, needs a comprehensive tool for dissecting complex mechanisms of development and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. to attain this broad objective, we have designed and characterized a high density oligonucleotide microarray suitable for transcript profiling of various peanut tissues. analysis of pod abundant transcripts suggested the presence of distinct pathways involved in generation of secondary metabolites apart from the accumulation of transcripts for storage and desiccation-related protein. these peanut microarrays are publicly available and can be upgraded with additional oligonucleotides designed from subsequent sequencing efforts from the peanut research community. the expression profiles generated by these peanut microarrays will provide starting points for in-depth studies on candidate genes that can be utilized in reverse genetics to assign gene functions.
