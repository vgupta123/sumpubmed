BACKGROUND
presenilin  <dig>  constitutes the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex  <cit>  involved, together with β-secretase  <dig>   <cit> , in amyloid precursor protein  processing and amyloid β  production. abnormal aβ production is implicated in the pathogenesis of alzheimer’s disease  — a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory deterioration . although the exact sequence of events occurring in the brain and causing ad is not well understood, it appears that aβ accumulation occurs before the onset of cognitive decline  <cit>  and that synaptic loss most closely correlates with the memory impairments . moreover, traceable aβ deposition could already be detected in the default mode network brain regions in cognitively normal adults  <cit> , and experimentally induced synaptic activity was shown to increase aβ production , indicating a link between synaptic activity and aβ. interestingly, the level of aβ in the brain interstitial fluid is closely linked to synaptic vesicle  exocytosis  <cit> . these findings suggest that aβ can be produced locally at the synapse in an activity-dependent manner. however, molecular events and proteins involved in neuronal activity-modulated levels of synaptic aβ remain largely unknown.

synaptotagmin  <dig>  is a key molecule regulating synaptic vesicle  exocytosis in a calcium -dependent manner  <cit> . syt <dig> contains two ca2+-binding domains, c2a and c2b, and is one of the major calcium sensors at the synapse promoting sv exocytosis and neurotransmitter release in response to ca2+ influx . interestingly, increased intracellular calcium levels also enhance production of aβ and aβ <dig> in particular , implying that ca2+ influx may modulate the cleavage of app by β- and γ-secretases. still, little is known about the local synaptic effects of neuronal activity and ca2+ on app processing.

in the present study, we focused on, and searched for, potential neuronal activity-dependent modulators that can affect γ-secretase activity. we found that ps <dig> adopts a pathogenic “closed” conformation within minutes of ca2+ influx triggered by glutamate or kcl treatment, suggesting a ca2+-dependent mechanism. an unbiased proteomics screen of the mouse brain lysates in the presence or absence of ca2+ identified syt <dig> as a novel ca2+-dependent ps1- interacting protein, showing robust syt1-ps <dig> binding in the presence of high ca2+. furthermore, we found that syt <dig> may regulate aβ production via different mechanisms. we report that syt <dig> modulates the architecture and activity of the ps1/γ-secretase complex affecting the aβ species produced, is important for bace <dig> maturation and stability, and is involved in trafficking and compartmentalization of bace <dig> and ps <dig>  taken together, these data suggest that syt <dig> acts as a novel pre-synaptic calcium-dependent interactor of the ps1/γ-secretase that can regulate app processing and, thus, aβ production/secretion at the synapse in an activity-dependent manner.

RESULTS
ps <dig> conformation is dynamically regulated by ca2+ influx in intact neurons
neuronal activation is reported to modulate aβ production and elevate the aβ42/ <dig> ratio  <cit> . the latter correlates with distinct conformation of the ps1/γ-secretase . to probe for possible dynamic changes in ps1/γ-secretase in live cells in response to neuronal stimulation we used our previously developed ratiometric spectral förster resonance energy transfer  assay that utilizes gfp-ps1-rfp  as a reporter of ps <dig> conformation . as determined previously, the g-ps1-r protein can traffic through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, shows similar subcellular distribution to that of endogenous ps <dig>  can be incorporated into the γ-secretase complex, is efficiently endoproteolyzed, and reconstitutes the γ-secretase enzymatic activity in ps1/ <dig> double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts   <cit> . the change in the proximity between rfp and gfp fluorophore-tagged ps <dig> loop- and nt-domains  corresponds to the change in the ratio of rfp  to gfp  fluorescence intensity . the higher the r/g ratio the closer the two domains are, indicating so-called “closed” ps <dig> conformation.fig.  <dig> ps <dig> conformation and aβ production change upon kcl or glutamate treatment. a schematic representation of the “open”  and “closed”  ps <dig> conformation; green and red circles represent green fluorescent protein  and red fluorescence protein  fused to ps <dig> nt and l6- <dig>  respectively, to generate fret reporter probe. b time-lapse recording of ps <dig> conformational changes in live neurons transfected with gfp-ps1-rfp fret reporter probe and treated with kcl, glutamate, or water control. the spectral fret data are presented as a change in the rfp/gfp ratio,  <dig> to  <dig> neurons were analyzed for each condition; the graph shows mean ± sem; detailed statistical analysis of the spectral fret data evaluation is described in the methods. c time-lapse recording of oregon green  <dig> bapta-1 am fluorescence intensity changes reflecting intracellular calcium load in primary neurons treated with kcl, glutamate, or water control. three independent experiments, mean ± sem. d elisa measurements of secreted aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in conditioned-medium collected from kcl  or h2o  treated mouse cortical neurons. the aβ levels determined in pmol were normalized to the amount of total protein  extracted from the cells in the corresponding well. data are presented as mean% ± sem, n = 4; 100 % =  <dig>  pmol/g for aβ <dig> and  <dig>  pmol/g for aβ <dig>  statistical significance was determined using the mann-whitney u test, *p <  <dig> . ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  aβ amyloid β, nt n-terminus, fret förster resonance energy transfer



primary neurons  were transfected with the g-ps1-r and imaged every ~30 seconds prior to and after kcl bath treatment inducing membrane depolarization. we detected a rapid increase in the r/g ratio within the first minute of the stimulation, which lasted for at least 30 minutes . this suggests that ps <dig> has a dynamic structure that responds rapidly to kcl treatment by changing the nt-loop proximity. to confirm this finding, we used another stimulus, glutamate  that was applied transiently by puffing it directly onto the imaged neuron. again, a rapid increase in the r/g ratio was observed, indicating a change in the ps <dig> conformation. in this case, however, the r/g ratio returned to the baseline within 2 minutes, indicating that ps <dig> conformation was able to recover when the stimulant diffused . no change in the r/g ratio was observed in h2o-treated neurons or in neurons treated with glu in the ca2+/mg2+ free media. additional file  <dig> shows the gfp and rfp emission intensities and the r/g ratio in cells expressing gfp-ps <dig> , gfp-rfp fusion  or gfp-ps1-rfp, during 30 minutes recording. no gfp or rfp photobleaching was observed under the settings used. the increased r/g ratio after kcl application reflects increased fret efficiency and is observed in g-ps1-r expressing cells only.

to verify that both treatments increase intracellular calcium load , sister cultures were preloaded with oregon green  <dig> bapta-1 am and imaged using time-lapse settings. changes in the i strongly correlated with the r/g ratio .

these data reveal the dynamic nature of the ps1/γ-secretase and suggest that continuous insult  maintains ps1/γ-secretase in a “closed” conformation, while a transient stressor modulates ps <dig> reversibly.

furthermore, after 15 minutes of kcl treatment we could already detect increased levels of the secreted aβ <dig>  and aβ <dig> , resulting in an increased aβ42/ <dig> ratio  and consistent with the ps <dig> adopting a “closed” conformation at high intracellular ca2+.

synaptotagmin  <dig> is a novel calcium-dependent ps1-binding partner
to search for potential ca2+-dependent modulators of the ps1/γ-secretase at the synapse, we performed an unbiased mass spectrometry  proteomics screen of wild type  mouse brain lysed in 1 % triton x- <dig> in the presence or absence of ca2+. using gst-tagged peptides corresponding to ps <dig> domains or gst alone as a control, synaptotagmin  <dig>  was identified as a strong candidate for novel ps1-interacting presynaptic protein . syt <dig> interaction with ps <dig> was the strongest when gst-fused ps <dig> l6- <dig> peptide was used as “bait”, although a smaller number of syt <dig> peptides was also pulled down with the gst-ps <dig> nt peptide. since both l6- <dig> and ps <dig> nt sequences used for the pull down are localized within the post-endoproteolytic ps <dig> n-terminal fragment, the data suggest that syt <dig> interacts with the ps <dig> ntf. importantly, ca2+ level affected the interaction between ps <dig> and syt <dig>  with robust ps1-syt <dig> binding observed in the presence of high ca2+. identification of known ca2+-insensitive ps <dig> interactors, such as catenin delta <dig>  reaffirmed the specificity of the assay for ca2+-dependent ps <dig> binding partners.table  <dig> mass spectrometry screen identified syt <dig> as a novel synaptic ps1-binding protein that shows calcium-dependent profile of the interaction

ps <dig> co-localizes with syt <dig> at presynaptic terminals
to establish if ps <dig> co-localizes with syt <dig> in the presynaptic terminals, we triple-immunostained synaptoneurosomes  isolated from wt mouse cerebral cortex for: 1) ps <dig>  2) syt <dig>  and 3) either synapsin  <dig>  and vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig>  or microtubule-associated protein  <dig> , as pre- and postsynaptic markers, respectively.

bright field imaging and immunostaining demonstrate the presence of the snowman-shaped snss formed by pre- and post-synaptic terminals  and co-localization of endogenous ps <dig> with syt <dig>  syn <dig>  and vglut <dig> at the presynapse, in addition to ps <dig> presence at the postsynapse . of note, a fraction of the synaptic terminals was ps <dig> negative in both pre- and post-synaptic compartments. enrichment of the ps1/γ-secretase in the snss was further confirmed by western blotting and ps1-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy of mouse brain tissue . the latter showed that ps <dig> is present in synaptic vesicles of both the reserve and release-ready pools at the presynaptic membrane and within the postsynaptic terminals.fig.  <dig> ps1/γ-secretase present in the pre- and post-synaptic terminals. a confocal microscopy imaging shows co-localization of ps <dig> with syt <dig>  and with synapsin <dig> and vglut <dig>  in presynaptic compartments of isolated synaptoneurosomes . arrows show map2-positive post-synaptic buttons. insert on the left shows a bright field image of isolated sns. b western blot analysis of ps <dig> ctf, nct, pen- <dig>  syt <dig> and β actin as a control in total homogenate  and synaptoneurosome  fractions from wild type mouse brain. enrichment of the γ-secretase components in sns vs. total brain homogenate is quantified. data are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test; * p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> . c electron micrographs of synaptic terminals from mouse cortex immunostained for ps <dig> . red circles and arrows indicate positive staining in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, respectively. ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  vglut <dig> vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig>  map <dig> microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  ctf c-terminal fragment, nct nicastrin, pen- <dig> presenilin enhancer 2



ps <dig> interacts with syt <dig> on endogenous levels
the use of recombinant gst-ps <dig> peptide pull-down in the mass spectrometry screen has some limitations due to the possibility of improper folding. therefore, to verify occurrence of the interaction on endogenous level, we employed a different approach: co-immunoprecipitation  of ps1/γ-secretase with syt <dig> using 1 % chapso-solubilized extracts of mouse hippocampi, primary neurons, and cerebral cortex synaptoneurosomes . indeed, syt <dig> was co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> , suggesting a physiological function of the interactions between ps <dig> and syt <dig> in the brain. of note, other members of the γ-secretase complex were also pulled down with syt <dig> from the 1 % chapso-solubilized extracts, in which interactions among components of the γ-secretase complex are retained .fig.  <dig> ps <dig> interacts with syt <dig> on endogenous level. a syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with ps <dig> from mouse hippocampi. the co-ip assay was conducted using anti-ps <dig> ct and anti-ps <dig> nt antibodies for pull-down; the detection antibodies are indicated to the left of each blot, n =  <dig>  b ps <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with syt <dig> from mouse cortical primary neurons. the co-ip assay was conducted using anti-syt <dig> antibody for pull-down; the detection antibodies are indicated to the left of the blot. other γ-secretase components pulled-down with syt <dig> in the 1 % chapso buffer are shown, n =  <dig>  c syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with ps <dig> from synaptoneurosome  fractions in a ca2+-dependent manner. sns were solubilized in 1 % chapso buffer in the presence or absence of 2 mm cacl <dig>  n-terminal ps <dig> antibody  were used for pull-co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> ntf . all the data are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, * p <  <dig> . d syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with ps <dig> from mouse snss solubilized in 1 % tritonx- <dig> buffer in the presence of 2 mm cacl <dig> when anti-ps <dig> nt, but not anti-ps <dig> loop or anti-ps <dig> ct antibody, is used for pull-down. the detection antibodies are indicated on the left side of the blot. schematic representation of the ps <dig> molecule; the presumed syt <dig> interaction sites are shown. ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  ip immunoprecipitation, ct c-terminus, nt n-terminus, ntf n-terminal fragment



to validate the ca2+-dependence of the interactions, sns fractions were subjected to ip in the presence of 2 mm cacl <dig>  or 2 mm egta . indeed, more syt <dig> was co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> in the high ca2+ condition . there was no significant effect of ca2+ on the immunoreactivity of total lysates  or the efficiency of ps <dig> ntf and ctf interaction.

to examine which fragment of ps <dig>  predominantly binds syt <dig>  sns fractions were lysed in 1 % tx- <dig> buffer, disrupting interactions between the γ-secretase components  <cit> . the syt <dig> band was detected only when anti-ps <dig> nt antibody was used for the pull-down, suggesting that ca2+-bound syt <dig> selectively interacts with the ps <dig> n-terminal fragment . since the largest amount of the syt <dig> peptides during the ms screen was pulled down with the ps <dig> peptide corresponding to the amino acids  263– <dig> of the l6– <dig> domain, the region was further narrowed to the aa 263– <dig>  the c-terminal part of the ps <dig> ntf. of note, a smaller number of the syt <dig> peptides was also detected in the gst-ps <dig> nt  pull-down; hence, it is possible that this region provides an additional, lower-affinity interface for the interaction .

next, we tested whether ca2+ influx into mouse primary neurons due to kcl-induced membrane depolarization or calcium ionophore treatment would enhance endogenous interaction between ps <dig> and syt <dig>  for this, 21– <dig> days in vitro cultured neurons were treated with kcl or ca2+ ionophore  and subjected to co-ip/western blotting. an increased level of syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> in the kcl-stimulated neurons , compared to those treated with vehicle . an even higher increase was detected when a stronger stimulant, ca2+ ionophore, was used . collectively, these data provide strong evidence for endogenous, activity- and ca2+ influx-regulated ps1-syt <dig> interactions in neurons.fig.  <dig> ps <dig> interacts with syt <dig> in ca2+-dependent manner in primary neurons. a co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that kcl  or calcium ionophore a <dig> treatment  of primary neurons that trigger ca2+ influx strengthen the interaction between ps <dig> and syt <dig>  the asterisk shows a non-specific, heavy chain igg band. the graph presents quantitative analysis of the syt <dig> band intensity, mean ± sem. statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> . b flim analysis of the ps1-syt <dig> proximity in mouse cortical primary neurons treated for 5 minutes with 50 mm kcl  or water control . fluorescence images show ps <dig>  and syt <dig>  immunoreactivity. scale bar: 5 μm. pseudo-colored flim images depict lifetime of the alexa  <dig> donor fluorophore. colorimetric scale shows fluorescence lifetime in picoseconds. zoomed boxed area shows flim image superimposed onto a table indicating average lifetimes for each pixel  of the image. shortest lifetimes  reflect closest proximity between ps <dig> and syt <dig>  bar graph presents  fret efficiency  recorded in the outlined regions of interest  corresponding to the neuronal cell bodies or the processes. , n =  <dig> for cell bodies kcl, n =  <dig> for processes kcl and n =  <dig> for processes kcl; unpaired student t-test, *** p <  <dig> ). ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  flim fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, fret förster resonance energy transfer



syt1-ps <dig> interaction in intact neurons is stimulated by kcl treatment
to further validate and characterize endogenous ps1-syt <dig> interactions in intact neurons, we employed an antibody-based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  analysis. the fret efficiency , reflecting relative proximity between the fluorophore-labeled ps <dig> l6- <dig> epitope and syt <dig>  was increased in neurons stimulated with kcl, compared to vehicle-treated, suggesting more ps1-syt <dig> interactions in the former .

to determine subcellular localization of the ps <dig> and syt <dig> interactions, donor lifetime was color-coded and mapped on a pixel-by-pixel basis through the entire image. shortest lifetimes  were recorded mainly along the processes and co-localized with the dotted pattern of syt <dig> immunoreactivity, presenting synaptic boutons as sites of the kcl-induced ps1-syt <dig> interaction . of note, kcl treatment resulted in a significant increase in the %efret along the processes, without having a considerable effect on ps1-syt <dig> interactions in the cell bodies. these findings reaffirm that ps <dig> and syt <dig> interaction occurs on endogenous level, and that ca2+-influx induces the interaction primarily at the syt1-positive loci along the dendrites in primary neurons.

syt <dig> 3d-a mutations impair ca2+-dependent interactions between ps <dig> and syt1
to gain further insight into the ca2+-dependency of the syt <dig> interaction with ps <dig>  we constructed a 3d-a syt <dig> mutant by substituting for alanine three aspartate residues important for ca2+ binding  <cit> . pc <dig> cells lacking syt <dig>  were transfected with wild type or 3d-a syt1-v <dig> plasmids, treated with kcl or vehicle, harvested, and subjected to co-ip/western blotting. as expected, significantly enhanced interaction of wt syt1-v <dig> with ps <dig> was observed in response to kcl. in contrast, 3d-a syt1-v <dig> binding to ps <dig> was significantly reduced compared to that of wt syt <dig> in kcl-treated cells . analogously, the interaction between mutant 3d-a syt1-v <dig> and ps <dig> in ca2+ ionophore-treated chinese hamster ovary  cells was significantly weaker compared to that of wt syt1-v <dig> and ps <dig> . these results support the importance of ca2+ binding to syt <dig> in the regulation of the ps1-syt <dig> interactions.fig.  <dig> mutations in syt <dig> at ca2+–binding aspartate residues disrupt ca2+-dependent syt1-ps <dig> interaction. a western blot analysis of the syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> from 1 % chapso lysed syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells transiently transfected with syt <dig> wt or syt <dig> d-a encoding vectors, following 15-minute 50 mm kcl  or water control  treatment. inp.- input cell lysate shows a comparable level of syt <dig> in cells transfected with wild type and 3d-a mutant syt <dig>  igg  or ps <dig> ct antibody was used for pull-down. b ps <dig> cho cells were transfected with syt <dig> wt or syt <dig> d-a expression plasmids, treated for 15 minutes with  <dig> μm ca2+ ionophore , and lysed in 1 % chapso buffer. ps1-syt <dig> complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-ps <dig> nt, anti-ps <dig> ct or anti-ps <dig> loop antibodies. the immunoprecipitation efficiency was determined by re-probing the membrane with ps <dig> antibodies used for pull-down. c quantitative analysis of the syt <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> from pc <dig>  and cho  in high calcium condition after kcl and calcium ionophore treatment, respectively. more syt <dig> wt than syt <dig> d-a was co-immunoprecipitated with ps <dig> in the above conditions. all the data are presented as mean ± sem. statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, *** p <  <dig> . syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  wt wild type, ct c-terminus, nt n-terminus, cho chinese hamster ovary



syt <dig> affects endogenous aβ production and ps <dig> conformation
the above data provide strong evidence that ca2+ influx promotes syt1-ps <dig> interactions and dynamically modulates ps <dig> conformation in neurons. therefore, we reasoned that syt <dig> might be involved in regulation of the aβ production/secretion and/or ps <dig> conformation. to gain insight into how syt <dig> may modulate aβ levels, we employed syt <dig> knockdown and overexpression approaches using parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells . aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> levels were reduced by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % , respectively, in syt <dig> kd cells . the deficits were partially rescued by transient syt1-v <dig> expression in syt <dig> kd cells. conversely, transient overexpression of syt1-v <dig> in parental pc <dig> cells led to increased levels of both aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % , respectively. of note, the levels of intracellular aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> were not significantly different between the parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells , suggesting that aβ generation may be impaired.fig.  <dig> aβ production/secretion and ps <dig> conformation are altered by syt <dig> kd. a, b elisa measurements of the endogenous  secreted and  intracellular aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells stimulated for 15 minutes with 50 mm kcl. the secreted aβ levels determined in pmol were normalized to the total protein extracted from the cells in the same well.  n =  <dig> for parental + syt1-v <dig> and n =  <dig> for all other conditions;  n =  <dig>  100 % equals to  <dig>  pmol/g and  <dig>  pmol/g for secreted aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  respectively. 100 % for intracellular aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> equals to  <dig>  pmol/g and  <dig>  pmol/g, respectively. c flim analysis of the fret efficiency  reflecting ps <dig> conformational changes in parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells; n =  <dig> cells for parental ca2+, n =  <dig> for parental ca2+, n =  <dig> for syt <dig> kd ca2+ and n =  <dig> for syt <dig> kd ca2+. higher values correspond to “closed” conformational state of ps <dig>  the cells were placed in ca2+/mg2+-free  or ca2+/mg2+-containing  medium, prior to treatment with 50 mm kcl. d elisa measurements of the endogenous aβ <dig>  aβ <dig> and aβ42/aβ <dig> ratio in the conditioned medium from parental and syt <dig> kd cells . e flim analysis of endogenous app and ps <dig> proximity  in parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells; n =  <dig> cells for parental ca2+, n =  <dig> for parental ca2+, n =  <dig> for syt <dig> kd ca2+ and n =  <dig> for syt <dig> kd ca2+. the cells were treated for 5 minutes with 50 mm kcl in ca2+/mg2+-free or normal medium, fixed, and immunostained for ps <dig> and app. the data in all panels of the figure are presented as mean ± sem. the statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test. *p <  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . aβ amyloid β, ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  flim fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, fret förster resonance energy transfer, app amyloid precursor protein



to test whether kcl/ca2+ influx-induced changes in ps <dig> conformation and aβ production/secretion observed in neurons  are mediated by syt <dig>  we monitored ps <dig> nt-loop proximity and aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> levels in parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells. the cells were transfected with g-ps1-r fret reporter and treated with kcl in regular or ca2+/mg2+ free media. similarly to neurons, a significant increase in the %efret was observed in parental pc <dig> cells in the regular, ca2+/mg2+-containing  media, indicating that kcl-triggered pathological “closed” ps <dig> conformation requires the presence of ca2+ ions . this corresponded to the kcl-induced increase in the aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> levels and the aβ42/ <dig> ratio in parental pc <dig> cells . on the contrary, no changes in ps <dig> conformation and aβ in response to ca2+ influx were detected in syt1kd cells. interestingly, whereas %efret  and the aβ42/ <dig> ratio  were not affected by calcium in syt <dig> kd, their baseline values were significantly higher in the absence of syt <dig>  these data suggest that, although the total level of aβ is reduced by syt <dig> kd, the presence of syt <dig> is required for the maintenance of the aβ42/ <dig> ratio and ps <dig> in the physiological, “normal” conformation.

since aβ levels were significantly reduced in syt <dig> kd cells, we tested whether interactions between app substrate and ps1/γ-secretase may be affected. we detected decreased proximity between the ps <dig> loop domain and app ct in syt <dig> kd cells, suggesting reduced ps1-app interaction in the absence of syt <dig> . in addition, while kcl treatment of parental pc <dig> cells increased %efret , it had no effect on the %efret in syt <dig> kd cells. taken together, these data suggest that syt <dig> may modulate aβ levels by influencing the assembly and/or activity of ps1/γ-secretase and its interaction with the app substrate.

syt <dig> modulates γ-secretase activity
a co-ip/western-blot analysis of the ps <dig> ctf co-immunoprecipitation with ps <dig> ntf and with the other γ-secretase components in parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells showed increased binding between ps <dig> ctf and ntf, as well as between ps <dig> and pen- <dig> and aph1a in the absence of syt <dig> . this indicates that syt <dig> deficiency affects γ-secretase architecture and promotes tighter association of its components. the finding is consistent with the more compact “closed” ps <dig> conformation in syt <dig> kd cells, as detected by the flim assay. at the same time, decreased levels of the ps <dig> n-terminal and c-terminal fragments along with the diminished pen- <dig> were detected in syt <dig> kd cells , suggesting reduction of the functional γ-secretase in the absence of syt <dig> fig.  <dig> syt <dig> influences the architecture of γ-secretase complex and aβ generation but not aicd production. a western blot analysis of the γ-secretase complex members co-immunoprecipitated from parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells lysed in 1 % chapso . the bottom gel shows the level of syt <dig> in the input lysates and after pull-down with ps <dig> c-terminal antibody or igg control. the graph presents quantitative analysis of the ps <dig> ntf, pen- <dig> and aph1a co-iped with the ps <dig> c-terminal fragments. the intensities of the bands were measured by densitometry, and adjusted to the intensity of the input bands and to the ps <dig> ctf . b quantitative analysis of the ps <dig> fl, ps <dig> ntf, ps <dig> ctf, and pen- <dig> in total protein extracts from parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells . the intensities of the bands were normalized to β actin levels. c cell-free γ-secretase activity assay using parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cell membrane preparations and recombinant c100-flag as a substrate. the amounts of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> were determined by sandwich elisa and normalized to the levels of ps <dig> ctf in the corresponding samples. the intensities of aicd-flag bands were measured by densitometry and normalized to ps <dig> ctf. the quantitative data in all panels are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> . syt <dig> synaptotagmin, aβ amyloid β, aicd app intracellular domain, app amyloid precursor protein, ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  ntf n-terminal fragment, pen- <dig> presenilin enhancer  <dig>  ip immunoprecipitation, ctf c-terminal fragment, fl full length



to test more directly if syt <dig> may affect ps1/γ-secretase activity, we performed a cell-free in vitro γ-secretase activity assay using recombinant c100-flag substrate  and membrane preparations from parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells containing active γ-secretase. a ~30 % reduction of the aβ <dig> production was detected in syt <dig> kd cells . a similar trend was recorded for aβ <dig> but the data did not reach statistical significance. these data confirm partial loss of γ-secretase catalytic activity in the absence of syt <dig>  of note, the app intracellular domain  level remained unaltered , supporting the hypothesis that γ-secretase cleavage of the app β-ctf occurs in a step-wise manner  <cit> , and loss of γ-secretase activity results in “incomplete digestion” of the app ctf substrate in syt <dig> kd cells. likewise, the γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of notch <dig> at the membrane-cytoplasm interface leading to generation of the notch <dig> intracellular domain  was not affected in the absence of syt <dig> in pc <dig> syt <dig> kd cells .fig.  <dig> notch <dig> intracellular domain  generation is not affected in syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells. parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells were transfected with myc-tagged, constitutively active notch <dig> with deleted extracellular domain , which is an immediate substrate of the γ-secretase. the cells were treated with dmso or γ-secretase inhibitor — dapt. transfection with a plasmid encoding notch <dig> intracellular domain  was used as a control. western blot analysis shows no difference in the production of the notch <dig> intracellular domain, as detected by anti-myc antibody, between parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells. data are presented as the nicd/nΔecd ratio; mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  statistical significance was determined using unpaired student t-test. syt <dig> synaptotagmin 1



syt <dig> modulates app processing
the role of syt <dig> in app processing was further investigated by analyzing the levels of endogenous app c-terminal fragments and secreted appβ  in the presence and absence of syt <dig> in pc <dig> cells. about a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  decrease in the total app ctf/fl ratio was observed in syt <dig> kd cells, suggesting that α- and/or β-secretase cleavage of app may be affected . indeed, the sappβ/app fl ratio was decreased by about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  in the absence of syt <dig> . on the other hand, in cho cells lacking endogenous syt <dig> but stably overexpressing human app and syt1-v <dig> or only app, the app ctf/app fl, sappα/app fl, and sappβ/app fl ratios were significantly increased in cells overexpressing syt <dig> .fig.  <dig> app ctf and sappβ production are reduced in the absence of syt <dig>  western blot analysis of the app processing in pc <dig>  and cho  cells. the levels of sappβ, sappα, and app ctfs  were normalized to fl app. data are presented as mean ± sem,  n =  <dig> for app ctf and n =  <dig> for sappβ,  n =  <dig> for app ctf, n =  <dig> for sappα, n =  <dig> for sappβ. statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> . app amyloid precursor protein, sappβ secreted appβ, syt <dig> synaptotagmin  <dig>  cho chinese hamster ovary cells, ctf c-terminal fragment, fl full length



bace <dig> maturation and degradation are affected in syt <dig> kd cells
the reduced amount of sappβ suggests that in addition to the γ-secretase activity, bace <dig> activity may also be affected in syt <dig> kd cells. indeed, the level of endogenous total bace <dig> was significantly decreased, whereas the level of immature bace <dig> detected by prodomain-specific antibody was increased in syt <dig> kd cells, relative to that in parental pc <dig> cells. thus, the total/immature bace <dig> ratio was reduced by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  in the absence of syt <dig> .fig.  <dig> syt <dig> modulates bace <dig> maturation and stability. a levels of total and immature bace <dig> in protein lysates from parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells were determined by western blotting using anti-bace <dig> antibodies directed against the c-terminus or prodomain of bace <dig>  respectively . the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed using overexpression of human bace <dig> in cho cells  and brain lysates from bace <dig> ko and control littermate mice . the intensities of all bace <dig> bands were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the levels of β actin. data are presented as mean ± sem. statistical significance was determined using unpaired student t-test. ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> . b analysis of bace <dig> degradation. parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells were treated with cycloheximide and harvested  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 hours after the treatment . western blot presents bace <dig> expression over time. anti-bace <dig> c-terminal antibody was used for detection. the quantitative analysis of bace <dig> levels revealed a significantly reduced half-life of bace <dig> in syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells compared to the parental pc <dig> control . statistical significance was determined using 2-way anova with bonferroni post-test, *** p <  <dig> 



the low levels of mature bace <dig> were at least partially due to a drastic reduction in the bace <dig> protein half-life in syt <dig> kd cells, as revealed by the cycloheximide pulse chase assay . of note, no difference in the stability of ps <dig> ctf and app between parental and syt <dig> kd cells was observed .

syt <dig> affects localization of app processing enzymes
to determine whether syt <dig> may modulate aβ production by influencing trafficking of bace <dig>  ps1/γ-secretase, or app, we analyzed their distribution in the parental and syt <dig> kd pc <dig> cells using subcellular fractionation . we found that lack of syt <dig> affects trafficking of ps <dig> ctf and bace <dig> but not app. the ps <dig> ctf has been retained within the earlier secretory compartments in syt <dig> kd cells. on the other hand, the distribution of bace <dig> has shifted towards the trans-golgi network in the absence of syt <dig> fig.  <dig> subcellular compartmentalization of ps <dig>  app, and bace <dig> in the presence and absence of syt <dig>  a western blots show distribution of ps <dig>  app, and bace <dig> in  <dig> subcellular fractions from parental and syt <dig> kd cells. the arrows indicate a shift in the subcellular distribution in syt <dig> kd cells. the enrichment of the respective subcellular compartments was determined by western blotting with anti-calreticulin, anti-gm <dig>  anti-tgn <dig>  and anti-rab <dig> antibodies. the fractions that correspond to the respective intracellular compartments are indicated above the western blots. b bar graphs present quantitative analysis of the ps <dig>  app, and bace <dig> levels at the plasma membrane, in total protein lysates, and the ratio of plasma membrane/total protein. data are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig> for ps <dig> in the membrane fraction, n =  <dig> for ps <dig> in total lysate, n =  <dig> for app, and n =  <dig> for bace <dig>  statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test, * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . ps <dig> presenilin  <dig>  app amyloid precursor protein, bace <dig> β-secretase  <dig>  syt <dig> synaptotagmin 1



the cell-surface biotinylation approach revealed a significantly reduced amount of bace <dig> and ps <dig> ctf on the surface of syt <dig> kd cells as compared to parental pc <dig> cells . however, since the levels of mature, functionally active γ-secretase  and bace <dig> were considerably reduced in the absence of syt <dig>  we calculated the ratio of plasma membrane to total level for each of the proteins. the adjusted values were not significantly different between the cell lines, although there was a trend towards reduced ps <dig> ctf plasma membrane/total ratio in syt <dig> kd cells, suggesting that the impaired intracellular transport of ps <dig> might cause this slight reduction of the ps1/γ-secretase at the cell surface.

to determine if the observed mislocalization of ps <dig> and bace <dig> in the absence of syt <dig> was due to a broader effect of the syt <dig> kd on protein trafficking, we analyzed subcellular distribution of another synaptic protein, synaptophysin , as well as other γ-secretase members/transmembrane proteins, nct and pen- <dig>  in syt <dig> kd and parental pc <dig> cell lines . no major differences in the abundance of the target proteins within the respective fractions were observed between the cell lines. furthermore, the overall transport fidelity was not noticeably altered by the lack of syt <dig>  as shown by comparable distribution of the compartment specific markers within the respective fractions in pc <dig> cells with and without syt <dig> . this further reaffirms that syt <dig> selectively affects ps <dig> and bace <dig>  and that their misdistribution is not due to impairments in the overall intracellular transport fidelity in the syt <dig> kd cells.

syt <dig> is unlikely a substrate for ps1/γ-secretase
since syt <dig> has a relatively short n terminus, single-pass transmembrane domain and a larger cytoplasmic region, a structure similar to the previously known ps1/γ-secretase substrates, we tested if syt <dig> may be a novel γ-secretase substrate. there was no difference in the levels of syt <dig> and its proteolytic fragments between dmso- and γ-secretase inhibitors-treated primary neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts , or in mefs lacking ps1/ps <dig> . hence, it is unlikely that syt <dig> is a ps1/γ-secretase substrate.

discussion
synaptotagmin  <dig> , a synaptic vesicle associated protein, was identified as a novel ca2+-dependent binding partner of presenilin  <dig> . moreover, a new role of syt <dig> in modulation of the ps <dig> conformation and aβ production via several mechanisms was revealed.

the ca2+-dependent profile of ps <dig> binding to syt <dig> suggests that ca2+ may function as a switch controlling ps <dig> interaction with the synaptic vesicle  protein intimately involved in sv exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. an involvement of presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmission was shown by zhang et al.  <cit> , reporting ca2+-linked impairment of synaptic facilitation and neurotransmitter release as a result of selective pre- but not post-synaptic inactivation of ps1/ <dig>  together, these findings suggest that ps <dig> may be involved in regulation of the neurotransmitter release via ca2+-triggered interaction with syt <dig>  in addition, our study shows that since presynaptic terminals are the major sites of the ca2+-induced interaction in neurons, as determined by flim , syt <dig> might play a role in modulation of the aβ production/secretion locally at the synaptic terminals. this does not, however, exclude the role of syt <dig> in aβ production away from the synapse and/or in a ps1-independent manner.

synaptic activity and ca2+ flux are tightly linked to aβ production  but the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of the aβ production at the synapse remain elusive. a sustained release of the neurotoxic aβ <dig> species in response to stimulation of isolated nerve terminals  <cit> , and deposition of oligomeric aβ at the excitatory synapses in the brain were reported  <cit> . the formation of aβ oligomers and their neurotoxicity depends not only on the increased amount of aβ but more importantly on the aβ42/ <dig> ratio  <cit> . familiar ad causing mutations in ps <dig>  ps <dig>  or app consistently increase the relative ratio between the aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> peptides, irrespective of the individual levels of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> . we have previously reported that increased aβ42/ <dig> ratio is tightly linked to pathogenic “closed” conformation of ps <dig>  <cit> . concomitant with these findings, our current study demonstrates that continuous neuronal activation and elevated intracellular calcium induce pathogenic “closed” conformation of ps <dig>  and provide a mechanistic explanation of the observed targeted accumulation of aβ oligomers at the synapse.

structural changes in ps <dig> are observed during normal aging, they precede aβ plaque deposition, and are exacerbated in sporadic ad brains  <cit> . we propose that ps1/γ-secretase exists in a dynamic equilibrium of different conformational states, which we call “closed” and “open” based on the fret measurements, that may modulate ps <dig> function  <cit> . although it is possible that familial ad  mutations in ps <dig>  <cit>  or recruitment of aph1b isoform  <cit>  produce more stable γ-secretase complexes with ps <dig> in pathogenic “closed” conformation, our current study shows that allosteric changes in the pre-existing γ-secretase complexes can occur in response to ca2+. importantly, these changes are reversible, as shown after a brief puff of glutamate, and closely correlate with the cytosolic ca2+ level. we demonstrate that in addition to promoting “closed” ps <dig> conformation, prolonged depolarization of neurons and continuing high intracellular ca2+ also increased the level of both aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> and, importantly, led to an increased aβ42/ <dig> ratio. these data are consistent with kim et al.  <cit>  reporting a similar increase in aβ <dig> levels after kcl-induced depolarization of isolated nerve terminals, synaptoneurosomes, and are in line with the early detection of aβ deposits in the default mode network of asymptomatic older adults  <cit> . interestingly, a spike-burst stimulation of hippocampal neurons increased release of only aβ <dig> but not aβ <dig>  accompanied by ps <dig> conformational changes consistent with reduced fret efficiency  <cit> . these data suggest that diverse stimuli and/or their duration may have different outcomes, with continued activation and/or persistent high calcium inducing pathogenic change in ps1/γ-secretase and elevated aβ42/ <dig> ratio that would ultimately lead to aβ deposition in the brain.

our current study reveals that syt <dig> may be required for the maintenance of the physiological “open” ps <dig> conformation, as pathogenic conformational change of ps <dig> was detected in the absence of syt <dig>  consistent with the ps <dig> conformational change, the ratio of aβ <dig> to aβ <dig> was elevated in syt <dig> kd cells, although the level of both aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> was significantly reduced in the absence of endogenous syt <dig> and increased by transient syt1-v <dig> overexpression. this is consistent with our findings in stably syt <dig> transfected pc <dig> and cho cells  <cit> . interestingly, whereas kcl treatment induced ps <dig> conformational change and triggered aβ production in neurons and parental pc <dig> cells, it had no effect on either in syt <dig> kd cells. thus, it is highly likely that in addition to its role in exocytosis, syt <dig>  presenting a strong and specific synaptic expression pattern in neurons, may also modulate aβ production/secretion locally at the synaptic terminals.

we identified several molecular mechanisms that underlie syt1-mediated regulation of aβ, both ps <dig> interaction-dependent and independent. syt <dig> and its interaction with ps <dig> may be needed for maintaining ps <dig> in the “open” conformation, and modulation of specific aβ species produced. we observed tighter association of the γ-secretase components , diminished amount of ps <dig> ntf/ctf, and reduced γ-secretase activity in syt <dig> kd compared to parental cells, indicating that architecture and activity of the γ-secretase complex are impaired in the absence of syt <dig>  importantly, whereas aβ production was reduced by syt <dig> kd, the ps1/γ-secretase dependent epsilon and s <dig> cleavages, responsible for aicd and nicd generation, respectively, were not affected. this finding is consistent with the step-wise γ-secretase cleavage model that proposes a three amino acid spaced cleavage mechanism for γ-secretase mediated intramembrane proteolysis  <cit> . the effect of syt <dig> kd is also in agreement with the proposed γ-secretase loss-of-function due to familial ad mutations in ps <dig>  which also display “closed” conformation and biochemically result in a partial loss of the γ-secretase activity due to inability of ‘complete digestion’ of the app substrate, generating fewer but longer aβs .

calcium binding to syt <dig> activates sv release machinery  <cit>  and, hence, may promote exocytosis of aβ at the synapse. indeed, active ps1/γ-secretase complex, app and bace <dig> were found in svs enabling aβ production within the vesicles .

moreover, we found that syt <dig> knockdown selectively impairs intracellular trafficking of ps <dig> and bace <dig> and, thus, may affect aβ via trafficking abnormalities and away from the synapse. syt <dig> is also a direct binding partner of app  <cit>  and, therefore, may regulate app processing by acting as a chaperon for app and/or ps <dig>  influencing their subcellular localization, alignment and interaction. indeed, our flim assay revealed diminished app-ps <dig> proximity in the absence of syt <dig>  which could be due to observed mislocalization of ps <dig> in the syt <dig> kd cells. finally, we demonstrate that syt <dig> expression is crucial for localization, maturation, and stability of bace1; thus, it may also modulate earlier steps of the app processing. we found that the subcellular localization of bace <dig> but not app is altered in the absence of syt <dig>  this is consistent with other studies showing that trafficking of app and bace <dig>  namely surface-to-endosome transport and sorting, could be distinctly regulated within the cell . it should also be mentioned that since ps <dig> is involved in bace <dig> maturation  <cit> , there is a possibility that affected ps <dig> function in syt <dig> kd has a downstream effect on bace <dig> 

taken together these findings provide compelling evidence supporting a role of syt <dig> in aβ production. namely, in addition to facilitation of the aβ secretion via exocytosis, syt <dig> plays a direct role in the activity-mediated regulation of app processing by:  modulating ps1/γ-secretase conformation, catalytic activity, and interactions with app;  affecting bace <dig> maturation and stability; and  mediating bace <dig> and ps <dig> subcellular compartmentalization.

the discovery of the novel ca2+-dependent interactions between ps <dig> and syt <dig> links several well-established players implicated in ad pathogenesis, such as elevated ca2+, structural changes in ps1/γ-secretase, and toxic aβ <dig> specie generation with synaptic proteins critical for sv/neurotransmitter release. it also provides strong evidence for syt <dig> being a ca2+-sensitive modulator of the ps1/γ-secretase, app processing, and consequent aβ production and deposition at the pre-synapse, suggesting a new role for syt <dig> in neurodegeneration. lack of the syt <dig> effect on notch <dig> icd generation may encourage novel synapse-specific therapeutic strategies targeting syt1-ps <dig> interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
synaptic loss caused by local accumulation of the oligomeric amyloid β  is the strongest and the earliest correlate of alzheimer’s disease dementia. however, events and proteins that influence synaptic aβ accumulation are poorly understood. in a search for early modifiers of the synaptic aβ we identified synaptic protein, synaptotagmin  <dig> , as a novel calcium-regulated interactor of the aβ cleaving enzyme, presenilin  <dig> /γ-secretase. we found that syt <dig> may function as activity-dependent regulator of the synaptic aβ by modulating ps <dig> catalytic activity and conformational state, bace <dig> maturation and stability. these novel discoveries provide a mechanistic link between major players implicated in ad pathogenesis: high calcium, toxic aβ <dig> specie, ps1/γ-secretase conformational changes, and synapse. furthermore, these findings may open avenues for new, synapse-targeting therapeutic strategies to halt the alzheimer’s disease progression.
