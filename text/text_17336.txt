BACKGROUND
a variety of different transcription factors are involved in the execution of genetic programs, and sequence-specific dna binding is a hallmark of transcriptional regulation. central to their role as gene-specific transcription factors is their ability to recognize distinct elements in the promoter regions of responsive genes. typically, transcription factors bind with high affinity and specificity to short motifs of dna via protein surfaces that are complementary to a particular base sequence. although there is often some flexibility in the nucleotide sequence that is recognized, certain key bases are crucial for interactions with the dna-binding domain. the stat  proteins constitute a paradigmatic family of evolutionary conserved transcription factors with a modular domain arrangement
 <cit> . in mammals, seven different members of the stat family are expressed, all of which consist of three proteolytically separable structural subunits. an amino-terminal domain is separated by a protease-sensitive linker peptide from a large core structure containing the central dna-binding domain and a carboxy-terminal transactivation domain
 <cit> . the amino-terminal domain of about  <dig> residues is folded into a unique hook-shaped architecture that facilitates cooperative dna binding through the formation of tetramers
 <cit> . the large core domain encompasses several distinct functional domains beginning at the amino-terminal end with a coiled-coil domain, which is engaged in protein-protein interactions
 <cit> . the dna-binding domain displays an immunoglobulin fold and is required for the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat dimers to semi-palindromic dna sequences termed gamma-activated sites 
 <cit> . the neighboring linker region consists of a unique all-alpha helical structure and assists in binding to gas elements
 <cit> . the src homology  <dig>  domain mediates recruitment to phospho-tyrosyl residues in the intracellular receptor tails and the formation of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat dimers
 <cit> . the carboxy terminus containing the transactivation domain is most variable in size and sequence among the different stat family members and is frequently subjected to alternative splicing
 <cit> .

the stats are best known for their function as cytokine-activated transcription factors, which play a vital role in such diverse processes as growth control, proliferation, and immune activation
 <cit> . the triggering of cytokine receptors initiates a cascade of phosphorylation steps that causes auto-phosphorylation of non-covalently attached jak kinases. the activated jak kinases then phosphorylate signature tyrosine residues in the intracellular receptor tails, thereby, creating phospho-tyrosine docking sites for the stat sh <dig> domain
 <cit> . phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue in the stat carboxy terminus results in a structural change within the stat dimer that shifts from an “antiparallel” to a dna-bound “parallel” conformation
 <cit> . tyrosine-phosphorylated stat enters the nucleus via importin-α/β-mediated transport
 <cit>  and binds to semi-palindromic gas elements in the promoter region of cytokine-responsive genes that contain the consensus sequence 5′-ttc3-4gaa-′3
 <cit> . stat proteins are then dephosphorylated by nuclear tyrosine phosphatases, some of which have been identified, such as the tc <dig> phosphatase for inactivation of stat1
 <cit> . additionally, unphosphorylated stat <dig> molecules translocate constitutively between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in both directions through direct contacts with nucleoporins located in the nuclear pore complex
 <cit> .

in contrast to this high-affinity gas binding, much less is known about the molecular processes that ensure the release of stat <dig> dimers from dna. in the following, we report on a novel and simple mechanism that allows stat <dig> homodimers to disengage from dna. additionally, we show that a high dissociation rate from non-specific dna and a preserved sequence-specific discrimination between gas and non-gas sites are both required for optimal transcriptional activation. moreover, we directly confirm that dna-bound stat <dig> molecules are protected from dephosphorylation in vivo, pointing to the essential role of non-specific dna binding in the search for cytokine-regulated promoter elements.

RESULTS
mutation of two glutamyl residues in the dna-binding domain results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of stat1
in an effort to identify dna-binding mutants of stat <dig> with preserved gas recognition, we performed a mutational study on the stat <dig> molecule and generated numerous point mutants in the dna-binding domain. a critical glutamic acid residue at position  <dig> in the full-length protein was found to be conserved in stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> of the human stat family. structural data of the dna-bound stat <dig> dimer revealed that the carboxyl group of e <dig> has a distance of  <dig>  Å from the phosphodiester backbone of the co-crystallized dna double helix and that there is no other residue in the stat <dig> molecule to prevent its free access to dna . this exposed residue on the surface of the dna-binding domain was mutated to alanine and the corresponding mutant was expressed in hela and stat1-negative u3a cells by transfection with pstat1-gfp. stat1-e411a was normally expressed and no indication of structural instability was detected neither by western blotting  nor gelshift experiments . in response to stimulation of cells with interferon−γ, the e411a mutant was tyrosine-phosphorylated  and bound to a single optimal gas site in the m <dig> probe similar to the wild-type protein .
 <cit>  with the side chains of e <dig> and e <dig> pointing towards the backbone of dna .  hyperphosphorylation of stat1-e411a upon stimulation of cells with increasing concentrations of ifnγ. equal cell numbers of hela cells expressing either wild-type or mutant stat <dig>  both tagged with green fluorescent protein , were exposed to increasing concentrations of ifnγ for  <dig> min before tyrosine phosphorylation was tested for in cell lysates. a representative result from a western blot experiment with a stat1-specific phospho-tyrosine antibody  and the corresponding re-blot after the stripping off of bound immunoreactivity and re-incubation with pan-stat <dig> antibody c- <dig>  is shown. the upper band on each blot marks recombinant gfp-tagged stat <dig>  whereas the lower band corresponds to native stat <dig>   decreased tyrosine dephosphorylation of stat1-e411a upon inhibition of kinase activity. equal numbers of u3a cells expressing wild-type or mutant stat <dig> were prestimulated for  <dig> min with  <dig> ng/ml ifnγ and subsequently exposed to  <dig> nm of the kinase blocker staurosporine for the durations indicated. note that staurosporine treatment resulted in the rapid loss of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1-wt, whereas the mutant was partially resistant to the inactivating staurosporine effect.  prolonged gas binding of stat1-e411a following treatment of ifnγ−prestimulated cells with staurosporine. u3a cells expressing either wild-type or mutant stat <dig> were stimulated for  <dig> min with ifnγ and thereafter the medium was replaced and the cells treated with  <dig> nm staurosporine. cell lysates were equilibrated with radioactively labeled dna containing a high-affinity stat binding site  before being loaded onto a gel. a representative gel-shift including two lanes with supershifts using either anti-stat <dig>  or anti-stat <dig>  antibody, respectively, is shown.  stat1-e421k resists dephosphorylation as determined by gelshift assay using extracts from ifnγ−prestimulated u3a cells that have been exposed to staurosporine for the indicated times.  tetramer stabilization of the e411a mutant. extracts from ifnγ−stimulated u3a cells expressing either wild-type or mutant stat <dig> were incubated in vitro with -labeled dna containing a tandem gas site. the reactions were either left unchallenged  or challenged for  <dig> min with a 750-fold molar excess of a single, unlabeled gas site . at the margin of the emsa gel the positions of tetrameric  and dimeric  stat <dig> are marked.

we then performed kinetic studies on tyrosine dephos-phorylation in ifnγ−prestimulated u3a cells which were subsequently exposed to  <dig> nm of the potent atp-competitive kinase blocker staurosporine
 <cit> . treatment with the kinase inhibitor resulted in a rapid and complete dephosphorylation of wild-type stat <dig> within  <dig> min, while the e411a mutant exhibited a much lower dephosphorylation rate . moreover, the ratio of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> to the total intracellular stat <dig> pool, which also contained unphosphorylated protein, was elevated in the mutant as compared to its wild-type counterpart . similarly, mutation of another glutamic acid residue in position  <dig>  which also points with its side chain in the direction of the dna double helix , resulted in defective dephosphorylation and increased dna-binding activity .

when we tested for cooperative dna binding resulting from the ability to form stable tetramers on tandem gas sites by means of emsa analysis, we found no significant difference between the wild-type and mutant stat <dig> . both variants bound independently to either gas site, resulting in both fast migrating stat1/dna complexes containing a single stat <dig> dimer and slow migrating complexes with two dimers. when such complexes were challenged with a 750-fold molar excess of unlabeled m <dig> duplex oligonucleotides, the tetrameric complexes resisted displacement due to stable tetramerization. in contrast, the dimeric complexes of both wild-type and mutant stat <dig> were either totally or partially displaced, indicative of cooperative dna binding. thus, substitution of either of the two conserved glutamyl residues in position  <dig> or  <dig> of the full-length stat <dig> molecule critically impaired the continuous dephosphorylation/rephosphorylation cycle and resulted in elevated and prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation levels. however, binding to an optimal gas site as well as cooperative dna binding due to tetramer stabilization was unaltered.

tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1-e411a protects co-expressed endogenous stat <dig> from inactivation
the partial insensitivity of stat1-e411a towards the inhibitory effect of staurosporine was independent of the cell type, as prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation was also detected in hela cells . similar to the effect in u3a cells, stimulation with an equal concentration of ifnγ resulted in higher levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated mutant stat <dig> as compared to the wild-type. also in cytokine-stimulated hela cells, the ratio of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> to the total stat <dig> was increased, indicating that hyperphosphorylation reflects an inherent property of the mutant. in line with the altered kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation, we found that, also in hela cells, dna-binding activity to the m <dig> site was enhanced following  <dig> min of stimulation with ifnγ . moreover, in the presence of staurosporine the rate of dephosphorylation was decreased in the point mutant as compared to the wild-type, thus confirming that the mutant e411a displayed a prolonged state of dna binding .

interferon-prestimulated hela cells expressing endogenous stat <dig>  in addition to either the gfp fusion of wild-type stat <dig> or its gfp-tagged mutant, were subjected to the inhibitory effect of staurosporine. in cells expressing stat1-e411a-gfp, not only did the mutant phospho-protein resist staurosporine treatment much better, endogenous stat <dig> was also partially insensitive, as revealed by its prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation  and enhanced dna-binding activity . thus, the presence of the e411a substitution protects also co-expressed native stat <dig> protein from its rapid inactivation. this finding suggested that the mutant stat <dig> protein interacts with endogenous stat <dig> in a way that impairs access to the inactivating nuclear phosphatase.

diminished nuclear export of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1-e411a
we then tested whether the nucleocytoplasmic distribution differed between wild-type and the mutant . cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared from either unstimulated or ifnγ−stimulated hela cells expressing stat1-gfp fusion proteins and the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were subsequently probed by means of western blotting. it was found that, in nuclear extracts, the amount of phospho-stat <dig> was significantly higher for mutant stat <dig> as compared to the wild-type, and vice versa, in cytosolic extracts there was slightly more phosphorylated wild-type protein. thus, the concentration of phospho-stat <dig> in the nucleus was higher when the critical glutamyl residue was displaced by alanine, resulting in a more pronounced nuclear retention. again, the amount of endogenous phospho-stat <dig> was higher in hela cells expressing the e411a mutant as compared to its wild-type gfp fusion.

to confirm the altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties of the mutants by a different approach, we performed a permeabilized cell transport assay
 <cit>  . hela cells expressing gfp-tagged wild-type stat <dig> or the respective glutamyl mutants were stimulated for  <dig> min with ifnγ to induce nuclear accumulation of the recombinant fusion proteins. subsequently, the cells were either immediately fixed or incubated for  <dig> min with  <dig> μg/ml digitonin on ice before fixation. treatment with digitonin at this concentration selectively permeabilized the plasma membrane, thereby, releasing cytoplasmic proteins, while the integrity of the nuclear envelope remained intact. as expected, stimulation with ifnγ resulted in the nuclear accumulation of all gfp-tagged stat <dig> variants . however, permeabilization by digitonin completely abrogated the pre-existing nuclear presence of stat1-wt-gfp, while the two mutants remained accumulated in the nucleus . thus, the nuclear export rate of the mutants was critically reduced as compared to the wild-type protein.

by adding a transferable nuclear export signal  to gfp-tagged stat1
 <cit> , we have gathered further evidence for an altered dna binding of the mutants. in resting cells, stat1-nes-gfp showed a cytoplasmic redistribution as compared to the nearly pancellular localization of stat1-gfp, which resulted from enhanced nuclear export . also in contrast to stat1-wt, the nes adduct failed to accumulate in the nuclei of interferon-stimulated cells, because the enhanced nuclear export rate competed with nuclear retention on dna. interestingly, however, nuclear accumulation was fully restored in the additional presence of the e411a mutation. this observation clearly confirms that high-affinity dna-binding is the underlying phenotype of the e411a mutant.

the mutant e411a exhibits high-affinity gas binding and has a broad repertoire of non-optimal binding sites
we now performed experiments that were aimed at elucidating the molecular basis behind the altered activation/inactivation cycle of the two stat <dig> glutamyl mutants. putative mechanisms for hyperphosphorylation of stat <dig> variants include diminished nuclear import due to mutations in either the dimer-specific nuclear import signal or other regions of the stat <dig> molecule, which interact with importin-α, as well as altered binding kinetics to dna. stat <dig> mutants with impaired nuclear import are exposed to the high kinase activity and comparably low phosphatase activity in the cytosol
 <cit> , and a dna-binding mutant termed stat1-dnaplus has been described, which failed to recognize gas probes in gelshift assays
 <cit> . we found that the glutamyl mutants do not fall into either of these categories, since, upon cytokine stimulation of cells, the mutants were imported normally into the nucleus , thus ruling out defective nuclear accumulation as the cause for their hyperphosphorylation. furthermore, the mutants recognized gas elements in mobility shift assays, clearly distinguishing them from stat1-dnaplus, in which three other residues in the dna-binding domain were substituted for positively charged residues . the altered dna-binding kinetics of the glutamyl mutants was evident in competition experiments employing challenge with excess unlabeled gas oligonucleotides . these experiments clearly revealed that a dramatically reduced dissociation rate from dna constitutes their underlying phenotype. in the mutants, the release from optimal dna-binding sites was critically impaired, resulting in a longer half-life of gas-bound dimers as compared to wild-type stat <dig>  thus, the stability of preformed protein-dna complexes differed significantly between the two mutant stat <dig> proteins and their wild-type counterpart.

in order to compare the sequence requirement for dna binding between the e411a mutant and wild-type stat <dig>  we used non-optimal gas elements as molecular probes in mobility shift assays . both the wild-type and the mutant bound with high affinity to oligonucleotides containing a single gas site. however, stat1-e411a also reacted with a mutated probe which, due to the exchange of two base pairs, contained no consensus gas element. although binding to this 2x nongas probe was weaker than to either gas-nongas or tandem gas oligos, there was a detectable formation of dna-bound stat <dig> dimers not requiring an intact gas site for dna binding. thus, in the presence of excess unlabeled gas oligos, the e411a mutant bound to dna not only with a higher affinity than the wild-type molecule, but also showed a relaxed sequence requirement for interaction with dna.

in vitro dephosphorylation assays, using whole cell extracts from reconstituted u3a cells in the presence of the stat1-inactivating tc <dig> phosphatase, confirmed that the two glutamyl mutants are indeed dna-binding mutants . it has been shown that dna-bound stat <dig> is protected from dephosphorylation and barred from nuclear exit
 <cit> , and we report here that the glutamyl mutants but not the wild-type protein resisted tc45-catalyzed inactivation. these experiments collectively demonstrate that there must be a considerable amount of mutant phospho-stat <dig> interacting with genomic dna that does not participate in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and resists inactivation by nuclear phosphatases.

a low dissociation rate from dna results in prolonged cytokine-induced nuclear accumulation
the experiments presented thus far have shown that mutation of two critical glutamyl residues in the dna-binding domain results in high-affinity dna binding and defective tyrosine dephosphorylation of stat <dig> upon stimulation of cells with ifnγ. therefore, we wondered whether the resting distribution and the kinetics of cytokine-inducible nuclear accumulation differed between the mutant and wild-type stat <dig> variants. for these experiments, we additionally mutated the glutamyl acid residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in positively charged lysyl residues and found that the resulting two novel point mutants closely mimicked the corresponding alanine mutant as described above . the gfp fusion proteins of all three stat <dig> variants  demonstrated a similar localization in resting hela cells, namely a pancellular distribution with a slightly elevated cytoplasmic concentration . replacement of the native glutamic acid residues at position  <dig> and  <dig> was without effect on the cytokine-induced nuclear accumulation, since the tyrosine-phosphorylated gfp fusions were imported normally into the nuclear compartment. however, when ifnγ−prestimulated cells were subsequently treated for  <dig> min with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, a striking difference between the two point mutants and wild-type stat <dig> was detected. in hela cells expressing wild-type stat <dig>  staurosporine caused a rapid collapse of nuclear accumulation, while nuclear localization of the glutamyl mutants persisted despite the presence of staurosporine. thus, both point mutations significantly retarded the nuclear residence time of stat <dig>  but did not completely prevent the collapse of nuclear accumulation, since after  <dig> min of staurosporine exposure the former resting distribution of stat <dig> was again achieved . thus, not surprisingly, insensitivity to pharmacological kinase inactivation resulted not only in elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> , but also in a markedly prolonged phase of nuclear accumulation. additionally, we found that, in the absence of staurosporine, the nuclear retention time was considerably prolonged for the mutant stat <dig> proteins during ifnγ−induced stimulation .

to exclude the possibility that the differential nuclear accumulation kinetics seen for the glutamyl mutants is an artefact resulting from the presence of the gfp domain, we confirmed this finding by means of immunocytochemical staining in u3a cells expressing recombinant, untagged stat <dig> . similarly to the gfp adducts expressed in hela cells, the respective glutamyl mutants showed an unaltered resting distribution and accumulated normally in the nuclei of ifnγ−stimulated u3a cells. however, after  <dig> min of staurosporine addition to the cells, the mutant stat <dig> molecules were still predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas the resting distribution of the wild-type protein had already been restored at that time point. following  <dig> min of staurosporine exposure, the nuclear accumulation of both mutants had also collapsed, demonstrating that the dna-binding mutants were less sensitive to kinase inhibition. this finding in u3a cells confirmed that the reduced dephosphorylation rate and prolonged nuclear accumulation are inherent properties of the glutamyl mutants, which result directly from their slow off-rate from dna.

high-affinity dna binding crucially impairs transcriptional responses
the impact of high-affinity dna binding on gene transcription was next investigated. reporter gene assays were performed to assess the consequence of a decreased dissociation rate from dna on gene expression. using a luciferase reporter with a synthetic promoter containing three strong gas sites separated by  <dig> bp , we found that all stat <dig> variants tested displayed transcriptional responses upon stimulation of reconstituted u3a cells with ifnγ . however, reporter gene induction was significantly repressed in cells expressing either of the glutamyl mutants as compared to the wild-type protein. stat1-e411k displayed the lowest reporter gene activation of the mutants under investigation, demonstrating that the transcriptional activity decreased from wild-type > e411a > e411k . similar results were also obtained for stat1-e421k using two reporters containing native fragments from the icam- <dig> promoter, termed pic <dig> and pic <dig> . thus, exchange of the negatively charged glutamyl acid residue at position  <dig> for either a neutral or positively charged amino acid stepwise diminished the transcriptional response on a reporter gene with a strong cytokine-driven promoter.

we then used real-time rt-pcr assays to probe the induction of three endogenous ifnγ−responsive genes in transfected u3a cells. again, the mutants failed to reach the transcriptional activity of the wild-type protein . while constitutively expressed recombinant stat <dig> mrna was detected in all samples as expected , there was a significant reduction in irf <dig> mrna synthesis in u3a cells expressing the e411k and e421k mutant as compared to wild-type stat <dig> . induction of the gbp <dig> and mig <dig> gene was also critically impaired or even completely abolished by replacing either of the glutamyl residues .

discussion
previously, it was shown by in vitro studies using purified stat <dig> that tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> dimers bound to dna are protected from the inhibitory activity of nuclear phosphatases and barred from nuclear exit
 <cit> . although the physiological significance of this finding remains unclear, it has been suggested that a slow off-rate from genomic dna critically compromises the stat′s functions as potent transcription factors for a limited number of target genes. the corresponding dna-binding mutants of stat <dig> created so far display either a decreased affinity for dna or a complete failure to discriminate between gas and non-gas elements. thus, not surprisingly, both resulted in defective transcriptional activity
 <cit> . however, the behavior of a hypothetical dna-binding mutant with preserved gas recognition and enhanced dna-binding affinity surpassing that of the wild-type protein has not been studied so far. it is surmised that such a dna-binding mutant would be a useful tool to dissect stat <dig> signal transduction in terms of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, cytokine-induced nuclear accumulation, and activation of target genes. as presented here, we have created such a point mutant which has allowed us to systematically investigate the transcriptional consequences of enhanced dna binding. using this mutant, we have revealed a simple molecular mechanism that enables stat dimers to dissociate from non-target dna in order to continue their search for gas sites. we have demonstrated that a high off-rate from genomic dna is required as a key feature for target gene finding, which allows for the efficient transmission of extracellular signals into transcriptional responses.

in an attempt to characterize the biological effects of increased protein-dna interactions at a transcriptional level, we performed a mutational study on stat <dig> and assessed the resulting mutants for their capability to bind sequence-specifically to dna and activate interferon-responsive target genes. most of the stat <dig> point mutants generated with substitutions in the dna-binding domain showed a reduced affinity for dna and were, therefore, inappropriate to test the functional consequences of high-affinity dna binding for gene expression. however, we identified two single point mutants that fulfilled our expectations for an enhanced binding to gas sites. replacement of two glutamic acid residues in the dna-binding domain, although not interfering with the recognition of gas elements, independently stabilizes preformed stat1-dna complexes. the presence of negatively charged residues at position  <dig> and  <dig> is required for the release of stat <dig> dimers from dna, as their substitution with either alanine or a positively charged lysyl residue remarkably reduced the dissociation rate from both gas and gas-like elements. the striking finding that enhanced gas binding is associated with a dramatically reduced gene expression in cytokine-stimulated cells clearly underlines the significance of intact nucleocytoplasmic shuttling for full transcriptional activation. moreover, it suggests that a limited residence time in the nucleus is an inherent property of stat <dig> signal transduction and, conversely, a reduced dissociation rate from gas elements results in suppressed gene induction.

available crystallographic data have revealed that the glutamyl residue  <dig> does not directly contact specific nucleotide bases or the sugar-phosphodiester backbone of dna, but in the dna-bound form it has nevertheless free access to the dna molecule, suggesting that there may be some minor structural flexibility within the stat <dig> dna-binding domain . it has been reported that residue  <dig> can accept hydrogen bonds from guanine in the minor groove, although the precise interface between the surface of the stat <dig> dna-binding domain and the dna double helix in the proximity to e <dig> is not known due to the superimposition of non-equivalent base pairs at these positions
 <cit> . the functional relevance of the two glutamyl residues can best be regarded as an off-switch to release stat <dig> dimers from dna, so that they become a readily accessible substrate for the inactivating nuclear phosphatase. the presence of a glutamic acid residue with a terminal carboxyl group adjacent to phosphate groups in the dna backbone facilitates the fast disassembly of stat1-dna complexes possibly via electrostatic repulsion. interestingly, these residues are directly engaged in the discrimination between canonical and non-canonical binding sites, since its replacement by alanine results in a mutant with preserved gas recognition and a broadened spectrum of potential binding sites . this finding suggests that the repulsive effect on dna binding exerted by these residues is independent of the underlying dna sequences and occurs at classical gas, gas-like or even non-gas sites. the native glutamyl residues seem to facilitate the release of stat <dig> dimers from dna via electrostatic interactions, thereby increasing the number of stat <dig> molecules participating in productive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.

in the wild-type molecule, the fast dissociation from dna contributes to the coupling of dna release and subsequent tyrosine dephosphorylation to transcriptional activation. under conditions of cytokine stimulation the fast release from dna ensures that the intracellular concentration of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> is always limited due to the high tyrosine phosphatase activity in the nucleoplasma. in the dna-binding mutants e411a/k and e421k, this coupling between the recruitment to genomic dna and their fast dephosphorylation is critically disturbed, since these mutants are more than the wild-type protein stacked on genomic dna in complexes, which may also contain co-expressed native stat <dig> . due to the reduced number of cycling stat <dig> dimers , their cytokine-induced transcriptional response is substantially limited . the prolonged nuclear residence time of the glutamyl mutants following cytokine stimulation of cells  appears to directly reflect their decreased tyrosine dephosphorylation , suggesting that they are retained in a dna-bound state at transcriptionally inert genomic loci. tyrosine-phosphorylated native stat <dig> molecules form heterodimers with the co-expressed recombinant stat <dig> mutants as detected by gelshift experiments , which are integrated into dna-bound stat complexes and protected from fast inactivation . thus, paradoxically, despite their increased gas binding and elevated concentration in the nuclear compartment, where transcription exclusively takes place, the mutants are nevertheless weaker transcriptional activators.

interestingly, by introducing a neutral or a positively charged functional group at position  <dig>  we generated a graduated series of stat <dig> variants  with stepwise diminished transcriptional activity at an artificial reporter gene construct. thus, changing the electric charge of this residue permits interference with gene induction simply by shifting the amount of stat <dig> dimers to a dna-bound state in which they are prevented from freely shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus. from our experiments, we cannot conclude whether the impaired transcriptional activity at native target genes detected for the mutants results from a diminished exchange rate at a single promoter or merely reflects decreased promoter occupancy due to predominant deposition at low-affinity dna-binding sites. however, we observed that cytokine stimulation leads to high nuclear concentrations of mutant stat <dig>  which clearly exceed that of the wild-type protein . this finding suggests that mutant stat <dig> preferentially deposits outside transcriptionally active sites. in this scenario, a limited number of high-affinity gas sites compete with the virtually unlimited amount of non-gas sequences within the entire genome for binding to stat <dig>  in interferon-stimulated cells, phospho-stat dimers retained in the nucleus may not be exclusively bound to gas sites, but are additionally recruited to an overwhelming reservoir of unspecific, low-affinity dna-binding sites, from which they are released with very high exchange rates 
 <cit> . interestingly, lerner and colleagues had previously shown that stat <dig> and glucocorticoid receptor assembled at the α2-macroglobulin promoter into an enhanceosome for which continued renewal of both transcription factors was required for full transcriptional activity 
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we present evidence showing that the presence of two single glutamic acid residues in the dna-binding domain adjacent to the dna backbone sequence-independently weakens the binding to dna and is required for full transcriptional activation of cytokine-driven target genes. the high dissociation rate from non-gas sites ensures that tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> dimers can successfully scan genomic dna for the presence of specific gas sites, at which they assemble into transcriptional active complexes until they are finally dephosphorylated for nuclear exit. furthermore, we demonstrate that not a high affinity for gas sites, but rather the inherent difference in the off-rates between specific and non-specific binding sites crucially determines the function of stat proteins as transcriptional regulators.
