BACKGROUND
over the past decade, a number of functional proteins have been produced successfully by recombinant dna methods  <cit> . the most commonly used host cell is escherichia coli  because of high yield and low cost  <cit> . however, high-level expression of recombinant proteins using e. coli as the host cell has been affected by some factors, such as the different preferential codons in different expression systems and various induction conditions of target protein  <cit> .

the interferons  are a family of protein with the ability to induce antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, and antiviral activities . for more than a decade, interferon therapy is the gold standard in treatment for certain forms of viral hepatitis and carcinogenesis  <cit> . however, therapeutic efficacy has been limited because interferon does not have organ-specific affinity and its in vivo half-life is short  <cit> . incorporation of plasmodium region i peptide was demonstrated to be a promising strategy for the development of liver-targeting drug  <cit> . in our previous study, a novel liver-targeting fusion interferon  combining ifn α2b with plasmodium region i peptide was successfully designed  <cit> . the results of in vitro anti-hepatitis b virus  activity of ifn-csp showed that ifn-csp has significant inhibition effects on hbv-dna replication in hepg <dig> . <dig> cells  <cit> . in vitro liver tissue binding analysis revealed that ifn-csp specific targeting to liver tissue  <cit> . ifn-csp may be an excellent candidate as a liver-targeting anti-hbv agent. however, the in vivo tissue distribution and anti-hbv activity of ifn-csp requires further investigate. moreover, it is desirable to produce ifn-csp in a large scale for therapeutic application.

the main purpose of the present investigation was focused on how to produce high levels of recombinant ifn-csp in a cost-effective way. we also investigated the in vivo tissue distribution and anti-hbv activity of ifn-csp. therefore, a modified dna fragment encoding the ifn-csp was synthesized by overlapping extension-pcr method according to e. coli preferred codon usage. the ifn-csp gene was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pet-21b and transferred into the expression strain e. coli bl <dig>  the suitable induction conditions were systematically optimized by combining one-factor experiments with an orthogonal experiment ). the antigenicity of the purified protein was characterized by western blot analysis. the in vivo tissue distribution were assayed and compared with native ifn α2b. hbv-transgenic mice were used as in vivo model to evaluate the anti-hbv effect of the recombinant ifn-csp.

methods
pasmids, strains and culture media
pmd20-t  was used for gene cloning. pet-21b  was employed to construct expression vector. e. coli strain dh5α  was applied as the host for gene manipulation. e. coli strain bl <dig>  served as expression host for fusion protein. luria-bertani  medium was used for bacterial growth and protein expression.

construction of the liver-targeting fusion interferon gene using e. coli preferred codon
to improve the expression level of ifn-csp in e. coli, a new ifn-csp coding sequence was designed. the optimized codons usage pattern of e. coli genes was employed according to the codon usage pattern of e. coli . based on the method of polymerase chain reaction -based gene synthesis and gene splicing by overlap extension, a modified three-step method  <cit> , called “splicing by overlapping extension-pcr ”, was adopted to construct the synthetic ifn-csp gene. we designed  <dig> oligonucleotides encoding for the ifn-csp protein. the sense and antisense oligonucleotides with  <dig> bp complementary overlapping sequence are presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides designed for assembly of ifn-csp*

discussion
the expression of heterologous proteins in e. coli is an attractive strategy to obtain the active form of protein in a large scale for therapeutic application. in our previous work, the strategy proved to be efficient to achieve high-level expression  <cit> . while, dna sequence analysis of genes encoding either high abundance or low abundance proteins in e. coli has revealed a pattern of favored codon usage  <cit> . lowly expressed genes show the greatest degree of conformity to the rare codons, which correspond to the rare trnas in the e. coli cell. so, it is necessary to analyze the dna sequence of ifn-csp before recombination expression using e. coli expression system.

the ifn-csp contains  <dig> amino acids, and  <dig> amino acids are encoded by the rare codons of e. coli. particularly, r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> were encoded by the least used codons, agg and aga, which were discovered to dramatically reduce the maximum level of protein synthesis. some examples show that codon optimization can significantly improve the expression level  <cit> . srivastava et al. reported that a codon optimized ifn α2b gene expressed as ib only about 40 % of the total protein  <cit> . valente et al. using an artificial ifn α2b gene that was codon optimized for its rare tandem arginine codons and its gene product was produced  <dig>  mg/l e. coli culture  <cit> . another investigation used e. coli codon optimized artificial gene produced his-ifn α2b in the form of ib - <dig> mg/l e. coli culture  <cit> . based on the above knowledge, we applied a codon optimization strategy to over-express ifn-csp fusion protein in e. coli. moreover, stop codon bias and context also correlates with the efficiency of translation  <cit> , so the preferred sequence of translation termination in e. coli, ‘taat’ was used.

the induction conditions will affect the expression level of target proteins as reported numerous times elsewhere  <cit> . for this reason, the induction conditions like cultivation temperature, induction timing, inducer concentrations, and induction time were also examined. in our previous study, we found that the fusion ifn-csp without any optimization expressed as ib only accounting for  <dig>  % of the total insoluble protein  <cit> . in the present, the highest expression level was achieved when the recombinant e. coli at the mid-exponential phase was effectively induced at 37 °c with  <dig>  mm iptg concentration for  <dig> h. although most of the ifn-csp protein in the current work was produced in the form of ib , this is the first report to show that the novel liver-targeting fusion interferon  was expressed in such high level, about  <dig>  % relative to total host proteins. using the improved purification scheme , the final yield of purified ifn-csp was up to  <dig> mg per l culture, which is  <dig> -fold higher than the previous investigation  <cit> . the purity and the molecular weight of purified ifn-csp were demonstrated by sds-page, rp-hplc and maldi-ms . the result of western blot analysis characterized the antigenicity of ifn-csp . biological activity analysis according to china biologicals requirements showed that ifn-csp had ability to inhibit the cytopathic effect caused by vsv on wish cells .fig.  <dig> protocol for the recovery of ifn-csp from e. coli inclusion bodies



in line with previous in vitro experiments, we have further evaluated the in vivo tissue distribution and anti-hbv activities of ifn-csp. in vivo tissue distribution assay showed that ifn-csp was able to accumulate in mouse liver compared to native ifn α2b . small animal models amenable to infection with human hepatotropic viruses are in great need for studying new anti-hbv drugs. the hbv-tg mouse lineage was initially produced on a balb/c background. the transgene in these mice consists of  <dig>  copies of the hbv ayw complete genome. the hbv-tg mice express high level of hbsag in their serum and have detectable hbv-dna in their serum, which allows hbv-dna replication, is an appropriate tool to evaluate anti-hbv drugs . in the present study, we found that the recombinant ifn-csp and native ifn α2b in vivo were able to reduce serum hbsag , hbv-dna  and liver hbv core protein  in hbv-transgenic mice. however, ifn-csp showed a significant improvement in anti-hbv activity when compared with native ifn α2b at similar doses. these results indicate that incorporation of plasmodium region i peptide can specifically target to liver, to achieve higher local concentrations and to improve their anti-hbv efficacy in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, synthetic codon optimized ifn-csp gene was overexpressed at high expression level and the purified protein was confirmed to ifn-csp based on the results of antigenicity and biological activity analysis. the purified ifn-csp was able to accumulate in mouse liver compared to native ifn α2b and reduce serum hbsag, hbv-dna and liver hbv core protein in hbv-transgenic mice. this current work reports for the first time that codon and expression conditions optimized approach is a strategy to produce ifn-csp at large scale, and would also be very helpful to produce other recombinant protein for further medical research. the present study further supported the application of ifn-csp in liver-targeting anti-hbv medicines.
