BACKGROUND

porphyromonas gingivalis , an anaerobic gram-negative rod, is a member of the oral bacterial biofilm and considered as an important etiologic agent of gingival and periodontal inflammation  <cit> . p. gingivalis is able to invade oral epithelial and endothelial cells  and effectively induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production of monocytes, neutrophils, as well as macrophages. it is also able to modify the functions of immune cells in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

epithelial cells not only provide a barrier against bacterial challenge and invasion but also participate in the innate immune defense. infection of epithelial cells by p. gingivalis activates signaling cascades that control transcription of target genes encoding for immune response and inflammatory reactions such as interleukin -1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor -α in monocytic and epithelial cells and interferon regulating factor   <dig> in oral epithelial cells .

pattern recognition receptors  recognize microbial components formed as pathogen-associated molecular patterns . pamps show structural similarities between a great numbers of microorganisms, thus different prrs usually recognize well-defined pamps. toll-like receptors  form a well-known prr family  <cit> . prrs are present on epithelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells   <cit> . activation of these receptors by pamps initiates the innate response to microbial challenge and induces adaptive immunity to clear infections  <cit> .

recent studies suggest that prrs are responsible for constant surveillance of the microbial colonization by detecting conserved microbial structures such as lipopolysaccharides   <cit> .

intracellular invasion of pathogens is recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain -like receptors  which are located in the cytoplasm. purinergic p2x receptors on the plasma membrane are activated by damaged cells  <cit> . ligation of the purinergic receptor, p2x <dig>  induces the assembly of the inflammasome, a protein complex of caspase- <dig> and an adaptor protein asc. activation of caspase- <dig> initiates the production and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and il- <dig>  the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein nlrp <dig> is the best studied nlr member. it contains a card  domain and the protease caspase- <dig>  <cit> .

gingival epithelial cells  may exhibit a functional nalp <dig> inflammasome. stimulation of gecs with lps or infection with p. gingivalis caused induction of the il-1β gene and accumulation of il-1β in the cells. however, il-1β release did not occur unless the lps-treated or infected cells were stimulated with adenosine triphosphate . gecs showed caspase- <dig> activation after treatment with atp  <cit> . p. gingivalis expresses a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase  homolog that is able to inhibit innate immune reaction caused by stimulation with extracellular atp. thus, p. gingivalis infection inhibits atp-induced caspase- <dig> activation in gecs. furthermore p. gingivalis ndk may modify high- mobility group protein b <dig>  release. hmgb <dig> is a pro-inflammatory danger signal that, in intact cells remains associated with chromatin. hmgb <dig> is released into the extracellular area after stimulation of uninfected gecs with atp instead of being translocated from the nucleus into the cytosol. in comparison to wild-type p. gingivalis higher amounts of hmgb <dig> are released when cells are infected with a ndk-deficient mutant stimulated with atp, suggesting that ndk is crucial in inhibiting the initiation of the p2x7-dependent inflammasome and hmgb <dig> release from infected gecs  <cit> .

gecs belong to the first host cells which encounter with colonizing oral bacteria. the bacterial–host communication is managed by signal transduction pathways, i.e. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  and tlr pathway that are activated by infection with fusobacterium nucleatum  and streptococcus gordonii and other bacteria of the oral biofilm .

molecules supporting antimicrobial clearance and the control of adaptive and innate immune responses are human beta-defensins  produced by various cell types. investigation of the macrophage cell line raw  <dig>  revealed that treatment with synthetic hbd3- <dig> peptide inhibited the lps-induced production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide. furthermore this treatment inhibited the production of secretory cytokines, such as il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor -α in cells stimulated with lps. this inhibition was found to be concentration-dependent. additionally, in a model of lung inflammation, hbd3- <dig> was shown to reduce interstitial infiltration by neutrophils. hbd3- <dig> was able to downregulate the nuclear factor-kappa b -dependent inflammatory response via direct suppression of the phosphorylated-nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells inhibitor alpha ﻿ degradation and downregulation of the p <dig> unit of activated nf-κb  <cit> .


p. gingivalis is capable of inducing immune tolerance in antigen-presenting cells  by desensitizing them against second activation, a process that involves induction of the expression of the tolerogenic molecules immunoglobulin-like transcript  <dig>  and b7-h <dig>  <cit> . it is known that t cell activation requires a co-stimulatory signal usually provided by apcs. this additional signal regulates activation or inhibition of t cell action.

in a previous study, we demonstrated that p. gingivalis induces b7-h <dig> expression in different carcinoma cell lines  as well as in primary human gingival keratinocytes  <cit> . the b7-h <dig> receptor  belongs to the b7-family exhibiting regulatory properties that modify cell-mediated immune reactions  <cit> . b7-h <dig> ligands are induced on activated t and b cells, on endothelial and epithelial cells as well as on macrophages. dendritic cells  and apcs exhibit constitutive b7-h1expression . the binding receptor for b7-h <dig> is the cd28/ctla- <dig> like programmed death- <dig>  receptor which is expressed on activated t cells, b cells, monocytes and macrophages. this molecule is a member of the immunoglobulin  superfamily  <cit> . signals mediated by b7-h <dig> are essential in regulating t cell activation and tolerance  <cit> , by inhibiting functions of activated t cells. pro-inflammatory cytokines i.e. interferon -γ are known to up-regulate b7-h <dig> expression  <cit> . activated t cells, b cells and monocytes show pd- <dig> expression  <cit> .

b7-h <dig> ligand binding triggers the development of regulatory t cells . this phenotype is essential in regulating peripheral tolerance by active suppression of effector t cells and inhibition of tissue damage caused by the inflammatory response . blockade of b7-h <dig> affected the inhibitory effect of treg  <cit> . additionally, blockade of b7-h1/pd- <dig> ligation abolished treg mediated immune-regulation  <cit> . this was demonstrated in a mouse model expressing a phenotype with b7-h <dig> deficiency that caused diminished treg cell differentiation in vivo  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. using bladder cancer cells, b7-h <dig> up-regulation was shown to be induced by tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> , and in oral langerhans cells activation of tlr <dig> caused induction of b7-h <dig> in vitro  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of a selected number of genes after infection with p. gingivalis. the study was conducted to analyze mechanisms that are induced in epithelial cells after bacterial challenge. the analysis was performed on genes coding for receptor activation, downstream signal transduction, apoptosis, inflammatory response, cytokines and chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides.

discussion
periodontitis is mainly caused by an oral microbial biofilm, however, progression of the disease is regulated by the immune-inflammatory reaction and the destruction of the teeth supporting tissues  <cit> . p. gingivalis plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and progression of periodontitis. among many different mechanisms, it has been shown that p. gingivalis differentially activates the nf-κb pathway. after infection with f. nucleatum the oral epithelial cell line h <dig> responded with activation of nfκb. however, a significantly higher number of nf-kb translocations into the nucleus were detected after h <dig> cell infection with f. nucleatum suggesting that these two periodontal pathogens have different molecular influences on these cells  <cit> . in human monocyte-derived macrophages, p. gingivalis gingipains induced secretion of tnf-α and il- <dig> and upon stimulation the amount of phosphorylated p38α mapk increased  <cit> .

upon stimulation of primary oral epithelial cells and carcinoma cells with bacterial fractions of p. gingivalis, a number of genes were conjointly up-regulated. the genes ikbkb, irak <dig>  irf <dig>  map2k <dig> , mapk <dig> , mapk <dig>  and nfkb <dig>  were upregulated not only in both cell types, but also after infection with whole bacteria of p. gingivalis w <dig> as well as with the membrane fraction. the cytosolic fraction didn’t induce altered gene expression . nf-kb <dig>  is a protein subunit of the nf-κb protein complex, a transcription factor central for a number of immunological and inflammatory reactions, including five subunit members – rela , relb, c-rel, p <dig>  and p <dig> with functions as homodimers and heterodimers  <cit> . the nf-κb transcription factors are dissociated in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors of κb, the iκbs. the iκb kinase  complex, including ikbkb, initiates the activation and is activated as well. further phosphorylation and disintegration of iκb protein results in activation of nf-κb  <cit> . mitogen-activated protein kinases  are a highly conserved family of ser/thr protein kinases in eukaryotes that are regulating a number of cellular activities such as managing cellular responses to cell stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

epithelial cells, such as gecs, are able to respond to bacterial challenge by initiation of a deliberated signaling network. the gecs express different receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. their activation induces innate immune reactions, including tlrs, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain receptors  and protease-activated receptors . it has been shown that surface receptors, such as tlrs and pars, are activated when corresponding bacterial motifs or proteases are detected. thus, activation of tlrs and pars leads to downstream activation of nf-κb and/or mapk pathways . activations of tlr and pars by membrane fractions induce the up-regulation of downstream signaling molecules that were detected in this study. the tlr family shares downstream signaling molecules, amongst them the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response protein kinases  <dig> , a shared adaptor protein of tlrs triggers the downstream pathways like nf-κb and mapk cascades  <cit> . among the mapk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig> , c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig>  kinases have been intensively studied, from which jnk and p <dig> kinases show a higher responsiveness  <cit> .

in human oral keratinocytes  it was demonstrated that p. gingivalis lps could activate both p <dig> and jnk pathways by inducing phosphorylation of iκba and p <dig> transcription factors. these results indicate that induction of lps binding protein  expression in hoks by p. gingivalis lps involves nf-κb and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways <cit> . further members of the mapk family are mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and c-jun nh <dig> terminal kinase  <dig> . after stimulation, activated tlr <dig> may initiate a cascade activation of mapks including mek <dig>  <cit> . jnk <dig> is a downstream target of mek <dig>  <cit> . in a human lung carcinoma type ii epithelial cell line  stimulation with lps enhanced phosphorylation of mek  <dig> and jnk <dig> in a time-dependent manner  <cit> .

the results of our study demonstrate that p. gingivalis and its membrane fraction, induced rna up-regulation of the nf-κb and p <dig> mapk, mek4-jnk <dig> signaling pathways. furthermore, it was shown that a malignant oral epithelial cell line responded in a similar manner as non-transformed oral keratinocytes. these results are interesting since p <dig> mapk and mek4-jnk <dig> signaling pathways are known to be involved in tumor microenvironment and cancer growth control.

head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  tissues express high levels of active p <dig> and the blockade of its signaling pathway caused significant inhibition of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  proliferation  <cit> . stromal fibroblasts of a variety of invasive malignant tumors express collagenase- <dig> -1), which was shown to correlate with the activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase  and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of c-jun. it was also demonstrated that jnk <dig> is required for induction of fibroblast collagenase-3expression  <cit> .

the data of the present study show a possible link between infection with p. gingivalis and oral squamous cell carcinomas, considering that periodontal disease has been associated with the risk for oral tumors  <cit> .

huynh et al.  reported that in human oral epithelial cells interleukin regulation factor   <dig> expression was strongly up-regulated upon challenge with p. gingivalis. irf <dig> thus is acting downstream of il- <dig> receptor –associated kinase  <dig> to induce the expression of the il- <dig> family cytokine il- <dig> gamma responding to p. gingivalis  <cit> . the transcription factor irf <dig> is a co-regulator of ifn-β  <cit>  that exhibits a number of functions, including virus-mediated activation of interferon  <cit> . the results of the profiler array analysis showed up-regulation of irf <dig> in scc- <dig> cells by membrane fractions, as well as by whole bacteria . these results were confirmed by quantitative real time pcr assays. these results suggest that irfs presumably support inflammatory processes upon infection with p. gingivalis.

CONCLUSIONS
in malignant and primary human oral epithelial cells, p. gingivalis and its membrane fraction induced up-regulation of a number of genes. these genes are involved in the downstream signaling pathway of the pro-inflammatory active transcription factor nf-κb and some members of the mapk family. these kinases participate in the downstream signaling pathway for gene induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are involved in cancer proliferation and control.
