BACKGROUND
activation of t helper  <dig>  cells leads to differentiation into several lineages. these lineages include the th <dig> and th <dig> subsets as well as the more recently described subsets such as induced t regulatory cells and th <dig> cells. the th <dig> cells protect against intracellular pathogens and are in general characterized by their ability to produce ifnγ, il- <dig> and tnfα and express the th1-specific transcription factor t-bet. the th <dig> subset, which is involved in the defense against extracellular pathogens, is characterized by the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> and is controlled by the master transcription factor gata <dig>  <cit> .

in a proper functioning immune system, these different t helper subsets are well-balanced and co-operate to eliminate invading pathogens and to maintain homeostasis. hyper activation of one t helper subset, however, can tip the balance from health towards disease, in which th2-overshoot can lead to inappropriate immune responses leading to diseases like allergy and asthma. alternatively, overshoot towards a th <dig> or th17-phenotype can cause autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis  <cit> .

for effective cd <dig> t cell activation, the antigen-presenting cell  provides a key contact point to facilitate t cell activation and polarization towards different t helper subsets. a crucial event in this process is the interaction between the antigen presented via the mhcii receptor and the tcr receptor . the nature of activation, defined by the strength of the tcr stimulation, can affect t helper cell polarization towards th <dig> or th <dig>  in which a high affinity interaction favors th <dig> development and low affinity drives th <dig> development  <cit> . besides the tcr signal transduction, an additional signal is provided by the apc in the form of a co-stimulatory signal . this signal is provided via cd28-b <dig> interaction and has been shown to be important for effective t cell activation  <cit> . furthermore, cd28-mediated co-stimulation has been implicated in effective polarization of t cells towards a th <dig> phenotype  <cit> . also other co-stimulatory molecules, including icos and ox <dig>  have been positively correlated with th <dig> differentiation  <cit> . the results from these studies underline the importance of both signal  <dig> and signal  <dig>  but also underline the complexity of these integrated signaling pathways.

the cascade of biochemical events, linking cell surface receptor engagement to cellular responses has been a focus of many studies. detailed investigation of these signal transduction events has led to identification and functional characterization of many kinases and phosphatases downstream of the tcr and cd28-receptor. tcr ligation results in the recruitment of p56lck , a proximal tcr src family kinase, which kick-starts the signal transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation of the itam motifs in the tcr, which recruits and activates zap <dig>  <cit> . this initial step leads to the activation of plcγ that hydrolyzes pip <dig> into ip <dig>  which is the second messenger molecule responsible for the sustained intracellular calcium flux in t cells. cd28-ligation on t cells results in the recruitment of pi3k, with pip <dig> and pip <dig>  which serve as pleckstrin homology  domain membrane anchors. via this mechanism pdk <dig> and pkb/akt are recruited and regulate several pathways that increase cellular metabolism  <cit> . additionally, cd28-signaling has been shown to initiate nfκb signaling, via a mechanism that is functionally linked through recruitment of pkcθ to cd <dig> in the immunological synapse  <cit> .

members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, which can be activated via tcr signaling, also play a role in the differentiation of th <dig> and th <dig> subsets. in a thorough review by dong et al., the role of p <dig>  jnk and erk in t helper cell differentiation has been outlined  <cit> . erk is important for th <dig> differentiation, whereas p <dig> and jnk <dig> appear to be involved in th <dig> development.

tcr/cd <dig> stimulation and cd <dig> stimulation alone are weak activators of t cell signaling. it is generally conceived that cd <dig> signaling merely acts as a signal potentiator on top of the initiator signal mediated via the tcr/cd <dig>  ledbetter and june et al. described that cd <dig> stimulation in the absence of cross-linking on top of pma stimulation can activate t cells, without increasing calcium flux  <cit> . this suggests that co-stimulatory pathways synergize with biochemical pathways induced via the tcr. whether cd <dig> ligation, in the absence of tcr signaling, leads to activation and differentiation has not been fully explored.

these findings show that effective t cell activation and differentiation towards effector subsets is the result of precise integration of multiple signaling routes. to explore the pathways underlying these distinct routes towards t cell activation and differentiation we used comprehensive biochemical characterization and gene expression profiling of jurkat t cells that were activated with various co-stimulatory signals in the presence of various inhibitors of specific signaling routes.

with this approach we identified specific pma/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> signal transduction and genomic fingerprints. pma/cd <dig> stimulation induced a th <dig> phenotype, dependent on both lck and pkcθ, whereas pma/cd <dig> stimulation, which is independent of tcr-mediated activation of lck, resulted in a profound activation of t cells, skewing towards a th <dig> phenotype.

RESULTS
activation of jurkat t cells by various stimuli leads to differential signaling fingerprints
jurkat t cells were activated by anti-cd <dig>  anti-cd <dig>  pma, or ionomycin or combinations of these single stimuli, in order to map the contribution of these stimuli towards the activation of proximal, medial and distal signal transduction pathways. as shown in figure 1a, cd3-stimulation and ionomycin/pma were able to increase intracellular levels of ca2+. interestingly, neither cd <dig> nor pma stimulation alone, affected intracellular ca2+ levels. as expected, cd3-signaling resulted in an lck-dependent phosphorylation of zap <dig> . stimuli containing pma directly activated the mapk pathway, which is reflected by the phosphorylation of erk, p <dig> and jnk . furthermore, pma addition directly activated pkc which was not reflected in the autophosphorylation of pkcθ, but was clearly detectable on the phosphorylation of the pkc substrate marcks . cd3-mediated stimulations and pma-induced stimulations resulted both in the activation of ap <dig> family transcription factors c-jun and atf <dig> . analysis of nuclear translocation of nfatc <dig> and c-jun /nfκb p <dig>  as part of the distal signaling events revealed that indeed cd3-mediated signaling induced both nfat and c-jun/nfκb, of which the latter pathways were potentiated by cd28-mediated signaling . in line with the calcium release from the er, pma or pma/cd28-mediated signaling did not induce nfat nuclear translocation but highly activated the cd <dig> responsive element transcription factors c-jun and nfκb p <dig> . these results indicate that two distinct co-stimulatory profiles can be identified. a cd3/ <dig> and pma/cd <dig> stimulus that signals via lck, increasing intracellular ca2+ and activating nfat, and a pma/cd <dig> calcium independent -stimulatory activation signaling via pkcθ and marcks. next, the molecular mechanisms involved in these signaling pathways were further explored in genomics studies.

differential regulation of genes after pma/cd <dig> and cd3/ <dig> vs pma/cd <dig> stimulation
in order to further characterize the different signal transduction events induced by different -stimulatory signals, we performed a first gene expression experiment with jurkat t cells that were stimulated for  <dig> or  <dig> hours with pma/cd <dig>  cd3/ <dig> and pma/cd <dig>  it appeared that after  <dig> hour a limited response on transcription level was seen, whereas after  <dig> hours of stimulation, several hundreds of genes were regulated. furthermore, pma/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> regulate more genes compared to cd3/ <dig>  reflecting the strength of the stimuli used . multivariate analysis by principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering showed that the  <dig> stimuli lead to clearly distinct gene expression profiles. at both time points the profile induced by pma/cd <dig> is clearly distinct from the profiles induced by pma/cd <dig> and cd3/ <dig> .

differentially regulated genes ccl <dig> and il- <dig> are profile-specific secreted proteins
gene profiles of the differential stimuli were ranked on the level of induction and evaluated on whether or not the translated protein is secreted. this resulted in the identification of the pma/cd28-specific transcript ccl <dig> , the cd3-specific transcripts il- <dig>  and xcl1/ <dig> . small but significant inductions of these genes were observed after  <dig> hour of stimulation for both ccl <dig> and il- <dig>  however, both genes were highly induced after  <dig> hours of stimulation. the secretion of the protein  <dig> hours after stimulation reveals an identical profile compared to the mrna .

pathway profiling with multiple stimuli and inhibitors
to investigate the contribution of proximal, medial and distal signaling events on the cd3/ <dig>  pma/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> stimuli, we performed a second gene expression profiling experiment with different selective inhibitors, including proximal kinase inhibitors lck , pkcθ , medial mapk inhibitors pd <dig> , sp <dig> , org 48762- <dig>  and the distal calcineurin  inhibitor cyclosporin a . jurkat t cells were stimulated with pma, cd <dig> and cd <dig> alone and combinations thereof in the presence of the above mentioned inhibitors. based on the results of the first gene expression profiling experiment, we chose evaluated gene expression after  <dig> hours of stimulation. a principal component analysis on the ratio data set is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  it appeared that the pma/cd <dig>  cd3/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> co-stimuli induced several hundreds of genes, whereas the effect of a single stimulus was smaller, with the exception of the pma single stimulus . the gene set induced by a pma stimulus showed a larger overlap with the genes induced by the pma/cd <dig> stimulus than with the cd3/pma induced gene set. whereas pma and cd <dig> as a single stimulus induce a large number of genes, cd <dig> elicits only a minor effect. it can be observed that csa, aeb <dig> and a <dig> induce the largest effects on gene regulation, whereas the inhibitors of the mapk pathway only have a minor effect on gene expression. this finding is corroborated by the number of regulated genes, showing that the mapk inhibitors only regulate a small number of genes whereas a <dig>  csa and aeb <dig> regulate many genes . a <dig> and csa only show a significant effect on the pma/cd <dig> and cd3/cd <dig> pathways, in which the effect of csa is smaller than the effect of a <dig>  aeb <dig> is the only compound that shows also a significant effect on the pma/cd <dig> induced pathway. these analyses were rerun with different settings for the thresholds used for gene selection. in all cases similar results were obtained indicating that the results were not critical dependent on the thresholds settings that were used.

inspection of the profiles of ccl <dig> and il- <dig> revealed that ccl <dig> mrna is highly induced via the pma/cd <dig> pathway. this induction is depending on pkc signaling and negatively regulated via lck signaling. apparently this effect was upstream of cn, since the inhibitor csa did not increase ccl <dig> mrna induction .

as expected, pma/cd <dig> and cd3/ <dig> stimuli and to a lesser extent pma/cd <dig> resulted in a marked expression of il- <dig>  which is highly depending on the lck/cn signal transduction pathway, and the pkc pathway. interestingly inhibition of mapk signaling  does not affect il- <dig> mrna induction . these effects on ccl <dig> and il- <dig> production by inhibitors of the lck/cn and pkc pathway were further substantiated in a full dose-response experiment. figure 5a shows that indeed aeb <dig> dose-dependently inhibited pma/cd28-induced ccl <dig> production, which is slightly enhanced in the presence of an lck inhibitor and which is not affected by cn inhibition via csa. il- <dig> production can be blocked by inhibition of both the lck/cn and pkc pathway . the involvement of lck in the cd3-mediated pathway and pkc in the cd <dig> and cd28-mediated pathways was further confirmed by the knock-down of both kinases under the distinct stimuli. knock-down of lck did not affect pma/cd28-induced ccl <dig> production, whereas knock-down of pkcθ resulted in significant inhibition of both il- <dig> and ccl <dig> . these results clearly show that pma/cd28-induced gene profiles are highly depending on pkcθ signaling pathways but are independent of lck/cn and mapk signaling pathways, whereas cd3-mediated signaling pathways are dependent on both lck/cn and pkcθ signal transduction and independent on mapk signaling events.

pma/cd <dig>  pma/cd <dig> and cd3/cd <dig> induce distinct genomic fingerprints
the above analysis indicated that treating jurkat t-cells with multiple combinations of stimuli and inhibitors highlights pathways that are regulated by specific combinations of stimulus and inhibitor, revealing the involvement of certain kinases as signaling hub under specific stimulatory conditions. in order to identify additional genes in the pathways that are exemplified by ccl <dig> and il- <dig>  we searched for genes with similar profiles to these pathway genes. figure  <dig> shows genes related to ccl <dig>  identified by a strong up regulation following pma/cd <dig> stimulation only and a down regulation by aeb <dig>  interestingly, besides ccl <dig>  which is a chemo attractant for th <dig> cells, many th2-associated genes co-clustered with ccl <dig>  including gata <dig>  itk, rxra, c-flip , icos and the il- <dig> receptor and also other genes that are associated with th <dig> development .

likewise a very specific il- <dig> profile can be constructed by selecting genes that are up regulated under all three conditions and down regulated by all three inhibitors, and by which csa is the weakest inhibitor . in this gene cluster appeared to be th1-associated genes, including the th <dig> master transcription factor tbet , th <dig> chemokine xcl1/ <dig>  ifnγ, granzyme, runx <dig>  fasl, ox40l , cd <dig>  and the il- <dig> receptor. of note, inhibition of both lck and cn under pma/cd <dig> stimulation enhanced the expression of th <dig> master transcription factors gata <dig> and rxra, but also peptidoglycan recognition protein  <dig>  and g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> .

a third example is provided by genes clustering together with egr <dig>  which show an up regulation by all stimuli but are specifically regulated by aeb <dig> in all conditions and only by a <dig> after cd3/cd <dig> stimulus. although il- <dig> and egr <dig> show a similar regulation by the stimuli used, the profiles can clearly be discriminated by the effects of the various inhibitors on their expression. the list of genes that are shown in figure  <dig> together with their annotation and the correlation score to the ccl, il- <dig> and egr <dig> profiles are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  additional file 2: table s <dig>  additional file 3: table s3

this analysis shows that by applying multiple stimuli and selective compound treatments, pathways can be unraveled at high resolution.

translation of pma/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> stimulations; differential modulation of primary t cell cytokine responses in human donor blood
in order to assess whether the stimulation profiles and signal transduction profiles identified in jurkat t-cells were also relevant in a primary human setting, the stimulation protocols were adapted and a primary assay was established using healthy human donor whole blood. the effect of differential stimulation was evaluated using ifnγ and il- <dig> as th1- and th17-associated read-outs respectively and both il- <dig> and il- <dig> as th2-associated read-outs. stimulation of human whole blood cells with cd3/cd <dig> was unsuccessful: no cytokine release was detected. however, pma/cd <dig> stimulation of human blood cells, resulted in a high production of ifnγ . interestingly, infγ production levels were significantly lower after pma/cd <dig> stimulation. a similar observation was seen when analyzing il- <dig> production. thus, higher production levels of both ifnγ and il- <dig> were seen following pma/cd <dig> stimulation when compared to pma/cd <dig> stimulation. furthermore, when analyzing th2-associated il- <dig> and il- <dig> production, we found that pma/cd <dig> stimulation was superior to pma/cd <dig> stimulation in enhancing production of these cytokines . of note, ccl <dig> production could not be detected in this assay system . in aggregate, the data suggests that pma/cd <dig> stimulation favours th <dig> responsiveness in this assay. since pma/cd <dig> signaling was shown to be independent of lck, but mainly dependent on pkcθ, whereas pma/cd <dig> signaling was both lck and pkcθ dependent we evaluated the effect of both proximal kinases in this human whole blood assay and evaluated ifnγ and il- <dig> production since these cytokines were most readily produced. figure 7c shows that indeed pma/cd3-induced ifnγ production is depending on both lck and pkcθ signaling, whereas pma/cd28-induced il- <dig> production is lck-independent and pkcθ dependent. these results clearly show that the differential stimulations identified in the jurkat assay can be translated towards a primary human cellular assay and are depending on the same proximal signaling hubs. furthermore, also in this setting it can be observed that pma/cd <dig> stimulation diverges more towards a th1-like phenotype, whereas pma/cd <dig> stimulation skews more towards a th2-like response.

pma/cd <dig> stimulation of purified human cd4+ t cells enhances th <dig> activation, whereas pma/cd <dig> potentiates th <dig> activation
using purified human cd4+ t cells we validated the effects observed on jurkat t cells and in a primary human whole blood assay setting. of all stimuli used pma/cd <dig> appeared to be the most powerful stimulus able to induce ifnγ production. also in this setting inhibition of either lck using a- <dig>  or pkc using aeb <dig> completely inhibited pma/cd <dig> induced ifnγ production. cd3/cd28-mediated stimulation, which can be successfully applied in this assay format induced ifnγ production, which was dependent on both lck and pkc mediated signal transduction pathways. of interest and comparable to the effects observed on ccl <dig> production by jurkat t cells, lck inhibition under pma/cd <dig> stimulation did not inhibit ifnγ production and even appears to slightly enhance ifnγ production . the observed effect on ifnγ production of the different stimuli is in line with the effects observed on the induction of the th <dig> master transcription factor tbet . both inhibition of lck and pkc reduced cd3/ <dig> and pma/cd <dig> mediated induction of tbet, whereas lck inhibition did not affect pma/cd28-induced expression of tbet.

pma/cd <dig> was the most profound inducer of il- <dig> in cd4+ cells . interestingly il- <dig> production under al stimulatory conditions used is dependent on pkc, whereas lck inhibition does not affect il- <dig> production under pma/cd <dig> or pma/cd <dig> culture conditions. under all culture conditions inhibition of pkc reduced il- <dig>  which was paralleled with reduced gata <dig> expression , whereas inhibition of lck appeared to promote th <dig> dvelopment under all stimuli used, which was reflected by enhanced expression of gata <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we systematically explored pathways involved in t cell activation by molecular profiling. we showed that tcr  driven stimulation profiles are truly distinct from co-stimulatory profiles mediated via pma/cd <dig>  secondly, using selective inhibitors and sirna we found that the proximal kinase lck is involved in cd <dig> and not pma/cd <dig> activation, whereas pkcθ appears to be a crucial central signaling kinase in both tcr and pma/cd <dig> -stimulatory activation of t cells. finally, stimulations involving tcr/cd <dig> appear to preferentially induce a th1-like fingerprint, whereas lack of tcr/cd <dig> signaling in the presence of pma/cd <dig> stimulation diverts t cells towards a th2-like state.

it has been suggested that the strength of tcr-signaling can regulate the fate determination of naive t cells; high-potency signals skew towards th <dig> differentiation, whereas low potency signals promote th <dig> differentiation  <cit> . although tcr and co-stimulatory pathways have been the focus of many studies in the previous decades, the direct contribution of tcr stimulation vs. co-stimulatory signals towards th differentiation is not fully understood. by stimulating t cells with pma/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> we dissected signaling pathways and explored the activation profiles. cd3-mediated signaling rapidly increased intracellular ca2+, a second messenger to activate many enzymes including calcineurin, which resulted in an increased nuclear translocation of nfatc <dig>  interestingly, pma/cd <dig> stimulation did not result in a ca2+-mediated response  but enhanced many of the co-stimulatory mediators including mapk/ap <dig> and nfκb signal transduction. these results are in line with earlier studies that showed differential effects of cyclosporine a  and dexamethasone on cd <dig> vs cd28-mediated signaling, which revealed that pma/cd <dig> stimulation was insensitive towards csa-mediated calcineurin inhibition in contrast to pma/cd <dig> stimulation  <cit> .

gene expression induced by combinations of stimulatory signals revealed pathway-specific biomarkers or fingerprints. pma/cd3-induced gene profiles included il- <dig>  ifnγ, xcl <dig>  granzyme b, and fasl, which have been associated with a th <dig> type of response  <cit> . also, sustained nfat signaling, which is also induced via pma/cd <dig> stimulation, has been shown to promote th1-like gene transcripts, including ifnγ, fasl and p-selectin glycoprotein ligand  <dig>  <cit> . our results are further substantiated by the finding that t-bet , the th <dig> master transcription factor  <cit> , and runx <dig>  which together with tbet are crucial for inducing ifnγ and repressing il- <dig>  <cit> , were highly expressed under pma/cd3-stimulatory conditions.

pma/cd <dig> stimulation does not induce a ca2+ flux nor does it increase nuclear translocation of nfat. however it provides the cell with a high level of co-stimulatory signaling, and induces a completely distinct genomic fingerprint compared to pma/cd <dig> stimulation. following pma/cd <dig> stimulation, jurkat t cells highly expressed ccl1/i <dig>  a chemokine which is highly expressed during a th2-eosinophil response in allergic airway diseases  <cit> . lymphotoxin , a cytokine which is associated with a th2-type of response controlling ige production  <cit> , was also highly expressed under pma/cd <dig> stimulation. in conjunction with this finding, the master transcription factors for th <dig>  gata <dig>  <cit>  and the retinoid x receptor   <cit> , were induced under the pma/cd <dig> stimulatory condition. notably, th2-associated cytokines like il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were not induced in jurkat t cells after pma/cd28-stimulation, this in contrast with pma/cd <dig> stimulation of human whole blood and purified cd4+ t cells, which could be due to the developmental blockage of jurkat t cells. additional file 6: figure  <dig> shows a schematic overview summarizing the involvement of the signaling pathways and genes induced under differential stimulation as observed in this study and highlights their relation towards t helper  <dig> and - <dig> development.

our results are in line with the notion that high calcium levels drive th <dig> and ctl responses and low calcium levels drive th <dig> responses  <cit> , which was further substantiated by our results using inhibitors for lck and cn, which modulate calcium signaling in t cells. these inhibitors repressed th1-associated genes under pma/cd3-stimulation, but induced th <dig> transcription factors gata <dig> and rxra, revealing a skewing of th <dig> towards th <dig> profiles. in contrast, pma/cd <dig> stimulation in the presence of lck and cn inhibition, th2-associated genes, e.g. ccl <dig> or il- <dig> in cd4+ t cells, were not affected or even induced. the crucial role of calcium and lck in driving th <dig> response is in line with the observation that knock down of lck affects the virus-specific th1/ctl response in mice and lck deficiency increases th <dig> associated cytokine production  <cit> . interestingly, lack of calcium signaling can give rise to an anergic t cell phenotype . therefore it would be of interest to further explore the role of lck in calcium-dependent activation via pma/cd <dig> on th1/ctl responses and calcium-independent activation of t cells via pma/cd <dig> on the induction of anergy in more detail.

cd <dig> signaling has been functionally linked with pkcθ induced activation of nfκb  <cit> , which was also validated using pma/cd <dig> as stimulus  <cit> . previously it has been reported that cd28-costimulation induces gata <dig> expression and th <dig> differentiation via the activation of nfκb  <cit> . additional studies in mice revealed that pkcθ is involved in mounting both th2- and th1-mediated lung inflammation, although th2-mediated inflammation is more pkcθ-dependent  <cit> . our studies show that inhibition of pkcθ can indeed inhibit a pma/cd <dig> stimulation, which was reflected by the effect of pkcθ inhibition on the pma/cd28-induced th2-like gene expression profile. these observations are in line with the results from cd <dig> knock-out mice and inhibition of cd <dig> signaling using ctla4ig, showing that the cd <dig> co-stimulatory signaling is crucial for mounting a proper th <dig> response. in contrast, th <dig> and ctl responses were found to be less dependent on cd <dig> signaling  <cit> . of interest, pkcθ inhibition in our hands, also affected pma/cd3-induced th1-like expression profiles. these results underline the duality of pkcθ in the integration of tcr and cd28-mediated signaling events which is evident from pkcθ ko mice experiments.

finally, our results also show that this differential stimulation does not only occur in jurkat t cells, but also plays a role in primary human t cells. these cells were found to secrete a th1-like response  via pma/cd <dig> stimulation, whereas pma/cd <dig> stimulation led to a th <dig> activation profile . in these cells inhibition of the lck/cn/nfat pathway was only effective after pma/cd <dig> stimulation whereas inhibition of pkcθ inhibited both pma/cd3-induced ifnγ production and pma/cd28-induced il- <dig> production. these results illustrate that the findings in the jurkat t cell line were successfully translated and relevant to a human primary cellular setting. interestingly, pma/cd <dig> stimulation also enhanced il- <dig> production in the primary human whole blood assay and increased the expression of the il- <dig> receptor, which is crucial for th <dig> induction  <cit> , in jurkat t cells. these results suggest that additional signals, like il- <dig> in conjunction with tgfβ and il- <dig>  might be necessary to differentiate from a th1-like phenotype towards a th <dig> phenotype, whereas the absence of tgfβ in the presence of high levels of il- <dig> will favor treg development or stabilization. therefore further exploration of these differential stimulations in the presence of defined/different cytokine stimuli could further elucidate t helper cell differentiation and establish sub-set specific genome profiles. the findings described in this paper offer a robust platform for in vitro activation of t cells, in which observed responses can be easily translated form jurkat t cells, towards purified cd4+ t cells and even human whole blood. this can be of interest for efficiency and selectivity profiling of kinase inhibitors or for pathway-specific biomarker identification for future drug development and clinical studies.
