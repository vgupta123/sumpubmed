BACKGROUND
lignin, the structural component of land plants, is a heteropolymer of coupled phenylpropanoid monomers derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohols; it is also the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose on earth. in gymnosperms, 30% of wood dry weight is lignin, in angiosperms this value is up to 25% . lignocellulosic polymers are the dominant carbon sink in forest ecosystems and account for approximately 20% of the terrestrial carbon storage  <cit> . in addition, the phenylpropanoid pathway synthesizes a plethora of specialized plant products  with protective functions . the biosynthesis of those phenylpropanoids involves intricate networks  <cit>  as shown by the kegg pathways http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map <dig> html.

the importance of specialized phenolic compounds for plant chemical defense has been the subject of intensive study in angiosperms , however, knowledge in gymnosperm lineages is sparse. in general, phenolics participate in pre-formed defenses  as well as in active defense reactions . biosynthesis occurs through a limited number of metabolic pathways , however, the extreme structural diversity of compounds found so far  is due to biosynthetic enzymes that belong to multi-member gene families. phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and its genetic basis has been recently reviewed  <cit> . for poplar, gene families involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis exhibit an expansion and diversification in comparison to short-lived annuals  <cit> , suggesting diversification of chemical defense strategies. the limited number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes functionally characterized in gymnosperm species include those involved in angiosperm lignin biosynthesis .

constitutively present phenolics have high priority as defenses against bark-boring insects in long-lived conifers, but pre-formed defenses are regarded costly for the plant since "assimilates" are diverted. this impacts growth rate and reproduction  <cit> . our previous findings  already reflected the biochemical link between growth and established  defenses in this important metabolic pathway.

conifers have extremely large genomes , which largely consist of repetitive elements , but the enormous size of conifer genomes is also likely due to complex gene families that have been significantly enlarged from angiosperm ancestors. these families have structural and regulatory functions related to defense/resistance mechanisms against pests and pathogens . those multigenic families resulted from duplications of genes that further diverged.

in the plant kingdom, angiosperms are well studied compared to ancient lineages such as mosses, ferns, or gymnosperms  <cit> . therefore, we must rely upon known and characterized candidates from angiosperms to gain insight into the evolution of sequence orthologs of conifer phenylpropanoid-like genes. this involves evidence for neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or neo-subfunctionalization within gene families. gene duplication is recognized as an important mechanism for adaptive evolution in plants  <cit> . duplication allows "neofunctionalization" or the retention of ancestral function by one gene and the origin of new functions by the second gene. likely, the novel gene function adopted by one copy of the duplicated genes, which now determines their functional differences, is co-opted from a secondary ancestral property already present before the duplication event  <cit> . the fate of specialized terpene synthases in spruce is one well-studied example that exemplifies how neo-functionalizations account for functional plasticity in a multi-gene family  <cit> .

another mechanism for maintenance of gene duplicates involves gene conservation using gene-dosage effects and functional redundancy  <cit> . moreover, loss of genes and regulation of gene activity through transcript accumulation are other important aspects to consider in gene evolution. phylogenetic trees are robust for prediction of orthologous genes in the presence of gene losses and varying rates of evolution among the sampled taxa  <cit> . hence, in our study of multi-gene families in spruce we employed phylogenetic reconstruction to facilitate gene annotations.

in the present work, we determined the extent of gene co-expression by correlation analysis for  <dig> est microarray elements . the analysis included a number of multi-gene families originating from  <dig> biosynthetic genes, three structural genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, transcription factors nac and myb , and sams  .

the same ests were studied by means of "genetical genomics" to investigate the genetics of defense mechanisms of white spruce against the white pine weevil . genetical genomics  <cit>  combines gene expression with genotyping to map quantitative trait loci  for gene expression. this new approach to the study of quantitative genetics allows rapid and direct discovery of genes underlying a trait of interest  or genes closely regulated with the qtl by "genetic co-localization" . for example, due to the genetic as well as environmental and developmental sources of variation, transcript level variation at a gene locus underlying a qtl is highly associated with the total phenotypic variation in the actual quantitative trait  <cit> . hence, in systems where the environment shows a strong effect on the phenotype, this approach has advantages over conventional qtl analysis with low resolution that further necessitates positional gene cloning  <cit> .

RESULTS
genetical genomics reveals candidate genes for weevil resistance and genomic regions with regulatory hotspots
in the present study we merged genetics and transcriptomics  <cit>  to better understand weevil resistance in spruce, an important phenotypic trait that defines the life history of this economically valuable perennial plant organism. gene expression variation represents the phenotype most directly related to dna sequence polymorphism, such that in principle each transcript has a corresponding gene with known position in the genome  <cit> . genetical genomics allows assaying thousands of these gene expression traits simultaneously and thus provides data on a large and unbiased set of traits ; these 'expression phenotypes' are then accessible to standard qtl analysis. using the gene expression traits obtained from our transcriptome study we achieved fine scale phenotyping that was merged with phenotyping of the conventional traits. this allowed us to identify positional candidate genes for any phenotypic variation by testing for co-segregation of markers with gene expression, individual resistance traits, or the composite trait represented by all sampled defense traits . this way, we found certain members of complex gene families within the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway individually associated with weevil resistance.

we used the experimental setup as presented in figure  <dig>  plant material was harvested - as outlined in the methods section - from the progeny of resistant-female-by-susceptible-male crosses, which showed wide segregation for weevil resistance and had shared parentage . thus, cross  <dig> of ♀pg87*♂pg <dig>  cross  <dig> of ♀pg87*♂pg <dig>  cross  <dig> of ♀pg21*♂pg <dig> and cross  <dig> of ♀pg21*♂pg <dig> forming the partial diallel were chosen for further analysis. the plant material used for expression profiling  was harvested in a randomized fashion to minimize bias due to the sampling procedure. dna from an expanded mapping population  was genotyped using a custom-built  <dig> multiplexed snp chip. this information was used to estimate pairwise recombination rates between snp loci and subsequently construct the framework genetic linkage map for localizing the qtls . phenotypic information for qtl analysis was obtained from  tree height,  weevil attack,  oviposition, and  transcriptomics data. measures were taken for the initial tree height in  <dig>  and heights in years three and five as well as leader length in year five preceding the artificial augmentation of the local weevil population in october of the same year. attack rates in  <dig> and  <dig> were classified as successful top kills, failure to kill the leader, and no attack. for the same years, egg counts along the leaders were summarized into five discrete classes. comprehensive information about these measures can be found in additional file  <dig>  in the transcriptomics experiment a two color  <dig>  k spruce est array was employed for gene expression profiling in the partial diallel progeny. a distant pair design that maximized direct comparisons between different alleles at each locus  <cit>  was modified for outbred individuals . signal intensities can be found under the geo accession number gse <dig>  we used the signal intensity at each est spot for the following analyses:  generation of expression qtls  and  establishing a co-expression network. in the latter the gene-gene interactions were assessed. specifically, a gaussian model and a shrinkage method were employed to evaluate direct gene connections . qtls were mapped in the diallel progeny using a likelihood function to assess the phenotype effect conditional on genotypic variation. a qtl was significant at lod≥ <dig>  . a goodness-of-fit test assuming a uniform distribution was performed to test whether the observed frequencies of eqtls along the linkage map differed significantly from the expected value. following the rejection of this null hypothesis "eqtl hotspots" signified eqtl clusters with ≥ <dig> eqtls at a given locus. positional candidate genes were identified by collocation of at least 40% of their eqtls with phenotypic trait qtls based on the criteria for identifying significant qtls . the positional candidate genes for the general 'resistance' trait were identified based on strong collocations of gene expression variation with all six studied resistance traits .

expression variation from  <dig> gene spots generated  <dig>  significant eqtls . figure 1a shows the phenylpropanoid pathway, gene families from the core branch as well as related families; data relevant for this study are found in additional file  <dig>  phenylpropanoid pathway-linked genes that showed strong association with the general 'resistance' phenotype were: sams, one adt-like gene , an annotated spruce cyp <dig> , and a member with similarity to lar. an additional  <dig> phenylpropanoid-related candidate genes were identified based on significant co-segregation with individual weevil resistance traits such as attack rates and oviposition estimates: transcription factors , putative members of the upstream shikimate pathway , one putative pal, two annotated chs as well as one sts, two omts from group c and one from group d , two p450s , three different representatives of phenylpropanoid reductases , one dir , six prxr , two putative lacs, one putative catechol-o-methyltransferase and two genes with similarity to lar. most associations were found for weevil susceptibility measured in the year  <dig> and for both years  <dig> and  <dig>  no dedicated monolignol biosynthetic gene co-segregated extensively with any resistance trait. however,  <dig> genes from our gene set were associated with individual height growth traits , additional file  <dig>  as many as  <dig> peroxidases co-segregated with growth traits, among them several genes which are implied in lignin polymerization by radical coupling of the monolignols. their co-expression pattern with other phenylpropanoid-related genes is shown in figure  <dig> 

we superimposed at a given snp marker pqtl maps of individual phenotypic traits and counts of significant eqtls from the studied gene set . we found regulatory hotspots comprising multiple pqtls and accumulated eqtls. along this qtl density map, eight loci represented hubs of trans-eqtls, which also corresponded with at least three pqtls: four loci were associated exclusively with resistance qtls, and each two loci with growth qtls and qtls from individual traits of both growth and resistance, respectively . the composition of those eqtl hotspots with extensive pqtl overlap is given in additional file  <dig> 

since the phenylpropanoid pathway proved to be important in insect resistance, we looked at the representation of individual branches within the pathway as well as individual gene families among those regulatory hotspots that were associated with pqtls. we have summarized the average number of detected eqtls per gene family as well as gene families whose members have eqtls at a minimum of two regulatory hotspots with pqtl association . specifically, we compared members from transcription factors myb and nac, the shikimate pathway, pal, c4h and 4cl , and gene families that are involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary compounds as well as lignin and lignans, respectively . among all pathway branches, the branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway that is directly involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary compounds generated on average the highest number of eqtls, whereas the shikimate pathway generated the lowest number of eqtls on average. also, the transcription factors followed by the pathway branch that is directly related to lignin/lignan biosynthesis contributed on average the most members to resistance associated hotspots . in  <dig> out of  <dig> studied gene families, individual family members contributed eqtls to at least two different phenotype-associated eqtl hotspots. for example, members of ccoaomt, ccr, adt, as well as myb, prxr, omt, p <dig> families had eqtls preferentially associated with resistance hotspots . specifically, we found adts , omts from group c as well as both aeomt genes, the lignin-forming genes piglccoaomt <dig>  picabprx <dig> and picabprx <dig> orthologs and the stress inducible picabpiprx gene, and the p450s that are involved in a wide range of derivatization reactions , additional file  <dig>  the dir gene family members had eqtls predominantly associated with growth trait qtls  that were mainly representatives of the f-family .

although most spruce gene markers used to build our framework linkage map lack consistent annotations , additional file  <dig>  for the few loci that are potential gene expression regulators located within eqtl hotspots and affect highly complex phenotypes, we further infer their putative gene function in spruce. for example, the growth trait associated locus on lg <dig> with accumulated eqtls from  <dig> array elements  represents a glutamate decarboxylase  gene. gad catalyzes gamma-aminobutyric acid  synthesis via decarboxylation from the amino acid glutamate. the regulation of gad enzyme activity is vital for normal plant development, and is accomplished by calcium/calmodulin binding to the specific cam domain of gad allowing the plant to respond to various external stimuli  <cit> . recently, the locally enhanced production of gaba in the plant was shown to be connected with a deterrence reaction of the host responding to herbivore attack  <cit> . two loci that encode bona fide ccoaomt genes  on lg <dig> represented eqtl hotspots that overlapped with qtl regions for various resistance traits . at the two different ccoaomt loci a common set of pqtls  as well as eqtls  clustered. most prominently the following gene families were involved: prxr , dir , omt , myb  and adt , additional file  <dig>  both ccoaomt genes have also cis-eqtls  that likely represent promoter polymorphisms involved in the differential expression of the genes. our finding of cis-eqtls connected by extensive trans-regulatory interactions describes an example of epistasis that is commonly observed in the regulation of pathway biosynthetic genes  <cit> .

arogenate dehydratase and related sequences
while arogenate dehydratase activity was first detected in nicotiana sylvestris  <cit> , gene cloning and functional characterization was only recently reported in petunia hybrida  <cit> . five putative white spruce arogenate dehydratases  were identified with similarity to characterized bacterial and fungal prephenate dehydratase . they group together with a. thaliana and p. hybrida  implied in the catalysis of the last step of the shikimate pathway specific for the biosynthesis of phenylalanine  . in addition, eight adt-like white spruce genes fall into two more remote clusters of the small family .

four adt genes as well as six adt-like genes were represented as elements on our microarray. the adt-like gene picgladtl <dig> was identified as positional candidate for the general resistance phenotype per se, additional file  <dig>  in the co-expression network three adts  as well as one adt-like  were present . despite the central importance of adt in generating the precursor molecule phenylalanine, adts were positioned at the edges of long-range subgraphs in gene-gene interactions, figure  <dig> , . picgladt <dig> was significantly co-expressed with a class ii 4cl gene ws01010_m <dig> , see below , supporting its function as adt. expression of picgladt <dig> is negatively correlated with the cluster of constitutive dirigents of the f and b/d class , figure  <dig> . the adt-like picgladtl <dig> was co-expressed with opcl picglacl <dig>  suggesting both genes act in a related pathway.

4-coumarate:coa-ligase  and related acyl coa ligases 
in the biosynthesis of lignin, soluble and wall bound phenolics and flavonids, 4-coumarate:coa ligase  plays a gate keeper role as the enzyme generates not only the coa ester of coumaric acid in the last step of the core phenylpropanoid pathway , but the higher substituted coumarate derivatives, such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 5-hydroxyferulic acid, and sinapic acid in some angiosperms as well. 4cl is part of a family of adenylate-forming enzymes present in all organisms, including an arabidopsis gene recently shown to encode a functional 3-oxo-2-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid  coa ligase  catalyzing an essential step in jasmonic acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the 4cl gene family is moderately sized  <cit>  and shows four bona fide 4cl genes for spruce . three white spruce 4cl candidates clustered closely with arabidopsis 4cl <dig>  and one spruce gene was found orthologous to loblolly pine 4cl <dig>    <cit> . in the context of adenylate-forming acyl-coa ligases,  <dig> white spruce candidates fell into four divergent clusters, out of which four closely grouped with the arabidopsis opcl, indicating a similar function . while this represents a large subfamily, our knowledge about the function of the members is limited.

of  <dig> array elements with similarity to acyl-coa ligase genes, three represent sequence orthologs of bona fide 4cl genes, while ten elements have higher similarity to oxo-pentenyl-cyclopentane , additional file  <dig> and figure  <dig>  two spruce 4cl genes  were present in our co-expression network, figure  <dig>  they represent spruce classii 4cl genes, which are involved in the formation of flavonoids and soluble phenolics. picgl4cl <dig>  was directly co-expressed with two positional candidates for resistance traits , figure  <dig> . picsi4cl <dig>  is co-expressed with picgladt <dig>  figure  <dig> . the absence of the classi representative picgl4cl <dig>  and other lignin forming genes  along with the presence of other gene family members such as those involved in defense mechanisms like dirigents , p450s, polyketide synthases and phenylpropanoid reductases  suggests higher importance of the recovered gene-gene interactions for defense mechanisms than for normal plant development.

ccoaomt superfamily, related to caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase
caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase  catalyses o-methylation of the hydroxyl group at the c <dig> position of the phenolic ring in conversion of caffeoyl-coa to feruloyl-coa  and has been characterized in many plants, including loblolly pine, where it is associated with developmental lignification  <cit> . three white spruce genes are closely related with a loblolly pine ccoaomt in the clade of bona fide ccoaomt . the diversity observed in the white spruce ccoaomt clade is the result of lineage-specific gene duplications that were retained throughout evolution.

all three genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis were absent from the co-expression network. however, picglomt <dig>  the spruce specific remote omt   that is putatively involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and a positional candidate for ht_ <dig> growth trait , was represented by two array spots  in the network. these two genes termed ccoaomt_ <dig> and ccoaomt_ <dig> were directly connected to transcription factors  as well as to a putative shikimate epsps synthase ws0085_b <dig>  figure  <dig> . furthermore, two catechol-o-methyltransferase-like genes ws0107_o <dig> and ws01013_k <dig>  resided at the edges of the network : the first clustered with various annotated genes , while the second, a positional candidate for the egg_ <dig> resistance trait, connected to genes with unknown functions. the phylogeny for said catechol-o-methyltransferase  sequences suggests they are ubiquitous genes that lack a counterpart in modern/angiosperm plants  and are part of a yet to be elucidated pathway in conifer defenses.

polyketide synthases related to chalcone and stilbene synthases 
stilbene synthase  and chalcone synthase  are plant-specific polyketide synthases at the entry of stilbenoid and flavonoid biosyntheses, respectively . both types of enzymes perform a sequential condensation of three acetate units to a coa-ester to form an intermediate that is folded into the aromatic ring systems of naringenin chalcone or the stilbene backbone  <cit> . while flavonoids, which play a vital role as uv protective pigments in plants, are ubiquitous in the land plant kingdom and were reported in the basal lineages of liverworts and mosses  <cit> , stilbenes have so far been detected in relatively few plant families where they contribute to the resistance of woody tissues to degradation and act as phytoalexins. the main constitutive stilbene glycosides in picea species are astringin and isorhapontin  <cit> . fourteen spruce chs-like sequences form a tight cluster with the japanese red pine chs, indicating several duplications of functionally related polyketide synthases . while the ancestor of modern polyketide synthases predates the evolution of gymnosperms and angiosperms, the close relationship of sts and chs within the angiosperms and gymnosperms indicates that these functions evolved independently several times. in gymnosperms distinct clades of both pine and spruce orthologues are found for sts and for chs, consistent with the presence of both functions in a common ancestor of these lineages.

strong collocation of gene expression and trait variation identified two chs genes picsi-pks <dig> and picsi-pks <dig> as well as the sts gene picgl-pks <dig> as potential candidates for weevil resistance traits , additional file  <dig>  picsi-pks <dig> ws0014_m <dig> is present within the network  and co-expressed with picgl4cl <dig> and a peroxidase ws0063_p <dig> that co-segregated with the sum_atk resistance trait ). picgl-pks <dig> ws00925_g <dig>  ) was negatively co-expressed with peroxidase picsiprx <dig> ws0074_a <dig> that responded to wounding . the chs gene ws0024_k <dig>  from the picsi-pks <dig> cluster is associated with a myb transcription factor ).

picgl-pks <dig> ws00731_e <dig>  was negatively co-expressed with a-family dirigent pgedir <dig> ws00911_i <dig> , chs_ <dig> and dir_10). the expression of pgedir <dig> was significantly triggered by insect feeding  <cit> , see below. interestingly, picgl-pks <dig> was co-expressed with an anac <dig> transcription factor ws00929_e <dig> ) that accumulated with increasing growth rate . the contrasting expression pattern found for diverse members of the polyketide synthase gene family reflects the differential gene regulation for individual members.

o-methyltransferase superfamily, related to caffeic acid/coniferaldehyde o-methyltransferase 
a total  <dig> of omt/comtl candidates were identified in white spruce through mining of the treenomix est database , relative to  <dig> genes in arabidopsis, eight in poplar, and six in rice . the founding members of the o-methyl transferase superfamily  involved in the synthesis of methylated plant phenolics are related to the formation of the angiosperm monolignol precursor of s-lignin. however, the s-lignin pathway and sinapic acid-derived metabolites, such as syringyl lignins, are absent in gymnosperms . even though they are broadly represented in the omt/comtl superfamily, evidence for dedicated bona fide comt orthologues in white spruce is missing.

omts were among phenylpropanoid gene families most completely represented in the co-expression network . three comtls  similar to the stress inducible o-methyltransferase from scots pine  were highly co-expressed, omt_ <dig>  omt_ <dig>  omt_ <dig>  omt_ <dig>  figure  <dig> . their expression was negatively correlated with the expression of a sequence  that shares similarity to atper16/atper <dig> and is a positional candidate for the hgt <dig> trait . five spruce omts  that are part of the lineage specific clade in the plant omt/comtl superfamily  cluster within the network ) and were co-expressed with a transcription factor that weakly resembles the secondary wall-associated atmyb <dig> . picglomt- <dig> ws0099_a <dig>  with strong similarity to a beta-alanine betaine synthase , represents a positional candidate for the egg_ <dig> trait and is co-expressed with pgedir <dig>  a dirigent of the a-subfamily, dir_ <dig>  figure  <dig> . although their classification here is based on phylogenetic analysis alone, and biochemical characterization needs to support the annotation, spruce genes of the omt/comtl superfamily possibly extent the repertoire of spruce defense mechanisms.

cytochrome p450s involved in oxygenation of phenylpropanoids
in addition to a major plant carbon sink - the lignin biosynthesis - cytochromes p <dig> contribute to the biosynthesis of many bioactive phenolic derivatives . in the families of the cinnamte hydroxylase  and coumaroyl-shikimate 3'-hydroxylase  two and one white spruce candidate were identified, corresponding to single genes in arabidopsis, while no white spruce coniferylaldehyde 5-hydroxylase  sequence orthologues were found. in the cyp <dig> family, seven diverse white spruce candidates form two distinct clusters with the arabidopsis cyp75b <dig> encoding a functional f3'h  <cit> . phylogenetically related, but without biochemical function assigned,  <dig> white spruce candidates constitute the unusual large and diverse conifer specific cyp <dig> family, an outgroup to angiosperm cyp <dig>  another group of p450-dependent monooxygenases forms the spruce-specific outgroup of nine cyp76-likes .

within cyp75/f3'h sequences, family member c <dig> represents a positional candidate for the sum_egg resistance trait. another representative  is present in our co-expression network ) and is negatively correlated with nac_ <dig> , a nac transcription factor that is a candidate for the atk_ <dig> resistance trait. the function of the diverse cyp <dig> family  is unknown, however, the sequence relationship with cyp <dig> , cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> , and cyp <dig>  which are involved in oxidation reactions of the phenylpropanoid metabolism indicates that these families and cyp750s may share a common progenitor and possibly a structurally similar substrate of the phenylpropanoid class. on our array  <dig> spruce specific cyp <dig> genes were represented , one cyp <dig>  was identified in our study as a positional candidate for the weevil resistance phenotype per se, and three cyp750s  are found in the co-expression network. c <dig>  was co-expressed with a candidate  for the general resistance phenotype ). c <dig>  was negatively correlated with myb myb_ <dig>  that is loosely related to tt <dig>  a putative regulator of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis  <cit> , and in our study a positional candidate for both atk_ <dig> and sum_atk resistance traits ). expression patterns for both cyp750s suggest diverged, though unknown, functions consistent with their position in different subclades . the third cyp <dig> c <dig>  was negatively correlated to a cluster of co-expressed peroxidase genes of which some are implied in monolignol polymerization , spruce arathper <dig> ws0031_g <dig> , and arathper <dig> ws01016_d <dig>  orthologues, see elsewhere) ). future characterization of spruce cyp <dig> candidates will need to uncover their enzymatic function in planta.

phenylpropanoid reductases
phenylpropanoid reductases are a class of closely related enzymes that include leucoanthocyanidin and isoflavone reductases , pinoresinol and lariciresinol reductasess , phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase , and isoeugenol synthase  that have been shown to participate in the biosynthesis of a plethora of constitutive and induced defense related phenylpropanoids and phytoalexins, such as lignans and isoflavans  <cit> . with the exception of the ifr family, for which no white spruce homologues were identified, at least two white spruce candidates were detected in the other families . a total of  <dig> white spruce homologs cluster closely with the loblolly pine pbr <dig>  which reduces the benzylic ether functionalities of both dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol and dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol in the formation of 8-5'-linked lignans  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic distance of the white spruce candidates to the functionally characterized angiosperm and gymnosperm phenylpropanoid reductases does not allow functional predictions extending beyond similarity of the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction.

out of  <dig> array elements annotated as phenylpropanoid reductases  <dig> were present within the co-expression network . gene expression variation of picglppr <dig> ): pcber_ <dig>  pcber_ <dig>  pcber_16) was co-expressed with the secondary wall-associated atmyb <dig> , which was a candidate for the ldr <dig> growth trait. picglppr <dig> is a positional candidate for the sum_egg resistance trait; its transcript abundance was lowest in the spruce mapping family with the most vigorous growth and highest weevil attack rate . in the network this pcber gene  was connected to picgldir <dig> , a member of the b/d-subfamily and the cluster of peroxidases involving monolignol forming enzymes ), figure  <dig> . transcripts of picglppr <dig>  accumulated with increasing growth rate, and picglppr <dig>  was negatively co-expressed with the resistance phenotype candidate lar ws00725_b <dig>  dfr_ <dig>  figure  <dig> . the latter is correlated with another  lar representative ws00926_b <dig>  that was lowest expressed in the spruce mapping family  <dig>  the stress inducible picabprx <dig> ws00928_g <dig> , and the cluster of dirigents involved in constitutive defenses, dir_ <dig>  dir_ <dig>  dir_ <dig>  dir_ <dig>  dir_ <dig>  figure  <dig> , see also below. the expression pattern for picglppr <dig> suggests that this pcber could be involved either in susceptibility or tolerance to insect feeding. however, for other representatives  their co-expression pattern suggests involvement in constitutive defenses.

dirigent proteins
a recent study on sitka spruce dirigent-like proteins   <cit>  reported  <dig> unique dir or dir-like genes. for our survey, we were able to use expression data from  <dig> elements annotated as unique dirs and represented on the microarray covering distinct a-, b/d-, and f-subfamilies . the dir f-subfamily is spruce specific, while angiosperm members can be found for both a- and b/d- subfamilies,  <cit>  showed that dirs from different clades have distinct gene expression patterns with a suggested role in induced defense to weevil feeding for members of the a- subfamily. representatives of b/d- and f-subfamilies are more likely involved in primary processes or constitutive defense .

within the network picgldir <dig> ws00815_a <dig>  was co-expressed with a growth trait associated transcription factor resembling secondary wall-associated atmyb <dig>  and with a cluster of six putative laccases, figure  <dig> . a cluster of constitutive dirigents involving b/d-subfamily members ), and picsidir <dig> ws0058_h <dig> from f-subfamily were co-expressed with remote lar , one of the identified positional candidates for weevil resistance, figure  <dig> .

pgedir <dig>  was highly up-regulated in bark tissue following weevil feeding and for pgedir <dig> , another a-subfamily member, the highest induction was registered,  <cit> . in the network, pgedir <dig>  was co-expressed with two other a-subfamily members , dir_ <dig>  dir_ <dig>  figure  <dig> , and for pgedir <dig> gene expression was negatively regulated with the expression of the polyketide synthase picgl-pks <dig>  chs_ <dig>  figure  <dig> . thus, our experiment confirms previous observations that dirigent subfamilies in constitutive defenses are differentially regulated than dirigents in induced defenses. similar to the cluster of spruce/conifer-specific members from the omt superfamily , see above, dirigents from the same subfamily are also strongly co-expressed. this provides evidence for the presence of a multitude of gene copies with the same or highly similar protein functions that act in related pathways.

class iii peroxidases
plant class iii peroxidases represent a key multifunctional enzyme family that is involved in such diverse processes as auxin catabolism, defenses, general stress responses, and lignification  <cit> . peroxidases were suggested to function in the radical reaction of monolignols to the polymer lignin  <cit> . misregulation of peroxidases provided indications for altered lignin composition . recently, two lignin-forming peroxidases have been identified and characterized from norway spruce suspension culture showing substrate preference for h- or g-lignin precursor molecules, respectively  <cit> . to date,  <dig> peroxidase unigenes for conifer lignin polymerization have been identified and their expression abundance in different tissues and after biotic and abiotic challenges studied  <cit> .

for eight genes  the respective white spruce orthologues were represented on the microarray . while some peroxidases with proposed roles in lignin polymerization are related to developmental lignification , others were stress inducible  and reflect the specific stress responses of peroxidases . in addition, gene expression of two other inducible peroxidases  were surveyed . picsiprx <dig>  was co-expressed with several other peroxidases, figure  <dig> . constitutive expression levels of picsiprx <dig>  increased with higher inherent growth rate of individuals . picsiprx <dig> expression  was negatively correlated with expression of stilbene synthase picgl-pks <dig> , a positional candidate for the egg_ <dig> resistance trait ). we suggest that picsiprx <dig> and picgl-pks <dig> are involved in different defense strategies. the white spruce picabprx <dig> orthologue ws00928_g <dig> is significantly associated with the sum_egg resistance trait, and is also co-expressed with the remote leucoanthocyanin reductase, one positional candidate for the "resistance phenotype" per se, , additional file 1).

the ability to bind lignin was demonstrated in vitro for picabprx <dig>  <cit> . the white spruce orthologue of picabprx <dig> is a positional candidate for hgt <dig> growth trait. picabprx16/ <dig> is a positional candidate for hgt <dig> trait. a co-expression cluster involving the white spruce orthologue of popalprx ws0099_b <dig>  a putative spruce homologue of the secondary wall-associated transcription factor atmyb <dig> ws0051_i <dig> and s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  ws0261_c <dig> were positional candidates for hgt_ <dig> trait ), additional file  <dig>  also, the picabprx <dig> orthologue ws00912_j <dig>  was co-expressed with a cluster of peroxidases with growth associations , additional file 1), among them picabprx6/picabprx <dig> . interestingly, transcript abundance for all genes in this cluster decreased with growth rate. this suggests that a number of peroxidases are important in reinforcement of anatomical structures . similarly, lignin biosynthetic genes are down-regulated in fast growing individuals  <cit> .

the stem-borer pissodes strobi damages the host tree by attacking the shoot apical leader of the previous year's growth. the feeding larvae typically consume phloem tissue. in the spruce bark, the secondary phloem and the cambium are very active chemical defense production zones that include secondary metabolites such as the polyphenolics that are abundantly present in the parenchyma. pre-formed defenses are established co-ordinatedly during the development of secondary xylem in the apical shoot  <cit> .

we studied the complexity of phenylpropanoid-related gene families and gene regulation of individual family members. we found evidence for new pathways in conifer defenses that involve genes without counterparts in modern plants that need to be further investigated. employing genetical genomics, we showed that this approach is valuable for elucidating interactions between genes that originate from complex families with multiple related sequences. by including weevil resistance and height growth traits in the quantitative analysis, we identified eight genomic regions with extensive accumulation of phenotypic variation from multiple traits coinciding with hotspots of transcript abundance variation. the identified master regulons ranked hierarchically highest among all genotyped loci, since they are likely responsible for massive gene expression variation in the pathway and were linked to changes in the studied phenotypes.

phenylpropanoid and related gene families in spruce
phenylpropanoids fulfill important functions as defense compounds, e.g. simple hydroxycinnamic acids and monolignols or the structurally complex flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and stilbenes. they have overlapping roles as signaling molecules in plant development and plant defense  <cit> . the conifer phenylpropanoid pathway is characterized by a higher level of complexity compared to angiosperms  that might include several not yet resolved alternative pathways. the expansion of phenylpropanoid and related genes into multi-gene families serves either the independent regulation of the biosynthesis of different classes of compounds or the gene dosage through massive accumulation of these compounds  <cit> . for example, we identified several associations with weevil resistance traits for individual members of the nadph reductase gene family with a range of product specificity of related phenylpropanoid-derived plant defense compounds . we also identified associations for members within two spruce-  specific groups massively represented in the omt superfamily  and the phenylpropanoid p450s , respectively, both with entirely unknown functions .

generally, plant specialized metabolism is characterized by gene duplication events and gene diversifications leading to modified/optimized product specificity and modified tissue specific expression  <cit> . however, it is currently unclear whether adaptive or non-adaptive forces are more important for the maintenance of gene duplicates  <cit> . in brief, new pathways were established among different plant species by independent recruitment and inactivation of biosynthetic enzymes through downregulation or loss of certain genes of an ancestral pathway  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that ccoaomt-suppression in pine, unlike in angiosperms, generates only moderate reduction in lignin due to compensatory reactions that lead to the incorporation of unusual monolignols   <cit> . in the o-methyltransferase family  we also found one gene with high similarity to functionally characterized catechol-omt conserved across species of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms, but was lacking in the angiosperms .

in total,  <dig> positional candidate genes were directly associated with resistance traits . positional candidate genes were prominently identified in expanded gene families such as dirigents and peroxidases, for which some members are implicated in downstream reactions of lignan/lignin formation. plant class iii peroxidases are a key multifunctional enzyme family that is involved in diverse developmental and defense processes . evidence that certain peroxidases may function in lignin polymerization came from gene misexpression experiments that altered lignin composition  <cit> . in several gene families of the core lignin pathway, members exist that can function in both stress/elicitor response and developmental lignification  <cit> . however, given the individual families sizes, phenylpropanoid reductase, cyp <dig>  chs/sts, and omt gene families showed the highest proportion of positional candidate genes for resistance. spruce genes with sequence similarities to comt  and f5h , two enzymes involved in the syringyl  lignin formation in angiosperms, were identified. due to the lack of these pathways in gymnosperms and to their low sequence similarity, these sequences were annotated as omts putatively involved in stilbenoid synthesis and p450s putatively acting in flavonoid synthesis, respectively . it is likely that enzymatic reactions in monolignol/lignin biosynthesis are adopted from conserved ancestral pathways that originally functioned in protection against microbial infection or uv radiation. interestingly, those reactions emerged in different plant lineages by convergent evolution  <cit> .

gene expression regulation of gene family members in the phenylpropanoid pathway
microarray experiments that aim to elucidate gene expression differences between treatment and control groups usually involve reference or related designs in a small sample set and cross-hybridizations between gene spots with high nucleotide similarity complicate data interpretation. however, the specific statistical procedure employed in genetical genomics that studies large experimental populations of randomized genetic background reduces this effect. positions of eqtls locate genomic regions that harbor regulatory elements that control the expression of a single gene or a subset of genes acting in the same pathway. in the case of cis-regulation, the genomic location of the eqtl coincides with the physical location of the regulated gene, while trans-acting eqtls identify regulatory elements for the gene elsewhere in the genome. distribution of eqtls may spread evenly on the genome or appear in clusters or in "hotspots" depending on the genetic architecture of gene interactions. in this way, master regulons involved in multiple traits  can be identified, and the amount of epistasis from interacting loci can be uncovered  <cit> . we used this approach to identify spruce genes that are potentially important for constitutive defense mechanisms and to establish resistance against pissodes strobi.

apical leaders of  <dig> picea glauca individuals were studied for gene expression changes in phenylpropanoid genes prioritized from our  <dig>  k spruce est chip . genomic regions with clustered expression and phenotypic trait variation might contain master regulons . regions underlying trans-eqtl hotspots have pleiotropic genetic background . loci that accumulate pqtls of both growth and resistance traits may be involved in fitness trade-offs. we identified two such eqtl hotspots on the spruce genome . the thorough functional analysis of such largely pleiotropic genes is hampered because their knock-out mutants likely exhibit lethal or highly deleterious phenotypes  <cit> . however, recently, a locus was characterized which conveys plant resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogens and herbivores and at the same time reduces vegetative growth  <cit> . the dirigents represent a candidate gene family for which some members were associated with both growth and resistance trait variation, e.g., expression variation for picsidir <dig>  as well as picsidir <dig>  mapped onto eqtl hotspots associated with growth traits and resistance traits .

phylogeny and the analysis of the underlying gene expression pattern identified functional divergence among members of gene superfamilies. in several cases gene expression of family members was co-regulated with variation in weevil resistance. eqtls that accumulated at resistance hotspots were generated from diverged gene family members of ccoaomt , omt , prxr , cyp <dig> , dir , the pcber , and 4cl  . it has recently been shown that tandem gene duplication and subsequent gene retention is particularly common for biotic stress genes  <cit> . this finding indicates that the increased rate of gene duplication and diversification offers the potential for adaptive evolution and divergence. thus, the neo-and subfunctionalizations found in the multi-gene families of the spruce phenylpropanoid pathway are possibly highly important for beneficial phenotypic innovations.

linkage groups on our spruce qtl map were assigned following  <cit>  and the spruce-loblolly pine comparative mapping project . therefore, valuable cross-species comparisons for qtl positions are available for pinaceae, e.g., the two bona fide ccoaomt genes ccoaomt- <dig> and ccoaomt- <dig> mapped to the spruce lg <dig> , in synteny with the recently published loblolly pine  <cit> .

not only did the two bona fide ccoaomt genes harbor eqtl hotspots but also overlapped with qtl regions for the traits atk_ <dig>  egg_ <dig>  and sum_egg . this suggests a close association of monolignol formation with defense against the stem borer pissodes strobi. it is known that cell wall-integral lignin provides a physical barrier for invading pests. specifically, the lignified parenchyma cells are the important pre-formed anatomical structures that are involved in such constitutive defenses  <cit> . in addition, localized de novo synthesis of lignin with structural similarity to early developmental lignins occurs in response to stress and is associated with wound healing . at the two ccoaomt loci, eqtls were mostly generated from genes of the shikimate pathway, monolignol biosynthesis and downstream condensation reactions, lignan formation, flavonoid biosynthesis, and multifunctional omt activity. the genomic region harboring the cluster of ccoaomt genes flags its general importance. we found in our large-scale transcriptomics study that 36% and 53% of the mapped trans-eqtls generated from  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, were commonly shared between both ccoaomt loci. certain gene ontology categories were overrepresented and commonly shared between the two eqtl cluster . this suggests interactions between both ccoaomt loci and other genes that extend beyond the phenylpropanoid metabolism. further investigations will substantiate this in detail.

in contrast to ccoaomt- <dig> and ccoaomt- <dig>  association with extensive phenotypic variation is currently unknown for ccoaomt- <dig>  yet, the three ccoaomt genes represent our most comprehensive example of differential gene regulation for duplicated genes . no trans-eqtl from ccoaomt- <dig> mapped onto ccoaomt- <dig> and vice versa; however, the third ccoaomt gene exhibited trans-eqtls at both loci, suggesting a lower regulatory hierarchy for ccoaomt- <dig> among all three genes . ccoaomt- <dig> expression variation also mapped onto the growth trait associated eqtl hotspot on lg <dig>  and, generally, the transcript abundance of ccoaomt- <dig> was increased with higher inherent growth rate in the experimental population . ccoaomt- <dig> is a positional candidate for hgt <dig> trait. at locus ccoaomt- <dig> eqtls from erfs linked to defensive gene expression ) accumulated . consequently, ccoaomt- <dig> could indeed function in constitutive resistance. the identified regulators  were shown to affect important constitutively expressed defense genes such as basic chitinase and glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> protein . the three monolignol biosynthesis genes were likely retained throughout evolution because of their individual importance and their temporally and spatially dependent recruitment for lignin formation: lignin that is constitutively expressed and related to primary processes, lignin that is wound inducible and participates in active defense, or lignin that is deposited for wound healing.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the genetics of pest resistance and utilizes genetical genomics to elucidate the genetic basis and evolution of phenolics based insect resistance in a commercially valuable conifer tree species. the results add to recent qtl studies that have dissected mechanisms underlying the genetic control of wood traits and volume growth in eucalyptus but were completely lacking testing of biotic stress resistance, and in particular, for conifers  <cit> . we utilized eqtl mapping to conduct a pre-selection of the candidate genes by testing for correlations with resistance traits. the findings can facilitate research efforts on targeted gene association studies specific to nonstructured conifer populations aimed at resolving the genetic basis of host resistance to herbivory.

our work also provides a substantial account and perspective of the functional characterization of several unresolved alternative pathways in plant defenses. the subfunctionalization of individual gene family members of the phenylpropanoid pathway was evident at the phylogenetic and at the gene expression level. using genetical genomics, we confirmed that some candidate genes in this pathway were indeed genetically associated with qtls for white pine weevil resistance. weevil resistance was also associated with trans-regulatory hotspots. at such genomic regions, eqtls were generated by several subfamilies from multimember families like 4cl, ccoaomt, omt, cyp <dig>  ppr, dir, and prxr. tandem gene duplication and subsequent gene retention is common for biotic stress genes  <cit> . phenylpropanoid metabolism has been identified as a source of tandemly repeated orthologous groups  <cit> . based on their tight genetic linkage  <cit> , bona fide ccoaomt genes in conifers might be tandemly repeated in the genome. in this study we found that all three genes present in the spruce genome are functionally diverged. thus, in multi-gene families of the phenylpropanoid/lignin pathway individual members can be recruited for plant development and pest resistance, respectively. neo- and subfunctionalizations in such gene families can be important resources for genetic variation in the perennial. recently, it was shown that members of the small pal gene family in the herbaceous annual arabidopsis can have both distinct and overlapping functions in processes related to growth, development, and responses to environmental stresses  <cit> . our results add to the existing literature on the role of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the evolution of conifer defense mechanism against insect pests. our findings highlight that specific genes within the phenylpropanoid pathway can be duplicated and diversified in long-lived conifers in a process that is fundamentally different from shorter lived angiosperm species.
