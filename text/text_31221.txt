BACKGROUND
p62dok/dok <dig>  which was identified by carpino et al. and yamanashi and baltimore in  <dig>  was the first identified member of the downstream of tyrosine kinase/docking protein  family. since then, six other members have been identified: p56dok/dok2/dokr, dok3/dokl, dok <dig>  dok <dig>  dok6/dok <dig> like and dok <dig>  <cit> . dok family proteins are adaptor proteins that act as substrates of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . all seven family members share a similar structural topology: an n-terminal pleckstrin homology  domain, a central phosphotyrosine-binding  domain, and a c-terminal region  <cit> .

interestingly, although all the members share almost same structural feature, they exert different, even opposite, roles in different tissues and organs. dok <dig> to dok <dig>  which are predominantly expressed in haematopoietic tissues, act as negative regulators  <cit> . the results from single or double knockout of dok1/dok <dig> mice provided solid evidence to indicate their negative roles in leukemogenesis  <cit> . yasuda et al. also showed that dok <dig> and dok <dig> are negative regulators of the t cell receptor signal pathway  <cit> . dok <dig> exerts its negative role in the immunoreceptors of b cells and the macrophage signalling pathway by formation of dok3-ship <dig> complex  <cit> .

the other four family members, dok <dig> to dok <dig>  are expressed in non-haematopoietic tissues, functioning in different places and in different ways. dok <dig> is widely expressed, especially in intestine, kidney and lung that are all epithelial in origin. bedirian et al. showed that dok <dig> may function as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase signal pathway  <cit> , while grimm et al. found that dok <dig> and dok <dig> enhanced c-ret-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  and promoted neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . also, uchida et al. showed that dok <dig> may promote glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor -mediated neurite outgrowth in tgw cells through activation of the rap1-erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> .

dok <dig> is mainly expressed in nervous system. it acts as a substrate for the insulin receptor  and gdnf receptor c-ret, and can promote gdnf-induced neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . for dok <dig>  in situ hybridisation results indicated that it is also specifically expressed in the nervous system, especially in the cortex and dorsal root ganglia . crowder et al. showed that dok <dig> could promote ret-mediated neurite outgrowth in n2a-α <dig> cells  <cit> . dok <dig> was identified recently and plays an important role in neuromuscular synaptogenesis by interaction with muscle specific kinase . mice lacking dok <dig> fail to form acetylcholine receptor clusters and neuromuscular synapses  <cit> . patients who have mutations in dok <dig> develop congenital myasthenic syndrome  associated with small neuromuscular synapses  <cit> .

our previous work has shown that dok <dig> is a substrate of tropomyosin-related kinase b and trkc receptors and is involved in neurotrophin-induced mapk activation  <cit> . neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , neurotrophin  <dig>  and neurotrophin 4/ <dig> , and so on, are a family of growth factors implicated in several different functions in the nervous system  <cit> . there are two types of receptors for neurotrophins: the trk family are high affinity receptors, while p <dig> is a low affinity receptor. the trk family receptors have three members, trka, trkb and trkc, that are structurally conserved and exhibit specificity to different neurotrophins. trka is the preferred receptor for ngf, trkb prefers bdnf, while nt- <dig> is the preferred ligand of trkc  <cit> . neurotrophins stimulation can induce the dimerisation and phosphorylation of trk receptors, which then recruit and phosphorylate downstream adaptor proteins to mediate signal transduction  <cit> . it has been reported that neurotrophins and trk receptors are involved in almost all stages of nervous system development, such as survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, axon and dendrite projection, and neuron patterning  <cit> .

to date, dok6's functions in the nervous system have been poorly understood. in this study, we identified dok <dig> as a novel substrate of the trkc receptor. we confirmed that dok <dig> selectively binds to the npqy motif of trkc through its ptb domain in a kinase activity-dependent manner. immunostaining results showed that trkc and dok <dig> colocalise in e <dig>  mouse cortical neurons. knockdown of dok <dig> decreased neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons upon nt- <dig> stimulation, which indicates that dok <dig> is involved in nt-3-mediated neuronal development.

RESULTS
dok <dig> binds to the trkc intracellular domain  but not trka or trkb through the ptb domain in a yeast two-hybrid system
our previous work indicated that dok <dig>  a member of the p62dok family, directly interacted with trkb and trkc receptors to act as a downstream substrate to induce mapk activation  <cit> . we used dnaman software  to analyse the homology of dok family proteins and found that dok <dig> and dok <dig> are the most conserved among all seven family members , which means dok <dig> may be more like dok <dig> than any other members in the family. in consideration of the same specific neural expression pattern of trk receptors and dok <dig> in embryonic mice  <cit> , we hypothesised that dok <dig> may bind to trk receptors directly to act as a downstream substrate, as dok <dig> does, and play a role in the embryonic development. to verify this, we first used a yeast two-hybrid system to test whether there were interactions between dok <dig> and trk receptors. interestingly, the results showed that dok <dig> only binds to the trkc icd, but not to trka or trkb, different to results with dok <dig> . the results implied more specificity of dok <dig> to trk receptors compared with dok <dig>  we then inserted the dok <dig> ph domain, ptb domain and c-terminal region into the pact <dig> vector and tested for these by yeast two-hybrid assay to determine the interaction region for dok <dig>  as shown in figure 1d, like dok <dig>  the ptb domain of dok <dig> is the key domain responsible for interaction; neither the ph domain nor the c-terminal region is involved in the interaction.

dok <dig> binds to trkc receptor in glutathione s-transferase  precipitation and coimmunoprecipitation  assays
to confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we performed a gst precipitation assay. as shown in figure 2a, upon neurotrophin stimulation, trk receptors became highly phosphorylated compared to those without stimulation, as shown by blotting with anti-p-trk antibody . consistent with results from the yeast two-hybrid assay findings, the precipitation results proved that the dok <dig> ptb domain binds to the activated trkc receptor strongly in vitro, while no remarkable binding was found between dok <dig> and trka or trkb with activation or no activation . next, by co-ip experiment, we further investigated the interaction between dok <dig> and activated trkc receptor . the consistent results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, gst precipitation assay and co-ip experiment implied that dok <dig> selectively binds to trkc receptor, but not trka or trkb.

dok <dig> binds to the npqy motif of trkc receptor in a kinase activity-dependent manner and could be phosphorylated upon nt- <dig> stimulation
as shown in figure 3a, there are five tyrosine residues  in the trkc receptor icd that could be phosphorylated upon treatment of nt-3; each tyrosine residue mutation would disrupt interaction between the receptor and corresponding substrates  <cit> . among them, tyr <dig> is located in the conserved npqy motif, which is the typical binding motif of the ptb domain  <cit> . as known from previous work, the ptb domain recognises the npqy motif in two different manners: dependent or independent on phosphorylation. our previous work demonstrated that dok <dig> binds to trkb and trkc directly at this site depending on the phosphorylation state. therefore, we hypothesised that this tyrosine residue was also important for the interaction with dok <dig>  another residue, lys <dig>  is essential for tyrosine kinase activity of trkc. mutation of this site would produce a kinase-inactive trkc receptor that could be used to test whether this interaction is dependent on kinase activity or not. to this end, we constructed serial mutant trkc receptors  for yeast two-hybrid assay and gst precipitation experiments to determine the binding site on the trkc receptor for dok <dig> and to ascertain whether this binding depends on phosporylation or not.

as expected, the yeast two-hybrid results showed that trkc y516f  lost most interaction with dok <dig>  while the other four tyrosine mutant receptors  did not dramatically affect binding. the kinase-inactive receptor trkc k572a  had no interaction with dok <dig> either, which implied that the npqy motif and the kinase activity of trkc receptor are both essential for this interaction .

using gst precipitation experiments, we further confirmed that dok <dig> binds to the npqy motif of the trkc receptor depending on phosphorylation. wild-type trkc receptor could be precipitated by dok <dig> upon nt- <dig> stimulation, while neither the mutant receptor trkc k572a  nor trkc y516f  could interact with dok <dig> . consistent with yeast two-hybrid data, the unrelated tyrosine mutant trkc y820f  showed similar result as the wild-type trkc receptor. moreover, as a substrate of trkc, the phosphorylation level of dok <dig> was greatly enhanced upon treatment with nt- <dig> . in summary, the ptb domain of dok <dig> binds to tyr <dig> in the conserved npqy motif of the trkc receptor in a kinase activity-dependent manner.

dok <dig> colocalises with trkc and binds to trkc receptor in e <dig>  mouse brains
as we had confirmed that dok <dig> could interact with the trkc receptor in vitro, next we investigated if dok <dig> could bind to the trkc receptor in vivo. to test trkc and dok <dig> commercial antibodies, we overexpressed v5-tagged trkc and flag-tagged dok <dig> in human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells, and tested hek <dig> cell lysates and e <dig>  mouse brain lysates via western blot. as shown in figure 4a, trkc and dok <dig> that was either endogenously expressed in e <dig>  mouse brains or overexpressed in hek <dig> cells  were both recognised by these antibodies; the anti-v <dig> and anti-flag antibodies were used as positive control . additionally, to verify the specificity of the trkc antibody, we overexpressed v5-tagged trka, trkb and trkc in hek <dig> cells, and cell lysates were blotted with anti-v <dig> or anti-trkc antibodies. the results showed that our anti-trkc antibody only recognised the trkc receptor, but not the trka or trkb receptors .

as has been shown previously the expression levels of trkc and dok <dig> in embryonic mouse cortex are remarkable  <cit> , so we hypothesised that dok <dig> may work as a substrate of the trkc receptor and play a role in embryonic mouse cortex development. immunostaining showed that trkc and dok <dig> colocalise at the membrane, cytoplasm and neurites in primary cultured cortex neurons . we then collected homogenates of e <dig>  mouse brains to perform immunoprecipitation tests with anti-dok <dig>  using igg as a negative control. the results showed that the trkc receptor was immunoprecipitated by anti-dok <dig> antibody remarkably well, but not by igg . also, consistent with results achieved by in vitro experiments, both trkc and dok <dig> are phosphorylated . taken together, these results provided evidence that dok <dig> works as a substrate of the trkc receptor in vivo and may have important roles in cortical neurons.

dok <dig> plays a role in neurite outgrowth in e <dig>  mouse primary cortex neurons
to study the exact roles of dok <dig> in the cortex, we constructed knockdown clones of dok <dig>  and nonsense controls . first, we tested the inhibition effect of our knockdown constructs by using western blotting. as shown in figure 5a, dok6i decreased the expression level of dok <dig> almost threefold in hek <dig> cells compared to the nonsense control construct.

crewder et al. showed that dok <dig> could promote neurite outgrowth in n2a cells  <cit> , so we hypothesised whether dok <dig> was also involved in neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons; this was tested for by knockdown of the expression of dok <dig>  we transfected primary cultured cortex cells  with dok6i and nonsense control. as the rnai vector had a green fluorescent protein  expression cassette within it, the cells with green fluorescence were therefore transfected cells; microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  was used as a marker for neurons. then,  <dig> h later, the lengths of neurites in cells with both red and green fluorescence  were measured. the results showed that knockdown of dok <dig> caused an almost 25% decrease in neurite outgrowth in primary cortex neurons compared to nonsense control , which indicated that dok <dig> plays a role in neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons.

dok <dig> is involved in cortex neuron neurite outgrowth through the nt-3/trkc pathway
as we have shown that dok <dig> works as a substrate of the trkc receptor in mouse brain, next we investigated whether dok <dig> exerted its role in cortex neuron neurite outgrowth through the nt-3/trkc pathway. first, we performed co-ip experiments to test for interactions between trkc and dok <dig> in cortex neurons that were treated with or without nt- <dig>  consistent with previous results, dok <dig> binds to the trkc receptor in cortex neurons upon nt- <dig> stimulation, while without nt- <dig> stimulation no obvious interactions exist . next, we transfected cortex cells with dok6i and the nonsense control construct. then,  <dig> h later, these cells were treated with or without  <dig> ng/ml nt- <dig>  the neurite lengths of transfected cells were measured as described above . the results showed that the average neurite length for positive neurons increased almost six fold after stimulation with nt- <dig> in the nonsense control group. however, in the dok <dig> knockdown group, the increase was only about  <dig> -fold . this result suggests that nt- <dig> promotes neurite outgrowth in the cortical neuron, and knockdown of dok <dig> partially blocks the nt- <dig> promotion effect in neurite outgrowth, which implies that dok <dig> is exerting its role in cortex neuron neurite outgrowth through the nt-3/trkc pathway.

discussion
in the present work we used yeast two-hybrid assays, gst precipitation assays and co-ip experiments to demonstrate that dok <dig> interacts with trkc, which is a member of trk receptors family. we also ascertained that dok <dig> binds to the npqy motif in the icd of trkc through its ptb domain, and this interaction depends on trkc receptor kinase activity induced by nt- <dig>  our previous study showed that dok <dig> could interact with trkb and trkc, but not with trka  <cit> . although the homology between the dok <dig> and dok <dig> ptb domains is as high as  <dig> %, there are still some different amino acids, which may result in the different protein structures. this may be why dok <dig> and dok <dig> exhibit different binding specificities to trk receptor members. additionally, the structural differences in trk receptor members may be the reason why dok <dig> only binds to trkc, and not to trka or trkb. trk receptors play pivotal roles in almost all aspects of nervous system development, and knockout results for each member or its ligand indicate that tkra, trkb and trkc play different roles in these events  <cit> . dok <dig> selectively binding to the trkc receptor may suggest its physiological function in the nt-3/trkc pathway, while dok <dig> may be involved in both the bdnf/trkb and nt-3/trkc pathways simultaneously.

it has been reported that many adaptor proteins may bind to the npqy motif in trk receptor icds through the ptb domain, such as shc, insulin receptor substrate  and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate  <dig>   <cit> . trk receptors recruit these adaptor proteins to perform their pivotal roles. for example, upon stimulation with ngf, trka recruits shc and phospholipase c -γ <dig> to promote neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . considering the complexity of the signal transduction network, it is hard to draw a picture of how these proteins could work together properly. in general, each single receptor could bind to several adaptor proteins; meanwhile, each adaptor protein could also interact with different kinds of receptor. therefore, it is possible that, by using different receptor-adaptor combinations, cells can finely tune their signal transduction networks to fulfil different tasks. also, we must consider the distinct expression patterns  of these receptors and adaptor proteins to study their exact roles in vivo. as reported by crowder et al., dok <dig> is mainly expressed in the embryonic brain and adult central nervous system, especially in the cortex and drg  <cit> . this suggests that dok <dig> may have a role in brain development. additionally, the nt-3/trkc pathway is believed to regulate neural precursor cell differentiation during cortical development  <cit> . the overlapping expression patterns of trkc and dok <dig> in the cortex imply their functional relevance on a physiological level. furthermore, in this study our immunoprecipitation experiment and colocalisation test results confirmed that dok <dig> interacts with trkc in mouse cortex; this provided more evidence of dok6's real function in vivo.

we also demonstrated that dok <dig> is involved in nt-3-mediated neurite outgrowth of mouse cortex neurons, which indicates that dok <dig> plays important roles in cortical development. these results enriched the signal transduction networks of the nt-3/trkc pathway in the cortex. however, the downstream targets and signal pathway of dok <dig> are poorly understood  <cit> , and identification of these downstream targets is necessary for further studies. like dok <dig> to dok <dig>  several tyrosine residues localise in the c-termini of dok <dig>  which may serve as binding sites for downstream targets and hence may be critical for downstream signal transduction. however, although dok <dig> and dok <dig> share high homology with dok1-dok <dig>  they fail to interact with adaptors such as ras gtpase activating protein , nck, and src homology  <dig> domain-containing inositol phosphatase , and so on, and bioinformatics studies have not clarified why this is the case  <cit> . it may be that immunoprecipitation, coupled with mass spectrometry identification assays, would be a good choice to elucidate the downstream targets. however, genetic study of dok <dig> knockout mice may provide the strongest evidence for its physiological function in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified dok <dig> as a new substrate of the trkc receptor and dok <dig> selectively binds to the npqy motif of trkc through its ptb domain in a kinase activity-dependent manner. we have also shown that dok <dig>  as a substrate of trkc, plays an important role in nt-3-mediated neurite outgrowth in mouse cortex neurons. these results give new clues as to dok6's function in vivo, and enriched the nt-3/trkc pathway networks in cortical development. it also shed light on the treatment of nervous system deficiency diseases.
