BACKGROUND
the mediterranean fruit fly , ceratitis capitata , is one of the most devastating and economically important insect pests  <cit> . an effective biological and environment-friendly control of this pest is the sterile insect technique   <cit> . the sit reduces a pest population by mass release of reproductively sterile male insects into a wildtype  population of the same species. this leads to the decrease of progeny by competition of sterilized males with wt males for wt females  <cit> . thus, the sterilization of the pest species in sit programs is of major importance and is commonly induced by radiation. however, the sterility and competitiveness are indirectly correlated  <cit> . in some programs therefore lower doses of radiation are used to generate lines which are more competitive even though only partially sterile. in preventional release programs, completely sterile flies are released into pest-free areas to avoid the establishment of invasive fruit flies and to control the constant problem of re-infestation  <cit> . these programs have to use 100% sterile flies to avoid a novel introduction of insect pests. however, the competitiveness of such flies is reduced due to the high dose of radiation required for complete lethality, which results in the expensive need of high numbers of males per field-release and a high frequency of such releases.

a first approach to cause reproductive sterility by transgene-based embryonic lethality without the need of radiation has been successfully shown in the non-pest insect drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . the system is based on the transmission of a transgene combination that causes embryo-specific lethality in the progeny. to limit the effect of the transgenes to the embryonic stage, promoter/enhancers  from cellularization-specifically-expressed genes drive the expression of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator . the expressed heterologous transactivator then activates the expression of the lethal effector gene hidala <dig>  <cit>  and leads to complete embryonic lethality in d. melanogaster. to generate suppressible, dominant lethality in medfly and at the same time restrict the effects of lethality to embryos, a direct transfer of the sterility system from d. melanogaster  <cit>  to medfly was previously tried. the genomic integration of the driver construct carrying the sry α p/e from d. melanogaster into medfly was successful, but none of the transgene insertions expressed the system activator tta at a detectible level  <cit> . we therefore concluded that the cellularization-specific p/e from d. melanogaster is not functional in medfly and that endogenous p/es have to be used to generate such a system.

here, we report the development of the first transgenic embryonic lethality system for medfly using an early embryonic lethal transgene combination. when transgenic males carrying this system are mated to wt females, all progeny die during embryogenesis without the need of radiation. due to the complete lethality in embryonic stages no fruit damage from developing larvae would occur from progeny of wt females mated to transgenic males and no transgenes would ingress into the wild population. moreover, males carrying this system are highly competitive in laboratory and field cage tests. after successful evaluation, a combination of this new embryonic lethal medfly system with a sexing system will become a powerful tool to improve sit programs.

RESULTS
isolation of cellularization-specifically-expressed genes and their p/es from medfly
the isolation of the medfly homologs of the cellularization genes sry α and nullo by degenerate primer pcr using an embryonic cdna pool was not successful  <cit> . thus, we carried out pcr-based cdna subtractions of different embryonic stages and identified several cellularization-specifically-expressed genes . the genes c.c.-slow as molasses , c.c.-sub2_ <dig> , c.c.-cg <dig> , c.c.-serendipity α , c.c.-sub2_ <dig> , and c.c.-sub2_ <dig>  are expressed specifically during medfly blastoderm cellularization . none of the genes shows maternal expression or expression at later stages, except c.c.-sub2_ <dig>  which is additionally expressed during germ band elongation .

germline transformation with driver and effector constructs
by inverse pcr, we isolated the p/es from c.c.-slam, c.c.-sub2_ <dig>  c.c.-cg <dig>  c.c.-sry α, and c.c.-sub2_ <dig> containing about  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb of the complete 5'utr and upstream sequences. the isolated p/es were fused to the tetracycline-controlled transactivator gene tta and used to engineer different driver constructs  embedded into piggybac vectors carrying polyubiquitin -driven dsred as a germline transformation marker  <cit> . additionally, three effector constructs were generated  carrying the lethal factor hidala <dig> under control of either p element  <cit>  or hsp <dig> basal promoters  <cit>  from d. melanogaster. in the >trep-hidala5> construct the lethality inducing transgene is flanked by gypsy insulator elements , which should reduce position effect-caused variable expression  <cit> . except for sl1-tta, all constructs carry a minimal attachment p  site  <cit> , which potentially enables site-specific phic31-integrase-mediated integration to modify transgenes at successfully evaluated genomic positions  <cit> .

five driver constructs  and the three effector constructs were used for germline transformation of medfly. for each construct we obtained transgenes of which we further analyzed a maximum of three independent lines .

early expression of tta incites hidala5-mediated lethality
we crossed  <dig> independent homozygous driver lines with five independent homozygous effector lines to generate  <dig> different combinations . from each combination, we collected eggs to visualize the early expressed tta and proapoptotic gene hidala <dig> by in situ hybridizations. the lethal activity of each combination was checked by a second egg collection, which was counted for eggs and progeny. to describe the dimension of lethality we henceforth use the term 'complete lethality' for 100% lethality in laboratory experiments. the lethality was checked in this trans-heterozygous condition, since the heterozygous condition must suffice to induce lethality when homozygous males are crossed with wt flies in intended applications. all combinations that showed detectably lower or no progeny under these trans-heterozygous conditions were then inbred to generate homozygous  lethality lines . in addition four combinations with non-reduced progeny were made homozygous for comparison .

all lls expressed tta specifically during cellularization. however, due to the different p/es as well as integration sites, the tta expression strength varied and resulted in different expression strengths of hidala <dig> . this resulted in variable efficiencies of the lethality system. lls deriving from the same driver line showed similar expression levels of tta. the p/es sl <dig>  and  <dig>  mediated only very weak expression of tta, which subsequently could not induce detectable levels of hidala <dig> expression. the longer p/e region of sl <dig>  was able to drive tta and, indirectly, hidala <dig> , but the level of hidala <dig> expression was not high enough to drive complete lethality . with the p/e cg <dig> we obtained a strong level of tta expression during cellularization , which started the expression of hidala <dig> during the cellularization stage  and led to complete pupal lethality of ll # <dig> .

besides the finding that different p/es or p/e regions act differently on tta and the dependent hidala <dig> expression, also the integration site of the driver construct could influence the tta expression . three independent lines, carrying the driver construct with the sry α p/e at different integration sites, expressed the tta specifically but with different strengths during cellularization . in ll # <dig>  a weak expression of tta led to a late expression of hidala <dig> during germ band retraction, which was not able to drive complete lethality . in contrast, the lls # <dig> and # <dig> expressed tta strongly during cellularization , which activated hidala <dig> expression at the cellularization stage  and led to complete l <dig> larval lethality for ll # <dig> and complete embryonic lethality for ll # <dig> . thus, a strong tta expression seems to be important to start the hidala <dig> expression early enough to cause complete embryonic lethality.

in addition, the effector constructs with different basal d. melanogaster promoters or different integrations of the same effector construct influence the levels of hidala <dig> expression and lethality. the effector constructs trep-hidala <dig> and >trep-hidala5>, carrying the p-basal promoter, were able to express hidala <dig> in medfly after activation through the  <dig> independent driver lines, but did not cause complete lethality in  <dig> different combinations . interestingly, the effector construct trehs43-hidala <dig>  which carries the basal promoter  of d. melanogaster hsp <dig>  showed differences in the expression strength of hidala <dig> depending on the integration site of the construct. in comparison with the larval or embryonic lls # <dig> or # <dig>  which are derived from the effector line trehs43-hidala5_f1m <dig>  the hidala <dig> expression in lls # <dig> and # <dig> deriving from trehs43-hidala5_f1m <dig> started at later stages  and was not sufficient to drive complete lethality at the embryonic, larval, or pupal stage. thus, we can show that the choice of e/ps as well as the integration site of both the driver and the effector is crucial to set up a successful embryonic lethality system.

molecular and cytogenetic characterization of transgenic lines
transgenic driver and effector lines were preliminarily screened for homozygous condition by fluorescence patterns and intensity. southern blots indicated single copy integrations of driver and effector constructs of the lines sryα 2-tta_f4m <dig>  sryα 2-tta_m2m <dig>  trehs43-hidala5_f1m <dig>  and trehs43-hidala5_f1m <dig> . moreover, the correct piggybac-mediated integrations at canonical ttaa target sites were verified by isolation of 5' and 3' insertion site sequences by inverse pcr . therefore we know that differences in expression strength and functionality of the lethality system in different lls are not a result of multiple insertions of the driver or effector constructs, but must be due to position effects. furthermore, the integration sites of the driver and effector construct for lls # <dig> and # <dig> were mapped by chromosome spreads. we found the driver and the effector of ll # <dig> or ll # <dig> located on chromosome  <dig> at the positions 74b and 70b or 63b and 70b, respectively . thus, both lls # <dig> and # <dig> have been results of recombinations. ll # <dig> was more difficult to establish than ll # <dig>  corresponding to an expected lower recombination frequency between loci 74b and 70b than between loci 63b and 70b .

maternal suppressibility of lethality and its reversibility
females feeding on adult food containing a suppressor, tetracycline  or doxycycline , should be able to transfer the suppressor molecules maternally into the oocytes. after egg laying, this maternally contributed suppressor should bind to the tta protein produced during early embryogenesis, blocking the trans-activating potential of tta and thus the switch of the lethality system. to identify the minimal concentrations of tc needed to rear the lls # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig>  flies were bred on larval and adult media containing different concentrations of tc. we defined the optimal tc concentration in adult and larval medium for rearing as the lowest possible amount of tc combined with the highest possible number of descendants. the lls # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> could be reared efficiently on adult medium containing  <dig> μg/ml tc and ll # <dig> even on  <dig> μg/ml tc. all lls could be reared on larval medium containing  <dig> μg/ml tc, except ll # <dig> . lls # <dig> and # <dig> were in addition tested to be efficiently rearable on larval medium containing only  <dig>  μg/ml tc or dox. when reared on larval medium lacking tc, all lines showed a reduction of progeny. rearing lls # <dig> and # <dig> on adult food containing  <dig> μg/ml dox resulted in maternal suppression of the lethality, even without tc or dox in the larval food. hatching and pupation rates were comparable to wt flies reared on adult and larval food without dox. thus, dox is able to maternally suppress the embryonic lethality. however, eclosion rates were still reduced when dox was used in adult food only .

in addition all lines and wt showed delayed ovary development and 5– <dig> day postponed egg laying when reared on adult medium containing  <dig> μg/ml tc and larval medium containing  <dig> μg/ml tc. this indicates the importance of reducing the tc concentrations to a minimum for the efficient rearing of medfly lines.

to test for reversible sterility of lines # <dig> and # <dig>  adults were reared on tc-containing medium  for two days . after transfer to tc-free medium the rate of progeny decreased in five days to 0%. the sterility could be reversed by retransfer of the adults to tc-containing medium. the reduced rate of progeny after this procedure could be due to a slight irreversible effect of the lethal system or to the advanced age of flies, as shown in other studies  <cit> .

efficiency and competition tests
during medfly sit programs, irradiation sterilized males are released into affected areas and mate with wt females, which leads to infertile matings. ideally all progeny die as embryos to exclude damage to fruits from larval feeding. to show the efficacy and time point of lethality for the newly generated lls, transgenic males  from lls # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  or wt were crossed with wt females, respectively . for the lls # <dig> and # <dig>  about 20% of the eggs survived to become l <dig> larvae, whereas pupae and adult progeny were highly reduced. crossings with males from lls # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> showed complete pupal lethality but varying larval and embryonic lethality. only  <dig> % of the laid eggs from the ll #66-crossing hatched and all of those died during l <dig> larval stage. the ll #67-crossing showed the desired complete embryonic lethality.

an ideal line for releasing purposes should be embryonic lethal, but should also be competitive. we therefore did competition tests with lls # <dig> and # <dig> . wt females were crossed with wt males and transgenic males in different ratios . the reduction of progeny compared with wt-only controls showed that both lines are highly competitive. remarkable is the higher fertilization success of ll # <dig> males compared with wt males starting from ratio 1:1: <dig>  for the ratio 1:1: <dig> an overall progeny rate of only  <dig> % was measured. at the same time a wt control at ratio 1:10: <dig> gave only little reduction of overall progeny . thus, transgenic males from lls # <dig> and # <dig> performed in laboratory competition tests comparably or even better than wt males. progeny from all competition tests were identified as non-transgenic individuals by fluorescent microscopy, which additionally indicated the complete lethality of lls # <dig> and # <dig>  interestingly, all lines deriving from the effector line trehs43-hidala5_f1m <dig>  partially lacked anterior orbital bristles, which did not obviously interfere with the mating success of these transgenic males. in addition to laboratory tests, field cage tests  <cit>  with ll # <dig> males showed a comparable or even better competitiveness than wt .

discussion
in this study we describe the first transgenic embryonic lethality system for the insect pest c. capitata that causes complete reproductive sterility without the need of radiation. the use of a newly isolated early embryonic p/e of medfly makes possible a conditional embryonic lethality without larval hatching. the described embryonic lethality system has the advantage of eliminating the radiation process, a possible release of insects at any life-cycle stage, and an expected fitness benefit of transgenic males over radiated males. other transgenic lethality systems without the need of radiation, such as ridl  <cit> , reduce the eclosion rate of flies, but as larvae are still produced, larval damage to targeted food would still be present and transgenes would be transferred into the wild population due to pupal survival. these transgenes would carry along transgenesis markers that will also interfere with effective monitoring of sit programs. in contrast, the newly developed embryonically lethal medfly strains produce reproductively sterile males, which would mate to wt females after release and their progeny would die during embryogenesis. this would prevent larval hatching and the introgression of transgenes into wt medfly populations.

in the presented embryonic lethality system, the tta expression mediated by cellularization-specific p/es not only depends on the p/e itself but also on the integration sites in the genome. these differences in expression led to a variety of lethality levels in the  <dig> tested transgene combinations. interestingly, the basal promoters of the p element  and hsp <dig>  from d. melanogaster were both able to drive the lethal factor hidala <dig> after tre-mediated activation by tta in c. capitata. however, effectors containing the p basal promoter could not promote complete lethality, whereas systems with effectors containing hs <dig>  which gave no functional transgenes in d. melanogaster  <cit> , caused complete lethality in medfly at different stages of development. this demonstrates that even a molecularly well-constructed system is highly dependent on the specific p/es used and on the integration sites of the transgenes.

the additional finding that both constructs of the lethal and competitive lls # <dig> and # <dig> are located on chromosome  <dig> has several advantages. first, these lines can be combined with different well-established systems located on chromosome 5: e.g. a phenotypic marker system  <cit>  or part of a genetic sexing system, as in genetic sexing strain  vienna- <dig>  <cit> . the advantage of having different systems on chromosome  <dig> is a simplified quality control during rearing procedures. second, the embryonic lethality line brings about two fluorescent markers , which are not only helpful during quality control but could also help in monitoring processes. third, our constructs introduced attp sequences, which will allow to site-specifically modify these competitive embryonic lls by using the integrase system from phage phic <dig>  <cit> . possible applications will be the deletion of piggybac ends  <cit>  to further increase the safety of transgenes or insertion of recently developed sperm markers for improved monitoring  <cit> .

to suppress lethality during mass rearing, tc or dox can be used as a supplement in the food. in laboratory assays, we were able to reduce the tc concentrations in rearing media to  <dig>  μg/ml at larval and to a minimum of  <dig> μg/ml at adult stage. using these tc concentrations for rearing, we could not detect any hidala <dig> expression during embryogenesis. dox at  <dig> μg/ml in the adult food was sufficient to maternally suppress the embryonic lethality without the need for dox in the larval food. however, eclosion rates were reduced when dox was used in the adult food only, which suggests the need for some tc or dox in the larval food. in addition, we observed a delayed ovary development and postponed egg laying when  <dig> μg/ml tc was used in larval medium in combination with  <dig> μg/ml used in adult medium. the described tc concentrations for the embryonic lethality system are 10– <dig> times lower than published tc concentrations needed to suppress lethality of other medfly lethality systems  <cit> . compared with these other transgenic systems, the much lower tc concentrations would reduce costs of mass rearing.

both lls # <dig> and # <dig> show high competitiveness to wt flies in laboratory tests and ll # <dig> also in field cage tests. these transgenic lls can now be used to evaluate the fitness costs of transgenic lethality compared with radiation-based sterility. the current 100-fold inundation of affected areas with radiation-sterilized males could be reduced to lower amounts with more competitive lls and at the same time embryonic lethality could be maintained. we show that the embryonic ll # <dig> is a '100% sterility'-system. such systems are required for preventional sit programs in california or florida  <cit>  and are desired for every other pest management program. using the embryonic lethal strains would eliminate the problem of introducing transgenes into wild medfly populations by surviving flies as described for the conditional lethality system in gong et al.  <cit> . in addition, the use of the embryonic lethality system without the need of radiation can increase the safety of the mass-rearing process during operational sit programs, since accidental releases would not lead to infestations of the environment  <cit>  and possible risks coming from isotopic sources could be eliminated for workers and the environment.

CONCLUSIONS
the first successful transfer of the drosophila proof-of-principle embryonic lethality system to an agricultural pest, the medfly c. capitata, represents a straightforward approach that can be applied to further pest insects. we show that complete embryonic lethality in c. capitata is possible and that the responsible transgenes do not reduce competitiveness. the 100% embryonic lethal system is proposed as an alternative to reproductive sterility achieved by radiation for pest management programs based on the sterile insect technique.
