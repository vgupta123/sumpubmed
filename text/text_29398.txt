BACKGROUND
the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells allow the biosynthesis of lipids and of secreted and membrane proteins to be separated from the barrier function of the plasma membrane. they also allow the remodeling of the cell surface and the uptake of large molecules and even of other organisms. although some prokaryotes have internal organelles, these lack the complexity seen in eukaryotes and also the trafficking routes that connect the organelles into pathways  <cit> . however, this complexity and connectivity presents eukaryotic cells with a major organizational challenge, as vesicles and other carriers must select particular cargo from their site of generation, and then move toward, and fuse with, specific target organelles. the specificity of cargo selection is determined by coat proteins and their adaptors, with the recruitment of coats being directed by phosphoinositides or by members of the arf family of small g proteins  <cit> . however, the movement and arrival of vesicles is directed for the most part by small g proteins of the rab family, with the soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors  then driving membrane fusion  <cit> .

originally identified in yeast, the rab proteins have now emerged as the largest and most diverse family within the 'landmark' molecules that specify the identity of vesicles and organelles  <cit> . they are typically anchored to the bilayer by a long flexible hypervariable domain that ends in a prenylated c terminus. in the gtp-bound form, rabs bind effectors, but when the gtp is hydrolyzed through the action of a gtpase activating protein , they are extracted from the bilayer by a carrier protein called gdp dissociation inhibitor   <cit> . thus the activating exchange factors  and gaps of rabs act in concert to establish a restricted subcellular distribution for each particular rab-gtp form, and this gtp form then serves as a landmark for the recruitment of those proteins that need to act in that location. rab-gtp effectors include linkers to motor proteins and tethering factors that attach vesicles to the correct organelle before fusion.

although rabs are members of the ras superfamily of small g proteins, they share features that allow them to be clustered within a monophyletic branch of this family, with their closest relatives being the ran family which directs nuclear transport  <cit> . the genomes of all eukaryotes encode multiple members of the rab family, with humans having  <dig> and even the simplest eukaryotes having more than  <dig> rabs.  <cit> . studies of rab conservation have shown that their numbers and presence varies considerably between different phyla, and even between different species within phyla  <cit> . thus, studies on rabs have great potential to shed light on the evolution of eukaryotic endomembrane systems, and have already provided useful insights into this issue  <cit> . however, the complex history of rabs, including independent losses, duplications and diversifications, means that providing a full catalogue of rab diversity and evolutionary history is a major challenge.

in this study, we used a classification and phylogeny-based approach to define subfamilies of the rab proteins, and then iteratively built and refined hidden markov models  for these subfamilies to use for searching sequence databases. finally, we built evolutionary trees using maximum likelihood and distance-based methods. this provided the most comprehensive view of rab evolution obtained to date, and we have established a rab database web server to make the classifiers and full analysis available. examining the patterns of rab evolution demonstrates the striking degree of rab complexity in the last eukaryotic common ancestor , and provides insights into the evolution of membranes prior to the leca. in addition, it is clear that many rabs have proven dispensable during evolution whereas a small set have been well conserved, or have even expanded in particular lineages, and in some cases these changes can be correlated with changes in cellular properties, or can even be used to predict function.

RESULTS
a hidden markov model-based classification of rab protein sequences
we started our classification by collecting known rab protein sequences from  <dig> widely diverse species. after aligning the sequences and removing those of low quality, we obtained a first set of approximately  <dig> sequences from which we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree and clustered similar sequences . we extracted a conserved core rab motif from the constructed alignment, partitioned it into sub-alignments according to the different initial sequence groups and constructed an hmm for each one. finally, we used these models to search genome and expressed sequence tag  databases for further rab sequences. with the expanded dataset we repeated the analysis and refined the set of specific hmms. this process was repeated until no further improvement in the classification was achieved. finally, we supplemented our dataset with data from further species, obtaining more than  <dig> different rab sequences from more than  <dig> species representing all major eukaryotic phyla. for  <dig> of these species we found genome projects listed in the genomes on line database   <cit> . the analysis contained  <dig> metazoans ,  <dig> fungi ,  <dig> plants ,  <dig> apicomplexans ,  <dig> heterokonts , and  <dig> kinetoplastids .

identifying the rabs of the last eukaryotic common ancestor
our classification analysis identified a set of  <dig> basic rab types . deducing which of these rab types were present in the leca was complicated by the fact that the placement of the root in the eukaryotic tree of life is still under debate  <cit> . what is perhaps the most widely accepted hypothesis places the eukaryotic root between the bikonts and unikonts  <cit> . other possible scenarios reported to date include rooting the tree within or close to excavata  <cit> , and studies of rare genomic changes have led to the proposal of a root between archaeplastidia and all other eukaryotes  <cit> . we inspected the effect of these different hypotheses on the set of likely leca rabs, and found that the presence of the same  <dig> rabs in the leca was supported by two of the three trees . the exception was the tree based on the archaeplastida outgroup, in which the number of leca rabs reduced to  <dig> of these  <dig>  however, it should be noted that in this model the position of the excavates was uncertain, with the authors stressing the need for 'extreme caution'  <cit> , and if the excavates were placed with the archaeplastida, then the number of leca rabs would again be  <dig> 

it is also formally possible that rabs have moved between kingdoms by horizontal gene transfer, but the trees for the  <dig> rabs generally fit well with species evolution. in addition, horizontal gene transfer after endosymbiosis would probably have involved a non-unikont species as the donor and so would not have increased the number of rab families in the bikonts. if one divides eukaryotic phyla into the four proposed supergroups , then of the  <dig> putative leca rabs,  <dig> are present in at least three . the exception was rab <dig>  whose only occurrences outside of unikonts were found in naegleria gruberi  and thecamonas trahens   <cit> . thus, rab <dig> seems to be the only equivocal rab in our proposed set of  <dig> leca rabs. given these observations and caveats, we have based our further discussion on the cautious assumption that all  <dig> basic rab types were in the leca.

for each of these  <dig> basic types we constructed hmms. however, this basic set has diversified over time in all major phyla, and especially in metazoans. for the majority of these diversifications, it is clear from which leca rab they descended; however, we found a number of lineage-specific rab types that have diverged substantially from their ancestors, making them difficult to place with one of the leca rabs. this problem is especially present in protozoan lineages for which only few species have been sequenced to date. for a few metazoan duplications, we used an approach based on sequence similarity to identify their ancestral rab type . to better distinguish basic rabs from those that developed later, we supplemented the generated hmms with  <dig> further models that recognize metazoan-specific types, and especially those that were difficult to place. other eukaryotic lineages with extensive genome sequence coverage, such as fungi and plants, do not possess such diversified rab sets, and so for these cases we did not need to generate further specific hmms.

all our models showed at least 95% sensitivity and positive predictive value . thus, the structure of the rab family tree developed from our analysis appears to be robust, allowing considerable confidence in its implications. we have implemented a web interface called the rab database which provides access the collected information and allows searches with new proteins against our hmm-based classifiers .

the history of rab evolution shows some striking features, including an unexpectedly large number of different rabs present in the leca. these twenty leca rabs can be arranged into six supergroups, which has implications for the evolution of the membrane system prior to the leca. during the subsequent divergence of eukaryotes many of the leca rabs have been lost in particular lineages, whereas other families have expanded, and in some cases it is possible to correlate this with loss or gain of particular cellular processes. these points are discussed in detail below.

the last eukaryotic common ancestor had a large repertoire of rabs
our analysis identifies a set of  <dig> rab proteins that are likely to have been present in the leca based on the arguments above . of these proteins, rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  and rab <dig> are known likely candidates, and rab <dig>  rab <dig>  and rabl <dig> have just recently been added to this list  <cit> . to these proteins we can now add rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rabx <dig>  and rab7l <dig>  this total of  <dig> is larger than that found in many extant eukaryotic phyla, such as plants and fungi. this indicates that the endomembrane system of the leca was relatively complex, consistent with studies of proteins involved in other cellular processes such as the cytoskeleton, all of which have indicated that the leca was a particularly complex and sophisticated cell  <cit> .

it is well established that the leca must have had a golgi apparatus, and the capacity for both endocytosis and phagocytosis  <cit> . this would be consistent with the roles that many of these rabs have been reported to play in extant eukaryotes. thus rab <dig>  rab <dig>  and rab <dig> are on the golgi, and rab <dig> acts in golgi to plasma membrane traffic, while rabs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are in the endosomal system, and are thus likely to have acted in endocytic and phagocytic processes of the leca cell. these processes will have allowed uptake of food sources, as well of recycling of components to the cell surface, and possibly the fusion of a contractile vacuole to expel water  <cit> . likewise, rabl <dig> 27) and rab <dig> are known to be involved in cilia/flagella formation or function in extant eukaryotes, consistent with other proteins specific to these structures being found in all eukaryotic kingdoms and thus present in the leca  <cit> .

of the remaining seven leca rabs, rab <dig> and its paralogs in extant eukaryotes  are well established to be involved in forming lysosome-related organelles  such as melanosomes, platelet dense granules and alveolar lamellar bodies  <cit> . rab <dig> and rab7l <dig> are distantly related , and the latter has been proposed to also have a role in granules derived from endosomal system  <cit> . it can only be speculated as to how the leca may have used lros, but obvious possibilities include pigment granules to block sunlight, secretory granules to combat competitors, or granules that fused with phagosomes to aid killing of phagocytosed bacteria in the manner of neutrophils  <cit> . of the few non-metazoans that have conserved this rab, phytophthora contain a large number of granules in their motile zoospores, which are released during encystation to rapidly reform the cell wall, concomitant with a loss of motility  <cit> .

this leaves four rabs  whose role even in extant eukaryotes is unclear, although their ancient origins suggest that they may have more fundamental roles than previously thought. of these, rab <dig> is the best characterized, with several reports suggesting a role on the endoplasmic reticulum , either in lipid droplet formation or in golgi to er traffic  <cit> . however, despite rab <dig> being well conserved in many eukaryotic phyla, human patients lacking rab <dig> do not show obvious defects in lipid storage or general secretion, and so the role of rab <dig> remains unclear  <cit> . however, it is possible that rab <dig> may have a partially redundant role with rab <dig>  as in humans it seems to have expanded from rab <dig> during metazoan evolution . of the remaining three leca rabs, rab <dig> has been linked to autophagy, but cannot be obligatory for this process as it is conserved in only a very few non-metazoan phyla, and rab <dig> has been linked to endosome function in trypanosomes, but little is known of its role in metazoans  <cit> . finally, rabx <dig> is conserved in only a few sequenced genomes across several phyla, including various invertebrates but not vertebrates. in drosophila, it is expressed primarily in the nervous system, and a p-element insertion next to the gene perturbs development of the peripheral nervous system  <cit> .

rab expansion during the period of evolution leading to the last eukaryotic common ancestor
many eukaryotic-specific genes were already present in the leca as families, which indicates that they must have duplicated and diverged in the period between the earliest eukaryote and the leca. the rabs are a particularly extreme case of this, and our analysis allows insights into how this family emerged. during the iterative refinement of our analysis, it became apparent that the twenty leca rabs fell into a set of six larger supergroups, suggesting a primitive pre-leca eukaryote with just six rabs. the tree  shows the relationship between the different leca rabs, and provides statistical support for this observation. interestingly, each of these six supergroups comprised rabs that are mostly associated with one particular process, consistent with diversification from a simpler system in which there was a single rab for each of the following: secretion , early endosomes , late endosomes , recycling from endosomes to the surface , recycling from endosomes to golgi , and traffic associated with cilia/flagella .

rab family evolution during the diversification of the eukaryotes
comparing the leca rabs with those present in extant eukaryotic phyla revealed two striking patterns. firstly, many rabs have been lost in at least some lineages, despite being conserved in others, with relatively few rabs seeming to be indispensible . secondly, some rab families have expanded greatly in particular kingdoms . in both cases, it was sometimes possible to correlate these genetic changes to changes in cell structure and function. below we discuss these two aspects of rab evolution in detail.

rab losses during eukaryotic evolution
although the leca seems to have had at least  <dig> rabs, most of these are clearly not essential for eukaryotic life, as many have been lost in one or more kingdoms . indeed, of the twenty rabs present in the leca, only five seem near-indispensible, in that they are present in almost all well-characterized genomes reported to date. these are rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig>  which correspond precisely to five of the six supergroups present in the leca, with the remaining supergroup probably being that linked to cilia/flagella. this again suggests that membrane traffic is fundamentally underpinned by just five rabs. note that even these 'indispensible' five show some losses in a few very reduced or parasitic eukaryotes such as the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi, and although all five are present in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, remarkably three of the five  are not actually essential for the viability of this yeast. in addition to these core five rabs, there are three rabs that are only rarely lost in free living eukaryotes: rab <dig> and rab <dig>  and rab <dig> . it may be that these three can be lost because the 'indispensible' rab in their group can sometimes take over their role, and, indeed, it has been shown for s. cerevisiae that a single chimeric rab can perform the roles of both rab <dig> and rab <dig>  <cit> .

consistent with the leca having a large rab repertoire, there is evidence that several eukaryotic kingdoms contain more rabs than do many of that kingdom's individual species . for instance, basal fungi have already lost seven of the twenty leca rabs , but it is apparent that further rabs were lost during the expansion of the fungal kingdom. all non-basal fungi have also lost rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rabl <dig>  in addition, rab <dig> has been lost in all saccharomycotina, while rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rabx <dig> are still present in yarrowia lipolytica but seem to have been lost in all later saccharomycotina, including s. cerevisiae, leaving the latter with orthologs of only six of the leca rabs. for plants, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> leca rabs are present in the chlorophyta. interestingly, all more derived plants have lost three additional leca members . in addition, angiosperms have also lost rab <dig>  and so even these complex multicellular eukaryotes lack almost half of the rabs present in the leca.

in some cases, it is possible to correlate loss of particular sets of rabs with changes in cellular organization. rabs linked to cilia and flagella  and rab23), have been lost in those organisms that have also lost these structures, in particular most plants and fungi. this loss is often associated with the organism gaining a cell wall, and such a structure would also prevent phagocytosis of large objects. this provides a possible explanation for the loss of rab <dig> in these lineages, as this rab is recruited to phagosomes in both mammals and dictyostelium  <cit> . in other cases, genome compaction may have driven rab loss, as particularly small rab repertoires are present in organisms with compacted genomes such as the microalgae ostreococcus, or the budding yeasts, although it is also possible that this is an indirect consequence of a general simplification of the intracellular membrane-traffic systems of these organisms.

rab expansions
while many rabs show a history of extensive independent losses, there have also been many cases in which rab families have expanded by gene duplication and diversification. metazoans show expansions in twelve different leca rabs, plants in eight, heterokonts in five, apicomplexans in three, fungi in two and kinetoplastids in just one . we discuss these expansions briefly for each of the six supergroups of rabs.

group i: rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab18
this supergroup has a particularly complex history of expansions and losses. rab <dig> is the 'indispensible' member of the supergroup, and seems to have been duplicated a number of times in metazoans . the addition of rab <dig> seems to predate the rise of metazoans, as we could also identify it in capsaspora owczarzaki, which branched off from the pre-metazoan lineage after fungi but before choanoflagellates. rabx <dig> appeared in metazoans, but is one of the few rabs that is lost in vertebrates. rab <dig> has duplicated independently in most other phyla, including apicomplexans  and heterokonts   <cit> . in angiosperms, there are three different rab <dig> proteins, apparently expanded from one in bryophyta.

rab <dig> has probably the most complex history of the leca rabs. it has been independently triplicated in heterokonts and, similar to rab <dig>  it has been duplicated in angiosperms but not in bryophyta. more strikingly, it has a large set of duplications in metazoans . rab <dig> and rab <dig> are two of three rabs that have an additional domain present, with two ef hand motifs present in the n-terminal region of the protein. many of these rab families have expanded further in vertebrates, but a few, such as rabx <dig>  have been lost. although rabx <dig> is present in insects and not in vertebrates, it is also present in a few genomes of more primitive metazoans , indicating that it arose early in metazoan evolution and was widely lost. in addition, rab <dig> seems to have undergone another duplication in deuterostomes  and two in vertebrates .

by contrast, rab <dig> seems to have a rather simple evolutionary history, being present in all major clades and only being lost in saccharomycotina. it shows a duplication in angiosperms and also duplication in bilateria , which expanded further in vertebrates  and then in primates .

group ii: rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rabx1
rab <dig> is apparently indispensible, and also has the most complex evolutionary history of this supergroup. it seems to have been duplicated independently in basal fungi after the loss of their flagellum , and also in apicomplexans  and kinetoplastids . in addition, it has quadrupled in vertebrates . similarly, there are independent duplications in saccharomycotina  and in angiospermae .

rab <dig> and rab <dig> have no major expansions , and have been lost in members of several phyla. rab <dig> is rather unusual as it is well conserved in metazoans, where it has also been duplicated , but it seems to have been lost in most other species. however, we could detect members of this group in a small but diverse group of species outside of unikonts, indicating that it was present in the leca . the final member of this group, rabx <dig>  is one of the few that seem to have been lost in vertebrates; however, it is well conserved in insects and nematodes, as well being present in heterokonts and fungi .

group iii: rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab7l1
rab <dig> seems to be indispensible, and is also the member of the family that shows the most expansions. there are four rab7s in angiosperms, and metazoans have a rab <dig> relative, rab <dig>  previous analysis has dated the duplication that formed rab <dig> to the rise of the metazoans  <cit> . however, we identified a conserved set of fungal proteins that must either be an independent duplication of fungal rab <dig> or must belong to the rab <dig> subfamily, and hence rab <dig> appeared with the opisthokonts. our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the latter possibility seems to be more likely. in addition, we found this special fungal version of the protein not only in a wide variety of fungi, but also in very basal fungi species, strengthening our view that these sequences are indeed members of the rab <dig> family.

rab <dig> and rab <dig> show extensive patterns of loss, which in the case of rab <dig> correlate well to loss of cilia or flagella, consistent with functional work on this protein  <cit> . rab <dig> shows no duplications, whereas rab <dig> has been duplicated in vertebrates . rab7l <dig> and rab <dig> have been independently lost in fungi, plants, apicomplexans, and kinetoplastids, but for rab7l <dig>  we identified a number of related sequences in diverse non-unikont species and in metazoans, including humans . as noted above, the assignment of rab <dig> as a leca rab rather than being unikont-specific is based on rab <dig> being in one excavate with a high score to our rab <dig> model, with a rab29-like sequence also being found in the phylogenetically elusive apusozoa. interestingly, rab <dig> has also been lost in vertebrates. the relationship between rab7l <dig> and rab <dig> is not completely clear, as several metazoan species seem to have lost one or other group. however, we found sequences from choanoflagellates and from c. owczarzaki, corresponding to both groups. we have used the names rab <dig> and rab7l <dig> for these two groups because they have been used for members of the two groups previously; however this has not been consistent, thus if confirmed by more genomes, adopting new names for these two proteins may help avoid confusion.

group iv: rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab14
rab <dig> seems to be the indispensible member of this supergroup, and is certainly the only rab from this family that is still present in saccharomycotina, where it has duplicated . overall, rab <dig> presents a unique pattern of duplications. apicomplexa contain two rab <dig> genes, and there has been a large expansion in plants. there are three different rab <dig> genes in bryophyta ; these genes expanded to  <dig> versions in angiosperms and arabidopsis thaliana possesses  <dig> different rab <dig> genes. in heterokonts, we can observe some independent duplications of rab <dig> genes, including oomycetes which have seven rab <dig> genes.

rab <dig> is present in all major eukaryotic phyla and has been independently duplicated in metazoa , heterokonts  and angiosperms , but has been lost in all more derived saccharomycotina species. by contrast, rab <dig> and rab <dig> have no major duplications  and have both been lost in several phyla.

group v: rab6
rab <dig> seems to be indispensible, but we found no expansions in the genomes examined. apart from one in angiospermae and, like many other rabs, an expansion in vertebrates . in the latter case, there was a later expansion to generate rab <dig>  which is present in primates and dolphins, and a further expansion due to a reactivated retrotransposed pseudogene, which seems to be specific to hominidae .

group iv: rab <dig> and rabl4
neither of these rabs is indispensible, with many losses and no expansions apart from a duplication of rab <dig> in heterokonts. rabl <dig>  has been clearly linked to the function of flagella and cilia, and its pattern of conservation fits well with the presence of these important but not ubiquitous structures  <cit> . interestingly, the phylogenetic profile of rab <dig> is rather similar to that of rabl <dig>  suggesting that its function may also be linked to cilia or flagella. rabl <dig> has no prenylation site, and our analysis gives strong support to separating this group from the other rabs . this may indicate that these groups are not classic rab proteins, but would be better placed somewhere between the ran and rab supergroups of the ras family.

what has driven the expansion of particular rab families?
the striking expansion of rabs in humans seems to have been caused by two separate processes: one at the start of metazoan evolution and a second that occurred at the appearance of vertebrates. comparing the rabs of metazoans with those of choanoflagellates, which are the closest relatives of metazoans, the appearance of  <dig> new rab proteins can be seen in metazoans . interestingly, the large majority  of these new rab proteins appeared in group i, indicating an early diversification of the exocytic pathway. it seems likely that this is associated with several changes in cellular organization. not only are metazoans multicellular, but they also form polarized cell sheets, hence proteins need to be trafficked to different domains on the cell surface. in addition, even early metazoans seem to have had neuroendocrine cells that communicated with their neighbors, presumably by regulated release of compounds stored in vesicles  <cit> . these extra processes will have required diversification of the rab machinery that is involved in delivery to the cell surface, and indeed, many of the relatives of rab <dig> are believed to be involved in such processes. several members of this family seem to be expressed primarily in the brain, and in some cases have been clearly shown to function in neurotransmitter release   <cit> . it also seems possible that more complex patterns of exocytosis would have required a concomitant elaboration of pathways of endocytic recycling, which may account for the expansion of the rab <dig> family to generate more rabs associated with golgi functions, such as rab19/ <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig>  by contrast, plants and fungi show no expansion of rab <dig>  suggesting that it was protein-mediated interactions between cells without cell walls, rather than multicellularity per se, which drove the rab explosion in early metazoans.

the second major expansion in rab numbers took place during the rise of the vertebrates, most likely through two rounds of whole genome duplications, expanding their set from  <dig> to  <dig> rab proteins . in contrast to the first event, the effect of the expansion in vertebrates can be seen in all major groups, and indeed, many other vertebrate families show such an expansion from one gene to two, three or four paralogous genes . in the case of the rabs these extra paralogs may have acquired subtly different roles, but in some cases, the paralogs are expressed in different sets of tissues, which may have contributed to their conservation  <cit> .

rationalizing rab expansions in other kingdoms is made more difficult by the more restricted number of genomes available. however, it is at least clear that in plants several rab families have also expanded, with the most notable being rab <dig>  which diversified even in bryophyta. this also explains how the angiospermae were able to encompass such a large variety of rab <dig> proteins . rab <dig> is involved in recycling back to the plasma membrane, and diversification of such routes to the plasma membrane seem likely to be important for cell plate formation during mitosis, for polarized growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, and for the targeted delivery of auxin transporters that underlies the spatial organization of some multicellular structures in plants  <cit> .

discussion
using probabilistic models and advanced tree building methods, we have been able to build the most comprehensive evolutionary tree of the rab family that has been reported to date. in our analysis, we defined the rab family as being distinct from the ran family, and thus excluded some proteins which have been referred to as rab-like but which are more likely to be 'ran-like' or have roles distinct from rabs. these include rabl <dig>  rabl <dig>  and rabl <dig> 

our findings confirm and extend the evidence that the leca had a large number of rabs  <cit> . if our size estimate of leca rab repertoire is incorrect, it will, if anything, prove to be an underestimate once more genome sequences become available from non-metazoan organisms, in particular protozoa. indeed after our analysis was completed, elias et al.  <cit>  reported an analysis of leca rabs using a different method to identify evolutionary relationships applied to only  <dig> species, and concluded that the leca could have contained  <dig> rabs. although this 'scrollsaw' method was not validated with well established protein families, and found only two of the six supergroups we have identified, there is nonetheless a reassuring overlap of  <dig> rabs with our leca repertoire  and rabx <dig> ). the one extra rab in our proposed set is rab <dig>  which elias et al did not distinguish from rab7l <dig>  possibly due to their use of a smaller genome set, but as discussed above, we felt we could tentatively include rab7l <dig> in the leca repertoire, based not only on it being in amoeboza and metazoans, but also on it being an excavate sequence that scores above the strict cut-off with our rab <dig> hmm. elias et al. also suggest that the leca contained four further rabs that we did not include; rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rabl <dig> , and a new family that they named rabtitan. they based rab <dig> on four sequences outside of unikonts, but in each case the relevant sequence gave a higher score with our rab <dig> model, and the organism concerned had no other rab <dig> in its genome, suggesting that these really are rab24s. the inclusion by elias et al. of rab <dig> is based on a rab34-like sequence that is present in one non-unikont genome . with our rab <dig> hmm, this sequence gave a score below the strict cut-off point, and so we felt it premature to include this protein. we also did not include rtw/rabl <dig>  as it is well established to be an outlier from the rab family that is more closely related to ran, and so is unlikely to be a rab  <cit> . rabtitan is based on a set of rather distantly related sequences from several kingdoms, but all lack c-terminal cysteines and seem only very distantly related to the rabs. we tested a 'rabtitan' from a metazoan , an amoebozoan  and a excavate , and in each case we obtained a much lower score for our general rab hmm than for either ran or rho/rac from the corresponding species. to determine from which g proteins these rabtitans evolved will probably require a phylogenetic analysis of the entire ras superfamily.

irrespective of whether any further rabs will be added to the leca repertoire, it now seems unambiguously established that the repertoire was large, probably consisting of at least  <dig> members, which strongly supports the notion that the leca had a complex set of internal organelles and trafficking steps  <cit> . this is consistent with the 'complexity early' model of eukaryotic evolution that has been suggested by examining other families of proteins such as cytoskeletal components and motors  <cit> . the notion that a single-celled leca needed such complexity in its internal membranes is consistent with the rab repertoires of more than  <dig> members found in some extant single-cellular protozoa  <cit> .

the widespread loss of rabs during the diversification of eukaryotes probably reflects in part the loss of particular structures or processes during specialization. these include cilia/flagella and a capacity for phagocytosis. interestingly, a leca rab of unknown function, rab <dig>  has a phylogenetic distribution similar to that of cilia, and it groups with rabl <dig>  a rab known to be involved in cilia function. thus we suggest that rab <dig> is a candidate for a role in cilia formation or function. in addition, the requirements for membrane-trafficking events during cytokinesis are likely to have changed as this process has diversified greatly in different lineages  <cit> .

it is possible that some cases of rab loss reflect overlap in function between particular rabs that belong in the same family, even if they have diverged from a common ancestor in the leca. for instance, rab <dig> and rab <dig> were both present in the leca, but are part of the same fundamental group of rabs and have been found to share some effectors  <cit> . this may have allowed rab <dig> to have been lost more readily than if rab <dig> had not been present to take over some of its roles. likewise, mammalian rab <dig> shares the same binding site on some effectors with other leca rabs of its group, rab <dig> and rab <dig>  and again the latter have often been lost during evolution  <cit> . such 'cryptic' redundancy suggests that caution may be needed in interpreting the effects of deleting particular rabs; that is, a failure to see a perturbation of a particular process need not imply that the rab that has been deleted is not normally involved in that process. this is more likely to be the case for rabs that have duplicated more recently in evolution, and may explain the surprisingly mild phenotypes observed after loss of some mammalian rabs such as rab <dig> or the rab <dig> family, as both have relatives that arose from duplications at the dawn of metazoan evolution  <cit> .

not only have some rabs been lost, but also new ones have been gained by gene duplication and divergence. a large increase in the rab repertoire occurred at the root of the metazoan lineage, which may be linked to multicellularity without a cell wall, and hence the opportunity for intracellular contacts and communications to be mediated by proteins directed to the cell surface. in most cases it seems likely that the duplications generated rabs that carry out spatially or functionally related roles. however, there are one or two enigmatic exceptions; for instance, rab <dig> is related to rab <dig> and yet has a role in endocytosis at the plasma membrane rather than acting at the golgi  <cit> , while rab <dig> emerged in a leca group with rab <dig>  rab <dig>  and rab <dig>  and yet acts on the golgi rather than on endosomes  <cit> .

for the non-metazoan kingdoms, a lack of sufficient genome sequences restricts a deep understanding of rab expansions, although plants seem to have expanded rab <dig>  <cit> . the protozoans paramecium, trichomonas, entamoeba and tetrahymena have greatly expanded their rab repertoires, perhaps reflecting the complex endocytic/phagocytic routes in these organisms and their elaborate cilia or flagella, but understanding the history of these expansions will require more genome sequences from other excavates and chromalveolates  <cit> .

a second round of rab expansion occurred in vertebrates as a result of the two rounds of genome duplication that seem to have happened early in vertebrate evolution and that also generated paralogs for many other gene families  <cit> . it remains to be determined which of these new rabs have been conserved because they had different functions or different expression patterns  <cit> . however, it is clear that the naming of these paralogs has not been consistent, with some being distinguished with letters  and others by new numbers. for instance, rab <dig> could be rab11c, and rab <dig> and rab <dig> could be rab34a and rab34b. adopting a consistent nomenclature for the vertebrate rabs might avoid some confusion, and in particular the risk that potentially highly redundant paralogs are overlooked because they have different numbers. these anomalies and our suggested 'rational' names for human rabs are shown in figure  <dig> 

finally, it is interesting to compare the evolutionary patterns of rabs with those of other components of membrane traffic. known vesicle coat proteins - <dig> to ap- <dig>  retromer) and multi-subunit tethering complexes , golgi-associated retrograde protein , exocyst, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting  and transport protein particle ) have undergone little expansion since the leca, indicating that their different subtypes correspond to the fundamental routes of traffic  <cit> . these protein families must be the core components of ancient machineries involved in the fundamental steps of vesicle budding and fusion, which diversified during evolution of the leca to adapt to the needs of specialized compartments. the snare protein families show a post-leca diversification pattern comparable with that of rabs; for example, during the rise of metazoans, the development of vertebrates  <cit> , and in angiosperms  <cit> . in addition, metazoan snare diversification is, like rab <dig> expansion, associated with those snares involved in transport steps to the plasma membrane. however, the rab proteins show a much more extensive and dynamic gain-and-loss history, with snare proteins having a tendency to become essential 'housekeeping' genes. for example, s. cerevisiae has retained only  <dig> of the  <dig> leca rabs but  <dig> of the  <dig> leca snares.

this greater diversity in rab evolution may reflect the fact that it is difficult to duplicate a coat, a tethering complex, or a snare tetramer, as they are encoded by multiple genes. more importantly, it suggests that a particular rab can be gained or lost without a concomitant gain or loss of any of the known members of the known coat, snare, or tethering complex families. this is rather unexpected, as it implies that either these components are associated only with those rabs that are 'indispensible', or that the rabs only add functionality to existing processes, or, as seems likely in at least some cases, new rabs can add transport steps without the cell having to evolve new coats, tethering complexes, or snares. this suggests that rabs have directed the evolutionary plasticity of membrane traffic, and hence, by implication, they encode much of its specificity. given that the function of many rabs, including some of those that were present in the leca, is poorly understood, it seems certain that there is still much to learn about the involvement of rabs in the organization of internal organelles and trafficking pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we built an evolutionary tree of the rab family that reconstructs the repertoire of rabs in the leca and accounts for the origins of all  <dig> rabs in the human genome. the twenty different rabs of the leca seem to have arisen by duplication and diversification of six fundamental rab types, which probably can be assigned to the fundamental routes of membrane traffic. indeed, many extant eukaryotes have fewer rabs than the leca, although in some cases this has been balanced by expansion and diversification of the remaining rab set. the metazoans seem to be the kingdom that has lost fewest of the leca rabs, although all individual phyla within metazoans have lost one or more of them. patterns of rab loss or expansion can in some cases be correlated with changes in membrane-traffic processes, and we found that a leca rab of unknown function, rab <dig>  showed a pattern of loss similar to that of cilia, suggesting a role for the protein. the evolutionary plasticity of rabs has been much greater than that of other membrane-traffic components such as coats, tethers, and even snares. this suggests that variation in rabs has been used during evolution to augment membrane-traffic processes and even to invent new ones, and hence to generate the diversity of organelle function that exists between different cell types and organisms.
