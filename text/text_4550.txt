BACKGROUND
recent technical advances in the molecular estimation of divergence times have provided molecular evolutionists with promising tools to introduce reliable time scales to molecular phylogenetic trees  <cit> . one of the most significant advances common to these new methods is the departure from the molecular clock assumption, which in many cases does not strictly hold. another advance is the use of time constraints at multiple nodes, rather than the assignment of a discrete time value to a particular node, for rate calibration. this is useful because of the various uncertainties in divergence time estimations based on fossil evidence. in general, the occurrence of the earliest fossil assignable to a particular branch can define the lower boundary of divergence time for the node at which this branch departed from its sister branch  <cit> . however, when the corresponding fossil data are inadequate or sparse, the lower time boundary based on such data could considerably postdate the true divergence time, potentially leading to inaccurate or imprecise dating results  <cit> .

in general, fossils of bony fishes are not considered well preserved. of the  <dig> teleostean families,  <dig> families do not have a fossil record. of the remaining  <dig> that have fossil records,  <dig> have only otoliths  <cit> . thus, lower boundary values of divergence times based on teleostean fossil evidence could underestimate the true values  <cit> . therefore, alternative methods that may provide effective time constraints in dating teleostean divergences should be explored, e.g., methods based on reasonable biogeographic assumptions. because freshwater fishes do not disperse easily through saltwater, their evolution may be tightly linked to the geological history of the landmasses on which they evolved  <cit> . thus, evaluating the potential correlation of continental drift and lineage divergences in each of the freshwater fish groups that have multicontinental distributions is important  <cit> .

cichlids  are freshwater fishes that are mainly distributed in landmasses of gondwanaland origin   <cit> . they have experienced an explosive radiation in the great lakes of east africa, and they constitute one of the best-known model organisms for evolutionary biology  <cit> . phylogenetic studies based on morphological and molecular evidence have consistently recognized the monophyletic origin of the family, basal divergences of malagasy and indo/sri lankan taxa, and the sister-group relationship of african and south american clades  <cit> . these patterns of divergence among continental cichlid groups are entirely consistent with the geological history of continental drift, the proposed gondwanan origin of cichlidae, and subsequent vicariant divergences  <cit> . however, only a few molecular studies  <cit>  have attempted to evaluate this hypothesis by dating cichlid divergences; their different approaches led to opposite conclusions. genner et al.  <cit>  supported vicariant cichlid divergences during cretaceous times , whereas vences et al.  <cit>  suggested a cenozoic transmarine dispersal . the latter conclusion is more consistent with the eocene occurrence of the oldest cichlid fossils  <cit> .

we used molecular data obtained from complete mitochondrial dna  sequences to investigate these hypotheses. among the  <dig> fish taxa that we sampled, we newly determined the sequence data for six cichlid species. the two alternate hypotheses for cichlids, vicariant and dispersal ones, were evaluated by estimating the divergence times of the taxa using bayesian analyses that incorporated extensive fossil-based time constraints for various divergences. despite the relative paucity of fish fossil records, this set of time constraints allowed us to estimate cichlid divergence times with high enough resolution to discriminate between the two alternative hypotheses.

methods
taxonomic sampling
cichlid samples were obtained from local animal dealers in japan. we combined these new mitogenomic data with  <dig> previously published sequences from the ddbj/embl/genbank nucleotide sequence database. the  <dig> cichlid taxa that we analyzed  cover species from major gondwana-origin landmasses. in addition, we chose  <dig> other teleosts, nine basal actinopterygians, and two sarcopterygians. two sharks were sampled as an outgroup to root the tree. additional file  <dig> contains a complete list of the sampled taxa, along with the database accession numbers of their mitogenomic sequences.

*nearly complete mtdna sequences with the control region partially sequenced

dna extraction, pcr, and sequencing
fish samples were excised from live or dead specimens of each species and immediately preserved in  <dig> % ethanol. total genomic dna was extracted from muscle, liver, and/or fin clips using a dneasy tissue kit  or a dnazol reagent , following manufacturer protocols. the mtdna of each species was amplified using a long-pcr technique with la-taq . seven fish-versatile primers for long pcr  and the two cichlid-specific primers cichlid-la-16sh  and cichlid-la-16sl  were used in various combinations to amplify regions covering the entire mtdna in one or two reactions. the long-pcr products were used as templates for subsequent short pcr.

over  <dig> fish-versatile pcr primers  <cit>  and  <dig> taxon-specific primers  were used in various combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire mtdna for each of the six new cichlid species. the long pcr and subsequent short pcrs were performed as described previously  <cit> . the short-pcr reactions were performed using the geneamp pcr system  <dig>  and ex taq dna polymerase .

double-stranded pcr products, treated with exosap-it  to inactivate remaining primers and dntps, were directly used for the cycle sequencing reaction, using dye-labeled terminators  with amplification primers and appropriate internal primers. labeled fragments were analyzed on model  <dig> and model  <dig> dna sequencers .

sequence manipulation
the dna sequences obtained were edited and analyzed using editview  <dig> . <dig>  autoassembler  <dig>   and dnasis  <dig>  . individual gene sequences were identified and aligned with their counterparts in  <dig> previously published mitogenomes. amino acid sequences were used to align protein-coding genes, and standard secondary structure models for vertebrate mitochondrial trnas  <cit>  were consulted for the alignment of trna genes. the 12s and 16s rrna sequences were initially aligned using clustalx v.  <dig>   <cit>  with default gap penalties and subsequently adjusted by eye using macclade  <dig>   <cit> .

the nd <dig> gene was excluded from the phylogenetic analyses because of its heterogeneous base composition and consistently poor phylogenetic performance  <cit> . the control region was also excluded because positional homology was not confidently established among such distantly-related species. the third codon positions of protein genes were excluded because of their extremely accelerated rates of change that may cause high levels of homoplasy. after the exclusion of unalignable parts in the loop regions of trna genes, as well as the 5' and/or 3' end regions of protein genes, all gene sequences were concatenated to produce  <dig> -bp sites  for phylogenetic analyses.

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using partitioned bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. partitioned bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed using mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we set four partitions . the general time-reversible model, with some sites assumed to be invariable and variable sites assumed to follow a discrete gamma distribution , was selected as the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution by mrmodeltest  <dig>  http://www.abc.se/~nylander/ <cit> . the markov chain monte carlo  process was set so that four chains  ran simultaneously. we ran the program for  <dig> , <dig> metropolis-coupled mcmc generations on each analysis, with tree sampling every  <dig> generations and burn-in after  <dig>  trees.

partitioned maximum likelihood  analyses were performed with raxml ver.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , a program implementing a novel, rapid-hill-climbing algorithm. for each dataset, a rapid bootstrap analysis and search for the best-scoring ml tree were conducted in one single program run, with the gtr + i + Γ nucleotide substitution model. the rapid bootstrap analyses were conducted with  <dig> replications, with four threads running in parallel.

statistical evaluation of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses was done using tree- puzzle  <dig>   <cit> , using the two-sided kishino and hasegawa   <cit>  test, the shimodaira and hasegawa   <cit>  test, and bayes factors  <cit> . we used the gtr + i + Γ model and its parameters optimized by mrmodeltest  <dig> .

divergence time estimation
for the divergence time estimation, multidistribute program  <cit>  was used by assuming a topological relationship thus obtained, but without assuming the molecular clock . upper and/or lower time constraints at selected nodes were set for the bayesian mcmc processes to estimate divergence times  and relative rates at ingroup nodes. we set the partitioning as described above and first used paml  <cit>  to optimize the parameters of model f <dig> and the gamma distribution for eight categories to account for site heterogeneity. estbranches and multidivtime programs were then used to estimate divergence times. we used  <dig> fossil-based time constraints assignable to diverse teleostean lineages .

RESULTS
mitochondrial genomes of cichlids
we determined complete or nearly complete mtdna nucleotide sequences for six new cichlids from africa, south america, madagascar, and indo/sri lanka . the sizes of these genomes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, including approximately  <dig> bp in the control region. tylochromis polylepis alone appears to have a somewhat longer control region  although the exact sequence of the region was unable to be determined because of the long poly-t sequences within the region. we also analyzed the previously published mitogenomic sequences of four cichlid species . oreochromis mossambicus  was not included because a congeneric taxon  sequenced by mabuchi et al.  <cit>  had already been sampled.

all  <dig> genes encoding two rrnas,  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> proteins were identified in these  <dig> cichlid mitogenomes, basically in the same order and orientation found for most other vertebrates. transfer rna genes could be folded into secondary structures typical of vertebrate mitochondrial trna  <cit> . the base composition of cichlid mitogenomes was skewed  similarly to those of other vertebrates  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships
although inoue et al.  <cit>  suggested that the "ancient fish clade" unites acipenserids, lepisosteids, and amiid, our phylogenetic analysis supports the neopterygian clade , in agreement with an analysis of nuclear dna sequences  <cit>  and morphological characters  <cit> . relationships between the basal actinopterygians and teleosts were not stable against changes in taxonomic representations and the genes used and varied between the two hypotheses . we tentatively assumed the neopterygian relationship for subsequent analyses because this was consistent in both morphological and molecular  analyses. however, we also conducted analyses to evaluate how our major conclusions in dating depend on the two alternative phylogenetic relationships .

the means and 95% credibility ranges  are shown for estimated divergence times.

in terms of the relationships among  <dig> percomorphs containing  <dig> labroids , we reconfirmed the polyphyly of labroidei  <cit>  whereby labrids  and cichlids + pomacentirids  appear in separate lineages of teleosts. the non-monophyly of the labroid taxa was supported by a number of nodes with 100% posterior probability and 100% bootstrap values .

among the  <dig> cichlid taxa that we used, four were from africa, two from south america, three from madagascar, and one from indo/sri lanka. the tree  supports the monophyly of cichlidae and two other continental groups from africa and south america. four basal taxa from madagascar and indo/sri lanka are not monophyletic, and two  corresponding to etroplinae sensu sparks and smith  <cit>  form a sister group to all other cichlids. the other two malagasy taxa , corresponding to ptychochrominae sensu sparks and smith  <cit> , form a sister group to the african + neotropical clade. these results are consistent with previous molecular studies that used a few mitochondrial or nuclear gene sequences  <cit> , as well as morphological studies  <cit> .

however, these previous studies did not fully evaluate the statistical significance in rejecting alternative hypotheses of cichlid relationships. we conducted kh and sh tests, as well as a test using bayes factor. based on these tests, alternative hypotheses assuming the monophyly of malagasy + indo/sri lankan cichlids , old world cichlids , and african + indo/sri lankan cichlids  are all very unlikely . these results provide statistical support for the paraphyletic assemblage of the malagasy + indo/sri lankan taxa to the african + neotropical clade.

probabilities for constrained trees were assessed using the kishino-hasegawa  and shimodaira-hasegawa  tests and the bayes factor. single asterisks indicate significant rejection  and double asterisks indicate highly significant rejection  of the corresponding hypothesis. we used the traditional criterion of  <dig> ln bayes factor over  <dig> , indicating very strong evidence against an alternative hypothesis  <cit> . constrained trees are the following: tree 1: ), tylochromis polylepis),),,)); tree 2: ), tylochromis polylepis),,)),); and tree 3: ), tylochromis polylepis), etroplus maculatus),,)), paretroplus maculatus).

if cichlidae originated in cenozoic africa and migrated into south america, madagascar, and india via saltwater dispersal  <cit> , malagasy/indo sri lankan and/or neotropical taxa would probably be nested in the african clade, and alternative relationships  would likely appear. however, these relationships were not found, thus supporting the vicariant divergence scenario  <cit> , at least from a topological standpoint.

timing of cichlid divergences
we conducted divergence time estimation among  <dig> bony fishes, including  <dig> cichlids . twenty-one time constraints based on extensive fossil evidence for bony fishes  were used. following the advice of benton and donoghue  <cit>  to set fossil-based time constraints as hard lower boundaries and soft upper boundaries, we chose older values for upper boundaries. we estimated the divergence between african + neotropical cichlids and malagasy + indo/sri lankan  cichlids to be approximately  <dig> mya . the divergences of african vs. neotropical cichlids and malagasy vs. indo/sri lankan cichlids within the etroplinae were estimated to be approximately  <dig> mya  and  <dig> mya , respectively.

we then compared the estimated divergence times among cichlids and the probable times of continental fragmentation based on geological evidence. the divergence time between malagasy and indo/sri lankan taxa within etroplinae  is very close to the time of separation between madagascar and india   <cit> . the divergence time estimated between african and neotropical clades  is also close to the time of separation between african and south american landmasses   <cit> . the divergence time between african + neotropical cichlids and malagasy ptychochrominae cichlids  appears to be somewhat more recent than the time generally accepted for the complete separation of the indo-madagascar landmass from gondwanaland   <cit> . however, some studies  <cit>  have postulated an extended connection between india and antarctica by approximately  <dig> mya, which is within the 95% credibility range for the african/neotropical vs. ptychochrominae cichlid divergence. taken together, these results are consistent with the vicariant divergence of continental cichlid groups during cretaceous times and argue against their cenozoic dispersal.

vences et al.  <cit>  calibrated a molecular clock for cichlids that assumed that the divergence time of the most basal endemic lineages in east african rift lakes  corresponds to the geological estimate of the age of the lakes. these estimated divergence times between continental cichlid clades were all in the cenozoic  and supported the hypothesis of long-distance cenozoic transmarine dispersal of cichlids. this view of the cenozoic  origin and transmarine dispersal of cichlids has also been supported by some biogeographers  <cit>  because it is consistent with cichlid fossil records, which first occur in south america and africa in the eocene  <cit> . however, the clock-based dating procedures of vences et al.  <cit>  present some problems. the strict molecular clock may not hold for all cichlid lineages  <cit> , and the premise that the oldest endemic cichlid divergence is synchronized with the formation of the lakes may not be valid. some lineages that had diverged outside the lake may have immigrated in parallel  <cit> . in addition, there is no definitive, geologically based time estimate for the formation of the lakes.

more recently, genner et al.  <cit>  used two mitochondrial  and one nuclear  gene fragments to estimate the divergence times among cichlids. when the cichlid divergence by gondwanan vicariance was assumed, the resultant divergence times were more consistent with those estimated with time constraints from previous paleontological and molecular studies  <cit>  than when the cenozoic cichlid divergence was assumed based on fossil records.

although we concur on the gondwanan origin and vicariant divergence of cichlids, genner et al.  <cit>  evaluated this biogeographic hypothesis somewhat indirectly, in that the fitness of estimated times of cichlid divergences to those obtained with time constraints from previous studies was qualitatively compared between alternative assumptions on cichlid biogeography. we evaluated cichlid divergence times more directly by using longer mitogenomic sequence data and dozens of non-cichlid taxa, allowing us to set many time constraints purely from the paleontological data and providing additional evidence for an ancient cichlid divergence on gondwanaland, despite the general paucity of the mesozoic and cenozoic paleontological record on bony fishes.

gondwana fragmentation as time constraints
in figure  <dig>  minimum time constraints based on fossil records  are plotted against molecular time estimates of the corresponding divergences . in this figure, minimum age estimates of gondwanan fragmentations are also plotted against the corresponding molecular time estimates of continental cichlid groups. it should be noted here that the latter data points reflecting gondwanan fragmentation history  are plotted well on the line of 1: <dig> relationship whereas most of the data points reflecting fossil records  are considerably below the line of the 1: <dig> relationship. this pattern suggests that gondwana fragmentation history that is congruent with the cichlid phylogeny can be effective time constraints better than most of the mesozoic and cenozoic fossil records used here.

among the fossil data points, four data points in the paleozoic show a fairly good 1: <dig> relationship, whereas other points mostly in the mesozoic are considerably below the line of 1: <dig> relationship. this might mean that the mesozoic fossils do not really represent the oldest fossil for the corresponding lineages whereas this is not the case for older paleozoic lineages. this situation is somewhat reminiscent of the apparent relative paucity of mesozoic fossil evidence of tetrapods   <cit> .

several papers have noticed that molecular time estimations are consistently older than paleontological ones  <cit> . benton and ayala  <cit>  have pointed out four pervasive biases that make molecular dates too old: i) too old calibration dates based on previous molecular studies; ii) undetected fast-evolving genes; iii) ancestral polymorphism that is maintained through long evolutionary period; and iv) asymmetric distributions of estimated times, with a constrained younger end but an unconstrained older end .

the first factor is not the case for the present study, because we did not use the calibration dates based on previous molecular studies, but used only those based on fossil records. the third factor would be the case when the used genomic regions are under the long-term balancing selection, but no mitochondrial gene has been reported to be under such selection. regarding the second and fourth factors, we believe that they are also not the case for this study, because we used mitogenomic sequence data excluding peculiarly rapid evolving region , and because each mitochondrial gene used here was tested to perform well for dating vertebrate  divergences  <cit> . according to benton and ayala  <cit> , for reliable dating "careful choice of genes may be a more appropriate strategy , with a focus on long and fast-evolving  sequences." our present study based on nearly whole mitogenomic sequence data fairly accommodates such condition.

improved dating of teleostean divergences
we then conducted the divergence time estimation using the gondwanan vicariance assumption regarding cichlids as additional time constraints . compared to the results shown in figure  <dig> , the means of estimated divergence times at various nodes are similar or somewhat larger . however, the 95% credibility ranges of the estimated times overlap well between the two results, and the differences in mean values are not large, compared to potential error ranges in other elements, such as stochastic errors in molecular evolution and errors in dating fossils.

the addition of the cichlid constraints appears to shorten the 95% credibility intervals of the time estimates, especially for divergences occurring within acanthomorpha 100– <dig> mya. for example, our figure  <dig> and yamanoue et al.  <cit>  estimated the divergence time of torafugu  and medaka  to be approximately  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  mya, respectively. the cichlid constraints considerably narrowed the 95% credibility interval to  <dig>  mya , and also increased the precision of time estimates for other nodes. the use of ample molecular data from mitogenomic sequences also helped to narrow the credibility interval. for example, kumazawa et al.  <cit>  used two mitochondrial genes  and estimated the divergence between torafugu and zebrafish at  <dig> ±  <dig>  mya, whereas our whole mitogenomic data set showed the divergence at  <dig>  mya .

CONCLUSIONS
we estimated the divergence times of major cichlid lineages as part of the longer evolutionary history of teleostean fishes. our results and those of a recent molecular study based on both mitochondrial and nuclear data sets  <cit>  support a vicariant history of cichlid divergences, while other researchers  <cit>  have argued for the dispersal hypothesis. we presented additional strong evidence for the vicariant hypothesis and propose that the vicariant assumption can be used to generate time constraints to date other teleostean divergences in both deeper  and shallower  time ranges.

this could be a significant contribution toward the reliable dating of teleostean divergence times in light of the scarcity of teleostean fossil records in the mesozoic and later  and the probable deviation of molecular evolutionary rates of fishes from those of tetrapods  <cit> , for which molecular evolutionary rates are more reliably studied using ampler fossil records. a further exploration of biogeography-based time constraints for other groups of freshwater fishes that could be reasonably incorporated into the dating study  would be expected to increase the accuracy and precision of teleostean divergence time estimates.
