BACKGROUND
fungi constitute one of the most diverse kingdoms of living organisms including various forms and ecological roles such as decomposers, mutualists or parasitical symbionts. their importance for industrial and agricultural applications and their experimental tractability made them useful and popular model for studying cell biology and functional genomics in various biological context. in this regard, the number of whole-genome sequence data from a wide variety of fungi has dramatically increased during the last decade  <cit> .

entomopathogenic fungi  are also receiving growing attention with regard to the development of genomic resources. on one hand, m. anisopliae s.l.  and b. bassiana s.l., which are widely used as agents for biological control have instigated the development of genomic resources and experimental approaches in order to study virulence and pathogenicity  <cit> . on the other hand, other species such as o. sinensis and c. militaris are widely used in asia as traditional chinese medicine and has therefore spurred interests for studying novel biosynthetic pathway and sexual reproduction through genomic approaches  <cit> . insect fungi are also well known for the production of interesting secondary metabolites such as polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides whereas the synthetic pathways have not yet been all elucidated  <cit> .

in this study, we report a draft genome of o. polyrachis-furcata, a species in the o. unilateralis species complex, which is also a hypocrealean entomopathogenic fungus. this species is outstanding for its ecological strategy as it modifies host ants’ behavior in order to favor its own dispersion   <cit> . the biology of o. unilateralis still has much to be discovered. the pathogenesis and molecular basis to pathogenicity are poorly known while the molecular basis of behavior manipulation is a total black box. the genome sequencing of this species will provide a basis for further exploration on these issues.

additionally, this fungus also differs from those previously cited regarding its host range. while m. anisopliae  and b. bassiana have very broad host ranges infecting several insect orders and could live as plant endophytes and in the soil, o. sinensis, c. militaris and o. unilateralis have narrower host ranges including various lepidopteran families for c. militaris  <cit> , a family of lepidoptera  for o. sinensis  <cit> , and only a tribe  in a sub-family of ants  for o. unilateralis  <cit> . previous studies showed hidden diversity of o. unilateralis associated to ant species, suggesting a diversification through host specificity  <cit> . a recent study suggested that o. unilateralis in thailand should be subdivided into three distinct species  according to the host species  <cit> . in this study, we focused on sequencing o. polyrhachis-furcata and analyzing its genes that were previously reported to be important to different steps of pathogenesis and thus virulence in other insect fungi and fungal pathogens. through comparative genomics between our fungus and nineteen other fungi including other entomopathogenic fungi , some fungal plant pathogens , opportunistic human pathogenic fungi and yeast , a fungal pathogen of amphibian  and saprophytic fungi  as well as a non-pathogenic yeast ; we identified genes involved in various steps of pathogenesis, investigated the common attributes of being entomopathogenic and the extent to which the host ranges have shaped their evolution as well as enable the discovery of new biosynthetic pathways.

RESULTS
general genome features
the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata  was sequenced in-house using the roche  <dig> gs flx system. this resulted in  <dig>  gb of sequence data  with average read length of 652 bp. the shotgun reads were de novo assembled resulting in  <dig> contigs. for sequence scaffolding, a dna library of 3 kb, 6 kb, and 8 kb inserts were constructed and sent to macrogen  for sequencing on hiseq <dig> platform .  <dig> contigs together with the mate-pair libraries were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds  with a total estimated genome size of about 43 mb. the assembled genome has been deposited as an ncbi’s whole genome shotgun  project under accession number lkcn <dig> and the data of the sequenced samples deposited at the ncbi’s biosample database under the accession number samn <dig> 

while having an equivalent genome size to other insect fungi , the genome of o. polyrhachis-fucata bcc <dig> was predicted to have  <dig> protein coding genes. this number is close to that of protein coding genes reported in  <cit>  for o. sinensis and substantially less than those reported for m. robertsii, m. acridum, b. bassiana, and c. militaris which have broader host ranges. furthermore, the number of secreted proteins as predicted by signalp  <dig>   <cit>  is less than half of those four entomopathogenic genomes . this number is reliable as the assembled genome was assessed to be as complete as 96 % ,  <dig>  % fragmented, and only  <dig>  % missing. the set of annotated protein coding genes was assessed to be 95 % complete ,  <dig>  % fragmented, and only  <dig>  % missing.table  <dig> comparison of genome features among six entomopathogenic fungi

pathogen-host interaction genes
the potential virulence-associated genes in the o. polyrhachis-furcata and nineteen other genomes were identified by blast analysis against the pathogen-host interaction  database  <cit> . this is a useful database synthesizing a plethora of experimentally verified genes related to the mediation of fungal pathogens, including oomycetes, to cause disease and to provoke response from the hosts . we identified  <dig> putative phi genes in o. polyrhachis-furcata, which is remarkably lower than in other insect fungi with broader host ranges . the six species of entomopathogenic fungi were clustered together according to the number of specific phi genes, shown to be related to pathogenicity, which were identified across all the genomes used for the analysis . particularly, o. polyrhachis-furcata was the closest to o. sinensis. also, the plant pathogens appeared close in terms of phi genes abundance while yeasts , saprophytic mushroom  and the amphibian pathogen  share similar patterns of phi genes abundance .fig.  <dig> a phylogram based on the number of genes in all phi families with presence/absence of some selected families. opf = ophiocordyceps polyrhachis-furcata, opsine = ophiocordyceps sinensis, beubas = beauveria bassiana, cormil = cordyceps militaris, metani = metarhizium anisopliae, metrob = metarhizium robertsii, fusgra = fusarium graminearum, veralb = verticillium alfalfae, sclscl = sclerotinia sclerotiorum, botfw = botryotinia fuckeliana, asnia = aspergillus nidulans, asf = aspergillus fumigatus, sacces = saccharomyces cerevisiae, canalb = candida albicans, schipo = schizosaccharomyces pombe, copcin = coprinosis cinerea, ustmay = ustilago maydis, batd = batrachochytrium dendrobatidis




although o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis have generally less phi genes compared with the other insect fungi, some phi gene families were specifically found or in higher numbers in these two fungi. interestingly, o. polyrhachis-furcata contains more phi: <dig> genes , compared with other five entomopathogenic fungi . this class of genes was reported as virulence gene in the rice blast fungus, m. grisea  <cit> . among the twenty genomes, all except o. polyrhachis-furcata and m. grisea, contain at most two phi: <dig> genes. among the six entomopathogenic fungi, phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  phi: <dig> and phi: <dig> genes were found only in o. polyrhachis-furcata. phi: <dig> was also reported in m. grisea. its disruption caused the loss of pathogenicity against rice  <cit> . phi: <dig> was characterized in mycosphaerella graminicola as resistance to azole fungicides  <cit> . the gene deletion of phi: <dig> resulted in reduced virulence of s. sclerotiorum and oxidative burst in adjacent uninfected cells of tomato   <cit> . the disruption of phi: <dig> gene in claviceps purpurea t <dig> reduced virulence against rye  <cit>  while the disruption of phi: <dig>  phi: <dig> in gibberella zeae did not affect pathogenicity  <cit> . o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis contain phi: <dig>  <cit> , phi: <dig>  <cit> , phi: <dig>  <cit> , phi: <dig>  <cit>  and phi: <dig>  <cit>  genes, which are missing from the other four entomopathogenic fungi. the deletion of all of these genes except phi: <dig> resulted in reduced-virulence phenotypes in other fungal pathogens. for example, the lethality effect on a. fumigatus af <dig> comes from the double mutant of phi: <dig>  while each individual deletion can compensate the loss of the other  <cit> .

b. bassiana contain more copies of phi: <dig> , phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  phi: <dig> , compared to other five entomopathogenic fungi . interestingly, phi: <dig> in xanthomonas oryzae is a plant avirulence determinant  <cit> . the mutant phenotype of other three phi genes is resistant to chemical fungicides .

another interesting phi genes set consists of phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  phi: <dig>  and phi: <dig> as o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis have less number of these phi genes compared to other four entomopathogenic fungi. phi: <dig> was reported as a plasma membrane-localized sucrose transporter ; a fungal virulence factor, characterized from corn smut fungus u. maydis  <cit> . phi: <dig> has not been reported to affect pathogenicity while phi: <dig> was reported as a virulence gene in m. grisea  <cit> . finally, phi: <dig> was reported as involving in drug sensitivity and virulence in c. albicans  <cit>  .

surface adhesion genes
the first step to cause disease is the attachment of the infective propagules on the hosts’surface. this involves hydrophobic interactions between the spore surface proteins  and the lipid layer on the epicuticle of insects. hydrophobins can be classified into two classes based on their hydropathy and solubility characteristics  <cit> . in insect fungi, hydrophobins were previously shown to be involved in the formation of appressorium in m. anisopliae  <cit>  and b. bassiana  <cit>  as well as virulence factors in m. brunneum  <cit> . only class  <dig> hydrophobins, which are represented by the orthologous proteins maa_ <dig> and mac_ <dig> in m. robertsii and m. acridum respectively, were identified in the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata. the genomes of the three other entomopathogenic fungi also contain this class of hydrophobins. in addition, six other species  have orthologous proteins of this class. notably, the protein bba_ <dig> of b. bassiana, which is annotated as hydrophobin-like protein at uniprot, was clustered to the same orthologous group of the class  <dig> hydrophobins of the other entomopathogenic fungi while the annotated hydrophobin  <dig> of this species  could not be clustered with the other species. the gene product of hyd <dig> was reported as the major component of the b. bassiana rodlet layer  <cit> . in contrast, no orthologous class  <dig> hydrophobin was identified in o. polyrhachis-furcata. the class  <dig> hydrophobins maa_ <dig> and mac_ <dig>  reported in  <cit> , and bba_ <dig>  reported in  <cit> , were identified in c. militaris and o. sinensis as well as in eight other species, including a. fumigatus, a. nidulans, b. fuckeliana , c. cinerea , gibberella zeae/f. graminearum , m. oryzae, s. sclerotiorum, u. maydis.

beside hydrophobins, the mad <dig> adhesin , characterized previously in m. robertsii, also provides adhesion specifically to insect host surfaces, enhances the expression of genes related to i.e., germination, blastospore formation, and thus affects virulence to caterpillars  <cit> . o. polyrhachis-furcata as well as all other eighteen species have multiple orthologous proteins of this adhesin. the mad <dig> adhesin  allows adhesion of m. robertsii to plant surfaces  <cit>  but has no effects on fungal differentiation and entomopathogenicity. interestingly, only six genomes, the v. alfalfae genome together with five other from entomopathogenic fungi, excluding o. sinensis have a single copy of mad <dig> adhesin ortholog.

insect cuticle degrading genes
insect pathogens are expected to secrete large number of enzymes for degrading insect cuticle. these include various proteinases, particularly subtilisins, and other enzymes susceptible to degrade molecules present on the insects’ cuticles . o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis contain similar numbers of subtilisins, trypsins, and aspartyl proteases which are much smaller than those of other four entomopathogenic fungi . in m. anisopliae s.l., subtilisins were reported to degrade host cuticles and allow acquiring nutrients, with potential functional differences between subfamilies in secondary substrate specificities and adsorption properties  <cit> . o. polyrhachis-furcata, o. sinensis and c. militaris contain about half the number of subtilisins  compared with b. bassiana, m. robertsii, and m. acridum. eleven out of twenty-three subfamilies of subtilisins, were not identified in any of the six entomopathogenic species while four are common across all six species . among those that were commonly found in the six insect fungi, subfamily s <dig> upa  is very abundant.fig.  <dig> expansions of proteases among six entomopathogenic fungi including o. polyrhachis-furcata. a the distribution of proteases families among the six entomopathogenic fungi included in this study. b a maximum likelihood-based unrooted phylogenetic tree illustrating the relation between orthologous proteins of subtilisins . c a maximum likelihood-based unrooted phylogenetic tree illustrating the relation between orthologous proteins of aspatyl proteases . the sequences labels; colored following insect fungi species: red = o. polyrhachis-furcata , brown = b. bassiana , green = m. robertsii , dark blue = m. acridum , light blue = c. militaris , pink = o. sinensis ; are written in the form of cluster id._fungal species_sequences id. the cluster identities were obtained inferred according to inparanoid/quickparanoid  <cit> 



regarding the subtilisins s <dig> , four out of five subfamilies could be identified in entomopathogenic fungi. o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis contain only one protease in the subfamily s <dig> upw , which is common across the six entomopathogenic fungi. four other entomopathogenic species contain a few more proteinases, including aorsin  and grifolisin  with one additional scytalidolisin  for c. militaris, which were not found in o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis. the subfamily s <dig>   was not identified in any six species.

the subtilisins  of o. polyrhachis-furcata derived from those of other entomopathogenic fungi do not form a monophyletic clade , indicating that they have evolved independently from the subtilisins of other entomopathagenic fungi. five of them  could not be assigned to any orthologous group with any other fungi. these proteins were respectively annotated as s <dig>   , s <dig> upa  , s <dig>   , s <dig>   , and s <dig>   . however, it is to be noted that orthologous groups of subtilisins inferred by inparanoid/quickparanoids  <cit>  are not supported by the maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic inference , suggesting that the similarity-based method of inparanoid/quickparanoid should be taken with caution.

both o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis contain only one trypsin s <dig> upb , which is conserved across six entomopathogenic fungi. other insect fungi species have substantially higher number of trypsins . subfamily s <dig> upa  was identified in all but the two ophiocordyceps and the most abundant family. subfamily s <dig>   was identified in b. bassiana , c. militaris  and m. robertsii  but not in m. acridum. additionally, only b. bassiana contains additional two nma <dig> peptidases .

the numbers of aspartyl proteases  identified in o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis are about half of the other four entomopathogenic fungi and in only four out of thirty-five subfamilies. subfamily a <dig> upa  is conserved across the six species and very abundant. twenty-two out of thirty-five subfamilies were not identified in any six species. subfamilies a <dig>   and a <dig>   were found in all but the two ophiocordyceps species. several subfamilies a <dig>  , a <dig>  , a <dig>  , a <dig>  , and a <dig> upb  were identified in only the two metarhizium species. additionally, a <dig>   was identified in all except o. sinensis . like subtilisins s <dig> and s <dig>  the aspatryl proteases of o. polyrhachis-furcata do not form a monophyletic clade .

like proteases, chitinases have been reported as involved in host penetration which is a crucial first step of pathogenesis and to influence the virulence . the chitinases are classified into a family of glycoside hydrolase . gh <dig> is the most abundant family of glycoside hydrolase found in all fungi included in our analysis . among entomopathogenic fungi, broad host-range species including b. bassiana and m. robertsii also possess more genes encoding this gh family  than m. acridum , c. militaris , o. sinensis  and also o. polyrhachis-furcata . additionnally, o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis have less proteins of several gh families than the other four entomopathogenic fungi . some gh, and polysaccharide lyase families were reported to be related to host-specific adaptation in plant pathogens . all six entomopathogenic fungi do not have the gh <dig> families, less than half of the numbers of gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> , and many less or no pl <dig> and pl <dig> . among these families; gh <dig>  gh <dig> showed the same tendency as that found for gh <dig> in that broad host-range species possess more genes than narrow host-range species including o. polyrhachis-furcata. regarding the families of carbohydrate esterases , on one hand, o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis have less number of ce for the families ce <dig> and ce <dig>  compared to the other four entomopathogenic fungi species. on the other hand, they contain similar number of proteins to the other insect fungi but different to plant pathogens for the ce <dig>  ce <dig> and ce <dig> families .

bacterial-like toxins
entomopathogenic fungi are expected to infect hosts through cuticular penetration and thus to possess less toxins compared with other pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. however, the number of bacterial-like toxin proteins and toxin-biosynthesis proteins found in o. polyrhachis-furcata are relatively high , compared to c. militaris , m. robertsii , m. acridum  and o. sinensis ; this number is actually the same as b. bassiana  <cit>  . m. robertsii has the highest number of such proteins . seventeen out of twenty-two toxins found in the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata are heat-labile enterotoxins a chain. others include a zeta toxin, a ribotoxin, two cholera entorotoxins and a killer toxin. among these toxins, a gene putatively encoding a heat-labile a chain was identified in front of a nrps gene in a predicted nrps gene cluster. the prevalence of genes coding for bacterial-like toxins in the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata suggests the possibility of oral toxicity as a mode of killing insect host.

signal transduction
the encounter between the pathogens and the hosts will inevitably engage the signal transduction from both parties. we also found in the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata various genes related to cellular signal transduction including g proteins, g protein-coupled receptors  and histidine kinases .

among six entomopathogenic fungi, o. polyrhachis-furcata contains the smallest number of pth11-like g-protein coupled receptors  which are cell-surface integral membrane proteins required for pathogenicity  <cit> . also, as phi genes , they mediate cell response to inductive cues  <cit> . phi genes were shown to be related to host specificity of m. acridum via differential expression on locust and cockroach cuticles  <cit> . all other fourteen non-entomopathogenic fungi clearly contain less number of pth11-like genes.

two phi: <dig> proteins in o. polyrhachis-furcata out of seven, opf_ <dig>  and opf_ <dig> , have no orthologs with any other nineteen compared species. based on blastx against nr database, the two proteins were annotated as “hypothetical protein thite_2110904” and “putative integral membrane protein ”. meanwhile, six putative phi: <dig> genes were found in o. polyrhachis-furcata and could be clustered into orthologous groups with the other fungi.

g protein alpha subunits have been comprehensively studied, as a key component of signal transduction pathways and pathogenicity  <cit> . its disruption in stagonospora nodorum made the fungus less pathogenic, unable to sporulate, and albino phenotype with secretion of brown pigments into growth media  <cit> . in metarhizium, g-alpha proteins in m. robertsii  and m. acridum  were observed as the most expressed g-alpha genes during their infection of either cockroach or locust cuticles  <cit> . these two genes are clustered together as orthologous proteins with all remaining eighteen species including o. polyrhachis-furcata: opf_ <dig>  the two-component histidine kinase  signaling pathways mediate environmental stress responses and regulation of secondary metabolism  <cit> , response to bacterial metabolites  <cit> , hyphal development  <cit> , virulence  <cit>  and sensitivity to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides  <cit>  in diverse fungal species. o. polyrhachis-furcata contains the similar number of histidine kinases  compared with m. robertsii  and m. acridum  reported in  <cit> .

core genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites
insect fungi are also well known for producing a variety of secondary metabolites. genes implicated in their biosynthesis have received large attention, particularly polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides synthetases   <cit> . based on smurf  <cit> , the o. polyrhachis-furcata genome encodes  <dig> putative nrps, other  <dig> nrps-like,  <dig> pks,  <dig> pks-like,  <dig> nrps-pks hybrid and without dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase  genes . the total number of  <dig> core genes in this species is much less than that of m. robertsii  and m. acridum   <cit>  and somewhat less than that of b. bassiana   <cit>  and also c. militaris   <cit> . similar to m. robertsii, one of the four putative nrps-like genes in o. polyrhachis-furcata is an antibiotic synthetase, reported for preserving the cadaver from microbial competitors  <cit> . another nrps-like protein  is mostly similar to another antibiotics synthase . the unique pks/nrps hybrid gene gets the top hit to fusarin c cluster-polyketide synthase/nrps, which is a mycotoxin produced by several fusarium species with carcinogenic effects  <cit> . beside these core genes, three additional genes , reported to be responsible for fusarin production  <cit> , were also identified within this hybrid cluster. o. polyrhachis-furcata possesses an nrps , which is similar  to peramine synthetase  of epichloe festucae, the essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of peramine; a compelling insect feeding deterrent to protect their grass host from insect herbivory  <cit> . based on antismash  <cit> , o. polyrhachis-furcata also possesses the pks-like and nrps-like which are respectively similar to ochratoxin a polyketide synthase  and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  of penicillium nordicum characterized in  <cit> . even located on the same scaffold, they are not on the same cluster.table  <dig> number of core genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites

repeat elements and transposases
on one hand, the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata comprises notably more class ii transposable elements  - the dna transposons including dna/hat , dna/mariner , dna/mudr , and dna/helitron  - compared with the genomes of c. militaris and m. acridum which contain less than five of these elements in their genomes. on the other hand, o. polyrhachis-furcata possess less of these elements compared to the genomes of b. bassiana and m. robertsii  except for dna/helitron of which b. bassiana is devoid. particularly, m. robertsii contains several more dna/helitron  compared with o. polyrhachis-furcata  and m. acridum  while c. militaris do not have this specific element. regarding the class i elements or the retroelements, the ltr/copia, ltr/gypsy, as well as the non-ltr/line are much more abundant in o. polyrhachis-furcata compared to those species. nevertheless, except for dna/hat and dna/helitron, o. sinensis contain many more transposable elements than the other insect fungi species studied here . transposases were reported to be expressed during infection in metarhizium  <cit> . therefore, this type of genomic mobile element may be related to pathogenicity.fig.  <dig> the numbers of transposases between the genomes of different entomopathogenic fungi. the data of o. sinensis  <cit>  were not included in this graphic as this species contain much higher numbers of most transposable elements classes  and skewed the representation



discussion
we present here a genome draft of an outstanding insect fungus, o. unilateralis s.l. from the host polyrhachis furcata. in our study, we compare this genome to other available fungal genomes of various origins in order to gain insights into the biology of this species. the particularity of this fungus is its extreme host-specificity as shown by the fact that different species are associated to different ant species  <cit> . here, we have sequenced o. polyrhachis-furcata which is specific to an ant species while, for the others, the degree of host range is variable, ranging from families of the same insect orders  to several insect orders .

we found that the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata contains various genes which were shown to be implicated during the pathogenesis of fungal pathogens. many of them are in common with other entomopathogenic fungi and fungal plant pathogens.

in this genome, we observed contractions of several kinds of genes, compared to broad host range entomopathogenic fungi. this signature of genes contraction is found for genes involved throughout the pathogenesis, from genes required for the adhesion of infective propagules to the synthesis of metabolites potentially necessary for coping with insect immune systems. this may have critical implications in the life of this fungus. for example, hydrophobins classes  <dig> and  <dig> are amphiphilic proteins, mostly involved in the mediation of the contact between the fungal cells and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces. although the roles of both classes and different paralogs are not yet totally elucidated and partially overlapping  <cit> , the disruption of a number of hydrophobins resulted in altered hydrophobicity of the mycelia as well as the morphology and production of conidia . the absence of hydrophobin class  <dig> in o. polyrhachis-furcata could be related to fastidious growth and sporulation of this species in standard complex media while b. bassiana, m. spp., c. militaris and o. sinensis are all fast growers and can produce spores abundantly in the laboratory.

comparison with extensive available fungal genomes allowed us to grasp common aspects and differences between plant and insect pathogens. a notable difference is the absence of mad <dig> adhesin in plant pathogens, which is not the case for the entomopathogenic fungi except o. sinensis. this suggests that the entomopathogenic fungi may have dual ways of life, being parasitic to insects and in the same time having the capacity to be endophytes in plants. this has already been shown in b. bassiana and m. anisopliae  <cit> . the absence of mad <dig> in plant pathogens suggests a totally different mechanism of adhesion. furthermore, notable differences in numbers of genes are found for various glycoside hydrolase , carbohydrate esterase  families as well as polysaccharide lyase  families. overall, the comparative analysis shows a cleavage between insect and plant pathogens in the penetration of host’s cell. this may be linked to the fact that fungal pathogens of plants need to overcome the cell wall which has different biochemical composition to insect cuticle.

subtilisin proteases have been shown to play crucial role in regulating the specificity to hosts of entomopathogenic fungi via the reduction of isoforms  <cit>  or the differential expressions of isoforms according to substrates  <cit> . hosts play important role in the evolution of subtilisin-like proteases in entomopathogenic fungi by imposing constraints into the realized niches in vivo. in metarhizium, generalist strains were shown to have more paralogous isoforms than a specialist strain  <cit> . according to our comparative analysis, there is also a tendency in the reduction of subtilisins proteases genes for narrow-host range species of insect fungi with o. polyrhachis-furcata having in effect the narrowest host range and one of the lowest numbers of genes coding for subtilisins proteases compared with the other entomopathogenic fungi. this is in accordance with the pattern of the reduction in genes number, found in gh and ce as well as in other genes coding for cuticle-degrading proteolytic enzymes like trypsin and aspatyl proteases, for narrow-host range species. this suggests a direct association between host range and diversity of cuticle-degrading enzymes. altogether, this consistently supports the early host recognition events as key to host specificity and the tendency toward reduced genes numbers associated with narrow host range.

referred to the phi genes classification, we observed also that o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis had substantially less genes for some families when compared to the other entomopathogenic fungi. one of these families is clearly related to the membrane transport of sucrose . the difference in number of genes for this family may result from the affinity to different nature of carbon sources in different insect hosts. another family of phi genes , which has different numbers of genes between o. polyrhachis-furcata/o. sinensis and the broad host range species, is involved in drug sensitivity. systemic immune response in different hosts may influence on the evolution of this family of genes in entomopathogenic fungi. other families of phi genes showing substantial reduction of gene numbers in o. polyrhachis-furcata are phi: <dig> and phi: <dig> which are also pth11-like g-protein coupled receptors  previously shown to be related to host specificity. o. polyrhachis-furcata has the lowest number of pth11-like genes compared to other five entomopathogenic fungi.

the genes contraction in these various families suggest that specific species like o. polyrhachis-furcata may have lost a plethora of proteins of these particular families which potentially cope with diverse systemic immune responses from unspecific host.

an unexpectedly high number of genes related to biosynthesis of bacterial-like toxins are found in the genome of o. polyrhachis-furcata, compared to other entomopathogenic fungi species considered as having narrow host range . previously, comparative genomics between generalist and specialist strains in m. anisopliae s.l.   <cit>  indicated that specialists had reductive evolution of genes involved in toxin biosynthesis, suggesting that they had lost the capacity to kill host rapidly and to exploit host saprotrophically. instead, they got specialized into strategies optimizing the struggle against host immune system and exploitation of living hosts. furthermore, our comparative analysis also supports this hypothesis regarding m. robertsii and m. acridum which differ in their host ranges and diversity of putative genes producing toxins. therefore, we expect o. polyrhachis -furcata which is an extreme specialist to have evolved into the latter strategy while the data support for the former. this suggests that o. unilateralis may have a totally different mechanism for killing host from that of m. anisopliae. toxins found in o. polyrhachis-furcata’s genome are for many enterotoxins, suggesting that oral toxicity may constitute a mode of killing for our fungus. however, how o. polyrhachis-furcata, as a species of o. unilateralis which is well documented for its extended phenotypes in manipulating the ant host, strives to compromise between rapid killing by toxin and slow killing enabling the host manipulation remains to be solved.

another distinctive feature of o. polyrhachis-furcata’s genome is the composition of transposable elements. the ltr/copia and ltr/gypsy are much more abundant in o. polyrhachis-furcata than in the other insect fungi except o. sinensis which has the highest numbers of transposable elements of almost all classes. it is well known that transposable elements are important source of genetic variability of different species and also contribute to intra-specific diversification in various fungi  <cit> . also, transposable elements were shown to have important roles in pathogenicity and virulence for many microorganisms. particularly, retrotransposons were shown be involved in the pathogenicity of c. albicans  <cit>  and associated with the rapid evolution of effectors and the adaptation to new host in other pathogenic filamentous fungi  <cit>  and oomycetes  <cit> . for insect fungi, it was shown that more than 65 % of the transposase genes were transcribed in metarhizium hyphae during the infection process  <cit> . therefore, the enrichment of retrotransposons in o. polyrhachis-furcata and o. sinensis could be related to their high host specificity and a unique pathogenicity compared to the other insect fungi. the evolution of host specificity and the diversification of insect fungi may thus be driven by the expansion/reduction of these elements.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequencing and annotation of fungal genomes have allowed mycologists to gain insight into the fundamental aspects of fungal and eukaryotic biology. comparative analyses between o. polyrhachis-furcata and some other fungi give unprecedented insights into the biology of this species, particularly regarding the emergence of its extreme host specificity. gene contractions have been postulated as being one of major causes in the evolution of host-specificity in various organisms. this is due to the fact that losses of genes are accompanied by losses of capacity of the organisms to exploit range of hosts. the contraction of various gene families in o. polyrhachis-furcata is in line with this hypothesis. however, this cannot alone explain the evolution of host specificity. specific genes and even genomic regions or chromosomes are also the origin of host specificity in many fungal pathogens. some genes found in o. polyrhachis-furcata are unique among entomopathogenic fungi. the contribution of these genes to the unique biology and host specificity of o. unilateralis s.l. remains to be studied. particularly, the expansions of genes related to the production of bacterial-like toxins and of retrotransposons are of major interests. while loss of toxins and capacity to kill hosts rapidly was proposed as on mechanism underlying host-specificity  <cit> , the pattern of expansion observed in o. polyrhachis-furcata suggest a completely different mechanism. also, the expansion of retrotransposons in this fungus is unique among insect fungi. these findings will pave a way to a better understanding of this unique organism and provide promising field of research.
