BACKGROUND
menaquinone, vitamin k <dig>  is a lipid soluble quinone used by bacteria for electron transport. it is the sole quinone available to gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  whereas gram-negative bacteria use ubiquinone under aerobic conditions, and menaquinone under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . vitamin k, as menaquinone or the plant form phylloquinone, is a cofactor for γ-carboxylation of glutamate, a post-translational modification of proteins involved in blood coagulation and vascular biology and is an essential component of the mammalian diet  <cit> .

there are two distinct biosynthetic routes to menaquinone. one, recently discovered, occurs in a small subset of bacteria such as helicobacter pylori  <cit> . the starting point is chorismate supplied by the shikimate pathway and the intermediates include the inosine derivative futalosine. the most prevalent, classical biosynthetic route to menaquinone, has been most studied in escherichia coli  <cit> . the starting point remains chorismate, which is isomerized to isochorismate then converted, in three enzyme-catalyzed stages, to o-succinyl-1-benzoate. two further reactions, involving atp and coa, lead to a coa-naphthalene derivative before a thioesterase  <cit>  removes the coa moiety to release  <dig> -dihydroxy-2-napthanoate. prenylation, with products from the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, and finally a methylation reaction completes the production of menaquinone.

to attain a comprehensive understanding of menaquinone biosynthesis, a fundamental aspect of bacterial metabolism, it is imperative to characterize the molecular structures and properties of the relevant enzymes. our research in this area is confined to the classical menaquinone biosynthetic route and we previously reported on menb  <cit>  and mend  <cit> . we turn our attention now to menh, the enzyme which catalyzes the third step in this pathway, a  <dig> -elimination of pyruvate from 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate  to produce 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy- <dig> -cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate .

there has been confusion about the reaction catalyzed by menh, in large part due to misassignment of the enzymatic activities of menb and mend. initial reports  <cit>  described mend as the enzyme that cleaved the pyruvate side chain from the isochorismate - α-ketoglutarate adduct sephchc. menb was assumed to cyclize and then cleave coa from a napthanyl derivative  <cit> , and the product encoded by the menh gene had no function assigned. it was subsequently proven that menb lacked such coa esterase activity and then postulated that menh could catalyze this reaction  <cit> . indeed, many databases still list menh as encoding a thioesterase. more recently, jiang et al.  <cit>  showed that mend is not a bifunctional enzyme but is sephchc synthase . structural and kinetic studies are compatible with this assignment  <cit> . rigorous biochemical analysis then proved that menh is actually responsible for the elimination of the pyruvate side chain  and that previous studies had been compromised by the inherent reactivity of sephchc, which slowly decomposes to shchc and pyruvate  <cit> .

we now describe the high-resolution crystal structure of staphylococcus aureus menh , compare it to the structure of the vibrio cholerae enzyme  deposited in the protein data bank  and discuss conserved residues with particular focus on what such residues contribute to the architecture of the active site. consideration of data derived from site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies of the e. coli enzyme   <cit>  allow us to reassess the molecular features that influence specificity and reactivity of menh and address two issues of the structure-mechanism relationship, which remain unclear. the assignment of an oxyanion-binding site formed by two amino acid side chains by jiang et al.  <cit>  is highly unusual and is revisited. finally the origin of the proton that converts a methylene group to a methyl  is considered and a proton-shuttle mechanism, involving transfer from substrate to protein then back at a different position is proposed.

RESULTS
general comments and overall structure
an efficient bacterial expression system for a histidine-tagged samenh was constructed and supplied material for structural studies. approximately  <dig> mg of protein was obtained from  <dig> l of e. coli culture. the enzyme crystallizes in the monoclinic space group c <dig> with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and diffraction data to better than  <dig> Å were measured in-house. the structure was solved by molecular replacement using a model based on pdb entry 1r3d, which although listed as a protein of unknown function from v. cholerae, has been identified as menh  <cit> . the sequence identity with samenh is about 20% and the best molecular replacement solution had a translational z-score of  <dig> , low for a correct solution. the initial electron and difference density maps were of poor quality but with defined features that suggested a correct molecular replacement solution had been obtained. analysis of molecular packing in the crystal lattice also engendered confidence in the solution therefore we proceeded with refinement. the maps gradually improved with rounds of careful model building and refinement. once all ordered menh residues were included in the model a search for water molecules, to be included in the refinement, was initiated. a conservative approach to water identification was adopted. the crystallographic statistics and model geometry indicate that the refinement has produced an acceptable high-resolution model . at the end of the refinement there was continuous electron density for the entire polypeptide chain, residues 1- <dig>  missing only the gly-his residues that remain at the n-terminus following proteolytic cleavage of the histidine tag.

approximately 65% of the samenh residues are in well-defined elements of secondary structure. these comprise  <dig> β-strands and  <dig> α-helices arranged in the α/β hydrolase fold  <cit> , a central β-sheet with a marked twist, sandwiched between α-helices . strand β <dig> is antiparallel to the others. helices α <dig> and α <dig> lie in the concave face of the β-sheet and α <dig> to α <dig> form an insertion in the canonical α/β hydrolase fold to create a domain that caps the active site. the interface between the cap and core domains, which involves  <dig> hydrogen bonds, occludes approximately 25% of the surface area of the cap domain itself .

members of the α/β hydrolase family display different oligomerization states. for example, the c-c bond hydrolase mphc is dimeric in both solution and crystalline states, with an extended β-sheet formed across the dimer interface  <cit>  whilst others such as acetylcholine esterase are monomeric  <cit> . samenh behaves as a monomer in solution, as indicated by size-exclusion chromatography . analysis of the crystal structure using the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies server  <cit>  indicated no significant areas of interaction to suggest oligomerization of menh in the crystalline state .

comparisons with related structures
there are over  <dig> structures known for α/β hydrolase family members and they encompass a wide range of differing functions such as esterases, hydrolases, lipases, haloperoxidases and peptidases  <cit> . the fold is tolerant to insertions, with proteins ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues in length. the canonical α/β hydrolase structure contains a core composed of eight β-strands  <cit> . however, in samenh the core β-sheet consists of only seven strands due to the absence of the n-terminal strand observed in other family members. a common insertion in the canonical α/β hydrolase fold is a lid, or cap domain over the active site. in samenh the cap is formed by five helices, α <dig> to α <dig> . the cap domain is important in defining the active site size and aspects of substrate specificity as will be described. in some structures the cap domain appears to be flexible as indicated by higher temperature factors. however, this is not the case in samenh  where we see no correlation between the selected translation-libration-screw  domains and the cap/core domains. this observation should be treated with caution since the samenh crystals contain a relatively low volume of bulk solvent  and the molecular packing in the crystal lattice involves direct interactions of residues in the cap domain with three symmetry related molecules. the tight packing may therefore artificially restrict flexibility of the cap domain with respect to the core of the structure.

analysis using secondary structure matching  <cit>  indicates that, as expected, samenh is similar to various α/β hydrolases. however, with the exception of vcmenh, there are no particularly close matches in the pdb. the structural homologues include haem-independent haloperoxidases, various esterases and hydrolases that overlay with samenh with root-mean-squared deviation  values in the range  <dig> - <dig>  Å, all with approximately  <dig> aligned cα atoms and sequence identities around 20%. similar results have been reported in structural comparisons of the α/β hydrolases, for example in an investigation of the carboxylesterase bioh from e. coli  <cit> . of note is the rv <dig> protein from mycobacterium tuberculosis recently investigated as a potential menh orthologue, which falls within the range observed for the other α/β-hydrolases  and has no activity with sephchc  <cit> .

a closer alignment is observed when comparing samenh with vcmenh, proteins which share 21% sequence identity. the r.m.s.d. is  <dig>  Å for least-squares fit of  <dig> cα atoms . the loop linking β <dig> and α <dig>  a region of high sequence variability in menh orthologues , is not modelled in the structure of vcmenh but is ordered in samenh. the largest difference between the two structures is in the orientation of the n-terminal region of β <dig>  part of the lid domain, where cα positions differ by up to  <dig> Å . this overlay highlights similarities in and around the active site that are likely important for enzyme activity and will be mentioned in the next section.

the architecture of the menh active site and recognition of substrate
the residues that form the samenh catalytic triad, ser <dig>  asp <dig> and his <dig> are positioned on one side of a water-filled tunnel formed between the cap and core domains . the residues that contribute to the active site are contributed from α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  two turns between β2-α <dig> and β4-α <dig> respectively and the loops that follow β <dig> and β <dig> . the entrance to the active site is near arg <dig> and the tunnel then extends around and over the catalytic center to asn <dig>  a distance of about  <dig> Å . a complex network of hydrogen bonds, involving well ordered water molecules, serve to organize the residues around the active site. the electrostatic properties complement the negatively charged substrate, which carries three carboxylate groups, at positions c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and a hydrophobic component . a cavity is formed to the side of this tunnel near phe <dig>  adjacent to the catalytic machinery .

as is typical of the α/β hydrolase fold, the catalytic serine  occurs in a gxsxg motif  located on a tight turn, often termed the 'nucleophile elbow', between a central β-strand and a helix. the two glycine residues help create the tight turn, which is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond formed between the main chain carbonyl of ser <dig> and amide nitrogen of gly <dig> . asp <dig> is located on a second tight turn, between β <dig> and α <dig>  and is shielded from the active site by leu <dig> and phe <dig>  the hydrogen bonding interaction between asp <dig> and his <dig>  helps to position the imidazole to interact with the hydroxyl of ser <dig> in the apo-structure. ser <dig> og also accepts a hydrogen bond donated from a particularly well-ordered water molecule , which in turn accepts two hydrogen bonds from the main chain amides of phe <dig> and met <dig> 

the active site has a pronounced hydrophobic patch created by trp <dig>  phe <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig> and phe <dig>  and in addition phe <dig> and leu <dig>  help form the base of the site . the position of trp <dig> is determined by van der waals interactions with phe <dig> and phe <dig>  on one side of the indole, phe <dig> on the other side and the side chain of arg <dig> abuts cz <dig>  this orientation of the trp <dig> side chain places ne <dig> directed towards the active site to form a hydrogen bond with an ordered water molecule  that contributes to forming a network of solvent molecules in the active site. phe <dig>  leu <dig> and phe <dig> provide a hydrophobic environment around the side chain of his <dig> helping to hold it in place and providing a microenvironment that may increase the pka.

the side chain of tyr <dig> is positioned by van der waals interactions with gly <dig> cα, ser <dig> cβ, glu <dig> cd and his <dig> ce <dig>  his <dig> is held in place by hydrogen bonds formed between nd <dig> and ne <dig> with glu <dig> oe <dig> and thr <dig> og <dig> respectively . as a result, tyr <dig> oh is placed to participate in hydrogen bonds with thr <dig> og <dig> and an ordered water molecule, . a distance of  <dig>  Å separates his <dig> cd <dig> from tyr <dig> oh and the geometry is compatible with the presence of a c-h•••o hydrogen bond   <cit> . the c-h•••o hydrogen bond is a weak interaction but may contribute stability to the positive-charge distribution on the protonated histidine and in so doing support a catalytic function. such a role has been invoked in enzymes such as trypanothione reductase, which is dependent on proton transfer from histidine  <cit> .

there are six basic residues in the active site  and a single acidic residue, asp <dig> . lys <dig> is on the periphery of the active site with the aliphatic component of the side chain lying on the side chain of phe <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  together with asp <dig> are opposite lys <dig>  arg <dig> forms both a direct and a water-mediated hydrogen-bonding association with asp <dig>  which also accepts a hydrogen bond from arg <dig>  the water that bridges arg <dig> and asp <dig>  wat <dig>  accepts a hydrogen bond donated by the amide of thr <dig>  arg <dig> is held in place by forming a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of tyr <dig> and to two water molecules in the active site, wat <dig>  and wat <dig> . arg <dig> is about  <dig> Å from the catalytic center lining the polar tunnel formed at the interface of the cap and core domains. arg <dig> nh <dig> donates a hydrogen bond to gln <dig> oe <dig> and to four water molecules, two of which are shown in figure  <dig> 

the overall sequence identity between menh proteins is relatively low and a comparison highlights key residues in and around the active site . of  <dig> orthologues in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> ,  <dig> are unique when filtered at a 90% sequence identity level. within these sequences,  <dig> residues are conserved in at least 90% of them. the catalytic triad is conserved in all but one sequence where aspartate is replaced by glutamate. eight of the remaining strictly conserved residues are glycine, which are all located at the end of secondary structure elements or in loops and may be important in defining the overall structure, for example in the "elbow" motif in the active site. the acidic asp <dig>  five of the nine hydrophobic residues and five out of the six basic residues listed above as contributing to the architecture of the active site are strictly conserved. three of the hydrophobic residues, met <dig>  phe <dig>  leu <dig> are replaced by valines or leucine. arg <dig> is not a highly conserved residue, being substituted by trp <dig> in ecmenh for example .

the structural overlay of samenh and vcmenh, discussed above, indicates that the conserved residues in the active site adopt similar orientations and only the side chain of arg <dig>  differs significantly . in samenh, arg <dig> is oriented towards α <dig>  in vcmenh, the corresponding residue, arg <dig>  adopts a different rotamer and the side chain is directed towards α <dig> whilst tyr <dig> occupies the site of the samenh arg <dig> guanidinium . this observation suggests a degree of conformational freedom deep in the active site that might influence the position of the cap domain.

attempts to soak ligands such as pyruvate, salicylic acid and the substrate sephchc into crystals of samenh, and so derive structures directly relevant to substrate recognition resulted in the loss of diffraction. co-crystallization experiments were also carried out but either the crystals did not grow or when available and subsequently analyzed, there was no electron density that could be attributed to these ligands . in the absence of any experimentally determined structures we sought to prepare a simple model of the enzyme-substrate  complex. we were guided by seeking a position of sephch in the active site in which there was little steric hindrance and where the chemical properties of substrate and active site were complementary to each other. the potential for his <dig> to act as a base and acquire the c <dig> proton direct from substrate was recognized. however, when the substrate was positioned to facilitate the interaction of sephch c <dig> with his <dig> ne <dig> there were severe steric clashes with the protein. the positions of the leu <dig> and phe <dig> side chains in particular appear to compromise such a model. we cannot rule out the possibility that gross structural changes might change the active site to facilitate the use of his <dig> as an active site base for the menh reaction but note that there is no evidence to support such conformational changes to the catalytic residues utilized within the α/β hydrolase family of enzymes. an alternative model was constructed by placing sephchc c <dig>  <dig>  Å from ser <dig> og. the ligand was simply rotated about c <dig> to minimize steric clash with the enzyme  and, as will be described, the model suggests plausible chemical interactions to stabilize the substrate in the enzyme active site.

our es model provides a template to consider aspects of substrate recognition and menh catalysis. in this we expect that important features relevant to substrate recognition and catalysis be conserved in menh sequences and the α/β-hydrolase fold as discussed above. we noted also that the position of water molecules might identify where functional groups of substrate could bind. a thorough analysis, combining kinetic studies with the use of site-directed mutagenesis studies has been applied to seven conserved menh residues using the e. coli enzyme . the kinetic results were interpreted in light of a homology model of ecmenh based on vcmenh combined with the use of docking calculations  <cit> . our samenh es model , which should be consistent with the kinetic data, indeed corroborates certain aspects of the previous study but there are significant differences in the models, which we will detail.

our es model suggests that arg <dig> is placed to interact with the c <dig> hydroxyl and or the c <dig> carboxylate. lys <dig> could also interact with the c <dig> carboxylate and arg <dig> is well placed to form a salt-bridge interaction with the c <dig> carboxylate. the substrate c <dig> carboxylate, the succinyl substituent, is positioned in the solvent filled channel and placed to accept hydrogen bonds donated from tyr <dig> oh and trp <dig> ne <dig>  the hydrophobic component, c <dig>  c <dig> and the methylene group are positioned over towards the hydrophobic patch on the active site near leu <dig> and phe <dig>  mutations of the conserved arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> to alanine leads to increased km values and reduced catalytic properties. this is compatible with a role of these arginine residues in binding and orientating the substrate in the active site. arg <dig> does not interact with substrate in the es model but we cannot rule out a conformational change that facilitates an interaction between the guanidinium and the c <dig> carboxylate. the side chain of arg <dig> is implicated in positioning trp <dig> and disruption of the structure in this part of the active site might contribute to the compromised level of enzyme activity. asp <dig> interacts with arg <dig> and mutation of the corresponding residue, asp <dig>  in ecmenh to alanine leads to an eight-fold increase in km  <cit>  consistent with localized disruption to substrate binding.

the mechanism of typical α/β hydrolases involves the formation of an oxyanion intermediate stabilized in the active site by an "oxyanion-binding hole" usually formed by two main chain amides. one amide is contributed from the residue immediately following the catalytic serine, the second can vary in location but often resides on the loop linking a β-strand and helix. jiang et al.  <cit>  proposed that the oxyanion hole is located between the side chains of tyr <dig> and trp <dig>  based on results of computational docking calculations. this would be an extremely unusual situation not previously observed in this enzyme family. in samenh the main chain amides of met <dig> and phe <dig> are well placed to form the oxyanion hole; indeed a well-ordered water molecule is observed within hydrogen bonding distance of both nitrogen atoms in addition to the side chain of ser <dig> . a similar situation occurs in vcmenh, with the corresponding residues being ser <dig>  leu <dig> and leu <dig>  structural alignment with other α/β hydrolases where the oxyanion hole has been identified support our interpretation  <cit> . in our es model, a carbonyl oxygen of the succinyl substituent, where a negative charge might build up, overlays on the position of this ordered water molecule . that being the case we suggest a different role for the conserved tryptophan . mutation of the equivalent residue in ecmenh, trp <dig> to phenylalanine, had significantly less effect on catalysis than a trp <dig> to alanine mutation  <cit> . this further suggests that the side chain is not actually involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole. our es model suggests that trp <dig> stabilizes the hydrophobic part of the active site by interactions with phe <dig>  phe <dig> and leu <dig> and that trp <dig> ne <dig>  in partnership with tyr <dig> oh, donate hydrogen bonds to bind the carboxylate of the succinyl side group of the substrate . alteration of tyr <dig> to phenylalanine increases km slightly but reduces catalytic efficiency to a marked degree. this would support the earlier proposal that interaction with his <dig> might influence catalysis.

a proposed mechanism for menh
all α/β hydrolases contain a catalytic triad consisting of a nucleophile, an acid and a histidine. in many cases, the reaction proceeds in a similar fashion to that of the serine proteases, where the substrate is subject to nucleophilic attack by serine, for example prolyl oligopeptidase  <cit> . the histidine and aspartate components of the catalytic triad are essential for ecmenh activity; mutation of the serine resulted in a considerably less active, but still functional enzyme, suggesting a mechanism distinct from most other α/β hydrolases  <cit>  but similar to the c-c bond hydrolases mhpc and bhpd. mutation of the active site serine in mhpc reduces but does not abolish enzyme activity and additional kinetic studies lead to the assignment of a general base catalysis mechanism  <cit> . the non-essentiality of the active site serine in menh suggests that it may also adopt a general base mechanism.

the reaction catalyzed by menh can be described in three stages . in stage i, the catalytic triad structure positions his <dig> to abstract a proton from ser <dig> og and so prepare a seryl oxide which in turn supports removal of the acidic c <dig> proton from sephchc. an anionic intermediate is generated. stage ii is breaking the c5-o bond to release the pyruvate side chain; a common step in biosynthetic reactions that use chorismate. however, in most cases, the product is aromatic  <cit>  and menh is unusual in generating a partially saturated product. nevertheless, the stability expected when a conjugated system is present is likely a major driving force in pyruvate elimination from c <dig> subsequent to the abstraction of the proton from c <dig>  in stage iii, methylene is reduced to the pyruvate methyl by addition of a proton and the product then leaves the active site.

whereas mutation of the active site serine does not completely destroy menh activity, alteration of the catalytic his <dig> is catastrophic. the explanation may reside in the combination of two factors. firstly, the substrate has a relatively labile acidic c <dig> proton irrespective of whether a seryl oxide is nearby to acquire it or not. the difference is in the rate of proton loss. secondly, his <dig> is primed by association with asp <dig> and tyr <dig> to abstract a proton from any nearby hydroxyl group or a water molecule, which can then be passed on to reduce the methylene to a methyl. an attraction between this intermediate and the protonated his <dig> could assist a movement of the amino acid side chain into a position whereby donation of a proton to the methylene group is possible.

CONCLUSIONS
the high-resolution crystal structure of samenh, an α/β hydrolase, has been determined and detailed comparisons carried out with proteins of related fold. the menh active site properties complement those of the substrate, which is negatively charged and possesses significant hydrophobic character. the enzyme:substrate complex has been modelled and a potential mechanism, exploiting previously published data combining site-directed mutagenesis with kinetic studies of ecmenh, is proposed. the reaction may be initiated by proton abstraction from the substrate by an activated ser <dig>  part of a catalytic triad with asp <dig> and his <dig>  the driving force for pyruvate elimination is provided by the formation of a conjugated system. during pyruvate elimination, a methylene group is converted to a methyl and it is possible that his <dig> provides a proton, acquired from ser <dig> for that reduction.
