BACKGROUND
nr2e <dig>  is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates neural stem cell maintenance and self-renewal  <cit>  and promotes tumourigenesis  <cit> . nr2e <dig> is crucial for adult stem cell proliferation  <cit>  and plays an important role in spatial learning through promoting hippocampal neurogenesis  <cit> . nr2e1-null mice are highly aggressive, have reduced cortical thickness and limbic structures  <cit> , and display aberrant retinal development . however, despite increased understanding regarding nr2e <dig> biological function and its gene targets  <cit>  over the past few years, its precise molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood.

nuclear receptors interact with multi-protein co-activator or co-repressor complexes to activate or repress transcription, respectively. these co-regulator complexes have histone modification and chromatin remodeling functions that elicit transcriptional control. many co-regulators interact with the hydrophobic groove of nuclear receptors through specific motifs. co-repressors use the consensus amino acid sequence lxxxixxxl or co-repressor nuclear receptor  box motif  <cit> , while co-activators utilize an lxxll binding motif, also called the nuclear receptor box  <cit> .

nr2e <dig> functions mainly as a repressor of gene transcription and interacts with the co-repressors atrophin- <dig>   <cit> , histone demethylase  <dig>   <cit> , histone deacetylases   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and the oncoprotein bcl11a  <cit> . in addition, nr2e <dig> can act as an activator of gene transcription by binding to the promoters of wnt7a  <cit> , and mash <dig>  <cit> . despite all this knowledge, the composition and dynamics of the co-repressor complexes formed by nr2e <dig> are not well understood and, to date, no co-activator proteins have been found to interact with nr2e <dig>  the crystal structure of nr2e <dig> in complex with a short sequence from atrophins  was recently resolved showing that the autorepressed conformation of nr2e <dig> creates a pocket to recruit atrophins, which bind to nr2e <dig> through an unconventional sequence: alxxlxxy  <cit> .

to test whether nr2e <dig> could also bind to co-activators, we used a microarray assay for real-time analysis of co-regulator–nuclear receptor interaction   <cit>  containing peptides representing co-regulator interacting sequences for which the lxxll motif was highly enriched. although many different approaches to characterize protein-protein interactions have been developed including far-western, yeast-two-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assays , and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry, the marconi array has the advantages of being high-throughput and allowing for rapid testing of small molecules or mutants that could affect the interaction of a nuclear receptor with its protein partners.

we confirmed the specificity of binding of nr2e <dig> to peptides in the array by using two single-point variants in the ligand binding domain: r274g and r276q. we also evaluated whether r274g had an overt effect on retinal development in a mouse model carrying this variant as a single copy insertion.

RESULTS
to find novel transcriptional co-regulators that interact with nr2e <dig>  we incubated the n-terminal flag-tagged ligand-binding domain  with peptides of a microarray assay for real-time analysis of co-regulator–nuclear receptor interaction  . this array contained  <dig> peptides from  <dig> co-regulator proteins. many of these peptides harbored the lxxll motif. since the array did not contain any previously known direct interactors for nr2e <dig>  we added a peptide from atrophin- <dig> as a positive control. this peptide is referred to as the atro box and is comprised of  <dig> amino acids that are highly conserved among atrophins and found to be necessary for the interaction between nr2e <dig> and atrophin- <dig>  <cit> . two additional amino acids on each side were included for stability in the array . mutations in the two leucines of the atro box to alanines  abolish the interaction between drosophila atro and nr2e <dig> in yeast-two-hybrid assays  <cit> . therefore, we included an atro box containing these two leucine to-alanine substitutions as a negative control.

we found that flag-nr2e1lbd interacted very strongly with the atro-box peptide in the array but bound very poorly to the mutant atro box . this suggests that the array binding conditions are permissive for nr2e <dig> protein:protein interactions, and therefore appropriate for identifying novel interactions between nr2e <dig> and co-regulators.fig.  <dig> marconi array validated with atro box. cell lysates from hek <dig> cells expressing wild-type flag-nr2e1lbd or variant flag-nr2e1lbd  protein truncations were prepared. vehicle-treated cells were also included. these lysates were tested in the marconi array, which contained a wild-type  and mutant  atro box as positive and negative controls, respectively. flag-nr2e1lbd interacted strongly with the wild-type atro box and with significantly reduced affinity to the mutant atro box. the flag-nr2e1ldb variants did not bind to either of the atro peptides. au, arbitrary units; lbd, ligand binding domain; *, significantly different from wild-type . n = 3




flag-nr2e1lbd also bound to  <dig> other peptides belonging to  <dig> proteins after applying false discovery rate correction for array size  and eliminating negative fluorescence values . these interactions were; however, weaker than the interaction with atrophin- <dig>  and may represent indirect interactions. importantly, none of these proteins have previously been shown to directly or indirectly bind to nr2e <dig> fig.  <dig> twenty six novel co-regulator interacting peptides identified as binding to nr2e <dig> lbd in the marconi array. cell lysates from hek <dig> cells expressing wild-type flag-nr2e1lbd or variant flag-nr2e1lbd  protein truncations were prepared. vehicle-treated cells were also included. these lysates were tested in the marconi array, which contained  <dig> peptides from  <dig> co-regulator proteins. only the significant flag-nr2e1lbd binding interactions with  <dig> co-regulators  are depicted in the histogram. the nr2e1lbd variants abolished the majority of binding interactions observed between wild-type nr2e1lbd and co-regulator peptides. however, triangles indicate peptides that did not interact significantly differently with nr2e1lbd wild-type and the variant . au, arbitrary units; lbd, ligand binding domain; peptide id: co-regulator uniprot id_amino acid start_amino acid end




some of the peptides that interacted with flag-nr2elbd in the array are cofactors known to function primarily in co-activator complexes. these include the src family members ncoa <dig> , ncoa <dig>  and ncoa <dig>   <cit> ; the atp-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  <dig>   <cit> ; proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator   <cit> ; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator-related   <cit> ; the scaffold transformation/transcription domain-associated protein   <cit>  and the histone acetyltransferase p <dig>  <cit>  .

other proteins that showed significant binding to flag-nr2elbd in the array are known to be primarily part of co-repressor complexes. these include the cell-cycle checkpoint protein human homolog of rad <dig>  <cit> ; the nr2e <dig> co-repressor and rna helicase dhx <dig>   <cit> ; the hdac-associated protein ncor <dig>   <cit> ; and nuclear receptor interacting protein  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, we found that six out of  <dig> nrip1-derived peptides representing different motifs in the array showed significant interaction with flag-nr2elbd .

we also observed that other co-regulators that can act as either co-activators or co-repressors are also targets in the array. these proteins are proline, glutamate and leucine rich protein  <dig>   <cit> ; the histone methyltransferase nuclear receptor binding set domain protein  <dig>   <cit> , and tripartite motif containing  <dig>   <cit>  .

in addition, transcription factors such as prospero homeobox  <dig>  and androgen receptor  also interacted with flag-nr2elbd in the array . prox <dig> functions as a co-regulator through lxxll motifs  <cit>  and ar harbors lxxll-like motifs  <cit> .

other proteins that are sufficient to inhibit transcription factors were also candidate partners for nr2e <dig>  these include p <dig> protein -activated kinase  <dig> , which phosphorylates ar and inhibits its transcriptional activity  <cit> ; and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells , that inhibits nf-kappa-b by sequestering it in the cytoplasm  <cit>  .

to further assess the specificity of the array, we developed two flag-nr2e <dig> variants, each harboring a single-point variant in the lbd of nr2e1: an arginine-to-glycine substitution in codon  <dig>  and an arginine-to-glutamine substitution in codon  <dig> . the lbd of nr2e <dig> is highly conserved in vertebrates , so we hypothesized that amino-acid changes in the lbd will affect the ability of nr2e <dig> to interact with its protein partners. we previously identified an amino-acid change of unknown significance in arginine 274-to-glycine in the human population  in the heterozygous state  <cit> . this arginine is highly conserved not only within nr2e <dig> but also within its close relative nr2e <dig>  furthermore, amino-acid similarity is also found in other nuclear receptors of the same family such as nr2f <dig> where there is a lysine instead of an arginine in aligned regions of the ligand binding domain corresponding to nr2e <dig> codon  <dig> . this conservation suggests that an amino-acid with a positively-charged side chain in this region is important for normal protein function. furthermore, arginine  <dig> corresponds to arginine  <dig> in nr2e <dig> and its substitution to glycine in nr2e <dig> affects photoreceptor development in humans  <cit> . interestingly, we observed that both variants caused a reduction in the binding of nr2e <dig> to the atro box and the majority of the peptide interactions found in the array . the exceptions were peptides belonging to pelp <dig>  ikbb, cdh <dig> and nrip <dig> which did not show a significant reduction in interaction with flag-nr2e1lbd r274g and r276q, and also pak <dig> and ncoa <dig>  which showed comparable binding to flag-nr2e1lbd r276q and wild-type nr2e <dig>  but reduced binding to flag-nr2e1lbd r274g .fig.  <dig> arginines  <dig> and  <dig> are highly conserved in nr2e <dig>  ucsc genome browser  image depicting nr2e <dig>  and the conservation region of the two most related nuclear receptor binding domains; nr2e <dig> and nr2f <dig>  a positively charged amino acid is conserved at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  nr2e <dig> shows complete identity of arginine  <dig> and  <dig> from humans to zebrafish . in nr2e <dig>   <dig> is similarly conserved, but  <dig> becomes lysine in distant species. in nr2f <dig> a lysine, instead of arginine, is similarly conserved at both positions




we further studied the ability of flag-nr2e1lbd r274g or r276q to interact with human atrophin- <dig> by affinity purification assays. we used bacterially expressed atrophin-1-gst  containing the atro box as a bait and incubated it with hek <dig> lysates containing the wild-type and variant flag-nr2e1lbd proteins used in the peptide array. in agreement with what we observed in the array, there was decreased binding of both r274g and r276q to atrophin- <dig> suggesting that these amino acid changes alter the conformation of nr2e <dig> and its capacity to interact with its protein partners .fig.  <dig> nr2e <dig> variants r274g and r276g exhibited decreased binding to atrophin- <dig>  gst, or gst-atrophin-1846– <dig> containing the atro box, were over-expressed in e.coli and incubated with hek <dig> cell lysate containing either flag-nr2e1lbd, flag-nr2e1lbd r274g, or flag-nr2e1lbd r276q. after incubation with glutathione/sepharose beads, purified complexes were resolved by sds-page followed by western blot using an anti-flag antibody. a note the decreased binding of the flag-nr2e1lbd r274g and r276q variants to gst-arophin-1846– <dig>  b western blot quantification of three independent experiments. the signal intensity detected with anti-flag antibody for each pull down was normalized to the input signal. note that wild-type nr2e <dig> binds eight times more to atrophin- <dig> compared to r274g. error bars, standard error of the mean; gst, glutathione-s-transferase; lbd, ligand binding domain flag. n = 3




we selected two proteins, ar and p <dig>  from the array for further analysis. ar is a nuclear hormone receptor of the nr3c class. we chose ar because in addition to its well-known role in cancer and male reproductive function, it also has a role in neurogenesis . the array included the fxxlf motif of ar, located in its nh2-terminal region. this motif interacts with ar itself to stabilize the ligand-bound ar complex by interacting with different regions of the ar ligand binding domain  <cit> . the fxxlf motif also mediates ar interaction with co-regulators such as melanoma antigen gene protein-a <dig>   <cit> . p <dig> is an acetyltransferase that acetylates histones and other proteins. p <dig> also acts as a scaffold for transcription factors and other components of the basal transcription machinery to facilitate chromatin remodeling and gene transcription  <cit> . we chose p <dig> because it is a co-activator that has well-established roles in regulating neural stem cell differentiation  <cit> . we observed that ar and p <dig> precipitated with nr2e <dig> in reciprocal pull-downs . importantly, we also verified the lack of binding of prgc <dig> in the marconi array by pull-down experiments .fig.  <dig> nr2e <dig> interacted with p <dig> and androgen receptor. gst, or gst-nr2e1lbd were over-expressed in e.coli and incubated with hek <dig> cell lysate containing different overexpressed proteins:  myc-tagged p <dig> , egfp-tagged androgen receptor  and myc-tagged prgc <dig> . after incubation with glutathione/sepharose beads, purified complexes were resolved by sds-page followed by western blot using anti-egfp, and anti-myc antibodies. note that p <dig> and ar do not bind to the gst control but are pulled-down with nr2e1-gst. also note the absence of binding of prgc <dig> to both gst control and gst-nr2e <dig>  gst input represents images of ponceau s-stained blots that were converted to black and white. b immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-p <dig>  anti-egpp, and anti-myc antibodies. complexes were resolved by sds-page followed by western blot. gst-nr2e <dig> was detected using anti-gst antibody. note the binding of gst-nr2e <dig> to p <dig> and ar but not to prgc <dig>  gst, glutathione-s-transferase; ip, immunoprecipitation; wb, western blot




since the nr2e <dig> variants used in this study have a dramatic effect on the ability of nr2e <dig> to interact with its partners, we studied the effects of r274g during retinogenesis in vivo. we utilized the eye due to its salient and robust phenotype in nr2e1-null  mice of retinal disorganization and abnormal blood vessels, as well as for the feasibility of studying eye defects. we have previously shown that a wild-type copy of human nr2e <dig> can rescue the nr2e1-null phenotype in the eye  <cit> . we analyzed the retinal blood vessel numbers and retinal thickness of a transgenic mouse harboring the r274g mutation as a single-copy on the x-chromosome  <cit> . we compared littermates that were wild-type, nr2e1
frc/+ or nr2e1
frc/frc, with or without the single-copy hprt knock-in r274g variant. in this way, we could study possible gain of function, dominant negative or loss of function behavior of r274g. strikingly, we found that the variant r274g did not affect blood vessel or radial symmetry . similarly, the reduced retinal thickness of nr2e1
frc/frc mice was not observed in mice harboring the r274g variant on any of the nr2e <dig> backgrounds studied , suggesting the ability to functionally act as wild-type. in conclusion, r274g does not generate an overt retinal phenotype suggesting that there are compensatory mechanisms that rescue the reduced nr2e <dig> binding observed in vitro.fig.  <dig> the variant r274g rescued retinal blood vessel numbers and thickness. p <dig> nr2e1

discussion
in this study, we used a peptide array to find novel interactors for nr2e <dig> that revealed  <dig> candidate co-regulator proteins. we also found two single amino-acid variants of nr2e <dig> that disrupted its binding to most co-regulators and that one of them, r274g, did not have an overt physiological significance in the retina. our results identify putative co-regulators that can interact with nr2e <dig> 

proteins interact through domains, many of which bind to short peptide sequences  <cit> . although the peptides in the array represent some of these short linear sequences, they lack the context of the full protein and thus may participate in non-specific interactions. to evaluate the specificity of the array and the appropriateness of this approach, we used as a positive control the atro box, and as a negative internal control the mutated atro box. we also used the flag-nr2e1lbd single amino-acid variants r274g and r276q as experimental negative controls. we observed strong binding of nr2e <dig> to the wild-type atro box and decreased binding to the mutated atro box. furthermore, we observed that flag-nr2e1lbd r274g and r276q failed to interact with most of the nr2e <dig> putative interactors in the array suggesting that these variants generated a conformational change in nr2e <dig> that prevented its binding to other proteins. this hypothesis was further strengthened in pull-down assays using atrophin- <dig> as bait where both nr2e <dig> variants interacted with atrophin- <dig> with much less affinity than with wild-type. together, these data suggest that the binding of nr2e <dig> to the interactors in the array was specific.

importantly, we noted that the binding of nr2e <dig> to other peptides in the array was weaker than the binding observed for atrophin- <dig>  a known direct nr2e <dig> interactor. this could be due to the fact that the interaction of nr2e <dig> to the other peptides in the array is more transient or indirect.

our results then suggest that nr2e <dig> uses different co-regulator complexes to affect neural precursor behavior. for example, mouse prox <dig>  an interactor of nr2e <dig> in the array, has a role in controlling the balance between neural progenitor self-renewal and neuronal differentiation by inhibiting notch <dig> expression  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the prox <dig> homolog in drosophila, prospero, is regulated by the homolog of nr2e <dig>  tlx  <cit> , suggesting a role for nr2e <dig> in controlling prox <dig> biological output. another interactor in the array that is also a neural precursor-related protein is dhx <dig> , which is important for mediating nr2e <dig> repressor function in retinal progenitor cells  <cit> .

an intriguing co-repressor target is nrip <dig> that had  <dig> motifs in the array, out of which six interacted with nr2e <dig>  nrip <dig> is expressed in the brain including the neurogenic region of the dentate gyrus  <cit> , but its role in neurogenesis, if any, is unknown and worth exploring.

interestingly, three co-activators members of the src family  were found to interact with nr2e <dig> in the array. although it is unknown whether they have a role in neural stem cell behavior, there is some evidence that src- <dig> could be involved in neurogenesis as it is upregulated during neuronal differentiation in vitro  <cit> .

two important scaffolds of multi-protein co-activator complexes, trrap and p <dig>  also interacted with nr2e <dig> in the array. trrap is found mutated in patients with schizophrenia  <cit>  and controls the tumourigenicity of brain tumour initiating cells which resemble neural stem cells  <cit> . in the brain, p <dig> mediates the induction of the astrocyte lineage  <cit>  and works with the transcription factor zfp <dig> to directly activate early neural genes  <cit> . understanding the biological importance of the interaction of these adaptor proteins with nr2e <dig> would greatly advance our knowledge of nr2e <dig> mechanisms of action.

many nuclear receptors have been shown to cooperate to regulate gene transcription. it is an interesting possibility that ar and nr2e <dig> could function in a complex to synergistically regulate adult neurogenesis where testosterone plays a role  <cit> . in addition, this interaction could be important during the development of prostate cancer where nr2e <dig> has been shown to have an oncogenic function  <cit> .

importantly, we successfully pulled-down p <dig> and ar with gst-nr2e <dig>  thus reproducing by an orthogonal experiment the results from the array. this strongly suggests that the array is a reliable tool to identify novel nuclear receptor interactors.

intriguingly, the variant r274g did not have an effect on retinal development in vivo. since we observed decreased binding of r274g to atrophin- <dig> in two orthogonal approaches, we suggest that nr2e <dig> protein conformation was indeed compromised by this arginine-to-glycine substitution. it is possible that the interactions detected in this study are not functional during gross retinal development or that there may have been a compensatory mechanism such as upregulation of nr2e <dig> or some of its co-regulators to compensate for the lower affinity of nr2e <dig> towards its protein partners. alternatively, since we only used the ligand binding domain of nr2e <dig> in the array whereas our mouse strains express the full length protein , it is possible that the nr2e1-co-regulator complexes are more stable in the full length conformation. in this way, some co-regulators could bind to nr2e <dig> through both its lbd and dbd as is the case for lsd <dig>  <cit> . it is also possible that variant r274g could have an effect on brain development. however, we could not assess this phenotype as the bac we use in this study does not completely rescue the brain abnormalities observed in nr2e
−/−  <cit> .

the mouse model harboring the variant r274g validates again the usefulness of our cloning strategy showing that a single-copy human gene incorporated into the hprt locus is functional. this strategy could be useful to study human mutations in the regulatory or coding regions of disease-causing genes.

similar to coup-tfii, which can be activated by retinoic acids despite its autorepressed conformation  <cit> , nr2e <dig> can be regulated by artificial ligands  <cit> . therefore, a peptide array could represent a rapid screening tool for small molecules that modify the ability of nr2e <dig> to bind co-regulators.

CONCLUSIONS
by using a highly specific peptide array, we uncovered novel putative interactors for nr2e <dig> including the co-activator p <dig> and the nuclear receptor ar. future experiments will aim to validate the interactions here discovered and understand their biological significance. this array could be used to test small molecules and mutations that may alter the interaction of nr2e <dig> with co-regulators and therefore its transcriptional function.
