BACKGROUND
mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites commonly present in the feed and food, and are widely considered as hazardous contaminants. however, the toxicity of these natural chemicals are not properly evaluated because of the difficulties in isolating these chemicals and also because of the lack of interests as they have no industrial applications. the costs for producing the pure mycotoxins are the biggest obstacle in their evaluation process. on the other hand, development of analytical methods are needed to identify new mycotoxins, to fight against the spreading toxins, and also to meet the growing demands for the toxicological studies.

citrinin  <cit> ,  <dig> -dihydro-8-hydroxy- <dig> ,5-trimethyl-6-oxo-3h-2-benzopyran-7-crboxylic acid , which was first isolated from penicillium citrinum  <cit> , is produced by more than  <dig> kinds of fungi  <cit> . citrinin is the one of the well-known mycotoxins, which is possibly spread all over the world. although citrinin is one of the well-characterized mycotoxins, information on its mechanism of toxic action is limited. clinically, citrinin was shown to cause renal disease in poultry, pigs, dogs and rats  <cit> . the electron transport system of the kidney and liver mitochondria were considered as the target of the toxic action of citrinin  <cit> .

the availability of yeast dna microarrays provides the possibility of monitoring gene expression levels as a function of toxin exposure, and consequently, provides a mean to determine the mechanism of toxicity  <cit> . the essential features of this yeast system are the small volume of yeast culture required for the analysis, high reproducibility of the expression profiles and availability of the massive functional information of genes on dna microarray  <cit> . for example, cadmium treatment was found to induce yeast genes involved in the sulfur amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress response, and heat shock response  <cit> . this expression pattern of induced genes was in agreement with many previous studies  <cit> . we applied this system to evaluate the action mechanism of patulin, one of the most potent mycotoxins, and found that patulin targets proteins and possibly dna  <cit> . our results suggested that patulin probably acts as a mutagen  <cit> .

in this report, we studied the toxicity of citrinin to yeast cells using the traditional orf  dna microarray  <cit>  and oligo  dna microarray systems  <cit> . results from both microarray studies suggested that the oxidative stress was the main cause for toxicity, but this oxidative stress did not lead to any dna damage. this observation was different from what was found with another mycotoxin patulin  <cit> . to detoxify against the citrinin, the yeast cells mainly used glutathione modification and pumped out the toxin using transporters. we have also discussed how the two dna microarrays were adapted for evaluating the mycotoxin action.

RESULTS
conditions for the citrinin treatment
as a first step, we characterized the effect of citrinin on yeast growth because without any biological or physiological characterization we will not be able to prove that the induction or repression of specific genes is due to the treatment. lack of growth inhibition would merely indicate that the conditions used for the study did not cause any cellular stress. figure  <dig> shows yeast growth as a function of different concentrations of citrinin. as shown, we observed growth inhibition at concentrations greater than  <dig> ppm, and at  <dig> ppm of citrinin there was no growth. based on this dose-response analysis,  <dig> ppm of citrinin was chosen for subsequent experiments, as this concentration was found to be inhibitory to non-lethal growth . this concentration citrinin is slightly higher than that was used for the patulin treatment  <cit> , and citrinin may be less toxic to yeast cells.

overview of citrinin induced and repressed genes through orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray
from three independent citrinin treatment experiments, we obtained  <dig> sheets of dna microarray results. three sheets  were from the orf dna microarray, one from each citrinin treatment. for the oligo dna microarray, we performed three hybridizations for each experiment and obtained  <dig> sheets of data , including dye swap for the ol-1- <dig>  ol-1- <dig>  and ol-1- <dig> sheets. from the microarray data  we calculated the correlation factors to determine the reproducibility between the different hybridization conditions , citrinin treatment , dye swap , and dna microarray . the correlation factors for the orf dna microarray were from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for the oligo dna microarrays, the correlation factors were from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for  <dig> sheets, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the same source of total rna . the correlation factors between the orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray showed relatively low correlation factors  than those among the same type of dna microarray. these results suggest that the reproducibility of the oligo dna microarray is better than those of the orf dna microarray .

from the orf dna microarray, we obtained  <dig>  orfs exhibiting intensities over the cut-off value at least in one experiment. among these orfs,  <dig> orfs showed more than two times higher intensity than that of the untreated control and having t-test p-value less than  <dig> . in addition,  <dig> orfs, having statistically different intensities from that of the control with the t-test p-value less than  <dig> , were recognized as induced genes. on the other hand,  <dig> orfs, having two times lower intensity than that of the untreated control and having t-test p-value less than  <dig> , were recognized as repressed genes. similarly,  <dig> orfs having statistically different intensities from the control with the t-test p-value less than  <dig>  were also recognized as repressed genes.

from the oligo dna microarray, we obtained  <dig>  orfs exhibiting intensities over the cut-off value at least in one experiment. among these orfs,  <dig> orfs showed more than two times higher intensity than that of the untreated control and having t-test p-value less than  <dig> . in addition,  <dig> orfs, having statistically different intensities from the control with the t-test p-value less than  <dig> , were recognized as induced genes. on the other hand,  <dig> orfs, having two times lower intensity than that of the untreated control and having t-test p-value less than  <dig> , were recognized as repressed genes. similarly,  <dig> orfs were recognized as repressed genes whose intensities were statistically different from that of the control with the t-test p-value less than  <dig> . apparently, the number of induced and repressed genes  were higher for the orf dna microarray and the number of statistically significant  induced and repressed genes were higher for the oligo dna microarray. these differences might arise from the different numbers of data collected from the two microarrays.

to compare with the other stress factors, we carried out the cluster analysis of the orf and oligo dna microarray expression data using the average value for each microarray. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression profiles of the orf microarray and oligo microarray clustered together. the citrinin-induced response was very similar to that of the maneb. the citrinin-induced gene expression data did not cluster with those of the patulin, thiuram and acrolein. these results suggest that the citrinin treatment-induced response was not similar to that of the mycotoxin patulin. thus, unlike patulin, which is known to target proteins  <cit> , citrinin might not cause protein denaturation.

functional categogorization of citrinin induced genes
to characterize the effect of citrinin to yeast cells, the induced genes were categorized using the functional categories of mips. as summarized in table  <dig>  there were significant number of induced genes in the categories of "metabolism", "cell rescue, defense and virulence", and "energy". in addition, a high percentage of genes in these categories were found to be induced  Ã— 100). in the category of "metabolism", the subcategories of "amino acid metabolism", "nitrogen and sulfur metabolism", "metabolism of vitamins", and "secondary metabolism" were significantly induced.

in the subcategories of "amino acid metabolism" and "nitrogen and sulfur metabolism", we found that the induced genes mainly belonged to the sulfur amino acid metabolism . among the  <dig> genes listed,  <dig> genes can be recognized as the induced genes in at least one of the dna microarrays. these results strongly suggest that the citrinin-treated yeast cells require methionine or glutathione. in the subcategories of "metabolism of vitamins" and "secondary metabolism", there were no groups of genes specific for vitamins and secondary metabolism, but they merely overlapped with the genes for the sulfur amino acid metabolism.

citrinin was suggested to cause damages to the mitochondria. table  <dig> lists the cellular localization of the induced gene products. it is clear that many of these gene products, which are localized in the mitochondria, were induced; however, the proportion of these induced genes among the total number of induced genes are not so high . the degrees of impact values of induced genes in the mitochondria from both the microarrays were very similar to the degree of impact value of the total genes in the entries . although our results suggest that citrinin affected mitochondria, but we can not say that the citrinin toxicity is specific to mitochondria. in the list of highly induced genes , the ylr346c, gtt <dig>  pdr <dig>  and ykl070w genes  were counted as the gene products localized in the mitochondria. as these genes are also expressed in other organelles and are not specific to mitochondrial function, our results suggest that the effect of citrinin on mitochondria is true but not specific.

the functional categories of the repressed genes were also characterized . as often seen with the stressed cells, the category of genes involved in "protein synthesis" were significantly repressed but other significant character was not observed. the repression of the genes in the category of "protein synthesis" can be the experimental marker, as this functional group is required for the actively growing cells, and not for the slowly growing or growth inhibited cells  <cit> .

confirmation of the significantly affected genes and evaluation of both dna microarrays
except the aad <dig>  aad <dig>  aad <dig>  and pau <dig>  the highly induced genes were common between the orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray. the aad genes have strong similarity to each other and this caused cross hybridization in the orf dna microarray  <cit> . some of the highly induced aad genes could cross hybridize to the orf dna microarray spots corresponding to the aad <dig>  aad <dig>  and aad <dig>  to confirm which aad gene was really induced, we performed rt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  citrinin treatment induced the aad <dig>  aad <dig>  and aad <dig> genes, but not the aad <dig>  aad <dig>  aad <dig>  and aad <dig> genes. thus, the induction of the aad  <dig>  aad <dig>  and aad <dig> genes, as observed by both microarray analysis, were correct whereas the induction of the aad <dig>  aad <dig>  aad <dig>  and aad <dig> genes in orf dna microarray and the induction of the aad <dig> in oligo dna microarray were due to cross hybridization. we confirmed that the aad <dig> probe has only one mismatch to the aad <dig> orf, and the apparent induction of the aad <dig> was due to the cross hybridiztion to the aad <dig>  in the oligo dna microarray, it seems that the cross hybridization has a limit of one miss match. the pau <dig> gene was also highly induced by citrinin treatment in oligo dna microarray. this gene has high similarity to other pau genes, which were not induced. we, however, could not confirm the induction of the pau genes by rt-pcr. thus, the apparent induction of the pau <dig> was most likely due to the cross hybridization with some highly induced unknown gene.

discussion
mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that may be toxic to all kinds of organisms. so far, a few hundreds of mycotoxins are identified and this number can increase dramatically with the development of analytical equipment. mycotoxins are naturally occurring chemicals. the large-scale production and industrial applications of these mycotoxins are limited, because the purification of these mycotoxins are costly and inadequate. therefore, only a few mycotoxins were studied in detail. the dna microarray technology provides an alternative evaluation tool to examine chemical toxicity in organisms. particularly, the yeast dna microarray is appropriate for evaluating the action of the mycotoxin because of the less amount of toxin required in this assay and good reproducibility of the expression profile.

citrinin is the one of the well known mycotoxins produced by penicillium and aspergillus family and is possibly spread all over the world  <cit> . the yeast-based orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray can provide information on the possible mechanisms of toxicity and detoxification effort by yeast cells. the list of highly induced genes in citrinin-treated yeast cells  clearly shows that the aads, oye <dig>  met <dig>  and gre <dig> genes, which are typical indicator genes for the oxidative stress  <cit> , are highly induced. thus, we can conclude that citrinin treatment causes oxidative stress. previously, delneli et al.  <cit>  analyzed several aad deletion mutants and suggested that only aad <dig> and aad <dig> were induced by oxidative stress. our rt-pcr results however suggest the aad <dig> gene is induced. except oxidative stress, we could not find any other cell repair response. it was suggested that citrinin causes damage to the mitochondria. however, we could not confirm that citrinin specifically affects mitochondria. mitochondria can be the source of oxidative stress. thus, it is possible that the oxidative stress caused by citrinin could enhance the self-induced oxidative damages in mitochondria. the mycotoxin patulin produced response in yeast cells that was similar to that of the citrinin, as the oxidative stress related genes were also induced by patulin treatment  <cit> . in addition, the patulin treatment strongly induced the genes contributing to the protein metabolism and dna repair, and patulin was considered as a natural mutagenic chemical  <cit> . however, in comparison to the patulin treatment, the citrinin treatment did not induce the genes contributing to dna repair . except the oxidative stress, citrinin did not show any significant toxicity to yeast cells. the less toxicity of citrinin than the patulin was also reported in other organisms  <cit> .

contrast to the information concerning the mechanism of citrinin-induced toxicity, information on the detoxification mechanism was clear. the activation of the methionine and glutathione metabolisms  strongly suggest the contribution of glutathione in the detoxification process. moreover, strong induction of the dtt <dig> gene implies direct transfer of glutathione to citrinin. as the pdrs were also strongly induced , it may be possible that the abc transporters were involved in pumping out the citrinin-glutathione complex. pumping out the toxin after glutathione modification is one of the main detoxification pathway used by many organism  <cit> .

during the process of evaluating the citrinin toxicity, we also compared reproducibility of the orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray. the oligo dna microarray showed higher correlation factor than the orf dna microarray . this may have resulted from the cross hybridization exampled by aads. the apparent induction of the aads in the orf dna microarray was due to cross hybridization  <cit> . the oligo dna microarray showed less cross hybridization, as the expression levels of most of the aads obtained from this assay agreed with the rt-pcr results. however, the oligo dna microarray may have limits in terms of specificity, as the aad <dig> gene, which has one mismatch with the aad <dig> gene, was recognized as the induced gene. on the other hand, the pau <dig> gene was not recognized as the induced gene by the orf dna microarray and rt-pcr, but was recognized as induced gene by the oligo dna microarray. if the rt-pcr results were correct, these results suggest that the high specificity may not always produce correct results. although the oligo dna microarray did not completely overcome the cross hybridization in the case of single mismatch, it is still a useful tool for detecting gene expression differences between similar genes.

CONCLUSIONS
citrinin caused growth inhibition in yeast cells at a concentration more than  <dig> ppm. under this condition, we monitored the citrinin treatment-induced response using the orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray. results obtained from these microarray experiments suggest that citrinin induced oxidative stress in the yeast cells. the citrinin-induced genotoxicity was less severe than that of the patulin. thus, citrinin is a less toxic substance than patulin. the expression profiles obtained from both types of dna microarrays were essentially similar. the reproducibility of the expression profiles were much better and the cross hybridization was less with the oligo dna microarray.
