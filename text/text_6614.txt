BACKGROUND
cercospora beticola, an ascomycete, is the economically most important foliar pathogen of sugar beet . characteristic symptoms of c. beticola infection include brown leaf spots extending from the adaxial to the abaxial sides of the leaf; from spring to summer the spots increase in number as the disease progresses, finally coalescing such that the entire leaf turns brown and shrinks. leaf spot disease is economically critical because the destruction of the leaves limits photosynthesis and compromises yield  <cit> .

c. beticola propagates by macroconidia, asexual spores that overwinter in plant debris on the field and are spread in spring by wind and rain splash  <cit> . c. beticola is a hemibiotrophic fungus with biotrophic and necrotrophic phases. approximately 3- <dig> days after inoculation, the fungus enters the host through open stomata  <cit> ; after penetration, fungal hyphae grow intercellularly and colonize the leaf parenchymal tissue in an asymptomatic manner  <cit> . the final, necrotrophic phase is characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions, resulting in the leaf spots that are the typical sign of this disease. unlike other leaf pathogens that necrotize from pinpoint lesions and expand outward, lesions produced by c. beticola involve the near-simultaneous collapse of cells in an area many millimeters in diameter. the necrotized tissue becomes the site of conidiophore and conidial development. although lesions can expand after the initial tissue collapse, the increase in necrotic area on the leaf surface is due primarily to an increase in the number of lesions. one sporulation cycle under field conditions lasts approximately  <dig> days  <cit> .

the cercospora family has many members that have different hosts, including tobacco, soybean, coffee, rice, corn, and peanut  <cit> . cercospora species produce cercosporin, a photo-activated toxin that generates reactive oxygen species upon exposure to light. the cercosporin biosynthesis pathway in c. nicotianae has been shown to include eight genes, ctb1-ctb <dig>  ctb <dig>  a polyketide synthase, condenses and decarboxylates the precursors malonyl-coa and acetyl-coa to form a polyketide. it then catalyzes claisen condensation and ring closure of the molecule. the next steps are oxidation and hydration reactions executed by ctb <dig>  an o-methyltransferase and fad-dependent monooxygenase, ctb <dig>  a fad/fmn-dependent oxidoreductase, ctb <dig>  a nadph- dependent oxidoreductase, and ctb <dig>  another fad/fmn-dependent oxidoreductase. the subsequent methylation step is carried out by ctb <dig>  also an o-methyltransferase, and ctb <dig>  the resulting polyketomethylene is dimerized and then exported from the cells by ctb <dig>  a major facilitator superfamily transporter. this export mechanism leads to autoimmunity of c. beticola against its own toxin. cercosporin expression is regulated by the zinc-finger transcription factor ctb <dig> 

previous studies have demonstrated that individual inactivation of ctb <dig>  ctb <dig>  ctb <dig>  or ctb <dig> leads to the transcriptional inhibition of the entire gene cluster and prevents cercosporin production in c. nicotianae <cit> . the current study aimed to determine whether cercosporin production in c. beticola could be reduced by a single knock-out mutation, and to identify differences in the infection behaviors of wild type and toxin-deficient strains.

RESULTS
disruption of ctb <dig> in the fungal isolates ahlburg and ferrara
primers were designed using the homologous sequence from c. nicotianae . ctb <dig> of isolate ferrara was amplified via pcr; sequencing revealed that the coding region of the cbctb <dig> gene is  <dig> % identical to the coding region of cnctb <dig> gene. the derived amino acid sequence of cbctb <dig> is 96% identical to the protein from c. nicotianae.

the gene was disrupted in two isolates of c. beticola, ferrara and ahlburg. transformation resulted in  <dig> ferrara and  <dig> ahlburg transformants. for both isolates, two independent transformants were selected with a disrupted ctb <dig> gene . in the ferrara isolate, ctb <dig> gene disruptions  are subsequently called fΔctb2- <dig> and fΔctb2- <dig> and accordingly in the ahlburg isolate aΔctb2- <dig> and aΔctb2- <dig>  ectopic transformants from each wild type were selected and called fec  and aec .

the ahlburg wild type strain and the deletion mutants aΔctb2-1were selected for transformation with dsred resulting in more than  <dig> dsred fluorescent transformants of each strain. dsred reporter strains were obtained by transformation of c. beticola with pii99dsred  <cit> , which was linearized with xhoi. cbt <dig> deletion mutants transformed with dsred were pink because the red protein was visible in the white hyphae. a dsred ahlburg wild type strain expressing dsred  and aΔctb2- <dig> expressing dsred  was chosen for further analysis. growth rates and conidiation of the transformants were not changed.

Δctb <dig> transformants are reduced in pigmentation and toxin production
the gene disruption strains lost the characteristic dark pigmentation and appeared white, while the ectopic and wild type colonies were gray. other properties such as conidiation and growth rate remained unchanged .

the ahlburg isolate had a higher toxin content than the ferrara isolate , which may explain why ahlburg is the more virulent isolate. the Δctb <dig> strains from ahlburg and ferrara isolates did not produce cercosporin, whereas the toxin content of the ectopic ferrara transformant was identical to the wild type isolate . ahlburg ectopic transformant produced similar amounts of cercosporin as the wild type .

when in vitro-cultured sugar beets were treated with aqueous solution of cercosporin from pda plates, the plants dipped in wild type extract died after one day, while plants treated with the water control or the Δctb <dig> extract remained healthy and green . these experiments were repeated three times with five plants treated in each plate extract. culture extract from the gene disruption strain therefore lacks a key component needed to damage plant tissue.

ctb <dig> is important for pathogenicity of c. beticola
infection of 3-month-old sugar beets with the ahlburg and ferrara wild type and the corresponding disruptants aΔctb2- <dig> and aΔctb2- <dig> as well as fΔctb2- <dig> and fΔctb2- <dig> strains demonstrated that the Δctb <dig> strains of both isolates caused no lesions on the leaves, and the entire plants appeared healthy three weeks after infection. symptoms caused by the two disruptants of each wild type were indistinguishable . wild type strains of ahlburg and ferrara infected the plants and caused lesions. the ahlburg isolate proved to be highly aggressive causing severe leaf spot lesions comparing to the less virulent ferrara isolate causing only minor lesions . the symptoms caused by the ectopic transformants of ferrara and ahlburg were indistinguishable from the symptoms of the corresponding wild type strain, indicating that ctb <dig> is essential for pathogenicity of c. beticola .

disease rating was carried out by assessing the percentage of diseased leaf surface  <cit> . the disease rating  <dig> days after infection demonstrated that the plants infected with the gene disruption strain were symptom-free, while the plants infected with the ahlburg wild type strain had a disease index of  <dig> on a scale of  <dig>  whereas ferrara wild type and ectopic strains had a disease index of  <dig> .

occasionally, single lesions were observed on some leaves infected with the ahlburg Δctb <dig> strains  <dig> days after inoculation. the application of two different inoculation techniques showed that the appearance of the rare lesions depends on the quality of inoculum. a rough inoculum with clumps of mycelium, which was produced as described  <cit>  favored the appearance of lesions. however, the preparation of a fine spore suspension by filtering and sieving, as described in material and methods section, resulted only in very few necrotic spots after  <dig> days.

Δctb <dig> is impaired in penetration of host leaves
a histological analysis was performed to evaluate the infection process of the ahlburg wild type and the ahlburg Δctb2- <dig> strain at the cellular level. a constitutive expression of the dsred fluorescent reporter in ahlburg wild type and ahlburg disruptant facilitated the microscopic detection of fungal hyphae. c. beticola infection monitored by fluorescence microscopy showed a strong dsred fluorescence in the necrotic spots caused by the dsred wild type strain . the Δctb2- <dig> dsred strain did not cause leaf spots and the fluorescence was restricted to the hyphae on the leaf surface .

fluorescence microscopy of the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces showed germination and hyphal spread of the ahlburg wild type  and the gene disruption strain . the wild type strain was beginning to infect through the stomata at  <dig> days after infection  while the gene disruption strain did not penetrate the host tissue . cross sections of leaves at different stages of the infection revealed that the wild type had progressed intercellularly from the penetration site  and was beginning to cause necrosis  <dig> days after infection. the gene disruption strain stopped at the epidermis layer . the wild type spread massively inside the leaves until  <dig> days after infection , when large necrotic lesions became visible on the surface. the gene disruption strain had ceased to grow at this point and failed to spread inside the leaf .

discussion
despite progress in breeding and fungicide-mediated plant protection, understanding of the molecular interaction between c. beticola and sugar beet is just beginning. previous studies in c. nicotianae indicated that the disruption of several genes involved in toxin biosynthesis disabled cercosporin production and rendered the fungus nonpathogenic  <cit> . in the current study, we showed that the o-methyltransferase gene ctb <dig> is essential for cercosporin biosynthesis and fungal virulence of c. beticola. knock-out mutants  failed to produce cercosporin  and were nonpathogenic on sugar beet plants grown in the greenhouse or in vitro. the mutant strains lost the characteristic dark pigmentation.

the loss of grey pigmentation of the Δctb <dig> strains indicates that the disturbance of the cercosporin pathway may affect the formation of fungal pigments. mycelial pigments like melanin or bikaverin and fusarubins of fusarium fujikuroi <cit>  are synthesized by polyketide synthase gene clusters similar to the cercosporin biosynthesis gene cluster. analysis of Δctb <dig> mutants of c. nicotianea revealed that also transcripts of cnctb <dig>  cnctb <dig>  cnctb <dig> and cnctb <dig> are completely down regulated when cnctb <dig> was disrupted  <cit> . beside the involvement in cercosporin biosynthesis the cbctb <dig> protein or proteins targeted by a cbctb <dig> feedback inhibition could be involved in the biosynthesis of other fungal pigments. beside the essential role for cercosporin biosynthesis the knock-out of the o-methyltransferase gene ctb <dig> may therefore have a pleiotropic effect on c. beticola. a discoloration of the fungal mycelium was also described for the Δctb <dig> and Δctb <dig> mutants of c. nicotianae and explained by the absence of the red-colored cercosporin  <cit> .

weiland et al.  <cit>  performed site-directed knock-out experiments of cbctb <dig> in c. beticola, the polyketide synthase involved in cercosporin biosynthesis. two analyzed Δctb <dig> mutants did not produce cercosporin, yet the mutants were able to cause smaller and fewer lesions than the wild type. we observed that the Δctb <dig> strains also caused rarely necrotic spots, but the frequency of this spots was influenced by the quality of the inoculum. the more the infection technique corresponded to the natural infection condition; the lower was the number of necrosis.

plant pathogenic fungi must overcome the cell wall in order to enter the host plant, and have therefore developed very efficient and sophisticated mechanisms to breach that barrier. the mode of fungal penetration depends on their lifestyle; c. beticola has been shown to enter the host leaves without specific infection structures, invading through the stomata, followed by intercellular growth  <cit> .

our observations via fluorescence microscopy of reporter strains revealed that the ahlburg Δctb <dig> strain is unable to penetrate host tissue and establish an infection. although the mutant strain germinated well on the surface, maintained growth for several days, and in some cases was able to localize stomata, it failed to grow inside the leaves or to cause disease symptoms, indicating that cercosporin is necessary for tissue colonization during early stages of infection by c. beticola. the involvement of cercosporin in the early infection phase of c. beticola is unexpected. earlier studies revealed that purified cercosporin caused necrotic spots on sugar beet leaves that were similar in size and ultrastructural composition to the lesions caused by c. beticola <cit> . therefore, it was hypothesized that cercosporin’s major contribution was to cause the extensive blighting symptoms characteristic of many cercospora diseases. after penetration through the stomata and colonization, the membrane-damaging toxin should allow cell breakdown and leakage of nutrients for fungal growth and sporulation  <cit> .

the failure of the ctb2-deficient strains to penetrate and colonize leaf tissue raises questions regarding the role of cercosporin in the biotrophic phase of infection. transcriptome analysis of more than  <dig>  sugar beet cdnas demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of defense reactions in the early to mid stages of c. beticola infection is suppressed in polygenic resistant or susceptible genotypes  <cit> . c. beticola has obviously developed a strategy to dampen the immunity triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns . in the case of the c. beticola–sugar beet interaction, the suppression of phenylalanine-ammonium lyase and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase have been described in detail  <cit> . the repression of phenylalanine-ammonium lyase gene expression was induced by c. beticola production of phytohormone abscisic acid during the early phase of infection  <cit> .

it is interesting to speculate that cercosporin may be involved in the suppression of plant defense reactions. as a prerequisite for this model, the toxin must be present in the early phase of infection and easily accessible to the plant cells. since the biosynthesis of cercosporin is light-regulated  <cit> , it can be assumed that the germinating spores and growing hyphae of c. beticola are already producing the toxin on the surface of the epidermis. furthermore, cercosporin is a lipid-soluble molecule that penetrates rapidly into host cell membranes  <cit>  and can interact with membrane-embedded molecules such as receptors or transporters. however, additional experiments are necessary to demonstrate a direct role of cercosporin in the repression of plant defense mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we disrupted the cbctb <dig> gene coding for an o-methyltransferase thereby eliminating toxin production. the resultant mutants were not only unable to produce the toxin, but failed to infect sugar beet leaves. cercosporin deficient mutants grow on the leaf surface but were unable to invade and colonize sugar beet leaves. previously, it was hypothesized that cercosporin is involved in tissue damage after initial penetration and colonization. here we show that cercosporin plays also a role in the initial biotrophic phase of the pathogen. recent results showed that cercospora beticola represses transcriptional activation of plant defense pathways. we assume that cercosporin is important for suppressing these defense reactions which are otherwise triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns. thereby, cercosporin enables the pathogen to successfully infect its host plant.
