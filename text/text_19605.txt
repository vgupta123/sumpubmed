BACKGROUND
in canine medicine, a limited number of laboratory markers for the detection or monitoring of localised  or systemic inflammation exists  <cit> . the diagnosis of canine inflammatory bowel disease , for example, often poses challenges for the veterinarian and relies on the exclusion of other diagnoses and the histopathological evaluation of intestinal mucosal biopsies  <cit> . in addition, neither clinical signs nor clinicopathological markers allow the clinician to predict whether a dog with chronic idiopathic ibd will respond to a change in diet alone, to antibiotics or to corticosteroids  <cit> . thus, objective biomarkers may help to simplify diagnosis and possibly predict the most appropriate treatment approach in canine ibd.

s100a <dig>  belongs to the s100/calgranulin-protein family and represents a useful inflammatory marker in human patients with inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , respiratory disease  <cit>  and ibd . s100a <dig> is mostly expressed and secreted by activated phagocytes  <cit>  and, at lower levels, by keratinocytes  <cit> , monocytes  <cit>  and eosinophils  <cit> . s100a <dig> plays a role in intracellular homeostasis and possesses extracellular functions, including chemotaxis, proinflammatory cytokine production, sustained recruitment of leukocytes and induction of oxidative stress . increased s100a <dig> concentrations were found in the stool samples, serum and intestinal mucosa in human patients with ibd . recently, canine s100a <dig> was purified  <cit> , and a radioimmunoassay was developed and analytically validated for its quantification in serum and faecal  <cit>  and urine samples from dogs  <cit> . furthermore, an s100a <dig> concentration was recently measured as a non-invasive marker in the faeces of dogs with and without ibd using the elisa method  <cit> . that study showed that dogs with ibd have higher faecal s100a <dig> concentrations than healthy dogs. however, when measuring only the faecal s100a <dig> concentration, it is impossible to know from which part of the intestine they originate. given the various roles of s100a <dig>  it is reasonable to consider this protein’s function in the intestinal mucosa during inflammation.

myeloperoxidase  is an enzyme found mostly in neutrophils as well as at lower concentrations in monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . it plays a major role in intracellular microbial destruction, but, at inflammatory sites, it is released into the extracellular space after phagocyte activation and induces damage to the host tissue  <cit> . increased intestinal tissue levels of mpo as a biomarker of oxidative stress were found in the animal models of ibd  and in both forms of human ibd  . this finding raises the question of whether mucosal mpo activity may also be associated with canine ibd. in canine ibd, the predominant inflammatory cells are thought to be lymphocytes and plasma cells. however, german et al. also found a significant increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in dogs with antibiotic-responsive diarrhoea and in dogs with ibd when compared to healthy controls  <cit> . to our knowledge, no reports of s100a <dig> and mpo levels in intestinal mucosal samples from healthy dogs or dogs with ibd exist.

to initiate research on this aspect of canine intestinal inflammation, our study aimed to determine the mucosal s100a <dig> and mpo levels in different parts of the intestine in  <dig> healthy laboratory beagle dogs. the results of this study provide the basis for future studies regarding the role of mucosal s100a <dig> and mpo as inflammatory biomarkers in the pathogenesis of canine chronic enteropathies, including ibd.

RESULTS
histological examination
based on the histological examination of the intestine, the median total wsava score of all samples was  <dig> , classifying all findings as normal. we found no histological abnormalities in the submucosa, the muscularis externa or the serosa in any of the samples.

s100a <dig> concentrations in the intestinal mucosa
the s100a <dig> concentration in all samples ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/l. in the four different parts of the intestine examined in  <dig> healthy dogs, the highest median levels of s100a <dig>  which were significant, were found in the ileum , followed by the colon , duodenum  and jejunum  . in addition, the difference between the colonic and jejunal mucosa was significant .table  <dig> distribution of the s100a <dig> concentrations and mpo activities in the intestinal mucosal samples of  <dig> healthy dogs

analytical validation of the mpo method and mpo activity in the intestinal mucosa
the intra-assay coefficients of variation  in six different small intestinal mucosa samples assayed in a 1: <dig> dilution were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, and were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in six different large intestinal mucosa samples tested in a 1: <dig> dilution. the inter-assay cv % for six different small intestinal and six different large intestinal mucosa samples assayed in a 1: <dig> dilution were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %.

the observed to expected ratios  at dilutions of 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  1: <dig> and 1: <dig> ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %  for six different small intestinal mucosa samples, and from 84– <dig>  %  for six different large intestinal mucosa samples. o/e for the spiking recovery ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %  for five different small intestinal mucosa samples, and from  <dig> – <dig>  %  for five different large intestinal mucosa samples.

the mpo enzyme activity was determined in all mucosal samples from four different intestinal areas of  <dig> healthy beagles. the median mpo activity was significantly higher in the ileum , jejunum  and duodenum  than in the colon   . in addition, the difference between the jejunal and duodenal mucosa was significant  .fig.  <dig> boxplot representing the log-transformed mpo activities in the intestinal mucosal samples of  <dig> healthy dogs. the horizontal line inside each box represents the median; the top and bottom of each box represent the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively; and the whiskers represent the 95th and 5th percentiles. *

discussion
this study aimed to determine the concentration of s100a <dig> and the activity of mpo in four different parts of the intestine in healthy beagles by using elisa and a spectrophotometric method, respectively. the elisa method was validated as capable of determining s100a <dig> in the faecal samples of healthy dogs  <cit>  and dogs with ibd  <cit> , but to the best of our knowledge not in canine intestinal mucosal extracts. in this study, we successfully established and validated for the first time a spectrophotometric method to measure mpo activity in the intestinal mucosa in healthy dogs.

according to the literature, the interpretation of gastrointestinal histopathological findings may vary widely between pathologists even with standardised grading schemes  <cit> . despite using a pictorial template, willard et al. found poor agreement between pathologists evaluating the number of duodenal neutrophils in dogs and cats when using a four-point scale   <cit> . hence, applying objective biomarkers may overcome this problem. s100a <dig> and mpo are exclusively expressed in relevant amounts by granulocytes, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of ibd in humans  <cit> .

elevated intestinal mucosal concentrations of s100a <dig> were found in human patients with ibd. when secreted extracellularly, s100a <dig> contributes to innate immune responses and activates intracellular signalling cascades leading to cytokine production and the induction of oxidative stress in ibd patients  <cit> . in the present study, s100a <dig> concentrations were higher in extracts from the ileum than in other segments of the intestine. s100a <dig> detection in the intestinal mucosa may reflect the number of neutrophils infiltrating the mucosa. because of poor agreement between pathologists evaluating the number of duodenal neutrophils  <cit> , we did not attempt to perform neutrophil count comparisons between the different intestinal sections. therefore, we assume that the higher s100a <dig> concentrations in the ileum may be due to the high number of s100a12-expressing cells  within the ileal mucosa. heilmann et al. reported variations in the faecal concentrations of s100a <dig> in healthy dogs  <cit> . an irregular distribution of s100a12-expressing cells within the gastrointestinal mucosa or variation in the concentration of faecal proteins due to variations in the gastrointestinal passage were suggested as possible reasons for this variation  <cit> . moreover, heilmann et al. reported a similar variation in other faecal markers in healthy dogs  <cit> . in our study, the s100a <dig> concentration in all mucosal extracts ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/l. similar variations in the s100a <dig> concentration were reported for normal duodenal and cecal mucosal biopsies in humans  <cit> . in a study by leach et al., the s100a <dig> concentration ranged from 7–36 μg/l in the culture supernatants of duodenal and cecal mucosal biopsies obtained from  <dig> non-ibd control children  <cit> . duodenal and cecal biopsies were also cultured and supernatants were collected for the determination of s100a <dig> using the elisa method. a similar variation was also found in the concentration of calprotectin, another member of the s100/calgranulin protein family, ranging from 16–511 μg/l in the culture supernatants of duodenal and cecal mucosal biopsies  <cit> .

mpo is an enzyme found predominantly in neutrophils and in lower concentrations in monocytes and macrophages. the quantification of mpo is well established for the evaluation of intestinal inflammation in humans and animal models of ibd . the number of neutrophils and consequently mpo enzyme activity increase in inflammatory conditions such as human and animal models of ibd . previously, mpo-derived hypochlorous acid  was shown to affect oxidative tissue damage in human ibd  <cit> . in our study, mpo activities were higher in the ileal, jejunal and duodenal mucosa than in the colonic mucosa of healthy dogs. moreover, its concentration was higher in the jejunum than in the duodenum. the detection of mpo in the intestinal mucosa could reflect the number of granulocytes infiltrating the mucosa. variations in the mpo activity in our study in different parts of the intestine in healthy dogs could be explained by the disparity in the distribution of mpo-releasing cells, such as the neutrophils and macrophages. several studies investigated the distribution of immune cells in the intestines of healthy dogs and cats . however, the results did not allow for conclusions concerning the distribution of mpo, since the distribution of neutrophils as the primary source of mpo was not studied. macrophages, as a possible source of mpo, were detected using the antibody mac <dig> in two studies of the intestines of normal cats  <cit>  and dogs  <cit> . the authors concluded that the number of mac <dig> positive cells was higher in the ileum than in other segments of the intestine. however, to our knowledge, no study addressing the distribution of the mpo enzyme in different parts of the normal intestinal mucosa of dogs or any other species exists.

considering the lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific biomarkers for canine ibd, identifying such a marker would substantially improve diagnosis and disease monitoring, and may potentially lead to a significant improvement in patient care and quality of life. faecal and serum calprotectin, as a non-invasive biomarker, was found to increase in dogs with ibd  <cit> . in another study, faecal concentrations of calprotectin were significantly higher in dogs with chronic diarrhoea than in healthy control dogs  <cit> . furthermore, faecal s100a <dig> concentrations were higher in dogs with ibd  <cit> . whilst using non-invasive biomarkers is more appropriate in determining the presence of gut inflammation, it is impossible to correlate faecal s100a <dig> with certain histological subtypes of ibd , since the specific type causing an increase and to what degree remain unknown. in addition, measuring the faecal s100a <dig> concentration does not allow for the assessment of the specific part of the intestine from which the s100a <dig> sample originates. in our opinion, knowing which part of the intestine has the highest level of s100a <dig> is important as a possible means for differentiating canine ibd subtypes. faecal s100a <dig> may be valuable for screening dogs suspected of having ibd and for monitoring disease activity, thus reducing the need for endoscopy during disease follow-up. increases in faecal s100a <dig> are, therefore, viewed as indicative of endoscopy, rather than being used as an alternative to endoscopy for diagnosis  <cit> . in our study, we validated laboratory methods to determine the biomarkers in tissues from their proposed origin. both mucosal s100a <dig> and mpo may be valuable markers complementing invasive diagnostic measures when used in combination with intestinal mucosal histology. this is an important basis for the study of the role of such markers in different types of canine ibd. to our knowledge, studies determining s100a <dig> and mpo in intestinal mucosal samples from dogs suffering from ibd remain unreported.

extensive descriptions exist of the presence of increased levels of both s100a <dig> and mpo in ibd patients in humans . ileal and colonic mucosal s100a <dig> concentrations distinguished active ibd human subjects from healthy controls with a high sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . in another study, s100a <dig> concentrations in duodenal and cecal mucosal samples were significantly higher in children with ibd compared with non-ibd controls  <cit> . foell et al. found a significant correlation between ileal and colonic mucosal s100a <dig> concentrations and intestinal tissue inflammation  <cit> . in addition, a significant correlation was also found between faecal and serum s100a <dig> concentrations and disease activity index in adults  <cit>  with cd and uc. therefore, some researchers concluded that s100a <dig> is a suitable non-invasive marker for monitoring disease activity  <cit>  and predicting disease relapse both in cd and uc  <cit> .

studies of the correlation between s100a <dig> and the paediatric crohn’s disease activity index  in children presented conflicting results. whilst most studies report no correlation  <cit> , de jong et al. found a significant correlation in children with crohn’s disease  <cit> . heilmann et al. reported similar findings in dogs with ibd, finding a significant correlation between faecal s100a <dig> and the canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index   <cit> . such studies need, however, to take into consideration that both pcdai and ccecai include a number of subjective elements, and consequently do not always represent the actual inflammatory burden, possibly leading to disagreements between results from different studies.

faecal myeloperoxidase levels were also significantly correlated with histological indices of disease activity in uc  <cit> . in addition, wagner et al. showed that normalised faecal mpo levels could be used to predict a complete clinical response to treatment among patients with cd or uc  <cit> .

whether s100a <dig> and mpo are also involved in the pathogenesis of canine ibd remains unknown and requires further investigation. in the current study, we aimed to provide basic data for the determination of s100a <dig> concentrations and mpo activities in the intestinal mucosa of healthy dogs. our study forms the basis for on-going clinical trials comparing s100a <dig> and mpo in subtypes of ibd. in future studies, immunohistochemistry should also be included to assess the localisation of s100a <dig> and mpo in canine intestinal mucosa and their association with intestinal pathologies in dogs.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we determined the concentrations of s100a <dig> and mpo in intestinal mucosa samples from healthy dogs in this study, laying the groundwork for future studies in canine chronic intestinal diseases, including ibd. both mucosal biomarkers may play a role in the initial detection of gut inflammation leading to further investigations confirming ibd or to differentiating between ibd subtypes. understanding the role of s100a <dig> and mpo in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation in future and evaluating their use as biomarkers to distinguish between dogs with idiopathic ibd versus healthy dogs or dogs with food-responsive diarrhoea, antimicrobial-responsive diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal diseases may provide the possibility of improving our understanding of canine chronic intestinal inflammation and the current treatment approach.
