BACKGROUND
cellular organisms in the contemporary living world have been classified into superkingdoms archaea, bacteria, and eukarya  <cit>  ever since archaebacteria were discovered over three decades ago  <cit> . every newly recorded species of the over a million that have been described  has failed to escape from the boundary of the three-superkingdom natural system. this system confers a rigid universal taxonomic structure for a universal 'tree of life', a phylogeny that describes how lineages on earth diversified from a primordial ancestor. in phylogenetics, the most basal and ancient  node of an evolutionary tree defines a common ancestor of the organismal set  under study. generally, this node is a hypothetical entity, the first of a chain of ancestors giving rise to each and every organism in the tree. the tree of life defines the last universal common ancestor , an organism responsible for the emergence of earth's primary lineages  <cit> . however, the current tree of life is not universal, i.e. not all primary lineages are represented in the tree. the tree describes the evolution of organisms with ribosome-containing cells  and does not incorporate viruses or other lineages that lack ribosomes , have biological boundaries that are difficult to define, or are evolutionarily highly mobile  <cit> . the tree of life may also have reticulations because of horizontal gene transfer , convergent evolution, and recruitment processes that complicate the genetic make up of lineages. while the terms "network" or "rhizome" have been proposed, reticulations often affect the history of organismal components but maintain the integrity of lineages  <cit> , and all lineages most probably had a single evolutionary origin  <cit> . luca is believed to be a cellular entity, even though its make up has been considered contentious  <cit> . its cellular status was probably attained progressively, starting with molecular components drawn from the emerging and fuzzy biochemistry of primordial earth and ending with more complex biological machinery needed to sustain the integrity of lineages in an increasingly diversified world. in particular, cell-defining ribosomes evolved from the start as ribonucleoprotein ensembles  <cit>  but emerged before the loss of the first protein fold in a superkingdom  <dig>  billion years  ago, a first indication of clear organism diversification  <cit> . conceptually, the primordial ancestor by definition cannot represent a formal lineage; no prior phylogenetic ancestor precedes it, being first and last of a gradually evolving community of primordial organisms. consequently, we regard this primordial ancestral entity as the most basal node of the tree of life and name it for simplicity the 'urancestor' , a primitive organism that evolved in a time when improving the molecular make up was the main focus of the evolutionary progression.

the emergence of the urancestor probably represents a singular evolutionary chain of events responsible for the universal genetic code and widely shared biological structure. however, defining the complexity  of its molecular features  is problematic, as it often depends on the levels of molecular structure analyzed , the rooting of the tree of life, and the methods used for ancestral character state reconstruction. while it is likely that the urancestor had functional ribosomal rna  and some transfer rna  molecules  <cit> , as revealed by phylogenetic analysis of rna and protein structure  <cit> ), and was probably endowed with functions associated with dna replication  <cit> , its translational apparatus has been considered to be rudimentary  <cit> . penny and poole  <cit>  later on expanded urancestral complexity to include besides translation and dna replication, transcription, cell division, and regulatory elements of information processing, suggesting a functionally complex entity much akin to that of modern life. comparative genomic studies that included the first archaeal genome that was sequenced, methanococcus jannaschii, resulted in arguable conclusions  <cit> . broader comparative analyses of entire genomic repertoires were still inconclusive, supporting the simple 'progenote' model proposed by woese  <cit>  or the complex 'cenancestor'  model that equated the urancestor to modern organisms  <cit> . for example, koonin  <cit>  traced evolutionary histories of orthologous genes in ~ <dig> genomes using parsimony thinking and phylogenetic trees of ribosomal proteins and rrna. although the numbers of urancestral genes ranged from tens to ~ <dig>  depending on composite parameter values of rates of differential hgt and gene loss, the gene set included most of the translation apparatus and a few transcriptional components but lacked dna replication regardless of parametric values. in contrast, ouzounis and colleagues initially identified ~ <dig> ancient proteins from homologues of m. jannaschii open reading frames  <cit> . except for regulatory elements related to information , proteins encompassed penny and poole's urancestral functions. a more recent study of  <dig> genomes identified  <dig> orthologous protein families, which cover  <dig> detailed functional classes that are involved in almost all essential biological processes of extant life, including translation, transcription and its regulation, dna replication, recombination, and repair, transport and membrane-associated functions, electron transfer, and metabolism  <cit> . similarly, comparison of protein fold structures among lineages of the three superkingdoms supported an urancestor with functional complexity similar to that of extant life  <cit> .

mutation and chromosomal rearrangement change the sequence of nucleic acids and proteins continuously. the high pace of sequence change can complicate phylogenetic analysis and character state reconstruction. differential evolutionary rates among organismal lineages, horizontal gene transfer , and non-orthologous gene displacement can generate phylogenetic artifacts such as long-branch attraction and unrecognized paralogy  <cit> . this compounds with difficulty in identifying homology by sequence alignment  <cit> , the troublesome task of assigning orthologous relationships  <cit> , and the problem of saturation of substitutions  <cit> . these phylogenetic artifacts can be responsible for the variable rootings of the tree of life. finally, origins of genes can be highly variable depending on reference trees that are used for tracing their evolutionary histories. except for a couple of studies  <cit> , all surveys of urancestral molecular repertoires that were fully based on sequence conservation must be considered susceptible to these problems.

in this study we focus on the three-dimensional  structure of protein domains that result from the folding of polypeptide chains. these structures are grouped into fold families , fold superfamilies , and folds  in a robust hierarchical classification scheme, the structural classification of proteins  <cit> . in particular, we focus on fsfs, groups of ffs  that share structural and functional features suggestive of a common evolutionary origin. scop currently defines ~ <dig>  fsfs, and ~ <dig> Ã—  <dig> proteins present in ~ <dig>  completely sequenced genomes  <cit>  have been assigned to at least one fsf by scanning with hidden markov models  <cit> . the relatively small number of ffs, fsfs, and fs present in nature indicates protein structure is much more conserved than sequence and is refractory to evolutionary change  <cit> . in fact, a comparative analysis of structurally aligned protein domains and aligned protein sequences showed structures are 3- <dig> times more conserved than sequences  <cit> . the structures are therefore good phylogenetic markers for deep events in evolutionary history. the large and growing number of genomic sequences and their associated fsf assignments also guarantees a broad organismal census. moreover, the evolutionary conservation and deep phylogenetic signal of fsfs has been repeatedly verified by recovery of reliable phyletic patterns describing the evolution of the three superkingdoms  <cit>  and by successful exploration of the origin of modern metabolic networks  <cit> . all of these features and the fact that domains diversify mostly by vertical descent  <cit>  make domain structure extremely useful for the evolutionary study of proteomes and urancestral protein repertoires.

here we build a tree of life using a census of fsf domains in  <dig> free-living  proteomes and employ an iterative strategy to reconstruct the urancestral proteome . initially, fsfs that are placed in the root branch of the tree are assigned to the urancestor. we reason that fsfs that appear after the division of the three superkingdoms must be absent in a non-diversified organismal world. we therefore exclude fsfs of relatively recent age iteratively, using fsfs in the root branch of an initial proteome tree as phylogenetic characters for reconstructing a new tree. the procedure identifies a set of urancestral fsfs that is shielded from the so-called 'modern effect', the impact of recent convergent evolutionary processes on ancient repertoires  <cit> . finally, biological functions associated with upper and lower bounds of an urancestral proteome are annotated using a coarse-grained functional classification of fsfs  <cit> . this information served to define the molecular functions and biological processes of the primordial ancestor of diversified life and allowed to time the actual appearance of this elusive but crucial ancestral entity.

RESULTS
genomic census and reconstruction of a tree of life
in this study we conducted a genomic census of protein domains at fsf level of structural complexity in organisms that have been completely sequenced and used this information to build trees of life describing the evolution of proteomes. we first analyzed  <dig> complete proteomes in  <dig> archaeal,  <dig> bacterial, and  <dig> eukaryotic species . using an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  we extracted reliable proteomic hmm hits for  <dig>  fsfs,  <dig>  of which covered ca. 80% of the total fsfs defined in scop. we then generated intrinsically rooted phylogenomic trees directly from fsf abundances in the  <dig> proteomes. a most parsimonious reconstruction of a tree of life  showed that organisms in the three superkingdoms formed distinct groups . eukaryotic proteomes were placed in a monophyletic group that was supported by a 50% bootstrap support  value. in turn, archaeal and bacterial proteomes were para- and polyphyletically grouped, respectively. a manual analysis of organismal lifestyles using various sources of information revealed that proteomes from obligate and non-obligate parasitic organisms  were distributed throughout the tree but generally occupied the most ancient branches of the superkingdom groups . basal organisms included notable obligate parasites .

the genomes of organisms that are parasitic or that establish symbiotic relationships with other organisms have frequently experienced reductive evolution, discarding enzymatic and cellular machineries in exchange for resources from their hosts. since the inclusion of these genomes can lead to incorrect phylogenetic trees  <cit> , we excluded genomes from all but  <dig> fl organisms. this fl set included  <dig> archaeal,  <dig> bacterial, and  <dig> eukaryotic organisms. the exclusion of non-fl genomes resulted in  <dig> fsfs that were absent in the proteomes of fl organisms. we therefore reconstructed a most parsimonious rooted tree that described the evolution of fl organisms from genomic abundances of the remaining  <dig>  fsf. the tree of fl proteomes  also supported the trichotomy of the superkingdoms . unlike the total-tree, the fl-tree showed that archaeal species formed a polyphyletic group and were basal in the tree. the proteomes of bacteria and eukarya formed strong monophyletic groups supported by  <dig> and 100% bs values, respectively. a sister-clade relationship between bacteria and eukarya existed but was poorly supported . while statistics describing the skewness  <cit>  of the total-tree were close to zero , the fl-tree had more significant phylogenetic structure . our focus therefore centered on fl-tree reconstructions.

in the fl-tree, the number of bacterial proteomes dominates those of organisms in other superkingdoms. it is thus possible to argue that the bias of sampled proteomes per superkingdom can cause long-branch attraction, which can eventually lead to incorrect deep phylogenetic relationships. we thus sampled equal numbers of proteomes per superkingdom and replicated trees of proteomes. we first chose only one proteome per genus in archaea because the numbers of proteomes vary depending on individual archaeal genera. as a result, we selected  <dig> out of  <dig> archaeal proteomes. we then classified bacterial and eukaryal proteomes at the phylum level of the two superkingdoms. while some phyla contained large number of proteomes , some other contained very few . we thus randomly sampled bacterial and eukaryal proteomes whose numbers are proportional to the size of corresponding phyla and then adjusted the number of sampled proteomes per superkingdom to the sample size of archaea . by following the same steps described in methods, the genomic abundances of  <dig>  fsfs in the balanced set of  <dig> proteomes resulted in one most parsimonious tree . the phylogenetic relationships among the three superkingdoms that we found in the fl-tree of  <dig> proteomes  were consistently present in the newly reconstructed tree . furthermore, monophyly of bacteria and eukarya, and paraphyly of archaea were maintained. these results indicate our phylogenetic approach based on genomic abundance is robust against uneven sampling of proteomes in superkingdoms.

iterative refinement to identify urancestral fsfs
we traced gains and losses  of characters  along the branches of the fl-tree using the apolist option in paup*  <cit> . a set of  <dig> plesiomorphic fsf characters  was positioned at the root branch. most fsfs in the 352_set were present in the three superkingdoms . these ancient fsfs exhibited only gains  and were assigned as initial set of characters to each of  <dig> different iterative chains to define the set of urancestral fsfs. in individual chains, fsfs that are positioned at the root branch of the xth proteome tree were used as character set for building the th proteome tree, where the iteration number x ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  all of the proteome trees that were generated during the iterations showed absence of loss of fsfs in their root branches. the numbers of distinct fsfs and tree lengths decreased dramatically in early iterations of all the chains, especially before iteration  <dig>  and converged to values with little variance . some of the iterations produced two or more equally parsimonious trees. the numbers of plesiomorphic fsfs and tree lengths for over  <dig>  most parsimonious trees that were retained ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  steps, respectively. the minimal set of  <dig> fsfs was observed in  <dig> iterations of four different chains . however, one most parsimonious tree  belonged to the set of trees that generated the smallest number of the fsfs .

in general, some of character-state changes on a given phylogenetic tree can be ambiguous. that is, these changes can occur on different branches without increase or decrease in the number of steps of the tree. in the root branch of the fl-tree,  <dig> out of the  <dig> fsfs had character-state changes that were ambiguously assigned. however, the ambiguity sharply decreased in the early iterations of every chain as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  consequently, all of the  <dig> fsfs that were obtained from iteration  <dig> onwards of chain  <dig> had purely unambiguous character-state changes.

to remove fsfs that might be derived from ancient hgt or convergent evolutionary processes, we used information in a rooted tree of domain structure that describes the evolution of  <dig>  fsfs  and was reconstructed from fsf abundance in the proteomes of  <dig> fl organisms . in this tree, the most basal  <dig> fsfs were present in the three superkingdoms and appeared before the rise of the first fsf that was completely lost in a superkingdom  . the intersection of this ancient set of  <dig> fsfs with the set of  <dig> fsfs defined  <dig> urancestral fsfs. iteration analysis of this new urancestral fsf set with the same numbers of chains and iterations showed there was no further decrease in the number of fsfs, although tree lengths varied slightly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  steps. we therefore define the sets of  <dig> and  <dig> urancestral fsfs as the maximum  and minimum  boundaries of the urancestral fsf repertoire, respectively. the biological rationale for the use of the iterative analysis and the tree of domain structures can be found in discussion.

taxonomic distribution of urancestral fsfs
under the 3-superkingdom taxonomic system, an individual fsf can be unique to superkingdom archaea , bacteria  or eukarya , or can be shared by two  or all three superkingdoms . the initial 352_set of fsfs that were basal and plesiomorphic consisted of  <dig> abe,  <dig> ab,  <dig> ae, and  <dig> a fsf . as expected, the max_set of  <dig> urancestral fsfs  had only abe domains. to describe the popularity of urancestral fsfs in proteomes, we adopted two different indexes:  a distribution index f, the fraction of organisms that contain a certain fsf ; and  the mean of g, the sum of g values of all sampled proteomes for a particular fsf divided by the total number of proteomes. the 352_set had f and mean of g values that ranged  <dig> - <dig> and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively . the max_set has corresponding values that ranged  <dig> - <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  and the min_set had values that ranged  <dig> - <dig> and  <dig> - <dig> . clearly, min_set fsfs are ubiquitous and highly represented in proteomes.

fsf architectures and functions of minimum and maximum urancestral sets
for each fsf that belongs to the 352_set, the max_set, and the min_set, we tabulated molecular functions defined by scop coarse-grained functional classification, mean of g and f indices, and superkingdoms distribution in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  since it is difficult to describe the urancestor based on fsf structural and functional information, we grouped urancestral fsfs within seven major categories and  <dig> sub-categories of functions. to avoid confusion, category names are displayed in italics and the initial letters are capitalized . while all seven major categories were present in the 352_set, the max_set of urancestral fsfs involved six  and the min_set involved only five  . the fsfs of the three sets were distributed in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sub-categories, respectively . for general, both the max_set and the min_set had five fsfs that belong to sub-categories protein interaction and small molecule binding while the 352_set had  <dig> fsfs with additional functions related to binding activities . for information, the profile of sub-categories for the max_set was identical to that for the 352_set, although the former set had fewer fsfs than the latter for individual sub-categories . the functions of the max_set encompassed dna replication/repair, translation, transcription, and rna processing, where the last two categories were absent in the min_set. in the three sets, the nuclear structure and chromatin structure functions essential for developing the eukaryotic cell were absent. for metabolism, the fsfs of the three sets were commonly distributed in coenzyme m/tr, amino acids m/tr, other enzymes, carbohydrate m/tr, transferases, polysaccharide m/tr, redox, secondary metabolism, energy, and storage, where 'm/tr' means metabolism and transport . fsfs that function in photosynthesis and cell envelope m/tr were completely absent in all of the sets. while few fsfs of electron transfer, nitrogen m/tr, and lipid m/tr were present in the 352_set, they were absent in both the urancestral max_set and min_set. for intra-cellular processes, subcategories protein modification, transport, proteases, and ion m/tr were shown by all of the sets while cell cycle related to apoptosis, phospholipid m/tr, cell motility, and trafficking/secretion were absent in all. only one fsf of the extra-cellular processes category was present in the 352_set and belonged to sub-category cell adhesion . for regulation, min_set fsfs were kinases/phosphatases and dna-binding and max_set fsfs were additionally involved in receptor activity and other regulatory functions. the sub-category signal transduction was present in the 352_set, but not in the max_set and the min_set. five and  <dig> fsfs that are grouped into unknown function of category other were assigned to the max_set and the 352_set, respectively. two fsfs in the 352_set were not annotated in sub-categories and are labeled nona in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

comparing the functions of urancestral fsf sets and extant proteomes
the functional repertoire of urancestral fsfs was compared to that of the set of  <dig>  fsfs that are present in the  <dig> extant fl proteomes we analyzed. since  <dig> fsfs were not annotated, the remaining  <dig>  fsfs were used as a the reference  set and included  <dig> fsfs in general,  <dig> in information,  <dig> in metabolism,  <dig> in intra-cellular processes,  <dig> in extra-cellular processes,  <dig> in regulation, and  <dig> in other. less than 10% of these fsfs were present in the urancestral min_set . with the exception of fsfs linked to information , less than 15% of extant fsfs in the remaining categories were present in the urancestral max_set. within the min_set and max_set, metabolism was the most abundant . however, while the most abundant category of the min_set was metabolism, information was prevalent in the max_set . to examine which sub-functional categories were enriched in the urancestral sets, we conducted a statistical test for each of them based on the hypergeometric distribution . the analysis revealed that three and two categories were enriched in the min_set and the max_set with more than 95% confidence level, respectively . the enrichment of nucleotide m/tr of the category metabolism was supported by both of the urancestral sets. in turn, small molecule binding of general and transferases of metabolism were uniquely enriched in the min_set, and translation of information was enriched only by the max_set.

we evaluated which of  <dig> sub-categories are enriched by the min_set or the max_set. in the table, sample means the min_set  or max_set . the  <dig>  fsfs represent the background . for convenience, let us assume that m and k represent the number of fsfs that are assigned to a particular sub-category in the background  and sample  and n and n are the total numbers of fsfs in the background and sample without functional categorizations. the rates for the sample and the background are notated by k/n and m/n, respectively. the ratio was determined by dividing the sample rate by the background rate. the p values were calculated using the hypergeometric distribution. the enrichment of the sub-categories that are listed was supported at the 95% confidence level.

structural complexity of the urancestor
in order to determine if urancestral fsf sets were simpler in number than fsfs of extant organisms, we checked the number of distinct fsfs  for each of the  <dig> fl proteomes sampled . the numbers of distinct fsf ranged from  <dig> in staphylothermus marinus  to  <dig> fsfs in capitella sp. . proteomic occurrence levels of extant fsfs showed that over  <dig> additional fsfs are necessary in urancestral fsf sets to account for the complexity of the simplest organism in existence today.

we also compared the abundance of urancestral fsfs  to that of extant organisms . while it is difficult to infer multiple appearances of individual fsfs in organisms before the advent of the three superkingdoms, proteome trees were generated from fsf abundance levels  and provide histories of character state changes for individual characters . we therefore counted how many gains or losses of individual urancestral fsfs occurred in the root branches of the trees. in the process of identifying the two urancestral fsf sets, we obtained most parsimonious trees of proteomes in iterations that generated the  <dig> and  <dig> fsf sets. in these trees, min_set and max_set fsfs appeared  <dig> and  <dig> times without any event of loss, respectively. using a similar rationale, we counted gains and losses of fsfs in individual proteomic lineages by traveling from the root to terminal leaves of the proteome tree. total abundance levels for fsfs in each of the  <dig> fl proteomes  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the proteome that had the lowest total abundance level was ignicoccus hospitalis, a chemolithoautotrophic and hyperthermophilic archaeon . as expected, the fsf abundance levels of the urancestral sets were simpler than those of any fl proteome in existence today.

to strengthen the quantitative results presented above, we reconstructed trees of proteomes that included the urancestral proteomes as taxa. these trees illustrate the evolution of the  <dig> fl organisms and that of the urancestor if this entity existed today. we defined the two urancestral fsf sets as artificial proteomes and assigned character states  to abundance levels of urancestral fsfs. because character states represent maximum transformed g values, the urancestor had maximum abundance levels for the given urancestral fsfs. on the other hand, we assigned '0' to the fsfs that were not present in the urancestral sets. each of the urancestral proteomes was separately added to the matrix of  <dig>  fsfs and  <dig> fl proteomes, and proteome trees were reconstructed that included the min_set and max_set urancestor . in both cases, the artificial urancestral proteomes  appeared at the base of the trees supported by 94% bs levels, and were basal to the most basal archaeal proteomes in the tree. furthermore, over  <dig>  character-state changes explicitly discriminate the artificial urancestors from other fl proteomes as shown in the sub-trees that displays the  <dig> most ancient taxa .

functional complexity of the urancestor
in order to determine if the functions of the urancestor were simpler than of extant proteomes, we extracted fsfs from each of the  <dig> fl proteomes examined and assigned coarse-grained functional sub-categories to them. their number ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the simplest functional profile was that of the simplest methanogenic archaeon, methanosphaera stadtmanae, and the most complex functional profile was exhibited by a set of  <dig> eukaryotic proteomes. as already described, the functions of fsfs in the min_set and the max_set were classified into  <dig> and  <dig> distinct functional categories, respectively. consequently, the upper bound urancestral fsf set lacked  <dig> functional sub-categories when compared to the functions of the simplest fl organism.

using a strategy similar to the one described above for domain structure, we again regarded the two urancestral fsf sets as taxa and evaluated their phylogenomic positions on the proteome trees. inspired by a recent phylogenomic analysis of molecular functions that was derived directly from ontological data  <cit> , we defined the  <dig> functional sub-categories as phylogenetic characters and calculated individual g values for fsfs pooled by function. characters in this analysis have character states that describe the number of distinct fsfs that are assigned to a particular pair of a functional sub-category and proteome. as expected, phylogenomic trees reconstructed from transformed g values for fl proteomes and artificial urancestors showed again that the urancetor was basal in the most parsimonious trees . while the basal placements of the functional urancestral sets were weakly supported , over  <dig> character-state changes between the urancestor and the set of the  <dig> most ancient taxa  supported the functional simplicity of the urancestor of life.

ribosome evolution in the urancestor
crucial ribosomal proteins act as landmarks of ribosomal evolution  <cit> . four fsfs present in universal ribosomal proteins, the nucleic acid-binding protein , ribosomal protein s <dig> domain 2-like , translation protein , and translation protein sh3-like domain  fsfs, were recruited into ribosomal function prior to a major transition in ribosomal evolution  that is claimed to be responsible for modern protein synthesis  <cit> . all of these fsfs belong exclusively to the urancestral min_set . a set of  <dig> additional fsfs that were found to associate with the ribosome immediately after this transition but before the appearance of l7/l <dig> protein complex , and ensemble that stimulates the activity of elongation factor g, are all exclusively included in the urancestral max_set . primordial protein synthesis was therefore developed in the urancestral lineage.

placing the appearance of the urancestor in the geological record
we used a molecular clock of domain structures based on the phylogenetic tree of fsfs described in figure 1b to date the appearance of the youngest domain structures in the urancestral min_set and max_set . the clock was calibrated using fsfs linked to geological ages derived from fossils, events of organismal diversification, and geochemical, biochemical and biomarker data  <cit> . plotting fold age  against geological time  revealed a significant linear correlation , which was then used to assign geological age to urancestral fsfs. the age  of the min_set fsfs ranged 0- <dig>  and the age of the max_set fsfs ranged 0- <dig> . the earliest start of organismal diversification therefore occurred sometime between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ga ago. interestingly, the first and second transitions in the evolution of the ribosome occurred before the youngest age of the min_set and max_set fsfs, respectively , suggesting efficient ribosomal protein synthesis was pre-requisite for organismal diversification.

discussion
a novel phylogenomic strategy identifies the proteome of the urancestor
a number of recent studies have focused on the complexity of the urancestor, its primordial functions, alternative rootings of the tree of life, and the rampancy of hgt  <cit> . however, results are not congruent, the rooting of the tree of life is still controversial, and the make up of the urancestor remains shrouded in mystery. it is indeed difficult to characterize an entity that existed billions of years ago using information in molecules of life that are modern. when using for example nucleic acid or protein sequences, the pervasive effects of mutation can cloud  any significant evolutionary signal. some early studies focused on genomic sequence conservation but suffered for example from the effects of genetic losses and take-overs . the analysis we here report is based on genomic content of protein domain structures at fsf level of the structural hierarchy. fsfs are much more conserved than protein sequence and are highly shared by organismal lineages. about half of fsfs  in the  <dig> fl proteomes we analyzed in this study are common to the three superkingdoms . it is clear that fsfs are more robust against genetic losses and take-overs than corresponding sequences and carry deep evolutionary signatures  <cit> . furthermore, the distribution of fsfs in proteomes meets crucial phylogenetic marker criteria since:  it rarely changes relative to speciation events ,  is minimally affected by hgt  <cit> , and  is not under active natural selection . we caution however that secondary adaptations in organism lifestyles such as parasitism could significantly affect fsf abundances in lineages undergoing reductive evolution. given all these features, fsfs are well suited for inferring the make up of the urancestor.

current top-down phylogenetic strategies used to build a tree of life generate unrooted trees and use deep taxa as outgroups a posteriori to root phylogenies. one major technical limitation of determining if given genes have an origin in the urancestor using this approach is the need of a universal tree that is accurately rooted. in some traditional studies that were based on sequence conservation, gene genealogies were largely dependent on the position of the root in trees that are used as reference  <cit> . however, guide trees built from rrnas or some ancient proteins, such as elongation factors and aminoacyl-trna synthases , produced rooting scenarios that were not congruent. inconsistencies of this kind and the possibility of unrecognized paralogy leading to incorrect gene trees have made urancestral gene assignments unreliable  <cit> . although a recent technical advance makes it possible to infer ancestral states of a given gene content using the parsimony method , it still requires organismal or genomic trees as guides and does not explore the effects of gene abundance. due to these technical limitations, the first use of fsfs to make inferences of the urancestor was solely based on the distributions of fsfs in genomes  without any phylogenetic consideration  <cit> .

in contrast, our bottom-up phylogenetic strategy uses the lundberg method  <cit>  to generate rooted phylogenomic trees without the need of outgroups . evolution's arrow is established directly by the evolutionary model, the rationale and assumptions of which have been recently reviewed  <cit> . operationally, the tree reconstruction algorithm finds the shortest unrooted tree without specifying character polarity and then roots the tree by invoking a hypothetical ancestor defined by ancestral character states and selecting the rooted topology that minimizes overall tree length . in this study, a phylogenomic tree that describes the evolution of  <dig> fl proteomes revealed the three superkingdoms as distinct groups and placed archaea at the root, with a rooting that was internal  to the superkingdom . a tree of life describing the evolution of a balanced set of proteomes corresponding to the three superkingsdoms revealed the same diversification patterns , suggesting that biases in taxon sampling do not affect the rooting of trees. the archaeal rooting of the tree of life has been reliably obtained in numerous studies with different proteomic sets  <cit>  and is congruent with phylogenetic analysis of the structure of trna  <cit> , 5s rrna  <cit>  and rnase p  <cit> , and of trna paralogs  <cit> . while its significance is not the focus and will not be discussed in this paper, a rooting in archaea  departs significantly from the 'canonical' bacterial rooting of the tree of life, which is traditionally derived from analyses of the sequence of ancient gene paralogs . it thus questions the bacterial-like origin of cellular life inferred from sequence comparisons. in turn, the phylogenomic tree that describes the evolution of  <dig>  fsf domain structures showed that the most ancient fsfs at the base of the tree  were shared by the three superkingdoms and were mostly universal . remarkably, the first loss of ancient fsfs occurred exclusively in archaeal lineages, an observation that also supports the ancestrality of archaea. again, patterns of distribution of fsfs in the trees were obtained congruently with numerous proteomic sets and releases of scop as genomic sequences and structures were acquired with time  <cit> .

trees of proteomes and trees of fsfs are generated from the same genomic structural census but represent two sides of the same story . they describe the evolution of proteomes or the evolution of the fsf structures that make up the potein complement, respectively. proteomes at the root of the tree of life are populated by fsfs that are shared by all three superkingdoms and proteomes at its crown are enriched in 'signature' fsfs that are unique to individual lineages. relatively few signature fsfs exist that are specific to superkingdoms. remarkably, proteome comparisons reveal these signatures are very unequally divided among superkingdoms  <cit>  and already suggest  that bacterial and archaeal lineages evolved from a primordial eukaryotic-like lineage by reductive loss  <cit> . phylogenomic analysis confirms this reductive evolutionary tendency, showing that the first diversified lineage to emerge by loss of fsfs gives rise to archaea, which in turn has the least number of signature fsfs and expresses the lowest levels of diversity and reuse of fsfs in nature  <cit> . the results we here report confirm once again these patterns , indicating that the urancestral proteome is populated by ancestral sets of fsfs at the base of the tree of life that appeared in the tree of fsfs before the reductive evolutionary tendency in archaea was evident  <cit> .

in order to define the proteomic make up of the urancestor, we first identified a set of  <dig> primitive  fsfs  at the root branch of the tree of fl proteomes. all fsfs of the 352_set exhibited only gains in genomic abundance, most  were common to the three superkingdoms, and interestingly, all were present in archaea . however, tracing the 352_set fsfs in the tree of domain structures revealed the set was not conservative enough to define the urancestor. a timeline describing the age of each fsf unfolded directly from the tree shows that the fsfs that are not universally shared by superkingdoms appeared for the first time in evolution in the order: be , ab fsfs , b , e , a  and ae  fsf groups . remarkably, no fsfs of the ancient be-specific group were present in the 352_set, which contains besides the universal basal_set the more derived ab, ae and a groups. similarly, the single a-specific fsf in the set  cannot be part of the urancestor . the fsf is not only absent in bacteria and eukarya but is also absent in nearly 50% of archaeal lineages examined . these results suggest many non-universal fsfs in the 352_set should not be considered urancestral and were the result of the 'modern effect'.

in order to decrease the number of false negatives, fsfs in the 352_set were assigned as initial characters in a parallel and iterative exercise of tree building and plesiomorphic character selection, with the goal of selecting for the most parsimonious tree of proteomes and the minimum number of fsfs. in each of  <dig> chains,  <dig> cycles of iteration dramatically reduced the space of urancestral fsfs . the iterative procedure resulted in a more realistic max_set of  <dig> fsfs, which:  were common to the three superkingdoms ,  excluded fsfs with decreased organismal distribution and genomic abundance levels , and  excluded fsfs that had ambiguous character-state changes in the root branch of the tree of proteomes . consequently, the iteration strategy works well to selectively filter false positives assigned to the root branch by the modern effect, decreases biases introduced by the archaeal rooting, and mitigates uncertainties in character-state reconstructions.

we note that real urancestral fsfs that have evolved with intensive losses in numerous proteomic lineages are still possible and their origins will be seen as more derived under the parsimony criterion. these false negatives in the urancestral set cannot be dissected from fsfs that diverged more recently. since the initial 352_set includes a significant number of of fsfs in the proteomes examined , this initial large coverage shields against exclusion of unknown false negatives and makes the max_set a maximum bound for the urancestral proteome. on the other hand, false positives resulting from ancient hgt events  <cit>  can still occur. for example, fsfs that appeared soon after organismal diversification but transferred extensively to different lineages may be regarded as urancestral. the gap that exists between the discovery of urancestral fsfs and fsfs that emerged at the start of organismal diversification can be identified in the tree of protein domains, since this tree unfolds the evolutionary order of appearances of each of the  <dig>  fsfs that are present in the modern proteomes we sampled . tracing the max_set fsfs in the tree of domain structures revealed that the set was not conservative enough to accurately define the urancestor and that many fsfs had low proteomic distribution  and abundance  levels. we therefore defined a more conservative min_set by intersecting the max_set derived from phylogenetic iteration and the basal_set derived from the tree of domain structure . the min_set excluded  <dig> fsf with relatively smaller f and mean of g values. this set can be considered a lower bound for the urancestral proteome.

the proteomic and functional complexity of the urancestor
we here define the urancestor as an entity that accumulated genetic information in a period that spans the emergence of life and the emergence of diversified cellular life. we also consider the urancestor as a primordial isoform of the modern ribonucleoprotein world, regardless of it being a single organism or a communal population  <cit> , especially because it contains fully functional ribosomes . we therefore compare the proteomic and functional sets of the two worlds, the ancient world of the urancestor and the modern world of extant organisms, and make inferences about biological complexity using information in molecules that are modern.

we find that the upper bound urancestral fsf max_set contains almost all essential biological processes, including crucial metabolism and transport activities linked to amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, and coenzymes, and functions associated with the information , intra-cellular processes , regulation , and general  categories . as expected, the set lacks the extra-cellular processes category, which includes molecular functions linked to definition of self and inter-cellular interactions . although some of the sub-categories  were not present in the urancestral min_set, the functions of the two urancestral sets are similar and suggest a functional complex entity  <cit> . however, the numbers of urancestral fsfs participating in individual subcategories were always smaller than those of fsfs in modern proteomes . consequently, the functional repertoire of the urancestor while exhibiting almost all essential functions should be regarded as being simpler than the repertoire of modern proteomes. we suggest fsfs of this limited repertoire acted as melting pot for new molecular functions when organismal lineages emerged, with founder biological activities being primitive and relatively non-specific  <cit> . the development of the ribosome illustrates such an origin  <cit> .

the numbers of the fsfs in major categories of the min_set, especially in information, were smaller than those of the max_set . in general, informational genes tend to form multi-component complexes stabilized by protein-protein interactions. for this reason, it has been thought that these genes are refractory to hgts  <cit> . the robustness of informational genes against transfer was previously contrasted with the rampant transfer among lineages of ancient metabolic  genes  <cit> . however, a recent study reveals hgt does not exhibit functional preferences and occurs randomly  <cit> . in turn, analysis of hgt in trees that describe the evolution of function directly from ontological data are congruent with our analysis and suggests a preferential role of hgt in shaping information-related functions  <cit> . similarly, a recent comparative statistical analysis of homoplasy levels in trees of proteomes reveals information-related domains at ff level suffered limited but comparatively significant levels of lateral exchange  <cit> . these ffs were discovered quite early in protein evolution before and after the start of the diversified world. thus, phylogenomic analysis of hgt of both biological functions and fsf structures can be used to explain why the min_set excludes preferentially these ancient hgt-susceptible fsfs. to further examine the role of ancient hgt processes on urancestral proteomic make up, we tested which of  <dig> functional sub-categories were preferentially enriched in the max_set and min_set relative to extant fl proteomes. remarkably, only two functional categories, translation  and nucleotide m/tr  were enriched in the max_set while metabolism-related transferases , small molecule binding , and nucleotide m/tr  functions were enriched in the min_set . we note that the three sub-categories enriched in the min_set include fsf belonging to primordial metabolic folds . while we do not know how many real urancestral fsfs that evolved without major hgt effects were excluded in the max_set to min_set transition, it is apparent that the proportion of horizontally transferred fsfs in the min_set is smaller than that in the max_set. consequently, the absence of translation and presence of nucleotide-related metabolic activities in the enriched functions of the min_set provides statistical support to operational genes being more robust against ancient hgts than translation-related informational genes, a result that is in contrast with previous proposals  <cit> . we hypothetize that translation was necessarily simple and flexible during its early metabolic urancestral inception  <cit> . fewer molecular interactions between components in a simpler translation system left hgt unchecked and free to shape the spread of fsfs that were recruited for the new translation functions. the numbers of translation fsfs are  <dig> and  <dig> in the min_set and max_set, respectively, which represent  <dig> % and  <dig> % of modern translational fsfs. while ancient hgt processes appear to have shaped the evolution of ancient translation-related genes during urancestral history, hgt may have not affected metabolism to such levels, especially because metabolism was already quite developed when translation materialized in evolution  <cit> . a detailed phylogenomic analysis of protein domain structure in metabolic networks reveals that the nine most ancient folds were responsible for the explosive appearance of most modern enzymatic functions  <cit> . a succession of recruitment gateways, each mediated by the discovery of a new fold showed metabolism originated in enzymes of nucleotide metabolism harboring the p-loop-containing ntp hydrolase fold , probably in pathways linked to the purine metabolic subnetwork  <cit> . crucial fsfs of these primordial metabolic folds are part of the urancestral min_set and many are part of nucleotide metabolism subnetworks . the congruent enrichment of nucleotide m/tr in both urancestral sets suggests operational genes encoding nucleotide metabolism were built in the urancestor and diverged vertically in primary lineages of the superkingdoms. interestingly, highly conserved protein-encoding sequences related to nucleotide biosynthetic pathways, including putative phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase and thioredoxin enzymes, were previously identified as being important part of the urancestral set  <cit> . this is also consistent with a study of physical clustering of genes in bacterial genomes, which also reveals the most ancient group of genes is related to metabolism  <cit> . due to statistical limitations of the hypergeometric distribution significant enrichments could not be resolved for the remaining  <dig> informational and  <dig> operational categories. a more comprehensive study will be needed to evaluate the extent of hgt in whole sets of ancient operational and informational genes.

finally, a comparison of structural and functional components of the urancestor and fl proteomes revealed the complexity of the make up of the urancestor relative to extant organisms. in terms of fsf repertoires, the numbers of distinct fsfs  of the urancestral sets were significantly smaller than those of each and every one of the fl organisms we analyzed , even if fsf reuse was considered . our estimates therefore indicate that the fsf repertoire of the urancestor  and its reuse in domains  was at least  <dig> and  <dig> times smaller than that of extant fl organisms, respectively. furthermore, the inclusion of artificial urancestral proteomes resurrected in silico in tree reconstructions generated trees of proteomes that always placed the urancestor at their base . these results support the distant relationship that exists between the urancestor with the simplest of extant proteomes, confirming the relative simplicity of the reconstructed ancestral entity. similarly, phylogenetic reconstructions derived from functional data confirm urancestral functions were quantitatively and phylogenetically simpler than functions in any extant fl proteome . consequently, the actual repertoire of the urancestor inferred from fsfs in modern proteomes, while relatively complex in the number of molecular functions it embodies, is closer to the simple progenote model and distant from the complex cenancestor model. we note however that proteins in the relatively simple fsf repertoire of the urancestor could have been non-specific, harboring a multiplicity of functions. these would have increased the effective complexity of this primordial organism. furthermore, the complex functional repertoire we reveal suggests the urancestor was a quite advanced version of the progenote, with a multiplicity of metabolic and biosynthetic functions.

emergence of translation and ribosomal machinery in the urancestor during the late archean
in a previous study, we used phylogenies of fsf and ff to study the emergence of the translation apparatus  <cit> . dissection of first appearance of fundamental innovations in molecular machinery  associated with metabolism and translation revealed translation had metabolic origins. it appeared after the discovery of a large number of metabolic functions but before enzymes necessary for the synthesis of dna. a clear timeline of molecular diversification was apparent, with domains associated with aminoacylation appearing first, immediately followed by molecular switches and regulatory factors important for trna shepherding and rna transport. additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> shows landmark domains that interact with rna  were present in the min_set, including class i  and ii catalytic  and anticodon-binding  domains of arss, gtp-binding  and elongation factor  domains of translation factors, and even ribonuclease p and ph domains  crucial for endo- and exoribonucleolytic cleavage of rna and nucleotydiltransferase activities necessary for damage repair. in contrast, none of domains present in ribonucleotide reductase enzymes responsible for producing the deoxyribonucleotide components necessary for dna-linked functions, the ferritin-like domain , n-terminal domain of cbl , and the the pfl-like glycyl radical enzyme domain , were present in the min_set. only one of these domains, c. <dig> , was present in the max_set. we note that the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides involves the production of an active site thiyl radical that requires contacts with cysteins in all protein domains of the catalytic subunit of the oligomeric enzymatic complex  <cit> , suggesting modern ribonucleotide reductase functions is indeed derived. we also note that the active site domains of class iii ribonucleotide reductases share the c. <dig>  domain and the associated radical-based chemistry with pyruvate formate-lyase enzymes, a link proposed to have mediated the rna-to-dna biological transition  <cit> . however, phylogenomic analysis at ff level  <cit>  suggests the pyruvate formate-lyase domain  emerged later than its ribonucleotide reductase counterpart . it is therefore likely that the urancestor stored genetic information as rna and not dna.

the set of fsfs of ribosomal proteins that are universal establish crucial contacts with substructures of the rrna subunits in the ribosome and appear much later than arss and regulatory factors  <cit> . a careful phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal history directly from protein and rna structure established the relative time of appearance of ribosomal proteins and rrna substructures in the ribosome  <cit> . the study reveals that proteins and rna co-evolved form the start and structures supporting protein synthesis appeared in a fundamental major transition once processivity functions involving interactions with transfer and templating rna were already functional. a set of four fsfs were recruited into ribosomal function during this initial period, including ancient ribosomal proteins with ob-fold and related sh3-like small Î²-barrel folds. remarkably, all of these fsfs belong exclusively to the urancestral min_set . a set of  <dig> additional fsfs that associated with the ribosome immediately after the major transition but before the appearance of the l7/l <dig> protein complex  <cit> , are all exclusively included in the urancestral max_set . the l7/l <dig> complex crucially stimulates the gtpase activity of elongation factor g, a ribosomal factor that catalyzes elongation and enhances ribosomal processivity  <cit> . primordial protein synthesis was therefore active in the urancestor and the processivity and efficiency of the ribosome was actively improved during urancestral evolution.

in order to place the history of the urancestor and of the ribosome in a timeline, we used a molecular clock of protein domain structure to define evolutionary timescales  <cit> . using a clock derived from the tree of fsfs of figure 1b but using the calibration points of wang et al.  <cit> , the appearance of the youngest fsfs in the urancestral min_set and max_set suggests organismal diversification was established sometime between  <dig>  and  <dig> ga ago . remarkably, the earliest date coincides with the discovery of arobic metabolism and the start of planet exigenation  <cit>  that lead to the great oxidation event  <cit> , a geological time where oxygen reached 1% of present atmospheric levels. we note that integration of molecular, physiological, paleontological, and geochemical data suggests that a diversified clade of cyanobacteria with marked heterocyst and cell differentiation appeared no later than  <dig>  ga ago  <cit>  and a number of fsfs linked to events of organismal diversification and the fossil record  <cit>   are only compatible with the existence of an urancestor before that time. this indicates the urancestral max_set is not conservative enough to accurately define the urancestor and that the min_set is clearly more appropriate. remarkably, the first and second transitions in ribosomal evolution occurred before the youngest age of min_set fsfs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ga ago, respectively, suggesting efficient ribosomal protein synthesis was pre-requisite for organismal diversification and emerged prior to the aerobic metabolism and the start of planet oxygenation .

the diversification of cellular membranes marks the end of the urancestor
the chirality and chemistry of glycerol membrane lipids is different in archaea  than in bacteria and eukarya , a feature that is claimed to be important for the rise of a diversified organismal world  <cit> . in fact, a widely popular model for organismal diversification is the existence of heterochiral glycerolipids in the primordial membranes of the urancestor, which were synthetized as racemates but then segregated in sn <dig>  and sn <dig>  lineages during organismal diversification  <cit> . these different chiral forms are synthetized in two different metabolic pathways that start with the reduction of a keto group from dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and use two different stereochemistry-specific glycerol phosphate backbones. in bacteria and eukarya, the synthesis of sn <dig>  fatty acid ester lipids starts with the convertion of dhap to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate  by the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . this enzymatic reaction is the first step of pathways needed to produce the ester-fatty acid double layer typical of eukaryotes and mesophylic and psychrophilic bacteria.  

in contrast, the first step in the synthesis of sn <dig>  isoprenoid ether lipids in archaea starts by the reduction of dhap to sn-glycerol 1-phosphate , the enantiomer of g3p, by the zn2+-dependent glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase  metalloenzyme . the biosynthesis of polar lipids in archaea requires the activity of two additional enzymes, the -3-o-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase  and the - <dig> -di-o-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase  that together alkylate the hydroxy groups of g1p to give sn-3-o-glycerol 1-phosphate  and  <dig> -bis-o-glycerol  and later produce unsaturated archaetidic acid with geranylgeranyl chains and cdp-unsaturated archaeol through downstream activity of the cdp-archaeol synthase  enzyme.  

to date there are no known exceptions to a g1p backbone chemistry in archaea and a g3p backbone chemistry in the other two superkingdoms. however, some extremophilic bacteria also contain membrane ether lipids , including di-glycerol ether lipids, tetraether non-isoprenoid lipids, and mixed ester-ether lipids, but they are all of the sn <dig>  kind .

since dgggps is not stereospecific, the chirality of the isoprenoid ether lipids in archaea appears entirely determined by gggps  <cit> . remarkably, the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase c-terminal domain-like  fsf of the bacterial and eukaryal g3pdh  and the fmn-linked oxydoreductase domain  fsf of the gggps  necessary for downstream membrane lipid biosynthesis in archaea were present in the urancestral min_set and appeared in the timeline of domain architectures quite early in evolution. a min_set g3dph suggests primordial sn <dig>  fatty acid ester lipids of some kind were already present in the urancestor. in turn, a min_set gggps enzyme harboring the only tim Î²/Î±-barrel fold-containing enzyme with a prenyltransferase function  <cit>  suggests chirality-enabling enzymatic activities downstream of g1dph were already present in the urancestor.

we note that cdp-archaeol synthase activity, which is downstream of g1pdg, does not require specificity for ester or ether bonds nor of glycerol phosphate enantiomers  <cit>  and that full conversion of bacterial-like lipids to archaeal-like lipids requires the crucial discovery or recruitment of g1pdh metalloenzyme activities necessary for the production fo the g1p backbone  <cit> . the urancestral gggps catalyses the first cdp-archaeol biosynthesis pathway-specific step of isoprenoid ether lipids in archaea but displays a strong preference for the g1p substrate  <cit> . g1pdh does not yet have a crystallographic structural entry. however, molecular modeling suggests the enzyme was derived from glycerol dehydrogenase   <cit> , which is present in the three superkingdoms and has the dehydroquinate synthase-like domain  fsf. a total of  <dig> uniprot entries with ec  <dig> . <dig>  functions were analyzed with hmms of structural recognition. all sequence entries were indeed assigned the e. <dig>  fsf. two entries had also the had-like domain . while this analysis confirms the original structural assingment  <cit> , we find the g1pdh fsf was not part of any of the urancestral fsf sets. this strongly suggests isoprenoid ether lipids derived from g1p were not present in the urancestor. instead, and as suggested by glansdorff et al.  <cit> , sn <dig>  isoprenoid ether lipids were probably synthetized by the activity of the urancestral gggps, which at that time could have exhibited a preference for g3p. recruitment of a g1pdh in emerging archaeal lineages displaced the possible use of g3p by gggps and enabled the synthesis of sn <dig>  isoprenoid ether lipids using the g1p backbone. it is significant that the molecular clock of fsfs established that the gggps c. <dig>  fsf appeared  <dig>  ga ago and that the g1pdh e. <dig>  fsf appeared  <dig>  ga ago at a time that coincides with the great oxidation event . in this regard, cyclic and acyclic phytanes and biphytanes, which are present in sediments and petroleum in  <dig> -ga-old metasedimentary rocks in several parts of the world  <cit>  and are biomarkers of methanotrophic pelagic microbes, are thought to derive from archaeol and caldarchaeol molecules of archaea  <cit> . the existense of gggps prior to this date supports the existence of a primordial cdp-archaeol biosynthetic pathway and of ether and ester membrane lipids in the urancestor, prior to the loss of the first fsf in a superkingdom  that marks the start of the tripartite world and the earliest date of organismal diversification . the synthesis of an enantiomeric alternative of g3p in primordial archaeal lineages,  <dig> million years later and during late planet oxygenation, provided the proper molecular chirality and backbone necessary for cell membrane diversification. our findings are important and support the proposal that the urancestor had sn <dig>  ester and ether fatty acid lipids and that discovery and recruitment of new enzymatic activities resulted in the synthesis of sn <dig>  isoprenoid ether lipids and the emergence of thermophilic archaeal lineages  <cit> . under this scenario, the ester and ether lipids in the urancestor provided already adaptations to adverse conditions , a trend that was later exploited by the emerging archaeal lineages in a primordial quest towards extremophily.

CONCLUSIONS
the history of proteomes and the protein world was reconstructed from a census of protein domain structure at fsf level of structural complexity in hundreds of fl proteomes. applying an iterative approach of character state reconstruction, we identified the most parsimonious repertoire of domain structures that was present in the urancestor. upper and lower bounds of the repertoire defined conservative limits for the diversity of domains and associated functions and showed the uracestor had a functionally complex but relatively simple repertoire, with numbers of fsfs probably orders of magnitude below that of extant organisms. since the lower bound is more compatible with a molecular clock of fsfs and the fossil record, we can make reasonable inferences about the molecular make up of this primordial organism. the urancestor had an advanced metabolic network, especially rich in nucleotide metabolism enzymes, had primordial pathways for the biosynthesis of membrane glycerol ether and ester lipids, crucial elements of translation, including arss, regulatory factors, and a primordial ribosome with protein synthesis capabilities. it lacked however transcription and in advanced evolutionary stages stored genetic information in rna  molecules. as this ancient organism expanded its protein biosynthetic functions ~ <dig> ga ago, it added crucial ribosomal proteins that enhanced the reliability and processivity of the ribosome and crucial enzymes that diversified its membrane lipid make up. we here propose the enhancement of the primordial ribosomal machinery and the make up of the cellular containment, which coincided with the rise of planetary oxygen, enabled the rise of lineages and a truly diversified world of organisms.
