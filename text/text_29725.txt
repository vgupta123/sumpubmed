BACKGROUND
rhizobia comprise a group of α- and β-proteobacteria known for their ability to establish symbioses with several leguminous species. the rhizobium-legume interaction, characterized by an exchange of signal molecules from both partners, culminates in the formation of specific structures, called nodules, where biological nitrogen fixation takes place . this molecular dialogue begins with the exudation of flavonoids by the host legume roots that are recognized by a lysr-type transcriptional regulator in the bacterium, the nodd protein, which triggers the expression of the so-called nodulation  genes by binding to specific sequences, nod boxes , located upstream of these genes. their cognate enzymes are implied in the production of lipochitooligosaccharides, also known as nod factors , which in turns induce the formation of root nodule primordia and play an essential role in the infection process. a part from flavonoids, other rhizobial nod gene inducers have been identified, such as betaines  <cit> , but they are required at higher concentrations  <cit> .

rhizobium tropici ciat  <dig>  is a broad host-range rhizobial strain isolated from tropical acid soils of south america that effectively nodulates several legumes, including phaseolus vulgaris, macroptilium atropurpureum, and leucaena leucocephala  <cit> . main characteristics of this strain includes its high tolerance to several environmental stresses such as high temperature, acidity or salinity and its capacity to producing a large variety of nf in the presence of inducer flavonoids, such as apigenin  <cit> . it is remarkable that under acidity or salt stress conditions the synthesis of nf in ciat  <dig> is also induced, resulting in increased diversity and concentration of these molecules in comparison to non-stressing conditions  <cit> . interestingly, guasch-vidal et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that, even in the absence of flavonoids, ciat  <dig> is able of synthesizing nf in the presence of high concentrations of salt, and the biological activity of these nf was confirmed. moreover, the activation under salt stress is independent of nodd <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that initial steps of rhizobium-legume symbioses are very sensitive to salt stress. however, the ability to form root nodules on their host legume species under saline conditions has been described for many rhizobia  <cit> . in general, rhizobial strains use distinct mechanisms for osmotic adaptation under salt stressing conditions during the free-lifestyle, such as the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes and specific ions, modification in cell surface polysaccharides or the synthesis of certain abc membrane transporters  <cit> . however, the synthesis of salt-induced nf has been only reported in ciat  <dig> 

genome sequencing of ciat  <dig> revealed five different nodd genes and three different noda genes in the symbiotic plasmid  <cit> . noda catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acyl group from an acyl carrier protein to a terminal n-glucosamine residue previously deacetyled by nodb, on the chitin oligomer  <cit> . the noda <dig> gene is located adjacent to nodd <dig>  whose encoded protein seems to be the major regulator of nf synthesis upon induction with flavonoid  <cit>  and together with nodbc compose an operon responsible for the synthesis of the nf core. the noda <dig> gene is part of a gene cluster including hsnt and nodfe, implied in unsaturated fatty acid incorporation into nf molecules and is located close to the nodd <dig> gene. curiously, a previous study  <cit>  showed that, apparently, the activation of the expression of the nodc gene under salt stress is lower in a nodd <dig> mutant than in both a nodd <dig> mutant and the wild-type strain. finally, noda <dig> is located downstream the nodd <dig> gene but no other symbiotic-related genes have been identified in its vicinities  <cit> .

the main objective of this study was to identify genes of ciat  <dig> that are differentially expressed in the presence of the nod-gene inducer molecules apigenin and salt by rna-seq analysis. in addition, the promoter regions of the symbiotic genes that were up-regulated in both conditions were studied to determine possible conserved promoter consensus motifs. our results showed similar patterns of expression for the differentially expressed genes of the symbiotic plasmid replicon in the presence of both apigenin and salt, indicating that the nf synthesis was carried out following the same pathway, independently of the inducer molecule. the biological significance of the ciat  <dig> transcriptomic response under salt condition was discussed.

RESULTS
identification of the differentially expressed genes
to identify differentially expressed genes in the presence of nod gene inducers six rna-seq libraries were generated from ciat  <dig> grown in the presence of apigenin , salt  or under control conditions. two independent biological experiments were carried out for each condition, being the general features of each run shown in additional file  <dig>  libraries were sequenced and a range of  <dig> to  <dig> million reads were obtained in each condition, indicating that similar amounts of data were generated independently of the growth condition. three different rna-seq metrics for quality control, such as gc content, duplicate distribution, and the distribution of respective genetic coordinates, were performed . besides, before all subsequent analysis, a normalization of the quantitative data was performed to avoid statistical deviations due to differences in library and genetic sizes  <cit>  . data set were validated by qrt-pcr . in all cases, positive correlation degrees were obtained in fold-change values of the qrt-pcr and the rna-seq data .table  <dig> rna-seq data validation using qrt-pcr. fold-change values were calculated using the ∆∆ct method and normalized to the reference gene rna 16s for  <dig> differentially expressed genes. hp: gene that codes for a hypothetical protein

r. tropici ciat  <dig> genome contains  <dig> genes distributed among one chromosome  and three different plasmids: prtrciat899a/pa , prtrciat899b/pb/symbiotic plasmid , and prtrciat899c/pc   <cit> . differentially expressed genes in each condition were obtained using the statistical software r. results revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes when the bacterium was grown in the presence of apigenin  and  <dig> genes when the bacterium was grown under salt stress condition . in the first case,  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and located in the symbiotic plasmid, while the other  <dig> were down-regulated and distributed in the other replicons: chromosome  and plasmids a  and c  . with respect to the cultures supplemented with salt, the majority of genes were down-regulated ; only  <dig> genes were over-expressed representing  <dig>  % of the differentially expressed genes . replicon distribution revealed that most of these genes  were located in the chromosome, some in plasmid b  and the rest in plasmid c  .fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed genes. percentage and location of differentially expressed genes  in r. tropici ciat  <dig> induced with apigenin  or salt . ch: chromosome, pa: prtrciat899a, pb: prtrciat899b, pc: prtrciat899c. the number of differentially expressed genes is indicated under each replicon

functions associated to responses to nod gene-inducing molecules
ciat  <dig> is able to synthesize nf not only upon induction with flavonoid but also under salt stress  <cit> . to evaluate which functions are intrinsic to each inducing condition, a functional enrichment was carried out to assign the statistically over-represented biological processes  using data available at the uniprot database . results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  as expected, when induced with apigenin, some of the differentially expressed genes were involved in nodulation and oligosaccharide transport . the same biological processes were also activated under salt stress. however, the presence of salt also induced many other biological processes such as nitrogen fixation, chemotaxis, carbohydrate metabolism, transcription, translation, conjugation and atp biosynthesis . rna-seq and proteomics studies performed on other rhizobial strains under saline and heat shock conditions revealed that many of these processes are also being altered  <cit> .fig.  <dig> number of regulated genes from each over-represented biological process . biological processes and number of genes affected in bacterial cultures supplemented with apigenin  a or salt  . over-represented functional categories were those with a p value in hypergeometrical test inferior to  <dig> 



apigenin activates the transcription of nod gene operons and the synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid
the ciat  <dig> genome harbors five different nod genes and three different noda genes in the symbiotic plasmid  <cit> . are the noda1bc and the noda2fe operons and the noda <dig> gene of ciat  <dig> activated by apigenin? transcriptomic analysis revealed that four sets of genes were significantly up-regulated in the symbiotic plasmid under this condition. two of them corresponded to the noda <dig> and noda <dig> operons, the third, located adjacent to the nodd <dig> gene, was involved in the synthesis of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid   <cit> , and the last set of genes coded for proteins with unknown functions . therefore, at least two main biological processes were activated in ciat  <dig> when induced with apigenin: the synthesis of nf  and the production of iaa . of special interest is the elucidation of the symbiotic role of the set of genes with unknown function activated with apigenin . in summary, these results indicate that when induced with apigenin, ciat  <dig> is able to synthesize nf that will induce root nodule primordia formation, as well as phytohormones that will favor root development. this is consistent with a recent study in which an increase in the production of iaa is reported when ciat  <dig> is grown in cultures supplemented with both apigenin and salt  <cit> . a similar regulation cascade involving nodd <dig> and flavonoids has been reported in sinorhizobium fredii ngr <dig> for the synthesis of iaa  <cit> .fig.  <dig> circular representation of the complete rna-seq-based transcriptomic data set of apigenin and salt cultures versus standard cultures for all replicons of r. tropici ciat  <dig>  fold-change values of consecutive genes are represented by linked peaks. each peak corresponds to one gene, being ordered according to their relative position in the replicon. yellow peaks: differentially expressed genes in the presence of apigenin. blue peaks: differentially expressed genes under salt stress. the arrows indicate names and related biological processes of some differentially expressed genes. nb: nod box. a chromosome , b prtrciat899a , c prtrciat899b , d prtrciat899c 



common responses: synthesis of nodulation molecules and identification of nod boxes
as previously mentioned in the introduction, the capacity to nodulate under salt stress conditions has been described for many rhizobial strains  <cit> . however, the salt-regulated production of nf has been only reported for r. tropici ciat  <dig>  are the ciat  <dig> genetic pathways to synthesize nf under salt stress similar to those described for apigenin? the rna-seq analysis shown in this work indicated that although the pattern of symbiotic gene activation in the presence of salt was similar to that obtained with apigenin , slightly higher expressions of nod genes, with an emphasis on the noda <dig> operon, was observed when the bacterium was induced with salt . moreover, under salt stress nodm and a gene that codes for a flavine mononucleotide reductase  were significantly up-regulated. although the up-regulation of nodm was not detected in the rna-seq of ciat  <dig> grown in the presence of apigenin, it was detected in the qrt-pcr analysis  .table  <dig> fold-change expression values of the r. tropici ciat  <dig> nod genes on the rna-seq analysis. fold-change values followed by an asterisk  are significantly over-expressed

























all these results indicate that the transcription of the ciat  <dig> nod genes seems to respond similarly to the presence of either apigenin or salt . the question that remains unclear is whether the responses observed follow the common nodd activation pathway. to answer this question, an in silico analysis to detect promoter motifs was conducted using consensus sequences of nod boxes  present in other related rhizobial strains. thus, ten potential nb were identified, all sharing the at-n11-at-n7-at-n2-a-n4-at-n2-att-n-t sequence consensus . four of these nb were situated upstream of the four different sets of genes up-regulated under both inducing conditions, namely, the operons noda1bcsuijhpq1q <dig> , noda2hsntnodfe , y4wef operon  and the nodm gene  . interestingly, two of the genes previously identified as up-regulated with apigenin  were also induced with salt. the expression of one of these genes  was validated by qrt-pcr in the presence of both apigenin  and salt  . this gene expression, combined with the fact that both genes were located downstream nb <dig>  indicate that these hypothetical proteins could be playing a role in the symbiotic process . finally, nb <dig> was located upstream a gene  up-regulated with salt, but not with apigenin .fig.  <dig> alignment of nb sequences from r. tropici ciat  <dig>  software fuzznuc of the emboss package was used to identify nod box-like sequences. hits were selected based on their conservation to previously identified nb sequences. searching of these consensus sequences was carried out on the whole genome of r. tropici ciat  <dig>  dna sequences were aligned using the clustalw program and manipulated with boxshade at embnet. dark and gray boxes indicate identical and similar nucleotides, respectively. promoter consensus motifs are marked with an asterisk on the consensus line


athe transcriptional orientation of this gene is opposite to the nb <dig> sequence orientation



altogether, these results suggest that when ciat  <dig> was induced either by apigenin or salt, genes related to the synthesis of nf and iaa were activated through the recognition of specific nod boxes . in s. fredii ngr <dig>  nineteen nod boxes have been identified and eighteen of them were inducible with flavonoids via nodd <dig>  in addition, s. fredii ngr <dig> carries two copies of the nodd gene and four of these nod boxes are controlled by nodd <dig>  <cit> .

salt stress response: a pathway towards symbiosis?
chromosomal rna-seq analysis showed, under salt stress, an up-regulation of genes whose products are implied in the formation of ribosomes  and in the utilization of the disaccharide trehalose , an osmotic stabilizer  <cit> . instead, down-regulation was detected in genes that encode proteins involved in chemotaxis   <cit> , formation of flp-type pili   <cit> , or abc-type transport . in addition, a set of genes located in prtrciat899c and involved in the export of capsular polysaccharide across the inner membrane  was also down-regulated   <cit> .

therefore, the global response of ciat  <dig> to salt stress indicates that the strain drastically reduces the uptake of molecules and the energy consumption, reducing the atp-dependent transport of the abc-type permeases. however, under saline shock conditions r. etli ce <dig> over-expresses genes that code for many abc transporters and increases the transcription levels of genes related to the biosynthesis of trehalose  <cit> . nevertheless, in ciat  <dig> an up-regulation of genes involved in the degradation of trehalose was detected. the explanation could be that this osmolyte tends to accumulate during symbiosis, but it is toxic to plants. to solve this problem, bacteria would produce trehalose-degrading enzymes  <cit> . these observations in ciat  <dig>  combined with the production of nf and iaa under salt stress, make us formulate the next question: could the promotion of the symbiosis represent a strategy of ciat  <dig> to ensure nodulation under this abiotic stress condition? to shed light on this question we have analyzed the changes in biological processes under saline conditions. first, we observed an enhancement in ribosomal synthesis, which could be related to a translation increase due to an increase in the transcription of nodulation genes . second, general protein secretion systems and surface polysaccharides seem to play an important role in bacterial fitness under stressing environmental conditions, such as high salinity or temperature  <cit> . however, in ciat  <dig> we observed inhibition under salt stress. remarkably, both cellular components can also be considered microbe-associated molecular patterns , which trigger the plant immune system  <cit> . other rhizobial strains in the presence of inducer flavonoids modify their surface molecules to avoid plant immune responses, thereby promoting nodulation  <cit> . finally, when colonizing legume roots many rhizobia form micro-colonies or biofilms. in some of these rhizobia common nod genes are required for the development of these structures, since the biofilm matrix is composed in part by nf  <cit> . thus, in ciat  <dig>  the synthesis of nf and the down-regulation of chemotaxis genes detected under saline conditions could be related to the formation of a symbiotic biofilm. in summary , these results suggest that in the presence of salt ciat  <dig> could strategically increase the transcription of nodulation genes and the synthesis of nf to increase the chances to establish symbiosis even under abiotic stressing conditions.fig.  <dig> model of the rhizobium tropici ciat  <dig> transcriptomic response under salt stress. rna-seq studies indicate that in the presence of high concentration of salt ciat  <dig> increase the transcription of nodulation genes and the synthesis of nf. transcriptional activation  or inhibition  of other biological processes associated with the presence of salt supports the hypothesis that salt-dependent production of nf could be a special r. tropici ciat  <dig> strategy to ensure nodulation under salt stress conditions. hp: gene that codes for a hypothetical protein



CONCLUSIONS
our work shows that in the presence of the nodulation inducing molecules apigenin  and salt , r. tropici ciat  <dig> increases the transcription of the same set of genes , whose encoded proteins are involved in the synthesis of symbiotic molecules. besides, the salt-dependent production of these symbiotic molecules could be a ciat  <dig> strategy to ensure nodulation under salt stress.
