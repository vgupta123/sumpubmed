BACKGROUND
the word coffee comes from the name of the place in ethiopia called “kaffa”. “kaffa” means the plants of god  <cit> . coffee classified under the family of rubiaceae in the genus coffea. there are many species of coffee, but the two most widely cultivated are c. arabica l. and c. canephora . southwestern and southeastern ethiopia considered as the origin of c. arabica l.   <cit> . of the total world production of coffee, c. arabica l. takes the lion’s share, which is 66% and c. canephora only of 34%. although coffee produced in few countries, it is the most traded agricultural products around the globe after oil. according to a  <dig> report by the international coffee organization, the top six coffee producing countries in our globe are brazil, vietnam, colombia, indonesia, ethiopia, and india. in ethiopia, it is mostly exported cash crop that accounts for 69% of all agriculturally export commodities and it was estimated that at least  <dig> million of ethiopian population depend directly or indirectly on coffee production  <cit> . similarly, there are around  <dig>  coffee growers in india; 98% of them are small-scale growers.

one of the challenges in coffee production industry is the impact of the coffee pathogen, especially pathogenic fungi, which results in reduced production and low quality of coffee seeds  <cit> . the yield loss due to the fungal pathogens, especially colletotrichum species, and fusarium species have been repeatedly reported from coffee growing areas . coffee berry disease caused by colletotrichum khawae is causing a major yield loss in coffee growing areas of ethiopia  <cit> . c. khawae and c. gloeosporioides are the most abundantly found pathogens in diseased coffee seeds  <cit> . c. gloeosporioides also listed as one of important coffee pathogens by the coffee board of india. apart from the coffee plant, c. gloeosporioides penz possesses a broad host range  and ranked as the most devastating plant pathogen in the genus colletotrichum  <cit> . fusarium species also cause serious impact on the coffee production industry. coffee wilt disease caused by gibberella xylarioides  causes approximately 3360 t of coffee yield losses each year in ethiopia  <cit> . this production loss causes a great economic loss around the world, for example, ethiopia loses an estimated  <dig>  million american dollars every year.

chemical pesticides used currently to control coffee pathogens needed to spray 7– <dig> times annually which is laborious and expensive. furthermore, the extensive use of chemical pesticides also contributes to emerging pesticide resistant pathogens. the uses of chemical pesticides and fertilizers have also a negative impact on the indigenous microbial community by disturbing the natural distribution of microbial niche. the coffee cultivated with no or less application of chemical pesticides have more consumer acceptance. in addition, the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable way of disease controlling system gained major attention in recent years. in this view, rhizosphere is the ideal place to search potential rhizobacteria that are capable of promoting plant growth and suppressing the phytopathogens.

extensive studies of the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria  for disease control and plant growth promotion in the coffee plant have not been reported. it is necessary and useful to evaluate and document indigenous beneficial microbe isolated from coffee and test them against coffee pathogens. in the current study, several bacteria from the rhizosphere of c. arabica l. were isolated and the potent bacterium antagonistic to c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum was chosen, which also showed multiple plant growth promoting activity. the potent isolate showed maximum similarity with bacillus amyloliquefaciens by 16 s rrna gene sequencing and by blasting this sequence against reference sequences found in the international nucleotide database using the program called blastn.

further confirmation of the compound was carried out by qualitative tests using the general reagent for alkaloids  and it was found to be positive and specifically for the presence of indole derivates using glyoxylic-sulphuric acid test. accordingly, the solution containing the c <dig> showed a positive test for the presence of alkaloid and showed a positive test for the presence of indole derivative, forming a purple to violet ring at the junction of two distinct phases when glyoxylic acid and the test solution mixed in the presence of conc. h2so <dig>  the secondary metabolite harmine could be the principal reason for inhibition of growth of c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum.

discussion
in the present study, we have isolated potent bacillus species  that is able to inhibit c. gloeosporioides  and f. oxysporum . in a review of similar studies, bacillus sp. strain rmb <dig>  which has broad range antifungal activity showed 71% and 78% mycelial growth inhibition of f. oxysporum and c. gloeosporioides respectively  <cit> . bt <dig> produces known extracellular lytic enzymes , which are significantly correlated with fungi mycelial growth inhibition. in a similar study conducted elsewhere, significant mycelial growth inhibition of g. xylarioides  by the chitinase producing bacillus species isolate named as ju <dig> was also reported  <cit> . apart from chitinase and β- <dig> -glucanase, bt <dig> produced protease and lipase that might be involved in the inhibition of the mycelial growth of c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum. earlier reports indicated that protease  <cit>  and lipase production  <cit>  by bacteria are associated with inhibition of mycelial growth of different fungi.

since the statistical correlation of growth inhibition of pathogenic fungi and lytic enzyme produced were positive but mostly less than  <dig>  r, more than one mechanism of inhibition of pathogenesis was suspected. the production of siderophore by bt <dig> might also be involved in the inhibition of fungi. bacteria produce siderophores during iron starvation. the previous report indicates that siderophores produced by bacillus subtilis have got potential to inhibit the growth of f. oxysporum  <cit> . bacillus amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  which has maximum similarity with bt <dig>  harbors genes responsible for the synthesis of siderophores  <cit> .

apart from production of lytic enzymes and siderophores, from the culture filtrate of bt <dig>  we also isolated and identified antifungal compound, which is confirmed as harmine  <cit> . harmine is β-carboline alkaloid that was first isolated from peganum harmala l  <cit> . harmine is rarely reported from bacteria and it is mostly extracted from higher plants  <cit> . harmine production in bacteria was limited to a few species including enterococcus faecium, myxobacter and pseudomonas species . however, the recent report by saad and zakaria demonstrated that bacillus flexus isolated from fresh water produced harmine as a mechanism of inhibition of toxic cyanobacteria and this was considered as the first report from bacillus species  <cit> . in our present study, we identified harmine from the cultural extract of bacillus species  isolated from root rhizosphere of c. arabica l., which is the first report of its type. this is the first report of inhibition of pathogens of c. arabica l., c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum by plant growth promoting rhizobacterium by an alkaloid harmine. the inhibitory activity of β-carboline alkaloids against different fungi that include c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum was recently described although the β-carboline alkaloids were extracted from the plant  <cit> .

to sum up, the highest inhibition of c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum mycelial growth by the bacillus species  is due to the synergistic effect of multiple mechanisms, which could be explained as the production of lytic enzymes and harmine, which is produced as an extracellular secondary metabolite.

apart from biocontrol activity, bacillus species  also exhibited plant growth promoting characteristics  that directly involved in plant growth promotion and indirectly in the pathogen suppression. the production of iaa by rhizobacteria is so important in supporting plant growth and development by interfering with the endogenous iaa produced by the plant and serve in defense responses . studies showed that bacillus amyloliquefaciens is known to produce a substantial amount of iaa  <cit> . another important trait displayed by bacillus species  is the ability to produce an enzyme acc deaminase. the production of acc deaminase by the bt <dig> is also vital in plant-microbe interaction; that enables the host plant to withstand stress due to drought and flooding by decreasing the endogenous ethylene levels. studies showed that bacillus amyloliquefaciens has the versatile potential for both plant growth and biocontrol activity of different phytopathogenic fungi, which is similarly strengthened by our present study .

the high disease incidence caused by c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum were significantly reduced in the presence of bt <dig> due to the potential biocontrol activity of this bacterium. in bt <dig> treated c. arabica l seeds, germination occurred much better than that of untreated, which indicates that the isolate facilitated germination of the c. arabica l. seeds by the extracellular production of pgpr traits that supported the germination.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have isolated a bacillus species , which shows the versatility of direct and indirect plant growth promoting traits. bt <dig> showed maximum similarity with bacillus amyloliquefaciens in ncbi blastn result and shows maximum similarity with the same bacterium by ez taxon database. this bacterium could effectively inhibit pathogens of c. arabica l. the mechanisms of inhibition of c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum were found to be the production of lytic enzymes, siderophores as well as antifungal compounds. the major antifungal compound was identified as harmine , which is not previously reported as a mechanism of action of pgpr. to this end, the bt <dig> isolate can be a potential candidate to be used as a biocontrol of c. gloeosporioides and f. oxysporum and also as biofertilizer.
