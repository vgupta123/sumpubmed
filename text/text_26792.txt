BACKGROUND
nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase  is with about  <dig> kda  <cit>  the largest of the five complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation  and a major contributor to the proton motive force that drives the atp production by atp-synthase  <cit> . complex i has an l-shape with a hydrophilic matrix arm that protrudes into the cytoplasm in bacteria or the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotes and a hydrophobic membrane arm. the canonical “core” of complex i consists of  <dig> subunits that originate from three pre-existing evolutionary modules  <cit> . the n-module at the distal end of the matrix arm contains flavin-mononucleotide  that accepts electrons from a donor, usually nadh. the electrons are transported through a chain of iron-sulfur  clusters along the matrix arm towards the joint of the two arms at the membrane. this membrane-proximal part of the matrix arm represents the q-module in which the electrons are transferred to ubiquinone . the energy freed by the electron-transfer is transmitted along the p-module  that uses the energy to pump protons across the membrane  <cit> .

in diverse taxa, the canonical core of complex i has been extended by further subunits. for instance, complex i in thermus thermophilus contains an additional subunit located at the interface of the n- and q-modules  <cit>  and a recent analysis of complex i in the α-proteobacterium paracoccus denitrificans identified three additional subunits  <cit> . eukaryotes obtained complex i with the endosymbiotic uptake of an α-proteobacterium that gave rise to the mitochondria. following the endosymbiosis, the mitochondrial genome was reduced and the genes encoding matrix arm subunits of complex i were transferred to the nucleus. additionally, complex i was extended to up to  <dig> subunits by so-called “accessory” or “supernumerary” subunits  <cit> . this set of permanent subunits is further extended by a number of assembly factors absent from the mature complex  <cit> .

up to now, the structures of the complete complex in the eubacterium thermus thermophilus <cit>  and the eukaryote yarrowia lipolytica <cit>  have been published. however, the latter structure is of a too low resolution to allow identification of the positions of the supernumerary subunits. approximate subunit positions within the eukaryotic complex are hinted at by various types of experiments, mostly from sub-complexes observed by fractionation or as assembly intermediates . for instance, the application of chaotropic detergents to the bovine complex produces the three sub-complexes iα, iλ, and iγ. because these sub-complexes are large, they provide only rough information about subunit positions. for instance, iα represents an extended iλ sub-complex and the additional subunits could in principle be located anywhere on the surface of the iλ sub-complex. only limited data are available from yeast-two-hybrid  <cit> , co-immunoprecipitation  <cit> , or cross-linking  <cit>  experiments. the identification of the positions of the assembly factors is hampered by the temporariness of the assembly intermediates and our incomplete understanding of the assembly process.

the increasing number of genome sequences allows making predictions of physical interactions by evolutionary correlation methods, including the co-occurrence of genes or phylogenetic profiling  <cit> , the mirror-tree approach  <cit> , and residue correlation  <cit> , which have successfully identified new complex i subunits and assembly factors  <cit>   and predicted relations between the five oxphos complexes  <cit> . of these methods, residue correlation is based on the most direct evidence of physical interaction, namely the compensatory mutations at sites of interacting residues to maintain the structure of a protein or complex. by contrast, the mirror-tree method detects co-evolution more indirectly by correlating sequence similarity matrices between orthologous groups  <cit> . the similarities between protein sequences depend both on species divergence times and on rates of evolution. by removing the similarity due to the species divergence times  <cit> , one obtains similarities that are more related to evolutionary rates. a high correlation in evolutionary rates between protein families can be evidence of a direct physical relation between proteins. for instance, if there is selection to maintain the interaction of two proteins then disrupting mutations have to be compensated for at the rate that they occur. therefore, to maintain the interaction, an increased rate of change in one protein needs to be compensated for at a similar rate in the other protein. note that the pairwise correlations in evolutionary rates between proteins can also be due to indirect interactions  <cit> .

here we ask whether we can use evolutionary rate correlations to predict the three-dimensional  conformation of complex i. to this aim, we analyzed the evolutionary rate correlation between  <dig> subunits and  <dig> assembly factors of human complex i using the mirror-tree method  <cit>  and find that subunits that are known to be physically close in complex i tend to show a higher degree of correlation in evolutionary rates than those that are physically distant. in the conserved core of the matrix arm, this correlation is strong enough to construct a 3d model with striking similarity to the bacterial reference structure. in a second evolutionary model that includes the  <dig> canonical core subunits, the membrane and matrix arms appear as clearly separated groups. finally, we calculated a third evolutionary model including  <dig> subunits and seven assembly factors. this last model retains some features of the physical structure, including the separation of the matrix and membrane arms and a proximodistal axis in the matrix arm. we discuss the positions of the seven assembly factors in this model and make specific predictions about the association of some assembly factors with each other and with the permanent subunits.

RESULTS
correlation of physical and co-evolutionary distances in the conserved core
because our study aims at complex i of human we selected  <dig> subunits and seven assembly factors of the human complex that have a sufficient number of orthologs for the application of the mirror-tree method . shortly, we collected homologs of the  <dig> proteins by querying the nr database. all orthologous sequence sets were aligned and highly variable alignment columns were filtered out using bmge  <cit> . note that nadh <dig>  4l and  <dig> could not unambiguously be located in our reference – the structure of the complete complex i of t. thermophilus <cit>  . however, these subunits are known to be direct neighbors and we decided to treat them as a single unit, termed nadh34l <dig>  we calculated maximum-likelihood trees from the alignments  <cit>  and obtained a distance matrix for each protein family from which we removed the common signal of the phylogeny  <cit> . the phylogeny-corrected matrices were correlated and the resulting correlation matrix was transformed into the distance matrix . for the purpose of this article we call these distances “co-evolutionary” but note that the signal measured by the mirror-tree method is also determined by expression and general functional relatedness  <cit> .

first we examined how well the co-evolutionary distances correspond with the distances between the  <dig> subunits of the conserved core of complex i . we compared the co-evolutionary distances to the distances of the centers of mass of the protein . we will refer to these latter distances as “physical distances” and to the arrangement of the subunit centers in three dimensions as the “quaternary topology” of complex i. a direct comparison of the two distance measures reveals that more than 40% of the variation in the co-evolutionary distances can be explained by the physical distances of the subunit . within the matrix arm, physical distance explains more than 60% of the variation in co-evolutionary distances . although there is no significant correlation among the membrane arm subunits , the between-arm co-evolutionary distances clearly are larger than the within-arm co-evolutionary distances, reflecting the physical separation of the two arms.

the high correlation of co-evolutionary and physical distance suggests that it may be possible to obtain an accurate 3d model of the protein complex from the pairwise co-evolutionary distances. we used classical multidimensional scaling  to integrate the co-evolutionary distances between the seven matrix arm core subunits into an evolutionary 3d configuration. to ensure that the 3d configuration reliably reflects the co-evolutionary distances, we calculated the p3-value of the configuration, a cmds-specific goodness-of-fit measure that is analogous to the fraction of variation explained by the first three eigenvalues in a principal component analysis  <cit>  . the p3-value of the evolutionary configuration is  <dig>  and thus close to that of a perfect fit  and well above the cutoff  <dig>  suggested as desirable  <cit> . next, we compared the evolutionary 3d model with the bacterial structure . the correlation of the distances in the 3d configuration with the distances in the bacterial structure is lower  than that of the raw co-evolutionary distances  but still significant . the root mean square deviation  of the bacterial quaternary topology with the eukaryotic evolutionary configuration is  <dig>  Å, which compares well to the about  <dig> Å length of the matrix arm  <cit> . we subjected the evolutionary configuration to a principal component analysis and used the principal components thus obtained as new coordinate system for the configuration . the proximodistal axis of the matrix arm core corresponds to the first and largest principal component  and is thus correctly identified by the evolutionary model as the axis with the largest extent. the positioning of subunits along this axis is almost perfectly recovered by the evolutionary model . also the second axis shows a strong correlation  while the correlation along the third axis  is significant at a level of  <dig> % . the projection of the second and third axes  shows that among both the proximal q-module subunits and distal n-module subunits the evolutionary model identifies the correct circular ordering around the proximodistal axis. furthermore, in the predicted model, which is based on eukaryotic sequences only, the four q-module subunits  are twisted relative to the three n-module subunits  compared to the bacterial structure. interestingly, a twist in the same direction was observed in a comparison of the matrix arms of the eukaryote y. lipolytica and t. thermophilus : when looking from the matrix towards the membrane the n-module is turned clockwise relative to the q-module.

after the prediction of the topology of the seven matrix arm core subunits, we predicted the topology of the complete core of  <dig> matrix- and membrane arm subunits that are conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes. again, the co-evolutionary distances of the subunits can be well embedded in three dimensions  and result in a configuration with separate membrane and matrix arms . the rmsd of this evolutionary model and bacterial structure is  <dig>  Å, which corresponds to about 25% of the length of the membrane arm  <cit> . also in the complete-core model, the proximodistal axis of the matrix arm is recovered  although the rmsd of the matrix arm core subunits to the bacterial structure is lower  than that for the configuration that only contained matrix arm subunits . as expected from the correlation between the pairwise physical distances and their evolutionary correlation, the accuracy of the positioning in the membrane arm is poor . a closer inspection of the evolutionary model suggests that the membrane arm subunits are located as a cluster more sideways of the matrix arm than in the physical structure. in the superimposition of the two structures, this manifests in a tendency of the q-module away from the membrane and a slight tendency of the distal n-module towards the membrane.

eukaryotic complex i and assembly factors
although the structure of the  <dig> core subunits in bacteria is known  <cit>  and largely conserved in eukaryotes  <cit> , the arrangement of the mostly eukaryote-specific accessory subunits has not yet been resolved. furthermore, the transient nature of the interaction of assembly factors in complex i assembly intermediates hampers the identification of their binding sites in the complex. we therefore asked whether the positions of the accessory subunits and assembly factors could be identified from their evolutionary correlation. we extended the evolutionary 3d configuration to include  <dig> permanent subunits and  <dig> assembly factors of the human complex. both the goodness-of-fit of the 3d configuration with the raw co-evolutionary distances and the comparison with the reference structure, indicate the quality of this model. the goodness-of-fit measure p <dig>  which expresses how well the 3d model represents the pairwise co-evolutionary distances, is lower  than for the previous models. however, a comparison of this p3-value with the distribution of p3-values of  <dig> permuted symmetric matrices fitted in 3d  shows that the arrangement of the distances in the matrix fits significantly better in a 3d configuration than random arrangements . the co-evolutionary distances between the  <dig> proteins are thus highly consistent with a 3d representation. furthermore, the 3d configuration captures 72% of the variation in the co-evolutionary distances . in the comparison with the bacterial reference structure, the model of  <dig> proteins has a slightly lower rmsd  than the model of only  <dig> conserved subunits. the extended model clearly recapitulates a number of known elements of the physical structure of the complex . axis  <dig> in figure 3a separates the membrane arm  and matrix arm  subunits. among the membrane arm subunits of the iβ and iγ sub-complexes , axis  <dig> differentiates between subunits that tend to be encoded by the mitochondrial genome  and nuclear-encoded  subunits. the two subunits ndufb <dig>  and ndufc <dig>  are located somewhat separate from the remaining iβ subunits. among the matrix arm subunits, axis  <dig> differentiates between the distal n-module subunits v <dig>  v <dig>  and s <dig>  and the proximal q-module subunits s <dig> and s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig> . the accessory subunits of hydrophilic iλ matrix arm sub-complex  show a tendency towards the top, while those of the iα sub-complex that are not part of iλ  tend towards the membrane arm subunits at the bottom. the association of this latter group of subunits with the proximal matrix and membrane arm is strongly supported by experimental data . all assembly factors are located close to the matrix arm subunits. ndufaf <dig> , ndufaf <dig> , c8orf <dig> , c2orf <dig> , and nubpl  as well as the permanent subunits a <dig> and a <dig> sit on one side of the distal matrix arm core subunits v <dig>  v <dig>  and s <dig>  only c20orf <dig>  is placed close to the proximal matrix arm subunits s <dig>  s <dig>  and the proximal membrane arm subunits a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  assembly factor  <dig>  is positioned close to the iλ subunits s <dig> and a <dig> 

discussion
our results show that the evolutionary rates of complex i subunits contain a significant amount of information about the complex’s quaternary structure. for the matrix arm we found that about 61% of the correlation in evolutionary rate could be explained by the distances of the subunit centers. this is even more striking if we consider that the evolutionary model was derived from eukaryotic sequences and thus should reflect the matrix arm structure in eukaryotes, while our reference structure is from a bacterium. indeed, the evolutionary 3d model revealed a twist between the n-module and the q-module when compared to the bacterial structure, a finding that is supported by experimental data .

in the two models that include the membrane arm, mitochondria-encoded subunits were predicted to be separate from nucleus-encoded subunits, which is in line with previous results. the independent variation of evolutionary rates in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  may have contributed to the isolation of the mitochondria encoded subunits in our models. nevertheless, we stress that the position of the membrane arm core subunits, specifically at the proximal end of the matrix arm in both models, indicates a signal of the physical structure in the evolutionary correlation data. furthermore, the strict separation of the nucleus-encoded iβ subunits and their mitochondria-encoded counterparts nadh <dig> and  <dig> may be explained by other factors, as these two groups also behave differently in experiments  <cit> . interestingly, despite its nuclear encoding, the membrane-integral subunit ndufa <dig> of the iα sub-complex  <cit>  is positioned close to the membrane arm core, in particular close to nadh <dig> . in t. thermophilus, nadh <dig> is located between the two subunits nadh <dig> and nadh <dig>  <cit>  both of which are known physical interactors of ndufa <dig>  <cit> . a direct physical interaction of ndufa <dig> with nadh <dig> is therefore likely.

the evolutionary correlation failed to identify the correct topology of the membrane arm core. a number of biological reasons could explain such a lack of signal. first, long-range structural constraints  <cit>  may interfere with the distance-dependent structural constraints that are necessary for a distance-dependent strength of evolutionary rate correlation. second, the formation of oxphos super-complexes with complex i dimers may result in correlations between distant subunits. indeed, despite their positions at opposite ends of the membrane arm, nadh <dig> and  <dig> show a high correlation in evolutionary rates with each other and with subunit cytb of complex iii  <cit>  consistent with their proximity in oxphos complexes organized into respiratory strings  <cit> . third, the lack of correlation with physical distance may result from non-adaptive variation in the mitochondria-encoded genes caused by variable and, at least in some eukaryotic taxa, heterogeneous mutation-pressure  <cit> . indeed, in a number of animal taxa changes in gene order or mutation-pressure led to non-adaptive changes in mitochondrial genes  <cit> . the mitochondrial genomes of some taxa in our study, such as plants, are clearly different from those in animals  and their genes are likely under different mutation-pressures  <cit> . fourth, the embedding of the membrane proteins in two dimensions might reduce the evolutionary constraints to maintain interactions in comparison to proteins that are embedded in three dimensions.

the integration of multiple proteins in a single model assumes that the interactions are permanent and non-competitive. this is clearly not the case for the model of  <dig> proteins because it includes assembly factors. this model can therefore not exactly represent a physical structure. according to current models, complex i assembles from independent subcomplexes  <cit> . of the assembly factors required for this process and included in our study, only ndufaf <dig>  is required for the assembly of the distal membrane arm sub-complex  <cit> . in our model, af <dig> is located close to the matrix arm, which supports an indirect rather than a direct involvement of af <dig> in membrane arm assembly  <cit> . the distal membrane arm further combines with a pre-formed membrane-anchored proximal matrix/membrane arm that contains the subunits ndufs <dig>  and nadh <dig>  and possibly ndufs <dig>  and ndufs <dig>   <cit>  and whose assembly involves ndufaf <dig>  and possibly c8orf <dig>   <cit> . although the membrane-association of af <dig> and o <dig> is not reflected in our data, they form a tightly co-evolving triple with c2orf <dig> , which is known to bind the proximal matrix arm subunit s <dig>  <cit> . the high correlation in evolutionary rates between af <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> suggest strong selective constraints on their cooperation during the assembly of the proximal matrix/membrane arm sub-complex. the fourth assembly factor that has been experimentally linked to the proximal membrane arm, c20orf <dig>   <cit> , is indeed placed close to the proximal matrix arm subunits s <dig>  s <dig> , and the proximal membrane arm subunits a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  <cit> .

after the joining of the two membrane arm intermediates, the proximal matrix arm is further extended. this step involves the nubpl-mediated assembly of at least one fes-cluster into the distal matrix arm  <cit> . in the evolutionary configuration the assembly factor nubpl is positioned side by side with the permanent subunit ndufa <dig> . like nubpl, a <dig> is associated with the distal matrix arm  <cit> . the highly conserved a <dig> subunit is structurally similar to thioredoxin-like proteins with a loop-region of probably variable conformation that contains two cysteines in human   <cit> . these cysteines can form a revertible disulfide bridge with an in-vitro redox-potential in the range of the large majority of isopotential fes-clusters of complex i  <cit> . although the cysteines are not fully conserved, occasionally fes-clusters are bound by serine, histidine, or aspartate  <cit> . indeed, the human serine  <dig> in ndufa <dig> is a good candidate for fes-cluster binding because it is perfectly conserved in all species, with the notable exceptions of trypanosoma and leishmania, in which it is substituted by cysteine. together these observations and the very strong evolutionary rate correlation of a <dig> and nubpl support an involvement of a <dig> in complex i associated fes-cluster assembly or maintenance. the peripheral position of a <dig> and nubpl in the model could be a consequence of other strong evolutionary constraints not directly related to complex i.

also ndufaf <dig>  has been linked to the assembly of the distal matrix arm  <cit> . interestingly, the evolutionary data position af <dig> directly besides its paralog ndufa <dig>   <cit> . like af <dig>  a <dig> is known to be associated to the distal-matrix arm to which it is directly recruited from the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . the correlation in evolutionary rates and the independent co-loss in multiple complex i lacking taxa  <cit>  support an evolutionarily conserved functional relationship of af <dig> and a <dig>  it is tempting to speculate that af <dig> temporarily binds at the binding site of a <dig>  e.g. to stabilize the local structural context, and is later substituted by its paralog. such close positioning and physical interaction of homologous proteins within the same protein complex is one of the prevailing trends in the “fate” of duplicated proteins in complexes  <cit> . complex i appears to add another twist to this pattern in the sense that the predicted interaction is only temporary.

the rate of protein evolution is influenced by diverse factors  <cit> , in particular expression and general functional relatedness  <cit> . it is therefore even more remarkable that we found physical distance to be the major determinant of the evolutionary rate correlation for the complex i matrix arm. however, this result does not apply to the whole complex. thus, to establish whether the mirror-tree/mds combination is a good general method to predict quaternary structures, other complexes need to be analyzed. furthermore, instead of using the mirror-tree method one could use residue correlation to measure the co-evolution of subunits more directly. residue correlation has been used to predict contact interfaces for protein pairs  <cit>  and to investigate a rotation-symmetric homo-multimeric complex  <cit> . a simple implementation would be to integrate pairwise residue correlations  <cit>  or correlations that account for indirect correlations  <cit>  or phylogenetic dependency  <cit>  by in-silico two-hybrid  <cit>  into subunit distances and map these into three dimensions by multidimensional scaling.

CONCLUSIONS
the correlations of evolutionary rates between subunits of the eukaryotic complex i contain detailed information about the structural arrangement of the matrix arm subunits. this allowed us to make specific predictions about the positions of supernumerary subunits and assembly factors of the matrix arm, which may guide further experimental investigations. multidimensional scaling could not reconstruct the structure of the membrane arm core. a future analysis will have to investigate what may cause this lack a spatial signal along the membrane arm and thus clarify in particular the relevance of conformational dynamics and super-complex arrangement into a respiratory string for the sequence evolution of complex i.
