BACKGROUND
rice  is an important cereal species, and a staple food for more than half of the world’s population. during early growth stages, low temperature stress retards rice seedling establishment and plant development, directly impacting yield. temperate japonica cultivars generally have better seedling-stage cold tolerance  and greater seedling vigor than indica cultivars  <cit> . by using backcross breeding, however, we have recently identified the putative genetic networks underlying some introgression lines  with significantly improved ct at the seedling stage under a japonica restorer c <dig> background , suggesting the diversity hidden in the indica germplasm. further elucidation of the molecular basis of ct enhancement of japonica rice arising from introgression of favorable alleles from indica rice would provide rice breeders with much useful information.

cold stress tolerance mechanisms in plants include cold signal perception, activation of transcription factors  by signal transduction, and expression of cold-responsive genes for mediating stress tolerance  <cit> . the plant cell membrane represents an ideal location for the primary temperature stress sensor, because one of the immediate effects of temperature stress in plants is a change in membrane fluidity  <cit> . at low temperatures, greater membrane lipid unsaturation appears to be crucial to optimum membrane function. when the arabidopsis fatty acid deficient triple mutant fad3- <dig> fad7- <dig> fad <dig>  which is devoid of trienoic fatty acids, was exposed to prolonged low temperatures, a decrease in fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and thylakoid membrane content was observed compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . similarly, osfad <dig> has a functional role in maintaining levels of trienoic fatty acids and stress tolerance at low temperatures in rice  <cit> . in one study  <cit> , linolenic acid levels increased and palmitic acid levels decreased in cold tolerant rice genotypes exposed to chilling; the opposite behavior was observed in cold sensitive genotypes. transcriptional regulation is the core component of the complex genetic network associated with plant responses to cold. the c-repeat /dehydration responsive element -binding tf-mediated cold response pathway has been shown to play a predominant role in ct through the process of cold acclimation  <cit> . although rice, a plant of tropical and subtropical origin, lacks mechanisms for cold acclimation, it nonetheless possesses components of this cbf cold-response pathway  <cit> . osdreb1a and osdreb1b are induced by cold stress, and constitutive overexpression of these genes in transgenic arabidopsis and rice leads to induction of stress-responsive genes, increased high cold and salt tolerance, and growth retardation under normal conditions  <cit> . other important signaling pathways have also been shown to be involved in ct. for example, mybs <dig> represses the dreb1-dependent cold signaling pathway at the transcriptional level. dreb1- and mybs3-dependent pathways may complement each other and act sequentially to allow adaptation to immediate and persistent cold stress in rice  <cit> . the rice r2r3-type osmyb <dig> tf controls a hierarchical network comprising several regulatory sub-clusters associated with cellular defense and rescue, metabolism, and development. this network is independent of cbf/dreb, and its sub-regulons operate with possible co-regulators, including nuclear factor-y  <cit> . in addition, one ros -mediated regulon triggered by chilling stress is independent of abscisic acid  and cbf/dreb, and its activation promotes rapid response of rice seedlings to chilling stress  <cit> . finally, constitutive and non-cold responsive regulons, which have a differential effect on the cold responsive dre regulon, also play a key role in ct  <cit> .

dna microarray analysis is a well developed high-throughput technology that has been used for many genomic application areas, especially whole-genome gene expression profiling. although high-throughput rna sequencing has recently become popular as an alternative to microarray analysis, the microarray platform, with its robust sample process and data analysis pipelines, is still the preferred choice for transcriptomic profiling involving a large number of samples in model plants with well-annotated genomes  <cit> . many microarray-based studies have been carried out to identify abiotic stress responsive genes in specific rice varieties and transgenic rice  <cit> , and comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes under salinity and drought stress have revealed novel genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in stress tolerance  <cit> . unfortunately, it is difficult to use the stress-related genes uncovered in those studies to improve modern varieties in rice breeding, because most of them already exist in elite rice varieties.

in this study, a ct il and its cold sensitive recurrent parent were assessed in terms of their seedling growth and physiological responses to cold stress treatment. an affymetrix genome array was used to profile global gene expression changes under a cold stress time series. the results of this study should serve as an initial step in a comprehensive understanding of ct enhancement resulting from introgression of favorable alleles from indica rice into a japonica rice background.

RESULTS
phenotypic differences between the introgression line k <dig> and its recurrent parent c <dig> under cold stress
the ct il k <dig> and its recurrent parent c <dig>  which possesses a cold sensitive phenotype, were used in this study. under cold stress, a marked difference in survival rate was observed between k <dig> and c <dig> , with k <dig> showing better ct and recovery ability than c <dig>  seedling leaves of c <dig> exhibited obvious wilting, while only a few necroses on leaf tips were observed in k <dig> seedlings . compared with c <dig>  cold-treated k <dig> seedlings experienced significantly less extensive cell membrane injury  during the 24 h recovery period following the 48 h cold stress treatment . interestingly, although under control conditions k <dig> exhibited significantly lower superoxide dismutase  activity and soluble protein concentrations than c <dig>  after 48 h of cold stress these parameters increased dramatically and reached higher values, even with different changing trends, in k <dig> compared with c <dig> . in regard to catalase  activity, k <dig> showed a larger change than c <dig> after 48 h of cold stress . based on phenotypic and physiological traits measured in this study, the ct of k <dig> was indeed improved over that of c <dig>  due to the introgression of favorable alleles from indica donor bg <dig> into the japonica background.

genome-wide gene expression profiling of k <dig> and c <dig> under a cold stress time-series
comparison of genome-wide gene expression between two genotypes with contrasting ct phenotypes in a cold environment may help identify underlying molecular genetic pathways responsible for cold adaptation of rice plants. in this study, we use an affymetrix whole rice genome array to profile gene expression changes of k <dig> and c <dig> under cold stress at five time points . the array contained  <dig>  rice genome genes . among these genes,  <dig> – <dig>   were found to be expressed in at least one sample in both genotypes under stress or control conditions . a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified, including comprise  <dig> cold-responsive degs and  <dig> genotypic-specific degs . there were 232/ <dig>  286/ <dig>  503/ <dig>  1075/ <dig>  and 1962/ <dig> degs detected in samples of c418/k <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h, respectively, revealing that cold treatment induced a continuous increase in degs in both genotypes. there was an apparently delayed response to cold in k <dig> compared with c <dig>  with  <dig> degs in c <dig> vs  <dig> in k <dig> at 2 h cold stress. similar results were previously observed in rice under salinity stress; in that study, the sensitive genotype ir <dig> induced a relatively large number of genes compared to tolerant fl <dig>  <cit> . in addition, comparison of gene expression levels between k <dig> and c <dig> showed that there were  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in k <dig> compared with c <dig> under control conditions. this suggests that these genes may be responsible for k354’s intrinsic tolerance to cold stress, which may be largely derived from introgression of donor alleles conferring constitutive tolerance to low temperature.

note: degs were identified using the empirical criterion of more than 5-fold change and significant t tests  based on three independent biological replicates. induced or repressed genes were identified by comparing the transcription level of genes under stress condition with that under control conditions. significantly up- or down-regulated degs between k <dig> and c <dig> were detected by comparing the transcription level of genes between two genotypes at the same time point.

gene ontology  enrichment of all detected cold-responsive degs with known and putative functions is shown in figure  <dig>  the predominant degs were functionally involved in metabolism , such as macromolecule metabolism, oxidation-reduction, and primary metabolism; cellular processes , including microtubule-based processes; stimulus response ; binding activity , including ion, tetrapyrrole, and nucleotide binding; and catalytic activity , such as hydrolase, transferase, and oxidoreductase activity. go enrichment analysis of the  <dig> genotype-specific degs, however, indicated that the most prevalent degs were involved in programmed cell death   and electron carrier activity , revealing genotype-specific transcriptome changes in response to cold environmental stimuli.

on the basis of hierarchical average linkage cluster analysis , a transcript-level time-dependent cold response could be clearly delineated into early response , middle response , and late response  components. the samples from k <dig> and c <dig> formed separate and distinct clusters showing their genotype-specific responses to cold stress treatment. all  <dig> degs could be classified into six major groups based on their transcription patterns . two major deg groups shared by both genotypes were either induced  and repressed  by cold. clusters ii and iii represented non-cold-responsive degs that were expressed at significantly different levels between c <dig> and k <dig> under normal growth conditions. members of cluster iv were initially down-regulated but later induced in both genotypes during cold stress. interestingly, cluster vi comprised a set of genes that were initially induced and later repressed in k <dig> during stress . genes in clusters ii, iii, and vi may therefore be mainly responsible for the differential cold stress response between two genotypes, as discussed below.

using the sample cluster results ,  <dig> degs were randomly selected for qrt-pcr analysis to confirm the gene expression changes detected by microarray analysis. the high correlation  between microarray data and qrt-rcr expression values indicate that there was good agreement between both approaches .

time-dependent k <dig> and c <dig> gene expression changes in response to cold stress
to assess the differential transcriptome alterations of k <dig> and c <dig> under cold stress, degs at different time points were compared by venn diagram . figure 3a represents the results of comparing induced or repressed genes in c <dig> under cold stress during phases i, ii, and iii. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were continuously induced and repressed, respectively, in c <dig> during cold stress. moreover,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were induced, and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were repressed by cold in c <dig> specifically during phases i, ii, and iii, respectively. similarly, a small proportion of genes were stably regulated by cold during phases i and ii, but a larger number were exclusively regulated by cold during phase iii in k <dig> . these results indicate that in both genotypes most genes were regulated under later cold stress, implying that cold stress responsiveness increased with increasing treatment duration.

a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were commonly induced and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were commonly repressed by cold in both genotypes during phases i, ii, and iii, respectively . the large proportion of shared cold-regulated genes found in c <dig> and k <dig> suggests that the major genetic pathways associated with cold response are conserved in both genotypes, consistent with their mostly common genetic background, except for the introgressed genetic segments.

furthermore, a set of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as commonly induced and repressed genes, respectively, in both genotypes over the entire course of the cold treatment . among these,  <dig> tf genes from  <dig> families were induced, including  <dig> ap2-erebp genes,  <dig> myb genes,  <dig> wrky genes,  <dig> zim genes, and  <dig> c2h <dig> genes. ap2-erebp tfs, including dreb1a , dreb1b , dreb1c , dreb1f , dreb1g , erf <dig> , and  <dig> other ap <dig> domain-containing proteins, were found to be significantly up-regulated in both genotypes under cold stress. this suggests that the major cold-responsive genetic pathway shared by c <dig> and k <dig> is possibly a dreb1-related pathway. in addition, we detected an important subset of commonly induced genes related to signal transduction in both genotypes, including genes encoding five mapkkks, four calmodulin-related calcium sensor proteins, and one camk. all these results indicate that conserved transcription regulation and signal transduction pathways are involved in cold stress response in both genotypes.

unique functional categories of genotype-specific degs in k <dig> and c418
to identify genotype-specific degs, we used the following criterion: any gene with more than 5-fold change found only in c <dig> or k <dig> at one or more cold-responsive stages was regarded as a c <dig> or k <dig> specifically-regulated gene set. after removing redundancies,  <dig> and  <dig> cold-responsive degs were specifically identified in c <dig> and k <dig>  respectively . go analysis was performed using zheng’s method  <cit>  to functionally classify the genotype-specific degs regulated by cold and constitutive degs. there were  <dig> genes determined to be exclusively induced by cold stress in k <dig> ; their dominant go categories were metabolic, cellular, stimulus response, and cellular component organization processes. the 95 k354-specific genes  repressed by cold stress were largely involved in oxidation reduction processes and oxidative stress responses.

in c <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as specifically induced and repressed under cold stress, respectively . for the induced gene set, the most prevalent go categories were oxidation-reduction , trehalose metabolic processes , and lipid transport . genes repressed exclusively by cold were involved in transmembrane transport , protein folding , oligopeptide transport , and l-methionine salvaging from methylthioadenosine . the opposite transcription pattern observed for genes related to oxidation regulation can be partly explained by genetic differences in ct between the two genotypes. it has been suggested that oxidation regulation is involved in cold response  <cit> , but whether high levels of antioxidant enzyme activity under cold stress are positively related to ct is presently unknown.

among the constitutively highly expressed genes in k <dig> ,  <dig> genes were found to be non-responsive to cold stress, indicating an active role in ct in k <dig>  all of these  <dig> genes were included in cluster ii . go enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were functionally involved in endogenous stimulus , protein modification , signal transduction , cell differentiation , and amino acid and derivative metabolism . strikingly, ten genes with higher basal expression in k <dig> were related to pcd , and all of them were disease-resistance related genes with an nbs domain . it has been reported that cell death pathways in plants can be activated not only by successful recognition of a pathogen during hypersensitive responses but also by a range of abiotic stresses  <cit> . in addition, pcd has been reported to be activated in tobacco cells in response to cold stress  <cit> . furthermore, signal-induced plant pcd can be caused by reactive oxygen species generated by biotic and abiotic stresses, and can be perceived by the nbs domain  <cit> . in addition, in our study the rice omega- <dig> desaturase gene osfad <dig>  was  <dig> times more up-regulated in k <dig> than in c <dig> under control conditions. rice has only one trienoic acid, linolenic acid, which is produced from linoleic acid by omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  <cit> . increased linolenic acid levels are essential for the maintenance of membrane fluidity and chloroplast function at low temperatures  <cit> . transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing atfad <dig> have been reported to exhibit chilling tolerance  <cit> . we also observed that up-regulation of a cell wall-associated receptor kinase  was  <dig> times greater in k <dig> than in c <dig> under control and cold stress conditions. through an extracellular domain, wall-associated kinases physically link the plasma membrane to the cell wall matrix. they also have the potential to directly signal cellular events through their cytoplasmic kinase domain, which is one of the most likely candidates participating in cell wall-cytoplasm signaling in plant defense reactions  <cit> . all of these results suggest that the higher activity of defensive proteins and membrane fluidity under control conditions might be involved in ct in k <dig> 

the dreb <dig> regulon plays an important role in cold stress response in both genotypes
of the  <dig> known or annotated tf genes in the rice gnome  <cit> ,  <dig>  were observed to be differentially regulated by cold in this study . these tf genes include  <dig> ap2/erebp,  <dig> bhlh,  <dig> hsf,  <dig> myb,  <dig> nac, and  <dig> wrky genes. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tf genes were identified as k354-specific, c418-specific, or commonly regulated by cold, respectively. interestingly, five commonly regulated tfs  in both genotypes were previously reported to be regulated by cold-induced expression of osmyb <dig> <cit> , suggesting that a dreb/cbf-independent osmyb <dig> cold-regulated pathway exists in c <dig> and k <dig> 

the osdreb <dig> regulon has been shown to play an important role in conferring cold stress response in rice  <cit> . osdreb1s belong to a sub-family of ap2/erebp proteins unique to plants and sharing a highly conserved ap <dig> domain. to identify commonly cold-induced genes within the osdreb <dig> regulon, we examined cis-regulatory elements in the 1-kb upstream regions of  <dig> commonly induced genes in both genotypes using the dre core motif a/gccgac  <cit> . of these genes,  <dig>  contained at least one dre core motif in the 1-kb upstream region . as shown in figure 4a, expression patterns of the osdreb <dig> regulon  were roughly consistent with that of three osdreb <dig> genes . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> had been previously shown to be co-expressed with osdreb <dig> in other rice microarray experiments using a positive correlation coefficient of  <dig>  as the cutoff on the tigr website  <cit>  . osdreb1a and osdreb1b were induced by cold with a similar expression pattern but osdreb1c was expressed differentially during phase i  between the two genotypes . interestingly, analysis of gene expression profiles revealed the existence of an osdreb1c-specific regulon, which included  <dig> genes exclusively regulated by osdreb1c,  accounting for the main difference in the osdreb <dig> regulon between two genotypes. these results indicate that the dreb <dig> regulon plays an important role in cold stress response in both genotypes, even though there are a few genes, such as the osdreb1c regulon, whose regulation is unique to genotype-specific pathways.

co-localization of cold-responsive degs and introgressed chromosome segments in k354
based on the genotyping results, there were  <dig> introgressed chromosome segments in k <dig> that differed from c <dig> . a number of quantitative trait loci  related to ct have been mapped by different research groups  <cit> , among them,  <dig> qtls that were co-localized onto the  <dig> introgressed chromosome regions in k <dig>  we correspondingly mapped  <dig> degs onto these introgressed regions .

there were  <dig> degs co-mapped onto an introgressed region of chromosome  <dig> where two major ct qtls were previously identified  <cit>  . among these degs, two genes encoding the transcriptional regulator sir <dig> protein  and protein phosphatase 2c were highly enriched in k <dig>  according to go analysis, sir <dig> is related to epigenetic function , and the protein phosphatase 2c is involved in stress signaling  <cit> . these two genes are candidates for the ct qtl. in addition, most of the degs co-localized on the introgressed segment of chromosome  <dig> were found to be functionally associated with stress response. these genes include genes encoding cytochrome p450s, terpene synthase, nb-arc domain containing protein, histone deacetylase, and tf oswrky <dig>  importantly, there was only one candidate gene, osfad <dig>  found in the introgressed region near rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . osfad <dig> has been reported to be highly induced by extreme temperature, and is involved in membrane stability  <cit> , indicating it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane fluidity in k <dig> under cold stress. degs on the introgressed regions of rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> were largely related to signal transduction cascades. these genes included genes encoding terpene synthase , protein phosphatase 2c , and receptor-like kinase ossik <dig> , which are known to be strongly associated with abiotic stress response  <cit> . strikingly, a gene cluster containing four pcd-related genes were co-localized on the introgressed region of chromosome  <dig> , indicating their distinct role in ct of k <dig>  these degs may serve as functional candidate genes for the identification of a qtl for ct. by combining further functional identification and qtl fine mapping, the co-localized degs detected in this microarray analysis may provide the basis for gene cloning and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for ct in rice.

one objective of this study was an attribution of the differences between c <dig> and k <dig> transcriptomes to differences in ct between the two genotypes. these differences, whether at the transcription or phenotypic level, can only be caused by introgressed fragments from bg <dig>  an indica variety. although japonica varieties are generally known to be more tolerant to cold stress than indica varieties, we have shown in this study that some ct alleles are “hidden” in the indica background. this means that the ct effect of the alleles may not be favorable in indica, but when introgressed into a different background , the allele may manifest a different pattern. because the genomes of c <dig> and k <dig> are almost identical, any transcriptomic differences between the two genotypes must be due to the presence of fragments introgressed from bg <dig>  whether caused by direct allelic replacement or genome-wide transcriptome reconfiguration as a result of the replacement. comparison of c <dig> and k <dig> transcriptomes can therefore reduce background noise from bg <dig>  although we did not do so in this study, the question of which process, i.e., direct allelic replacement or genome-wide transcriptome reconfiguration, is responsible for transcriptome changes between c <dig> and k <dig> could be resolved by adding bg <dig> to the transcriptome comparison.

many k354-specific expressed genes that were not mapped onto or near introgressed regions may also play a vital role in ct, possibly through regulation by co-localized degs. by this we mean that a large number of genes involved in a signaling pathway related to a certain trait may be activated by expression of upstream genes. due to the low resolution of the limited ssr markers, we can only roughly estimate the length of the introduced fragments. it is worth noting, however, that whole genomic re-sequencing for k <dig> and c <dig> is underway. we believe the re-sequencing results will provide more detailed and precise information regarding the introgressed chromosomal segments. fine-mapping of these segments is necessary to more precisely identify the functional candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS
using expression profiling with an affymetrix rice genome array, we found that at the seedling stage the ct il k <dig> and its recurrent parent c <dig> exhibited a diverse whole genome-wide transcriptional response under both control and cold stress conditions. we detected  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated under cold stress, accounting for approximately 6% of total genes on the rice microarray chip. a large proportion of genes, including dreb <dig> and osmyb <dig> regulons, were determined to be commonly regulated by cold in both genotypes. expression of cold-responsive genes specific to the cold-tolerant genotype k <dig> may be affected by introgressed chromosome segments, and these genes may contribute to the increased ct of k <dig>  among genes co-localizing with introgressed chromosomal segments from the indica donor parent were genes involved in pcd, which were constitutive but had higher absolute expression levels in the il than in the japonica recurrent parent, and some differentially induced genes likely to be involved in the regulation of membrane biogenesis. our results represent a preliminary elucidation of genotype-dependent ct enhancement mechanisms, and may contribute to the improvement of ct in japonica rice using indica germplasm. functional validation of ct related genes identified in this study, however, is still required to provide more useful information for ct improvement in japonica rice molecular breeding.
