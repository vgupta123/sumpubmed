BACKGROUND
bivalves and mitochondrial dna
in animals, the mitochondrial genome  is typically a small, circular and compact molecule, generally encoding for  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> rrnas, and  <dig> trnas  <cit> . even if striking exceptions to this standard are known  <cit> , most differences among animal mtdnas involve gene content and arrangement.

mollusks have shown high variability in mitochondrial genome architecture  <cit> , with respect to many genomic features, i.e. length, gene arrangement, strand assignment, gene duplications and losses, nucleotide composition, and more. within mollusks, gastropods and bivalves show extensive variations, even with differences within the same family or genus  <cit> . furthermore, a major peculiar trait of mitochondrial genome in some bivalve species is the presence of an alternative pattern of mitochondrial inheritance known as doubly uniparental inheritance or dui  <cit> , that involves two separate lineages of mtdnas. one mitochondrial genome  is transmitted from the mother to the complete offspring, whereas the other one  is transmitted from the father to sons, where it localizes in germline and, therefore, in sperm. still, differences in gene order were also detected between the two dui-related lineages within the same species  <cit> .

mitochondrial gene order has been shown to be a good marker for phylogenetic relationships, because rearrangements are random discrete events, and retro-mutation is very unlikely . this is even more true for arrangements of protein coding or rrna genes, because they are much rarer than the ones involving trnas  <cit> .

tracing the “archaic” mtdna gene arrangement of mollusca, we can start from groups sequenced so far seeming to retain most ancestral features. among them, chitons are aculiferan mollusks that are considered sister group to all conchiferans, which include scaphopods, cephalopods, gastropods, and bivalves . for pcgs and rrnas, the gene arrangement of the chiton katharina tunicata <cit>  is also shared by haliotis, a primitive gastropod  <cit> ; a single inversion separates it from the gene arrangement of caenogastropoda ; few steps are required to transform the gene order of katharina in that of nautilus, a primitive cephalopod  <cit> . a single translocation also separates it from the aplacophoran c. nitidulum . moreover, the gene arrangement of katharina tunicata shows some outstanding similarities to lophophorates and even arthropods  <cit> . this clearly points out that katharina may have the most “archaic” gene order known so far among mollusca, and maybe the ancestral mollusk gene arrangement  <cit> .

many exceptions to typical gene content are known: f.i., it is well known that the atp <dig> gene has been reported as missing in several bivalve species, as discussed in . atp <dig> is present on the same strand in all unionoida ; as a single exception, it is incomplete in the male mtdna of pyganodon grandis <cit> . moreover, it has been found in some heterodonts, like loripes lacteus , lucinella divaricata , meretrix lamarckii <cit> , and meretrix lusoria <cit> ; a putative atp <dig> has also been recently reported from the mytilid musculista senhousia <cit> . conversely, it was not recovered in the mactrid coelomactra antiquata <cit> .

among the other exceptions to gene features and content, the rrns gene is duplicated in some species of genus crassostrea, while the rrnl gene is split in two separate fragments in all ostreids known to date ; finally, two versions of cox <dig> were found in the musculista senhousia m mtdna  <cit> .

the taxonomic position of solemya
despite sharing a common bivalve shell, two major kind of bivalvian mollusks are known. the first group, the opponobranchia, including most of the protobranchiate bivalves, is generally deemed to retain many ancestral features, while the second, the autobranchia, i.e. lamellibranch bivalves with completely functional filter-feeding gills, is a big assemblage of species showing a more derived morphology, when compared to putative ancestral mollusks. among bivalves, complete mitochondrial genomes are nowadays available for autobranchia only, which show many differences with respect to the condition of k. tunicata.

in the subclass opponobranchia there are basically two groups of living bivalves: nuculida and solemyida. the genus solemya and relatives have edentulous or nearly edentulous, generally equivalved shells, with an homogeneous aragonitic ostracum, a glossy, thick and brown periostracum, and the mollusk shows a broad fringe, siphonate mantle and burrowing habits  <cit> . most solemyids are involved in symbiosis with chemoautotrophic, gill-hosted, bacteria, enabling life in unusual habitats like deep-sea vents  <cit> .

in this paper, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome of a representative of opponobranchia, the atlantic awning clam solemya velum say,  <dig>  this organelle genome was completely annotated and compared to other available bivalve and conchiferan complete mitochondrial genomes. because of the sister-group relationship between opponobranchia and autobranchia, the characteristics of the solemya mitogenome have proved useful to compare bivalve mtdna features with those of other mollusks. in this paper we discuss our findings with particular reference to:  the presence of the atp <dig> gene;  nucleotide composition;  strand patterns;  origin of replication;  supranumerary orfs;  gene arrangement.

methods
dna extraction, long-pcr reactions and sequencing
specimens of solemya velum were collected by and commercially purchased at the woods hole oceanographic institution  in summer  <dig>  a standard phenol:chloroform protocol was used to extract total genomic dna from a pool of  <dig> individuals, because of the small dimensions of the obtained specimens.

the technique of long-pcr amplification, paired with sequencing with primer-walking or shotgun cloning, was used to amplify the complete mitochondrial genome in several overlapping fragments. the herculase® ii fusion enzyme  kit was used to perform long-pcr reactions up to  <dig>  bp. the reaction conditions were set as follows: 10 μl 5× herculase® ii fusion reaction buffer, nucleotides 250 μm each, primers  <dig>  μm each,  <dig>  μl herculase® ii fusion, 5 μl template dna, ddh2o up to 50 μl. cycle conditions were set up as an initial denaturation step at 92°c for 2′, 40 cycles of denaturation at 92°c for 10′, annealing at 48-52°c for 30'', and extension at 68°c for 10', and a final extension step of 68°c for 8′. primers used for long-pcr were used to sequence long amplicons and new internal specific primers to complete primer-walking were designed with primer <dig> online tool  <cit> .

routine pcr amplification was performed for amplicons < <dig>  bp with gotaq® flexi dna polymerase  as in  <cit> . amplicons were purified through peg precipitation  <cit> , or with wizard® sv gel and pcr clean-up system ; when necessary, they were ligated into a pgem® t-easy vector  and transformed into max efficiency® dh5α™ chemically competent cells  as in  <cit> . additional files  <dig> and  <dig> list all primers used for this study. all sequencing reactions were carried out through the macrogen europe  facility. only in the case of long-pcr with primers coi2f and solemya_3a1894r , the  <dig>  bp long amplicon was purified with 5% peg precipitation  <cit>  and sequenced via shotgun cloning. this was carried out by macrogen korea .

sequence annotation
protein-coding genes were annotated using the online orf finder tool  <cit> ; the software glimmer  <dig>   <cit>  under iterated pipeline for assessing orf features was used to confirm results; homology search was carried out with blast . we investigated structures and putative functions of unknown orfs through the @tome  <dig>   and interproscan  online tools: signal peptides were sought with signalp  <cit> , while similarities were detected using hhsearch  <cit> , sp <dig> <cit>  and fugue  <cit> .

start codons of pcgs were set at the first start codon found by orf finder that did not overlap with an upstream gene; whenever a stop codon was overlapping with a following gene, it was moved backwards to the first suitable codon starting with t/ta . in cases of neighboring pcgs, these in silico predictions were tested looking for a secondary structure with a possible cleavage signaling function in the connecting region, using the mfold server  <cit>  and a folding temperature of 14°c. trna genes were predicted with trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit>  and arwen  <dig>   <cit> . the mfold server was used to predict the secondary structure of unassigned regions; all secondary structures were graphically edited with varna  <dig>   <cit> .

codon usage and nucleotide composition statistics were computed using mega  <dig>   <cit>  and microsoft excel® 2007; repeated sequences were found with spectral repeat finder v  <dig>   <cit> . the mitochondrial genome map was prepared using genomevx  <cit> , setting cox <dig> as the starting point of the mtdna and labeling its coding strand as “ + ”.

phylogenetic analysis
complete mitochondrial genomes of bivalves and other mollusks were downloaded from genbank in november  <dig> . summarizing, we included in our dataset  <dig> bivalves,  <dig> gastropods,  <dig> cephalopods,  <dig> scaphopod,  <dig> polyplacophoran,  <dig> chaetodermomorph, and the polychaete outgroup platynereis dumerilii <cit> . we assessed phylogenetic representativeness of this sample through the avtd method as in  <cit> . we used the software phyre  <cit>  and set the number of splits, merges, and moves to  <dig>  shuffling at the family level. sequences were managed through clc sequence viewer  <dig> . <dig> , microsoft excel®  <dig>  and mega  <dig> .

each gene, with the exception of atp <dig>  was separately translated into amminoacids and aligned with mafft  <dig>  <cit>  and muscle  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , using the m-coffee merging algorithm  <cit> . gblocks  <cit>  was used to select blocks of conserved positions suitable for phylogenetic analysis under default  conditions.

partitionfinderprotein  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , using the greedy option and bayesian information criterion , tested the best partitioning scheme of our dataset, which was chosen for subsequent analysis, as well as the concatenated alignment and the completely partitioned model. best-fitting amminoacid substitutions models were selected with prottest  <dig>  , through phyml  <cit>  and bic for model selection.

the software raxml  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used for maximum likelihood analyses, using both the fast  and the standard  bootstrap algorithm with  <dig> replicates. the protcat model  <cit>  was implemented for optimization of individual per-site substitution rates, using models suggested by prottest  <dig> . trees were graphically edited by phylowidget  <cit> , dendroscope  <cit> , and inkscape softwares.

RESULTS
genomic features
the complete mitochondrial genome of solemya velum was found to be  <dig>  bp long. it was deposited into genbank database under accession number . all genes of the standard metazoan mitochondrial genome were found, including the atp <dig> gene . with the only exception of trnt, genes are organized in a large cluster on the “ + ” strand  and in a slightly shorter cluster on the “-” strand .  <dig> trnas are present: as usual for animal mtdna, two serine-encoding trnas, trns <dig> and trns <dig>  and two leucine-encoding trnas, trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> were found. the secondary structure of trna genes was predicted and is shown in additional file 4; as expected  <cit> , trns <dig> presents a reduced dhu arm.

nucleotide composition and a-t/g-c proportions were computed for each single gene and for pcgs, third codon positions, ribosomal genes, trnas, and urs taken as a whole : the total a-t content of s. velum mitochondrial genome is  <dig> %. a chi-square test with  <dig> d. f. demonstrated that the a-t composition of s. velum mtdna is significantly different from that of other bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods , and k. tunicata ; however, no significant difference was found with mtdna a-t composition of c. nitidulum  and cephalopoda .

a-t content and a-t/g-c skew are shown in figure  <dig> for s. velum and three other mollusks for comparison: katharina tunicata , unio pictorum , and meretrix petechialis . a-t content is often similar to that of k. tunicata , while skews, at the genomic level, are more similar to those of u. pictorum. we also plotted the a-c and the g-t content along the mitochondrial genome  with a sliding window of 151 bp . overall, there is bias towards neither pair, but we evidenced a region of high a-c content spanning approximately from the atp <dig> to the rrnl gene, i.e. part of the mitochondrial genome where all genes are on the “-” strand.

the most common start codon  is atg , but also alternative codons were detected, in accordance with previous findings in different invertebrates  <cit> . most probably, truncated stop codon are used in three genes, namely nad3/nad <dig>  and cytb . as already shown , these are common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, with taa stop codon subsequently restored by post-transcriptional polyadenilation. in five cases , two pcgs are not separated by any trna and are neighboring: in all cases, a stem-loop structure with a putative cleavage function of the polycistronic primary transcript has been found . s. velum mtdna contains  <dig>  codifying codons, whose usage is shown in additional file  <dig>  most used codon is uua , while less used codon is cgc . the commonest amminoacid is leucine, while the rarest is cysteine.

the third base of the codon is most often an a  or a t , whereas c  and g  are less represented in this position. this may simply relate to the degeneracy of the mitochondrial code, but it is possible that natural selection is even looser in these positions because of a wobble effect: as already reported for other metazoans , only some codons in the pcgs do have their relative trna/anticodon on the mtdna .

we found precise patterns of nucleotide content in four-fold degenerate third codon position along the mtdna molecule . we used all the pcgs as a possible starting point for the analysis and best results were obtained when cox <dig> was used as the first gene in the analysis. all the correlations were found to be significant with the exception of c content .

unassigned regions
relatively few unassigned regions  are present in the mitochondrial genome of s. velum . most of them are between  <dig> and 31 bp, but the largest ones are ur <dig>  and ur <dig> , between the trne/trng and trnk/trna gene pairs, respectively.

the putative secondary structures of ur <dig> and ur <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  ur <dig> folds as a double hairpin; ur <dig> folds in a more complex pattern, with several stem-and-loop substructures. a repeated 17-bp long motif was found in this region , starting at bases  <dig> and  <dig> of ur <dig> sequence. both ur <dig> and ur <dig> have a high a-t content , making of ur <dig> the a-t-richest region in the genome.

two small orfs of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides were found within ur <dig> and were called orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively. orf <dig> starts at nucleotide  <dig>   and ends at  <dig>   on the “ + ” strand; according to glimmer results, orf <dig> has a “raw” scoring value of  <dig> , which is comparable with that of other pcgs, like nad4l and nad <dig> . a blast search could find a possible homolog within the putative control region of haliotis rubra <cit> , which was also confirmed by glimmer. the a-t content of orf <dig> is  <dig> % and the most used codon is uuu , with  <dig> hits.

orf <dig> starts at nucleotide  <dig>   and ends at  <dig>   on the “-” strand. orf <dig> was not confirmed by glimmer, but signalp could retrieve a weak similarity with a signal peptide in the first  <dig> amminoacids of the putative translated protein; the a-t content of orf <dig> is  <dig> % and the most used codon is aaa , with  <dig> hits.

interproscan with tmhmm  <dig>  online tool could not identify any domain within orf <dig>  while a transmembrane domain was found within orf <dig> . using the @tome  <dig>  server, hhsearch, sp <dig> and fugue could find some similarities between orf <dig> and the dna-binding domains of some proteins ; hhsearch and fugue also showed homology of orf <dig> with two membrane-linked proteins .

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic representativeness of our sample of mollusk mitogenomes is shown in additional file  <dig>  using the original mollusk master list as published by  <cit> , the avtd of our sample is lying exactly on the mean avtd of  <dig> random subsamples of equal size  and it is above the highest random result  if a change in underlying taxonomy is simulated.

the overall length of concatenated alignment, after gblocks masking, was of  <dig>  amminoacids and the nad4l gene was completely excluded from the analysis, lacking suitable blocks. the software partitionfinderprotein selected a 3-blocks model: the first cluster was atp6-cytb-nad2-nad3-nad4-nad5; the second one was cox1-cox2-cox3-nad1; the nad <dig> gene was given its own partition. all models selected by prottest and piped to raxml are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the six ml searches converged on similar trees: following the partitioning scheme selected by partitionfinderprotein and using the complete bootstrap procedure we obtained the tree shown in figure  <dig>  katharina tunicata is the sister taxon of all other mollusks; a node with low bootstrap support  separates solemya +  from  + . in this scenario, both bivalvia and gastropoda seem polyphyletic, but deep nodes are weakly supported . conversely, cephalopoda, heterobranchia, amarsipobranchia sensu <cit> , palaeoheterodonta, and caenogastropoda were recovered as monophyletic with high bs.

gene order
as expected from the high plasticity of molluscan  mitochondrial genomes, many differences were found between s. velum and other mollusks’ gene arrangement. however, we found that katharina tunicata and haliotis rubra  share the same gene order  and, more interestingly, that this gene order is highly similar to that of s. velum, the only difference being an event of inversion of the atp8-atp6-nad5-nad4-nad4l cluster . if trnas were taken into account, this inversion would hold true . the same inversion event can be partially recovered in the unpublished partial mitochondrial genome of the opponobranchiate nucula nucleus , which is available in genbank under the accession number .

discussion
gene content
the solemya mtdna contains all genes of the standard metazoan mitochondrial genome . it is tempting to conclude that the loss/degeneracy of atp <dig> is restricted to amarsipobranchia, given the presence of this gene in palaeoheterodonts and in s. velum . whether the absence of atp <dig> gene is real or just an outcome of incorrect annotations , its presence in a bivalve like solemya further supports, if necessary, that the ancestral bivalve condition is the retention of a fully functional atp <dig> gene.

moreover, it is common in metazoans to find neighboring atp <dig> and atp <dig> on the same strand  <cit>  and it has been suggested that uncleaved transcripts may be co-translated  <cit> . tough this arrangement is not found in many phyla, like plathyhelminthes, nematoda, annelida, sipunculida, brachiopoda, and mollusca , nevertheless atp <dig> and atp <dig> are neighboring in s. velum . the same association can be found in basal mollusks, like c. nitidulum and k. tunicata, and in other conchiferans, like cephalopods , caenogastropoda, and heterobranchia .

genome features
mean a-t content in main molluscan classes ranges between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % : s. velum has a high a-t content , being significantly more similar to aculiferans and cephalopods than to other bivalves : actually, the a-t content of autobranchia is between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . irrespective of the functional constraints and gene features, we found an unbiased, when not low, g-t content in the “ + ” strand . most commonly, the leading strand is g-t rich . the g-t content is not particularly high in any region of the s. velum “ + ” strand, and it even drops to very low values where the molecule encodes pcgs on the “-” strand .

all genes are located on the same strand in amarsipobranchia, and most of them in palaeoheterodonta. contrastingly, in solemya velum, genes are evenly distributed among “ + ” and “-” strands, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. even if a h-biased distribution of genes is found in other lophotrochozoans, like annelids, brachiopods, bryozoans and platyhelminths , an even distribution is the commonest situation among mollusca  and, notably, as for a-t content, s. velum is quite similar to caudofoveata, cephalopoda, polyplacophora, and scaphopoda. this gene distribution on both strands rises a stimulating question on strand assignment: which is the leading  strand in s. velum? patterns evidenced in s. velum resemble those of n. macromphalus <cit> . contrarily, a strand with a sharper g-t predominance has been signaled, f.i., in some gastropods  <cit>  and in katharina <cit> . it seems that mtdnas with most genes on the same strand  tend to have higher g-t values than mtdnas with genes evenly distributed on either strand .

control region and origins of replication
the animal mtdna control region  should contain or neighbor the origins of replication .  <cit>  and, specifically for bivalves, breton and colleagues  proposed several parameters to annotate the cr, like  ur length,  evidence for secondary structure with t-rich loops,  high a-t content and  repetitive elements and palindromes. the best candidates for s. velum control region are the unassigned regions ur <dig> and ur <dig> , but, as expected, they give no blast hits with putative crs of other mollusks. among the two largest urs, ur <dig> is the longest unassigned region. both urs evidenced complex putative secondary structures ; again, both urs have a high a-t content, but while the a-t content of ur <dig> is  <dig> % , it is up to  <dig> % for ur <dig>  much more than other putative crs of mollusks  <cit> . on the other side, the only 17 bp-long repeated motif found in these urs was found in ur <dig>  so, based on the above mentioned characteristics, it is not possible to unambiguously assign the cr function to either ur.

 <cit>  suggested that mutations at four-fold degenerate sites should be completely neutral, being positions under no or limited selection. therefore, in absence of selective constraints, the heavy  strand would accumulate g and t at these sites, while the light  strand would accumulate a and c. consequently, a-t and g-c skews at the four-fold degenerate codon sites are known to be significantly correlated with the single-strand duration during duplication, and therefore with the position of each pcg with respect to the or of that strand  <cit> . precise linear patterns of the percentages of each of the  <dig> nucleotides were found when cox <dig> was used as the starting point , being the correlation significant for  <dig> nucleotides out of  <dig>  the slope was positive for a and c, and negative for g and t. this is very similar to the findings of  <cit>  for mammals and  <cit>  for vermetid gastropods. these data finally point to three conclusions:  the strand we call “ + ”  is the heavy  strand, while the strand we call “-” is the light  strand;  the cr of s. velum mtdna is located immediately before cox <dig> in the ur <dig> region;  as ur <dig> is located at the h/l switch, we suggest this to be the or of both strands, working in either direction.

the region of the putative or of the h strand encompasses ur <dig> and a cassette of trnas on the “-” strand, namely trnm, trnc, trny, trnw, trnq, and trne, a situation already signaled in the family vermetidae  <cit>  and in the unionid inversidens japanensis <cit> . as shown by  <cit> , trnas on one strand can sometimes work as or in the opposite one by forming alternative secondary structures other than conventional cloverleaves. further comparison with other bivalves is tricky because all genes are on the same strand within amarsipobranchia, but, similarly, the cr of mytilus spp. is located after a group of  <dig> trnas and the rrnl gene  <cit> ; the major non-coding region  of mimachamys nobilis is located after a cassette of  <dig> trnas  <cit> ; the cr of meretrix spp. is located after  <dig> consecutive trnas  <cit> .

the supranumerary orfs within ur8
if ur <dig> is the putative cr on solemya mtdna, the function of ur <dig> remains unknown. its length and secondary structure may have some kind of signaling function, but it is quite noteworthy that two orfs were found here: orf <dig> and orf <dig>  are they functional or not? remarkably, they span over the almost complete ur <dig>  leaving only small unassigned nucleotide stretches of  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 bp, similar to other intergenic spacers in s. velum mtdna .

orf <dig> has a glimmer “raw” score comparable to other pcgs of s. velum mtdna . although it is nested in the a-t rich ur <dig> , it has a lower a-t content , so that its composition is actually different from the rest of the ur <dig>  moreover, notwithstanding the low  a-t content, the most used codon is uuu , which is also among the most used ones in all pcgs of this mtdna, and therefore its codon composition is similar to that of other pcgs. the nucleotide pattern at four-fold degenerate sites is also consistent with other pcgs . finally, orf <dig> is almost completely located in a region of ur <dig> with few secondary structures . the presence of an homolog of orf <dig> in the putative cr of haliotis rubra, a species that, as above mentioned, seems to retain most ancestral features of molluscan mtdna  <cit> , may be related to a common origin of this orf.

conversely, orf <dig> is not found by glimmer and has a higher a-t content than orf <dig> ; consistently, the most used codon is aaa . however, possible homology of orf <dig> with membrane proteins is confirmed to some extent by the finding of a large transmembrane domain; the presence of a signal peptide constitutes a further in silico evidence favoring the functionality of this orf.

it is not easy to assign to a protein a functional role only relying on bioinformatics data: expectedly, given the low homology scores and the short length of both orfs, many different kinds of proteins and ligands were suggested by tools hosted on the @tome  <dig>  server. the presence of supranumerary orfs in mitochondrial genomes has been reported elsewhere  and they mostly are of obscure function, but they generally share either a dna-binding motif or a transmembrane region.

the commonest hit of orf <dig> was with dna-binding domains of other polypeptides, and many of them were top-ranked using the alignments scores as a sorting criterion. the putative transmembrane region of orf <dig> is  <dig> amminoacids long and it is found in the n-terminal part of the peptide; it is followed by  <dig> positively charged amminoacids  out of  <dig> in the c-terminal half of the protein. interestingly, this architecture is the same described by  <cit>  for supranumerary sex-linked orfs in unionid mitochondrial genomes. breton and colleagues suggest a possible role for these orfs, which must be involved in the complex machinery of the dui mechanism. present findings may confirm their claim that natural selection is working on maintaining the structure, rather than the sequence, of transmembrane supranumerary mitochondrial orfs  <cit> .

the presence of a putative transmembrane signaling peptide in orf <dig> and the dna-binding signal in orf <dig> may suggest a regulatory role for both these proteins; moreover, their presence in the s. velum mtdna might constitute an evidence of the ancestral presence of such supranumerary orfs in all bivalves. however, it has to be noted that this remains an in silico analysis and that some features of orf <dig> could be randomly due to the high a-t content : therefore, detailed analyses of mrna gene expression are required to shed light on these issues.

phylogenetic analysis and the usefulness of mitochondrial markers
the position of solemya is unexpected, being nested within gastropoda in our tree. however, node support is evidently very low , so our analysis does not point to a diphyly of bivalvia, but rather to a polytomy at the base of the tree, including solemya, katharina and haliotis. we may suggest that the lineage leading to opponobranchia arose so early in the molluscan radiation that little or no phylogenetic signal of this event may be retrievable in solemya mtdna. the structural similarities of solemya mtdna to haliotis and katharina, and the huge differences to other bivalvian mitochondrial genomes, may have affected the clustering, hence the incorrect weak relationship to gastropoda, which has rather to be considered an artifact.

the diphyly of bivalvia is not a new find however , even if most recent phylogenomic studies could strongly retrieve bivalves as monophyletic  <cit> . on this aspect,  <cit>  misinterpreted our previous results  <cit> , as this is the first time we obtain bivalves as diphyletic with mitochondrial dna; this is simply because in previous works, focusing on internal relationships of the class, we invariably forced bivalves to be monophyletic  <cit> . it is remarkable that consistency with bivalves’ lower-level taxonomy was always maintained by our previous mtdna analyses, a consistency which is actually lacking in  <cit> . on the other hand, mtdna fails to retrieve strong phylogenetic signal for the most basal molluscan phylogenetic events, thus retrieving controversial results. other molecular markers are needed on the issue.

mitochondrial gene arrangement may better help in tracing basal phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . remarkably, solemya gene order connects to the katarina one by a single gene inversion event , once again pointing out that solemya belongs to a group of mollusks maintaining archaic mtdna features. the same inversion can be traced in n. nucleus: the presence of the inversion can be extrapolated by the sequenced regions and therefore can be considered very likely. this may be taken as evidence for a sister group relationship between nuculida and solemyida, thus supporting again the monophyly of opponobranchia. given the questioned status of nuculanoidea , it would be very interesting to obtain the complete mitochondrial genome of a species belonging to this superfamily and to compare it with the one of s. velum. on the other hand, gene orders of autobranchiate bivalves known so far are so highly derived and hardly connectible  to this archaic condition that the gene order of s. velum is useless in tracing phylogenetic relationships between opponobranchia and other bivalves. only the invention of a slow-evolving autobranch bivalve mtdna  would help to trace bivalvia deep phylogenetic relationships based on mtdna gene arrangements.

CONCLUSIONS
in previous paragraphs we extensively discussed many features of the mitochondrial genome of s. velum, in terms of gene/nucleotide content, strand identification, putative control region, and gene arrangement. all evidences gathered from different  sources point towards the same conclusion: s. velum retains most of the ancestral mtdna features of conchiferans, like h. rubra does within gastropods. the large similarities found with k. tunicata, an outgroup of conchiferans, on one side, and the great differences found with other known bivalves, on the other side, lead us to polarize genomic characters and conclude that the mtdna of s. velum has been probably “freezed” in a condition very similar to that of the most recent common ancestor of opponobranchia and autobranchia.

if this is true, the wide discontinuity between s. velum and autobranchia is intriguing: in facts, no mtdna representing an intermediate state is known to date, the only exceptions being some genomic features of palaeoheterodonta . in the branch leading to autobranchia, mitochondrial genome evolved on its own, like for the translocation of most – if not all – genes on a single strand; the decrease in a-t content; a possible tendency towards heavy changes in atp <dig> gene; multiple and lineage-specific events of gene rearrangement. the evolution of autobranchia seems to be tightly coupled with a dramatic increase of gene rearrangement events. which factors triggered this boost of genomic evolution, while the main cladogenetic event leading to the opponobranchia-autobranchia split was taking place in the lower cambrian  <cit> ? an exhaustive answer is probably beyond the scope of this paper, but it is tempting to investigate whether the appearance of dui played a main role in this burst  <cit> : further research on dui evolution and the characterization of mitochondrial inheritance in opponobranchia can surely shed more light on this issue. the recent discovery of dui in the nuculanid ledella ultima <cit>  is very interesting in this regard and has still to be evaluated in the light of the controversial phylogenetic position of the group.
