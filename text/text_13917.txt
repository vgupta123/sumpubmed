BACKGROUND
tolerance to cold has been a long lasting issue for maize cultivation. extension from its native tropical area in southwestern mexico toward northern countries indeed required selection of short-cycle varieties to alleviate the prolongation of growth duration by low temperature. prominent in maize history is the early flowering northern flint race that adapted to cold temperate regions of northeastern america and was introduced in northern europe probably at the beginning of the 16th century  <cit> . interestingly, in both american and european continents, northern races were hybridized with late materials to produce new types adapted to mid-latitude climates, such as corn belt dent in america resulting from the inter-crossing between northern flint and southern dent races  <cit> . after world war ii, traditional landraces were progressively replaced by hybrid varieties  <cit> . european flint inbred lines provided valuable traits for regions with cool and wet spring conditions: cold tolerance, early vigor and short growing cycles  <cit> . thanks to their good heterotic pattern with american dent material, they have been widely used in northern europe for hybrid production  <cit> .

new challenges give to cold tolerance of maize a renewed interest. the current climate change encourages early planting that potentially increases yield and participates to water deficit avoidance in summer. early harvesting is also suitable to prevent fungal growth and mycotoxin production in grain and to reduce drying costs. in france, for example, the mean sowing date has advanced from  <dig> to 15 days over the past 30 years and this trend will probably increase in the future  <cit> . however, earlier sowing dates increase the risk of exposure of the plants to cold and hence require to re-evaluate cultivated materials and to select inbreds that are more tolerant to low temperatures.

assessing cold tolerance in maize requires the choice of an experimental design. the conditions of stress occurrence, its intensity and duration as well as the developmental stage of the plants, are all critical parameters that delimit the scope of the research. on the one hand, laboratory experiments were, and still are, instrumental in identifying the physiological and cellular effects of cold. they are generally performed on young seedlings of reference genotypes, often inbred lines such as b <dig>  transferred into cold rooms  for a short period. this kind of approach clearly demonstrated that cold impairs photosynthetic machinery and unveiled the physiological mechanisms of cold tolerance  <cit> . on the other hand, field experiments explore genetic diversity within large sets of genotypes to reliably estimate the relationship between cold tolerance traits and agronomic performance. growth of maize is strongly limited below 15 °c  <cit>  and ‘chilling’ commonly refers to the temperature range between  <dig> and 15 °c  <cit> . reduced leaf growth at these temperatures implies that light interception area is limited and, in addition to impaired photosynthesis, contributes to depressed plant productivity in terms of biomass or grain yield  <cit> . numerous quantitative traits  have been identified but were only partially consistent across the different mapping populations used, indicating a strong influence of the genetic background  <cit> . moreover, assessment of chilling tolerance in the field is hampered by the fact that fluctuating environments and occurrence of multiple stresses complicate the identification of causal relationships between chilling and final yield. several authors have reported poor correlations between widely used traits, e.g., vigor of seedlings is neither positively associated with grain yield  <cit>  nor with dry matter accumulation  <cit> . selectable phenotypic traits thus remain an issue for breeding cold tolerance in maize.

european flint inbred lines are still used as a source of adaptation to cold in most maize breeding programs in northern europe  <cit>  and hence a deep understanding of their adaptation strategy could provide valuable clues for further improvement. the effects of cold on cellular processes governing leaf growth and photosynthesis can be assessed simultaneously along the maize leaf which shows a longitudinal gradient with proliferative, expanding and mature cells located at increasing distance from the base. new markers could be discovered thanks to the availability of transcriptome profiles associated with this developmental gradient  <cit>  and from homology to known regulatory networks disclosed in arabidopsis, e.g., cell cycle genes  <cit>  or cold-signalling components  <cit> . the best understood cold response pathway in plants involves cbf  transcription factors, also known as dreb <dig>  which activate target genes  <cit> . ice <dig>  is an upstream regulator of the expression of the cbf/dreb <dig> genes and is itself activated by cold at the post-translational level  <cit> .

the growth gradient of the maize leaf is established early after initiation and persists after the proliferative zone splits to occupy a region at the base of the blade and at the base of the sheath, separated by the ligule  <cit> . chilling can then restrict growth of the blade and/or the sheath of the leaves, by impairing cell proliferation and/or cell expansion, depending on their developmental stage  <cit> . in addition, when chilling occurs soon after leaf initiation, the reduction of cell division rate can be partly compensated by an increase in cell length  <cit> . cold compromises the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus in differentiating cells  <cit> , or its efficiency and integrity in mature tissues  <cit> . cold reduces the velocity of enzymatic reactions such as those catalysed, in c <dig> species like maize, by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase , or rubisco  <cit> . the resulting decrease in co <dig> assimilation leads to saturation of the electron transport  <cit> . light energy that is absorbed in excess can lead to photooxidation and damage to membrane proteins unless it is re-emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence or dissipated as heat. changes in fluorescence yield thus reflect changes in photochemical  and non-photochemical quenching  of excitation energy and are widely used as physiological proxy of cold tolerance  <cit> . heat dissipation is stimulated by the acidification of the thylakoid lumen, which activates psbs, a psii protein embedded in the thylakoid membrane, and the xanthophyll cycle, i.e., the reversible de-epoxidation of violaxanthin into dissipative zeaxanthin. in case these photoprotective mechanisms are not sufficient, psii reaction centers are subject to permanent damage, a process called photoinhibition .

the aim of this study was to characterize maize inbreds adapted to temperate climate for their tolerance to chilling. since prediction of hybrid tolerance from parental inbreds may not be reliable  <cit> , we also analysed derived flint x dent hybrids. as we expected subtle differences for cold tolerance in this material, the experiments were performed in controlled growth chambers, which provide an appropriate scale for dissecting the mechanisms of chilling tolerance in reproducible conditions  <cit> . since chilling at early stages was often studied in the literature and appeared to have few consequences on later development  <cit> , we focused on the steady-state vegetative growth of the plants. we used an array of physiological, biochemical and molecular parameters in order to gain an overview of the adaptive mechanisms that could account for cold tolerance and help to define selectable phenotypic traits.

methods
plant material and culture conditions
three unrelated flint lines  released in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and three dent lines  representing iodent/european dent, stiff stalk and lancaster heterotic groups, respectively, were provided by inra. two hybrids  were produced during the growing season 2011– <dig> in graneros  and during summer  <dig> in montardon .

grains were sown in compressed peat pots  filled with horticultural compost . when the third leaf emerged, seedlings were transplanted into larger pots  filled with the same compost supplemented with 10 % perlite . a nylon mesh was inserted in the bottom of the pot and was soaked in a reservoir to provide complete nutrient solution continuously . plants were grown in controlled cabinets  in 16-h long days, 300 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig>  or 400 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig>  of photosynthetically active radiation  being provided at the canopy level by 54-w fluorescent tubes and 40-w incandescent bulbs . air relative humidity was 70 %.

temperature treatments for inbreds and hybrids
standard temperature was 24 °c day/18 °c night. for cold treatment, plants were transferred to 10 °c day/7 °c night  or 10 °c day/4 °c night  for one week.

experimental series comprised  <dig> plants of each genotype, in control and treated  conditions. the numbers of plants and replications used for all traits measured are detailed in the table and figure legends.

growth measurements
the visible leaf stage  was defined as the total number of visible leaves counted with the plant held at eye level. for the youngest emerging leaf, the decimal stage was evaluated as in  <cit> : the ratio  between the length of the visible portion  and the total length of the leaf measured from its tip to the base of the plant  was divided by its maximum value max reached at the time the next leaf emerged. in practice, max was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the genotypes used in this study. the phyllochron is the time  between successive leaf appearance and was calculated as the inverse of mean vl increase rate.

leaf growth was estimated by leaf elongation rate and final leaf length. leaf elongation rate was estimated by measuring the elongation of the visible part of the leaf until it reached its final length. in order to avoid cumulating leaf and stem growth in leaf elongation rate calculation, length was measured from the tip of the growing leaf to the ligule of the youngest fully expanded leaf below it. end-point measurement of leaf length was made at 12-vl stage. specific leaf area  determination was made on 8-mm diameter leaf discs harvested at mid-length of leaf  <dig>  outside the mid-vein, at the end of the cold treatment.

photosynthetic parameters measurements
photosynthetic performance was evaluated by measuring the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii  and quantum efficiencies of photochemistry , of regulated thermal energy dissipation  and of constitutive thermal and radiative  energy dissipation   <cit> . the sum of the three yields  is equal to  <dig> and reflects light energy partitioning. in practice, we measured fluorescence at mid-length of leaf  <dig> emerged part after adaptation in darkness  or in the light  using a handy pea fluorimeter . the measurements were performed before , during  and after  the chilling period.

the net co <dig> assimilation rate was measured using a li- <dig> infrared gas exchange analyser . co <dig> assimilation was measured at 400 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> constant light and 380 ppm constant external co <dig> concentration, around the midpoint of leaf  <dig> blade. measurements were performed at least 4 h after light-on.

pigments and sugars analyses
8-mm leaf discs were harvested from leaf  <dig> blade, 15 cm from the ligule, on either side of the midrib. sampling was performed 5–7 h after light-on .

for pigment extraction, one leaf disc was ground in liquid nitrogen and the powder was extracted twice with 1 ml of methanol . pooled supernatants were filtered on  <dig>  μm syringe filters. 100 μl were used for high-performance liquid chromatography using a shimadzu set-up  comprising a pump , an autosampler  and a photodiode array detector . a nova pak c <dig> column  from waters  was used for separation. acquisition and data analysis were performed using the empower software . separation was obtained with the following program: 2-min gradient from 100 % solvent a  to 100 % solvent b ; 23-min gradient from 100 % b to 31 % b : 69 % c ; 10-min gradient from the latter solvent mixture to 100 % a. the solvent flow rate was 1 ml min− <dig>  all solvents were hplc grade and obtained from vwr ; commercial pigments standards from dhi-water and environment  were used for calibration. determination of geranylgeranyl-chlorophyll a peak was made according to  <cit> . total carotenoids include neoxanthin, lutein, β caroten and the  <dig> pigments of the xanthophyll cycle: violaxanthin , antheraxanthin  and zeaxanthin . a de-epoxidation index, representing the amount of zeaxanthin formed by conversion of violaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin, was calculated as /.

for sugar extraction, one leaf disc was ground in liquid nitrogen and the powder was suspended in 1 ml of 80 % ethanol: 20 % 100 mm hepes-koh , 10 mm mgcl <dig> as in  <cit> . after incubation at 80 °c for 45 min, tubes were cooled down to room temperature and centrifuged 10 min at 4 °c, 13000 g. pellet and supernatant were used for quantification of starch and soluble sugars, respectively. for starch analysis, the pellet was washed twice with 40 mm sodium acetate ph  <dig> , then resuspended in 200 μl of sterile water and autoclaved  <dig> times for 20 min at 120 °c to solubilize starch. after homogenization, quantification of starch was performed with an enzymatic kit from r-biopharm/roche  following supplier instructions. for soluble sugar analyses, the supernatant was evaporated in speedvac and the dry residue was dissolved in 1 ml of sterile water. quantification of glucose, fructose and sucrose was performed with an enzymatic kit from r-biopharm/roche . absorbance was determined at 340 nm with a lambda  <dig> uv/vis spectrophotometer .

transcriptional analyses
samples were collected from leaf  <dig> mature zone , leaf  <dig> division zone  and leaf  <dig> elongation zone . leaf tissues were harvested 5–7 h after light-on  and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. samples from 10– <dig> plants were pooled, ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until use. total rna was extracted from 100 mg of leaf tissue with 1 ml trireagent . two phenol/chloroform extractions were performed with two successive purifications with 3 m potassium acetate ph  <dig>  and 3 m sodium acetate ph  <dig> . rna was precipitated with isopropanol overnight at −20 °c. rna quantity and quality were controlled by absorption measurements at  <dig> and 260 nm . after dnase treatment of total rna  for one hour at 37 °c, first-strand cdna was synthesized from 1 μg rna, using mmlv reverse transcriptase and oligo <dig> according to the manufacturer’s instructions . aliquots were used as templates for qpcr with gene-specific primers . in each 20-μl reaction, 3 μl cdna and 10 μm of primers were used. reactions were performed in triplicate using sybr green i  in 96-well plates with an icycler iq <dig> . for normalization, a genormplus analysis was previously performed with ten housekeeping genes chosen from the literature  <cit> . five genes were selected as constitutive genes : cullin , ubiquitin , ubiquitin conjugating enzyme , folylpolyglutamate synthase  and leunig . the amplification efficiencies of all primer pairs were between  <dig> and 117 % . the relative expression software tool , which operates on cq values, includes different pcr efficiencies and uses multireference genes for normalization  <cit> , was used for the relative quantification of qpcr data.

statistical analyses
data were analysed with r software . we performed student’s t tests for results obtained from one single experiment; for replicate experiments, we pooled results when possible and performed analysis of variance in combination with means comparison  to distinguish statistically different groups . we fitted our data with linear mixed-effects models, using the lme <dig> package , to take into account the effect of independent experiments .

RESULTS
leaf growth is suspended in cold
the growth of  <dig> inbreds cultivated in phytotronic cabinets at 24 °c day/18 °c night was recorded by regular measurement of the decimal visible leaf  stage . at the 5-vl stage, one half of the plants were exposed to a chilling-treatment of one week at 10 °c day/7 °c night. we extracted from fig.  <dig> the mean phyllochron  of inbreds in control conditions, during  and after  chilling . during chilling, growth was almost arrested. among the  <dig> inbreds, the flint line f <dig>  as well as the  <dig> dent lines b <dig> and mo <dig> showed a complete stop, since the vl stage after the low temperature treatment was not different than before. by contrast, the  <dig> inbreds f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> kept on growing very slowly at 10 °c/7 °c. after return to warm conditions, growth recovered in all genotypes up to control rate level , so that the impact of the treatment finally appeared as a short delay in vl. an end-point measurement of the final length of leaf  <dig> was performed at the 12-vl stage: in all genotypes, leaf  <dig> blade was 55-cm to 70-cm long in control conditions and was 10 % to 18 % shorter in plants that had been chilled for one week . this negative effect of cold on leaf length was not visible on shoot biomass measured à 12-vl stage .fig.  <dig> effect of chilling on leaf appearance rate in  <dig> inbred lines of maize. the 7-day chilling treatment  was applied at the 5-vl stage . decimal leaf stage was measured on  <dig> plants per genotype; results shown are means ± sd. open symbols show plants grown in control conditions; filled symbols show chilled plants. upper line: flint inbreds; lower line: dent inbreds. * indicates significant growth during chilling

the f <dig> and f <dig> contrasted flint lines were chosen for further analyses in hybrid context. the f <dig> dent line was chosen as the male tester, as it originates mainly from iodent germplasm, a group well known for its good combining ability with flint material  <cit> . since we expected a higher number of leaves in hybrids as compared with the flint parents and an heterotic effect on plant tolerance to low temperatures, chilling was applied at a later stage  and in harder conditions  than in the inbred experiments. we observed that the rate of leaf emergence was similar in the hybrids than in the inbreds in control conditions, and that chilling caused a strong inhibition of growth . plants of hybrid f03802xf <dig> completely stopped growing during the treatment whereas f2xf <dig> continued very slowly. phyllochron rose to normal values upon return to warm conditions. thus, the hybrids behaved as their flint parental line f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> effect of chilling on leaf growth in two maize hybrids. the 7-day chilling treatment  was applied at about the 6-vl stage . a leaf appearance rate. decimal leaf stage was measured on 15– <dig> plants per genotype in each treatment; results shown are means ± sd for  <dig> experiments. * indicates significant growth during chilling period . b leaf elongation rate of leaves  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  data are means ± sd of  <dig> plants for one experiment. c final length of leaves  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  data are means ± sd of 90– <dig> plants . * indicates significant effect of chilling . d leaf length deficit in chilling-treated plants, as % of controls




in the experiments reported above, the effect of cold was evaluated on the emergence of leaves, which occurs during their linear phase of elongation. this was confirmed by elongation rate measurements in the hybrid experiment performed at 6-vl stage . during cold treatment, elongation of leaf  <dig> immediately ceased in hybrid f03802xf <dig> but persisted at a very low rate in f2xf <dig>  for about 4 days. in both hybrids, the elongation rate returned to its initial value upon return to warm temperature, but for a shorter time than the duration from appearance to the end of linear phase in control conditions. consequently, the size of leaf  <dig> was significantly lower in cold-treated plants . the blade was relatively more affected than the sheath . the same measurements were performed on leaf  <dig>  which was at the end of the linear phase of elongation at the start of the cold treatment, and on leaf  <dig> which had already entered the decelerating phase of leaf growth, i.e., had reached its final blade length. cold caused a severe reduction of elongation in the two leaves but, again, f2xf <dig> kept on growing very slowly during the first days at low temperature whereas elongation completely stopped in f03802xf <dig>  by contrast, recovery was better in the latter hybrid. finally, leaf  <dig> was significantly shorter in cold-treated plants and the blade and sheath lengths were equally reduced by about 10 % . only the sheath of leaf  <dig> was reduced after cold, but there was no consequential and significant impact on total leaf length. these effects of cold on leaf length were altogether insufficient to cause a significant reduction in shoot biomass measured at 10-vl .

chilling effects on the photosynthetic machinery
we measured the maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry , which is a good indicator of psii integrity  <cit>  and the quantum yield of electron transport in the light  at  <dig>  or  <dig>  μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> par. the use of excitation energy unaccounted for by Φpsii was estimated as in  <cit>  by Φnpq, which is the fraction of light that is dissipated thermally via regulated processes and by Φf,d, which is the fraction of light that is lost by fluorescence  or constitutive thermal dissipation .

no significant difference was found between the three parental inbreds for fv/fm measurements in control conditions but more variability was found for Φpsii, f <dig> being the least efficient inbred . chilling induced a severe reduction of fv/fm from the first day for the two flint inbreds whereas f <dig> was significantly affected after one week of stress only. for the three inbreds, Φpsii was negatively impacted by chilling from the onset, reflecting severe reduction of photochemical processes. amazingly, dissipation of the excess light energy did not occur by regulated heat emission but by fluorescence or constitutive heat emission in the flint inbreds f <dig> and f <dig>  as indicated by the decrease in Φnpq and the increase in Φf,d during chilling. the situation was different in the dent inbred f <dig> where an increase in Φnpq, and hence in regulated thermal dissipation, was observed at the beginning of the chilling period and followed by an increase in Φf,d after 7 days of stress, when fv/fm was lower. it is then noteworthy that variations in Φf,d and fv/fm occurred in opposite patterns in all three inbreds. seven days after the end of chilling , all parameters had recovered to control levels for all inbreds, indicating that the damages caused by the treatment on the integrity and functioning of photosystems were reversible. for dent inbred f <dig>  Φpsii of treated plant was even higher after chilling than that of control plants. this observation suggests a compensatory activation of photosynthesis after cold but might also be explained by a decline of photosynthesis efficiency in control conditions possibly due to faster leaf senescence.fig.  <dig> effect of chilling on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in  <dig> inbred lines of maize. the 7-day chilling treatment  was applied at about the 5-vl stage . from the top to the bottom: maximal quantum yield of psii ; quantum yield of psii in the light ; regulated thermal energy dissipation ; constitutive thermal and radiative  energy dissipation . measurements were performed in the middle of 4th leaf blade before , during  and after  the chilling treatment. data are means ± sd of  <dig> plants for one experiment. * indicates significant effect of chilling 




the same analysis was performed with the two hybrids f2xf <dig> and f03802xf <dig>  as observed with the parents, low temperature had a negative effect on fv/fm and Φpsii . interestingly though, the impact on fv/fm was significant after 3 days of chiling only, i.e., later than what was observed for the flint parents f <dig> and f <dig> , suggesting a benefit from the f <dig> dent parent. by contrast, Φpsii had already decreased after 1 day of chilling, indicating a reduction in electron transport, and continued to do so until the end of the treatment. most interestingly, dissipation of the excess energy occurred by regulated and non-regulated  processes since both Φnpq and Φf,d increased during the chilling treatment. this result indicates that the hybrids combined the dissipation strategies of their flint and dent parents shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> effect of chilling on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in two maize hybrids. the 7-day chilling treatment  was applied at about the 6-vl stage . from top to bottom: maximal quantum yield of psii ; quantum yield of psii in the light ; regulated thermal energy dissipation ; constitutive thermal and radiative  energy dissipation . measurements were performed in the middle of 4th leaf blade before , during  and after  the chilling treatment. data are means ± sd of  <dig> plants . * indicates significant effect of chilling 




chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of leaf  <dig> were compared in treated and control plants . tissues were harvested at the end of the chilling period for the treated plants, or 1 day after the beginning of the treatment for the control plants to compare plants at the same vl stage. in control conditions, f03802xf <dig> contained more chlorophyll  per unit leaf area than f2xf <dig>  chilling caused a strong decrease in chlorophyll content in both hybrids, but the chlorophyll a/b ratio showed little variation. by contrast, there was a noticeable accumulation of the precursor geranylgeranyl chlorophyll a, indicating a reduction in chlorophyll a biosynthesis; this effect was stronger in f2xf <dig> than in f03802xf <dig>  the carotenoid content of the leaf was not very different in chilling versus standard conditions but whereas the xanthophyll pool was almost fully epoxidized in control conditions, the de-epoxidation index  increased to about 20 % in the cold, indicating the activation of the xanthophyll cycle. the index was slightly higher in f03802xf <dig> than in f2xf <dig> table  <dig> effect of chilling treatment on leaf pigment content in two maize hybrids

effects of low temperature on gene expression
in order to see whether the effects of cold on leaf elongation and photosynthesis could be correlated with changes in gene expression, a panel of candidate genes was selected from the literature and analysed by rt-qpcr. two samples were taken in the growing zone of leaf 5: one in the meristematic zone and one in the elongation zone . for photosynthetic metabolism, leaf discs were harvested in the blade of leaf  <dig> where the fv/fm, Φpsii, co <dig> assimilation, pigments and sugar analyses had been performed. in all zones, the transcript levels of dreb <dig> and ice <dig> homologs were quantified as markers of cold signalling  <cit>  and five different constitutive genes were used for relative rt-qpcr quantifications. we found that zmdreb <dig> was induced at the end of the chilling treatment in the cell division and cell elongation zones of leaf  <dig>  whereas the transcript levels of ice <dig> were similar than in untreated leaves . the up-regulation of zmdreb <dig> was two times higher in f03802xf <dig> than in f2xf <dig>  interestingly, the opposite was observed in the mature zone of leaf  <dig>  where ice <dig> was strongly induced in low temperature conditions but not zmdreb <dig>  these results suggest that chilling signalling is different in growing non-photosynthetic tissues and in photosynthetic cells.fig.  <dig> effect of chilling on gene expression in the leaves of two maize hybrids. the 7-day chilling treatment  was applied at about the 6-vl stage. analyses were performed at the end of the chilling treatment for treated plants or 1 day after the beginning of the treatment for control plants in order to compare plants at the same developmental stage. a sampling procedure. b relative expression levels quantified by rt-qpcr. five genes were used for normalization. data are means ± se of  <dig> technical replicates for one experiment; two replicate experiments are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  gene abbreviations: ice <dig> , dreb <dig> , cdka <dig> , cyca <dig> , krp <dig> , expa <dig> , expb <dig> , ggr , cab <dig> , psbs , vde , pepc , ppdk  and rbcs 




the transcripts of three cell-cycle genes were quantified in the proliferation zone of leaf 5: cdka <dig> , cyca <dig>  and krp <dig>  were chosen after rymen et al.  <cit>  showed that these genes were differentially expressed in the meristematic zone of leaves exposed to cold nights. this was obviously not the case in our experimental design since the relative transcript levels of the three genes were hardly different in chilled and control leaves. in the elongation zone, two expansin genes, expa <dig> and expb <dig>  selected from  <cit>  were up-regulated in the cold. in the mature zone of leaf  <dig>  the list of candidates genes included cab <dig>  encoding a chlorophyll a/b binding protein of psii  <cit> , psbs and violaxanthin de-epoxidase  both involved in energy dissipation  , the gene encoding geranylgeranyl reductase  that catalyses the terminal hydrogenation of geranylgeranyl chlorophyll a to form chlorophyll a  <cit>  and genes encoding c4- and calvin-cycle enzymes: pepc, ppdk and the small subunit of rubisco . results were fully consistent for both hybrids: we observed a strong downregulation of cab <dig> and ggr in the chilling conditions, but no change in the relative transcript level of psbs and vde. the genes encoding enzymes of the c <dig> metabolism were all downregulated in the cold.

discussion
the aim of this study was to analyse the mechanisms of cold tolerance in european maize in order to identify appropriate ways towards further improvement. although the genetic panel was small, two levels of response to chilling were observed : either a complete stop in vegetative growth during the chilling treatment  as observed in one flint inbred  and two dents , or a very slow continuation of growth, recorded in two flint lines  and one dent . cessation of growth was consistent with the fact that 10 °c is basal temperature for maize  <cit> . interestingly, the habit of the flint parent was transmitted in the flint x dent hybrid, as observed after the f03802xf <dig> and f2xf <dig> crosses . the analyses were thereafter continued on the hybrids.

cessation of growth was measured as of lag in leaf appearance and hence could be due to cessation of cell proliferation or expansion in the emerging leaf. rymen et al.  <cit>  observed that cold nights  reduced maize leaf growth through a prolonged cell cycle in the meristematic zone and correlated this with changes in the expression level of cell cycle genes. using three of their markers, we did not observe any change in transcript level in our experimental conditions , which differed from rymen’s in the temperature regime and the developmental stage of the leaf. louarn et al.  <cit>  indeed found that chilling impairs cell proliferation during the exponential phase of leaf growth  and cell elongation during the late linear phase of growth. the reduction of cell elongation is likely to be responsible for the 8-fold reduction in elongation rate observed in our study. it is then all the more surprising that we detected an increased level of transcripts for two expansin genes in the leaves that were exposed to low temperatures. while expansins have primarily a growth promoting function, they seem important for counteracting growth-repressing activities  <cit> . moreover, up-regulation of expansin genes was described in arabidopsis leaves exposed to a mild drought stress, opposite to their down-regulation in severe drought, and was interpreted as a ‘get ready for growth’ state  <cit> . such a hypothesis would perfectly fit chilling tolerance in the maize hybrids since we observed a very fast resumption of growth upon return of the plants to warm temperatures .

a reduction in temperature slows down most physiological processes, explaining the arrest of growth. decreased sink activity in turn can alter carbohydrate allocation and if assimilation of co <dig> continued in the photosynthetic tissues, carbohydrates would accumulate. this scenario was observed in both hybrids, in which chilling caused a reduction in co <dig> assimilation but a sharp increase in sugar content and consequently a decrease in sla . interestingly, these changes were of higher amplitude in the f03802xf <dig> hybrid, which completely ceased growing during chilling, than in f2xf <dig>  indicating a correlation with growth rate. similar phenotypic differentiation was found between european flint and european dent breeding groups by gwas  <cit> . in this study, the authors reported that the specific response of european flint lines to chilling temperatures was a strong reduction in sla, i.e., a rather xeromorphic growth habit resulting from the reduction in leaf area with only little reduction in leaf dry weight, and suggested that this might be a way to reduce transpiration. by contrast, the specific adaptation of european dent to chilling stress appeared to be the maintenance of growth despite reduced photosynthetic capacity, suggesting a highly efficient carbon fixation. these two strategies appeared in our study as differentiating the f03802xf <dig> and f2xf <dig> hybrids, although their distinct parents were from the same european flint breeding group. a possibility could be that the dent traits were differentially expressed in the two hybrids but the phenotypic differentiation in terms of growth cessation or continuation was observed in the parental f <dig> and f <dig> lines, indicating differentiation within the european flint breeding group.

the decrease in co <dig> assimilation in maize plants grown at low temperatures is abundantly documented  <cit> . it is at least partly a primary effect of low temperatures limiting chemical reaction rates catalysed by c4- and calvin-cycle enzymes  <cit> . however, we detected a reduction in the relative abundance of transcripts encoding three major proteins: pepc, ppdk and rbcs , indicating that photosynthetic genes were downstream targets of cold signalling, either direct or indirect by negative feedback from accumulating sugars . surprisingly, cold signalling in the mature leaf of the two hybrids where these changes were analysed did not follow the canonical pathway described in arabidopsis where ice <dig> is constitutively expressed and activation of the ice <dig> protein by cold is responsible for up-regulation of dreb <dig> gene  <cit> . on the opposite, we observed up-regulation of ice <dig> but not of zmdreb <dig> in the mature leaf exposed to chilling whereas the reverse pattern was observed in proliferation and elongation zones of younger leaf . hu et al.  <cit>  showed that cold triggered chromatin modifications at the ice <dig> binding region of zmdreb <dig> promoter in maize seedlings, where both zmdreb <dig> and ice <dig> are strongly induced. further experiments are required to understand the developmental changes in cold-signalling pathway in maize leaves.

the rate of consumption of nadph and atp are major factors that determine psii operating efficiency and hence the decrease in co <dig> assimilation could account for the decreased psii operating efficiency  detected in chilling conditions. we indeed observed a reduction in Φpsii before any symptom of photoinhibition, such as a decrease in fv/fm . when the rate of photosynthesis is reduced by chilling, excess excitation energy has to be dissipated either by constitutive or light-activated processes   <cit> . surprisingly, we observed that the flint inbreds f <dig> and f <dig> mostly dissipated the energy by constitutive processes  whereas the dent f <dig> activated heat dissipative npq processes. even more interesting, the flint x dent hybrids appeared to use both parental strategies, but to moderate levels. we did not observe a strong enhancement of Φnpq during chilling treatment of the two hybrids ; the size of the xanthophyll pool did not increase and even if the de-epoxidation index rose to about 20 % , this level remained much lower than what can be found in the literature . we did not detect any effect of chilling on the relative abundance of transcripts encoding the psbs or vde proteins that are involved in regulated heat dissipation . although we can not dismiss post-translational regulation of these proteins  <cit> , the weak variations in Φnpq and Φf,d suggest that the photosynthetic machinery of the hybrids was not much impacted by the chilling treatment.

severe chilling stress leads to destruction of the psii reaction center protein d <dig> and a decrease in chlorophyll a/b ratio was seen as a sign of the progressive imbalance between antennas and reaction center integrity  <cit> . again, we did not observe this symptom and hence the decrease in fv/fm that we measured would be an indicator of psii inactivation rather than photoinhibition per se. interestingly, we observed that chilling compromised expression of cab <dig> gene , encoding one of the major proteins of psii antennas, as well as chlorophyll biosynthesis . these can be seen as adaptation mechanisms to reduce antennas size and light absorption.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our study suggests that the photosynthetic machinery of european maize is pretty well adapted to short chilling spells and hence that further improvements may not originate from this avenue. by contrast, the growth habit might have been underestimated so far since, from a breeding point of view, strategies to achieve greater biomass at low temperatures require sustained growth at low temperature  <cit> . this rationale might be reversed if refraining growth during chilling maintained the plants in a ‘ready to grow’ state to ensure fast recovery once better temperatures are restored. new adaptation traits could then be selected for areas with short cold events by considering the ability of the mechanisms regulating cell proliferation and cell expansion in the growing zones of the leaves to maintain a standby mode during the stress.
