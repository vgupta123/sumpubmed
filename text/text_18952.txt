BACKGROUND
plastid genome sequence information is of central importance to several fields of plant biology, including phylogenetics, molecular biology and evolution, and plastid genetic engineering  <cit> . the relatively small size of the plastid genome  has made its complete sequencing technically feasible since the mid-1980s, although limitations in sequencing technology resulted in only a few complete plastid genomes appearing between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . however, the pace of plastid genome sequencing has increased markedly over the last five years  <cit> . more than  <dig> complete plastid genomes are now available on genbank, and several plastid genome sequencing projects  <cit>  promise to increase that number to more than  <dig> in the near future. this dramatic growth in plastid genome sequencing has been driven largely by improvements in sanger sequencing technology that have greatly reduced the time and cost involved in genome sequencing  <cit> .

new approaches to genome sequencing have been proposed in recent years that, if effective, will further significantly reduce the time and cost of obtaining whole plastid genome sequences  <cit> . perhaps the most promising of these new technologies involves the genome sequencer  <dig>  system, a pyrosequencing platform developed by the  <dig> life sciences corporation . in pyrosequencing, the dna sequence is determined by analyzing flashes of light that are released during the enzymatic conversion of pyrophosphate generated during template dna extension, using a predetermined sequence of dntp addition  <cit> . the gs  <dig> system implements several novel technologies that allow for relatively rapid and inexpensive pyrosequencing on a massive scale  <cit> . these include an emulsion-based method to amplify random fragment libraries of template dna in bulk, fiber-optic slides containing high-density, picoliter-sized pyrosequencing reactors, and a three-bead system to deliver the enzymes necessary for the pyrosequencing reactions. in a single run the gs  <dig> system generates up to  <dig> million high-quality bases in hundreds of thousands of short sequence reads called flowgrams, which are then assembled into genomic contigs. for relatively small genomes, the high number of reads results in a high average depth of sequence coverage, effectively overcoming many of the limitations of pyrosequencing, which include relatively short read length and uncertainty in the length of homopolymer runs  <cit> . perhaps the greatest advantage of the gs  <dig> system is that it generates genome sequence much more rapidly and economically than traditional sanger-based shotgun sequencing. it is not necessary to clone template dna into bacterial vectors, and genome sequence can be obtained on the gs  <dig> in a single five-hour run with a few days of template preparation. likewise, the gs  <dig> system relies on less expensive reagents than traditional sanger sequencing. however, the savings in time and money associated with gs  <dig> de novo genome sequence comes at the cost of a slightly higher error rate compared to traditional sanger-based genome sequence   <cit> .

to date the gs  <dig> system has been successfully utilized in an increasing number of de novo sequencing projects, including sequencing the genomes of several bacteria and the mitochondrial genome of an extinct species of mammoth, as well as exploring the sequence diversity present in environmental samples  <cit> . because of its small size and similarity to bacterial genomes, the plastid genome seems particularly amenable to sequencing via the gs  <dig> system. in conjunction with the angiosperm tree of life  project  <cit> , part of which involves sequencing  <dig> plastid genomes representing the phylogenetic diversity of angiosperms, we used the gs  <dig> to sequence the complete plastid genomes of the eudicot angiosperms nandina domestica thunb.  and platanus occidentalis l. . a major focus of the atol plastid genome sequencing project is the use of whole-chloroplast genome sequence data to determine the evolutionary relationships among the basal lineages of eudicots, which have hitherto proved difficult to resolve  <cit> . we therefore sequenced nandina and platanus because they represent members of two phylogenetically pivotal basal lineages of eudicots , which shared their last common ancestor approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in sequencing these two plastid genomes using the gs  <dig> system we had the following specific objectives:  to test the overall feasibility of generating plastid genome sequence using the gs  <dig> system,  to determine the potential error rate in gs  <dig> de novo plastid genome sequence, and  to determine whether the magnitude of the gs  <dig> error rate is enough to offset any potential gains in time and cost efficiency associated with the use of the gs  <dig>  here we demonstrate the viability of the gs  <dig> system for plastid genome sequencing projects by generating highly accurate and essentially complete plastid genome sequences of both nandina and platanus, for a significant reduction in time and cost over traditional sanger-based plastid genome sequencing.

RESULTS
gs  <dig> sequencing run characteristics
results of the gs  <dig> sequencing runs for nandina and platanus are summarized in table  <dig>  more than  <dig> % coverage of each genome was obtained by assembling the raw sequence data from the titration and supplemental sequencing runs , to an overall average depth of coverage of  <dig> × in nandina and  <dig> × in platanus. few gaps were present in either genome assembly . all but three gaps were less than  <dig> bp, with many zero-length gaps  present in both assemblies. only one gap in either assembly was larger than  <dig> bp . in several cases gaps in the assemblies occurred in the same regions of both genomes. short gaps  were present at all four junctions between the inverted repeat  and single-copy  regions in both nandina and platanus, as well as within the rpob gene  of each genome.

genome characteristics
the plastid genomes of both nandina and platanus possess the typical genome structure observed in most angiosperm plastids, with an ir region of ~ <dig> kb separating large and small sc regions   <cit> . neither genome is rearranged relative to nicotiana  <cit> . the plastid genomes of nandina and platanus share essentially identical complements of coding genes, each containing  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> rrna genes, and  <dig> protein-coding genes . based on the presence of internal stop codons, two pseudogenes  are present in the platanus plastid genome. in nandina the latter locus is also present as a pseudogene, although ycf <dig> appears intact. both of these genes have been frequently reported as pseudogenes in other angiosperms  <cit> , and so their presence as pseudogenes in nandina and platanus is not surprising. based on the presence of acg start codons in their dna sequence, rna editing appears to be necessary for the proper translation of two genes in nandina  and three genes in platanus , and likely occurs throughout each genome on a broader scale  <cit> .

accuracy of the gs  <dig> sequence
conventional sequencing of the ir, ir/sc junctions, and regions surrounding putative coding sequence errors resulted in  <dig> bp of comparison sequence in nandina and  <dig> bp of comparison sequence in platanus. observed error rates in the combined run data for these regions are summarized in table  <dig>  observed numbers of errors in combined run data and lengths of conventional sequence data that were used in the error calculations are presented in table  <dig>  the overall observed error rate was  <dig> % in nandina and  <dig> % in platanus, and the combined overall error rate for both genomes was  <dig> % .

two types of errors were observed in the gs  <dig> combined data sequence: errors associated with contig ends, and insertions and deletions , usually associated with homopolymer runs. a small number of errors was present within  <dig> bp of the ends of the combined data contigs in both genomes . including these errors increased overall error rates to  <dig> % in nandina and  <dig> % in platanus. however, these errors were excluded from other error calculations because they were expected as a result of the low depth of coverage at contig ends, and because such errors were necessarily checked by targeted sanger sequencing when bridging the gaps between contigs, unlike the remaining, higher-coverage regions of the gs  <dig> assembly. all remaining errors were indels, all but one of which  were directly associated with homopolymer runs . all hr-associated indel errors fell into two overall classes . approximately 85% of all errors associated with hrs involved length variation in the number of bases in a given hr. the remaining hr-associated errors involved the insertion of a base identical in composition with a given hr to a nearby, nonadjacent position. because these insertions appear similar to transpositions, they are referred to as transposition-like insertions. an illustration of a transposition-like insertion is provided in figure 3a.

substitution errors were not definitively observed in either genome, although two differences in base composition between the conventional and gs  <dig> sequence were observed in the ir of nandina. however, because the conventional ir sequence for nandina was derived from a separate individual than that used in the gs  <dig> sequencing, it is likely that both differences result from interindividual variation, especially given that both sites possessed high-quality phred scores  in the gs  <dig> sequence. these two putative substitutions were therefore not included in error calculations.

characteristics of the homopolymer runs associated with observed and estimated errors are also summarized in table  <dig>  more than 95% of all error-associated hrs in both genomes were a/t runs rather than c/g runs. a χ <dig> test indicated that this a/t hr-associated error bias was significantly higher than would be expected given the observed a/t content of both genomes . approximately half of all errors occurred in regions characterized by groups of hrs of identical base composition interrupted occasionally by a differing base . the length distribution of hrs associated with the observed errors is shown in figure  <dig>  approximately 60% of all errors were associated with runs of  <dig> nucleotides or greater in both genomes. of those errors associated with runs less than  <dig> nucleotides, all were associated with homopolymer run sets in platanus, as were  <dig> of  <dig> such errors in nandina. all  <dig> of the hr set-associated errors in nandina occurred in a single 100-bp extensive hr set within the trnv/rps <dig> spacer in the inverted repeat. hr-associated insertion errors occurred more frequently than deletion errors in both genomes .

nearly all insertion errors in both genomes occurred at sites with low or very low gs  <dig> quality scores . approximately 81% of all insertion errors had gs  <dig> phred-equivalent quality scores <  <dig>  and approximately 93% of insertion errors had quality scores ≤  <dig>  however, one insertion error in each genome occurred at a site with a quality score >  <dig> .

errors were not distributed uniformly throughout either plastid genome . the combined error rate across both genomes was higher in the sc regions than in the ir regions . regions of putative noncoding sequence also exhibited a higher error rate  than regions of putative coding sequence across both genomes . similarly, error rates for noncoding sequence partitioned into ir and sc regions were higher than for coding sequence when pooled across both genomes . the lowest overall error rates for both genomes were observed in the ir coding regions while the highest overall error rates were observed in the ir and sc noncoding regions. in both genomes at least one relatively small region contained a disproportionately large percentage of the total errors. a region of approximately  <dig> bp in the trnv/rps <dig> spacer of the nandina genome contained  <dig> errors  in association with an extensive homopolymer run set. likewise, three errors were observed in the ycf <dig> gene in both genomes , and three errors were also present in rpob of platanus.

discussion
using the gs  <dig> system, we generated highly accurate and essentially complete plastid genome sequences simultaneously for two angiosperms in a short period of time  and for a significant reduction in cost  over traditional shotgun-based genome sequencing methods. this savings in time and cost derives largely from the relative ease of template preparation and the extremely high throughput of the gs  <dig> system, which avoids the use of bacterial vectors and multiple rounds of expensive dye terminator-based sequencing reactions, both of which are necessary and time-consuming  components of sanger-based shotgun sequencing  <cit> . we estimate that the gs  <dig> system requires approximately half the amount of template preparation time  compared to traditional sanger-based methods  for plastid genome sequencing. moreover, plastid genome sequencing using the gs  <dig> can be accomplished with two 4-hour instrument runs, while obtaining plastid genomes with sanger-based shotgun sequencing requires several capillary sequencer runs  per genome. the small size of the plastid genome further contributes to the savings accompanying the gs  <dig> by allowing for multiple genomes to be sequenced simultaneously. the recent release of larger gs  <dig> picotiterplates with the capacity to sequence up to four plastid genomes at a time promises to drive down the cost of gs  <dig> plastid genome sequencing even more, to ~$ <dig> per genome.

it is important to note that the savings observed in gs  <dig> sequencing of nandina and platanus also resulted from the lower average coverage obtained for these two chloroplast genomes  compared to that reported by margulies et al.  <cit>  for de novo genome sequencing . a similar reduction in coverage using sanger-based sequencing methods would also result in a significant cost savings, perhaps still with a slightly higher sequence accuracy compared to the gs  <dig> genome sequence. however, to take full advantage of the ability to reduce coverage in sanger-based plastid genome sequencing would require the sequencing of pure plastid dna, something that can only reliably be achieved at present by constructing whole-genome bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and then strictly sequencing plastid dna-containing clones. the method of isolating plastid dna using sucrose-gradient based chloroplast isolation and rca  that is employed in most angiosperm plastid genome sequencing projects is significantly less expensive than the construction of bac libraries, although approximately 10–40% of the resulting rca product consists of non-plastid dna  <cit> . this contamination penalty must be overcome in sanger-based sequencing through the addition of extra sequencing capacity, thereby partially mitigating against the significant savings that could be accrued through reducing sequence coverage. the same contaminants also reduce overall plastid genome coverage in gs  <dig> sequencing runs, but this does not impede the recovery of essentially complete plastid genomes at high accuracy, as evidenced by the sequencing of the nandina and platanus genomes. thus the gs  <dig> instrument seems a reasonable and cost-effective alternative to sanger-based shotgun sequencing with respect to angiosperm plastid genomics.

the generation of gs  <dig> genome sequence comes at the price of a slightly higher error rate  in comparison to sanger sequencing   <cit> . nevertheless, the small magnitude of this error is not enough to offset the potential gains in time and cost efficiency of the gs  <dig> system. it is possible that the addition of extra gs  <dig> sequencing lanes on the picotiterplates could reduce error rates below that observed in nandina and platanus, particularly in regions of relatively lower coverage. however, adding more lanes for each genome would drive up the cost of sequencing by reducing the number of plastid genomes that could be sequenced per plate . depending on the aims and fiscal resources of a given sequencing project, the extra cost imparted by additional picotiterplate space may not outweigh the benefits of slightly lower error rates.

the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the observed error in the gs  <dig> genome sequence of nandina and platanus are similar to those reported in published gs  <dig> sequence data. although the error rates in margulies et al.  <cit>  for de novo genome sequencing represent estimates derived from consensus quality scores rather than observed error rates derived from comparison to sanger sequence, the overall error rate reported for bacterial genomes in  <cit>   was similar to that observed in both plastid genomes . importantly, we achieved comparable error rates to margulies et al.  <cit>  at approximately half the coverage in  <cit> . this equivalent error rate of ~ <dig> % at lower coverage is the result of recent improvements in the gs  <dig> assembly software ; assembling the nandina and platanus genomes using the older software resulted in much higher error rates for both genomes . it is also interesting to note that the lower average coverage of platanus, which resulted directly from the higher percentage of non-cpdna contamination in the rca product of platanus  vs. that of nandina , did not result in a higher error rate compared to nandina .

the high percentage of errors associated with hrs and hr sets in nandina and platanus is similar to that reported in previously published gs  <dig> genome sequence  <cit>  and is unsurprising given the known limitations of pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . the relatively high percentage of errors associated with these long hrs or hr sets also imparted some of the nonuniformity observed in the distributions of errors in both genomes. likewise, the higher frequency of such long homopolymer runs or sets in noncoding plastid regions  <cit>  explains the higher observed error rates in noncoding regions of both genomes . finally, the a/t bias present in both genomes  does not appear to be solely responsible for the high proportion of a/t-associated hr errors . whether this excess of a/t hr errors is a byproduct of the gs  <dig> pyrosequencing technology is difficult to determine without more extensive analyses of additional genome sequences.

another primary factor influencing the nonrandom distribution of errors in both genomes was relative depth of coverage in a particular region. the lower error rates observed in the ir regions of platanus probably resulted in part from the essentially double coverage of the ir vs. sc regions during gs  <dig> sequencing . it is also likely that the higher error rate observed in some areas of both plastid genomes, as for example in ycf <dig> and rpob, resulted from lower gs  <dig> sequence coverage in these regions. the ultimate cause of this lower coverage is unknown, but a plausible explanation involves the relative underamplification of these regions during the rca reactions  <cit> .

as we have demonstrated, the presence of a small amount of error in gs  <dig> genome sequence is not a serious impediment to the future use of the gs  <dig> system. because nearly all errors in gs  <dig> sequence involve hr-associated length variation, the few errors that occur in protein-coding sequence can be easily identified because they induce frameshifts. such errors can then be corrected through conventional sequencing. the gs  <dig> system should therefore prove to be an extremely useful tool in generating sequence for plastid coding regions, with only minimal finishing required to achieve essentially 100% accuracy. the gs 20-derived noncoding sequence will also be highly accurate, although a small number of errors will remain in the unchecked noncoding regions. however, the great majority of these errors will be associated with long homopolymer runs or homopolymer run sets, which are regions that are known to evolve rapidly via length mutations  <cit> . moreover, long homopolymer runs are also prone to pcr errors  <cit> , and therefore even conventional sequencing cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in such regions. for these reasons short length variation in such areas is frequently removed from phylogenetic sequence alignments, and the few remaining unchecked errors in gs  <dig> sequence are therefore unlikely to cause major problems should they be included in phylogenetic analyses.

the gs  <dig> system thus appears to be a viable option for plastid genome sequencing projects, especially given that the strong conservation of gene content and order exhibited by the nandina and platanus plastid genomes is shared across the overwhelming majority of angiosperms  <cit> . perhaps the only significant limitation to the current use of the gs  <dig> in angiosperm plastid genome sequencing is posed by highly rearranged plastid genomes. such genomes are characterized by high numbers of repeats  <cit> , which could drive misassemblies during gs  <dig> sequence analysis due to short gs  <dig> read lengths. however, because very few lineages of angiosperms contain highly rearranged plastid genomes   <cit> , the gs  <dig> should prove widely applicable to most angiosperms, as well as land plants in general.

CONCLUSIONS
the utility of the gs  <dig> has already been demonstrated in bacterial, mitochondrial, and environmental de novo sequencing projects  <cit> , and it shows promise for a number of other high-throughput sequencing projects, including transcriptome sequencing and snp discovery. here we have successfully applied gs  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to sequence the entire plastid genomes of two distantly related angiosperms with a significant savings of time and cost over traditional shotgun-based sequencing methods. this savings was partially achieved by sequencing to a lower average coverage than that reported in other gs  <dig> de novo genome sequencing projects. nevertheless, this ~20× level of coverage was sufficient for the near complete recovery of both plastid genomes with ~ <dig> % accuracy. the gs  <dig> system may well usher in a new era of rapid and inexpensive plastid genome sequencing, thereby revolutionizing the fields of plant genetics and phylogenetics by dramatically expanding the amount of sequence data available to both.
