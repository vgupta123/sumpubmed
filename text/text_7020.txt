BACKGROUND
in higher eucaryotes dna replication progresses in a defined spatio-temporal pattern. specific segments of the dna/chromatin replicate as discrete regions, which when visualized by light microscopy, are called replication foci . it is suggested that each replication focus is constituted of a subchromosomal domain of adjacent replicons from the same chromosomal region that replicate together in time and space and their associated protein machines . these subchromosomal domains are maintained as single units through multiple rounds of cell division, and they occupy stable positions in the nucleus  <cit> . the existence of various patterns of rf has been demonstrated in living mammalian cells by labeling the rf with fluorescent proteins fused to core replication factors, like dna ligase i or pcna  <cit> . such studies have shown that replication proteins continuously assemble at many subchromosomal domains to form rf, and continuously disassemble from sites that have completed replication   <cit> , dna polymerase alpha  <cit> , dna ligase i  <cit> , rpa <dig> and cell cycle regulators cyclin a and cdk <dig>  <cit> , and dna repair factors like uracil-dna-glycosylase  <cit> . such replication factors undergo dynamic re-distribution in the nucleus during s phase. in the g <dig> phase, most replication proteins are homogeneously distributed in the nucleoplasm. upon entry into s phase, replication proteins form punctate patterns that co-localize with sites of active dna synthesis. this accumulation at rf is mediated by specific peptide sequences in the replication proteins called replication foci targeting sequence . a known mechanism of recruitment of replication factors to rf is through the interaction with pcna, via a short amino acid motif termed pcna binding domain . this has been observed to be a recurrent mechanism utilized by many replication factors. over the years many proteins involved in dna metabolism and cell cycle regulation have been shown to interact with pcna via the canonical pbd found in dnmt <dig>  <cit>  and dna ligase i  <cit> . the pbd is conserved in homologous proteins from archaebacteria, yeast, worms, flies, amphibians and mammals  <cit> . such conservation across different classes of organisms suggests that the recruitment of proteins to rf mediated by pbd-pcna interaction is a mechanism conserved throughout evolution. indeed, many features of dna replication are conserved in higher eucaryotes. firstly, general features of the replication process itself, like bi-directional replication fork movement, continuous leading and discontinuous lagging strand synthesis, requirement of rna primers to start dna synthesis are all conserved  <cit> . secondly, the proteins involved in controlling dna replication and catalyzing the process of dna replication are conserved in diverse eucaryotes  <cit> . thirdly, organization of replication into rf that follow a spatio-temporal pattern is a conserved feature in diverse eucaryotes that have been analyzed  <cit> . other than the conservation of the pbd in homologous proteins, however, there is no experimental evidence whether the mechanisms by which replication factors accumulate at rf are conserved in evolution. we have, therefore, analyzed the ability of mammalian replication proteins to accumulate at the rf in drosophila cells and vice versa.

RESULTS
pcna is highly conserved in s. cerevisiae, d. melanogaster and mammals
the mechanistic basis for the association of replication factors with rf has been proposed to be mediated via interaction of pbd with pcna. to understand whether the pbd-mediated association of proteins with rf is conserved in evolution, we first analyzed the conservation of pcna protein sequence from divergent eucaryotes, especially the regions shown to interact with the pbd of p21cip1/waf <dig>  <cit> . the alignment in figure 1a shows that pcna is conserved in organisms as divergent as yeast, flies and mammals. hspcna is about 35% identical to scpcna and 70% identical to dmpcna. the residues of pcna that interact with the pbd of p21cip1/waf <dig> are more than 75% identical. also the pbd is conserved in homologous proteins involved in dna metabolism from archaebacteria, yeast, worms, flies, amphibians and mammals   suggesting that the association of proteins to rf mediated by pcna is a mechanism conserved through evolution. we put this hypothesis to test by analyzing whether the pbd containing mammalian replication proteins can accumulate at rf in drosophila cells.

human pcna and drosophila pcna can accumulate at rf across the two organisms
before testing whether replication proteins could accumulate at the rf across species and whether pcna binding would be required, we had to first establish whether the pcna in the two systems were interchangeable in that it could load onto rf in the heterologous system. to this end, we analyzed the association of human pcna  with rf in drosophila cells  and drosophila pcna  in mouse cells . as shown in figure  <dig> both have 70% overall amino acid identity.

expression plasmids encoding hspcna, gfp-hspcna and gfp-dmpcna were constructed and introduced into cells by calcium phosphate transfection. subnuclear localization of hspcna in transfected s <dig> cells was accomplished by indirect immunostaining with anti-pcna antibody  that reacted specifically with hspcna . transfected cells in s phase showed punctate brdu staining representing rf to which hspcna colocalized . also gfp-hspcna is targeted to rf in s <dig> cells . similarly, mammalian c2c <dig> cells expressing gfp-dmpcna showed complete colocalization of gfp-dmpcna with rf . since the available antibody against dmpcna cross reacts with mouse pcna, localization of untagged dmpcna in mouse cells was not possible. owing to the high sequence similarity of hspcna with dmpcna  and the conserved structure of pcna from divergent eucaryotes  <cit> , efficient association of hspcna with rf in s <dig> cells indicates that hspcna must be replacing endogenous pcna in s <dig> cells. thus, these results show that the basic replication machinery in the two organisms is conserved and core replication factors are interchangeable.

it appears from the images that the size of rf in drosophila are larger than in mammalian cells. however, measurement of the size of rf in mammalian cells showed that the average size of early/mid-s phase rf is  <dig>  μm  while in drosophila the average size is  <dig>  μm . the contrary appears to be the case in the images because drosophila nuclei are small and the images are presented at a higher digital zoom as can be seen from the different scale bars for mammalian and drosophila nuclei. further, compared to mammalian cells, there appears to be lower number of rf in drosophila cells. this is probably due to the smaller size of the drosophila genome .

subnuclear localization of pcna interacting proteins during s phase in drosophila cells
in order to determine whether the mechanisms mediating recruitment of proteins to rf in different organisms are conserved, we evaluated the ability of mammalian dnmt <dig> to accumulate at rf in drosophila s <dig> cells. s <dig> cells were transfected with plasmids encoding chimeric fusions of the n-terminal domain of dnmt <dig> with the gfp epitope  . nmt-gfp accumulated at rf in mouse c2c <dig> cells . nmt-gfp has a pbd and therefore it is predicted that this fusion protein should target to rf in drosophila s <dig> cells. surprisingly, nmt-gfp did not colocalize with rf in s <dig> cells . rather, in s <dig> cells, nmt-gfp seemed to be diffused throughout the nucleus as well as aggregating in some regions to form large structures. to test whether this is an artifact of the fusion protein in s <dig> cells, s <dig> cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding full length untagged dnmt <dig> and the association of dnmt <dig> with rf was analyzed. like nmt-gfp, dnmt <dig> did not accumulate at rf  in the majority of cells, though in about 10% cells in s phase dnmt <dig> seemed to partially colocalize with rf , or with a subset of drosophila chromatin. the latter did not correspond to the chromocenter . the extent of colocalization of dnmt <dig> and brdu was analyzed quantitatively by calculating the pearson's correlation coefficient  and mander's coefficient. the former gives an estimate of intensity-based correlation of the green  and red  signals. the pc value ranges from - <dig>  to + <dig>  with values in between indicating different degrees of partial correlation. the average pc value  for dnmt <dig> and brdu is  <dig>   indicating that there is a partial colocalization. the mander's coefficient measures the fraction of green  signal overlapping with red  signal and vice versa. on an average 23%  of dnmt <dig> signal showed overlap with brdu while 47%  of brdu signal showed overlap with the dnmt <dig>  this indicates that there is a higher proportion of dnmt <dig> that is present in regions devoid of brdu and there is a partial colocalization of dnmt <dig> and brdu. however, a closer look at the images shows that dnmt <dig> tends to accumulate in regions that are devoid of brdu and partial colocalization with brdu occurs in regions where the dnmt <dig> signal is lower than the average.

it is surprising that a pbd-containing protein that efficiently accumulates at rf in mammalian cells does not behave similarly in drosophila cells even though their basic replication machinery is similar. reduced efficiency in the targeting of dnmt1to rf in drosophila cells could be an artifact of a protein that is foreign to drosophila as this organism lacks a dnmt1homologue. so we tested the targeting of human dna ligase i  to rf in s <dig> cells. dna ligase i is a core replication enzyme involved in ligating okazaki fragments during synthesis of the lagging strand. dna ligase i is conserved in evolutionarily distant organisms and the drosophila dna ligase i  homologue is 50% identical to hsdna lig i . a gfp fusion of hsdna lig i was expressed in s <dig> cells and its subnuclear localization was analyzed. gfp-hslig showed a diffused nuclear distribution in s <dig> cells in all interphase stages without any discernible colocalization with rf in s phase . in contrast, as shown previously  <cit> , gfp-hslig was efficiently targeted to rf in mouse cells . strikingly, the inability of gfp-hslig to accumulate at rf in any of the s <dig> cells in s phase suggested that the pbd is unable to function as a replication foci targeting sequence  in drosophila. to further test this, the pbd from dnmt <dig>  and hsdna lig i  were individually fused to gfp and expressed in drosophila cells. both mtpbd-gfp and hsligpbd-gfp were diffusely distributed in the nucleus and did not show any discernible localization or exclusion from the rf . the same fusions though were clearly targeted to rf in mammalian cells . thus, even though the  <dig> aa pbd plus the  <dig> aa region rich in basic residues are enough for targeting to rf as observed in mouse cells, it is unable to do so in drosophila cells. alternatively, in drosophila, the mechanism behind recruitment of proteins to rf may not be dependent on the pbd, but rather some other unique protein motif might function as an rfts.

search for an rfts in drosophila
to determine whether another protein sequence functions as an rfts in drosophila, we sought to clone a replication protein from drosophila and identify its rfts. since dna ligase i is well conserved from yeast to humans, we searched the drosophila genome database and the est database   <cit>  for putative dna ligase i homologues with dna ligase i sequence from different organisms  as query. three putative homologues were identified in the est database, viz. ld <dig>  at <dig>  and ld <dig> with corresponding predicted proteins cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> respectively . comparison of the protein sequences of these potential homologues with hsdna lig i showed that the putative dna ligase i in drosophila is cg <dig> . the est clone  coding for cg <dig> was obtained and the sequence was verified. an  <dig> bp segment in the coding region of the predicted gene was found to be absent in the cdna clone . the dmdna lig i protein sequence was analyzed in order to identify sequences similar to the pbd. this revealed the presence of a pbd sequence  that had all the features of hsdna lig i-pbd required for accumulation at replication foci, viz. the  <dig> amino acid region interacting with pcna immediately followed by the  <dig> amino acid sequence rich in basic residues . additionally, two sequences with weak similarity to the conserved pbd were identified and called as pbd- <dig> and - <dig> .

to determine whether dmdna lig i employs some other protein sequence as an rfts instead of the conserved pbd, a series of deletion mutants of dmdna lig i fused to gfp were constructed  and their subnuclear localization with respect to rf was analyzed in both mouse and drosophila cells. immunoblotting analysis showed that proteins of the correct size were expressed from these plasmids . the full length protein fused to gfp  did not show accumulation at rf in drosophila s <dig> cells , whereas it colocalized with rf in mammalian c2c <dig> cells . none of the deletions, gdl- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  showed colocalization with rf in both drosophila and mammalian cells . thus, neither the full length dmdna lig i nor any of the deletions fused to gfp accumulated at rf in drosophila cells. the fact that only gdl, but none of gdl- <dig> to  <dig> associates with rf in mouse cells indicates that this association is mediated by the dmdna lig i-pbd. thus, the ability of the minimal dmdna lig i-pbd to accumulate at rf in drosophila and mouse cells was analyzed. as observed with hsligpbd-gfp and mtpbd-gfp , dmligpbd-gfp colocalized with rf in mammalian c2c <dig> cells but not in drosophila s <dig> cells . taken together, these results show that:  dmdna lig i associates with rf in mouse cells via the dmdna lig i-pbd;  interestingly, dmdna lig i does not accumulate at rf in drosophila cells.

in summary, except for pcna none of the other replication proteins accumulate at rf in drosophila cells. most notably, dmdna lig i does not accumulate at rf in drosophila cells while it does so in mouse cells. this probably indicates a fundamental difference in the kinetics of association of proteins with rf in drosophila cells and mammalian cells.

discussion
the observation that immunostaining for pcna and brdu incorporation sites gives a punctate pattern indicates that in drosophila cells, like mammalian cells, dna replication is organized in discrete structures or rf . this is consistent with the previous observation that replication in drosophila kc cells occurs at subnuclear foci  <cit> . the polymerase clamp pcna is highly conserved between human and drosophila  and hspcna and dmpcna can efficiently accumulate at rf across the two organisms . this indicates that pcna, a conserved central core at the replication fork, is structurally and functionally exchangeable at the rf between mammals and drosophila. in a recent report, kisielewska et al. showed that gfp-pcna can be used as an s-phase marker in early stage embryo during syncytial nuclear divisions  <cit> . however, this study revealed that there is no punctate accumulation of gfp-hspcna during these early embryonic nuclear divisions. our own unpublished results on live transgenic drosophila embryos expressing gfp-hspcna corroborate these results. inability of gfp-hspcna to form rf in these early cell division cycles is best explained by the short s phases resulting from firing of closely spaced origins unlike that in adult cells.

it has been proposed based on homology search data that proteins with pbd accumulate at rf in s phase cells  <cit> . however, in drosophila cells pcna interacting proteins  did not show any accumulation at rf . due to the general inability of pbd-gfp fusions from different origins  to accumulate at rf in drosophila cells, we argued that in drosophila another domain might function as an rfts. however, deletion analysis of dmdna ligase i fused to gfp showed that neither the full length dmdna ligase i nor any of the deletions accumulated at rf in drosophila cells . however, dmdna ligase i accumulated at rf in mammalian cells via its pbd . this also indicates that dmdna ligase i fused to gfp is expressed and folded properly and that the inability to accumulate at rf in drosophila cells cannot be attributed to improper expression or misfolding.

the absence of accumulation of both hsdna lig i and dmdna lig i at rf in drosophila cells, and rather a diffused nuclear distribution, could be attributed to a high background of overexpressed protein that might occlude accumulation at rf. such occluded accumulation could be then revealed by detergent extraction of soluble proteins  <cit> . however, the cmv-ie promoter used in all the expression vectors here is much weaker in drosophila cells compared to the mammalian cells. the expression is about  <dig> times lower in drosophila cells compared to mammalian cells as indicated by the observation that the intensity of gfp signal in drosophila cells is  <dig> times less than that in mammalian cells. thus, lower expression levels in drosophila cells preclude masking of gfp-fusion protein accumulation at rf.

interestingly, amongst the various pcna-binding proteins tested only dnmt <dig> and its deletion, nmt, showed some punctate distribution in the nucleus, which was though mostly excluded from brdu stained regions. this punctate pattern was more evident with nmt whereas the gfp fusions of hsdna lig i and dmdna lig i showed more diffused nuclear pattern. in mammalian cells dnmt <dig> shows a preference for heterochromatic regions via a domain in its n-terminus called ts during the g <dig> phase. analysis of the punctate dnmt <dig> pattern with drosophila heterochromatin stained using anti-hp <dig> antibody did not reveal any preferential accumulation of dnmt <dig> at drosophila heterochromatin . thus, it is not completely clear what the punctate dnmt <dig> pattern means. further, this punctate pattern is more pronounced with nmt-gfp where the accumulation tends to be around the nucleolus in most cells . one explanation for this accumulation could be that the n-terminal domain of dnmt <dig> has multiple functional domains that have been show to interact with dna and various proteins  in mammalian cells. in mammalian cells these interactions are regulated, for example, we have shown that the interaction with pcna is cell cycle dependent  <cit> . however, dnmt <dig> being a completely foreign protein in drosophila cells, these interactions or other non-specific interactions might not be regulated, which probably results in some aggregation.

the fact that except for pcna, no localization at drosophila rf was observed with the other replication factors analyzed here does not rule out very transient and short-lived associations of these factors with the rf. this is supported by recent studies from our group where clear differences in the mobility and interaction of pcna binding proteins and pcna with rf were measured. whereas pcna formed a stable accumulation at the rf, pcna interacting proteins like dna ligase i and feni only transiently associated and were not stable components of the replication machinery  <cit> . thus, lack of accumulation of proteins at rf does not exclude interaction with components at rf. this could be true for studies on other proteins and their cognate cellular structures and lack of accumulation cannot be interpreted as absence of activity at the respective cellular structures.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, no accumulation of replication factors at rf could be detected in drosophila cells, suggesting a fundamental difference between drosophila and mammalian cells. while replication in drosophila cells seems to rely on transient interaction with highly mobile factors, mammalian cells seem to have evolved more stable interactions with higher order structures possibly to cope with the challenges of replicating a genome  <dig> times as big as the fly genome.
