BACKGROUND
the prevalence of pine wilt disease  in european and asian forestlands causes significant environmental and economical effects, which have encouraged vulnerable countries to strengthen pest control management policies  <cit> . the primary pathogenic agent of pwd is the plant-parasitic nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus   <cit> . pwn infects coniferous trees, mostly pinus sp., using an insect-vector, monochamus sp., for tree-to-tree transmission  <cit> . in the last decade, the parasitism of b. xylophilus has been intensively investigated . in  <dig>  kikuchi et al.  <cit>  published a draft genome sequence for pwn revealing its distinct and unique parasitism tools including enzymes for metabolism of the host cell wall and detoxification enzymes. shinya and co-workers  <cit>  investigated the pwn secretome and identified a range of secreted cell-wall degrading enzymes and host-defense evasion proteins, among which  <dig> antioxidant enzymes  were identified. more recently, vicente et al.  <cit>  showed the importance of pwn catalases in h2o <dig> detoxification in vitro, and espada et al.  <cit>  identified novel proteins involved in the host-parasite interaction and provided clear evidence that pwn employs a multilayered detoxification strategy to overcome plant defenses.

pwn-associated bacteria have been suggested to play an important role in the development of pwd . a dual role has been attributed to these bacteria due to their phenotypic plasticity, expressing both plant pathogenic and plant growth promoting abilities  <cit> . these nematode-associated bacteria were initially seen as putative pwn’s symbiotic partners in pwd , though lately paiva et al.  <cit>  has shown also in vitro nematicidal activity of some associated bacteria. in spite of the intricate detoxification system present in pwn, cheng et al.  <cit>  and vicente et al.  <cit>  have shown the potential of pwn-associated bacteria, respectively, in the xenobiotic degradation and in the neutralization of h2o <dig> 

reactive oxygen species  have important roles in plant physiological processes such as growth and development, response to biotic and abiotic stresses and programmed cell death  <cit> . in host-pathogen interactions, apoplastic ros production, also known as the oxidative burst, is one of the earliest detectable events in plant basal defenses  <cit> . this production is biphasic: the first phase is non-specific, relatively weak and occurs within minutes of the plant detecting a potential pathogen while the second occurs after prolonged pathogen attack, resulting in establishment of plant defenses and may be accompanied by a hypersensitive response  <cit> . h2o <dig>  hydrogen peroxide, is the most stable, and membrane diffusible ros  <cit> . h2o <dig> has a variety of roles in plants; at low concentrations it serves as a signaling molecule for the plant  but, at high concentrations, can lead to oxidative stress and cell death  <cit> . avirulent pathogens induce biphasic ros. however, in the case of virulent pathogens or symbiotic partners, which can avoid or suppress host recognition, only the first ros wave is detected  <cit> . in these situations, both plant and pathogen attempt to regulate intracellular and extracellular ros accumulation by employing several enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as: ascorbate peroxidases, gpxs, sods, cat or kat, prxs and glutathione s-transferases   <cit> .

vicente et al.  <cit>  reported, for the first time, the high tolerance to oxidative stress of three pwn-associated bacteria , showing also the beneficial effect towards pwn under the same conditions. in the present work, we investigated the biology of serratia sp. lcn <dig> through genome analyses, and further studied, using reverse genetics, the role of two genes directly involved in the neutralization of h2o <dig>  namely the h2o <dig> transcriptional factor oxyr; and the h2o <dig> targeting enzyme, catalase .

the nucleotide sequence of the lcn <dig> oxyr gene  is 918 bp long and is located between fabr , a predicted hth-type transcriptional repressor protein, and lcn16_ <dig>  a predicted glutathione peroxidase-like protein. the oxyr sequence encodes a 34 kda unstable protein  with a predicted lysr-type hth domain . the oxyr protein was 100 % identical to the orthologous sequences from s. proteamaculans  <dig> and s. grimessii cr62_ <dig>  99 % identical to the s. liquefaciens atcc  <dig>  and shares 88 % identity with the e. coli k- <dig> protein. the serratia sp. lcn <dig> catalase  gene  is 1437 bp long, and is located between lcn16_ <dig>  a predicted yfaz precursor, and a cluster of genes menecbhdf , presumably involved in the menaquinone  biosynthesis. this gene encodes a 54 kda stable protein  with a catalase_ <dig> domain , and shares 99 % identity with s. grimessii cr62_ <dig>  98 % with s. proteamaculans  <dig> and s. liquefaciens atcc  <dig>  and only 42 % identity with e. coli k.  <dig>  <cit> .

using targetron® , a mobile group ii intron was modified  to be specifically inserted into oxyr and kata genes in serratia sp. lcn <dig>  the insertion of the retargeted introns  in the predicted positions, serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int and serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int, were confirmed by pcr . as foreseen in s. proteamaculans  <dig> genome through operondb and operondetection tools  <cit> , we also predict that, in serratia sp. lcn <dig>  both genes are independently transcribed , which may indicate that the serratia sp. lcn <dig> mutants’ phenotype are only due to these mutated genes.fig.  <dig> colony pcr results indicating that group ii intron-based vectors successfully targeted the serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr and kat genes. a introns were inserted in the position 614| <dig> of oxyr gene, oxyr::int; and in the position 808| <dig> of kata gene, kata::int. for both genes, the arrows indicate the position of forward and reverse primers designed to infer intron insertion. b l <dig> and l <dig> indicate 100-bp and 1-kb molecular markers, respectively. l <dig> and l <dig> correspond to the oxyr  and kata  fragments. l <dig> and l <dig> correspond to mobile group ii intron integrated in oxyr  and kata , respectively



the growth of serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt and mutants is shown in fig. 4a. slightly changes were observed in wild-type and mutants’ generation times. the generation time of serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt was  <dig>  h, and the generation times of serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int and oxyr::int were, respectively,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h. the tolerance to h2o <dig> was considerably affected in the oxyr and kata mutants . the h2o <dig>  inhibition was higher in serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int than in serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int . both mutants were statistically different  than the wild-type. at 50 mm and 100 mm h2o <dig>  both mutants were completely inhibited while serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt grew easily . consequently, both failed to protect b. xylophilus ka <dig> after 24 h exposure to 50 mm h2o <dig> . no statistical differences were seen between b. xylophilus ka <dig> and b. xylophilus ka4_lcn <dig> oxyr::int/lcn <dig> kata::int , with mortality ranging between  <dig> and 99 %. only b. xylophilus ka4_lcn <dig> wt could reduce significantly  b. xylophilus ka <dig> mortality to  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> characterization of h2o2-sensitive serratia sp. lcn <dig>  and kata::int) and resistant serratia sp. lcn <dig> wild-type : growth curves ; h2o <dig> inhibition  ; growth in 24 h exposure to h2o <dig> ; and biofilm production . h2o <dig> inhibition was determined by measuring the diameter of the halo surrounding the h2o <dig>  spot-inoculation. biofilm production was determined as described in  <cit> . error bars indicate standard deviation. asterisk  on the top of the columns denotes statistical differences at 95–99 % confidence level by students t-test , when compared with wild-type serratia sp. lcn16



biofilm production  was only compromised in serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int, with a significant reduction  in comparison with serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt. no significant differences  were seen between serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt and serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int. in terms of swimming and swarming abilities , only serratia sp. oxyr::int swimming trait was improved.fig.  <dig> swimming  and swarming  behaviors of h2o2-sensitive mutants serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int and kata::int and resistant serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt. only serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int change the swimming behavior as it grown further in the semisolid medium. no effects were seen in swarming behaviors of mutants and wild-type 



relative gene expression of oxyr, kata, katg was analyzed in mid-log phase for the serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt and mutants . in terms of the relative expression of oxyr , only serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt showed a  <dig> -fold induction, while for lcn <dig> oxyr:: and lcn <dig> kata:: oxyr the expression levels remained unchanged. statistical differences  were only detected comparing relative expression of oxyr of wt and lcn <dig> kata::. for the relative expression of kata, only serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt showed a  <dig> -fold induction. the relative expression of kata in lcn <dig> oxyr:: was almost similar between stress and non-stress conditions with a slight induction of  <dig> -fold. for the lcn <dig> kata:: mutant, kata expression was almost null indicating successful mutation of this gene. statistical differences  were only seen between wt and lcn <dig> kata::. the relative gene expression of katg was considerably high in lcn <dig> wt and lcn <dig> kata::, respectively  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold. since katg is under regulation of oxyr, its expression is supposed to be comprised in lcn <dig> oxyr:: mutant. thus, the relative expression of katg in lcn <dig> oxyr:: was equal between stress and non-stress conditions and statistically different  from wt.fig.  <dig> relative gene expression of oxyr, kata and katg genes in wild-type serratia sp. lcn <dig>  and serratia sp. lcn <dig> mutants  and kata::int), after h2o2-shock induction. the x-axis was positioned for  <dig> , which indicates that the level of gene expression between stress and non-stress conditions is similar. values were normalized using reference gene gyra, and analyzed with ΔΔct method. error bars indicate standard deviation. asterisk  on the top of the columns denotes statistical differences at 95–99 % confidence level by students t-test , when compared with wild-type serratia sp. lcn16



discussion
forest trees harbor population densities of endophytic bacteria ranging between  <dig> and 106 cfu  per gram of sample, most of which are host-specific  <cit> . genomes of plant-associated bacteria reflect a wide spectrum of life style adaptations  <cit> . therefore, we cannot dismiss the potential of bacteria when we are trying to understand a particular ecosystem. in the present study, we characterized the biology of serratia sp. lcn <dig> analyzing, in detail, its genome content, and investigated the role oxyr and kata in the extreme oxidative stress resistance of this pwn-associated bacteria.

members of the genus serratia are ecological generalists found inhabiting water, soil, plants, animals and humans  <cit> . belonging to the phytosphere serratia group  <cit> , also known as serratia liquefaciens complex  <cit> , serratia sp. lcn <dig> is phylogenetically closest to the poplar endophyte s. proteamaculans  <dig>  <cit>  and s. liquefaciens strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> . however, this taxonomical identification may be incomplete due to the lack of complete genome sequence for other serratia such as s. grimessi strain a <dig>  <cit> , which is also included in the s. liquefaciens complex  <cit> . serratia sp. lcn <dig> shares many features with endophytic bacteria, such as plant polymer degrading enzymes, iron uptake/transport, siderophore and phytohormone  synthesis, and aromatic compound degradation  <cit> , some of which are supported by the previous phenotypic characterization  <cit> . wilted pine trees are a rich source of fungi, which in the late-stages of pwd are consumed by pwn  <cit> . serratia sp. lcn <dig>  isolated from the cuticle of fungi-cultivated b. xylophilus  <cit> , harbors genes involved in the production of antifungal agents  and chitinases, which may explain its survival and persistence in b. xylophilus lab-culture. genes encoding other antimicrobial compounds were found in serratia sp. lcn <dig>  which can give a fitness advantage to this bacterium in a more complex environment such as host pine trees  <cit> . few mgis were found in serratia sp. lcn <dig> suggesting a more stable genome probably adapted to a less broad environment as described elsewhere  <cit> .

endophytes have highly elaborate detoxification mechanisms to counter-attack host ros  <cit> . vicente et al.  <cit>  showed that serratia sp. lcn <dig> is highly h2o2-tolerant bacterium. a total of  <dig> antioxidant enzymes were found in the serratia sp. lcn <dig> genome, which is within the range described in other endophytes   <cit> . serratia sp. lcn <dig> is a copious siderophore producer  <cit> , rich in iron uptake and transport systems  and, recently, li et al.  <cit>  reported the importance of siderophore synthesis and iron uptake systems in the resistance against oxidative stress of insect-gut elizabethkingia anophelis nuhp <dig>  the relation between oxidative stress and siderophore synthesis has also been explored in the fungus alternaria alternata  <cit>  and in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> .

mobile group ii introns are retroelements, which through retrohoming mechanism, can be inserted into a dna target site in a site-specific manner via the activity of an associated intron-encoded enzyme protein  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  could efficiently disrupt the acid production pathways in clostridium beijinrinckii by the insertion of group ii intron specifically retargeted to pta  and buk . using this gene knockout system, we obtained two mutants, serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int and serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int, disrupting respectively, oxyr and kata genes. both genes have been investigated for their direct involvement in oxidative stress in several organisms . the oxyr is a global regulator of peroxide stress response that maintains intracellular h2o <dig> homeostasis, and it is known to regulate several genes involved in h2o <dig> detoxification   <cit> . the serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int was severely impaired in its ability to survive in high h2o <dig> conditions in vitro, highly affected in biofilm production  and swimming abilities. our results are corroborated by shank et al.  <cit> , which previously observed that serratia marcescens oxyr mediated oxidative stress response, biofilm formation and surface attachment. the high sequence similarity between serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr and e. coli k <dig>  suggests that serratia sp. lcn <dig> utilizes a similar mechanism of regulation as e. coli. under high h2o <dig> stress conditions, oxyr  is oxidized triggering conformational changes  leading to the regulation of several proteins including the expression of katg  <cit> . this effect was clearly seen in our results. the expression of katg was significantly down regulated in serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int , suggesting its oxyr-dependent regulation. the importance of katg has been observed in several studies. jamet et al.  <cit>  observed the role of katg as a mediator of bacteria-plant interaction for sinorhizobium meliloti, reporting its constitutive expression and considering katg to be a housekeeping gene. mycobacterium tuberculosis, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, also relies on katg for its resistance to high oxidative stress environments  <cit> . serratia sp. lcn <dig> encodes also other catalase, kata , which is homologous with e. coli kate. serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int was affected in h2o <dig> resistance but not in biofilm production nor swimming and swarming traits. the expression of the kata in serratia sp. lcn <dig> wt was slightly induced when compared with katg, indicating that its expression in exponential phase is reduced. in oxyr mutant, kata expression was relatively closest to the expression level showed in wildtype, suggesting to be regulated in a oxyr-independent manner. in e. coli, kate is transcriptionally regulated in the stationary phase by rpos  <cit> . as for katg, kata was also found important in bacteria-plant interaction  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed the potential of pwn-associated bacteria serratia sp. lcn <dig> to live in a plant-environment, and also that its high tolerance to oxidative stress is oxyr- and kata-dependent. in the pwd context, we showed that serratia sp. lcn <dig> oxyr::int and serratia sp. lcn <dig> kata::int failed to protect pwn against h2o <dig> oxidative conditions. as previously hypothesized  <cit> , pwn-associated bacteria may opportunistically assist the nematode in the disease by amelioration of oxidative burst of pine defenses. through this study, we have set the proper conditions to explore bacteria-nematode association in planta environment.
