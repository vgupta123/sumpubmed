BACKGROUND
daphnia magna has been used in biological research since the 18th century  <cit> . at the beginning of  <dig>  a search for daphnia in isi web of knowledgesm returned over  <dig>  results starting from year  <dig>  <cit> . d. magna is a target of many studies in evolution, ecology and ecotoxicology  <cit> . as a species, it is a relatively large , widespread and easy to maintain. normally d. magna reproduces asexually, but it is possible to trigger sexual reproduction under controlled conditions, which is less easy in other members of the daphnia genus. d. magna is also an ecologically important species in freshwater environments as it is a key grazer of algae while also being the preferred prey of fish  <cit> . it is widespread in the northern hemisphere, especially in the palearctic  <cit> . moreover, the taxonomy of d. magna is relatively straightforward compared to that of the d. pulex and d. longispina species complexes  <cit> . an advantage of d. magna over d. pulex is the relative ease of triggering sexual reproduction and hatching dormant eggs. we are rapidly acquiring new genomics tools for d. magna such as the genome project which all can be found in daphnia genomics consortium webpage  <cit> . these attributes make this species a very desirable model organism for genetic studies.

the d. pulex linkage map is the first and most important reference point in comparing the genetic architecture of d. magna. these two species resemble each other phenotypically and share similar broad ecological niches. the divergence between d. pulex and d. magna had been estimated from mtdna sequences to be about  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, recent estimates of divergence time between these species, measured using nuclear genes, is reduced to  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya depending on parameters  <cit> .

d. magna is part of the sub-genus ctenodaphnia, which have been reported to have  <dig> chromosomes   <cit> . d. pulex  has  <dig> chromosomes, and its genetic map revealed  <dig> linkage groups   <cit> . chromosomes in daphnia are small and contracted; thus, karyotypes are difficult to determine  <cit> . d. magna has no sex-chromosomes because sex determination in daphnia is environmentally induced, so that the same genotype can be either male or female.

dominant markers like aflps, rflps and rapds are fast and provide evidence of the overall genetic architecture, but do not effectively disentangle the exact genes responsible for trait differences  <cit> . variable numbers of tandem repeats  or microsatellite markers, on the other hand, are codominant markers and therefore provide more information. here we report on a d. magna linkage study using microsatellite markers. the map is part of a larger qtl study aimed at detecting qtls for various phenotypic traits. the map will also be instrumental in assembling the ongoing d. magna genome project.

the first objective of this study was to generate a linkage map of d. magna based on  <dig> vntr marker loci. the second objective was to provide a test case of the d. magna linkage map's potential in qtl mapping. combined with the published d. pulex linkage map, the linkage maps form a first-generation tool for comparative genomics of daphnia.

RESULTS
linkage groups
the sum of kosambi corrected map units was  <dig>  centimorgans  for the d. magna map . the average interval for the markers in the linkage groups was  <dig>  cm. the linkage analysis of the f <dig> panel resulted in  <dig> linkage groups of more than  <dig> cm with considerable variation in length . the largest linkage group was  <dig>  cm, and the tenth largest linkage group was  <dig>  cm. there were  <dig> unlinked markers and  <dig> small linkage groups  ranging from 0- <dig>  cm, indicating that our linkage map is not yet complete. the total length of unlinked small linkage groups was  <dig>  cm, which is about 4% of the total map length. from all markers that were used,  <dig>  percent showed linkage in the ten largest linkage groups. many of the unlinked markers as well as the short duplets and triplets showed weak associations to the longer linkage groups . however, they could not be connected to the linkage groups with the critical recombination fraction value of  <dig> haldane cm  <cit>  and a lod score of  <dig>  the obtained haldane distances were transformed to kosambi  <cit>  distances, which provide a better estimate of the real distances between markers by including recombination interference  <cit> . the est vntr markers are also directly mapped genes that are listed in additional file  <dig> with their putative functions.

transmission ratio distortion 
the overall number of heterozygote genotypes was  <dig>  percent. the average frequency of heterozygotes did not deviate significantly from the expected distribution of 1:2: <dig> in f <dig> intercross design . however, individual markers had significant deviations of expected allele distribution .

trd was detected in 33% of the markers. significant trds occurred in several clusters. the majority of the trd was caused by a lack of heterozygotes , which was pronounced especially in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> . a lack of homozygotes was seen only in  <dig> markers belonging to linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> .

infertility alleles
iinb <dig> clone carried an infertility allele causing dwarfism, red coloration, and no egg production. we called this phenotype red dwarf . xinb <dig> clone carried an infertility allele causing an otherwise normal phenotype with the exception that asexual eggs would not hatch and no ephippia were produced--here called unviable eggs . rd infertility allele mapped close to marker pair p <dig>  and p <dig> . both these markers sit on the small linkage group  <dig> , which is not connected to the main groups. the ue allele mapped close to markers p <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig> , which are part of linkage group  <dig> . the regions in which ue and rd alleles were located were not linked . the infertility allele associations could be traced to the parental genotype/allele. rd infertility allele came from iinb <dig> , whereas ue infertility allele came from xinb <dig> . we confirmed the origin of these two infertility alleles by selfing the parental clones, which resulted in approximately 25% of the infertility phenotypes in the selfed offspring of both parental lines. this is expected for a fully recessive allele being heterozygote in the parental type. the proportions of infertile individuals in f <dig> individuals were  <dig> rd,  <dig> ue and  <dig> fertile. these proportions follow the expected distribution of two recessive alleles in two unlinked loci. when the females showing infertility were excluded from the analysis, the χ <dig> tests of trd were p <dig> , p <dig>  for the ue type, and p <dig>  and p <dig>   for the rd type. but when sterile females  were added to the analysis, the χ <dig> values were strongly reduced and nonsignificant in the case of the ue type , p <dig> , p <dig> , p <dig> ). the four markers associated with the two infertility alleles are the four markers that show homozygote deficiency in fig.  <dig> .

corrected linkage map length and coverage
the corrected linkage map length was  <dig>  cm for the ten largest linkage groups, which increased to  <dig>  cm when the unlinked smaller linkage groups were added. the coverage of the genome was  <dig> %. the expected distance from a closest marker to a random gene was  <dig>  cm when all the linkage groups and markers in them were used in the analysis.

genotyping error
genotyping error was estimated to be  <dig>  percent, which is slightly higher than the d. pulex linkage map estimate. to reduce the impact of potential errors, a small number of marker loci that produced ambiguous results were excluded from the linkage analysis.

discussion
the expected number of chromosomes in d. magna is  <dig>   <cit> . our d. magna linkage map has ten linkage groups exceeding  <dig> cm. these are the best candidates for the ten linkage groups in the d. magna genome. however, the linkage map is a statistical approximation of the recombination pattern and thus not necessarily identical to the physical map.

the linkage map of d. pulex consists of  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . the putative ten linkage groups in d. magna differ in some aspects from those of the d. pulex linkage groups. there is one large linkage group of  <dig>  cm, which is approximately one third larger than the largest linkage group in the d. pulex linkage map. the lengths of the two genetic maps are rather close. the d. pulex kosambi corrected linkage map spanned  <dig> cm  <cit> , whereas the d. magna extends  <dig>  kosambi cm. even if we exclude the unlinked small linkage groups, the putative linkage map of the ten chromosomes extends  <dig>  cm. we used  <dig> markers whereas for the d. pulex map  <dig> markers were used  <cit> . as a consequence, the average marker interval in the d. pulex linkage map is only  <dig> cm, as compared to rather larger  <dig> cm in the d. magna linkage map. however, in the d. pulex linkage map, a relatively large number  of loci are at identical positions, possibly because the number of clonal lines  used for the d. pulex linkage map is lower  compared to  <dig> for d. magna map. in the d. magna map, hardly any markers are at identical positions .

a number of loci are not linked to the putative ten linkage groups of d. magna. this may be a result of incomplete linkage groups, which in turn suggests that the linkage groups extend further than in the present linkage map. there is also some indication of linkage between the unlinked loci themselves. the linkage map of d. pulex also resulted in some unlinked loci, but much less than in our study, which is likely to be explained by the smaller average marker distance  <cit> .

we found several cases of trd, i.e. deviations of the expected genotype distributions in the f <dig> cross . in two cases, trd was caused by infertility alleles, which are heterozygote in the parental clones, with both alleles present in the f <dig> hybrid clone. when the genotypes of the sterile individuals are included into the χ2-test of linkage distortion, the χ <dig> values are strongly reduced in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the main cause of trd in the d. magna linkage map is the lack of heterozygotes . cristescu et al  <cit>  found that 21% of their markers showed trd, resulting in four regions that span about  <dig> to  <dig> cm. in contrast to the d. magna map, trd in the d. pulex map was mainly caused by a lack of homozygotes  <cit> . d. magna has ten regions of trd from  <dig>  cm to  <dig> cm, covering 31% of the markers. an important factor influencing trd in linkage studies is the genetic distance between the parental lines. linkage studies on more distantly related parental strains report larger trd proportions  <cit> , with the strongest trd in qtl studies between species  <cit> . this may be a consequence of losing synergistic epistatic interactions and resolved genetic conflicts between loci  <cit> . the parental lines of our panel came from d. magna populations that are strongly differentiated ecologically, about  <dig> kilometers apart. it is likely that trd caused by lack of heterozygotes in our study is influenced primarily by the large diversity of the parents, which makes their genomes partially incompatible.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the overall coverage of the d. magna genome by the linkage map described here and on the similarities of the d. magna and d. pulex linkage maps, we can infer that our d. magna linkage map captures the main elements of the genetic architecture of the d. magna genome. we used infertility alleles present in the parental lines to test that the f <dig> panel could successfully map the genetic basis of two recessive traits with simple genetics. this linkage map provides a starting point for targeted qtl studies and will be helpful in assembling the d. magna genome. it will need further refining using newly developed markers, and should in time help provide a true physical map of the d. magna genome.
