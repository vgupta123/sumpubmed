BACKGROUND
the sino-nasal mucosa is an important interface with the environment and represents a dynamic system for innate host defence  <cit> . in addition to providing a barrier to the entry of pathogens, epithelial cells lining the airway are able to recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . toll-like receptors  are situated on these cells and on dendritic cell populations in this location and appear to play crucial roles in the distinction between commensal flora and pamps. single nucleotide polymorphisms  within the tlr genes have been reported to impact the immune reaction to microbial antigens, and to be associated with the incidence and outcome of infections  <cit> . collectively, the tlrs cover the recognition of a wide variety of pathogens . tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are particularly associated with recognition of fungi   <cit> – <cit> , and snps in these tlrs have been associated with higher risk of fungal disease in man  <cit> .

in dogs, sino-nasal aspergillosis  is a cause of chronic rhinitis, and the disease is most often caused by a. fumigatus <cit> . sna is characterized by the formation of superficial mucosal fungal plaques within the nasal cavity and/or frontal sinus, associated with a severe mucosal inflammatory response and a local destruction of nasal bone  <cit> . as the disease usually affects systemically healthy dogs, and a. fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungus, a local immune deficiency in affected dogs has been suggested  <cit> .

the clinicopathological features of sna are similar to those of human chronic erosive non-invasive fungal sinusitis  <cit> . although tlrs have not been studied in this type of sinusitis in people, they have been better characterized in chronic rhinosinusitis  including fungal crs, and some forms of aspergillosis. pathogenesis of the crs complex remains unclear, but association of this disease with tlr polymorphisms, particularly tlr <dig> snps, has been described  <cit> .

association between tlr snps and incidence of various forms of human aspergillus infection have been reported. a significant association between the incidence of invasive aspergillosis  in recipients of transplanted allogeneic stem cells and the presence of some tlr <dig> snps in donors has been reported  <cit> , <cit> . hence, carvalho et al. <cit>  have described an increased frequency of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis among tlr <dig> snp carriers. in the same study, a snp in tlr <dig> was shown to predispose to the allergic form of pulmonary aspergillosis.

polymorphisms in tlr genes have not yet been described in dogs with sna, but alteration in these receptors could hamper their function, therefore disrupting the recognition of fungi, eventually leading to fungal escape from immune surveillance. recently, up-regulation of tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrna expression has been reported in the nasal mucosa of affected dogs  <cit> . comparison of the canine and human tlr genetic sequences show a high degree of homology  <cit> ; suggesting the polymorphisms in tlr genes found in people with aspergillosis and/or fungal crs might also be observed in dogs.

a retrospective analysis of the medical records at the veterinary clinic of the university  of liège  over the last 5 years revealed four predominant canine breeds diagnosed with sna: golden retriever, labrador retriever, rottweiler and beauceron sheepdog. a candidate gene approach was used to test the hypothesis that snps in tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were associated with canine sna. the presence of non-synonymous snps in the coding regions of the tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes was investigated by direct sequencing of pcr-amplified products from these regions, using dna from nine dogs with sna belonging to various breeds . secondly, a combination of allele-specific primers and taq-man probe-based pcr genotyping was applied to samples from affected and control dogs derived from these four breeds in order to assess the significance of these snps in canine sna.

RESULTS
selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms
the initial part of the study focused on a mutational analysis of tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in nine dogs with sna belonging to various breeds. this analysis revealed two non-synonymous snps in the coding region of tlr2: c137a  and c1547t . eight non-synonymous snps were identified in the tlr <dig> exons: t23c , c107t , t500c , a600c , a688g , g1039a , a1571t  and g1807a . four non-synonymous snps were identified in tlr <dig> exon: g1138a , a1372c , a2158g  and g2927a .

all non-synonymous snps identified resulted in a change in the class of amino acid coded .

snp genotyping and association study
to assess the significance of the identified snps, the allelic frequencies in a group of dogs with sna belonging to four breeds commonly affected by sna  were compared with those found in control dogs of the same breeds , and no significant difference was found. two snps  were found monomorphic between and within samples from the four selected breeds.

discussion
the present study investigated the association between snps in tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, and the risk of developing sna in dogs. in the first part of the study, sequencing of the coding regions of these genes in nine dogs with sna  revealed two, eight and four non-synonymous snps in the coding region of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes, respectively. in the second part of the study, no association was found between these snps and the presence of sna.

some of the snps identified in the first part of the study were not found in samples from the four breeds of dog genotyped in the second part, and minor allele frequencies varied extensively between breeds, with some uncommon alleles in one breed becoming the most common alleles in the other, and vice versa. this supports a wide genetic variations between canine breeds  <cit> .

the only result close to significance was found for tlr <dig> c137a snp in the golden retrievers. due to the unpredictable direction of allelic frequency shift between dogs with sna and controls, plink software was used to compute two-tailed fisher’s exact test p-values. using a one tailed test would have led to half the actual p-value , thereby reaching significance. although this might be interpreted as a significant result, the rationale for choosing a one-tailed test might be debated. furthermore, multiple testing issues  could be considered, leading to a lowered significance threshold that would make this result not significant. on the other hand, the power of the test might be low due to the relatively small size of the sample. therefore, this snp could merit further investigation with a larger number of dogs.

although some researchers have studied the association between tlr snps in human crs and some fungal diseases, the results are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. several researchers have shown a significant association between tlr <dig> and/or tlr <dig> snps and the incidence of several forms of aspergillosis  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> ; however, another study failed to associate these polymorphisms with that disease. recently, carvalho et al. noted a positive association between tlr <dig> snps and fungal colonization, but not susceptibility to fungal infection  <cit> . kesh et al. did not report any positive association of recipient or donor tlr <dig> snps with the incidence of ia in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation  <cit> . in human crs, there are also discrepancies between studies regarding the role of snps in tlr genes. park et al. reported an association between tlr <dig> snps in a korean population  <cit> , but tewfik et al. could not confirm these results in quebec  <cit> .

the effect of the environment on susceptibility to certain diseases is another important aspect that should be considered together with genetic background. vercelli  <cit>  reported that genes and environment are intertwined in complex nonlinear relationships. therefore, the same genetic background may result in the expression of different phenotypes when exposed to different environments. consequently, in a disease with a complex pathogenesis, the genotype of multiple contributing genes, together with environmental factors, may modify the likelihood of an individual developing the disease. in such instances, individual gene mutations are insufficient to cause the disease on their own  <cit> .

there are several limitations to the present study. firstly, although we cannot confirm an association between polymorphism in the tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes with sna, it is possible that because of the small size of the study population, a slight/weak but real contribution of tlr <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> snps has been missed. another potential limitation is the selection of control dogs. although efforts were made to exclude dogs with respiratory, inflammatory, immune-mediated, neoplastic or infectious diseases, the possibility cannot be excluded that these dogs might develop such disease later in life. nevertheless, to try to overcome this problem, we recruited only dogs older than 6 years. another limitation was the use of a candidate gene approach, which permits comparison of allele frequencies of snps in genes suspected to be involved in sna among dogs with the disease and others without , but this method precludes finding other genes of interest. genome-wide approaches would overcome this limitation, but the need for a large number of affected dogs and the high associated expense renders this difficult.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of the present study suggest that tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are not implicated in the pathogenesis of sna in dogs. however, these results are limited by the size of the study population. this does not rule out the possibility of innate immune defects contributing to the development of the disease. other tlr genes and/or other genes involved in mucosal immunity may be important and require further investigation.
