BACKGROUND
the evolution of gene families and tandem repeat regions has been a controversial issue in evolutionary genetics because most of the repeat regions do not follow the conventional divergent model. in this model, each duplicate acquires a new function and gradually separates. however, repeated genes often maintain their original functions and are more similar within species than among related species  <cit> .

two alternative models of evolution have been proposed to explain this nondivergent evolutionary pattern in repeated gene families: concerted and birth-and-death. in the concerted model, mutations that occur in one repeat spread to the other repeats by unequal crossover or gene conversion, maintaining homogeneity among the repeats. this results in a low level of diversity of repeats within a species, and the sequences of the repeats being more similar within a species than between species. in the birth-and-death model, new repeat genes diversify by silent nucleotide substitutions. some repeats are maintained and amplified for a long time under purifying selection, whereas others are deleted or become nonfunctional as a result of deleterious mutations, which can lead to a change in the number of copies between species. thus, there is a high level of diversity between repeats, and genes have a close interspecies pattern . in this study, we applied these models to improve our understanding of the evolution of the filaggrin gene , which contains coding tandem repeats and copy number variations between and within species. we investigated whether the repeat sequences of flg in primates have evolved according to the concerted or birth-and-death model.


flg encodes profilaggrin protein which is dephosphorylated and degraded to monomeric filaggrin repeats and then further proteolyzed to aminoacids. profilaggrin, filaggrin repeats and aminoacids are localized in the outer layers of the epidermis and have important functions in skin. glutamine is converted into pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid  and histidine is deiminated to cis-urocanic acid . pca and uca serve important functions as protecting against uv irradiation, maintaining the acidic ph, being involved in the local immune response, and maintaining overall homeostasis  <cit> . flg consists of three exons, with the repeat region being found on the third. the filaggrin repeat region consists of complete repeats that are flanked by two partial repeats . the complete repeats are responsible for the function of this protein in the skin. the number of complete repeats varies from  <dig> to  <dig> within human  individuals and populations. this copy number variation is associated with the quantity of filaggrin expressed in the epidermis . several nonsynonymous variants in the repeat region have also been reported to be associated with various dry skin disorders, particularly atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis vulgaris  <cit> .

comparative genomic studies have revealed that the structure of flg is similar in human, mouse , and dog . however, the number of complete repeats and the length of repeats differ between species  <cit> . these differences can be recognized as an example of structural variations resulting from species-specific duplication or loss events. structural variations are a major source of morphological differences, which may allow individuals to adapt to new environments and accelerate divergence between species . comparison of closely related species with short divergence times allows us to better understand the mechanisms leading to rapid divergence. in this study, we investigated variations in the repeat region of flg among five species of primates: crab-eating macaque , orangutan , gorilla , chimpanzee , and human and inferred whether the concerted model or the birth-and-death model best fits the evolutionary pathway for these complete tandem repeats.

RESULTS
flg sequences in primates

flg is localized on chromosome  <dig> of crab-eating macaque, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human. in human, it consists of three exons, with the repeat region being found on the third. neither exons other than exon  <dig> nor introns have filaggrin repeated units. the dna sequences of flg were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information  gene database  for the following primate species: h. sapiens , p. troglodytes , g. gorilla , p. abelii , and m. fascicularis . these were compared with the repeat region in human by carrying out a dot-matrix analysis using the harrplot program, and the matched sequences were then compared with individual partial and complete repeats of human flg. this allowed us to reconstruct the number and order of the repeats in these primate species.

the estimated number of complete repeats differed between species, as shown in fig.  <dig>  it has previously been reported that the length of these complete repeats ranges from  <dig> to 975 bp  <cit> . based on this, we noted that there were several gaps in some of the complete repeats in orangutan from the ncbi database, and one of the partial repeats was not identified in gorilla. furthermore, the complete repeats with gaps resulted in unframed repeats, which may produce truncated proteins . this finding implies that the sequences of flg for these primates that were obtained from the ncbi database are also likely to have been incomplete.fig.  <dig> partial and complete repeat sequences of flg in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and crab-eating macaque. left shows the repeat order of flg in these primates based on the sequences from the national center for biotechnology information database; the gorilla sequence had an unframed repeat at the end of the sequence, and the orangutan sequence had unframed repeats in the middle. right shows the repeat order of flg sequences acquired through the use of both pacbio rsii and miseq in this study. black = partial repeats, white = complete repeats, and gray = regions with gaps. the nucleotide length of each repeat is shown beneath each repeat. the number of repeats varies between species




sequencing of large and nearly identical repeated structures is a challenging task, and the presence of exonic copy number variation increases complexity of the sequence analysis  <cit> . therefore, to overcome these difficulties and determine the complete nucleotide sequences of flg, we combined two different sequencing platforms: pacbio rs ii and illumina miseq. the long reads  generated by pacbio rs ii were used to determine the overall structure of the repeat regions as an initial reference. to compensate for the high error rate of pacbio rs ii, reads generated by miseq were then mapped to the initial reference to determine error-corrected sequences of flg for each of the primates  <cit> . in the resulting sequences, there were no gaps in the complete repeats, and two partial repeats were retrieved for all species. the sequences we acquired altered the number of complete repeats to  <dig> repeats for human, chimpanzee, and gorilla,  <dig> repeats for orangutan, and  <dig> repeats for crab-eating macaque . in the subsequent analyses, each of the repeats was considered as an independent unit.

phylogenetic analysis of complete repeats across species
based on the results of the multiple sequence alignment for all of the repeats , we constructed phylogenetic trees using the maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum likelihood methods, with a cutoff value of 50% due to the high similarity of the repeats, as described in the methods section. crab-eating macaque was used as an out-group .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree reconstruction using all complete repeats in these primates and the following parameters: partial deletion option, tamura-nei model with gamma distribution and invariable sites, nearest-neighbor-interchange heuristic method,  <dig> bootstrap resampling, and a cutoff value of 50%. bootstrap values are shown at the beginning of each branch. crab-eating macaque was used as an outgroup. crab-eating macaque repeats and orangutan repeats grouped into their own clusters . by contrast, the gorilla repeats, chimpanzee repeats, and human repeats are scattered across the “gorilla/chimpanzee/human cluster.” we divided the “gorilla/chimpanzee/human cluster” into subclusters in accordance with the reconciled tree reconstruction shown in fig. 3





all three methods gave similar phylogenetic trees. all complete repeats in crab-eating macaque and orangutan grouped into their own clusters , whereas the complete repeats in gorilla, chimpanzee, and human scattered across species in a large cluster  . this large cluster contained nine subclusters of repeats among species. however, with the exception of subclusters “f” and “h”, their counterparts were not in order—for example, chimpanzee-repeat  <dig> gathered with human-repeat  <dig> . to further confirm the intra and inter species clustering in primates, we added repeats of mouse and dog and then constructed maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum likelihood methods, with a cutoff value of 50% and observed the same phylogeny .

the clusters of crab-eating macaque and orangutan repeats suggest that unique ancestral repeats were duplicated in these two primate species. the finding that human, chimpanzee, and gorilla repeats clustered together, but with limited conservation in the order of the repeat sequences, suggests that these three species share several ancestral repeats, and that random duplication and loss events occurred independently in each of the three species.

the main difference between the concerted and birth-and-death models of evolution is the high levels of intragenic nucleotide diversity that are only found in the latter . we calculated the total number of sites showing variation and the nucleotide diversity  between complete repeats of flg using the dnasp <dig> program, as described in the methods section. the estimated π for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and crab-eating macaque was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively . we then compared the π of flg with that of polyubiquitin genes and rdna genes, which are representative multigene families that have evolved under birth-and-death evolution and concerted evolution, respectively  <cit> . the π of flg was comparable with that of polyubiquitin genes  and much larger than those of rdna genes   <cit> . this suggests that flg repeats have evolved under the birth-and-death model.table  <dig> comparison of all repeat sequences of the filaggrin gene within five primate species


a ×  <dig> measures the percentage of purifying selection




selection within the repeats of each species
the driving force that maintains repeats in the birth-and-death model is selection. under purifying selection, the number of nonsynonymous variations in a gene is expected to be smaller than the number of synonymous variations. purifying selection can be measured by making pairwise comparisons  × 100), which indicate the percentage of synonymous mutations  <cit> .

we found that the average percentage of synonymous substitutions for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and crab-eating macaque was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively . although nucleotide substitutions were generally synonymous, we found  <dig> pairs of complete repeats within species with higher nonsynonymous variations: two pairs in human repeats , two pairs in chimpanzee repeats , and eight pairs in gorilla repeats . none of the pairs of repeats in crab-eating macaque and orangutan had ka/ks >  <dig> .

codons and branches under selection across species
in humans, it has been suggested that several amino acid substitutions of flg may have evolved under positive selection  <cit> . while homozygous null-mutations of flg are associated with a variety of skin disorders, individuals expressing heterozygous null-mutations show a less severe phenotype and could acquire immunity via the skin barrier. population-specific mutations have also been reported, which rules out genetic drift  <cit> . in this study, we detected high ka/ks ratios  in our within-species comparisons. therefore, we investigated whether similar variations in flg were also present in other primates by searching for signatures of positive selection in the complete repeats across species using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood  software  <cit> , as described in the methods section.

first, we carried out two site-based tests for each codon of the complete repeats, in which we compared models with positive selection and neutral/negative selection  vs m2a  models and m <dig>  vs m <dig> ). in both of these tests, the results supported the presence of positive selection for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of codons, respectively; in flg complete repeats .table  <dig> positively selected codons and branches of the filaggrin gene in five primate species

cthe branch-site test was used to detect positively selected codons on a specific branch




second, we investigated whether selective pressures differed between branches of the phylogenetic tree by a branch-based test. the result of this test was not significant, suggesting that each branch has not evolved independently, and that either all branches have evolved at the same rate or certain branches have evolved at similar rates .

third, we performed branch-site tests to detect signatures of positive selection at specific branches. since the phylogenetic analyses outlined previously showed that the complete repeats were grouped into three clusters , we searched for the positively selected codons in the main branches of these clusters. we identified positively selected codons in the branches of the orangutan cluster and gorilla/chimpanzee/human cluster , with the signature of positive selection identified at codon  <dig> in both of these branches. we used the repeat sequences aligned to human-repeat  <dig> when we performed the search for signatures of positive selection by maximum likelihood  software; therefore the positively selected codon refers to codon  <dig> in human-repeat  <dig>  the known functional domains of filaggrin are located in a linker region at amino acids 11– <dig> and a cleavage region for caspase- <dig> at amino acids 162– <dig> or 171– <dig>  <cit> . the positively selected amino acids identified in this study were not located in these domains . however, it is possible that the positively selected codons detected in this study are located in as-yet-unknown functional domains.

crab-eating macaque and orangutan have evolved under the birth-and-death model by recent gene duplication
under the birth-and-death model of evolution, multigene families are not only expected to have high levels of nucleotide variation but also an interspecies gene-clustering pattern in the phylogenetic analysis. we only found high nucleotide variation, purifying selection, and an interspecies repeat cluster in the complete repeats in gorilla, chimpanzee, and human. the other two species  had high nucleotide variation and purifying selection but an intraspecies repeat clusters.

intraspecies repeat clusters can occur if the repeats are under recent duplication. therefore, to further characterize the evolutionary process behind the intraspecies repeat clusters detected in crab-eating macaque and orangutan, we constructed reconciled and divergence trees , the parameters for which are described in the methods section. these two trees suggest that the original crab-eating macaque repeat duplicated  <dig> mya, and that each branch has undergone a series of five duplications in the past  <dig>  mya. by contrast, the original orangutan repeat separated  <dig> mya, and the current nine repeats were created by one divergence event and seven subsequent duplications during the last  <dig> mya .fig.  <dig> “reconciled” trees using complete repeats of flg in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and crab-eating macaque. a “reconciled” gene tree indicating duplication  and loss events  from the most common ancestor of these primates: the crab-eating macaque repeats duplicated  <dig> times, orangutan repeats duplicated  <dig> times, and gorilla/chimpanzee/human repeats duplicated  <dig> times, and in human, the counterpart to chimpanzee-repeat  <dig> was lost, while in chimpanzee, the counterparts to human-repeats  <dig> and  <dig> were lost, and in gorilla, the counterpart to human-repeat  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and chimpanzee-repeat  <dig> was lost. b “reconciled” species tree indicating duplication and loss events in each species from their most common ancestor: crab-eating macaque repeats duplicated  <dig> times, orangutan repeats duplicated  <dig> times, gorilla repeats duplicated  <dig> times, and chimpanzee repeats duplicated  <dig> times, while the most common ancestor between human and chimpanzee duplicated  <dig> times, and the most common ancestor between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla duplicated  <dig> times; and  <dig> repeat was lost in gorilla,  <dig> repeats were lost in chimpanzee, and  <dig> repeat was lost in human. the number of repeats found in each species is provided in parentheses

we also found that gorilla, chimpanzee, and human have their own duplication events. for example, the four repeats in gorilla  gathered within the gorilla/chimpanzee/human cluster in the phylogenetic tree . by combining the information about the subclusters from the phylogenetic tree with the duplication and loss events from the reconciled tree, we were able to infer the evolution of the complete repeats in each species. we named each of the subclusters from “a” to “i,” according to the order of the repeat sequences in human, for example, the subcluster containing the first repeat in human was defined as subcluster “a.” we found that the order of these subclusters was largely conserved between human and chimpanzee . in contrast, the order of the subclusters in gorilla differed from those of human and chimpanzee, suggesting specific duplications in this species . here we named chimpanzee-repeat  <dig> as “i”, this repeat did not cluster with any other repeats but the reconciled analysis showed that the counterpart of human was lost. these results suggest that during a period of divergence, each species has gone through independent duplication and loss events, which has led to the creation of a unique set of repeats and their own clusters.fig.  <dig> repeat order of gorilla, chimpanzee, and human flg repeats, as inferred by phylogenetic and “reconciled” tree. gorilla duplicated repeats “c,” “d,” and “g,” chimpanzee and human duplicated repeat “a,” and human duplicated repeat “b” are shown. in chimpanzee, the counterpart to human-repeats b- <dig> has been lost, while in human, the counterpart to chimpanzee-repeat “i” has been lost, and in chimpanzee, the counterparts to human and gorilla-repeat h have been lost. in gorilla, the counterpart to human and chimpanzee repeats b has been lost




repeat variation found in crab-eating macaque and chimpanzee
in human, the number of flg complete repeats varies from  <dig> to  <dig> within individuals and populations  <cit> . taking the variation described in human into consideration, we performed pcr of the repeated region for additional primate samples. gel electrophoresis result showed that the size in chimpanzee and macaque samples varied suggesting the possibility of repeat variation in these species as seen in human .

discussion
the repeat region of flg consists of nearly identical complete repeats. however, the number of complete repeats differs between species, as previously reported in mouse and dog  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that the dna sequences obtained from the ncbi database were not complete and contained several gaps. therefore, we performed re-sequencing at flg in four primate species using pacbio rsii and miseq and were able to resolve the gaps and determine the full length of the repeat sequences of flg in each species. this led to the detection of  <dig> repeats for human, chimpanzee, and gorilla,  <dig> repeats for orangutan, and  <dig> repeats for crab-eating macaque .

it has previously been reported that gene-associated tandem repeats act as an accelerator of evolution by generating variation in structure and functionality  <cit> . birth-and-death model has been used to explain multigene families evolution. under the birth-and-death model, duplicates vary by silent nucleotide variations, which, with enough divergence time, can lead to lineage-specific expansions. we detected this pattern of evolution in the repeats of crab-eating macaque and orangutan using both reconciled and divergence trees  and was corroborated by including the repeats of mouse and dog in the reconciled tree   <cit> . the clusters of species-specific repeats may reflect the high nucleotide diversity together with duplication and loss events in each species , which seems to fit the birth-and-death model  <cit> . the main driving force of the birth-and-death model are duplications maintain by selection, which we found evidence for in flg. macaque repeats had the lowest nucleotide variation, the highest purifying rate and interspecies gene-clustering pattern in phylogeny analyses, most likely due to the recent repeat duplication that we reported . high synonymous variation has previously been found in most genes under the birth-and-death model of evolution, including actin in flagellate protists  and the ubiquitin gene family  <cit> . under the birth-and-death model of evolution, duplication and loss events are not caused by gene conversion. gene conversion is an unlikely event for flg repeats because they are located in one exon, and there is no gene family. we examined several algorithms for detection of recombination events and could not identify any major recombination event   <cit> . in addition, we removed the putative recombinant regions and reconstructing the phylogenetic tree resulted in only a few changes to the topology, confirming the low possibility of gene conversion   <cit> . a similar finding has previously been reported for the nat gene family, in which there was no evidence of gene conversion following the combined use of phylogenetic analysis and fine-scale synteny mapping  <cit> . the birth-and-death model suggests but does not require the presence of pseudogenes. in the ncbi gene database we did not find any filaggrin pseudogenes that include repeats but there are two types of genes that are similar to the complete repeats of filaggrin; filaggrin- <dig> and filaggrin-like. filaggrin- <dig> repeats are shorter than complete filaggrin repeats  and we did not consider filaggrin- <dig> for further analysis. we found filaggrin and filaggrin-like repeats in crab-eating macaque evolved under a similar birth-and-death model with strong selective constrains and positively selected codons were not detected, that is further described in additional file 1: supplementary information .

several studies have demonstrated that copy number variations due to the duplication or loss of repeats are important in modulating molecular pathways. this includes morphological modifications in dog breeds and craniofacial or digit defects in humans, which have been shown to be due to variation in the length of developmental genes  <cit> ; an increased in the risk for schizophrenia; and several complex diseases in human caused by heterozygosity  <cit>  or dosage compensation  <cit> . additionally, in the case of new gene copies, duplicates under strong purifying selection at the protein level lead to functional divergence of new copies through a process of neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization  <cit> . flg encodes profilaggrin, a long polyprotein. profilaggrin is dephosphorylated and cleaved into filaggrin repeat units. in the outer layers of skin, the repeat units of filaggrin are degraded into free amino acids that are a major determinant of the natural moisturizing factor and maintain the skin overall homeostasis  <cit> . the amount of filaggrin-degraded aminoacids can be altered by flg loss-of function mutations and variation in the number of complete repeats. loss-of-function mutations strongly associate with atopic dermatitis. atopic dermatitis patients with null-mutations were reported to have decreased levels of pca and uca . the number of flg complete repeats varies from  <dig> to  <dig> within human. we found variation in the length of the repeated region within species such as chimpanzee and crab-eating macaque and suggest the possibility of repeat variation in these species as seen in human . in human, it was previously reported that the variation in repeats are due to duplicates of repeat  <dig> and  <dig>  we designed primers for a product from human-repeat  <dig> to human-repeat  <dig> and gel electrophoresis showing more clearly this variation . the variation in the number of repeats affects filaggrin degradation products. increased number of flg repeats associate with a decreased risk for atopic dermatitis  <cit> . therefore, random copy number variation in the flg repeats within individuals could affect filaggrin degradation products and its functions, and will allow them to adapt more readily to a new environment  <cit> . in human, the effect of repeat variation was explained as mentioned before; however similar skin disorder or the functional significance of the repeat variation within primates has not been reported. therefore, further studies are required to verify the functional significance of copy number variation of flg repeats in primates.

CONCLUSIONS
we concluded that the dna sequences obtained from the ncbi database were not complete and contained several gaps and re-sequenced them using pacbio rsii and miseq. this led to the detection of a different number of repeats for chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and crab-eating macaque. also we concluded that flg repeats evolved under the birth-and-death model, by showing species-specific clusters in crab-eating macaque and orangutan; high nucleotide diversity together with duplication and loss events in each species and the unlikeliness of gene conversion. we conclude that the copy number variation in the complete repeats of flg across primates is a consequence of species-specific expansions following a long period of divergence.
