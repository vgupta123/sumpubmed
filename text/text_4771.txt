BACKGROUND
most of the current disease candidate gene prioritization methods  <cit>  rely on functional annotations. however, the coverage of the gene functional annotations is a limiting factor. although more than  <dig>  human disease genes have been documented, most of them continue to be functionally uncharacterized. currently, only a fraction of the genome is annotated with pathways and phenotypes  <cit> . while two thirds of all the genes are annotated by at least one functional annotation, the remaining one third is yet to be annotated.

analysis of protein-protein interaction networks  is important for inferring the function of uncharacterized proteins. protein-protein interactions refer to the association among the protein molecules and the study of these associations from the perspective of biochemistry, signal transduction and biomolecular networks. recent biotechnological advances like the high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen facilitated building proteome-wide ppins or "interactome" maps in humans  <cit> . the shift in focus to systems biology in the post-genomic era has generated further interest in ppins and biological pathways. network-based analyses have been developed with a number of goals  <cit> , including protein function prediction  <cit> , identification of functional modules  <cit> , interaction prediction  <cit> , identification of disease candidate genes  <cit>  and drug targets  <cit> , and the study of network structure and evolution  <cit> . while there is a wealth of protein-disease relationships in the published literature and a number of ppin resources, relatively few studies have actually used ppin analyses for prioritizing disease genes. thus, making use of these networks in the context of disease is a relatively new challenge  <cit> . one of the earliest efforts  <cit>  uses a classifier based on several topological features, including degree , 1n index , 2n index , average distance to disease genes, and positive topology coefficient . xu et al., built a knn-based classifier with all disease genes from omim and concluded that hereditary disease genes from omim in the literature-curated protein-protein interaction network are characterized by a larger degree, a tendency to interact with other disease genes, more common neighbors, and quick communication to each other  <cit> . a more recent application, genes2networks  <cit> , identifies important genes based on a list of "seed" genes. it generates a z-score for each "intermediate" gene from a binomial proportions test to represent its specificity or significance to the "seed" genes. the former method, independent of known disease-related genes, is used for disease candidate gene identification, especially in cases where there is little or no prior knowledge about the disease. the latter application, on the other hand, uses a "seed" list as training to score the neighboring genes. it avoids bias toward highly connected "hub" genes, but the candidate gene is searched in a local network region, and the user has to provide the size of the neighborhood region in the network.

recent technological advances in genomic sequencing, gene expression analysis, and other massively parallel techniques, while opening new opportunities, continue to pose a formidable challenge in deriving meaningful information from the large data silos. typically, such data can be represented as networks in which the nodes  are linked by edges . structural analysis of these networks can lead to new insights into biological systems and is a helpful method for proposing new and testable hypotheses. biological networks have in fact been found to be comparable to communication and social networks  <cit> . for instance, ppins and communication networks share several common characters such as scale-freeness and small-world properties, suggesting that the algorithms used for social and web networks are equally applicable to biological networks. although ppis have been used widely to identify novel disease candidate genes  <cit> , besides kohler et al.  <cit>  and wu et al.  <cit> , there have been no reports on using ppis for disease gene prioritization. additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses social- and web- network analysis-based algorithms to prioritize disease candidate genes.

in the analysis of social networks, web graphs and telecommunication networks, a common question frequently asked is: which entities are most important in the network? although visualization-centered approaches such as graph drawing are useful to gain qualitative intuition about the structure, especially in small graphs, it is not practical to use these approaches for large and more complex networks. as an alternative, a number of other approaches have therefore been developed. for instance, a variety of measures  have been proposed by sociologists to determine the "centrality" of a node in a social network. likewise, in the area of web graphs, computer scientists have proposed and used several algorithms such as hits  <cit>  and pagerank  <cit>  for automatically determining the "importance" of web pages.

in the current study, for the first time, we utilize the above methods to prioritize disease candidate genes by estimating their relative importance in the ppin to the disease-related genes. specifically, we determine the optimal parameter values in the methods and record the corresponding performance. the first algorithm that we use is based on white and smyth's pagerank algorithm. white and smyth  <cit>  proposed a general framework and a set of algorithms under the framework to measure the relative importance in networks. the first method is an extension of the original pagerank algorithm and is called pagerank with priors. it mimics the random surfer model wherein a random internet surfer starts from one of a set of root nodes, r, and follows one of the links randomly in each step. in this process, the surfer jumps back to the root nodes at probability β, thus restarting the whole process. intuitively, the pagerank with priors algorithm generates a score that is proportional to the probability of reaching any node in the web surfing process. this score indicates or measures the relative "closeness" or importance to the root nodes. the second algorithm, named hits with priors, is an extension of hits , which is a link analysis algorithm developed by jon kleinberg to rate web pages. it determines two values for a page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages  <cit> . in the web surfing model, the surfer still starts from one of the root nodes. in the odd steps he/she can either follow a random "out-link" or jump back to a root node, and in the even steps he/she can instead follow an "in-link" or jump back to a root node. similar to the pagerank with priors, hits with priors also estimates the relative probability of reaching a node in the network. the third algorithm we use is the k-step markov method. in a similar web surfing scenario, this method mimics a surfer who starts with one of the root nodes. the surfer follows a random link in each step, but he/she return to the root node after k steps and restarts surfing.

RESULTS
human protein interaction network
the human protein-protein interactions were extracted from the ncbi entrez gene ftp site  <cit>  and contained  <dig> nodes or vertices  and  <dig> edges . this compilation is based on three interaction databases, namely, bind   <cit> , biogrid   <cit> , and hprd   <cit>  . although these literature-based or literature-curated interactions are more subjective to research bias, they are less prone to errors. analysis of this complete human protein interaction network using "networkanalyzer"  <cit>  in cytoscape  <cit>  revealed  <dig> connected components. the largest of these has  <dig> genes. the remaining  <dig> genes are separated into  <dig> smaller components or sub networks of size two to five nodes or genes. since majority of these smaller sub-networks contain only two genes, we reasoned that it might not be of interest to check the distribution of the disease genes among them.

evaluation of ppin for gene prioritization
we used the same training data, from our previous study  <cit> , comprising  <dig> diseases with  <dig> associated genes. of these,  <dig> genes were used in the cross validation because the remaining  <dig> genes do not have any known protein-protein interactions . the random training dataset, used as a control, was built with  <dig> random gene lists, with each list comprising 31– <dig> genes. we used three methods, namely, k-step markov , pagerank with priors , and hits with priors , to prioritize the disease gene with different parameter values. the random genes were prioritized using prankp with back probability set to  <dig> . the roc curves of representative cross validation results are shown in the figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

based on our results, we observed that in terms of performance, hitsp was similar to prankp under different back probability values. therefore, only prankp was tested for extreme back probability values such as  <dig>  and  <dig> . the  <dig> different test conditions  along with the auc values from each validation run are listed in table  <dig>  each of the methods, with the same parameter settings, was repeated  <dig> times. the performance values derived from each of the methods with respect to a particular parameter value are summarized in table  <dig>  the plots of auc with different parameter values are shown in figure  <dig>  the best performance of each method was selected, namely, prankp and hitsp with back probability  <dig>  and ksmarkov with k =  <dig>  for analysis of variance . the p value of  <dig>  suggests that there is no significant difference among the best performance of the three methods.

column "test type" indicates the method and parameter settings of the test. p <dig> through p <dig> stand for pagerank with priors with back probability  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively; k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> represent k-step markov with k =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  accordingly; h <dig> and h <dig> are hits with priors with back probability  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. there were  <dig> test conditions, each repeated  <dig> times.

highlighted rows correspond to the best parameter value of each method.

cardiac septal defect candidate gene prioritization
mining the "clinical synopsis" and "allelic variant sections" of ncbi's omim  database  <cit> , we extracted  <dig> omim records that had the terms "atrial septal defect" or "asd" or "ventricular septal defect" or "vsd" occurring in the text. there were  <dig> genes mapping to these records . these  <dig> genes were used as the training set. mining the human protein interactome  <cit>   we extracted the  <dig> immediate interactants  of these training  <dig> genes . we then sought to rank or prioritize these genes using both integrative functional annotation-based methods and ppin-based methods using our toppgene server  <cit> . there was an overlap of  <dig> genes which were removed leaving  <dig> genes for ranking. we call this as the test set for cardiac septal defect.

among the top  <dig> ranked genes ,  <dig> genes  were common to all the methods . analyzing the results we observed that the performance of both the approaches  was comparable. for instance, among the top  <dig> ranked genes using functional annotations,  <dig> genes were reported to be previously associated with cardiac development or malformation . six  of these top  <dig> have been previously reported to be associated with cardiac septal defects. in case of ppin-based methods, there were  <dig> genes previously associated with either cardiac development or abnormalities. of these,  <dig> genes  have been associated with cardiac septal defect. the genes ep <dig> and crebbp have been ranked 11/ <dig> and 15/ <dig> using ppin-based methods while the rankings were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively using toppgene. interestingly, truncated cbp protein  leads to classical rubinstein-taybi syndrome phenotypes in mice characterized by atrial and ventricular septal defects  <cit> . likewise, mouse embryos lacking p <dig> protein  show ventricular septal defects  <cit> . the higher ranking of ep <dig> and crebbp in ppin-based method is because of their direct interactions with training set gene . previous studies have reported that the paralogous genes ep <dig> and crebbp co-activate tfap2a in the presence of cited <dig>  <cit> . similarly, myl <dig> is ranked first in ppin-based prioritization while it is ranked  <dig> in functional annotation-based prioritization methods. the higher ranking in the former is because myl <dig> has only one known interactant , mutation of which is associated with cardiac septal defects  <cit> . another noteworthy example is bmp <dig>  ranked 6/ <dig> by ppin-based method while the toppgene rank was 32/ <dig>  on the other hand there were examples of potential candidate genes which the ppin-based prioritization methods ranked low while toppgene ranked them higher. for instance, erbb <dig> was ranked 112/ <dig> by ppin-based method while functional annotation-based gene prioritization  ranked it as eight. mice with a ventricular-restricted deletion of erbb <dig> show ventricular septal defect   <cit>  suggesting that the human ortholog erbb <dig> could be a potential candidate gene for vsd. thus, while integrative functional annotation-based methods are superior in prioritizing disease candidate genes, ppin-based methods certainly have their own advantages. we, therefore, hypothesize that a combined functional annotations- and ppin- based methods are more effective in identifying and ranking of disease candidate genes. the rankings of all the test  genes using different methods  are included in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  further, given the continued incomplete annotation coverage of human genes , ppin-based prioritization is a viable option.

the cardiac septal defect sub-network was created using known cardiac septal defect genes  and their immediate interactants, and was prioritized using functional annotation and ppin based methods. functional annotation based prioritization was done using toppgene server. the ppin based rankings were obtained using  <dig> methods: k step markov, hits with priors, and pagerank with priors. the highlighted genes are those occurring in all of the prioritized top  <dig> genes generated using different methodologies. note that the hits with priors and pagerank with priors gave identical results . the genes marked with * are associated with abnormal heart morphology  while those marked with # have been reported to be associated with cardiac septal defects .

about 1/3rd  genes of the interactome are sparsely annotated .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our current study, based on the observation that biological networks share many properties with web and social networks, is an attempt to extend the successful graph analysis-based algorithms from computer science research to tackle the disease gene prioritization problem. literature-based and manually curated protein interactions were used to form the base network, and extended versions of the pagerank algorithm and hits algorithm, as well as the k-step markov method, were applied to prioritize disease candidate genes in a training-test schema. for each prioritization, a list of known disease-related genes was used as a training set , and the genes in the test list  were ranked. to evaluate and compare the performance of the methods, a large-scale cross validation was performed. a total of  <dig> conditions with three algorithms and different parameter settings were tested, each repeated five times. rank-based roc curves were plotted, and auc values were used to quantitatively measure the performance.

based on our results, we draw the following conclusions: first, under appropriate settings, for example, a back probability of  <dig>  for pagerank with priors and hits with priors, and walk length  <dig> for k-step markov method, the three methods achieved the same auc value and hence similar performance. this suggests that based on the current knowledge of protein-protein interaction networks, even other similar or related methods  under the same framework might yield similar results.

second, the value of back probability in pagerank with priors and hits with priors can be of broad range  and still result in relatively stable performance. however, when the back probability was set to very low , the performance dropped significantly. this is expected because in both the methods , as the back probability reaches  <dig>  the bias toward the "seeds" is eliminated. pagerank/hits with priors are same as the original pagerank/hits algorithm; therefore, the prioritization toward the selected "seeds" fails. the performance of the k-step markov method, on the other hand, decreased significantly when the length of random walk k was small . under this condition, the k-step markov method calculates the probability to spend time on each protein from the seeds with a random walk of length  <dig>  the proteins that are not directly interacting with "seeds" will therefore never be reached and scored  <dig>  this suggests that if a true disease candidate gene is not directly interacting with the "seeds", it will be ignored when k is  <dig>  the method converged to the best performance when k was  <dig>  any further increase in the random walk length did not improve the performance. this can be attributed to the fact that the average shortest path length in the ppin was only about  <dig> .

third, the overall performance of candidate gene prioritizations based exclusively on protein networks is comparable to functional annotation-based methods  <cit>  since they were all tested using the same cross validation. the auc value of functional annotation based method, toppgene  <cit> , was  <dig> , and the best auc value of network-based methods  was  <dig> . this shows that network-based methods are generally not as effective as the integrated functional annotation-based methods for disease candidate gene prioritization. for a more accurate comparison, we compared ppin-based methods to the individual functional annotation features used in our previous study  <cit> . surprisingly, we found that network-based methods are better than all annotations . we therefore conclude that ppins can be a potentially good feature for disease candidate gene prioritization irrespective of whether the genes have other functional annotations or not. based on our findings that in one-to-one comparison ppin-based candidate gene prioritization performed better than all other gene features or annotations, we hypothesize that ppins can be a potentially good feature for disease candidate gene prioritization, especially when the genes lack all other functional annotations or are sparsely annotated

network-based prioritization methods, however, have certain limitations. just like functional annotation-based methods, the performance depends on the quality of interaction data. it is an acknowledged fact that the current human protein interactome suffers with incompleteness and unreliability with missing interactions and false positives. to make reliable candidate gene prioritization – based either on functional annotations or ppins – we must have reasonably complete datasets that accurately represent the interactions and annotations in the genome and proteome. however, as the quality of these annotations and interactions improves the confidence in candidate gene prioritization approaches based on them will also improve. certainly, our approach can be improved methodology-wise in the following directions. first, the algorithms used in our current study were originally developed to identify "important" nodes in networks. although we used extended versions of these algorithms to prioritize nodes to selected "seeds," there still could be a bias toward hubs. additionally, since these approaches were designed for web and general networks, there is definitely scope for additional modifications to make them fit better with biological networks  or edges ). as future extension, apart from considering weighted nodes and edges, we plan to integrate our method with other methods . it is expected that using both functional annotations and ppin-based topological parameters may better facilitate the discovery and prioritization of disease genes.
