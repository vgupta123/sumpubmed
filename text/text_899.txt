BACKGROUND
proteins destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are labeled with ubiquitin chains through the action of an enzymatic cascade consisting of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme , a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme , and a ubiquitin-ligase   <cit> . downstream of ubiquitylation, ubiquitin-receptors recognize the poly-ubiquitylated proteins and facilitate their degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . some ubiquitin-receptors, such as psmd <dig>  and rpn <dig>  are intrinsic to the regulatory particle of the proteasome  <cit> . others, such as those from the rad <dig> or ubiquilin families, shuttle on and off the proteasome  <cit> . in addition to the single subunit receptors mentioned above, a distinct class of ubiquitin-receptors endowed with atpase activity has at its core p <dig> hexamers. it has been proposed that p <dig> functions as a 'segregase' by converting the atp-derived energy into mechanical force  <cit> . indeed, p <dig> complexes can separate their substrates from cellular structures, such as the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane  <cit> , or from protein partners  <cit> . the p <dig> protein itself has little affinity for ubiquitin and relies on its interaction with ubiquitin-binding adaptors to function as a ubiquitin-receptor. such adaptors include the npl4/ufd <dig> dimer  <cit>  and the uba-ubx proteins  <cit> . the latter employ their ubx domain to interact with the n-terminus of p <dig> and the uba  domain to bind ubiquitylated proteins  <cit> . humans express five uba-ubx proteins: ubxn <dig>  faf <dig>  faf <dig>  ubxn <dig>  and p <dig>  a striking observation from the mass spectrometry analysis of uba-ubx protein immunoprecipitates is their ability to interact with a large number of e <dig> ubiquitin-ligases  <cit> . these include components of cullin-ring e <dig> ligase  complexes and also single subunit ring- and hect-domain e3s.

similar to ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-like  protein nedd <dig> is attached to its substrates by specific e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> enzymes. to date, cullins represent the major class of proteins that are targets for neddylation  <cit> . the nedd <dig> e <dig> activity in this case is provided by the dual action of dcn <dig>  <cit>  and the ring subunit of the crl complex  <cit> . it has been known for over a decade that cullin-neddylation is essential for the e <dig> activity of crl complexes  <cit> . recent structural and biochemical studies elucidated the complex molecular mechanism underlying crl activation by the nedd <dig> modification. neddylation induces a major conformational change in the cullin that essentially allows the ring domain of rbx <dig> to spring free from the cullin. it is this increased flexibility of the ring-domain that ultimately translates into superior ubiquitin-ligase activity of crls  <cit> .

we have previously identified hif1α as a novel substrate of p <dig>  with the uba-ubx protein ubxn <dig> serving as the substrate-binding adaptor  <cit> . hif1α heterodimerizes with hif1β to form the hif <dig> transcription factor that is essential during hypoxia for triggering the expression of specific proteins required to counteract the hypoxic stress  <cit> . hif1α is continuously expressed during normoxia and is actively targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through the action of a cul2-based crl complex . within crl <dig>  cul <dig> acts as a scaffold to which the ring subunit  and the elongin b/elongin c dimer bind. vhl docks on elongin c and directly interacts with hif1α  <cit> , acting as a substrate-binding adaptor for the crl <dig> complex . consistent with p <dig> having a positive role in hif1α degradation, hif1α accumulates upon p <dig> depletion by sirna. paradoxically, ubxn <dig> depletion results in reduced levels of hif1α, indicating that ubxn <dig> involvement in hif1α degradation is more complex than anticipated  <cit> .

here we show that ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins is not mediated by its ubiquitylated substrates, but involves the direct docking of the uim motif in ubxn <dig> onto the neddylated cullins. ubxn <dig> over-expression causes non-ubiquitylated hif1α to accumulate in a manner that is dependent on an intact uim motif in ubxd <dig>  our data suggest that ubxn <dig> may act as a negative regulator of crl <dig> and this would favor subsequent recruitment of p <dig> 

RESULTS
active ubiquitylation is not necessary for ubxn <dig> interaction with cul2
among human uba-ubx proteins, ubxn <dig> is the most proficient in interacting with crl subunits. indeed, its ability to interact with cul <dig> greatly outshines other uba-ubx proteins  <cit> . we therefore set out to further explore ubxn <dig> interaction with crl <dig>  our initial assumption was that the interaction of uba-ubx proteins with e <dig> ubiquitin-ligases was indirect, mediated by their ubiquitylated substrates. to test this hypothesis we used the a31n-ts <dig> cells, which are mouse embryo fibroblasts thermosensitive for the ubiquitin-e <dig>  <cit> . when these cells are grown at the non-permissive temperature, the initial step in the protein-ubiquitylation cascade is blocked leading to a dramatic reduction in the levels of ubiquitylated proteins compared to control cells grown at 35°c . as an added proof that the ubiquitylation pathway was defective, we observed hif1α accumulation in the cells grown at 39°c. although ubiquitin-binding to flag-ubxn <dig> was drastically reduced, ubxn <dig> interaction with cul <dig> was unaffected .

ubxn <dig> stably interacts with the core crl <dig> complex
next we examined ubxn <dig> interaction with other components of the crl <dig> complex. flag-ubxn <dig> effectively co-immunoprecipitated cul <dig>  elongin c and rbx <dig>  which constitute the core crl <dig> complex. in contrast, ubxn <dig> interaction with vhl and hif1α could only be observed upon brief inhibition of the proteasome with mg <dig> . similar results were obtained when endogenous ubxn <dig> was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies .

the data presented thus far indicated that ubxn <dig> binding to cul <dig> was not mediated by its interaction with ubiquitylated-proteins that are crl <dig> substrates. this raised the interesting hypothesis that ubxn <dig> might interact directly with the crl <dig> core complex, irrespective of whether it is charged with a substrate .

cullin-neddylation is required for the interaction with ubxn7
we observed that ubxn <dig> interacted preferentially with the neddylated form of cul <dig>  which was largely depleted from the extracts after flag-ubxn <dig> immunoprecipitation . we also noticed that flag-ubxn <dig> over-expression causes an up-shift of cul <dig> to a slower migrating form . to confirm that this is indeed neddylated-cul <dig>  we used a chemical inhibitor of the nedd8-e <dig>  mln <dig>  <cit> . mln <dig> abolished cullin-neddylation and also the cul <dig> up-shift caused by ubxn <dig> over-expression . to investigate the possibility that cullin-neddylation is required for the interaction with ubxn <dig>  we created two neddylation-defective cul <dig> mutants, k689r and k719r. lys <dig> is the site of nedd8-conjugation in human cul <dig> and mutating this residue to arginine abolishes neddylation  <cit> . lys <dig> is a conserved residue among cullins and its equivalent in yeast cdc <dig> is part of the interaction surface with dcn <dig>  <cit>  . cul2-neddylation was largely defective in the k719r mutant , presumably due to its inability to interact with the dcn <dig> component of the nedd8-e <dig>  we attempted to test whether this mutant was defective in binding the human dcn1-like protein, but dcnl <dig> was undetectable even in wild-type flag-cul <dig> immunoprecipitates. none of the above mutations affected cul <dig> interaction with rbx <dig> . strikingly, there was a precise correlation between cul2-neddylation and its ability to interact with endogenous ubxn <dig>  ubxn <dig> binding was completely abolished in the k689r mutant and strongly reduced in the k719r mutant . thus, neddylation was required for cul <dig> interaction with ubxn <dig>  this is a common feature among cullins, because mln <dig> treatment prevented not only ubxn <dig> interaction with cul <dig>  but also with cul <dig>  cul <dig> and cul4a . the defect in cullin-binding caused by mln <dig> treatment could not be rescued by simultaneous treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> . in contrast, mln <dig> treatment did not affect ubxn <dig> interaction with ubiquitylated-proteins or with p <dig> .

the uim motif of ubxn <dig> is required to engage the nedd <dig> modification on cullins
because ubxn <dig> preferentially interacted with neddylated-cul <dig> and cullin-neddylation was a prerequisite for the interaction to occur, we became intrigued with the possibility that the nedd <dig> modification on cullins might be directly involved in recruiting ubxn <dig>  we therefore turned our attention to ubxn <dig> and the various domains that are part of its structure. at the n-terminus of ubxn <dig> there is a uba domain, followed by a uas domain of unknown function, a uim motif and a ubx domain at the c-terminus . to investigate whether any of these domains was required for ubxn <dig> interaction with cul <dig>  we compared the ubiquitin- and cul2-binding capability of several ubxn <dig> variants, including wild-type, a point mutant in the ubx domain , and truncation mutants lacking either the uba, the uas, the uim or the ubx domain . the deletion of the uas domain had largely no effect on ubxn <dig> interaction with ubiquitin, p <dig> or cul <dig>  both Δuba and Δuim truncation mutants were partially defective in ubiquitin-binding . interestingly, while Δuba had wild-type capability to bind cul <dig> , the Δuim truncation caused a pronounced reduction in cul2-binding . these results suggested that the uim motif was required for cul2-binding, while the uba domain was not.

as expected, both ubx-deletion and a point mutation in this domain  abolished p <dig> binding . surprisingly, these mutations also affected ubiquitin-binding, suggesting that they have a broad effect on ubxn <dig> function, possibly by altering the overall structure of the protein. although ubx mutants were severely defective in p97- and ubiquitin-binding, they largely retained their ability to interact with cul <dig> , supporting the notion that ubxn <dig> binding to cul <dig> is independent of its binding to p <dig> or ubiquitylated-proteins.

consistent with the reduced binding of ubxn <dig> Δuim to cul <dig>  over-expression of this mutant failed to cause an up-shift of cul <dig> to the neddylated form . in effect, cul <dig> migration in cells expressing ubxn <dig> Δuim was similar to untransfected cells .

various residues within the uim motif are essential for its interaction with ubiquitin  <cit> . we found that mutating ser <dig> to either ala or his causes a defect in binding neddylated-cul <dig> similar to uim deletion . we therefore conclude that both uim-deletion and point mutations in this motif negatively affect ubxn <dig> interaction with neddylated-cullin.

to further substantiate the ability of the uim motif in ubxn <dig> to interact with nedd <dig> rather than ubiquitin we performed in vitro binding assays to nedd8- or ubiquitin-agarose. wild-type ubxn <dig> was pulled-down efficiently with both types of beads . deletion of the uim motif caused a marked reduction in nedd8-binding and had no effect on ubiquitin-binding, while uba-deletion abolished ubiquitin-binding and caused some reduction in nedd8-binding as well. these data strongly support the notion that the uim motif of ubxn <dig> is specialized in recognizing nedd <dig> and can directly engage the nedd <dig> modification on cullins.

ubxn <dig> interacts with cullin-ring complexes in vitro
to check whether ubxn <dig> could interact with cullin complexes in vitro, we used anti-flag beads to immunoprecipitate flag-tagged ubxn <dig> incubated with either unmodified cul <dig> or cul <dig> that was in vitro neddylated. only a fraction of cul <dig> became neddylated, because rbx <dig> was present in substoichiometric amounts in our cul <dig> preparation. we found that wild-type ubxn <dig> could interact efficiently with cul <dig> irrespective of its neddylation status . a ubxn <dig> variant lacking the uim motif was equally proficient in interacting with both forms of cul <dig> . under these conditions ubxn <dig> interaction with cul <dig> does not appear to depend strictly on either uim or nedd <dig>  to eliminate potential binding sites in the n-terminal half of the cullin, we then used bacterially expressed gst-rbx <dig> in complex with the c-terminal fragment of cul <dig>   <cit> . the cul1/rbx <dig> complex immobilized on glutathione-beads was either neddylated or exposed to a mock neddylation-mix without nedd <dig>  all ubxn <dig> variants tested interacted to some degree with the non-neddylated cul <dig> fragment . upon cul1-neddylation, the interaction with wild-type ubxn <dig> and also with the Δuba mutant was enhanced, while the interaction with the Δuim mutant remained unaffected . we therefore established that ubxn <dig> can directly interact with cullins in vitro and confirmed that the uim-nedd <dig> contact has a contribution, albeit not as important as observed using cell extracts.

ubxn <dig> over-expression causes hif1α accumulation in a uim-dependent manner
because various ubxn <dig> mutants had altered ability to interact with ubiquitylated-proteins or with cul <dig>  we checked whether their expression in the cell might have any consequence on the levels of hif1α, which is a crl <dig> substrate  <cit>  and also interacts with ubxn <dig>  <cit> . over-expression of wild-type ubxn <dig> caused a significant accumulation of hif1α in its non-ubiquitylated form . most importantly, this effect was dependent on the uim motif, as hif1α levels in cells over-expressing a uim-deleted version of ubxn <dig> were similar to untransfected cells . in contrast, the levels of the crl <dig> subunits cul <dig>  vhl, elongin c and rbx <dig> remained unaffected . ubxn <dig> is unique in its ability to cause uim-dependent accumulation of hif1α, as over-expression of another uim-containing ubiquitin-receptor, the proteasome subunit psmd <dig>  had no effect on hif1α levels .

to facilitate hif1α detection, for the experiments shown in figures 5a and 5b, the cells were subjected to brief inhibition of the proteasome activity prior to cell lysis. however, uim-dependent accumulation of hif1α upon ubxn <dig> over-expression could also be observed in the absence of mg <dig> treatment . point mutations at ser <dig> in the uim motif that negatively affect cul2-binding  also abolished hif1α accumulation, similar to uim-deletion .

previous reports identified a phosphorylation site within the uim motif of human ubxn <dig> at ser <dig>  <cit> . we therefore created a phosphorylation-defective  and a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant  of that residue to verify whether phosphorylation of ser <dig> might regulate uim function. both mutants behaved similar to wild-type with respect to cul2- and hif1α-binding . they also caused hif1α accumulation, much like wild-type ubxn <dig> . therefore, phosphorylation at ser <dig> does not appear to be critical for uim function.

interestingly, the defect in cul2-binding observed for the uim-defective mutants correlated with a complete loss of binding to non- or oligo-ubiquitylated hif1α . nonetheless, these mutants retained the ability to interact with poly-ubiquitylated hif1α , presumably via the uba domain.

long ubiquitin-chains on hif1α cause reduced ubiquitin-receptor selectivity
we previously observed that hif1α carrying long ubiquitin-chains can interact, albeit inefficiently, with uba-ubx proteins other than ubxn <dig>  <cit> . consistent with it being pre-docked on the crl <dig> complex, ubxn <dig> interacted with hif1α at various degrees of ubiquitylation, from non- or oligo-ubiquitylated to poly-ubiquitylated . in contrast, another uba-uas-ubx protein, faf <dig>  only interacted with slower migrating hif1α , similar to ubxn <dig> lacking the uim motif .

flag-ubxn <dig> was found exclusively in the nuclei of hela cells . rad23b, another uba-domain ubiquitin-receptor also localizes to the nuclear compartment  <cit>  and this prompted us to check whether it may also interact with hif1α. like faf <dig>  rad23b was able to co-immunoprecipitate hif1α carrying longer ubiquitin-chains . hence, as the ubiquitin-chains get longer, the substrate appears less selective in its interaction with ubiquitin-receptors. our observations suggest that ubxn <dig> targets mainly the nuclear pool of hif1α and it may compete with rad23b for ubiquitylated-hif1α in the nucleus.

discussion
ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins requires neddylation and is independent of the ubiquitylated substrate
multiple lines of evidence indicate that ubiquitin/substrate-binding and cullin-binding to ubxn <dig> are two independent events:  inhibition of the ubiquitin-e <dig> strongly reduces ubiquitin-binding, but it has no effect on cul2-binding to ubxn7;  ubxn <dig> interaction with hif1α/vhl is transient and strongly enhanced upon proteasome inhibition while ubxn <dig> interaction with the core crl <dig> complex is stable;  uba-domain deletion reduces ubiquitin-binding to ubxn <dig>  but it does not affect the interaction with cul <dig> 

furthermore, several observations support the notion that neddylation is necessary for ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins:  cul <dig> mutants defective to varying degrees in getting neddylated are similarly defective in ubxn <dig> binding;  chemical inhibition of the nedd8-e <dig> abolishes the interaction of ubxn <dig> with multiple cullins;  in vitro neddylation of a cul1-fragment stimulates its interaction with bacterially-expressed ubxn <dig>  in a uim-dependent manner. in vitro, ubxn <dig> can interact with non-neddylated cullins suggesting that uim-nedd <dig> may not be the only link between ubxn <dig> and crls. as we used simplified crls containing only the cullin and rbx <dig>  these other binding determinants might be particularly accessible, thereby relinquishing the strict requirement for neddylation that we observed for the native form of cul <dig> present in cell extracts.

ubxn <dig>  one domain for each interaction
the ubx domain has a ubiquitin-like structure  <cit>  and is widely used by p <dig> co-factors to interact with p <dig> n-termini  <cit> . our analysis confirms that the ubx domain is the only domain of ubxn <dig> required for p <dig> binding.

both uba and uim have been characterized extensively as ubiquitin-binding modules  <cit> . nedd <dig> and ubiquitin sequences are 57% identical resulting in a very similar three-dimensional fold, termed the ubiquitin superfold. most importantly, the hydrophobic surface of ubiquitin  that interacts with ubiquitin-binding domains such as uba  <cit>  and uim  <cit>  is conserved in nedd <dig>  <cit> . uba and uim interact with nedd <dig> in vitro  <cit>  and also with another domain from the ubiquitin superfold family, the ubl domain  <cit> . in principle, either uba or uim could serve as a docking site for neddylated-cullins.

we show that within ubxn <dig>  uba and uim play distinct roles. in cell extracts, the ubxn <dig> mutant lacking the uba domain is fully competent in interacting with cullins, thus ruling out the involvement of this domain in cullin-binding. this mutant is the least competent in ubiquitin-binding, but it is not fully defective. it is possible that, in this case, ubiquitin-binding is not direct, but mediated by the uim motif bound to cullins. in contrast, ubxn <dig> lacking the uim motif or carrying point mutations therein is strongly defective in cullin-binding. the residual cul2-binding observed for the Δuim mutant may be mediated by its uba-dependent interaction with ubiquitylated substrates of crl <dig>  indeed this mutant retains the ability to interact with hif1α carrying long ubiquitin-chains. we argue that the uim motif contributes to the direct binding of ubxn <dig> to neddylated-cullins. this conclusion is strongly supported by our in vitro binding assays where a ubxn <dig> variant lacking the uim motif becomes defective in binding to nedd8- but not ubiquitin-agarose. this experiment also clarifies that the uim motif recognizes the nedd <dig> modification per se rather than the neddylated conformation of cullins.

the data presented here suggest that each of the three domains found in ubxn <dig> enables a specific interaction to occur. thus, the uim motif allows docking of ubxn <dig> on neddylated-cullins, the uba domain is required for binding ubiquitylated-protein substrates, and the ubx domain recruits the p <dig> complex . future work will reveal the role played by the uas domain.

processivity versus selectivity in crl-dependent degradation
having established that ubxn <dig> can directly interact with neddylated crl complexes, a key question is whether this interaction might have any effect on the ubiquitin-ligase activity of crls.

the data presented here lead us to speculate that ubxn <dig> is not only a ubiquitin-binding adaptor for p <dig>  but it may also embody a novel mechanism of crl inhibition. this would be in agreement with our previous observation that ubxn <dig> depletion by sirna causes a reduction in hif1α levels and not hif1α accumulation as would be expected were it simply mediating hif1α interaction with p <dig>  <cit> .

our finding that ubxn <dig> over-expression causes the accumulation of hif1α mostly in its non-ubiquitylated form suggests that the uim-nedd <dig> interaction would have a negative effect on ubiquitin-chain elongation, that is, reduce the processivity of the crl ubiquitin-ligase. ubxn <dig> over-expression causes not only hif1α accumulation, but also converts cul <dig> to its neddylated form. because both effects are entirely dependent on the uim motif, it is tempting to propose that by sequestering cul <dig> in its neddylated form, ubxn <dig> might sterically hinder the transition of the crl complex to an open conformation and thereby mitigate the positive effect nedd <dig> has on crl e <dig> activity.

we find that ubiquitin-receptor selectivity is compromised when hif1α carries long ubiquitin-chains. hence, we suggest that reduced crl processivity would favor p <dig> recruitment to the ubx-domain of ubxn <dig> rather than recruitment of alternative ubiquitin-receptors to a fast-growing ubiquitin chain. through its prior docking on the neddylated-crl, ubxn <dig> would be ideally poised to modulate substrate-ubiquitylation and to shift the balance towards p <dig> recruitment.

ubxn <dig> recruits p <dig> to nuclear hif1α
employing p <dig> complexes as the ubiquitin-receptor of choice is particularly important in the nucleus, where hif1α forms complexes with hif1β and associates with the promoters of its target genes  <cit> . among the various ubiquitin-receptors, p <dig> uniquely provides the segregase activity required to release nuclear hif1α from its protein partners and/or from chromatin prior to its degradation. endogenous hif1α is found in the nuclei of normoxic cells from normal and tumor tissues  <cit>  and poly-ubiquitylated hif1α is detected exclusively in the nuclei of normoxic hela cells  <cit> . consistent with the notion that ubxn7/p <dig> targets specifically nuclear hif1α, we find that flag-ubxn <dig> localizes to the nucleus of normoxic hela cells.

CONCLUSIONS
herein we show that among the ubiquitin-binding adaptors of p <dig>  ubxn <dig> has the unique ability to directly dock onto neddylated cullins. this function depends on the uim motif that is only found in the ubxn <dig> co-factor of p <dig>  furthermore, ubxn <dig> interaction with neddylated cul <dig> appears to negatively affect its ubiquitin-ligase activity as ubxn <dig> over-expression causes the accumulation of non-ubiquitylated hif1α in a uim-dependent manner.

it has been puzzling why p <dig> has such a multitude of ubiquitin-binding co-factors, for example, npl <dig>  ufd <dig>  various uba-ubx proteins, plaa. our data indicate that the role of ubxn <dig> as a substrate-binding adaptor for p <dig> is secondary to its ability to interact with crls and possibly to modulate their activity. ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins does not require p <dig>  while ubxn <dig> interaction with npl4/ufd <dig> is mediated by p <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that ubxn <dig> acts upstream of npl4/ufd <dig> in the p <dig> pathway of ubiquitin-dependent degradation. it is feasible to assume that various adaptors of p <dig> function in a sort of relay and their temporal succession is dictated by functions other than mere ubiquitin recognition. future work will tell for how many of the above proteins their ubiquitin-binding capacity is just one facet of a more complex function.
