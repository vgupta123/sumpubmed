BACKGROUND
definition of disorder
over the last decades, the field of structural biology has gained awareness of the importance of disordered regions or even fully unstructured proteins that participate in biological processes  <cit> , culminating in a boom of protein disorder predictor development during the last few years  <cit> . but even with the growing evidence of the importance of protein disorder in biological events, the precise definition of disorder remains unclear, mainly due to methodological limitations in its detection  <cit> . often, disordered segments are called low complexity regions, due to their high propensity for certain amino acid types. although polar low complexity regions are typically associated with being disordered, the reciprocal is not true. segments of proteins can be detected as disordered , without necessarily having the characteristics of a low complexity region  <cit> .

currently, there is a diverse nomenclature to express similar observations of disorder, such as intrinsically disordered proteins , also known as natively disordered, natively unfolded or intrinsically unstructured proteins   <cit> , just to name a few. whether these terms are used to describe full-length sequences is another issue, as frequently, due to technical limitations, structural evidence is available only for individual domains. typically, only particular regions of proteins are associated with disorder. some of these regions may participate in processes where transitions between different conformational states occur, as described in the trinity  <cit>  or quartet models  <cit> .

consequently, large multi-domain proteins are rarely described structurally as a whole. one well characterized example is the human dna-repair protein hhr23a , which contains  <dig> defined structural domains  interconnected through highly flexible  linker regions  <cit> . identification of such flexible linkers is of special importance for eukaryotic proteins that are often built up of multiple domains.

disorder vs. low complexity in protein function prediction
the correct identification of protein function in proteomics studies is often a long and tedious effort that requires the usage of several algorithms and predictors on a single sequence in order to converge to a putative function  <cit> . for example in the annie  <cit>  semi-automated pipeline for protein sequence annotation, as a first step, sequences are filtered out for low complexity regions, as they tend to produce a higher number of false positive hits in sequence similarity searches. these compositionally biased regions, often enriched in specific amino acid types, are regularly associated with disorder, and consequently receive less attention, as globular domains are quite well established, easier to characterize and promptly become the centre of attention for function determination.

however, in recent years, disorder has gained the awareness of the protein community as a necessary state for certain groups of proteins to correctly function  <cit> . in this way, it is not surprising that proteins previously described as denatured are gaining importance among functional proteins, as their disordered nature starts to be associated with biological processes. from the view point of function, disordered regions play a role as mechanical linkers, as flexible segments for entering binding clefts of globular domains, as translocation signals and as regions carrying sites for posttranslational modifications  <cit> . moreover, several recent papers discuss a wide range of additional functional roles of disordered regions  <cit> .

an ideal benchmark set
every newly developed predictor is assessed through either cross-validation tests, or direct comparison to other available predictors in benchmarking studies. in either case, having a good and well annotated dataset is a must that is independent of the evaluation means. misleading annotations can bias the final outcome and, consequently, the judgment of which predictor performs better than another.

to avoid that the evaluation of the predictors could be biased by fully relying on a few available datasets created by the author's predictors, we merged and extended the existing disorder information compiled in the disprot database  <cit> , into one general benchmark dataset, named sl, to include short and long disorder, as well as order information. the sl dataset is, so far, the most complete dataset that accounts for disordered regions of different lengths, as well as regions of missing coordinates annotated as remark  <dig> in pdb  <cit>  structures. the addition of order annotation in the sl dataset, based on the availability of structural domains in the pdb, has more than doubled the number of annotated residues from  <dig> to  <dig>  in this way, the sl dataset can be used as a good reference when benchmarking any disorder predictor. for comparison purposes, we also generated a dataset where disorder annotation is based solely on the information of missing coordinates in the pdb annotated as remark  <dig>  these residues can additionally be annotated as remark  <dig> for a few other reasons not limited to their disorder condition, including system-dependent proteolysis, damage of residues through x-ray incidence and incomplete fourier series. however, these scenarios are expected to be rare and we additionally avoid most of the above biases by requiring a minimum length of  <dig> for our remark  <dig> disorder annotation.

frequently, varying definitions of disorder are adopted by different groups upon development of a new predictor. disembl  <cit>  is an example of a method that includes three predictors trained to detect three definitions of disorder. choosing one definition over another constitutes a compromise when analyzing such disordered sequences. many predictors have been developed as small variations of general methodologies, such as neural networks  <cit> , or sequence profile scoring functions encoding mostly local amino acid composition-based descriptors  <cit> . in this study, we limited ourselves to evaluating a selection of locally downloadable predictors  <cit>  based on distinct methodologies summarized in table  <dig>  by using the sl dataset, we were able to obtain parameters to compare different methods at the same level of specificity, regardless of an a priori disorder definition and evaluate how the methods perform when combined together. these parameter sets are now implemented in our in-house sequence annotation pipeline annotator and its public www server version annie  <cit> .

RESULTS
comparing the two benchmark datasets
having a good quality gold standard benchmark dataset is essential when evaluating any predictor. by far, the most complete database of disordered protein segments is provided by disprot  <cit> , the release  <dig>  of which was available at the start of this work. at the same time, disprot should not be directly used as a benchmarking set, since the amount of residues annotated as ordered  is by an order of magnitude lower than the number of residues  with disorder annotation .

therefore, we generated two new datasets, named remark  <dig> and sl, which stands for short and long disorder, as described in the method section. the percentage of residues in each dataset is displayed in table  <dig>  as a service for the community, both datasets can be downloaded from http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sequences/disorder/ and as electronic supplement of this paper . in brief, we tried to match the protein sequences in disprot r <dig>  with sequences of known structures and found  <dig> entries in disprot r <dig>  that match at least one entry in the protein structure database  <cit> . our remark  <dig> dataset comprises these  <dig> sequences where the residues matched by the known protein structures are classified as ordered and the residues covered by remark  <dig> annotations in these structures are assigned to the disorder class.

disprot r <dig> 
the sl dataset comprises the disprot release  <dig>  data in addition to residues in the same proteins annotated as having an ordered 3d structure found by similarity searches among sequences of known tertiary structure. since some of these structures contain unidentified segments , the number of residues with disorder annotation in sl is slightly larger than in disprot

as a result,  <dig> % of its residues are annotated as ordered against  <dig> % as disordered. this number is comparable to the 6% of disordered residues from the  <dig> targets used in the disorder prediction benchmark of casp <dig>  <cit> . the assessment of disorder prediction has been successfully introduced during the 5th critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction   <cit>  and established since then during the following casp experiments  <cit> . however, datasets based exclusively on remark  <dig> are often restricted to shorter disordered regions, do not easily account for longer ones and do not include information when disorder plays a functional role, as considered in disprot.

the sl dataset is the unification of disprot r <dig>  and our remark  <dig> datasets. in conflicting cases of annotations, the disordered description was maintained in sl and the information about order was discarded. we considered it important to maintain the disorder annotation also for regions that fold into structures under specific conditions, such as binding with another globular domain or in a crystal context. the sl dataset contains more short disordered regions than the remark  <dig> dataset . this comes from the fact that the sl dataset has additional disorder annotation that is not limited to the missing coordinates in the pdb. further, it comprises very long disordered regions, or completely disordered proteins, classified as intrinsically disordered proteins . one such example is the bcl <dig> antagonist of cell death  that contains the bh <dig> motif. this protein, of approximately  <dig> residues, is annotated as having an ฮฑ-helical region comprising  <dig> structural residues  in the remark  <dig> dataset with no disorder information, while in the sl dataset, the complete sequence is annotated as disordered, given that the bh <dig> motif is known to form its helical structure upon interaction with other anti-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family  <cit> .

for comparing the length of disordered regions relative to the amount of disordered residues in each of the datasets, we calculated the cumulative percentage distributions shown in figure  <dig>  we see that, in the sl dataset, 50% of disordered regions are shorter than  <dig> residues . however, this number accounts for only 8% of the total number of disordered residues in the dataset. in fact, 50% of disordered residues are found in regions up to  <dig> residues in length, which covers 92% of disordered regions. the remaining 50% of disordered residues are found in very few, but even longer stretches of sequences.

comparatively, in the remark  <dig> dataset, 50% of disordered regions are shorter than  <dig> residues long . therefore, half of the disordered regions in each sl and remark  <dig> datasets are comparable to each other relative to the length of short disordered regions. however, in the remark  <dig> dataset, these short regions account for 18% of disordered residues compared to 8% in the sl dataset, confirming that the sl has longer disordered regions annotated. if we now consider 50% of disordered residues in remark  <dig>  we find that they are all in regions of up to  <dig> residues in length. there were only  <dig> disordered regions of length  <dig> and longer in the remark  <dig> dataset, against  <dig> in the sl one. these were the precursor of fibrinogen alpha chain from chicken , the precursor of human epidermal growth factor receptor  and the transcription initiation factor iia large subunit from baker's yeast . while the dataset of casp <dig> has only  <dig> regions of length > <dig> residues, our remark  <dig> dataset has  <dig> regions > <dig> residues. this was achieved by considering a much larger number of structural domains in comparison to casp <dig>  the sl dataset has  <dig> such regions.

clearly, if either disprot r <dig>  or remark  <dig> is independently considered as a benchmark dataset while evaluating disorder predictors, the results might be affected by the skew in the distribution between order and disorder information . in this regard, roc curves provide a good solution when assessing the predictors, as they are insensitive to changes in the ratio between the numbers of order and disorder examples  <cit> . however, several other measurements such as accuracy, probability excess   <cit>  or the matthews correlation coefficient   <cit>   are altered upon shifts of this ratio  <cit> . to overcome this issue and to have a more complete dataset where both order and disorder information is considered, we created the sl dataset. here, we have  <dig> % of residues annotated as disorder against 33% in the ordered state .

evaluating the predictors with the two benchmark datasets
we evaluated the performance of five selected disorder predictors over a wide range of parameters and the results are shown as roc curves in figure  <dig>  roc curves provide a guideline to select a compromise between the amount of false positive predictions  and the level of sensitivity  achieved by the classifier. if one wants to compare the performance among different predictors, the same specificity level should be taken into consideration. we list the parameters for each disorder predictor where the amount of false positive prediction is the closest to 5% in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  unfortunately, we could not produce a parameter setting for disembl remark  <dig> that corresponds to a specificity level of 95%. instead, our tables show values corresponding to 3-4% false positive predictions for this method.

predictors were run with parameters tuned to achieve a comparable specificity level close to  <dig> , which corresponds to ~5% of false positive predictions. for disembl remark  <dig> , parameter tuning only allowed a specificity of  <dig>  as closest value to our criterion. ranking is based on the matthews correlation coefficient  but remains essentially unchanged for other performance measures such as probability excess .

predictors were run and ranked as described in table  <dig> but over the remark  <dig> dataset which puts more emphasis on short disorder inside or flanking globular structures. for disembl remark  <dig> , parameter tuning only allowed a specificity of  <dig>  as closest value to our criterion.

obviously, the data shows that the ranking among the methods is essentially independent of the performance measurement used  both in tables  <dig>  and  <dig> . thus, the ratio between the numbers of ordered and disordered residues in the datasets has no effect on the relative ranking of methods. this is possible because the specificity level has been kept constant among all methods . to summarize, keeping constant the specificity or sensitivity levels is a precondition for a fair comparison among methods .

at approximately 95% specificity , disopred <dig>  <cit>  is the method with the highest percentage of correct predictions in both datasets  and it is followed very closely by iupred long  <cit>  in the sl dataset and iupred short  <cit>  in the remark  <dig> dataset. by comparing the two settings of iupred , we see that iupred long performs better than iupred short in the sl dataset, while the opposite consistently occurs in the remark  <dig> dataset . as expected by the different nature of the two available detection settings, iupred short was able to better identify remark  <dig> disordered regions than its long segment counterpart. but for detecting disorder in general, including long disordered regions, iupred long should be the preferred setting. disembl remark  <dig> also performs quite well and it is among the top  <dig> methods for the identification of short disordered regions . however, this is not surprising, given that disembl remark  <dig> was trained to detect this definition of disorder.

another picture emerges when the default settings are used . because of the different levels of specificity obtained under the default settings of each predictor, the simple ranking according to any measurement is compromised and different rankings are produced by following various performance indicators. for instance, if we were to rank the methods by highest sensitivity, disembl coils could be placed on the top row of table  <dig>  this, however, would come at the cost of accepting a very high false positive prediction rate . one should note here that disembl coils is trained to detect loops/coils that can be but are not necessarily required to be disordered. hence, this predictor alone is considered to be promiscuous  <cit> .

all predictors were run over the sl set using their respective default settings and ranked by the mcc. these settings produce results of varying levels of specificity which makes their ranking more dependent on the used overall performance measure .

predictors were run and ranked as described in table  <dig> but over the remark  <dig> dataset . as in table  <dig>  rankings differ if based on mcc or pe.

it is notable that the ranking of methods in accordance with various performance indicators is different for the two datasets sl  and remark  <dig> . this is a result of differing ratios of numbers of ordered and disordered residues in the two datasets .

we also explored the parameter settings where the matthews correlation coefficient  is maximized for each method. as the mcc approaches zero, the predictions are likely to be random, but as its value gets closer to  <dig>  the higher the correlation between the predictions and the annotation in the benchmark dataset. in this case, by selecting the threshold value producing the highest mcc in roc space, we are not focusing on which parameter to use to compare the different methods with each other at the same specificity level , as described previously, but rather which settings to apply if one wants to extract the best general predictor performance as judged by mcc. in this study, the highest mcc ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  when considering the ten different predictors benchmarked with the sl and remark  <dig> datasets, respectively . these discrepancies in correlation coefficients between the  <dig> datasets clearly indicate that the results of a benchmark in a biased dataset such as the remark  <dig> should only be taken into account in particular scenarios such as the identification of short disordered regions prior to structural elucidation. because of the different class distributions between the two datasets, the mcc should not be used to compare performance across the benchmark datasets. if the aim is to determine the general disposition of a protein to be disordered, which includes short and long regions, the results of a benchmark with a dataset such as the sl should be considered.

 predictors were run under parameters that produced the highest mcc over the sl dataset to benchmark their maximally possible performance. rankings by mcc and pe differ only slightly. interestingly, the identified optimal parameters  often differed from the default parameters of the respective programs, except for disopred <dig> 

predictors were run and ranked as described in table  <dig> but over the remark  <dig> dataset including parameter optimization for this dataset with focus on short disorder.

from the analysis of roc curves in figure  <dig>  we see that the predictions occur at different levels of specificity and sensitivity under default parameters . these default parameters did not always produce the best possible performance as judged by mcc . the only exception is disopred <dig> if applied over the sl dataset. at the same time, disopred <dig> exhibited the highest mcc among all other methods , followed very closely by iupred long  . the performance of iupred long under default parameters was sufficiently close to the one of highest mcc. basically, disopred <dig> and iupred long have comparable performances if both short and long disordered regions are taken into consideration, as in the sl dataset . additionally, disopred <dig> performed better than other methods for short disorder predictions . here, only iupred short had its default performance close to the one judged by the highest mcc .

the fact that disopred <dig> and iupred long have a comparable performance in the sl dataset provides an argument to select iupred long over disopred <dig>  when speed in calculation is an issue. this helped in the selection of iupred long over disopred <dig> in the implementation of algorithms in the annie webserver  <cit> , given that disopred <dig> considers sequentially similar sequences through psi-blast generated alignments, augmenting considerably the amount of computational time .

finally, evaluating the predictors with two datasets gives a general overview and provides a desirable framework to obtain settings at comparable levels of specificity. these settings can be finally applied in semi-automated pipelines, such as in our in-house annotator/annie platform, to improve sequence function predictions in large-scale studies. the next step is to evaluate how combinations of such methods compare to individual performance, as addressed in the following section.

predicting long disorder
in the functional annotation process of uncharacterized protein sequences coming from full genome sequencing projects, the determination of long disordered regions is far more important than the detection of short disordered segments. the assumption is that long disordered regions are disordered because of the absence of a proper hydrophobic core that would force them into a stable globular structure. these long disordered regions rival globular domains in length and it is questionable whether they are suitable for distant homology searches. we tested the predictors for the detection of long disordered regions by modifying our sl dataset to annotate as disorder only the regions of length  <dig> and above. this subset is called ld <dig>  as we modify the annotation in the positive set only, the settings by which we obtain the desired specificity level of ~95% is the same as in table  <dig>  the ranking is displayed in table  <dig>  we find that the iupred long method obtained the highest ranking in this task followed by disopred <dig>  all other methods performed clearly worse. as expected, seg, which is commonly used for low complexity filtering in sequence similarity searches, ranks better with longer averaging window. the three disembl variants are not useful for the detection of long disorder regions.

predictors were run and ranked as in tables  <dig> and  <dig> with parameters tuned to produce comparable high specificity of ~ <dig>   but over the ld <dig> dataset which only includes long disordered regions . for disembl remark  <dig> , parameter tuning only allowed a specificity of  <dig>  as closest value to our criterion.

while this manuscript was in preparation, a new predictor specialized in long disorder regions, named iupforest-l, became available  <cit> . as this predictor could only be accessed through a webserver, we were forced to limit ourselves to obtain only a few data points displayed in the roc graph of figure  <dig> in additional file  <dig>  although the results ultimately appear to be the best ones for the detection of long disorder, this outcome should be considered carefully. when looking at individual proteins, small globular domains tend to be predicted as disordered under the default settings of iupforest-l. examples of such wrong predictions include multi-domain proteins such as the human dna-repair protein hhr23a and protein g.

low complexity and disorder: combining pairs of methods
one might think that the combination of disordered predictors leads to improved performance since they are based on different definitions of disordered regions. such an approach has already been suggested in the literature  <cit> . for example, seg  <cit>  is a very common and widely used method to filter out low complexity regions in sequence homology searches. this has enormously facilitated the identification of new globular regions in proteins  <cit> . however, not all disordered regions in proteins are low complexity regions  <cit> . therefore, seg does not perform very well in this study . we see that the bigger the window size parameter in seg, the better its performance in the sl dataset . can seg successfully complement, for example, disorder predictors derived from 3d structures or sequence similarity information  <cit> ?

if the predictors identified different regions of disorder due to their different methodological approaches, the combination of two methods together should outperform any individual method. it is not unusual that a more recently developed predictor is claimed to identify new disordered regions that were previously missed by more established methods in the literature such as disopred <dig> and that, in a combination, they should be beneficial for improved prediction performance  <cit> .

in this work, we explored the combined performance of any pair of disorder prediction algorithms. in contrast to previous work  <cit> , we used the parameters that reproduce the same level of specificity for each method at a false positive rate of  <dig>  . in addition, we also combined them applying the parameters where the highest mcc was obtained . the results of this investigation are summarized in figure  <dig>  as a trend, the combination of two methods either through consensus or complementary predictions results in a slight improvement of performance compared to single methods. we find that disopred <dig>  which has ranked quite well in the individual comparison to other methods, can only be slightly improved through combination with almost any method but, if at all, the best effect is achieved with iupred long, cast  <cit>  or disembl remark  <dig>  on the other hand, only the combination of iupred long with either cast  or disembl remark  <dig>  reaches the single method performance of disopred <dig>  this is of interest due to the long computation time required for disopred <dig> compared to other methods.

as expected, the result of combining the methods through consensus predictions is seen as a shift towards less false positive predictions in roc space, contrary to the complementary one, that is shifted towards more false positive predictions . still, neither consensus nor complementary predictions resulted in outstanding performances.

disorder in complete proteomes: the need of experimental validation to improve future predictions
undoubtedly, there is a strong necessity of more reliable annotation of disordered regions in protein sequences. so far, the disprot database is the most complete compilation of disorder annotation in proteins, given the current experimental limitations in disorder detection and its curated nature. its latest release contains  <dig> sequences with about 37% of them coming from humans. however, if we now consider the latest estimate of the human proteome in the ipi  <cit>  and calculate the percentage of human sequences that have been annotated as disordered in disprot, we obtain the extremely low fraction of only ~ <dig> %. in previous work using disopred <dig>  the approximate fraction of residues predicted as disordered in humans was 21%  <cit> . we used iupred long to predict disorder in a non-redundant set of  <dig> sequences of the ipi human database and obtained a comparable percentage of disordered residues  as in the previous work with disopred <dig>  <cit>  . the list of actual predictions is available from the website that is associated with this paper http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sequences/disorder/.

a subset with  <dig> non-redundant sequences  from the human ipi v <dig>  database was used to estimate frequencies of disordered residues and sequences with disorder predicted by iupred long at different thresholds 

clearly, identification through experimental validation of all these disorder predictions could increase quite considerably the number of proteins annotated as disordered and the understanding of their role in biological processes, so far mainly found to participate in signalling, recognition and regulation  <cit> . at the same time that predictors are developed to automate the detection and annotation of protein disorder, there is a general saturation and little improvement with newer disorder predictors  <cit> . apparently, more experimentally supported disorder annotation appears necessary, despite the big effort in attempting to identify functional classes associated to disorder by using theoretical arguments  <cit> .

comparison to other benchmark studies
the largest database of disorder to date, disprot, should not be taken directly as a benchmark set due to the lack of coverage of the order annotation. on the other hand, previously used benchmark sets are based on disorder annotated as remark  <dig> in the pdb, which provides very good quality order annotation. however, such sets typically only cover short disordered regions in close vicinity to or inside otherwise globular structures, which is only one of the many flavours of disorder in proteins  <cit> . to provide a compromise between the best sources for disorder  and order , we complemented the disprot annotation with known ordered regions if respective atom coordinates of disprot proteins were recorded in the pdb.

furthermore, disordered regions of minimum length  <dig> annotated in pdb as remark  <dig> that map to unannotated regions in disprot proteins were added as well. this procedure of extending the annotation of disprot proteins has the additional advantage that both ordered and disordered regions are taken from the same protein set which means that any compositional bias resulting from different taxonomic distributions or subcellular localization sampling  is avoided in our benchmark set.

there have been many benchmark studies on disorder predictors over the last ten years, with casp being a major reference in the field, despite its limitation due to a dataset built up in its majority by crystallographic structures that are generally known to display mainly short disordered regions. typically, benchmark studies are accompanied by the development of a new predictor and are aimed at showing its performance in contrast to previously existing methods.

in a recent review  <cit> , a few practical examples were used to show how the combination of different methods improves disorder prediction, as the methods are generally biased towards detecting different definitions of disorder. here, we saw that the combination of methods did not result in outstanding performances, which would be expected if they were detecting different flavours of disorder upon a benchmark with a general dataset such as our sl one. despite their biases in disorder detection, they were not complementary to each other to the extent that it would be worth considering a pair of methods since they just marginally increase the number of correct predictions.

most benchmarks also use many different scores to rank the predictors due to the natural difficulty in defining what constitutes a good performance in roc space. we have already underlined previously that certain performance measures such as mcc depend on the composition of the database, i.e., the ratio of residues with disordered and ordered annotation. in contrast, the probability excess is an example that is independent of this ratio  <cit> . in the latter study, the authors rank and compare the performance of the different methods regardless of a fixed specificity setting. this ultimately generates misinterpretations of what is judged as best, as only data points at default parameters are considered, while the methods should be compared at the same specificity level. as we have seen previously, the influence of choice of the performance measure to rank the methods becomes almost irrelevant, when they are compared at the same specificity level.

CONCLUSIONS
the lack of a precise definition of disorder is a major problem that directly affects the dataset used for benchmarking. consequently, it strongly influences any measurable outcome, such as accuracy, mcc, probability excess, including the specificity level of the predictor. in this work, we have derived a general dataset based on all currently available data that includes most or all flavours and lengths of disorder for a thorough evaluation of disorder predictors. we complemented the curated disorder annotation in the disprot database with order annotation from well defined structures in pdb, as well as associated short disorder regions. thereby, we essentially doubled the number of annotated residues compared to the original disprot  <dig>  annotation.

ideally, predictors should not be ranked using a single performance measurement at their default settings, since these typically produce results in different areas of the roc space. instead, we suggest to test and identify settings where the specificity or sensitivity over the same unbiased dataset is directly comparable. in our in-house sequence analysis pipeline annotator/annie  <cit>  and proteome-wide studies, predictions at high specificity are required and we present threshold and parameter settings for the tested predictors in this scenario.

in our work, we showed that combining different methods yields a positive improvement but the results are not dramatically different, especially if one wants to use the methods for the identification of disorder in complete proteomes. so far, disopred <dig> has been the method that best unifies all information, but it is limited because of the time demanding psi-blast step for proteome-wide studies. interestingly, the faster iupred long that uses a totally different approach was essentially performing similarly well and, at the same time, it is computationally cheaper.

although the number of annotated residues in the sl dataset appears substantial, it has to be assumed that still only a small fraction of actually disordered regions are currently covered by these annotations. besides the large number of unannotated disordered regions reliably predicted at thresholds with high specificity, one cannot exclude the possibility that additional flavours of disorder exist that are not properly captured by any of the existing experimental methods.
