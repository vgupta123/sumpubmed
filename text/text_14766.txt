BACKGROUND
weather-based forecasting systems reduce the cost of production by optimizing the timing and frequency of application of control measures and ensures operator, consumer and environmental safety by reducing chemical usage. a major aim of many forecasting systems is to reduce fungicide use, and accurate prediction is important to synchronize the use of disease control measures to avoid crop losses  <cit> . a prediction model based on the relationship between environmental conditions at the time of management and late-season disease severity could be used to guide management decisions. thus, if a sound forewarning system is developed, the explosive nature of the disease could be prevented by timely application of the control measures. various techniques of computer modeling and simulation viz. machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks and the conventional multiple regression approaches are being used to help synthesize and develop scientists' understanding of this complex plant-pathogen-environment relationship. the resultant models enable exploration of the factors that govern disease epidemics and the design of control systems that minimize yield losses. the same models have potential to guide breeding programs and work to develop strategies that will prolong the usefulness of disease-resistance genes. thus, we undertook the present case study on rice blast disease forecasting by following a new prediction approach, support vector machine and compared its performance with the existing artificial neural networks-based and multiple regression-based prediction approaches.

rice  is the single most important food crop for more than one-third of the world's population. of the various diseases limiting rice productivity, blast disease caused by pyricularia grisea sacc. {magnaporthe grisea  barr.} continues to be an enigmatic problem in several rice growing ecosystems of both tropical and temperate regions of the world and is a serious constraint in realizing the full yield potential of rice cultivars. it continues to be the most destructive disease of rice despite decades of research towards its control. weather has a very important role to play in the appearance, multiplication and spread of the blast fungus. considerable efforts have been directed towards developing blast-resistant cultivars, but due to high variability in blast pathogen, most of the resistant varieties frequently succumb to this disease. therefore, the most practical way to control blast epidemics have been the use of fungicides. however, due to high cost of chemicals as well as their hazardous effects, use of fungicides is invariably uneconomic. moreover, farmers are sometimes forced to skip the actual date of fungicide application due to lack of knowledge regarding the actual time of appearance of the disease. therefore, for the judicious use of fungicides, forewarning of blast is very important.

previous attempts to describe the relationship between rice blast severity and environmental conditions have been made in various countries through both the empirical and explanatory simulation models developed only through the conventional regression analysis viz. in japan  <cit> , korea  <cit> , china  <cit> , taiwan  <cit> , india  <cit> , thailand  <cit>  and the philippines  <cit> . however, very limited use of these models have been implemented by farmers to manage rice blast because of two plausible reasons: firstly, growers/farmers tend to be risk-aversed and are not properly convinced on the use of disease forecasting tools, and secondly, the mathematical relationships between the environmental conditions and the specific stages of rice blast infection cycle are not fully understood. this makes conventional modeling approaches such as multiple regression difficult.

various other attempts to establish a quantitative relationship between weather and disease infection from field studies have not always been successful. davis et al. did not find any obvious relationship between disease severity and weather, and infection could not be associated with any specific sequence of weather events  <cit> . using multiple linear regression  analysis, chakraborty and billard showed that reg model was not equally effective in predicting infection events in the  <dig> years of their field study in australia  <cit> . subsequently, another independent study has shown that the reg model does not adequately explain infection at a field site in queensland, australia  <cit> . these studies indicate that, although the reg models were able to explain disease development at a particular field site for certain years, its ability to generalize across field sites and years was poor. diverse modeling approaches have therefore, been followed for advanced understanding  of phenomena associated with disease in plant populations. till date, artificial neural networks  have been reported to be the good alternate to the conventional multiple regression techniques as anns are reputed to excel at extracting sometimes subtle patterns from large multivariate data sets without preconceived assumptions about model form due to incompletely understood, possibly complex, relationships  <cit> . the next major advancement was a feedback function of ann that adjusted weights to minimal error values; however, popularization of anns as a distinct class of models occurred in the 1980s when the activation threshold was replaced by a continuous function and a multilayer network took derivatives from a backpropagation of errors to approximate the target output by nonlinear functions  <cit> . another alternative to back-propagation that has been widely used in regression problems is the generalized regression neural network, which involves one-pass learning algorithm with a highly parallel structure that provides estimates of continuous variables and converges to the underlying  regression surface  <cit> . both these backpropagation neural network  and generalized regression neural network  architectures has remained a mainstay among the models in the ann family.

however, both these ann architectures have there own limitations. one disadvantage of backpropagation is that it can take a large number of iterations to converge to the desired solution. it also requires very long training time and is subject to converging to local minima instead of finding the global minimum error surface. for a mature application, the long training time may be justified. to guard against getting trapped in local minima, the bpnn can be compared with the grnn accuracy as it is fast learning and have ability to convergence to the optimal regression surface as the number of samples becomes very large  <cit> . however, grnn also requires substantial computation to evaluate new points. it trains almost instantly, but tends to be large and slow. grnn also does not extrapolate i.e. its inability in predicting the value of unknown data points by projecting a function beyond the range of known data points  <cit> . thus, there is an urgent need of exploiting the latest upcoming prediction softwares for better and improved understanding of the plant-pathogen-environment relationships.

this paper introduces a new prediction method based on a powerful machine learning technique support vector machines  originally developed by vapnik and co-workers at bell laboratories as a very effective method for general-purpose supervised predictions  <cit> . it has been shown in the past that this machine learning technique is very effective in the classification of proteins particularly in discriminating membrane proteins  <cit> , prediction of subcellular localization  <cit> , solvent accessibility  <cit> , ctl epitopes  <cit> , binding peptides  <cit> , protein structures  <cit> , protein-protein binding sites  <cit>  and gene expression level  <cit> . svm provides an alternative or complement to the present ann and reg based approaches for model development. the svm learns how to classify from a training set of feature vectors, whose expected outputs are already known. the training enables a binary classifying svm to define a plane in the feature space, which optimally separates the training vectors of two classes. when a new feature vector is fed, its class is predicted on the basis of which side of the plane it maps. to the best of authors' knowledge, there is no report of using support vector machines in understanding the relationship between disease severity and its associated environmental conditions.

hence, the present case study was aimed to determine the usefulness of svm models over the existing artificial neural network and conventional multiple regression models to predict rice blast severity based on prevailing weather conditions both within and between the locations/years, and to calculate the overall risk of rice blast infection at these field sites using a set of weights from the trained svm models. for this, we used 5-year rice blast/weather data collected from five different locations spread over the district kangra of himachal pradesh  as part of a national agricultural technology project  which was implemented at csk himachal pradesh agricultural university, palampur, himachal pradesh . this paper reports the first ever disease prediction models as well as web-based server developed using svm, worldwide.

RESULTS
cross-location model development and validation
within each year, cross-location models were developed and validated separately with reg, bpnn, grnn and svm approaches . in the year  <dig>  when cross-location multiple regression models were validated against each other, the coefficient of determination  value went maximum up to  <dig>  with its corresponding percent mean absolute error  value of  <dig>  ; however, with bpnn-based validation, the r <dig> improved by about 21% to  <dig>  with almost 36% improvement in its corresponding % mae value ; which further increased to r <dig> =  <dig>  with improvement in its respective % mae , when grnn-based validation approach was applied. when svm-based validation approach was performed, the r <dig> improved by about 9% to  <dig> , with also 9% decrease in its % mae value . in  <dig>  the maximum r <dig> value observed was  <dig>  with  <dig> % mean absolute error with reg based validation , whereas the r <dig> improved to  <dig>  with improvement in its respective % mae value also  with bpnn approach which further increased by 17% to r <dig> =  <dig>  with 24% improvement in its corresponding % mae  when grnn-based validation approach was followed. with svm, about 11% increase in coefficient of determination  corresponded to about 9% improvement in percent mean absolute error . in  <dig>  with reg-based validation, maximum r <dig> reached up to  <dig>  with its respective % mae value as  <dig>  , whereas the r <dig> value went maximum up to  <dig>  with drastic improvement in its respective % mae value  when validated with bpnn-based approach  which further improved to r <dig> =  <dig>  and % mae =  <dig>  with grnn-based validation approach. the r <dig> increased drastically to  <dig>  with improvement in its corresponding % mae to  <dig>  when svm-based validation approach was performed . in  <dig>  maximum r <dig> reached up to  <dig>  having corresponding % mae value of  <dig>  with reg based validation , however with bpnn-based validation, the r <dig> improved to  <dig>  with improvement in its % mae  also. maximum r <dig> and % mae achieved with grnn was  <dig>  and  <dig>  which was respectively about 27% and 12% better than bpnn . with svm, the r <dig> slightly increased to  <dig>  with drastic improvement of about 30% in its corresponding % mae to  <dig> . similarly in  <dig>  the maximum r <dig> value attained with reg based validation was  <dig>  with its corresponding % mae value of  <dig>  , whereas with bpnn-based validation, an 8% increase in r <dig>  corresponded to about 33% improvement in its respective % mae value  which with grnn, again increased to r <dig> =  <dig>  with decrease in its corresponding % mae . as observed earlier, the svm again outperformed all the three other approaches with about 16% increase in r <dig> to  <dig>  as well as improvement in its corresponding mean absolute error to  <dig> %.

cross-year model development and validation
within each location, cross-year models were also developed and validated. here also, comparison between all the four approaches followed was made on the basis of r <dig> and % mae values . all the locations showed improvement in r <dig> values and decrease in percent mean absolute error values when models developed with svm were validated against the test data as compared to the reg, bpnn and grnn-based validation approaches. at location-i , when within year cross validation was performed with reg, the r <dig> went maximum up to  <dig>  with the corresponding % mae value of  <dig>  , whereas with bpnn approach, the r <dig> value improved to  <dig>  and the % mae value improved to  <dig>  which further increased to r <dig> =  <dig>  with its respective % mae =  <dig>  when grnn was performed. the svm-based validation approach showed about 9% increase in r <dig> value  with about 10% simultaneous improvement in its % mae . at location-ii , maximum r <dig> observed was  <dig>  with its respective % mae as  <dig>   with reg approach, whereas the bpnn-based validation achieved about 23% higher coefficient of determination  with about 48% simultaneous improvement in its corresponding % mae also . with grnn, the r <dig> showed drastic increase of about 26%  with also improvement in its % mae to  <dig> , however, when svm was followed, the r <dig> remained constant but the % mae improved by about 15% to  <dig>  thereby again indicating the supremacy of svm over the other three approaches. at location-iii , with reg, maximum r <dig> was observed to be  <dig>   with a mean absolute error of  <dig> %; however, the r <dig> increased to  <dig>  with also improvement in % mae  with bpnn-based validation . the grnn again improved the r <dig> and % mae to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . with svm, the r <dig> increased by about 5% to  <dig>  with also about 11% improvement in its respective % mae . at location-iv , maximum r <dig> value went up to  <dig>  with the % mae value of  <dig>   with reg approach. with bpnn, the r <dig> remained constant but the % mae showed about 3% improvement . with grnn-based validation, the r <dig> increased slightly by about 2% to  <dig> , but the % mae improved drastically by about 35% . the r <dig> again increased to  <dig>  with improvement in its corresponding % mae to  <dig>  . similarly, at location-v , the maximum r <dig> value observed with reg was  <dig>  with the corresponding % mae value as  <dig>  , whereas the r <dig> improved by about 13% to  <dig>  with its corresponding % mae as  <dig> , an error improvement of about 20%  when validated with bpnn-based approach. the grnn again proved better over reg and bpnn as the r <dig> increased by about 7% to  <dig>  with improvement in its respective % mae value to  <dig>  . however, svm again proved its supremacy over all the approaches followed by achieving drastic increase of about 15%  in coefficient of determination  as well as simultaneous improvement of about 35% in its respective percent mean absolute error value .

average comparison of prediction accuracy
overall, the r <dig> and percent mean absolute error showed better improvement with svm based validation tests as compared to the reg, bpnn and grnn approaches . in case of 'cross-location' models, maximum coefficient of determination  was observed for the year  <dig> as compared to the other years performance with the % mae value of  <dig>  with reg approach which improved to r <dig> =  <dig>  and % mae =  <dig>  when bpnn-based validation approach was followed. with grnn, the r <dig> showed an increase of about 8% in average r <dig> value  with about 11% improvement in its respective average % mae . the svm-based validation approach again revealed an increase of 8% in average r <dig> value to  <dig>  and simultaneous improvement in its % mae also by about 7% . similar improvement in average r <dig> and % mae values was also observed in 'cross-year' models validation. the maximum average coefficient of determination  was observed for location-iv  showing  <dig> % mean absolute error with reg-based validation approach which increased by 6% to r <dig> =  <dig>  and % mae also improved by about 17%  with bpnn-based validation. the average r <dig> further increased by 8% to  <dig>  and the % mae also improved by 9% to  <dig>  with grnn. however, the svm-based validation again increased the average r <dig> to  <dig> , a jump of about 10% with simultaneous improvement by about 7% in its respective % mae also .

in order to have overall comparison of all the four approaches followed, the overall r <dig> value averaged over all the years for 'cross-location' models with reg was observed to be  <dig>  with its corresponding % mae as  <dig> . when bpnn was applied, the overall r <dig> increased by 8% to  <dig>  and % mae  also improved by about 11%. the grnn further increased the r <dig> to  <dig> , an increase of 12% with 8% improvement in its respective % mae . however, the svm gave the best reachable average r <dig> value of  <dig> , again an increase by 12% with its corresponding % mae value of  <dig> , which also improved drastically by about 14%. for 'cross-year' models, the average r <dig> was found to be  <dig>  with its respective % mae of  <dig> , which showed an increase of 10%  with bpnn with simultaneous 13% improvement in its % mae  also. further, the grnn-based validation increased the average r <dig>  by 11% and improved % mae by about 6% . the svm-based validation approach again proved its supremacy over the other three approaches by increasing the r <dig> further to  <dig> , an increase by 10%. the respective % mae  also improved by about 10%. the 'cross-year' models showed slightly higher coefficient of determination and least percent mean absolute error values with all the four approaches followed in this study indicating that 'cross-year' predictions are better with respect to their accuracy and confidence level as compared to the 'cross-location' predictions.

best predictor variables
for 'cross-location' validation, the best svm model was observed during  <dig> with location-v as test data  with the highest correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and percent mean absolute error of  <dig> . the performance of this model was again tested by excluding each weather variable at a time by repeated training and testing. the results revealed that rainfall was most influential in predicting the disease followed by rainy days/week, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity, minimum temperature and maximum temperature . similarly, for 'cross-year' models, the best svm model was observed at location-v  with the year  <dig> as test data with the highest correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and least percent mean absolute error of  <dig> . the rainfall was again found to be the best predictor variable. however, the second most influential variable was found to be minimum relative humidity followed by maximum relative humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainy days/week. overall, the rainfall was observed to be the best predictor among the weather variables followed by relative humidity and rainy days/week. the temperature was found to have least effect on disease development.

finally, we selected the best prediction models for each of the four approaches followed viz. reg, bpnn, grnn and svm based on the maximum coefficient of determination and least percent mean absolute error values. then, we plotted the observed and predicted mean disease severities to compare their prediction accuracy both for 'cross-year' as well as 'cross-location' models. within the cross-year models, best prediction accuracy was observed for location-iv  and for location-v . furthermore, best testing was observed with the year  <dig> data at all the locations except for location-iv  where best validation was observed with  <dig> data. in case of cross-location models, best prediction accuracy was observed for  <dig> and  <dig> years data .

description of web server
a web-based server, rb-pred, was developed to predict the severity percent of leaf blast. rb-pred is beautifully designed and is a user-friendly and easy-to-use web server. users just have to feed the recorded weather variables prevailing in their areas viz. temperature , temperature , relative humidity , relative humidity , rainfall and rainy days/week data in the 'submit' form of the server . based on the maximum correlation coefficient and least percent mean absolute error, we have selected the two best models each for 'cross-location' as well as for 'cross-year' predictions. we have saved the model files of these best models in the server. when the user feed the weather variables, the server classifies them according to these model files and generates the predicted leaf blast severity  separately for cross-location as well as cross-year predictions. as the cross-year correlation was observed more than the cross-location validation, the predicted blast severity seems to be more accurate for 'cross-year' predictions as compared to the 'cross-location' predictions and thus, the default submit parameter was set on 'cross-year' models.

although, the server is working quite well and will be beneficial to the plant pathologists and farmers; we are working towards the in-season real time weather based disease predictions where the web server will itself train the weather variables fed by the users and will ultimately, forecast the real time disease severity for their respective areas.

discussion
this work is the first initiative of applying support vector machine tools to developing weather-based prediction models for plant diseases as the usefulness of svm over the existing neural networks  and the conventional multiple regression approaches in predicting plant diseases have not been reported yet from any part of the world. while previous research, particularly on rice blast prediction, has largely been focused on the conventional multiple regression approaches, no serious effort with new prediction softwares in improving the prediction accuracy of these models have been employed. there is an urgent need to manage rice blast by better understanding of the mathematical relationships between the environmental conditions and its specific stages of infection cycle. the rationale behind the use of early- and mid-season information to predict late-season rice blast severity lies in the fact that this disease is strongly influenced by environmental conditions favourable for initial inoculum production and initial infection. thus, it was necessary to use other empirical approaches in an effort to understand the relationship between the environment and disease  development. the results of the present study by using svm-based regression approach have led to a better description of this relationship between the environmental conditions and disease level which could be useful for disease management.

though, within the neural networks, the generalized regression neural network outperformed the backpropagation neural networks by about 20–30%. this is due to the fact that grnn have greater understanding of model results , less reliance on parameter optimization, and have minimum probability of being trapped in local minima during error gradient descent. similar results of improvement in prediction accuracy through grnn as compared to the bpnn have also been reported by chtioui et al. for moisture prediction from simple micrometeorological data  <cit> , wolf and francl  <cit>  for prediction of tan spot and stagonospora blotch infection periods, and francl  <cit>  for modeling wetness duration. however, one major significant contribution of this study has been the improvement of r <dig> and % mae values with svm as compared to the existing bpnn and grnn and the conventional reg approaches. we demonstrated this by comparing all the four approaches in best possible combinations i.e. training and testing of both cross-location as well as cross-year prediction models. all the locations/years' data showed improved r <dig> and least % mae values with svm based validation procedures indicating that svm holds better supremacy over the other three modeling techniques. the advantages of using svm over the other methods lies in the fact that svms are known to be robust when one has a sparsely filled high dimensional dataset as shown in some of the earlier studies  <cit> . it maps data into a high dimensional space via kernels where a linear decision boundary is constructed. such boundary corresponds to a non-linear one in the input space  <cit> . some other most remarkable advantages of svms are the absence of local minima, the sparseness of the solution, and the use of the kernel-induced feature spaces  <cit> . the flexibility allowed by this modeling approach makes it possible to fit non-linear relationships and complex interactions between variables without requiring complex transformations of variables and trial-and-error searches for interactions as required in neural networks. for a system like leaf blast of rice for which the relationships between the environment and disease development are not fully understood with conventional statistical techniques, svm serves as an excellent tool for developing prediction models. previous attempts to predict the severity of this disease using reg approaches yielded results inferior to those being reported in this study using svm.

while previous research has largely used data from the same site  <cit> , the work reported here demonstrated that data from some or all field sites could be used for cross-sites prediction with equal accuracy as that with the within-site prediction models. all the reg, bpnn, grnn and svm models were used to predict rice leaf blast severity for locations that were never used in model training/development. training and testing sites were geographically distant and were spread over district kangra of himachal pradesh . both cross-year as well as cross-location wise training and testing of prediction models was done in order to compare their results for efficient validation across the two procedures. in general, the cross-year models showed slightly higher coefficient of determination and lower percent mean absolute error values as compared to the cross-location models during all the validation approaches followed in this study viz. reg, bpnn, grnn and svm. moreover, when the observed and predicted disease severity values were plotted for both the models, the cross-year models showed less deviation between the observed and predicted curves as compared to the cross-location models . this indicated that the 'cross-year' models  are better in terms of their prediction accuracy to the 'cross-location' models . in other words, we can say that location-specific models have better predictability and higher confidence of prediction.

moreover, despite the rigorous and stringent validation procedures followed in this study for all the four approaches, the multi-location data showed more robustness and usefulness over a broad range of field sites. this important contribution also demonstrates the obvious underlying principle that the basic quantitative relationship between rice blast development and weather does not change from site to site, given that an inoculum source of a virulent pathogen and a susceptible host is present. however, using data only from locations with similar characteristics may be useful but these models essentially become location-specific and lose application over a broad range of locations. that's why the plotted observed and predicted disease severities showed more deviation in some cases for 'cross-location' models even with svm as compared to the 'cross-year' models . moreover, these prediction techniques are based on various mathematical functions which try to predict the biological functions as accurately as they can, but it is difficult to predict the actual values with hundred per cent accuracy as the environmental factor, which is highly variable, always play a major role in disease predictions. however, our main concern in the present investigation was to evaluate the status of currently available approaches for predicting plant diseases in comparison to the latest prediction techniques that are still unexploited like svm in this case. it was observed that svm performed better than bpnn, grnn and reg on the dataset used in this study. it does not indicate that in general, svm is better than neural networks or the other methods. our analysis on the present dataset revealed better prediction accuracy with svm over all the years and locations as compared to the reg, bpnn and grnn-based validation approaches which is an important and significant contribution of this study.

CONCLUSIONS
the application of svm models for plant disease prediction as revealed from the present case study on rice blast prediction makes them a useful tool for future forecasting models, and combining aspects of svm and other established statistical tools may offer a more flexible option for the future. experimental approaches, linked with dynamic models, are more adequate approaches allowing a better understanding of the dynamics of the systems. to date, only multiple regression and neural networks are being used extensively for forecasting plant diseases in various parts of the world. the higher predictive accuracy by latest machine learning techniques like svm as demonstrated in the present study will generate more efficient prediction models which will help explain the factors that govern disease epidemics, and help in the design of control systems that minimize yield losses. rice blast disease causes between 11% and 30% crop losses annually. this represents a loss of  <dig> million tonnes of rice  <cit> . progression of the disease varies in different locations and years, depending mainly on weather conditions. therefore, forecasting of blast epidemics is necessary if growers are to prevent severe yield losses caused by the disease  <cit> . growers many want to know when the disease will start, how severe the epidemic will be, whether fungicides should be applied, and if so, when. for this, scientists are using computer modeling and simulation to synthesize and understand this complex pathosystem. however, there is no online disease prediction tool available that have potential to guide the farmers and researchers to develop various strategies for efficient control of plant diseases by timely forecasting of disease occurrence. 'rb-pred' web-based server, which is freely available, is an initiative in this direction for forecasting leaf blast severity based on the weather variables which may help the farmers and plant pathologists in their decision making process. based on the maximum r <dig> and least % mae values, the best prediction models developed with these four approaches followed in this study are being selected and a practical management program  for rice blast is being developed at this centre using these models. requiring in-season weather data as input, this server will directly serve to assess the risk of disease  epidemics and recommending timely application of fungicides. thus, the present web server could play an important tool in integrated rice blast management system for direct application to plant pathologists, academicians and farmers which will ultimately have direct economic impact in terms of  reduction in expenses to develop new fungicides,  development of target-site specific and environment-friendly fungicides, and  increase in savings by reducing fungicide application.
