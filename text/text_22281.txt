BACKGROUND
approximately 20 % of human cancers are caused by infectious agents  <cit> , including > <dig>  patients diagnosed annually with human papillomavirus  associated cancers. oncogenic hpv, denoted as “high-risk”, is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer due to its exclusive tropism for mucosal tissues  <cit> . upon persistent infections of the cervical mucosa, oncogenic hpvs can cause progression from low- to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias that, without ablative treatment, may develop into invasive carcinomas. at the molecular level hpv is a double-stranded dna virus and, to date, the sequences of over  <dig> types have been described  <cit> . the ~ <dig> kbp genome of hpv contains  <dig> functional open reading frames  that encode  <dig> early gene products  and  <dig> late gene products . while e <dig> and e <dig> are involved in dna replication and transcriptional regulation of the viral genome  <cit> , hpv’s potent tumourigenicity is primarily due to e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , and e <dig>  <cit> . l <dig> and l <dig> are structural proteins that self-assemble to form icosahedral capsids  <cit> , while the fused product of orfs e <dig> and e <dig>  is most abundant in the productive viral life cycle, coinciding with the onset of viral dna amplification  <cit> .

among the hpv types, hpv <dig>  is the most prevalent in cervical cancers. intriguingly, and perhaps related to its prevalence, the hpv <dig> genome is polymorphic. evolutionary analyses have revealed that the worldwide diversity of hpv <dig> genomes evolved for over  <dig>  years  <cit> , leading to five phylogenetic branches representing isolates from africa, europe, asia and the americas  <cit> . furthermore, each branch can be further dissected into intratypic single nucleotide polymorphisms  or variants differing in their host persistence and frequency of detection in human pre-cancers and cancers . the tumourigenic differences of these snps have been ascribed largely to those within the e <dig> oncogene . the asian-american  and european prototype  are common hpv <dig> genome variants which differ by six snps in their e <dig> genes, three of which are non-synonymous, leading to the 151-residue aae <dig> protein differing by three amino-acids: q14h, h78y, and l83v  <cit>  .

epidemiological studies showed that the aae <dig> genome variant is a higher risk factor for dysplasia as well as an earlier onset of invasive tumours than epe <dig> . as well, aae <dig> has a greater transforming, migratory, and invasive potential than epe <dig> when retrovirally transduced into primary human keratinocytes during recent long-term in vitro immortalization studies . these results suggested that coding changes in e <dig> have strong mechanistic and functional consequences for infection and thus contribute to marked differences in cancer risk of hpv <dig> variants.

to decipher the fundamental biology of hpvs and their tumourigenic features in a model system, the organotypic 3d infection model  has the advantage of allowing reproducible and simultaneous epithelial differentiation and hence the occurrence of an active viral life cycle . thus, using engineered human epithelium resembling in vivo conditions based on near-diploid immortalized keratinocytes  we recently elucidated the phenotypic characteristics of both e <dig> gene variants in the context of the full hpv <dig> genome  <cit> , building upon previous work on the effects of transduction with the e <dig> or e6/e <dig> genes only  <cit> . using the organotypic model we observed that the aae <dig> genome drives tumourigenesis by increasing epithelial proliferation, disrupting routine differentiation and apoptosis, evading the innate immune system and promoting immortalization  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed that the differences in host epithelia histologically classified as mild keratinizing  or moderate  dysplasia were reflective of increased oncogene  expression in aae <dig> cultures and loss of productive life cycle . together these observations lead us to suspect integration of the aae <dig> viral dna into the host genome  <cit> , a common phenomenon during hpv-induced tumourigenesis .fig.  <dig> the hpv <dig> genome and our experimental epithelial model. contained within the viral protein capsid  is the  <dig>  kb hpv <dig> genome, comprised of eight viral genes. over a 14 day differentiation process we grew three-dimensional organotypic epithelia, or raft cultures, using near-diploid immortalized keratinocytes  and primary human fibroblasts embedded in collagen-based dermal matrix. to permit the viral life cycle in this culture system we transfected the keratinocytes, prior to rafting, with complete viral genomes containing either the european prototype or asian-american variant of hpv <dig> e <dig> . niks represented normal epithelia, niks with hpv <dig> epe <dig> was a mild dysplasia , whereas niks with hpv <dig> aae <dig> was a moderate dysplasia . additionally, hpv <dig> viral integration was detected in aae <dig> epithelia




here, to further advance our mechanistic understanding of the impact of these common but epidemiologically and clinically important e <dig> snps, we conducted an “-omics” analysis on the niks-based organotypic epithelia containing the hpv <dig> variants aae <dig> and epe <dig> . modern deep sequencing techniques have been used to study hpv , but only recently in the context of intratypic variants  <cit> , and not using an organotypic epithelial model with full viral variant genomes. instead, our complete approach allowed a comparison of these variants with regards to their integration capacity and subsequent transcriptional consequences in close to in vivo conditions, resulting in viral integration and a molecular signature of host chromosomal instability for aae <dig> only.

RESULTS
viral integration in the hpv <dig> aae <dig> but not epe <dig> epithelium
to permit the viral life cycle in a raft culture system, we transfected the keratinocytes, prior to rafting, with complete viral genomes containing either the hpv <dig> epe <dig> or aae <dig> variant. a similar technique was used in a recent study to successfully study varicella zoster virus  <cit> , providing a keratinocyte model and a “global” perspective of all changes in host transcription in response to a pathogen. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  over a 14 day differentiation process, we observed that the niks were normal epithelia whereas niks with hpv <dig> epe <dig> exhibited a mild dysplasia and niks with hpv <dig> aae <dig> exhibited a moderate dysplasia.

to examine the hpv status of these cells we used the highly sensitive and high-throughput dna capture and sequencing technique named capt-hpv  <cit> . we prepared genomic dna from epithelia of both epe <dig> and aae <dig>  then, after double capture on the hpv probes, we performed 2 × 151 nt paired-end sequencing . as expected, we readily identified numerous hpv reads in both epithelial cultures. the sequencing reads of the e <dig> coding region confirmed the positive infection of the epithelia by the aae <dig> and epe <dig> variants. however, as we hypothesized  <cit> , the physical genomic status of hpv was clearly different. in the epe <dig> epithelia, the reads covered the entire hpv genome indicative of its episomal state  whereas only a fraction of the virus genome was detectable in the aae <dig> epithelia, indicative of its integration into the host genome. furthermore, in the case of epe <dig>  no human-viral junction reads were detected while the integrated aae <dig> viral genome was truncated and several human-viral junction reads were identified in aae <dig> epithelia. the integrated viral sequence was from nt  <dig>  and nt  <dig>  and thus includes the e <dig> and e <dig> oncogenes. precisely, the insertion of the hpv <dig> aae <dig> variant occurred between the nt position  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> of chromosome  <dig>  mechanistically, this is a simple “end-out” integration event with a typical two junction, co-linear  signature  <cit> , associated with a very short 11 bp deletion of the host genome, and two overlapping nucleotides between viral and human sequence at each junction . functionally, the insertion occurred within the 5q <dig> sub-band region, and more precisely, within the first intron of the slc26a <dig> gene, approximately 13 kb upstream of its third exon.fig.  <dig> characterization of viral integration and viral-human fusion transcripts in aae <dig> epithelia. a integration site schematic showing viral and human junctions, including nucleotide positions, the early promotor, as well as viral-human fusion transcript between hpv <dig> early region and slc26a <dig> exon  <dig>  a coverage plot above the integrated hpv <dig> genome demonstrates coverage across the junction sites within slc26a <dig> , while a circular coverage plot on the right shows the full episomal assembly of the epe <dig> episomal form. b immunofluorescence overlays of epe <dig> and aae <dig> raft cultures . nuclei are indicated by blue dapi staining while slc26a <dig> is indicated by red fluorescence




based on the dr.vis  v <dig>  database of hpv <dig> integration sites  <cit> , this exact region  of integration is not frequent, but potentially recurrent as it was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> previously documented sites. the nearest fragile site was 13 mb upstream of this integration site: fra5c, 5q <dig> . since repeated regions might be prone to genome rearrangements and therefore prone to hpv integration, we scanned the adjacent regions using the ucsc hg <dig> genome browser repeatmasker track for human repeat elements and found a nearby 158 bp long interspersed nuclear element : l1mb <dig> located from chr <dig> nt position  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  indeed, l1mb5-derived sequences have been documented as breakpoints, such as in the human genes hprt  <cit> , cyp2c  <cit> , and in proximity of genes containing the ubiquitin ligase mib-herc <dig> domain, which mediates notch signalling  <cit> . strikingly, this domain contains the hect region, homologous to the e6-associated protein carboxyl terminus, raising the question of whether or not the underlying homology could play a role in this target site selection. another, non-exclusive hypothesis is that the frequent hypo-methylation of line elements plays a role to facilitate access to the chromosomal dna and associated genomic instability  <cit> . altogether, our three-dimensional organotypic cultures demonstrated that the hpv <dig> aae <dig> variant had integrated into the host genome while the epe <dig> variant remained episomal, suggesting an increased propensity towards integration due to aae <dig>  a previous study of hpv <dig> integration propensity with respect to the variants did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference  between epe <dig>  and the e-t350g variant   <cit> . only one tumour sample in their set contained the aa variant, therefore precluding a formal analysis of its propensity to integrate, but notably it was in integrated form.

the hpv <dig> aae <dig> epithelium has a unique transcriptional profile
another essential feature that may differentiate the behaviour of the hpv <dig> epe <dig> and aae <dig> variants is expression of the viral genome, viral-human fusion transcripts when integrated, as well as downstream host effects due to expression of the e6/e <dig> oncogenes. to assess these, we performed a genome-wide rna-seq analysis of the epe <dig> and aae <dig> epithelia using illumina sequencing of total rnas , mapping first against our reference hpv <dig> w12e genome . viral transcriptomes were visualized with the integrative genomics viewer   <cit> , while viral gene counts and variant calls were performed using samtools  <cit> . the average sequencing depth of  <dig>  million total reads per sample  was appropriate to detect the small proportion of total reads of both hpv variant genomes , while none were detected in the hpv-negative control epithelium. the variant-specific non-synonymous snps  present in epe <dig>  and aae <dig>  were confirmed with depth of reads of 6× for epe <dig> and with 14× to ~300× depth of reads for aae <dig>  among the epe <dig> epithelial samples, we detected few e <dig>  e6*i , e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e1^e <dig>  and e <dig> transcripts, with even fewer l <dig> and l <dig> reads, as confirmed by l <dig> rt-qpcr and l <dig> protein immunohistochemistry results from the same independent set of rafts reported previously  <cit> . among the three individual epithelial raft cultures for epe <dig> samples the viral transcriptional landscape appeared similar but the read coverage was higher in raft # <dig> due to an overall higher abundance of viral transcripts in this sample . in contrast, the transcriptional landscape for the three aae <dig> samples was more homogenous , further emphasized in a clustered heatmap . abundant full-length e <dig>  e6*i, e <dig>  and only truncated e <dig> and l <dig> transcripts were detected. full-length e <dig>  e <dig>  e1^e <dig>  and l <dig> reads were absent in aae <dig> epithelia, consistent with the capt-hpv data reported above and our previous rt-qpcr results and dna copy number analyses on these molecules  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the hpv <dig> transcriptome in epe <dig> and aae <dig> organotypic rafts. a linear viral gene map. viral refseq  alignment from each individual raft culture was visualized using igv  <cit> . the y-axis  is log <dig> scaled. total number of viral reads are given on the right-hand side of each track. b heatmap & clustering analysis of viral transcriptome on deseq normalized counts: viral genes vs sample replicates. two distinct sample clusters matched epe <dig> and aae <dig> replicates respectively, clustering independently of each other. within the high-variability epe <dig> cluster, replicate  <dig> and  <dig> were clustered together. within the low-variability aae <dig> cluster, replicate  <dig> and  <dig> were clustered together. as well, aae <dig> epithelia converged on consistently high viral transcription . from the viral gene perspective, two distinct clusters were identified: e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and l <dig> in one, and e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and l <dig> in another. within the first primary cluster, e <dig> and e <dig> cluster close together, as expected given they are expressed together as a multi-cistronic transcript. e <dig> and l <dig> also cluster together, constituting the truncated transcripts on the periphery of the non-transcribed region within aae <dig> samples. in the second primary cluster, e <dig> and l <dig> cluster together, independent of e <dig> and e <dig> which is transcribed only in epe <dig> samples. e <dig> and e <dig> expression unsurprisingly clusters together given that e <dig> is contained within the e <dig> orf. c scatterplot of average viral gene expression for epe <dig> samples  and aae <dig> samples . the axes  are log <dig> scaled. significant differential gene expression is denoted by marker colour. dashed line represents equal expression




to quantitatively account for sample variance, we also performed differential expression analysis of the viral gene counts using deseq  <cit> . deseq software tests for differential expression in library size-corrected count data using a negative binomial distribution model. in agreement with our previous rt-qpcr results  <cit> , we found significantly more e <dig>  and e <dig>  counts in triplicate aae <dig> rafts in comparison to triplicate epe <dig> rafts . taken together, analyses of viral transcriptome data revealed that the aae <dig> viral transcriptome significantly differs from that of epe <dig> in a manner that is indicative of integration, with increased e <dig> and e <dig> levels . evidently, aae <dig> transcriptome profiles are lacking e <dig> and have increased e6/e <dig> oncogene expression, perhaps due to loss of transcriptional repression by e <dig>  we therefore reasoned that the increased levels of e6/e <dig> expression between the variants were ultimately due to their viral integration status, as we hypothesized in our phenotypic study, and confirmed by capt-hpv, leading to a significant effect on the host transcriptome  <cit> .

nature of viral-human fusion transcripts detected in hpv <dig> aae <dig> epithelium
the integration of hpv <dig> genomes into host chromosomes is a frequent phenomenon associated with carcinogenesis, and not only modifies the expression of hpv-encoded e <dig> and e <dig> oncogenes , but can also trigger the expression of fusion viral-human mrnas  <cit> . since the virus can integrate into a variety of positions in the human genome, these fusion transcripts are specific to each integration site. in recent years, following the introduction of high-throughput sequencing techniques, multiple softwares for detecting pathogen sequences in host sequence data have become available . here, to identify the viral-human fusion transcripts expressed in our epithelia, we used the viralfusionseq  software  <cit> . vfs was chosen over alternatives due to its optimization for rna-seq data from the illumina platform, the ability to define our own reference virus genome, as well as the full suite of fusion transcript discovery techniques it uses. using this technique, only the aae <dig> rafts yielded viral-human fusion transcripts , providing further evidence of viral integration as well as its transcriptional impact.table  <dig> integration loci detected by viralfusionseq

viral-human fusion transcripts were discovered using viralfusionseq’s  <cit> : clipped-sequence  and read-pair  modules. detected by at least  <dig> rp and cs event . as detected by cs method . vfs uses two methods to detect viral-human fusion transcripts. the clipped-seq  method detects viral fusion transcript breakpoints with a read that maps to both viral and human sequences, while the read-pair  analysis detects transcripts with read ends mapped separately to the viral and human genome  <cit> . we required candidate viral fusion transcripts to be supported by at least  <dig> cs and  <dig> rp event in order to improve its stringency  <cit> . although rp events were more abundant in our samples, cs analysis provided single-base resolution of viral-human fusion transcript breakpoints. in particular, we identified an average of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  cs transcripts in epe <dig> and  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  in aae <dig>  we detected no rp transcripts in epe <dig>  while  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  were found in aae <dig> rafts. while one rp transcript was detected in a niks control culture, this read was not confirmed by the cs method of vfs and therefore not considered as a valid event




in accordance with the structure of the hpv integration, the transcript breakpoints mapped to either the e <dig> or l <dig> hpv <dig> orf. alternative splicing was detected with the viral nucleotide position at the fusion site of one class of the viral-human fusion transcripts : nt  <dig>  in the e <dig> gene  <cit> . this is the same sd site for the e1^e <dig> splice transcript typically expressed in the late stage of the viral life cycle  <cit> , and previously shown to be expressed in our epe <dig> epithelia  <cit> . hpv <dig> viral-human fusion transcripts are often detected with a breakpoint at this natural splice donor site  <cit> , and the coverage plot for aae <dig> shows decreased coverage for transcripts downstream of this e <dig> sd site, supporting the hypothesis of alternative splicing. with respect to the l <dig> breakpoints, the typical l <dig> splice acceptor  site is at nt  <dig>  <cit> , but notably in our study, the viral-human fusion transcripts here had a putative downstream sa site at nt  <dig>  interestingly, the coverage plot of the viral transcriptome shows nt  <dig> as the site where l <dig> coverage begins to be detected in aae <dig> rafts , so we reasoned that this discrepancy in sa site could be due to either a cryptic sa site in the hpv <dig> w12e genome  or simply due to integration truncating the upstream region of l <dig> 

next, we mapped the human portion of the fusion transcripts using vfs’s clipped-seq  and read-pair  methods. confirmed by both these methods, two fusions mapped to the human chromosome location 5q <dig>  occurring within the solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig>  and phosphodiesterase 6a, cgmp-specific, rod, alpha  human orfs . strikingly, along with detection of fusion transcripts with these genes, we detected a significant increase in the expression of human genes from this region in aae <dig> epithelia compared to normal epithelia, namely slc26a <dig>  and colony-stimulating factor  <dig> receptor . this observation is in agreement with others who have found that, in numerous cervical carcinomas across multiple high-risk hpv types, hpv integration leads to an increase in the expression of genes adjacent to integration loci  <cit> . to explain the molecular basis of this cis-effect, it has been proposed to be the result of viral promotor-driven expression or somatic genome amplification at the integration site  <cit> . in the present case, this last hypothesis is unlikely because the aae <dig> integration produced a clean 11 bp deletion of the target region that led to two co-linear viral-human junctions , which is not associated with gene amplification  <cit> .

functional human fusion proteins can be formed due to chromosomal translocations in cancer cells  <cit> . the elucidation of novel protein-coding viral-human fusion transcripts is particularly intriguing due to their potentially functional roles within host cells. using immunofluorescence for the expressed portion of the slc26a <dig> protein in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded  rafts, we determined that slc26a <dig> protein expression was aberrantly high in aae <dig> compared to epe <dig>  supposedly as a result of its viral-human fusion and increased transcription . this translated fusion protein contains exon  <dig> of the transmembrane protein slc26a <dig>  previously known as diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter   <cit> , which encodes the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor  domain  <cit> . we cannot find any evidence in the literature of this unique viral-human fusion protein in other hpv-integrated samples. overall, these chimeric molecules are unique for each sample and to the specific integration site, with presently unknown effect on host cell functions, an aspect to be further researched due to its importance for understanding mechanisms of tumourigenesis as well as in the emerging field of personalized medicine.

the hpv <dig> aae <dig> epithelium reveals a signature of chromosomal instability conducive to host genome integration
integration of hpv dna into the host genome is considered to be a key factor for cervical cancer development  <cit> , but the cellular events that initiate the integration process  remain to be better understood. a reasonable hypothesis is that the integration is triggered by a rare and stochastic target site event, such as a replicative fork stalling or an accidental chromosome double-strand break, leading to an ultimate use of the viral dna for repair via recombination, template switching  and/or microhomology-mediated break-induced replication  . indeed, infections with pathogens can cause chromosomal instability by inactivating the host dna damage response  <cit> . for hpv, this has been linked to the expression of both hpv <dig> e <dig> and e <dig> oncoproteins, affecting the infected cell’s genome integrity . a model of early carcinogenesis due to hpv <dig> e <dig> and e <dig> suggests that this chromosomal instability is caused by uncontrolled proliferation, leading to an insufficient nucleotide pool that cannot support normal replication  <cit> . alternatively, e <dig> alone, through the inactivation of p <dig>  can promote chromosomal instability, at least during early onset of carcinogenesis  <cit> . presently, hpv <dig> aae <dig> demonstrated enhanced integration propensity over epe <dig> and exhibited increased e <dig> and e <dig> oncogene expression, which is in accordance with elevated e <dig> and e <dig> levels reported in other studies . this enhanced integration ability is based on aae6’s greater proliferation ability, leading to chromosomal instability. the underlying mechanism of its increased cell growth is the result of a deregulated sugar metabolism , as we reported previously  <cit>  and currently under study .

to assess the host chromosomal instability in our hpv <dig> variant epithelia, we examined our rna-seq data to detect the cin <dig> gene expression signature  <cit> , which has been applied as a prognostic marker in cervical cancer  <cit>  and more generally as a significant indicator to predict clinical outcome across multiple cancer types  <cit> . this signature is derived from  <dig> gene expression datasets . the cin <dig> score relative to hpv-negative niks was significantly higher in aae <dig> compared to epe <dig> epithelia , indicating a signature of host chromosomal instability in aae <dig> epithelia . furthermore, as a morphological sign of chromosomal instability, we detected micronuclei  in aae <dig> but not epe <dig> or niks ffpe h&e-stained epithelia . mn were reported to be present in higher grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions and invasive cervical cancer  <cit>  and mechanistically have been associated with hallmarks of genomic instability  <cit> .fig.  <dig> chromosomal instability signature and micronuclei in aae <dig> epithelia. a the cin <dig> score relative to hpv-negative niks was significantly higher in aae <dig> compared to epe <dig> epithelia . mean values are shown with error bars representing standard deviation . statistical significance  denoted by “*”. b haematoxylin and eosin micrographs of ffpe aae <dig> epithelia, 400× cropped, micronuclei indicated by arrow. close-up shows micronucleus and normal-sized nucleus within same cell




hpv <dig> aae <dig> epithelium exhibits a proliferating phenotype as a consequence of viral integration into the host genome
more broadly, our rna-seq data led us to examine global changes in host gene expression. our previous study demonstrated enhanced tumourigenesis by the full hpv <dig> genome with aae <dig>  <cit> , while another study presented altered gene expression by the aa variant  <cit> . work by other groups have studied the downstream pathways in the aa variant  <cit> , and have utilized high-throughput techniques to investigate genetic variation within hpv <dig>  <cit> , but this is the first study investigating the downstream pathways affected by the hpv <dig> variants in an organotypic epithelial model using next-generation sequencing. we hypothesized two scenarios that can be associated with these findings and analyzed in our present study: i) the global gene expression profile within aae6-infected epithelium would differ significantly from that of epe <dig> and ii) significant gene expression differences in the host due not only to the actions of the viral oncogenes e <dig> and e <dig>  but also as a result of integration  <cit> . a global “-omics” technique, rna-seq, was required to sufficiently address our hypotheses around the functional relevance of the aa variant in epithelia. we assessed host differential gene expression using deseq  <cit>  to determine how it reflected the unique viral gene expression profiles induced in human epithelium undergoing differentiation. strikingly, niks, which contain no virus genome, had zero significant differentially expressed genes compared to epe <dig>  at a false-discovery rate  of 10 % . niks to aae <dig> had  <dig> significant differentially expressed genes . of these genes,  <dig> were down-regulated while  <dig> were up-regulated in aae <dig> compared to niks. the lack of any differentially expressed genes between niks and epe <dig> organotypic epithelial cultures was surprising, but consistent with the similarity between the niks and epe <dig> cultures monitored with respect to basal and suprabasal keratinocyte proliferation assessed by brdu-incorporation, p <dig> and p16ink4a by immunohistochemistry and ifn-κ by rt-qpcr  <cit> . phenotypically, these results suggest that the episomal expression of the epe <dig> variant in our model does not have a significant tumourigenic effect. since our 3d culture model specifically captures early tumourigenesis, with only a 2-week growth period and low initial viral copy number, very small gene expression differences in a homogenized epidermal sample are not expected to be easily detected with global transcriptomic techniques. on the other hand, aae <dig> significantly perturbed a high number of human genes, demonstrating its ability to cause a wide-range of host molecular changes consistent with tumourigenesis. compared to epe <dig>  aae <dig> had  <dig> significant differentially expressed genes . of these genes,  <dig> were down-regulated while  <dig> were up-regulated in aae <dig> compared to epe <dig>  additional discussion of the top-ten most significant down- and up-regulated genes for each pair-wise comparison is provided in additional file  <dig>  to further investigate the differential gene expression data we applied two additional bioinformatics analyses: gene ontology  biological process term enrichment , as well as co-expression analysis and visualization using networks . finally, we also compared the pair-wise lists of differentially expressed genes to determine the number of common and unique genes among each set :  <dig> genes unique to the niks comparison,  <dig> unique to the epe <dig> comparison, and  <dig> common between them. overall, these bioinformatics analyses highlight the global effects of aae <dig> on host epithelia due to its integration event, increased e6/e <dig> expression, and perhaps in part functional differences due to the aae <dig> oncoprotein itself: increased proliferation and decreased differentiation.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  terms enriched in highly significant differentially expressed genes in aae <dig> vs. niks. the term enrichment service available on the amigo  <dig> website  <cit>  was used to determine enriched go  terms among  down-regulated and  up-regulated genes. only the top ten go terms are shown for each. see additional file  <dig> for discussion

CONCLUSIONS
we have systematically characterized the viral integration process of a common high-risk hpv <dig> variant and its consequences for the affected host cell. this and earlier work lend themselves to propose a model of increased tumourigenicity in human keratinocyte epithelia where aae6’s enhanced ability to proliferate leads to chromosomal instability. in such an environment, the host genome may be susceptible to viral integration subsequently increasing e6/e <dig> oncogene expression and ultimately driving additional tumourigenic changes. previously, we performed phenotypic studies of the epe <dig> and aae <dig> variants in a 3d raft model of early carcinogenesis  <cit>  and determined the functional differences of these variants in longitudinal monolayer cell cultures . while necessary for studying the viral life cycle, limitations of the current organotypic model are the lack of immune components, vasculature, and the complexity of tissue heterogeneity that arises. our current study builds on the foundation of these investigations. we have applied a wide range of molecular analyses, creating a framework which can benefit future virus-host interaction studies with various organotypic cell culture models. a variant-specific integration is worth reporting and should be further investigated, with additional samples from independent donors, as it represents a new paradigm in hpv variant biology. here we report a viable integration mechanism in a robust viral life cycle model for aae <dig>  the findings of the current and other studies reported by us , and others , are consistent with cancer epidemiology studies demonstrating that the hpv <dig> aa variant is a higher risk factor for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and progression to invasive cervical cancer . in the future, hpv variant genotyping could be used as a clinical prognostic factor for patient-centered health services, while the role of individual host genomics on integration, including characterization of integration sites, will be important to consider for personalized medicine approaches.
