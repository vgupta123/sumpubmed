BACKGROUND
calcium, as a second messenger, plays important roles in a variety of signal transduction pathways. several classes of calcium-sensing proteins, including calcium-dependent protein kinases , calcineurin b-like  proteins, and calmodulin , have been characterized in plants
 <cit> . cdpks activated by ca2+ and modulate downstream targets of calcium signaling in plants
 <cit> . cdpks participate in stress signaling transduction pathways through either stimulus-dependent activation or directed functional target protein phosphorylation
 <cit> .

genome-wide analyses have identified  <dig> cdpk genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> . some arabidopsis cdpks have been reported to be involved in abiotic stress responses and abscisic acid  signaling. loss-of-function mutants of cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> showed decreased tolerance to salt and drought stresses, and aba-insensitive phenotypes for seed germination, seedling growth, and stomatal movement. cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> phosphorylate two aba-responsive transcription factors, abf <dig> and abf <dig> to mediate the aba signaling pathway
 <cit> . cpk6-overexpressing plants showed enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses and cpk <dig> mutants exhibited a salt-sensitive phenotype
 <cit> . cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> also function in controlling of aba-regulated stomatal signaling and guard cell ion channels. aba-induced stomatal closure was partially impaired in a cpk3/cpk <dig> mutant
 <cit> . cpk <dig> activates the slow anion channel  and cpk <dig> activates slac <dig> as well as its guard cell homolog slah <dig>  these activations are calcium-dependent and are controlled by the aba signaling component phosphatase abi1
 <cit> . cpk <dig> phosphorylates the aba-responsive transcription factor abf <dig> in vitro, and cpk32-overexpressing plants displayed increased sensitivity to aba during seeds germination as a result of up-regulated expressions of genes controlled by abf4
 <cit> . cpk10-overexpression and t-dna insertion mutant analyses have shown that cpk <dig> is involved in drought stress tolerance. moreover, cpk <dig>  through its interaction with heat shock protein  <dig> , plays a role in aba- and ca2+-mediated regulation of stomatal movement
 <cit> . together, these studies have shown that arabidopsis cpk family members can positively regulate abiotic stress tolerance and aba signaling.

however, arabidopsis cpk23-overexpressing lines showed a drought- and salt-sensitive phenotype and increased stomatal aperture. accordingly, cpk <dig> mutants showed improved tolerance to drought and salt stresses and reduced stomatal aperture
 <cit> . arabidopsis seedlings with a loss-of-function of cpk <dig> also showed increased tolerance to hyperosmotic stress
 <cit> . cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> were shown to control the activation state of slac <dig> in ca2+-independent manner
 <cit> . arabidopsis cpk12-rnai lines were hypersensitive to aba during seed germination and root elongation
 <cit> . the results of these studies suggested that some arabidopsis cpks function as negative regulators of abiotic stress tolerance and aba signaling. therefore, the experimental evidences indicate that cdpk-mediated abiotic stress and aba responses are complex in arabidopsis.

although  <dig> cdpk genes have been identified in the rice genome
 <cit> , the functions of only a few have been explored so far. for example, oscdpk7-overexpressing plants exhibited increased resistance to cold, drought, and salinity stresses
 <cit> . oscpk <dig> was shown to be involved in increasing aba sensitivity and conferring salt stress tolerance. compared with wild-type, oscpk21-overexpressing plants showed a higher survival rate under salt stress and a stronger inhibition of seedling growth by aba
 <cit> . oscpk <dig> overexpression and oscpk <dig> rna interference analyses revealed that oscpk <dig> positively regulates rice tolerance to salt stress by controlling the expression of osapx <dig>  osapx <dig> and osrbohi. moreover, oscpk12-overexpressing lines showed increased sensitivity to aba and enhanced susceptibility to blast fungus, probably because of decreased production of reactive oxygen species and/or the involvement of oscpk <dig> in the aba signaling pathway
 <cit> .

the calcium-dependent seed-specific protein kinase  is a key regulator of seed development. spk is involved in regulating the metabolic pathway responsible for the conversion of sucrose into storage starch in immature seeds
 <cit> . oscdpk <dig> negatively regulates the expressions of enzymes required for ga biosynthesis and seed size, but positively regulates drought stress tolerance through the14-3- <dig> protein
 <cit> . however, it is unclear whether cdpks play a role in regulating spikelet fertility. spikelet fertility that is affected by anther dehiscence, pollen production and the number of germinating pollen grains on the stigma is an important component of yield
 <cit> . in the present research, oscpk <dig> overexpression  and interference  analyses indicate that oscpk <dig> positively regulates abiotic stress tolerance, spikelet fertility, and aba sensitivity. these findings contribute to our understanding of cdpk-mediated abiotic stress responses and aba signaling, and will be useful for improving the stress tolerance and quality of rice.

RESULTS
expression patterns of oscpk <dig> in rice
to investigate the oscpk <dig> expression patterns in different rice organs, we conducted quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  analyses using mrna isolated from various organs as the templates. oscpk <dig> transcripts present in all organs tested including the root, basal part, stem, leaf blade, anther, and spikelet, with higher transcript levels in the leaf blade and stem than in other organs . to detect the transcriptional response of oscpk <dig> to abiotic stresses and aba, various treatments were applied to rice plants. after aba treatment, the expression of oscpk <dig> increased at 1 h and reached the highest level at 3 h followed by a decrease . oscpk <dig> transcription was also induced to the highest level at 5 h and 2 h after nacl and peg <dig> treatments respectively . therefore, oscpk <dig> transcription was up-regulated by aba, nacl, and peg <dig> treatments in comparison to control, implying its function in the responses to abiotic stresses and aba.

generation of oscpk <dig> transgenic rice lines
to further study the function of oscpk <dig> in planta, we generated oscpk9-ox  and oscpk9-rnai  transgenic lines. the rt-pcr results showed that the transcript levels of oscpk <dig> were markedly higher in oscpk9-ox lines than in wild type  with the highest transcriptional levels of oscpk <dig> in oe <dig> . in contrast, the transcript levels of oscpk <dig> were reduced in oscpk9-rnai lines, with the lowest transcript levels of oscpk <dig> in ri <dig> . we detected the intron sequence introduced into the construct, confirming the presence of the construct in oscpk9-rnai lines . these results confirmed that oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai transgenic lines were successfully produced.

oscpk <dig> increases plants’ tolerance to drought, osmotic, and dehydration stresses
to investigate the drought stress tolerance of oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines, 3-week-old rice seedlings were subjected to a drought treatment. after  <dig> or 27 days of drought, oscpk9-ox lines grew well. in contrast, the growth of the oscpk9-rnai lines was inhibited compared with that of control . after 27 days of drought and 3 days of recovery, the survival rates of oscpk9-ox lines oe <dig> and oe <dig>  were higher than that of wt , while oscpk9-rnai lines ri <dig> and ri <dig> showed very low survival rates  . although there were no significant differences in chlorophyll and malondialdehyde  contents between controls and transgenic lines under normal growth conditions, clear differences were observed between control and transgenic lines after the drought treatment. the chlorophyll content was higher in oscpk9-ox lines, but lower in oscpk9-rnai lines compared with that in the control after drought treatment . the mda content was lower in oscpk9-ox lines, but higher in oscpk9-rnai lines, compared with that in the control after drought treatment . these results indicated that oscpk <dig> plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance.

to determine the osmotic stress tolerance of oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines, 2-week-old rice seedlings were treated with 20% peg <dig> for 8 h and followed with  <dig>   <dig>  or 7 days of recovery. at different treatment stages, the oscpk9-ox lines showed better growth than that of controls, and the oscpk9-rnai lines showed worse growth . after the 8 h osmotic treatment, oscpk9-ox plants showed a lower mda content and higher soluble sugars and proline contents, while oscpk9-rnai plants showed a higher mda content and lower soluble sugars and proline contents, compared with those of wild type  and the vector control  . after 7 days of recovery, compared with controls, oscpk9-ox plants had higher biomass, reflected by longer roots and shoots, greater fresh weight, less wilted leaves, and more green leaves. in contrast, the biomass of oscpk9-rnai plants was lower than that of control plants . these analyses of physiological indices confirmed that osmotic stress tolerance is increased in oscpk9-ox lines and decreased in oscpk9-rnai lines.

to analyze the dehydration stress tolerance of oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines, 2-week-old rice seedlings were exposed to air. oscpk9-ox lines tolerated a 5 h dehydration treatment . after a 10 days recovery, oscpk9-ox lines grew more robustly than did wt and vc, as reflected by their longer roots and shoots and greater fresh weight . these results indicated that oscpk9-ox plants have increased tolerance to dehydration stress.

oscpk <dig> functions in water retention by increasing proline and soluble sugars contents and improving stomatal closure under drought stress
plants with high capacity for water retention can better survive drought or dehydration stress. during  <dig> to 25 hours of a dehydration treatment, oscpk9-ox lines retained a high relative water content  and showed a low water loss rate , while oscpk9-rnai lines had lower rwc and higher wlr compared with those of wt and vc . these results indicated that oscpk <dig> plays a positive role in improving the ability of the plant to retain water under dehydration conditions.

osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure are the main physiological mechanisms to reduce water loss under dehydration or drought conditions in plants. to elucidate the physiological mechanism by which oscpk <dig> confers tolerance to drought and dehydration stresses and improves the ability of plant to retain water, we quantified osmolytes  in oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines. under normal growth conditions, there were no significant differences between controls and transgenic lines in terms of their proline and soluble sugars contents . under drought conditions, oscpk9-ox lines accumulated larger amounts of proline and soluble sugars, but oscpk9-rnai lines accumulated smaller amounts of proline and soluble sugars, compared with those in controls . additionally, the status of stomata was observed and counted in controls and transgenic lines. under normal growth conditions, there were no significant differences in stomatal status between controls and transgenic lines. after the drought treatment, 35% and 37% of stomata were completely closed in wt and vc plants, respectively, while greater proportions of stomata were closed in oscpk9-ox lines . accordingly, there were smaller proportions of completely opened stomata in oscpk9-ox lines, but larger proportions in oscpk9-rnai lines . there was a slightly lower proportion of partially opened stomata in oscpk9-rnai lines than in controls. these results indicated that oscpk <dig> affects osmotic balance and stomatal movement under drought conditions.

oscpk <dig> improves pollen maturation and spikelet fertility under normal conditions
we harvested and analyzed spikelets to evaluate the grain development in the transgenic lines under normal conditions. spikelet weight is  <dig>  g and spikelet fertility is  <dig> % in wt rice plants. oscpk9-ox lines had greater spikelet weight  and spikelet fertility , compared with those of controls. in contrast, the spikelets of oscpk9-rnai lines were less fertile  and had a smaller spikelet weight  than those of wt and vc lines. there was no obvious difference in grain length and width between wt and transgenic lines . therefore, spikelet weight and spikelet fertility of rice were correlated with the expression of oscpk <dig>  because the number of mature pollen is an important impact factor of spikelet fertility, we further investigate pollen status of control plants and transgenic lines using i2-ki staining. the results indicated that oscpk9-ox lines had a higher mature pollen staining ratio, while oscpk9-rnai lines had a lower ratio than those of wt and vc . mature pollen staining ratio reflects pollen viability. the mature pollen staining ratio correlated with the expression of oscpk <dig> suggested that oscpk <dig> functions in increasing pollen viability. collectively, these results indicated that oscpk <dig> enhances spikelet fertility by regulating pollen maturation.

responses of oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines to aba
to explore whether oscpk <dig> is involved in the aba signaling response, oscpk9-ox and oscpk9-rnai lines were treated with exogenous aba. under 1 μm aba treatment, oscpk9-ox lines showed shorter roots and shoots and lower root and shoot dry weights than those of wt and vc . although seedlings growth of control and transgenic plants was inhibited by a 3 μm aba treatment, it was more strongly inhibited in oscpk9-ox plants than in wt and vc plants . the 3 μm aba treatment had a stronger negative effect on root length, shoot length, and root and shoot dry weights of oscpk9-ox plants than on those parameters in wt and vc plants . conversely, aba did not significantly affect seedling growth and root elongation of oscpk9-rnai lines, compared with that of control plants after aba treatment. these results confirmed that oscpk9-ox lines are more sensitive to aba than wt and vc.

oscpk <dig> regulates aba- and stress-responsive genes under osmotic stress and aba treatment
to gain a deeper understanding of oscpk <dig> function in osmotic stress tolerance and the aba response, we analyzed the transcript levels of some selected aba- and stress-responsive genes by qrt-pcr analysis in control and transgenic lines under normal conditions, osmotic stress, and aba treatment . the following genes were selected for analysis: rab <dig>  which encodes a basic glycine-rich protein
 <cit> ; oslea <dig>  encoding a late embryogenesis abundant protein
 <cit> ; osp5cs, encoding Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase, which is involved in proline biosynthesis
 <cit> ; osnac <dig>  osnac <dig> and osnac <dig>  which encode nac-type transcription factors
 <cit> ; osrsus, encoding sucrose synthase
 <cit>  and osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig>  which encode abf-type transcription factors
 <cit> . under normal conditions, the transcript levels of osnac <dig> were higher in oscpk9-ox lines and lower in oscpk9-rnai lines, compared with that in wt. the transcript levels of oslea <dig>  rab <dig>  osrsus, and osp5cs were higher in oscpk9-ox lines than in wt and vc. after aba treatment, the transcript levels of rab <dig>  osbzip <dig>  osnac <dig>  and osrsus were higher in oscpk9-ox but lower in oscpk9-rnai lines, compared with their respective levels in wt and vc. the transcript levels of osbzip <dig>  oslea <dig>  osp5cs, osnac <dig> and osbzip <dig> were higher in oscpk9-ox than in wt and vc. under peg <dig> treatment, the transcript levels of all of the selected genes except for osnac <dig> and osnac <dig> were higher in oscpk9-ox plants than in the control. the transcript levels of the tested genes were confirmed by rt-pcr, and the results were generally consistent with those detected by qrt-pcr analysis . these results suggested that oscpk <dig> expression affects the transcription of aba- and stress-associated genes.

discussion
oscpk <dig> plays a positive role in drought, osmotic, and dehydration stress responses
oscpk <dig> belongs to the group iii-b cdpk family
 <cit> . the oscpk <dig> gene contains five exons and four introns. the oscpk <dig> protein is composed of  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted relative molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. it has a protein kinase domain, a calmodulin-like domain with four conserved ef-hand motifs, an autoinhibitory junction domain, and an n-terminal variable region
 <cit> . it also has potential n-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation sites
 <cit> . previously, oscpk <dig> expression in response to abiotic stresses was examined using a cdna microarray. the results showed that oscpk <dig> was induced by salt and desiccation treatments
 <cit> . in this study, oscpk <dig> transcription was induced by a peg <dig> treatment, implying that oscpk <dig> also functions in the osmotic stress response . to assess the role of oscpk <dig> under drought conditions, we engineered rice lines in which oscpk <dig> was overexpressed or knocked down. our results suggested that oscpk <dig> is a positive regulator of the responses to drought, osmotic, and dehydration stresses . these results are consistent with those of previous studies on some other cdpk genes that positively regulate drought stress tolerance
 <cit> .

oscpk <dig> confers tolerance to drought stress by improving osmotic adjustment and stomatal movement
the ability to retain water is crucial for plants to combat drought. our results show that oscpk <dig> is involved in maintaining the ability of plants to retain water, and hence, it confers drought stress tolerance . we further explored the physiological mechanism by which oscpk <dig> enables the plant to retain water. when water is limiting, plants accumulate compatible osmolytes such as soluble sugars and proline to decrease the cellular osmotic potential
 <cit> . our results showed that there were increased contents of both soluble sugars and proline in oscpk9-ox lines, but decreased contents of these substances in oscpk9-rnai lines . thus, oscpk <dig> functions in osmotic adjustment, improving the ability of the plant to retain water during drought. also, stomatal movement controls not only co <dig> uptake but also water loss to the atmosphere, thereby playing important roles in drought tolerance of crops
 <cit> . some cdpks play vital roles in regulating stomatal movement. for example, overexpression of zmcpk <dig> resulted in increased aba-mediated stomatal closure
 <cit> . aba- and ca2+-induced stomatal closure were partially impaired in a cpk3cpk <dig> mutant
 <cit> . the arabidopsis cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> genes were shown to be involved in aba-regulated stomatal closure
 <cit> . in the present study, oscpk9-ox lines showed a significantly higher proportion of completely closed stomata under drought treatment, which may contribute to reduced water loss . these results provided physiological evidence that oscpk <dig> confers drought stress tolerance by enhancing the osmotic adjustment ability of the plant and by promoting stomatal closure, thereby reducing water loss.

oscpk <dig> regulates expression of stress-associated genes in response to drought
to gain a deeper understanding of the function of oscpk <dig> under abiotic stresses, we analyzed the transcript levels of some stress-inducible genes. under osmotic stress, the transcript levels of rab <dig>  osp5cs, oslea <dig>  osnac <dig>  osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> were higher in oscpk9-ox lines than in wt and vc . in previous studies, rab <dig> was shown to be induced by water stress, and overexpression of osp5cs, oslea <dig>  osnac <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses
 <cit> . it was also reported that transcript levels of some stress-responsive genes were higher in other oscpk-overexpressing rice lines than in controls under abiotic stresses. the transcript levels of oslea <dig>  osp5cs, osbzip <dig>  and osnac <dig> were higher in oscpk21-fox and oscpk13-fox plants than in wt plants under salt stress
 <cit> . similarly, oscdpk7-overexpressing plants showed increased transcription of oslea <dig> in roots after a salt treatment
 <cit> . these results demonstrated that oscpk <dig> is involved in increasing transcription of stress-associated genes, thereby improving tolerance to drought stress.

oscpk <dig> is involved in spikelet fertility
in a previous study, an analysis of cdpk gene family members revealed that transcripts for  <dig> genes deferentially accumulated during reproductive developmental stages
 <cit> . in maize, a pollen-specific cdpk was only transcribed at the late stages of pollen development
 <cit> . in petunia, picdpk <dig> and picdpk <dig> were involved in divergently regulating pollen tube growth. picdpk <dig> played an important role in growth polarity, whereas picdpk <dig> functioned in pollen tube extension
 <cit> . these studies demonstrated that cdpks function as important calcium sensors in pollen tube growth and seed development. however, it remained unknown whether cdpks play a role in spikelet fertility. we detected oscpk <dig> transcript not only in vegetative organs, but also in two reproductive organs, anther and spikelet . further investigations suggested that oscpk <dig> plays a role in increasing spikelet fertility . pollen viability reflected by mature pollen staining ratio plays an important role in spikelet fertility
 <cit> . the mature pollen staining ratio determined by i2-ki staining was correlated with the expression of oscpk <dig>  indicating that oscpk <dig> positively regulates starch accumulation, pollen viability, and hence increases spikelet fertility . the formation of mature and fertile pollen grains, taking place inside the anther, depends on supply of assimilates, in the form of sucrose, provided mainly by the leaves
 <cit> . starch biosynthesis during the final phases of pollen maturation is critical not only because starch provides a source of energy for pollen germination, but also because it is a checkpoint of pollen maturity
 <cit> . the absence of starch deposition is a remarkable phenotype in male-sterile pollen
 <cit> . upregulation of osrsus in leaves of oscpk9-overexpressing rice plants may increase sucrose supply to pollen for starch accumulation, therefore contributes to improved pollen viability and spikelet fertility . whether oscpk <dig> could directly influence starch accumulation in pollen needs further investigation.

oscpk <dig> possibly acts in an aba-dependent manner
it is well established that the phytohormone aba maintains seed dormancy and inhibits seed germination and seedling growth
 <cit> . drought induces aba biosynthesis and triggers aba-dependent signaling pathways
 <cit> . thus, we investigated the oscpk <dig> response to aba. the oscpk9-overexpressing lines were more sensitive to aba than wt and vc . arabidopsis cdpks are involved in aba signaling by phosphorylating basic leucine zipper class transcription factor proteins . arabidopsis cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> phosphorylate two bzip factors, abf <dig> and abf4
 <cit> . consistently, arabidopsis cpk <dig> interacts with abf <dig> and phosphorylates it in vitro <cit> . moreover, cpk <dig>  cpk <dig>  and cpk <dig> are involved in aba-regulated physiological processes and abiotic stress tolerance
 <cit> . additionally, osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> function in aba signaling and/or abiotic stress tolerance
 <cit> . the transcript levels of osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> increased in oscpk9-ox lines under osmotic and aba treatments . oscpk <dig> may function with osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> to mediate aba signaling and abiotic stress responses. furthermore, our results showed that oscpk <dig> plays a positive role in regulating rab <dig>  osnac <dig>  oslea <dig>  and osp5cs transcription under osmotic stress and aba treatment . these genes are responsive to abiotic stresses and aba signaling
 <cit> . therefore, the increased aba sensitivity and higher transcript levels of aba- and stress-responsive genes in oscpk9-ox rice lines indicate that oscpk <dig> positively regulates abiotic stress tolerance in an aba-dependent manner.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized the function of oscpk <dig>  a rice cdpk gene. oscpk <dig> overexpression and interference analyses revealed that oscpk <dig> positively regulates drought stress tolerance by enhancing stomatal closure and the osmotic adjustment ability of the plant. oscpk <dig> also improves pollen viability, thereby increasing spikelet fertility. the oscpk9-ox rice lines exhibited increased sensitivity to aba. these findings help to clarify details of the cdpk-mediated abiotic stress responses and the role of aba signaling in improving stress tolerance and rice quality. in the future, identifying the direct targets of oscpk <dig> would be useful to determine the molecular mechanism of cdpks.
