BACKGROUND
intramuscular fat deposition in cattle starts to become visible at  <dig> months of age and the rate of deposition increases from  <dig> months to  <dig> months  <cit> . the initial formation of visible intramuscular fat seems to be driven through the development of adipocytes in combination with declining muscle growth  <cit> . it has been shown that marbling fat content is negatively correlated with protein content in beef muscle  <cit> . in addition the development of adipose tissues in longissimus muscle of high-marbled cattle appears to disorganize the structure of the intramuscular connective tissue during growth  <cit> . this suggests that there might be an interaction between fat development and collagen structure in muscle. kokta et al  <cit>  reviewed the interaction between myogenic cells and adipocytes to determine the rate and extent of myogenesis and adipogenesis during animal growth. fat and muscle development are regulated by a number of complicated biological pathways which are related to adenoreceptor signaling  <cit> , the cytokine signaling pathway  <cit>  and a wide range of hormonal and transcriptional factors such as leptin  <cit> , adiponectin  <cit>  and insulin like growth factor protein families  <cit> . as such, this interaction between muscle and fat also reflects a biochemical signaling pathway within the muscle. therefore, marbling differences might be a function of a series of complex interactions between biological pathways  <cit> .

the completion of the bovine genome project provided a tool for genome-wide functional studies to understand the interactions of complex biochemical pathways involved in protein and fat synthesis. for example, affymetrix produces an oligonucleotide bovine genome array that allows genome wide global profiling of over  <dig>  bovine transcripts simultaneously microarray based gene expression analyses associated with beef meat quality have focused on detecting differentially expressed genes in different breeds  <cit>  and different nutritional treatments  <cit> . however, there is no report on gene expression differences in muscle with divergent marbling phenotypes within breed  <cit> .

here we report the results of a study undertaken to identify the biochemical differences in m. longissimus with divergent marbling phenotypes. the objective of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and their role in a signaling pathway in m. longissimus with a wide range of marbling phenotypes.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes between high and low marbling muscle
to detect the relationship between differentially expressed genes with marbling score, samples from m. longissimus were taken from ten unrelated animals with the highest and lowest marbling score. it was recognized that given the divergent nature of the animals the relationship would be inflated above that found in a normally sampled population.

a moderated t-test using limma  was used to explore genes differentially expressed between high and low marbled animals in m. longissimus., we found  <dig> differentially expressed genes between high and low-marbled muscle using three data processing methods: mas <dig>  , rma  and gcrma  .

twenty one genes showed significant differential expression  in at least two normalization methods . out of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes  listed in table  <dig>  eight differentially expressed genes were identified as up-regulated in muscle with high intramuscular fat content and the remaining  <dig> degs were down-regulated in samples with high intramuscular fat content. putative genes were assigned to  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs . the remaining  <dig> degs match gene sequences in bovine and other species with strong, moderate or weak sequence similarity but have no functional annotation assigned . based on the gene identities and associated functions, three up-regulated genes are involved in lipid metabolism  and muscle metabolism . three down-regulated genes  belong to functional classes involved in energy metabolism and an intracellular metabolic pathway. the remaining  <dig> degs are only hypothetical proteins or transcribed loci . out of these  <dig> degs, three hypothetical proteins  and two transcribed loci  could be worth pursuing further to elucidate their functional role in marbling. technical validation of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes from the microarray experiment was confirmed by real-time pcr. the correlation of fold changes in gene expression between the arrays and pcr is shown in figure  <dig>  the results demonstrate a consistent gene expression pattern between both methods.

1the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were selected from genes that were significant in at least  <dig> probe level summarization methods.

2fold changes are shown on a log <dig> scale. positive values show up regulation in high marbled animals and conversely, negative values show down regulation.

3p-value is set to p =  <dig>  in this study.

gene ontology  and pathway analysis
de genes were analyzed in the context of their go biological process. due to the incomplete annotation of the bovine genome, only  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially expressed probe sets were annotated. top ranking biological go terms are listed in table  <dig>  together with the genes associated to the go term.

the pathway studio v <dig>  program  was used to identify molecular connections between the proteins encoded by the  <dig> annotated differentially expressed genes. the program searches through the resnet database for all known interactions between genes/proteins such as physical interactions and regulation of expression . out of the  <dig> annotated genes,  <dig> main pathway "hubs"  were detected in the pathway analysis. the cyp51a and sqle proteins that are up-regulated in highly marbled muscle appear to be involved in steroid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism. in particular, cyp51a is activated by two proteins, sp <dig> and srebp <dig> which are common transcription factors in lipid metabolism. sh3kbp <dig> is involved in cell processes such as intracellular signaling cascade, oxidative stress and cell proliferation. in addition, the pathway analysis demonstrated that adamts <dig> is activated by immune responses related to single molecules  and transforming growth factor beta  <dig> . the results suggest a biological pathway connecting cyp51a, sqle and adamts <dig> that has not been previously identified in bovine gene expression studies on marbling fat.

gene expression of selected genes in the adamst <dig> pathway
go and pathway analysis showed that adamts <dig> is involved in protein catabolic process  and it is mainly activated by the immune related single molecules il-17a, tnfα and tgfβ <dig>  the adamts <dig> gene has a role in proteolysis degradation of the extracellular matrix  in muscle. marbling fat accumulates in the connective tissue matrix in close proximity to blood vessels. these findings suggest that adamts <dig> might be involved in a pathway associated to phenotypic differences of marbling fat in cattle.

to determine if any of the three regulators il-17a, tnfα and tgfβ <dig> were associated with the adamts <dig> pathway, we investigated gene expression of adamts <dig> and the three regulators  in muscle with divergent imf and protein content using rt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of adamts <dig> increases significantly as intramuscular fat content increases  and muscle protein content decreases . of the regulators only tgfβ <dig> significantly increased expression with increasing intramuscular fat content  and it tended to decrease with decreasing muscle protein content . in summary, tgfβ <dig> and adamst <dig> are highly associated with increases in marbling fat.

discussion
microarray analysis
a major objective of this study was to identify new biological indicators for marbling in cattle through global transcription profiling . identification of novel differentially expressed genes might allow a better understanding of the complex biochemical mechanisms of marbling in cattle. to date, microarray based gene expression analyses for beef meat quality  have focused on detecting differentially expressed genes in different breeds of cattle such as japanese black  and holstein friesian cattle for a wide range of marbling phenotypes  <cit> . as expected, many lipid metabolism related genes  were highly expressed in the japanese black. as pethick  <cit>  commented, visible intramuscular fat content is a late maturing trait in cattle. therefore, this study attempted to investigate genes that are differentially expressed in divergent marbling phenotypes at late stages of cattle growth.

so far, a well-known biochemical finding in relation to marbling expression in muscle was presented by jurie et al.  <cit> , who repored that fatty acid binding protein  <dig> activity was strongly correlated with intramuscular fat content. in their study they compared the different genetic performance of intramuscular fat deposition between two muscle types across three breeds. in this study however, fat metabolism related genes such as fabp <dig>  scd and lpl in muscle with divergent marbling phenotypes in late stage cattle were not detected. a similar study done by liu et al. <cit>  in pigs indicated that fabp <dig> was differentially expressed among muscle samples with a divergent intramuscular fat content at  <dig> kg but wasn't different at a later stage . these findings suggest that many lipogenic related genes, including fabp <dig>  will be more active during early growth during which imf deposition is more intense, rather than at later growth stages. alternatively, fabp <dig> is not detected as differentially expressed because all intramuscular fat was removed from the muscle samples used in this study .

in our study, all  <dig> differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  both methods showed consistent gene expression fold changes between the high and low marbled groups.

functional annotation of degs
gene ontology analysis and biological pathway searches were used to explore the functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes. one of the degs, cdc like kinase  <dig> showed a negative correlation with increase in imf content. this gene is part of the cell cycle signaling pathway. using a rat model, xiao et al.  <dig> found that the clk gene was also down-regulated with muscle fat during lactation. this might be due to decreasing expression of genes involved in protein synthesis through the cell cycle signaling pathway during lactation. another gene encoding a sh <dig> domainysc-like  <dig> was also up-regulated in animals with high imf content. the src homology  <dig>  domain is a small protein domain of about  <dig> amino-acid residues which was first identified as a conserved sequence in the non-catalytic part of several cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases. the function of the sh <dig> domain is not well understood. it seems to mediate the assembly of specific protein complexes via binding to proline-rich peptides. sh <dig> domain containing genes, sorbin and sh <dig> domain containing  <dig> , which are involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake  <cit>  have also been reported as up-regulated in muscle of highly marbled japanese black cattle   <cit> .

gene ontology analysis demonstrated that several genes that were more highly expressed in high marbled muscle are involved in protein catabolic and cholesterol biosynthesis processes. this was also reflected in the pathway analysis, which generated five major pathway "hubs"  for the genes more highly expressed in high marbled muscle. cyp51a and sqle protein appear to be involved in steroid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism. in particular, cyp51a is activated by two transcriptional factors, sp <dig> and srebp <dig> in lipid metabolism. more recently, chen et al.  <cit>  investigated gene expression of the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig>  in muscle from differing sexes  and differing genotype within srebp <dig> gene in pig. this study showed that the srebp <dig> gene was highly expressed in muscle from female compared with males. in addition there were differences in expression within the genotypes showing a strong positive correlation with intramuscular fat content. the cyp51a pathway which is driven by the srebp <dig> transcription factor might be one of the biological pathways associated to intramuscular fat in cattle. in this study srebp <dig> was not differentially expressed in the arrays.

pathway for the adamts <dig> gene
marbling fat accumulates in a connective tissue matrix in close proximity to a blood capillary network between the bundle of muscle fibres in bovine skeletal muscle  <cit> . under electron microscopy, reorganization and degradation of intramuscular connective tissue is observed in highly marbled muscle  <cit> . the relationship between marbling fat and protein content showed a negative correlation in longissimus of cattle; for example, longissimus with high level of fat decreased composition of moisture and protein in the carcasses  <cit> . microarray analysis identified that adamts <dig> is highly expressed in highly marbling muscle. adamts <dig> has a function of metalopetidase that degrades the extracellular matrix of connective tissue  <cit> . recently, one gene of the adam gene family, adam <dig> was reported as overexpressed in transgenic mice exhibiting increased intramuscular adipogenesis  <cit> . these findings suggest that adamts <dig> might be one of the key genes controlling the relationship between marbling fat deposition and connective tissue degradation through a complex biological pathway in skeletal muscle.

pathway analysis  suggested that adamts <dig> is activated by three regulators; il-17a, tnfα and transforming growth factor β  <dig>  that have not been previously considered to be associated with marbling fat. while only adamts <dig> was detected as differentially expressed in the arrays , the rt-pcr gene expression analysis found that adamts <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are highly co-expressed in highly marbled muscle while these two genes have a lower expression with higher protein content . the tgfβ <dig> is known to be a member of the gdf <dig> family that is a major gene known to affect carcass fatness and double muscling in cattle  <cit> . the gdf <dig> gene not only affects the size of muscle but also the proportion of connective tissue within the muscle and intramuscular fat %  <cit> . also, the gdf <dig> gene product is a growth regulator for muscle development. in cattle the mutation of this gene product causes a decrease in fat deposition and an increase in muscle mass of carcasses  <cit> . however, this study only shows that the adamts4/tgfβ <dig> pathway might be involved in phenotypic differences between high and low marbled cattle. therefore, an adamts4/tgfβ <dig> pathway could be an important biological pathway related to increase of marbling fat in bovine skeletal muscle.

CONCLUSIONS
genome wide microarray analysis was undertaken to explore novel biological pathways associated with marbling in hanwoo . in this study, microarray analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in muscle with divergent marbling phenotypes. pathway analysis for the  <dig> degs showed  <dig> unique pathway hubs associated with steroid biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism and common transcription factors in lipid metabolism. these biological pathways might represent a phenomenon occurring in muscle with highly divergent marbling phenotypes. out of these  <dig> main pathways, adamts <dig> is involved in protein catabolic process , which is biologically related to the connective tissue degradation that is observed in highly marbled muscle. pathway analysis revealed that adamts <dig> gene is activated by three regulators; il-17a, tnfα, and transforming growth factor β  <dig>  that have not previously been considered to be associated with marbling fat. gene expression analysis found that adamts <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are co-expressed in highly marbled muscle while these two genes have a lower expression with higher protein content. we conclude adamts <dig> might be one of the key genes controlling the relationship between marbling fat deposition and connective tissue degradation through a complex biological pathway in skeletal muscle. further studies will be necessary to unveil the biological function of this pathway .
