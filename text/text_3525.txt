BACKGROUND
the zinc-finger transcription factor gli <dig> is required for normal limb, brain and eye development. in humans, a number of different mutations to the gli <dig> allele can cause greig cephalopolysyndactyly  or pallister-hall syndrome   <cit> . clinical features of gcps include polydactyly, syndactyly, ocular hypertelorism and macrocephaly; those of phs include polydactyly, imperforate anus, renal abnormalities, hypothalamic hamartoma and pituitary dysplasia. mutations of the gli <dig> gene in mice cause the extra-toes  phenotype  <cit> . johnson  <cit>  first reported a comprehensive analysis of the developmental anatomy of xt mice. homozygotes die by birth and the most prominent defects are found in the distal limbs, in rostral portions of the head including the forebrain and eyes , along the ventral midline of the thorax and along the midline of the visceral ectoderm. heterozygotes are described as developing relatively normally in all respects bar the formation of an extra digit, or digit-like appendage, on either the fore- or hindlimbs.

the vertebrate transcription factors gli <dig>  gl <dig> and gli <dig> are homologues of the drosophila transcription factor cubitus interruptus  <cit> . these transcription factors transduce the responses of cells to diffusible morphogens of the hedgehog family in both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . although gli <dig> may have an early activator function in vertebrates  <cit> , it is thought that its main actions are to repress the expression of sonic hedgehog  target genes. thus, loss of gli <dig> in mice that also lack shh can reverse many of the defects associated with reduced hedgehog signalling  <cit> , presumably because loss of gli <dig> allows the reactivation of shh target genes.

with regards the requirement for gli <dig> in eye development,gli3-/- embryos exhibit a variety of eye abnormalities ranging from microphthalmia to the absence of any remnant of eye tissue  <cit> . most likely these defects stem from interference with normal shh signalling, which is essential for normal initiation of eye development  <cit>  and later neural retinal development  <cit> . the extent to which a normal gene dosage of gli <dig> is needed for eye development is not clear. the only eye defect described in mice heterozygous for mutations in gli <dig> is the presence of folded retinae in a proportion of neonatal animals  <cit> . in the present study, we characterized the eye phenotype of gli3+/- mice and identified previously undescribed defects that were subtle. we then considered whether the requirement for a normal dosage of gli <dig> might be greater if the gene dosage for another transcription factor known to be critical for eye development was to be reduced.

extensive work on pax <dig> has highlighted the important role that this molecule plays in both invertebrate and vertebrate eye development . mutations within the pax <dig> gene cause eye abnormalities in both mouse and man  <cit> . mice homozygous for null mutations in the pax <dig> gene fail to form eyes  <cit>  whereas mice heterozygous for pax <dig> mutations exhibit microphthalmia and have hypoplastic irises and multiple anterior segment defects  <cit> . there is evidence that pax <dig> is both regulated by and regulates expression of shh in brain tissue: shh has been shown to repress pax <dig> expression  <cit>  and loss of pax <dig> in mutant mice causes an upregulation of shh expression  <cit> . thus, reduction of either pax <dig> or gli <dig> levels might be predicted to affect eye development by activation, through different mechanisms, of shh signalling. when we compared pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes to the eyes of wild-type, pax6+/- or gli3+/- siblings we observed a range of abnormalities more extensive than in gli3+/- or pax6+/- mutants or than would be predicted by addition of their phenotypes.

RESULTS
overlapping expression of pax <dig> and gli <dig> in the developing eye
as shown in fig. 1a,b, pax <dig> and gli <dig> are expressed in the prenatal mouse eye . both genes are expressed in the neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium, lens and surface ectoderm.

general development of the eye in gli3+/-, pax6+/- and gli3+/-; pax6+/- mutants
the appearances of e <dig>  gli3+/-, pax6+/- and gli3+/-;pax6+/- eyes, immunostained for pax <dig> expression, are shown in fig. 1câ€“e. pax <dig> immunoreactivity was seen in the developing neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium, lens and surface ectoderm in all geneotypes, as in wild-types. there were, however, differences in morphology.

the e <dig>  gli3+/- eyes appeared slightly larger than those of wild-type siblings, although their appearances were otherwise normal . the e <dig>  pax6+/- eyes appeared smaller than those of wild-type siblings  and pax <dig> protein was seen in cells forming a lens-corneal bridge , as described previously  <cit> . the sizes of e <dig>  pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes were more variable than those of siblings of the other three genotypes; many were similar to those of pax6+/- eyes . pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes showed more obvious abnormalities than eyes of the other genotypes, including dysplasia at the most distal tips of the retina causing ectopic retinal tissue within the presumptive anterior chamber .

we then examined the overall mass of eyes of the different genotypes in adults . similar to previous studies  <cit> , we found that the average mass of pax6+/- eyes  was significantly less than that of wild-type eyes   . the average mass of gli3+/- eyes was slightly, but significantly, larger than that of wild-type eyes  . the average mass of pax6+/-; gli3+/-eyes  was significantly less than that of wild-type eyes , but not significantly different to that of pax6+/- eyes. there was much greater variation than among eyes of the other genotypes . whereas only 1/ <dig> pax6+/- eyes fell within the range for wild-type eyes, 12/ <dig> of pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes fell within the wild-type range and 4/ <dig> eyes weighed less than the smallest mass observed in the pax6+/- group .

pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals exhibit severe retinal abnormalities
no retinae from wild-type littermates of our mutant animals showed any overt abnormalities . the majority of gli3+/- animals  showed no retinal dysplasia ; a small proportion  did exhibit focal retinal hyperplasia . no retinal dysplasia was observed in any of the pax6+/- eyes studied  . pax6+/-; gli3+/- retinae fell into  <dig> categories. 1) some retinae exhibited no dysplasia but were thinner than those of other genotypes  . 2) some retinae were dysplastic   with areas where lamination was completely disrupted with loss of any defined retinal organisation and mixing of the nuclear layers.

we compared retinal thicknesses in the positions shown in fig. 4a in wild-type, pax6+/-, gli3+/- and pax6+/-;gli3+/- animals. compound heterozygotes that had retinal dysplasia in the regions measured were excluded. whole retinal thickness was significantly reduced in pax6+/-;gli3+/- animals compared to their wild-type, pax6+/- and gli3+/- siblings, all of which had similar thicknesses .

we then examined which retinal layers were most affected in pax6+/-; gli3+/- retinae. the adult neural retina is divided into  <dig> layers: the outer nuclear layer , the outer plexiform layer , the inner nuclear layer , the inner plexiform layer  and the ganglion cell layer . we found that the thicknesses of both the onl and inl of pax6+/-; gli3+/- retinae were significantly reduced compared to those of the other genotypes . in some pax6+/-; gli3+/- retinae , the opl was not discernible; where this layer was present, its average thickness was not significantly different to that of wild-type animals . interestingly, the opls of both pax6+/- and gli3+/- retinae were thicker than those of wild-type and pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals . the ipl of the pax6+/-; gli3+/- retina was significantly thinner than that of wild-type and gli3+/- retinae, but was not significantly different to that of pax6+/- animals , which was itself significantly thinner than that of wild-types . as the gcl is only one cell thick, measurement was not done on this layer. we did not, however, observe any obvious defects in the gcl in any of the genotype groups. overall, we concluded that the thicknesses of the retina and most of its layers are severely compromised in pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals but not in pax6+/- or gli3+/- siblings.

anterior segment and lens defects in pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals
consistent with previous studies  <cit> , we observed lens-corneal adhesions with cellular bridges in pax6+/- embryonic  and adult eyes . lens-corneal adhesions were found with a similar incidence in pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes . we observed several other types of abnormal contact in pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes, which were not found in wild-type, pax6+/- or gli3+/- eyes in our sample. these were common between the cornea and iris  but were also seen between retina and lens and iris and retina . some gli3+/- eyes showed small points of contact between the iris and lens ; these were not seen in pax6+/-eyes and were more frequent and extensive in pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes . we can not be sure of the exact nature of these contacts, but the fact that we did not observe them in wild-type eyes suggests that they reflect real defects in the interactions between different parts of the eye.

many pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes exhibited highly dysgenic hyperplastic irises  , which were not observed in any of the other genotype groups. large cyst-like structures were observed between the iris, retina and overlying cornea  in one pax6+/-; gli3+/- eye. some pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals  showed highly dysmorphic and dysgenic lenses, which were not observed in any of the other genotype groups .

corneal defects in pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals
the corneal epithelium of the pax6+/- eye has been reported to be thinner than normal and the corneal stroma is hypercellular  <cit> . we confirmed these findings in our samples . at the gross level, no differences were observed in the cornea between wild-type and gli3+/- animals . pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals exhibited similar corneal abnormalities to those observed in pax6+/- animals .

thicknesses of the corneal epithelium and corneal stroma, centrally and peripherally, were measured for the four genotype groups. there was no difference in both central or peripheral corneal epithelium thickness between wild-type and gli3+/- eyes . as previously described  <cit> , the corneal epithelium of pax6+/- eyes  was significantly thinner than that of wild-type  and gli3+/-  eyes, both centrally and peripherally . a similar result was observed in pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes  . overall, these data suggest that loss of one copy of both pax <dig> and gli <dig> together does not create a corneal epithelium thinner than that resulting from loss of pax <dig> alone.

there was no difference in either central or peripheral corneal stromal thickness in pax6+/- or gli3+/- eyes compared to wild-type eyes . the peripheral stroma of pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes was, however, slightly thinner than that of wild-type and gli3+/- eyes, while the central stroma was not different to that of wild-type eyes . thus, the mean stromal thickness  of pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes was significantly less than that of wild-type , pax6+/-  and gli3+/-  eyes.

discussion
the importance of the transcription factors pax <dig>  <cit>  and gli <dig> <cit>  in eye development is reflected in the severe eye phenotypes of homozygous mutants, which die around the time of birth. while it is well documented that loss of one copy of pax <dig> results in various eye defects  <cit> , little is known about whether loss of one copy of gli <dig> results in eye defects. thus, in this study, we set out to characterise the morphology of the gli3+/- eye. furthermore, because both pax <dig> and gli <dig> are expressed in the optic cup/retina, lens and iris during development  <cit> , we were also interested in whether pax <dig> and gli <dig> play mutually co-operative roles in eye formation by studying animals compound heterozygous for mutations in both pax <dig> and gli <dig> 

no abnormality was observed in the majority of the gli3+/- eyes that we examined. where abnormalities were seen, they were very mild. gli3+/- eyes had a slightly higher mass than wild-type eyes as well as a thicker opl compared to wild-type retinae. retinal folding has been described previously in some neonatal gli3+/- animals  <cit> . overall, defects in gli3+/- eyes are either not detectable or minor.

animals compound heterozygous for mutations in both pax <dig> and gli <dig> exhibited unique and more severe eye defects than either pax6+/- or gli3+/- animals or than would be predicted by addition of their phenotypes. as previously described  <cit> , the mass of pax6+/- adult eyes was significantly smaller than that of wild-type eyes. the additional loss of one copy of gli <dig> resulted in eyes with a wide range of eye mass, from some eyes with smaller mass than pax6+/- eyes to some eyes which fell within the wild-type range of eye mass.

a range of retinal phenotypes was observed in pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes. some pax6+/-; gli3+/- retinae were thinner than normal but exhibited normal lamination while others were severely dysgenic with considerable laminar dysmorphology. the severe retinal defects found in pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals were never seen in either pax6+/- or gli3+/- animals. one mechanism by which pax <dig> and gli <dig> might cooperate during retinal development is through their actions in the shh signalling pathway. this pathway is critical for normal eye development. shh from the ventral midline of the early neural plate stage embryo is required for early patterning of the visual system  <cit> . later, shh is expressed in the developing retina  <cit>  and has been shown to be important in photoreceptor development and retinal lamination  <cit> . gli <dig> is essential for the transduction of shh signalling: in the absence of shh, the gli <dig> protein is cleaved proteolytically to produce a form that is thought to function mainly as a repressor  <cit> . lowering the gene dosage of gli <dig> can partially rescue the shh-null phenotype  <cit> , suggesting that reducing gli <dig> levels allows the partial reactivation of shh signalling pathways. it is possible, therefore, that a reduced level of gli <dig> in otherwise wild-type cells  mimics the effects of raising shh levels. there is evidence that shh suppresses pax <dig> expression  <cit> , and lowered pax <dig> expression is known to affect eye development. while the loss of one copy of gli <dig>  might not lower pax <dig> levels enough to create morphologically detectable defects if both alleles of pax <dig> are functional, levels might fall below a critical threshold in pax6+/-;gli3+/- heterozygotes. furthermore, there is evidence that pax <dig> suppresses shh expression  <cit>  and so the decreased levels of pax <dig> in the pax6+/-;gli3+/- heterozygotes might allow increased production of shh, thereby further exacerbating the overstimulation of the shh pathway. the mechanism by which reduced levels of the repressor form of gli <dig> result in reduced pax <dig> levels might involve loss of repression of intermediate transcription factors such as pax <dig> and vax <dig>  that themselves repress pax <dig>  <cit> . these possibilities are summarized in fig.  <dig>  while an interaction in shh signalling seems likely, there are numerous other signalling pathways in which gli <dig> and pax <dig> might cooperate. a strong possibility is in fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  signalling, since both gli <dig> and pax <dig> are known to regulate fgf <dig> expression  <cit> 

like the defects in the retina, abnormalities in the anterior segment of the pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals were more severe than those of either pax6+/- or gli3+/- animals. pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals had highly dysgenic lenses which were never seen in pax6+/- or gli3+/- animals. there were particularly high incidences of abnormal contacts involving the iris in pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals and, in contrast to the iris hypoplasia observed in pax6+/- animals, many pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals exhibited hyperplastic irises. together these data suggest not only that the iris is sensitive to levels of pax <dig> expression but that normal gli <dig> expression may also be required, in conjunction with pax <dig>  for normal iris development to occur. pax6+/-; gli3+/- animals also showed thinning of the corneal epithelium and disorganisation of the corneal stroma, similar to that observed in pax6+/- animals. unlike pax6+/- and gli3+/- animals, however, the peripheral corneal stroma was significantly thinner than in wild-types. as gli3+/- animals showed no difference in the thickness of the corneal stroma, the reduction of gli <dig> dosage alone does not affect stromal thickness but does so only in combination with reduced pax <dig> dosage.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that animals compound heterozygous for mutations in both pax <dig> and gli <dig> have eye abnormalities that are either not present in, or are more severe than, those present in animals heterozygous for mutations in either gene. addition of the phenotypes of pax6+/- and gli3+/- animals is insufficient to explain the severe phenotypes of the compound mutants. our findings suggest that gli <dig> and pax <dig> cooperate during eye morphogenesis.
