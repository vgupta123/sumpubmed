BACKGROUND
in the last decade two enzymes belonging to the poly-ribose polymerase  superfamily, tankyrase  <dig>  and  <dig> , were identified as key regulators of spindle pole assembly through poly-ribosylation  of several microtubule-related proteins within the spindle apparatus  <cit> . poly -ribose  units have also been accredited as integral spindle constituents, with tnks and tnks <dig>  being the prime regulators of spindle-associated par synthesis  <cit> . tnks/ <dig> downregulation is consistently reported to yield aberrant mitotic phenotypes, including microtubule defects and supernumerary spindles  <cit> . tnks/ <dig> are also required for proper sister telomere resolution  <cit>  and centrosome function  <cit> . altogether, these observations added to the archetypal function of these enzymes as positive regulators of telomere homeostasis  <cit>  and spurred a growing interest in neutralizing their activity to induce spindle dysfunction and disable the mitotic engine in cancer cells  <cit> . independent studies have also shown that tnks/ <dig> positively regulate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. in particular, tnks/ <dig> have been reported to inhibit the β-catenin destruction complex by promoting the degradation of its rate-limiting component, axin <dig>  <cit> . consequently, β-catenin remains unbridled and is allowed to enter the nucleus, where its gene program is released  <cit> .

the multifaceted activities exerted by tankyrases can be explained by the vast number and heterogeneity of putative tnks/ <dig> substrates: in silico analyses have put forward hundreds of candidates  <cit> , some of which—including mitotic regulators, transcription factors, and signaling adaptors—have been validated as true tnks/ <dig> binders by classic protein–protein interaction assays . however, the biological relevance of most such interactions still require experimental scrutiny, suggesting that other, as yet unappreciated, functions of tnks/ <dig> will emerge soon.

in this work, we provide evidence of a novel role for tnks/ <dig> in regulating directional migration. by using two distinct and structurally unrelated inhibitors, including a new investigational compound for which we provide original structural, pharmacological, and biochemical characterization, we found that abrogation of tnks/ <dig> activity markedly weakened cancer cell motility owing to perturbation of recognized microtubule-dependent routes that govern cell-oriented locomotion. the finding that tnks/ <dig> blockade impacts microtubule-based cellular processes not only at mitosis but also in interphase cells expands our knowledge about tnks/ <dig> functions at the cellular level and should hasten the preclinical development of tnks/ <dig> inhibitors for applicative purposes.

tnks/ <dig> inhibition hampers lung cancer cell invasion and migration in response to hepatocyte growth factor
although mutations of apc or β-catenin are infrequent in lung cancer, hyperactivation of the wnt pathway, as evidenced by transcriptional overexpression of wnt-responsive genes, has been documented in samples from aggressive lung adenocarcinomas  <cit> . because tnks/ <dig> are accredited upstream regulators of the wnt pathway  <cit> , we initially pursued the idea that interception of tnks/ <dig> activity might prevent wnt-induced lung cancer cell dissemination. as a first step, we explored the consequences of tnks/ <dig> blockade on cell motility in four lung adenocarcinoma cell lines—h <dig>  hcc <dig>  h <dig>  and a549—using xav <dig> and jnj-bj as tool compounds.

to provide proof of concept that tnks/ <dig> blockade was proficient in lung cancer, a <dig> cells were treated with increasing concentrations of xav <dig> or jnj-bj for 24 h and assessed for expression of axin <dig>  which is typically stabilized by tnks/ <dig> inhibition owing to impaired tnks/2-mediated parsylation and consequent protein degradation  <cit> . western blot analysis of total cell extracts revealed that both compounds were able to induce a dose-dependent increase of axin <dig> protein content , indicating successful tnks/ <dig> inactivation. remarkably, when challenged in matrigel-coated transwell systems using hepatocyte growth factor  as a chemoattractant  <cit> , a <dig> cells exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in invasive ability following tnks/ <dig> inactivation by xav <dig> or jnj-bj .fig.  <dig> tankyrase  <dig> and  <dig>  inhibition by xav <dig> or jnj-bj impairs hepatocyte growth factor -dependent cell migration and invasion in non-small cell lug cancer  cells. a western blot showing the amount of axin <dig> in total protein extracts from a <dig> cells treated with a range of concentrations of xav <dig> or jnj-bj for 24 h. actin was used as a loading control. molecular weights are indicated. b dose-dependent inhibition of hgf-induced invasion in a <dig> cells by treatment with increasing concentrations of xav <dig> or jnj-bj . quantification was carried out by imagej software. tnksi tnks/ <dig> inhibitor. data are the means  ± standard error of the mean  of three independent experiments , each performed in technical duplicate. c western blot analysis showing the levels of axin <dig> in whole-cell extracts from the indicated nsclc cell lines. before protein extraction, cells were incubated with 10 μm xav <dig> or jnj-bj for 24 h. actin was used as a loading control. molecular weights are indicated. d imagej quantification of hgf-induced invasion in the indicated cell lines upon tnks/ <dig> blockade . data are the means  ± sem of three or four independent experiments , each performed in technical duplicate. e representative images of a scratch assay performed with the indicated cell lines in the following experimental conditions : non-stimulated control wound ; hgf-treated cells 24 h after wounding ; hgf-treated and xav939/jnj-bj-treated cells 24 h after wounding . plots on the right depict imagej quantification of wound repair inhibition 24 h after scratch. data are the means  ± sem of three independent experiments , each performed in technical duplicate or triplicate. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig>  by two-tailed student’s t-test . raw data for panels b, d, and e are shown in additional file 3




analyses were subsequently extended to the remaining lung cancer cell lines by applying the dose that yielded maximal invasion impairment in the setup experiments . in the case of xav <dig>  5–10 μm is the standard inhibitor concentration commonly used in biological studies  <cit> . consistent with that observed in a <dig>  axin <dig> was invariably stabilized upon treatment with either compound . similarly, tnks/ <dig> inactivation compromised hgf-induced chemotactic response to a comparable extent in all the cell lines tested, apart from a weaker activity of xav <dig> in h <dig> . a decrease in cell invasion was paralleled by reduced migration in wound healing  assays. with the exception of h <dig> cells , abrogation of tnks/ <dig> activity markedly dampened hgf-induced wound closure competence .

it is worth noting that in these cells we did not observe noticeable anti-proliferative effects following tnks/ <dig> inhibition, even after a 72 h exposure to drugs . this result is at odds with the established mitotic function of tnks/ <dig>  but is congruent with previous observations showing that tnks/ <dig> pharmacological inhibition is much less detrimental to cell proliferation than rna interference -based silencing  <cit> . whatever the explanation for this discrepancy, which remains a matter of debate  <cit> , these findings suggest that mechanisms other than a mere growth disadvantage are implicated in the reduced cell motility observed in response to tnks/ <dig> blockade.

we also employed rnai as an alternative means of inactivating tnks/ <dig>  in agreement with pharmacologic experiments, productive co-depletion of tnks and tnks <dig> in a <dig> cells  resulted in axin <dig> stabilization  and reduced cell invasion . likewise, wound closure ability was lessened by rnai-mediated tnks/ <dig> silencing in a <dig> cells . although genetic knockdown of tnks/ <dig> has been shown to affect cell proliferation, the time frame of transwell and scratch assays  was likely sufficiently short not to bias the anti-invasive outcome of tnks/ <dig> abrogation. in summary, impaired cell invasion proved to be a direct function of increasing compound concentrations and was achieved by two structurally different inhibitors; moreover, tnks/ <dig> genetic silencing recapitulated the biochemical and biological effects of pharmacologic inhibition. these findings indicate that the impaired chemotactic response is a specific consequence of tnks/ <dig> disruption.

the anti-invasive outcome of tnks/ <dig> inhibition is independent of the wnt pathway
the anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects produced by tnks/ <dig> neutralization were consistent with the working hypothesis that blockade of tnks/ <dig> activity would blunt wnt-mediated pro-invasive cues. we therefore analyzed whether this weakened chemotactic response was in fact ascribable to interception of wnt signaling.

first, the topflash reporter system was employed to gauge wnt-dependent transcriptional responses after cell exposure to tnks/ <dig> inhibitors . we found that tnks/ <dig> inhibition did not affect wnt transcriptional activity, either basally or upon addition of the canonical wnt ligand wnt3a . as a complementary approach, expression of established wnt target genes was assessed by rt-qpcr in the whole panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines tested in the cell invasion experiments. as shown in additional file 8: figure s3b , stimulation with wnt3a led to increased expression of at least some of the target genes, with variable levels of induction in the various cell lines . also in this experimental setting, and consistent with the topflash assay, cell line-dependent transcription of wnt3a target genes was not detectably influenced by treatment with tnks/ <dig> inhibitors . finally, transwell assays demonstrated that cell invasion was not evidently fostered by wnt3a , further supporting the irrelevance of wnt signaling to tnks/2-related migratory phenotypes in our cellular models.

all in all, wnt-dependent activities did not substantially enhance cell motility in lung cancer cell lines, nor were they clearly impacted by tnks/ <dig> inactivation. this implies that the observed effects on migration and invasion likely rely on alternative mechanisms.

tnks/ <dig> inhibition impacts the dynamics of formation of cell membrane protrusions
to get better insight into how cell motogenic responses were impacted by tnks/ <dig> abrogation, wounded a <dig> monolayers were treated with hgf and monitored for 1 h using time-lapse videomicroscopy in the presence or absence of jnj-bj, which was selected as the best performing compound in preliminary experiments . single images were captured every 12 s to allow for distinct visualization of the migration process . figure 3a shows representative time-lapse snapshots, captured  <dig>   <dig>  and 60 min after hgf stimulation. we noticed that the dynamics of protrusion formation at the wound edge were discernibly slowed by jnj-bj. in particular, control cells displayed pronounced membrane ruffling, characterized by repetitive and vigorous bursts of incipient projections at the leading edge ; by contrast, protrusive activity appeared flimsier and membrane extensions subsided quickly in cells treated with jnj-bj. besides the stronger propulsive flows, control cells also developed numerous circular dorsal ruffles , whose function generally implies transition from a static to a motile phenotype  <cit> ; conversely, the formation of such structures was almost completely prevented by jnj-bj .fig.  <dig> inactivation of tankyrase  <dig> and  <dig>  weakens protrusive activity and lamellipodia formation. a phase-contrast snapshots extracted from a 1 h time-lapse movie of wounded a <dig> monolayers treated with hepatocyte growth factor  in the presence or absence of jnj-bj . white arrows indicate membrane projections; yellow arrows label circular dorsal ruffles. see additional file 10: movie m <dig> for complete visualization. scale bar, 7 μm. b quantitation of membrane protrusions in hgf-stimulated wound-edge a <dig> cells with or without tnks/ <dig> inhibitors . results are expressed as the percentage of protrusion-positive cells ± standard error of the mean. a minimum of  <dig> cells was counted for each experimental point in three independent experiments . raw data for panel b are shown in additional file  <dig>  dmso dimethyl sulfoxide



on the basis of such observations, we assumed that tnks/ <dig> inhibition impaired cell movement by negatively impacting migration dynamics at the leading edge. to complement the time-lapse qualitative information, we quantified membrane extensions in hgf-stimulated a <dig> cells with or without tnks/ <dig> inhibitors. as shown in fig. 3b , the proportion of protruding cells was significantly decreased by either compound after  <dig> and 30 min of hgf exposure. remarkably, the curves related to tnks/2-inhibited cells tended to re-align with the curve of control cells after 1 h, suggesting that tnks/ <dig> blockade hindered early rather than late events of cell migration.

tnks/ <dig> inhibition enhances microtubule stability in interphase cells
tnks/ <dig> couple with the mitotic microtubule circuitry to affect spindle structure and function  <cit> . as specified earlier, this is accomplished through interaction with various microtubule-related proteins as well as with other spindle-associated targets  <cit> . we reasoned that analogous functional connections might be extended to interphase microtubule-dependent activities, whose dynamics are intimately related to polarized cell migration  <cit> .

inception of oriented cell movement entails microtubule-dependent reorganization of the cellular architecture to establish a rear–front axis. this asymmetric pattern is supported by the inherent instability of microtubules, which constantly undergo rounds of shrinkage and regrowth  <cit> . to investigate whether tnks/ <dig> neutralization interfered with microtubule dynamic instability, we deconstructed the microtubule network in a <dig> cells by cold treatment  or nocodazole . under basal conditions, microtubules were intact and their organization was similar in both untreated and tnks/2-inhibited cells . notably, cold-induced or nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly was widespread in control cells whereas it was markedly prevented in cells treated with xav <dig> or jnj-bj . this indicates that microtubules were rendered more stable by tnks/ <dig> inactivation. rnai-mediated tnks/ <dig> depletion recapitulated the phenotype produced by tnks/ <dig> pharmacologic inactivation .fig.  <dig> the microtubule network is stabilized by tankyrase  <dig> and  <dig>  pharmacological neutralization. a confocal images and b morphometric quantitation of the microtubule network at standard temperature  or after cold  exposure. starved a <dig> cells were pre-incubated for 24 h with or without tnks/ <dig> inhibitors  and then placed on ice for 6 min  before immediate fixation and staining with anti-α-tubulin antibody. scale bar, 7 μm. images are representative of one experiment out of two performed. a minimum of  <dig> cells from at least two different fields were analyzed for content of polymerized tubulin. ***p <  <dig>  by two-tailed student’s t-test. ns not significant. raw data for panel b are shown in additional file  <dig>  dmso dimethyl sulfoxide



the finding that tnks/ <dig> blockade increased the proportion of stable microtubules suggests that tnks/ <dig> inhibition might obstruct microtubule-dependent activities implicated in cell polarity and directional migration.

tnks/ <dig> inhibition affects centrosome reorientation in migrating cells
microtubule-related activities are central to polarized cell migration through mechanisms that involve protein targeting to cortical sites and the generation of pulling forces that help reorganize cell architecture in response to chemotactic cues  <cit> . one hallmark of cell polarization is the relative orientation of the nuclear-centrosome axis with respect to the rear–front axis ; in general, this alignment is thought to correlate with the onset of cell migration and to contribute to the establishment of cell polarity by facilitating membrane trafficking from both the golgi and the endocytic recycling compartments towards the leading edge  <cit> . centrosome positioning is largely influenced by microtubule dynamics; regardless of context-dependent idiosyncratic differences, it is apparent that during productive cell locomotion the centrosome relocates in front of the nucleus facing the direction of cell migration  <cit> .

on such premises, we explored whether tnks/ <dig> inhibition could perturb microtubule-dependent establishment of cell asymmetry by measuring the amount of reoriented centrosomes in wound-edge a <dig> cells following induction of migration by hgf. based on previously published studies  <cit> , centrosomes were scored as “fully polarized” if the angle between the nuclear-centrosome axis  and the front-back axis  was less than 30°, which vouches for centrosome dwelling within the forward-facing quadrant . in hgf-treated cells without tnks/ <dig> inhibitors, centrosome location shifted from an essentially random distribution around the nucleus to a biased rearrangement along the migration axis, with polarization angles reflecting a progressive degree of cell orientation over time . the increase of fully polarized centrosomes was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the number of untailored centrosomes displaying angles greater than 60° . remarkably, hgf-induced acquisition of the polarized phenotype was antagonized by treatment with either tnks/ <dig> inhibitor. at 1 h after cell wounding, almost 50 % of control cells were fully polarized, compared to only 34 % and 29 % of xav939-treated and jnj-bj-treated cells, respectively; also the decline of non-polarized centrosomes was not as manifest as that observed in control cells . after 4 h, 60 % of control cells showed fully oriented centrosomes, as opposed to nearly 40 % of tnks/2-inhibited cells . akin to tnks/ <dig> pharmacologic blockade, genetic knockdown of both tnks and tnks <dig> in a <dig> cells disturbed centrosome repositioning upon hgf stimulus . collectively, these results indicate that tnks/ <dig> inactivation results in perturbed centrosome reorientation in migrating cells, with delayed alignment along the rear–front axis.fig.  <dig> centrosome reorientation is retarded by tankyrase i and  <dig>  inhibitors in migrating cells. representative confocal images of centrosome localization in migrating a <dig> cells. wound-edge a <dig> cells, with or without tnks/ <dig> inhibitors , were stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor   for 4 h. immunofluorescence staining of centrosomes was carried out using anti-γ-tubulin antibody. centrosome polarization was assessed at the indicated time points. pie charts display the percentage distribution of distinct angles  formed by the nuclear-centrosome axis  and a line perpendicular to the wound . centrosomes were considered oriented when α < 30°. a minimum of  <dig> cells was analyzed for centrosome polarization in three independent experiments. p-values were calculated by the chi-square test using graphpad quickcalcs software. scale bar, 7 μm. raw data are shown in additional file  <dig>  dmso dimethyl sulfoxide



tnks/ <dig> inhibition retards apc recruitment at the leading edge
adenomatous polyposis coli  is a strategic cytoskeletal coordinator of migration directionality owing to its recruitment to microtubule-dependent clusters at protrusive areas. this is thought to regulate microtubule anchoring at the cell cortex and consequent centrosome rearrangement  <cit> . with this in mind, we assessed hgf-induced redistribution of apc in wounded a <dig> cell monolayers, either left untreated or exposed to tnks/ <dig> inhibitors. immunofluorescence staining showed a diffuse apc cytoplasmic distribution along with an intense nuclear signal , consistent with the notion that apc shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to assist β-catenin nuclear export  <cit> . immediately after wounding, apc was evenly distributed throughout the cell monolayer and in cells closely adjacent to the wound area . apc redistribution in cortical clusters at the wound edge was evident in control cells as early as 15 min after hgf stimulation and persisted up to 1 h . by contrast, treatment with tnks/ <dig> inhibitors led to a marked attenuation of apc membrane targeting at the 15 min time point after hgf stimulation. morphometric quantitation revealed that the number of apc-positive protrusions was reduced by tnks/ <dig> inactivation also when normalized against the number of total protrusions . this indicates that the impairment of apc membrane relocalization was not a mere consequence of lessened membrane ruffling secondary to tnks/ <dig> blockade. of note, the representative curves of control and tnks/2-inhibited cells tended to readjust over time: in fact, apc-decorated lamellipodia were equally represented at 30 min and 1 h post-wounding in all the conditions tested . thus, tnks/ <dig> inhibition deferred apc membrane redistribution in response to hgf, which integrates with our previous data about retarded centrosome repositioning. the fact that apc localization in protrusions was only transiently retarded, whereas centrosome reorientation was impaired for longer times, is congruent with the notion that, once cell polarization is established, positive feedback loops initiate between the actin-rich cortex and the microtubule cytoskeleton to maintain and reinforce the existing polarity axis  <cit> . therefore, while apc relocation is required for centrosome rearrangement, the persistence of such a tailored phenotype is likely sustained by processes that engage proteins and network interactions other than apc, together with the microtubule cytoskeleton. remarkably, impaired accumulation of apc at the protrusive front was even exacerbated by rnai-mediated tnks/ <dig> knockdown; indeed, hgf-induced recruitment of apc at cortical areas was prevented at all the time points in a <dig> wound-edge cells transduced with tnks- and tnks2- short hairpin rnas .fig.  <dig> tankyrase  <dig> and  <dig>  inhibitors delay the formation of cortical adenomatous polyposis coli  clusters in migrating cells. a confocal images of serum-starved, wound-edge a <dig> cells, either untreated or treated with tnks/ <dig> inhibitors  and then subject to a time course of hepatocyte growth factor  stimulation . cells were fixed and stained with anti-apc antibody. b quantitation of apc-decorated protrusions. the curves represent apc enrichment in cortical areas over time. results are expressed as the percentage of apc-positive protrusion ± standard error of the mean. a minimum of  <dig> cells was counted for each experimental condition in three independent experiments . scale bar, 7 μm. raw data for panel b are shown in additional file  <dig>  dmso dimethyl sulfoxide



finally, to get further insight into how tnks/ <dig> may regulate apc-dependent microtubule dynamics, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of tnks and apc in migrating a <dig> cells. we found that both apc and tnks were recruited at the leading edge upon hgf stimulation . similar to apc, tnks enrichment at membrane protrusions was impaired in the presence of tnks/ <dig> inhibitors . tnks staining was specific, because tnks/ <dig> blockade also induced the formation of tnks-enriched puncta, a reported phenotype of tnks/2-inhibited cells  <cit>  .

the fact that tnks follows subcellular dynamics similar to those experienced by apc and the experimental observation that persistent obliteration of tnks/ <dig> by genetic silencing durably precludes apc relocation at the leading edge reinforce the hypothesis that tnks/ <dig> are implicated in the establishment of cell polarization during oriented locomotion. taken together, these observations allow us to draw a coherent scenario whereby tnks/ <dig> blockade appears to interfere sequentially with regulated events that, in space and time, orchestrate the establishment of cellular polarity. this perturbation of cell polarity is facilitated by the enhanced microtubule stability produced by tnks/ <dig> inactivation.

discussion
the parps tnks and tnks <dig> were initially identified as key players in telomere homeostasis through inhibition of trf <dig>  a negative regulator of telomere length  <cit> . independent lines of evidence also accredited tnks/ <dig> as positive regulators of microtubule-dependent mitotic events through their interaction with a number of spindle-associated proteins   <cit>  as well as through parsylation of key centrosomal targets   <cit> . finally, tnks/ <dig> have recently been identified as upstream components of the wnt/β-catenin pathway, which encourages cell proliferation by intensification of β-catenin transcriptional activities  <cit> . the notion that tankyrases have versatile activities in processes that, when gone awry, invariably lead to aberrant cell growth, has spurred the development of several tnks/ <dig> inhibitors  <cit> .

here we report a new function of tnks/ <dig> that does not involve regulation of cell cycle entry or cell division, but rather influences cell polarity and directional cell locomotion. indeed, we found that pharmacological inhibition of tnks/ <dig> dampens microtubule-dependent cell chemotactic responses. because recent data have linked wnt transcriptional signatures to the metastatic competence of lung adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> , our initial working hypothesis was that the anti-migratory outcome of tnks/ <dig> inhibition might be ascribed to impaired wnt signaling. however, in our experimental setup, tnks/ <dig> inhibition did not substantially affect wnt-associated responses and wnt stimulation did not detectably promote cell invasion, indicating that the decline of cell motility as a consequence of tnks/ <dig> inhibition occurred irrespective of wnt activity. this hints that tnks/2-directed drugs are likely to prove effective as inhibitors of wnt signals only in those tumors that display constitutive wnt activation on a genetic basis, such as colorectal cancer. indeed, there is cumulative evidence that pharmacologic neutralization of tnks/ <dig> activity proficiently  impairs the growth of apc-mutant colorectal cancer cells by attenuating wnt-mediated signals  <cit> .

none of the established functions of tnks/ <dig> can explain the less motile phenotype observed in tnks/2-inhibited cells. live imaging of migrating cells allowed us to detect less intense and less persistent protrusive activities upon tnks/ <dig> blockade, likely reflecting different cytoskeletal dynamics at the leading edge. on the one hand, tnks/ <dig> play a documented role in the regulation of microtubules during mitosis. on the other hand, many facets of cell protrusions—including orientation and persistence—are determined by microtubule-related activities, and disruption of the microtubule network impairs protruding activity in several cellular contexts . we therefore sought to extend the connection between tnks/ <dig> and the microtubule network from mitotic to interphase-related processes, with a specific focus on whether and how tnks/ <dig> may influence microtubule-dependent cell polarization as a prelude to directional movement.

the regulation of microtubule dynamics during cell polarization is complex. in general, it is believed that a wide range of polarity cues, including intracellular signals such as cdc <dig> and soluble morphogens such as motogenic growth factors, converge to activate transducers that phosphorylate and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta   <cit> . this leads to apc interaction with the microtubule plus ends at the leading edge, which stabilizes the microtubule network specifically at the protrusive areas and generates pulling forces that reorient the centrosome and align it along the rear–front axis  <cit> . successful implementation of all these events requires consecutive episodes of microtubule catastrophes  and rescues  in order to grant microtubules with local “search-and-capture” activity. accordingly, it has been demonstrated that several proteins that stall microtubule dynamics exert anti-invasive effects by preventing microtubules from probing outward, resulting in faulty capture to cortical sites and reduced receptiveness of chemotactic inputs  <cit> . we found that tnks/ <dig> blockade impacted some of these aspects of cell directional sensing. first, cells treated with tnks/ <dig> inhibitors retained a preserved microtubule cytoskeleton in the face of disruptive stimuli, indicative of enhanced microtubule stabilization. second, during hgf-induced migration, tnks/2-inhibited cells experienced delayed recruitment of apc at the leading edge. third, as a consequence of all these interferences, tnks/2-inhibited cells showed deteriorated orientation of the centrosome towards the leading edge. cell migration relies on sequential waves of protrusive activities at the leading edge. therefore, our observation that membrane projections and apc cortical targeting were deferred in treated cells can well explain the negative impact of tankyrase inhibition on cell motility as a whole.

the identification of tnks/ <dig> effectors responsible for the observed activities on cell polarity and directional migration will likely prove daunting. the manifold outcomes of tnks/ <dig> inhibition, which appear to vary in different cellular settings and at different moments of the cell life cycle, illustrate the versatile nature of such enzymes, which in turn is rooted in the plethora of potential substrates and interactors. it is therefore conceivable that tnks/ <dig> redundantly affect cell migration by influencing the fate and function of many substrates rather than by selective modulation of one partner. although a more precise elucidation of how such interconnections mechanistically contribute to the anti-migratory effects of tnks/ <dig> inhibition awaits further studies, our work illuminates new angles in the evolving landscape of tankyrase-related biology and sets the stage for widening the potential scope of tnks/2-tailored strategies beyond the currently prevailing paradigms.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results highlight a crucial role for tankyrases in maneuvering the interphase microtubule apparatus at various levels, from dynamic instability to localization of polarity signals. these findings add new layers of information to our current knowledge of tankyrase biology and may inform new approaches for the preclinical and clinical evaluation of anti-tnks/ <dig> drugs.
