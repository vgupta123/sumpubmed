BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation is a reversible mechanism used in all kingdoms of life to regulate protein activity, location and stability  <cit> . protein n-acetylation which is irreversible can regulate protein stability and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . many proteins  are n-acetylated, the enzymes responsible for n-acetylation have been identified, and their substrate specificities characterized  <cit> . the role of n-acetylation, however, remains unclear for the majority of substrates to date. strikingly, proteins bearing n-terminal signal sequences are usually not n-acetylated  <cit> . if the modification is introduced by mutation, n-acetylation leads to missorting of secretory proteins to the cytosol. these observations led to the conclusion that n-acetylation interferes with er targeting  <cit> .

although protein flux across the er membrane can be extremely variable, nothing is known about the regulation of the activity of the protein translocation channel in the er membrane. in yeast the channel is composed of  <dig> subunits, sec61p, sbh1p and sss1p, which form the sec <dig> complex responsible for cotranslational protein import into the er  <cit> . the channel subunits are highly conserved with mammalian proteins sec61α, sec61ß and sec61γ. in yeast, posttranslational import into the er of proteins with less hydrophobic signal sequences is mediated by a heptameric complex which in addition to the sec <dig> complex contains the sec <dig> complex   <cit> . yeast also express a homologue of sec61p, ssh1p, which together with sss1p and a homologue of sbh1p, sbh2p, forms the ssh <dig> complex responsible exclusively for co-translational import into the er  <cit> . protein translocation into the er and the sec <dig>  sss <dig>  sec <dig> and sec <dig> genes are essential. deletion of either sbh <dig> or sbh <dig> does not affect yeast viability, but deletion of both genes leads to temperature-sensitivity  <cit> .

sbh1p and sbh2p interact with multiple partners, and it is not known how these interactions are regulated. sbh1p and sbh2p are small tail-anchored proteins in the er membrane with largely unstructured cytosolic domains and single α-helical transmembrane domains which on their own can complement the temperature sensitivity of a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain  <cit> . the cytosolic domain of sbh2p, however, modulates interactions of its transmembrane domain  <cit> , and this is likely also the case for the sbh1p cytosolic domain. sbh2p is required for efficient transfer of the nascent polypeptide from signal recognition particle  into the ssh <dig> channel, and may signal to the srp receptor whether the ssh <dig> channel is already occupied by a ribosome  <cit> . in mammalian cells, sec61ß mediates association of signal peptidase with the sec <dig> channel  <cit> . the cytosolic domain of sec61ß can bind to the ribosome, and can be crosslinked to nascent secretory proteins within the ribosomal exit tunnel  <cit> , but the principal ribosome receptor in the er membranen is sec61p  <cit> . the cytosolic domain of sec61ß also serves as gdp-exchange factor for the ß subunit of srp receptor in the er membrane  <cit> . in addition to its function in translocation, sbh <dig> also interacts both genetically and physically with the exocyst, a protein complex required for fusion of secretory transport vesicles with the plasma membrane  <cit> . this function is specific to sbh1p; overexpression of sbh2p, which is 50% identical to sbh1p at the amino acid level, does not suppress exocyst mutations  <cit> . mammalian sec61ß also binds to the exocyst  <cit> . sbh1p interaction with the exocyst requires its cytosolic domain, but the function of the interaction remains unknown  <cit> .

mammalian sec61ß has been shown to be phosphorylated  <cit> . in isolated er membranes phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase c, and phosphorylation of er-derived microsomes enhances cotranslational protein translocation into these membranes. it was not shown, however, that sec61ß was the protein whose phosphorylation was responsible for enhanced translocation. sec61ß was also found to be phosphorylated in intact cells, but the kinase and the site of phosphorylation were not identified. the only other subunit of the sec complex which is known to be phosphorylated is sec63p  <cit> . phosphorylation enhances association of sec63p with sec62p by increasing acidity of the carboxy-terminal region of sec63p, and is mediated by casein kinase  <dig> . whether sec63p phosphorylation has a regulatory function and whether mammalian sec63p is also phosphorylated is unknown so far.

here we set out to investigate the role of phosphorylation in sbh1p function. in purified sec complexes we identified the threonine at position  <dig> as a phosphorylated residue. mutation of t <dig> to alanine, however, did not affect the ability of sbh1p to complement the temperature-sensitivity of a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain, and did not result in detectable hypophosphorylation of the cellular pool of the protein. comparison to multiple phosphoproteome data revealed additional phosphorylation sites in sbh1p which were modified in several combinations. analyzing the entire sec complex by mass spectrometry we were surprised to find that both sbh1p and sec62p were n-acetylated although this modification has been shown to inhibit targeting to the er  <cit> . mutation of the n-acetyl acceptor site in sec62p did not affect post-translational protein import into the er. a strain deleted for the enzymatically active subunit of the nata complex, ard1p , which is responsible for n-acetylation of sec62p and sbh1p, showed growth defects that were exacerbated at low and high temperature. the strain, however, displayed no measurable protein translocation defects, and both sec62p and sbh1p were stably expressed in the Δard <dig> strain, suggesting that n-acetylation of these proteins by nat a is not essential for protein import into the er.

RESULTS
sbh1p can be phosphorylated at the er membrane
when dog pancreas microsomes are incubated with γ-32p]atp er-associated protein kinase c phosphorylates mammalian sec61ß  <cit> . we asked whether the yeast orthologue of sec61ß, sbh1p, could similarly be phosphorylated in a cell-free system. we prepared microsomes from a wildtype yeast strain and incubated 5eq membranes in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, gtp, and calcium with  <dig> μci γ-32p]atp for  <dig> min at 30°c. membranes were lysed in sds and sbh1p and sss1p immunoprecipitated. as shown in figure 1a, the sbh1p antibody, but not the sss1p antibody, precipitated a radiolabelled protein from the lysed microsomes. the sbh1p antibody was raised against the first  <dig> amino acids of sbh1p. on western blots it also recognizes the sbh <dig> protein , but in the immunoprecipitation we detected a single phosphate-labelled protein . in order to investigate whether this protein corresponded to sbh1p or sbh2p, we prepared microsomes from strains in which either the sbh <dig> or the sbh <dig> gene had been deleted, labelled the microsomes with γ-32p]atp as above, and immunoprecipitated sbh proteins. as shown in figure 1a  we could only detect phosphate-labelled sbh1p in our membranes. we conclude that sbh1p, like sec61ß in mammalian membranes, can be phoshorylated at the er membrane.


mutation of predicted sbh1p phosphorylation sites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> & t33
gruss and colleagues  <cit>  had not identified the sites phosphorylated in dog sec61ß. we looked for potential phosphorylation sites in sbh1p using the netphos programme. we found three phosphorylation sites in the cytosolic domain of sbh1p , two of which were conserved in dog sec61ß. yeast strains which lack both sbh <dig> and sbh <dig> are temperature-sensitive at 37°c, but yeast tolerate deletion of either gene without measurable translocation defects  <cit> . we asked whether mutation of the potential phosphorylation sites in sbh <dig> affected the ability of the gene to complement the growth defect of a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain at 37°c. amino acids s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> in sbh1p were changed to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting genes expressed in Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> yeast. as shown in figure 2a, all mutants were still able to promote growth of this strain at 37°c. overexpression of all mutants also still rescued exocyst mutants sec8- <dig> and sec15- <dig> . we then asked whether the mutant proteins were still phosphorylatable. membranes were prepared from each strain, labelled with γ-32p]atp, and sbh1p was immunoprecipitated. as shown in figure 2b  all mutant proteins were still phosphorylated to levels comparable with wildtype protein. a constant phospho-protein signal could have been the result of overexpression of hyposphosphorylated sbh1p. immunoblotting on the membranes, however, revealed that expression levels of wildtype and the individual mutant proteins were comparable . we conclude that none of the identified potential phosphorylation sites  in the cytosolic domain of sbh1p is the sole phosphate-acceptor site in the protein.


we then combined the mutations of the individual potential phosphorylation sites in pairs or in a triple alanine mutant. as shown in figure 2c even the triple alanine mutant still complemented growth of Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> cells at high temperature. the mutant protein could still be phosphorylated at the er membrane in vitro to levels comparable with wildtype sbh1p . phosphate-labelling of intact yeast cells also revealed that triplea-sbh1p was phosphorylated like wildtype sbh1p, and expressed at the same level . sec63p, a known phosphoprotein subunit of the sec complex, served as a control in this experiment . we conclude that s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> are not the phosphate acceptor sites, or not the only phosphate acceptor sites in sbh1p.

when we used a different prediction programme, scan prosite, we were able to identify an additional phosphorylation site in the cytosolic domain of sbh1p at t <dig> . mutation of t <dig> to alanine on its own or in combination with s21a, s38a and s44a, however, did not affect complementation activity of the mutant sbh1p, nor its phosphorylation level .

identification of t <dig> as phospho-acceptor site in sbh1p by mass spectrometry
we then purified the sec complex from er membrane to analyze sbh1p posttranslational modifications by mass spectrometry. microsomes  from a strain in which sss1p was tagged with the ha-epitope were lysed in digitonin, the resulting lysate subjected to ultracentrifugation for  <dig> h at  <dig>  g to remove membrane debris and ribosomes, and sss1p-ha and associated proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. proteins were resolved by sds-page on a 15% gel and the band corresponding to sbh1p was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. as shown in figure  <dig> we were able to identify a single phosphopeptide in the cytosolic domain of sbh1p with the phosphate attached to t <dig>  with the exception of a small peptide including s <dig>  our analysis covered the entire cytosolic domain of sbh1p. we repeated the purification, but were still unable to get data from the peptide including s <dig>  we conclude that sbh1p when associated with the sec <dig> complex is phosphorylated on t <dig> 


mutation of t <dig> does not interfere with sbh1p function
next we mutated sbh1p t <dig> to alanine either alone or in combination with s <dig>  both the single  and the double mutant were still able to complement growth of the Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain at high temperature . in phosphate-labelling experiments, the t5a mutant showed a weaker signal in autoradiography , but the corresponding protein levels also were reduced , thus the mutation did not result in a hypophosphorylated protein. adding the s27a mutation had no additional effects on phosphorylation or expression . this suggest that the kinase responsible for phosphorylating t <dig> is promiscuous and can use other residues in the vicinity, perhaps the serine at position  <dig> .


the reduced signal in the sbh1p western blot of the t5a mutant suggested that the t5a mutation destabilizes sbh1p. this would not necessarily manifest itself in a functional defect, as sbh <dig> expressed from its own promoter can complement the growth defect of Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> yeast at 37°c although it is only expressed at about 10% of sbh1p . we performed a cycloheximide chase to investigate t5a sbh1p stability. cells were incubated with cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, aliquots were taken at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min, cells lysed and sbh1p detected by immunoblotting. as shown in figure 4c both wildtype and t5a sbh1p were stable for the entire chase period.

another potential explanation for the reduced signal in t5a sbh1p western blots is that our antibody does not recognize the mutant protein as well as the wildtype. we raised the antibody against the first  <dig> amino acids of sbh1p . the antibody recognizes both sbh1p and sbh2p on blots , but we were unable to precipitate phosphate-labelled sbh2p  or unlabelled sbh2p  using the antibody, suggesting that it recognizes sbh1p better than sbh2p. within the first  <dig> amino acids the only region that differs between the two proteins is amino acids 2– <dig> . if this region is decisive for interaction with the antibody, mutation of t <dig> to a may result in the reduced signal that we see in immunoprecipitations of the phosphorylated mutant protein and since the blots shown in figure 4b are on the immunoprecipitated material, this would also explain the reduced signal for t5a sbh1p.

phosphorylation of sbh1p is dynamic
phosphorylation is often used to regulate protein activity or interaction with specific partners and is therefore usually reversible  <cit> . we asked whether phosphorylation of sbh1p was transient. we labelled sbh1Δsbh <dig> cells with 32p]phosphate for  <dig> min, chased for up to  <dig> min and immunoprecipitated sbh1p from the lysed cells. we found that while sbh1p itself was more or less stable over this period, the phosphate on the protein had a half live of approximately  <dig> min . as a control we immunoprecipitated another phosphorylated subunit of the sec complex, sec63p, and found that the phosphate on sec63p was stable . we conclude that the phosphate on sbh1p is turned over and is therefore likely to have a regulatory function.


we found that sbh1p was phosphorylated on t <dig> . while sbh <dig> homologues are present in all eukaryotes, the cytosolic domain of the protein is not highly conserved and there has been speculation that it might serve different functions in different organisms  <cit> . upon sequence comparison, we found that t <dig> is conserved in mammals and s. cerevisiae, but not strictly in birds, and not at all in other vertebrates, flies, nematodes, plants, or other yeasts . in all these organisms, however, there are phosphorylatable serine residues in close proximity, so a position close to the n-terminus could potentially be phosphorylated in all sbh1p orthologues. strikingly, the proline in position  <dig> is conserved yeast, all vertebrates, and even in drosophila, whereas the proline in position  <dig>  which is part of the recognition sequence for proline-directed kinases, is only present in the species that also have a phosphorylatable residues in position  <dig>   <cit> .

sbh1p and sec62p are n-acetylated
because n-acetylation of soluble secretory proteins has been shown to interfere with their targeting to the er membrane  <cit> , we were surprised to find that sbh1p is also acetylated at its n-terminus . the effect of n-acetylation on membrane proteins in particular has not been explored so far. since the sec complex subunits are relatively long-lived, and the modification can contribute to protein stability  <cit> , we asked whether other subunits of the complex were also n-acetylated. we repeated the purification of the sec complex as above. this time, all bands corresponding to sec complex subunits were excised, proteins digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides analyzed by mass spectrometry. as shown in figure 6a we were able to identify all subunits of the sec complex. of these, only sbh1p and sec62p were n-acetylated. since sec62p is an essential protein required for posttranslational protein import into the er, we asked whether n-acetylation is important for its function. we mutated the serine in position  <dig> to tyrosine, which cannot be n-acetylated  <cit> . the sec62-s2y protein was able to complement the growth defect in the temperature-sensitive sec62- <dig> mutant . a sensitive marker for posttranslational protein import defects into the er is the cytosolic accumulation of the precursor of the alpha factor pheromone, prepro-alpha factor . the precursor is undetectable in wildtype cells  because it is rapidly translocated into the er, transported to the golgi and proteolytically cleaved. in translocation defective cells  ppaf accumulates. transformation of sec62- <dig> cells with a plasmid containing wildtype sec <dig> alleviates the translocation defect . transformation with a plasmid containing the n-acetylation mutant sec62-sy <dig> complements the translocation defect like the wildtype gene . we conclude that n-acetylation is not essential for sec62p function.


inactivation of nata reduces growth, but not er translocation
processing of the n-terminal methionine and the amino acid in position  <dig> determine which n-acetylation complex can modify a protein  <cit> . n-terminal processing and a serine in position  <dig> as in sbh1p and sec62p leads to n-acetylation by the nata complex  <cit> . the gene encoding the enzymatically active subunit of nata, ard <dig>  is not essential, but if n-acetylation played a subtle role in sec complex function one would expect the Δard <dig> strain to have growth defects exacerbated at higher or lower temperatures. we tested growth of a Δard <dig> strain at 20°c, 30°c, and 37°c on solid media  and by measuring growth curves in liquid media . we found that the Δard <dig> strain had a longer generation time than the wildtype at all temperatures tested, and that this defect was more pronounced a low and high temperatures . we then asked whether the growth defect was due to a protein translocation defect into the er. to examine translocation we transformed the Δard <dig> and the corresponding wildtype strain with reporter plasmids encoding fusions of the gene for a cotranslationally translocated protein, pho8p, or a posttranslationally translocated protein, cpy, to ura <dig>  in cells competent for translocation, the fusion proteins are efficiently translocated into the er, and because the cells are chromosomally ura <dig>  they cannot grow in the absence of uracil  <cit> . in cells defective in co- or posttranslational import into the er, the corresponding substrate accumulates in the cytosol, and because the ura3p part of the fusion protein is now in the appropriate location for its function, these cells can grow without uracil. as shown in figure 7b, Δard <dig> cells are fully competent for protein translocation into the er in contrast to the sec61- <dig> mutant which has a cotranslational import defect  <cit> . this is consistent with forte et al.  <cit>  who found no posttranslational import defect in Δard <dig> cells by pulse-chase.


n-acetylation frequently enhances protein stability  <cit> . we asked whether sec62p stability was compromised in the Δard <dig> strain performing a cycloheximide chase experiment. samples were taken up to  <dig> min, cells lysed, and sec62p detected by immunoblotting. we found that sec62p was stable in the Δard <dig> and the wildtype strains for up to  <dig> min . in contrast, mutant sec62p in the sec62- <dig> strain was unstable and rapidly turned over . expression levels of sbh1p in the Δard <dig> strain were also similar to wildtype . we conclude that the growth defect in the Δard <dig> strain is not due to protein instability of sec62p or sbh1p or a protein translocation defect into the er.

discussion
n-acetylation of sec complex subunits
although n-acetylation is a frequent modification  its function is not well understood so far  <cit> . for soluble secretory proteins it had been shown that n-acetylation interferes with their targeting to the er  <cit> . in sec complexes purified using an ha-tagged sss1p, however, we found that in both sec62p and sbh1p the n-terminal methionine had been cleaved and the following serine n-acetylated . in a genome-wide identification of n-acetylated proteins, sec61p was also found to be modified in the same fashion   <cit> . we likely missed the n-acetylated n-terminus of sec61p because the trypsin digest prior to mass spectromety resulted in a very short n-terminal peptide. effects of n-acetylation on protein stability, and on protein-protein interactions have been reported  <cit> . mutation of the n-acetyl acceptor serine in position  <dig> in sec62p had no effect on its function in protein translocation into the er, however, and deletion of the enzymatically active subunit of the nata complex, Δard <dig>  did not affect sec62p stability over a  <dig> min chase period . mutation of s <dig> to tyrosine in sec61p had no effect on protein stability at 30°c, but resulted in tunicamycin-sensitivity and temperature sensitivity at 37°c, without growth defects at lower temperatures . sbh1p was also stably expressed in the Δard <dig> strain , and the Δard <dig> strain showed no gross defects in protein translocation into the er either co- or posttranslationally . our data suggest that n-acetylation of sec62p and sbh1p is not important for protein stability, and not essential for their function in protein import into the er. n-acetylation of sec61p affects its function at high temperature , and will be investigated in more detail in the future. but since our sec61-s2y mutant was temperature-sensitive only at 37°c, whereas the Δard <dig> strain had growth defects at all temperatures tested , it is likely that defects in other nata substrates contribute to this Δard <dig> phenotype.

as three transmembrane subunits of the sec complex in the er are n-acetylated, this argues against a general interference of this modification with protein targeting to the er. in fact, forte and colleagues  <cit>  had only demonstrated an interference of n-acetylation with posttranslational targeting of soluble proteins to the yeast er. for cotranslational targeting, the authors had found that these proteins, even if they contained an n-terminal sequence compatible with n-acetylation, were usually not modified  <cit> . the authors argued that competition of nata and srp for their ribosomal binding site would lead to presence of only one or the other near the exit tunnel of the large ribosomal subunit and thus in the presence of srp nata-mediated n-acetylation could not occur  <cit> . here we find that two cotranslationally er-targeted transmembrane proteins, sec61p and sec62p, are n-acetylated on a nata consensus sequence , suggesting that the binding of nata and srp to the nascent protein are limiting, not their binding to the ribosome. in soluble secretory proteins with n-terminal signal sequences srp and nata compete with each other for binding to the the nascent protein n-terminus. in transmembrane proteins like the sec complex subunits the binding sites for nata and srp in the nascent protein are physically separated from each other, so both can bind. we also found the tail-anchored protein sbh1p n-acetylated which shows that n-acetylation does not interfere with posttranslational er-targeting by the get machinery. taken together our data and those in forte et al.  <cit>  suggest that n-acetylation only interferes with posttranslational er targeting via the sec <dig> complex.

phosphorylation of sbh1p
sbh1p is a small tail-anchored protein which interacts with multiple partners . it is the only subunit of the sec <dig> channel that is non-essential, so it likely enhances speed of translocation or efficiency of targeting rather than forming a part of the channel proper. this view is supported by the crystal structure of the archaeal secyeg complex, where secg is associated with the periphery of the channel  <cit> . sbh1p also is the only subunit of the sec <dig> complex that has functions outside the protein translocation channel  <cit> . protein-protein interactions can be regulated by covalent modifications such as n-acetylation and phosphorylation  <cit> . phosphorylation in contrast to n-acetylation is reversible and therefore allows flexible regulation of specific interactions depending on specific circumstances.

the cytosolic domain of sbh1p contains several predicted phosphorylation sites, and its mammalian orthologue, sec61ß, had been shown to be phosphorylated, but the modified sites had not been identified, nor had the function of sbh1p phosphorylation been investigated in detail  <cit> . the authors had demonstrated that in vitro phosphorylation of microsomal membranes enhances protein translocation into the er, but since they had found three proteins involved in protein translocation phosphorylated , the contribution of sec61ß phosphorylation to the translocation enhancement remained unclear. when we mutated the predicted phosphorylation sites in sbh1p individually or up to a quadruple combination  to alanine, we did not observe hypophosphorylation of sbh1p, and even the quadruple mutant was still able to complement the temperature-sensitivity of a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain . we therefore purified sbh1p with sec <dig> complexes using membranes from an sss1-ha strain and subjected the purified protein to mass spectrometry analysis. we found that sbh1p when it is part of the sec <dig> complex is phosphorylated on a single site, t <dig> . mutation of t <dig> to alanine, either alone or in combination with the only phosphorylatable residue not covered in our mass spectrometry analysis, s <dig>  did again not result in detectable hypophosphorylation of sbh1p in yeast cells, or in loss of function in translocation . mutation of t <dig> did result in a reduced signal on western blots, but because t <dig> is part of the peptide against which our antibody was raised, it remains unclear whether this reduction in signal is due to decreased interaction with the antibody, or to lower expression of t5a sbh1p . in a cycloheximide chase experiment, however, t5a sbh1p was stable .

our data and a survey of the phosphoproteome data bases show that several sites can be phosphorylated in sbh1p . with one exception  <cit> , the investigators all found phosphorylation of multiple  sites of sbh1p, but while there was overlap between sites found modified in an individual experiment, in no case was there identification of an identical set of phosphorylated residues  <cit>  . modified phosphorylation sites in sbh1p occurred in two clusters, one proximal to the n-terminus  and a second one closer to the transmembrane domain of sbh1p  . mutation of s <dig>  but not of s <dig>  to alanine led to complete destabilization of sbh1p in our hands, and the mutant was one of the few that was unable to complement growth of a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain . by contrast, mutation of s <dig> to aspartate left the protein stable and complementation competent .


* extremely low expression levels.

phosphorylation of s <dig> of sbh1p was detected in one study  <cit> . this is unusual because s <dig> at the n-terminus of sbh1p is also n-acetylated , and there are no reports that we are aware of of n-termini that have both modifications. one possible explanation is that there are two populations of sbh1p, one which is phosphorylated at s <dig>  the other n-acetylated at s <dig>  but mutation of s <dig> to alanine destabilized all sbh1p dramatically and made it close to undetectable on western blots, although the low amount of residual protein was still able to complement the growth defect of Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> yeast . alanine is less efficiently n-acetylated than serine, but the fact that sbh1p is stable in a Δard <dig> strain  suggests strongly that it is the lack of phosphorylation that is critical in the s2a mutant  <cit> . sbh1p is a tail-anchored protein which is inserted into the er membrane posttranslationally after dissociation from the ribosome, and the nata complex is ribosome-associated  <cit> . perhaps s <dig> is n-acetylated during biosynthesis and phosphorylation of the same residue early during biogenesis stabilizes the protein in a specific conformation that improves its interaction with chaperones or the insertion machinery in the er membrane. if phosphorylation of s <dig> were important during biogenesis only, the phosphate might be removed once the protein is inserted into the er membrane which would explain why in most studies s <dig> was not found phosphorylated .

phosphorylation of t <dig> of sbh1p was detected in two phosphoproteome studies by mass spectrometry, but in both cases other sites were also found to be modified  <cit> . the principal difference between these studies and ours is that in the phosphoproteome analyses total cellular sbh1p was detected, so when multiple sites were found phosphorylated it is not clear whether these were in the same molecule or in different populations of sbh1p. in our work, we identified t5p sbh1p in sec <dig> complexes that were either free or associated with the sec <dig> complex . we have no information on the phosphorylation status of sbh1p in ribosome-associated sec <dig> complexes, of exocyst-associated and of free sbh1p. comparison of our own and the phosphoproteome data suggest that the phosphorylation state of and sites used in sbh1p may differ depending on its interaction partners, and/or on growth conditions.

the kinases modifying sbh1p may include proline directed kinases like cdc <dig> for t <dig>  and perhaps casein kinase  <dig>  for the membrane proximal residues s <dig> and s <dig>  <cit> . the latter do not fulfil the consensus sequence for ck <dig> modification, but ck <dig> has been shown to phosphorylate other residues in non-consensus contexts and ck <dig> modifies sec63p, which would bring it into close proximity with sbh1p in the sec complex  <cit> . in our mutagenesis studies, we never saw hypophosphorylation attributable to mutation of a specific residue, even when we mutated all available serines and threonines in the cytosolic domain of sbh1p individually, or when we mutated several sites in combination . kinases in yeast tend to be promiscuous, however, and if their actual target residue is missing they can phosphorylate other serine or threonine residues in the vicinity  <cit> . promiscuous phosphorylation may therefore be part of the explanation for the lack of hypophosphorylation in the t5a mutant.

mammalian sec61ß  has also been found in several phosphoproteome analyses to be modified on multiple sites, but the pattern of phosphorylation of sec61ß was different from sbh1p . only some these these sites are conserved in yeast including t <dig> , and of these only t <dig> was found phosphorylated in yeast . when gruss and colleagues investigated the phosphorylation of mammalian sec61ß, they did not identify the modified residues, but found after tryptic digest and phosphopeptide mapping that a single peptide was predominantly phosphorylated . from the distribution of trypsin cleavage sites and phosphorylated residues this peptide is almost certainly identical to the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of sec61ß which includes t <dig> and two serine residues which were found to be phosphorylated in phospho-proteome studies .

phosphorylation of the cellular pool of sbh1p was dynamic  in contrast to phosphorylation of sec63p , thus phosphorylation of sbh1p has the potential to regulate its interactions with its various partners. phosphorylation at specific sites may either enhance a specific interaction or prevent it  <cit> . the phosphate that we found on t <dig> may prevent binding of the sbh1p cytosolic domain to the ribosome when the sec <dig> complex is associated with the sec <dig> complex. based on crosslinking experiments to nascent chains the n-terminus of sbh1p can reach into the peptide exit tunnel of the large ribosomal subunit  <cit> . phosporylation of t <dig>  which adds bulk and two negative charges to a position fixed by two flanking prolines, will almost certainly reduce access of the sbh1p n-terminus to the peptide exit tunnel and may at the same time reduce affinity of sbh1p and the sec <dig> complex for the ribosome. kinases frequently are dependent on each other  <cit> , so phosphorylation of t <dig> may enhance phosphorylation of additional sites in sbh1p when it has dissociated from the sec <dig> complex which may signal to the srp receptor that this translocon is unoccupied and available to receive a new nascent chain . interaction with the srp receptor may then trigger dephosphorylation of t <dig> and allow sbh1p to bind to the ribosome again. other scenarios in which t <dig> phosphorylation regulates interaction of sbh1p with the sec <dig> complex, promotes interaction of sbh1p with the sec <dig> complex, or prevents interaction with the exocyst are also plausible. in sbh2p, which forms a strictly cotranslational translocon with the sec61p homologue ssh1p and does not interact with the exocyst, the threonine in position  <dig> is not conserved . t <dig> phosphorylation is therefore likely to have an effect on interactions that are specific to sbh1p, i.e. interaction with sec61p, with the sec <dig> complex or with the exocyst.

the n-terminal cytosolic domain of sbh1p is predicted to be largely unstructured and indeed in the crystal structure of the archaeal channel the secg cytosolic domain is not visible  <cit> . the sbh1p cytosolic domain also contains a relatively large number of basic amino acids most of which are conserved between yeast and dog . one conceivable effect of t <dig> phosphorylation is a folding back of the sbh1p n-terminus and interaction of the negatively charged phospho-t <dig> with one of the basic patches more proximal to the membrane . this phosphorylation-induced structure may then promote or prevent interaction with known sbh1p binding partners, and/or with additional kinases. the prolines flanking t <dig> may also be subject to cis-trans isomerization by phosphate-directed prolyl isomerases like pin1p which may help the phosphorylated sbh1p n-terminus to acquire its functionally relevant structure  <cit> .

the phosphorylation site at t <dig> almost certainly has an interesting role, as both the site and its flanking prolines are conserved between s. cerevisiae and mammals , but not xenopus, fish, invertebrate metazoa, or other yeasts . kinases evolved largely after the development of metazoa, so phosphorylation sites, kinases, and the actual use of the phosphorylation sites are generally poorly conserved between yeast and mammals  <cit> . in two birds, chicken  and zebrafinch , the residues surrounding the t <dig> phospho-acceptor site are conserved  and in chicken, t <dig> is replaced by a phosphorylatable serine, whereas in zebrafinch t <dig> is replaced by asparagine . altogether the data suggest that the n-terminus of sec61ß proteins is evolving rapidly, and the fact that the ptp motif occurs in yeast and again in some birds and all mammals suggests a case of convergent evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
as three subunits of the er-resident sec complex are n-acetylated, the modification per se is unlikely to interfere with targeting to the er. that n-acetylation can occur on two cotranslationally targeted transmembrane proteins, sec61p and sec62p, but not on cotranslationally targeted soluble proteins  <cit> , suggests that in signal-sequence bearing proteins binding of nata and srp to the nascent protein are limiting, not their binding to the ribosome. since we also found the tail-anchored protein sbh1p n-acetylated, our data and those in forte et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that n-acetylation exclusively interferes with posttranslational er targeting via the sec <dig> complex.

our phosphosite analysis of sbh1p suggests that several sbh1p populations exist in the cell which are phosphorylated at different sites in different combinations. the phosphate on t <dig> of sbh1p must play a particularly important sbh1p-specific role since the site evolved twice independently, in s. cerevisiae and in mammals, and is not present in sbh2p. phosphorylation is a reversible modification known to affect protein-protein interactions, thus it is likely that the phosphorylation status of an individual sbh1p molecule determines its interaction partners, and vice versa. in the future we will therefore investigate the phosphorylation status of exocyst- and ribosome-associated sbh1p by mass spectrometry, and subsequently make the readout for functional analysis of specific phospho-site mutations specific to the complex in which they were found to be modified.
