BACKGROUND
hemoglobins  represent a large ubiquitous group of proteins found in all kingdoms of life  <cit> . in plants, there are three major groups:  symbiotic or leghemoglobins, facilitating oxygen diffusion to nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules of plants  non-symbiotic hemoglobins  found in numerous species, and  the poorly characterized group of truncated hemoglobins  <cit> . the nshbs in turn are divided into class- <dig>  and class- <dig>  subgroups based on phylogenetic analyses and structural/kinetic properties of the proteins. hb <dig> has a superior affinity for oxygen and its expression is induced during hypoxic stress  <cit> . notably, its overexpression in plants was shown to enable the cell to maintain high atp levels under hypoxia  <cit> . this finding was later explained by the ability of hb <dig> to detoxify reactive nitrogen species like nitric oxide   <cit> . no is a key signaling molecule involved in multiple processes, like stomatal closure, programmed cell death and pathogen resistance  <cit> . the level of no rises under hypoxia, and is related to the availability of nitrite  <cit> . despite the clear effects of hb <dig> on the abundance of no, the in vivo sources of no, its targets as well as signaling mechanisms are still a matter of debate  <cit> .

seeds of crop species experience a regular oxygen deficiency during both development and germination  <cit> . this leads to atp limitation and subsequently, to a restriction of high energy-demanding processes like cell division, growth and storage product synthesis  <cit> . oxygen limitation is in part caused by the high diffusional impedance of certain seed structures. thus, even the tiny seeds of arabidopsis thaliana operate close to the edge of hypoxia. consequently, a moderate decrease in atmospheric oxygen concentration to about half saturation already induces clear metabolic restrictions in arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of the seeds' response to hypoxia might resemble those of other plant organs  <cit>  and tissue types  <cit>  of arabidopsis, but detailed transcriptomic studies are lacking.

based on a series of in vitro experiments, we recently proposed that the steady state level of no in seeds acts to integrate carbon and energy metabolism  <cit> . upon application of either no scavengers or no inducing compounds, seeds responded with alterations in both oxygen uptake and metabolic activity evident at both the transcript and metabolite level. congruently, respiratory activity of isolated seed mitochondria showed clear responses to no/nitrite  <cit> . however, the extent to which such in vitro studies mirror the in vivo situation can always be questioned. here, we used the non-symbiotic hemoglobin athb <dig> to manipulate endogenous levels of no in seeds. the athb <dig>  was overexpressed under the control of the seed-specific leb <dig> promoter in arabidopsis thaliana. comparative analyses of both transcripts and metabolites were performed with wild type  and transgenic plants grown under standard conditions as well as under moderate hypoxic stress treatment. results indicate that athb <dig> overexpression led to several alterations in transcriptional and metabolic networks, resulting in improved seed yield .

RESULTS
overexpression of athb <dig> is targeted to seed and increases seed weight
we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing the endogenous athb <dig> under the control of the seed-specific leb <dig> promoter  <cit> . northern blot analysis of siliques from homozygous t <dig> plants demonstrated significant athb <dig> expression, whereas in wt plants the endogenous athb <dig> expression was not detectable under standard conditions . rt-pcr analysis showed that, overexpression of athb <dig> under the control of the leb <dig> promoter was restricted to siliques/seeds in the transgenic plants . comparison of manually isolated seeds with whole siliques  revealed that leb4-driven expression is mainly localized in seeds in agreement with previous results  <cit> . to avoid any stress-induced artefacts that might be induced by dissection of seeds from the siliques, whole siliques were used for further studies

athb <dig> overexpression did not alter the vegetative growth of transgenic plants. also timing of developmental programmes, like induction of flowering and silique development were not affected by transgene expression. interestingly, mature seeds of transgenic plants revealed a higher weight  whereas seed number and composition were unaffected.

overexpression of athb <dig> reduces the endogenous level of nitric oxide in seeds
a qualitative fluorescence assay with diaminofluoresceine-2-diacetate  was used for detection of endogenous no in wt and athb <dig> embryos under standard and hypoxic stress conditions.

to induce moderate hypoxic stress in the seeds, intact plants were treated with artificial air mixes containing only  <dig>  kpa oxygen  for one hour. seeds of wt plants showed a slight induction of athb <dig> expression under these conditions , but its expression level was still much lower than in the transgenic plants. microarray results confirmed the higher abundance of athb <dig> mrna in transgenics under hypoxia .

under standard growth conditions, no was not detectable in the embryos of either wt or athb <dig> plants using the fluorescence assay. possibly, the steady state level of no was below the detection limit of the assay. under moderate hypoxia, wt showed a clear fluorescence signal , while athb <dig> overexpressors did not . this indicated strongly decreased no levels in the latter. thus, the transgenic approach resulted in lower levels of no. the induction of athb <dig> expression  and enhanced no emission  in wt further indicated that the moderate stress treatment was sufficient to induce hypoxia in seeds.

experimental set up for microarray analysis
to assess changes in gene expression in seeds/siliques due to athb <dig> overexpression in detail, we focused on line l1- <dig>  which showed the strongest transgene expression. six other independent transgenic lines were involved in further studies .

wt and transgenic plants were exposed to moderate hypoxia  or normoxia  for one hour. three biological replicates were used for hybridization to affymetrix ath <dig> arrays. a cluster dendrogram of transcript signal intensities from the  <dig> arrays showed a high reproducibility of the biological replicates from each data set , and indicated a greater influence of the genotype than the treatment on transcriptional profiles . transcript analysis by qrt-pcr showed a high correlation  with the microarray data, confirming the reliability of the data .

we compared the transcriptome of wt and athb <dig> siliques/seeds under control and hypoxic conditions, as well as the hypoxic responses in each genotype. differentially expressed genes were extracted from the data base by applying the following cutoffs: a fold-change of > <dig> and a p-value of < <dig> . a total of  <dig>  genes were identified as differentially expressed in all of the comparisons. differentially expressed genes were grouped into eight clusters , classified into functional groups using the mapman bin code  <cit>  and ordered by pathways. the heat map display in figure  <dig> gives a detailed view of the altered pathways .

to confirm that microarray data of l1- <dig> are reproducible in further transgenic lines, we analyzed the expression of selected genes in six other athb1-overexpressing lines by qrt-pcr . a set of transcripts that have been shown in the microarray analysis to be upregulated by athb <dig> overexpression was selected for qrt-pcr analysis. all of the transgenic lines exhibited an enhanced expression of the genes from representative signaling, redox and metabolic pathways compared to the wt, indicating similar expression profiles due to athb <dig> overexpression in independent transgenic lines.

athb <dig> overexpression induces stress-related regulatory pathways under non-stress conditions
comparison of the transcriptome of wt and athb <dig> overexpressors under control conditions revealed multiple changes . the effects on molecular networks involved in stress responses and signaling were particularly pronounced . wrky and ap2/erebp transcription factors, as well as genes related to hormone metabolism, i.e. abscisic acid , salicylic acid  and jasmonic acid , were found to be upregulated in athb <dig> seeds. moreover, many genes involved in signaling processes, like mapk kinases and receptor kinases, and in redox/stress-related processes were strongly induced. this trend was also confirmed by analysis of differentially expressed genes for indicative over- and underrepresented gene ontology categories . upregulated genes in athb1-overexpressing plants showed a strong enrichment of go categories involved in stress responses .

genes with log <dig> signal ratios >  <dig> and p-values <  <dig>  between wt and athb1-overexpressing plants under control and hypoxic conditions and after hypoxic treatment of each genotype were extracted from the data base.

among transcription factors, four transcripts, encoding wrky  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were significantly upregulated. wrky genes have been shown to play a role in hypoxic responses of different cell types of arabidopsis  <cit> . prominent differences in hormone metabolism were observed for aba, sa and auxin-related genes. a strong upregulation of nced <dig> was accompanied by preferential expression of transcripts encoding aba-responsive proteins . the elevation of transcripts involved in aba metabolism/signaling is consistent with an overrepresentation of abre binding sites in the 5'-flanking regions of athb <dig> coexpressed genes . auxin transport and signaling is commonly downregulated in transgenics. fourteen genes, among them auxin transporter , auxin-induced genes  were strongly downregulated, whereas two transcripts encoding auxin downregulated protein arg <dig> were upregulated.

overrepresented motifs with p-values < 10e- <dig> were selected for comparative analysis.

genes implicated in signaling pathways, like receptor kinases, wall-associated kinase  <dig>  and mapk kinase  <dig>  were also upregulated compared to wt. wak <dig> is a transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic ser/thr kinase domain and an extracellular domain bound to the pectin fraction of cell walls  <cit> , thus enabling communication between cell wall and cytoplasm. phosphorylation via waks has been shown to play a pivotal role in cell wall metabolism  <cit> , which was significantly altered by athb <dig> overexpression. wak <dig> expression is induced by sa treatment  <cit> , thus, higher expression of wak <dig> and two s-adenosyl-l-methionine:carboxyl methyltransferases indicates an involvement of sa signaling in the regulatory networks controlled by athb <dig>  in addition, the expression of  <dig> transcripts encoding receptor kinases, such as transmembrane kinase rlk <dig> and other leucine-rich repeat family proteins as well as ser/thr kinases, revealed the presence of different signaling pathways. interestingly, rlk <dig>  has recently been shown to be involved in the control of seed germination and tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . using genetic approaches the authors provided evidence for a positive correlation of rlk <dig> expression and enhanced tolerance against h2o <dig> 

transcripts encoding proteins involved in redox homeostasis, such as manganese superoxide dismutase  and two glutathione-s-transferases, were upregulated in athb <dig> overexpressors. this was accompanied by higher expression of defence-related proteins, i.e. dehydrins and major latex proteins  .

ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is essential for plant development and responses to environmental stimuli  <cit> . athb <dig> induced the expression of three ring finger e <dig> ligases of the c3ch4-type  and two f-box proteins  . ring finger ligases and e <dig> ligases from the skp <dig>  f-box  complex play an essential role in auxin metabolism by degrading aux/iaa proteins, and thereby regulating concentrations of iaa  <cit> . this is probably linked to downregulation of auxin transport and signaling in athb <dig> plants.

athb <dig> overexpression in seeds alters expression of genes involved in primary metabolism
athb <dig> overexpression induces various changes in transcripts related to carbohydrate, cell wall, n- and lipid metabolism, as well as potentially associated transporter gene activities and photosynthesis. as deduced from go analysis of transcript data, the cell wall was the most affected cellular compartment in athb <dig> seeds showing a clear underrepresentation . other decreased biological processes are linked to cell wall biogenesis and modification. this is illustrated by the concurrent downregulation of more than  <dig> cell wall-related genes encoding cellulose synthases, arabinogalactan-proteins , pectinesterases, expansins, xyloglucan-xyloglucosyl transferases and polygalacturonases . this indicates a strong repression of cell wall synthesis, cell wall modification, pectin degradation, cell expansion and cell wall turnover. two transcripts  encoding class ii trehalose-6-p synthase/phosphatase  were preferentially expressed in athb <dig> plants. these transcripts are also potentially linked to cell wall metabolism, as it was found that perturbation of trehalose metabolism in embryos of the tps <dig> mutant leads to changes in cell wall composition and thickness  <cit> . lipid metabolism also showed transcriptional alterations; fatty acid elongation and desaturation were activated but transcripts involved in squalene and steroid metabolism were repressed. in addition, transcripts for malate synthase and isocitrate lyase  were upregulated in athb <dig> seeds. furthermore, transcripts encoding the 4fe-4s cluster protein of photosystem i and key enzymes of the photorespiratory pathway  were downregulated.

nitrogen metabolism appears to be affected in athb <dig> seeds based on the downregulation of nitrate reductase  <dig>  and nitrite reductase  <dig> . several transcripts involved in amino acid metabolism differed significantly between transgenic and wt .

several transporter gene activities were commonly downregulated in athb <dig> seeds, namely those involved in sugar, amino acid and oligopeptide transport . most of these are proton-coupled transporters. in addition, five genes from different subgroups of the aquaporin family were downregulated. these genes play a role in nutrient flow and/or are implicated in remobilization  <cit> .

changed gene interactions due to athb <dig> overexpression point to alterations in cell wall metabolism
to infer gene-to-gene interactions we used the mrnet approach which extracts statistical dependencies between genes  <cit> . the reconstructed network of gene interference for the top  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed between wt and athb <dig> overexpressing seeds under control conditions showed clear differences . in wt, the gene encoding fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein  <dig>  was the central hub. agps, such as fla <dig>  play a role in plant cell elongation/cell wall biogenesis, and are assumed to act as signal molecules  <cit> . proteins containing fasciclin domains have also been shown to function as adhesion molecules in a broad spectrum of organisms  <cit> . there were multiple interactions of this hub with genes encoding proteins localized to the cell wall , proline-rich protein  <dig>  and acid phosphatase class b family protein) or otherwise involved in extracellular matrix modifications . most of the genes are implicated in stress-responses and related to hormone  action. overexpression of athb <dig> directly or indirectly perturbed the strong multiple interactions of the hub gene fla <dig>  shifting the main regulatory point to atprp <dig>  it has been shown, that atprp <dig> is one of the key genes involved in cell specification  <cit> . cell specification in the embryo might be coupled to maturation processes, which are characterized by high storage- but extremely low mitotic-activity. downregulated expression of atprp <dig>  in athb <dig> plants might therefore indicate decelerated cell specification and thus, an extented growth phase.

evaluation of adaptive stress responses in wild type seeds
most of the adaptive responses in wt seeds have also been described for shoots and roots of arabidopsis plants. mustroph et al.  <cit>  identified a core set of  <dig> translated hypoxia-induced mrnas in  <dig> different arabidopsis cell populations. from this core set,  <dig> genes  were also found to be upregulated in seeds, indicating similar adaptation strategies to hypoxia regardless of tissue/organ identity. the possible induction of the glyoxylate cycle in combination with lipid degradation  was not observed in other arabidopsis tissues and might therefore be seed-specific. the induction of the glyoxylate cycle could represent an alternative mechanism to generate sugars and sustain energy supply under unfavourable conditions in seeds. interestingly, malate synthase and isocitrate lyase are also enhanced in carbon-starved cucumber cotyledons  <cit> . the higher expression of genes involved in sugar, amino acid, oligopeptide and general nutrient  transport in wt  and the significantly reduced sucrose concentrations  indicates nutrient, particularly sugar, depletion in wt upon hypoxia.

in general, wt seeds showed a strong transcriptional and metabolic response to moderate hypoxia. metabolism and signaling of hormones  which are described to be important triggers in response to oxidative stress  <cit>  are strongly induced in seeds. activation of specific transcription factors and signaling pathways nicely illustrates a cross-talk of hormone action and regulatory pathways, particular for ethylene. upregulation of mapkk <dig>  mapk <dig>  accompanied by activation of acc oxidase <dig>  as well as ten members of the ap2/erebp family represents an example how signaling cascades are linked together in adaptive stress responses. experiments with maize suspension cultures showed a correlation of varying class- <dig> hemoglobin levels and changed no concentrations with ethylene formation  <cit> . enhanced ethylene biosynthesis under hypoxia is linked to lower hemoglobin expression, coinciding with the stronger induction of ethylene synthesis and signaling in the wt compared to the athb <dig> plants in our experiments. beside the strong activation of several wrky transcription factors and myb <dig> , transcripts related to redox regulation were clearly induced. rising concentrations of h2o <dig> in wt upon hypoxia correlate with transcriptional activation of several ros generating/scavenging enzymes coinciding with other studies  <cit> . the upregulation of several class ii tps genes and the reduction of trehalose-6-p  levels was part of the hypoxic response in wt . interestingly, t6p metabolism was identified as being part of a hypoxic response that is conserved in some pro- and eukaryotes  <cit> . t6p may be involved in coordination of carbon partitioning between primary metabolism and cell wall synthesis  <cit> . therefore, altered expression of tps genes - together with changes in cell wall metabolism - accentuates the possible role of t6p metabolism in regulation of carbon partitioning. in general, the alterations in regulatory and metabolite pathways provide a framework of seed-specific responses to hypoxia.

athb <dig> overexpression attenuates transcriptional stress responses
under hypoxic stress treatment, a significantly lower number of transcripts exhibited altered expression in athb <dig> compared to wt . consequently, the stress response observed in athb <dig> was much reduced, especially in regulatory/signaling pathways, but also for specific pathways in primary metabolism. transcriptional alterations in wt upon hypoxia partly shared a commonality with those induced by athb <dig> overexpression under control conditions, or with transcripts additionally induced in athb1-overexpressing plants after hypoxia . the moderate hypoxic response in seeds of transgenic plants, in combination with genes induced by athb <dig> overexpression that have been shown to be implicated in the wt hypoxia response, points to a kind of "pre-adaptation" to oxidative stress. among the differences between the two genotypes in their hypoxic responses, several biological processes stand out, namely, stress-related signaling, redox pathways and primary/energy metabolism . these differences are discussed in detail below.

first, hypoxia induced stress-related signaling and redox pathways in wt. go analysis for functional assignments of upregulated genes showed strong overrepresentation of responses to abiotic/biotic stress and other biological processes related to stress responses, especially responses to aba and ja. evaluation of promoter motifs within the 5'-flanking regions of hypoxia-induced genes revealed that w-box, abre, dreb, g-box, myc <dig>  mycaterd <dig>  gadownat, z-box, i-box and evening element motifs were significantly overrepresented. this finding is significant because almost all of these recognition sites have been implicated in hormone signaling  and in general stress responses. in addition to these changes in hormone signaling pathways, transcripts directly involved in biosynthesis of aba, ethylene, ja and sa were commonly upregulated in wt. in contrast genes related to sa, ga and aba metabolism were not induced by hypoxia in athb <dig> plants. in fact, a strong repression of aba synthesis/signaling was evident from the down regulation of nced <dig> and several aba-responsive genes, among them atem <dig> and athva22b . in addition, abre binding site motifs were enriched in the set of downregulated genes in athb <dig> plants after hypoxia . another striking difference between the genotypes is the opposite regulation of transcripts encoding the gibberellin regulated proteins  <dig> and  <dig> ; they are highly upregulated in the wt after hypoxic treatment whereas a strong repression was observed in transgenic seeds. calcium signaling seems to play a role in the hypoxic response of wt, as indicated by the upregulation of six transcripts encoding calmodulins and calmodulin binding proteins, accompanied by an induction of calcium dependent protein kinase and the plastidic ca2+-atpase <dig> . the transcriptional activation of calmodulins which are the primary calcium receptors in plant cells and calcium binding proteins, could serve as substrate for phosphorylation by calcium dependent protein kinases, then activating transcription factors by phosphorylation. altogether this points to existing calcium dependent signaling pathways in the hypoxia response in wild type seeds, which were not observed in athb <dig> overexpressors.

the second major difference between athb1-overexpressing plants and wt concerned primary and energy metabolism. hypoxia induced multiple changes in transcripts related to these processes in wt, but only moderate changes in athb <dig> plants. for example, in wt we encountered a clear induction of glycolysis and fermentation  as well as strongly induced nitrogen assimilation as suggested by preferential expression of nia <dig> and nir <dig>  in wt, cell wall metabolism was downregulated as evidenced by repression of six transcripts encoding pectinesterases and four encoding polygalacturonases, indicating that cell wall metabolism is one of the key processes affected by hypoxia. induction of carbonic anhydrases and genes implicated in lipid degradation and the glyoxylate cycle  was apparent in the wt response but not in athb <dig> plants. the activity of transporter genes is directly linked to primary metabolism. the strong induction of genes encoding proline transporter, pot as well as tip <dig>  and tip <dig>  is also restricted to the hypoxia response in wt and might reflect a higher demand for remobilizing storage compounds and thus, indicating nutrient depletion in wt. the alterations observed in the transgenic plants were restricted to upregulation of glycolysis/fermentation  and a few transcripts related to cell wall degradation.

athb <dig> plants show less pronounced metabolic adjustment under transient hypoxia
the steady state level of amino acids, sugars, metabolic intermediates and h2o <dig> were measured in seeds/siliques of both genotypes under control and hypoxic conditions. under control conditions, the levels of phosphoglycerate and adp-glucose  were higher in wt versus athb <dig> plants, while sucrose and udp-glucose , showed elevated levels in athb <dig> plants . remarkably, the levels of many metabolites changed after hypoxic treatment in wt but were barely altered in athb <dig> plants. in wt plants only, the levels of t6p and sucrose dropped significantly, while pyruvate increased . altogether, the metabolite profiles of the two genotypes illustrated a strong metabolic adjustment in wt in response to moderate hypoxia, whereas in athb <dig> only marginal changes were detected. this differential response was clearly visualized using principal component analysis . transcript data hinted at shifts in ros metabolism in transgenic plants and in the hypoxic response of wt. measurements of h2o <dig> levels in both genotypes under control and hypoxic conditions are consistent with transcriptional activities of h2o <dig> generating and scavenging enzymes. higher concentrations in athb <dig> seeds/siliques compared to wt under control conditions  correlate with preferential expression of mnsod <dig> and glutathione-s-transferases. upon hypoxia, h2o <dig> levels in wt increased but were unchanged in athb <dig> seeds. activation of respiratory burst oxidase homologue d, mnsod <dig>  redoxins, three glutathionine-s-transferases and alternative oxidase 1d  in wt indicates an enhanced ros metabolism under hypoxia.

overexpression of athb <dig> promotes respiration and maintains the energy status under transient hypoxia
to investigate changes in energy metabolism we measured the respiratory activity of developing seeds. under control conditions respiration rates were similar in both genotypes . however, under hypoxia, respiration in athb <dig> plants  was about 40% higher than in wt  pointing to a higher energy supply in the former. indeed, both the adenylate energy status /) and total atp levels were elevated in athb <dig> versus wt under hypoxia .

direct comparison of microarray data from the two genotypes under hypoxic conditions identified only the gamma-subunit of the chloroplast atpase to be significantly upregulated in athb <dig> seeds. screening our dataset for other differentially expressed transcripts involved in electron transport chain/atp synthesis, we found five other transcripts, encoding atp synthase, nadh dehydrogenase, nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, cytochrome c oxidoreductase subunit 5c , with a tendency to higher expression in athb <dig> seeds under hypoxia . these transcripts were found by qrt-pcr analysis to be nearly doubled in the athb1-overexpressing plants compared to wt . altogether, our data suggest that athb <dig> overexpression enables the seed to respire at higher rates especially under hypoxia, thereby increasing the atp supply.

discussion
although non-symbiotic hbs have been widely used in plants to improve tolerance against different stresses, and overexpression of plant hbs showed beneficial effects on energy status and growth under oxygen limitation  <cit> , global information about the molecular mechanisms of athb <dig> function is missing. in this study, we present the first analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms of athb <dig> function and signaling. the hypothetical model deduced from transcriptome, metabolite and physiological analyses summarizes the main effects of athb <dig> overexpression in seeds . two different aspects should be considered when athb <dig> is overexpressed in seeds. first, under normal growth conditions the athb <dig> gene is barely expressed and thus, its overexpression itself might affect seed metabolism. second, non-symbiotic hemoglobins, such as athb <dig>  are able to degrade endogenously formed no  <cit> , which itself can act as a signal molecule. thus, perception of the nitric oxide level in the seed might be altered due to the enzymatic scavenging of no.

athb <dig> overexpression induces stress-related signaling pathways and limits energy-consuming pathways
under control conditions, athb <dig> overexpression activated several stress-related hormonal and signaling pathways. the fact that hormones and other components of signal transduction cascades work downstream of athb <dig> suggests that athb <dig> represents a high ranking signaling component with broad impact on regulatory networks. most prominent was the induction of aba synthesis/signaling, and the general repression of auxin transport/signaling. evidence for induced ethylene and sa signaling came from induced mapkk and wak1-mediated signaling routes.

ros formation also seems to be part of the athb <dig> signaling cascade as transcripts involved in formation and detoxification of h2o <dig> were clearly upregulated. higher h2o <dig> levels in athb <dig> seeds confirmed the transcriptional activities. the pronounced upregulation of these stress-related signaling pathways might act in combination to "pre-adapt" the seeds to hypoxic stress. a role for plant non-symbiotic hemoglobins in redox regulation by improving the antioxidant status was previously hinted at by studies of alfalfa root cultures overexpressing a non-symbiotic hemoglobin  <cit> . hb1-overexpressing lines revealed increased ascorbate levels as well as higher activity of enzymes involved in ros removal. an enhanced oxidative stress tolerance during seed germination of arabidopsis was induced by seed-specific overexpression of antioxidant genes  <cit> . overexpression of mnsod and/or combination with other genes encoding antioxidant enzymes during seed development and germination increased tocopherol contents and antioxidant capacities in mature seeds indicating beneficial effects of activated redox-related pathways on oxidative stress tolerance.

alterations in transcriptional networks were accompanied by changes in primary metabolism. cellulose synthesis, deposition of pectin fragments, incorporation of arabinose-derived sugars and glycosyl-transferring reactions all require energy and use activated nucleotide sugars. thus, cell wall metabolism is clearly dependent on the energy and carbon status of cells. the decrease in transcripts related to cell wall metabolism in athb <dig> plants was the most prominent finding. the analysis of gene-to-gene interactions  indicates that athb1-mediated downregulation of the hub gene fla <dig> is of central importance for the proposed changes in cell wall metabolism. its downregulation might eventually affect cell elongation, energy usage and carbon partitioning. downregulation of cell wall metabolism might represent a major strategy to reduce energy  consumption. higher concentrations of udp-glucose  and sucrose support this idea.

consistent with such energy saving adjustments is the transcriptional repression of proton-coupled transporters and photorespiration. both require energy in the form of atp, and thus, their repression implies a reduction in energy consumption. another striking feature was the downregulation of nia <dig> and nir <dig> by athb <dig> overexpression under control conditions. while this might indicate lower nitrate assimilation , the level of free amino acids was not reduced in transgenic seeds but rather elevated. the shift in nia2/nir <dig> expression could also be linked to no signalling, because nia can produce no from nitrite  <cit> . high no concentrations correlate with nia activation and high nitrite levels  <cit> . genetic studies using the nia1nia <dig> double mutant indicate that nia is a major enzymatic source of no formation in plants  <cit> . subsequently, the coordinated downregulation of nia2/nir <dig> due to athb <dig> overexpression could prevent the accumulation of nitrite and subsequent no formation. this would contribute to the lower steady state no levels in the transgenics .

transcripts encoding key enzymes of photorespiration  were downregulated by athb <dig> overexpression. photorespiration results in a net loss of fixed carbon and energy. the apparent repression of this pathway is a further indication for the energy-saving mode of metabolism. the preferential expression of the β-carbonic anhydrase <dig> in wt might also be related, as this enzyme is known to control co <dig> availability to rubisco and thereby regulate photorespiration  <cit> .

overall, alterations in the metabolism of athb1-overexpressing seeds point to an energy-saving mode of metabolism.

no formation and signaling pathways are repressed by athb <dig> overexpression resulting in improved respiration under stress
athb1-overexpressing seeds showed a much attenuated hypoxic response, with only some of the characteristic pathways being induced under hypoxia . of particular note is the repression of the aba response in the athb <dig> overexpressors, which contrasts with the strong induction observed in wt plants. major differences were also obvious in calcium-dependent and ga-mediated signaling pathways. both seem to play a much less significant role when compared to wt . similarly, at the metabolite level, only minor alterations were apparent in response to hypoxia .

another major difference in the hypoxic response of the two genotypes was the reduction of no levels in athb1-overexpressing seeds. this agrees with previous findings  <cit>  and could be attributable to athb1-mediated degradation of no  <cit>  and/or the restriction of no formation via transcriptional downregulation of nia2/nir <dig>  as athb <dig> overexpression represses nia <dig> and nir <dig> activity under control conditions and especially after hypoxia treatment it could be concluded that no formation is strictly prevented by the reduction of no precursors . studies from wang et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that nia <dig> is responsible for stress-induced no formation in arabidopsis roots. they demonstrated that nia <dig> is phosphorylated by mapk <dig> leading to an increase of nr activity and subsequently no formation. mapk <dig> also interacted with nia <dig> and  <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system implying a role for activation of nia activity. the transcriptional upregulation of mapk <dig> and nia <dig> in wt seeds after hypoxia is in agreement with this finding. possibly mapk <dig> represents a seed-specific transducer of environmental stimuli whereas mapk <dig> is predominantly involved in no biosynthesis in roots. assuming that overexpression of athb <dig> lowered levels of no in planta, the present approach enabled us to discriminate between the more general hypoxia response and the target genes specifically induced by higher no levels in wt. the direct comparison of the transcriptome of both genotypes under hypoxic conditions  revealed differences which might be specifically attributed to no signaling. calcium signaling is linked to no signaling pathways  <cit>  and possibly directly involved in the regulation of hemoglobin expression  <cit> . no induces a rapid increase in calcium concentrations  <cit> , and vice versa  <cit> . this relationship was found in transgenic plants, where both no levels and calcium-dependent signaling were lowered compared to wt. hints for a crosstalk of no and ga signaling came from studies with isolated aleurone cells of arabidopsis. bethke et al.  <cit>  showed that no works upstream of ga in a signaling pathway, supporting our results that ga is possibly linked to higher no levels in wt. no-responsive genes in arabidopsis were identified by microarray analyses using the synthetic no donors snp and nor- <dig>  <cit> . among them genes involved in calcium signaling , sugar and peptide transporters as well as glycosyltransferases which are preferentially expressed in the wt under hypoxic conditions. based on our genetic approach we can separate these transcripts from transcripts of stress-related pathways .

according to our working hypothesis, lower no levels in athb1-overexpressing seeds were expected to stimulate respiration because no inhibits cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . in fact, seeds of the transgenic plants retained respiratory activity as well as higher expression of cox 5c transcripts under hypoxia, whereas the wt switched to a "stress" mode. congruently, there was a preferential expression of other genes related to electron transport chain/atp synthesis in athb <dig> plants. combined with repression of energy-demanding processes  this eventually leads to an improved energy status of cells in athb1-overexpressing seeds.

CONCLUSIONS
according to our previous hypothesis  <cit> , no integrates energy and carbon metabolism, enables the seed to balance its oxygen demand and to avoid self-anoxia. athb <dig> overexpression and/or the subsequent decline in endogenous no levels set the seed in a state of 'alarm'. this is characterized by changes in hormone metabolism, induction of specific signaling pathways and transcription factors, targeted protein degradation and changes in redox-related pathways. these alterations resulted in repression of energy-demanding processes, particular in cell wall metabolism, reflecting the pre-adaptation to  stress. thus, the protective role of athb <dig> overexpression can be regarded as a positive stress . this became even more evident upon stress treatment where seeds of transgenics showed an attenuated stress response. athb <dig> overexpression enabled the seed to respire at higher rates, which was likely related to the reduction of endogenous no levels, and helped to maintain the energy status of cells under stress. these properties might be beneficial for daily life, because seed development is prone to regular oxygen deficiency and the day/night transition causes strong fluctuations in the seeds' oxygen status  <cit> . such transient stress conditions occur daily and necessitate the adjustment of respiratory activity and metabolism. subsequently, pre-adapted transgenic seeds might have advantages under "normal" growth conditions, driving metabolism more energy-efficient, and eventually accumulating higher seed biomass.
