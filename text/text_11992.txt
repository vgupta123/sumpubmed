BACKGROUND
speciation is one of the major evolutionary drivers of the diversity of life on earth. understanding the process by which populations diversify leading, ultimately, to speciation has been one of the major focuses of evolutionary biologists for decades  <cit> . two major models of speciation have been put forward. the first model, also known as allopatric speciation, involves cessation of gene flow between two newly formed populations as a result of geographical isolation . the second model, parapatric or sympatric speciation, involves cessation of gene flow between two populations with overlapping geographical range  <cit> . many recent genetic studies, on organisms as diverse as fish  <cit> , birds  <cit> , insects  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , mammals  <cit>  and plants  <cit> , have shown that genetic exchange during population diversification is more common than was originally anticipated. hence, the reduction of gene flow between sub-populations or species, that inhabit the same geographic range, often involves a period of extrinsic reproductive isolation before acquiring an eventual intrinsic reproductive isolation.

the mechanisms by which gene flow reduces between diverging populations that overlap in their geographical range are still not very well understood. a major goal of geneticists and evolutionary biologists is to identify the mechanisms or genes and/or regions in the genome that are involved in the reduction of gene flow and eventual emergence of reproductive isolation between diverging populations. in animals, only a few genes have so far been identified to be involved in speciation, for example prdm <dig> in mouse  <cit> , and odysseus-site homeobox  <cit> , jyalpha  <cit>  and ga <dig> overdrive  <cit>  in flies. these sparse examples of identified speciation genes do not seem to suggest a common or general universal pathway/process leading to speciation but rather point to the involvement of a variety of different mechanisms in the evolution of pre- and post-zygotic barriers between different species.

speciation with gene flow could be achieved through the reduction of gene flow at specific loci in the genome, also coined islands of speciation  <cit> . multiple studies have successfully identified possible islands of speciation in the genomes of diverging species  <cit> . however, the exact contribution of these regions in speciation is still to be unraveled. furthermore, these studies have mainly focused on genetic variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms  and very few studies have investigated the role that structural variations  play in the process of population diversification  <cit> . copy number variations , a class of svs, can be a major mechanism driving gene and genome evolution by duplicating and deleting segments of the genome and as a result, create novel gene functions, disrupt gene functions, or affect regulatory mechanisms in the genome. the majority of inter-species cnv studies have focused on primates  <cit>  and suggested that species-specific copy numbers  can be evolutionarily favored because of their adaptive benefits  <cit> . however, these studies only provide insights into the role of cnvs between well-diverged species , making it difficult to determine whether these variations between species have arisen during speciation or rather accumulated during post-speciation.

the species of the genus sus provide a good model to study the effect of cnv regions  in the process of speciation. genus sus comprises of at least seven morphologically and genetically well-defined species  <cit> , that inhabit the five biodiversity hotspots in islands and mainland south east asia   <cit> . recent findings showed that these species diverged during the late pliocene , due to their isolation on different islands of isea and underwent multiple rounds of small scale inter-specific hybridization during the glacial periods of the pleistocene   <cit> . indeed, the frequent occurrence of glacial periods during the pleistocene, resulted in land bridges between isea and msea allowing migration between islands  <cit> . therefore, the process of divergence between the pigs in isea and msea, effectively follows alternating periods of allopatric  and parapatric  conditions. however, while these species can be identified based on morphology and/or dna and are still capable of producing fertile offspring  <cit> , the mechanisms that prevented these species from large scale homogenizing during the numerous glacial periods of the pleistocene remain unclear.

in this study, we analyzed the complete genome sequence of four different species of the genus sus, that are restricted to isea : sus barbatus , sus celebensis , sus cebifrons , sus verrucosus  and three populations of the species sus scrofa from europe, china and sumatra. we compared and contrasted the pattern of cnvs among population/species, in order to investigate the role that cnvrs may play in this on-going process of speciation.

RESULTS
whole genome re-sequencing data were obtained for seven populations , sus celebensis, sus verrucosus  and sus barbatus  and two individuals each from three diverged populations of sus scrofa; from sumatra, china and europe . previous analyses have shown the read depth  method to be an accurate method for computational detection of the cn of regions throughout the genome, especially with high coverage data  <cit> . since our main goal was the identification of inter-population cnvrs, the two samples from the same population were combined. the combined data was used to identify inter-population cnvrs between the seven populations by aligning short reads to the sus scrofa reference genome  <cit> . in the case of sus barbatus, all possible pairwise combinations of the four individuals displayed a high level of congruence in cn detection in both intra- and inter-population comparison . to avoid bias due to sampling size and total coverage we selected two of four sus barbatus individuals in order to give a read coverage comparable with the other populations studied . we tested the assumption that combining individuals from the same population would not create any significant bias due to the expected higher inter- than intra-population variation by comparing cn among and between the seven populations. we found that the copy number differences  between pairs of individuals from different populations were significantly higher than between individuals from the same population . thus, combining two individuals of the same population, will likely result in a higher sensitivity in calling cn with a relative minimal bias in the inter-population comparison. for each population, multi copy regions  were defined by applying a threshold of a minimum of  <dig> consecutive  <dig> kilobase  bins that have an average cn higher than  <dig> . all the mcrs were then retrieved from all populations and we then chained mcrs that were  overlapping between two or more populations. we computed the cn for all chained mcrs in each population and for each mcr, the standard deviation  of cn between the seven populations was estimated. all mcrs with a s.d. ≥ <dig>  were regarded as cnvrs  <cit> . we identified  <dig> regions, encompassing  <dig>  megabases  on the sus scrofa reference genome, as cnvrs  .table  <dig>

although cnvrs were found on every chromosome, the number and the total size of cnvrs per chromosome are not correlated with chromosome length , which is consistent with our previous study related to cnvrs in the porcine genome  <cit> . many of the identified cnvrs are relatively small, close to the effective resolution of  <dig> kb. while the size of cnvrs ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, the majority  of the cnvrs that were identified is between  <dig> and  <dig> kb . we did not observe any cnvr larger than  <dig> kb which is probably due to incompleteness and assembly errors in the current genome build resulting in gaps in the genome. in addition, the presence of repetitive elements may preclude the chaining of smaller segments of large cnvrs. repetitive sequences will break the contiguity of defined cnvrs as those regions were masked in the genome prior to the alignment. we observed a number of regions on some chromosomes having cluster of cnvrs with comparatively higher cn in some populations. for example, the  <dig>  mb region between  <dig>  mb -  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  shows higher cns in the sus scrofa populations . another example is the  <dig> kb region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  that shows a series of regions with high cn in sus-isea .figure  <dig> distribution, proportion, and frequency of cnvrs in the pig genome. a: distribution of cnvrs on the different chromosomes of the porcine genome. b: proportion of cnvrs per chromosome. c: frequency and size of cnvrs.



overall, most of the cnvrs identified displayed cn higher than two in all seven populations  with only a small fraction  being population specific. this could be due to the stringent criteria implemented to reduce false positive cnv calls. sus barbatus showed the largest number of mcrs observed as variable in cn in all the seven populations  whereas sus scrofa from sumatra showed the lowest number of mcrs observed as variable in cn in all the seven populations  .

experimental validations
we used quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction  to validate the identified cnvrs. we randomly selected ten genic cnvrs, ten non-genic cnvrs and five diploid regions and tested these using two distinct primer sets per locus. all  <dig> assays were successful and all  <dig> showed 100% agreement with our cnvrs predictions, indicating a low false discovery rate for calling cnvrs based on the rd analysis .

functional relevance of cnvrs in the genus sus
we used the porcine gene annotation of the current genome build  to identify genes encompassing cnvrs. to improve the reliability of the functional annotation of cnvrs, only genes having at least  <dig> percent overlap with a cnvr were considered. the cn of the genes were set at the cn of the overlapping cnvrs. out of the  <dig>  protein coding genes annotated in the current genome build  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were found to overlap with  <dig> cnvrs  .

the olfactory receptor gene family, one of the largest gene families in the porcine genome  <cit> , is highly over-represented with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes overlapping a cnvr . genes involved in immune response, such as ifn , ifnw <dig>  igk , il1b and pg3i, also show variation in cn between populations.

only few genes exhibit a high cn in a single population or a general high number of copies with much variation in two or more population. for example, psmb <dig> shows higher cns in sus-isea  but no sign of duplication in the three population of sus scrofa . nbpf <dig> and nbpf <dig> show high cn in all populations but with large variation in sus-isea individuals . likewise, sal <dig> shows cnv only between sus scrofa populations .

the porcine-specific immune-defense related genes npg <dig> and pmap <dig>  together with the other immune related genes usp17l <dig>  cdk <dig>  pomc, were found to be variable in cn with in general high variation in sus scrofa populations. in addition, other previously identified cnv-genes in pigs involved in metabolism  and detoxification  are found to be variable in cn in this study as well.

a gene ontology  enrichment analysis on all  <dig> genes overlapping cnvrs revealed that most of these genes are involved in biological processes regulating sensory perception of smell , signal transduction , neurological process  and metabolic process  .

cluster analysis
to investigate whether the observed cnvrs were congruent with the known phylogeny of the species, we performed a cluster analysis based on the cn at each cnv locus. the resulting tree is highly congruent to the phylogenomic analyses based on snps  <cit>  . however, some inconsistencies are observed in the resolution of branching order within sus-isea, which is not surprising as recurring hybridization was common in the evolutionary history of sus-isea  <cit> .figure  <dig> cluster and phylogenetic tree analysis. a: cluster analysis. the phylogenetic tree on the left side is obtained from frantz et al.  <cit>  and the cluster tree on the right side is obtained by cluster analysis using the actual cn of cnvrs from different populations. the branch length does not correspond to the evolutionary distance. b: nj-phylogenetic tree obtained by using the pairwise difference based on snps . c: nj-phylogenetic tree obtained by using the pairwise cnds of all possible pairs for cnvrs overlapping ors .



rate of accumulation of cnvrs 
it is generally thought that species incompatibility  and/or lack of  species recognition are more likely to be established by fast evolving genomic regions. thus a comparison between the rate of accumulation of cnv to other types of genetic variation, such as snps, could provide insight into the role of cnvs in population differentiation and speciation. to this end, a comparison between the rate of accumulation of snps and cnvs in each lineage was performed. to do so we first identified  <dig> , <dig> snps in the genomic regions that were found to be diploid  in all  <dig> individuals of  <dig> populations. we computed a rate of snp accumulation, between each pair of individuals by dividing the number of observed difference with the total sites that could be confidentially called. pairwise cnds were obtained for all possible pairs of the  <dig> individuals. the cnds were transformed into binary values with cnd ≥  <dig> as  <dig> and cnd <  <dig> as  <dig>  for each pair, the rate of pairwise difference was then calculated by dividing the total differences with the total cnvrs count . the estimated cnd rate is expected to be very conservative in comparison with the estimated rate of snps, due to our binary scale, which does not take into account the possible multiple changes in cn. for example, going from two to ten copies requires at least three duplication events but is considered as a single step in the current analysis. we observed that the rate of pairwise cnd is approximately  <dig>  times higher than the snp rate . the observed higher cnd rate compared to the snp rate could be the result of over-representation of ors in the list of genes overlapping with cnvrs. to investigate this, the rate of pairwise cnds of cnvrs overlapping with ors and without ors were calculated separately . in both comparisons, i.e. cnvrs overlapping with and without ors, the rate of pairwise cnds was observed to be higher than for snps. the elevated cnd rate therefore does not seem to be caused solely by expansion of the or gene family.

phylogenetic analysis
the observed elevated evolutionary rate of cnd may suggest that some of the cnvrs could be involved in speciation since fast evolving regions potentially play a role in the transition from pre- to postzygotic isolation. we therefore constructed neighbor joining  phylogenetic trees from snps and cnvrs pairwise distance matrices using phylip  <cit> . we repeated the analysis using cnvrs overlapping with or , cnvrs overlapping with genes other than ors  and all cnvrs . trees obtained from snps  and cnvr-or  resulted in nearly identical topologies. the snp-tree topology is identical to previous phylogenomicanalysis   <cit>  whereas the cnvr-or-tree topology deviates slightly form the snp-tree in the mixed relationship of the asian sus scrofa. by contrast, phylogenetic trees obtained from cnd of cnvr-nonor  and cnvr-all  resulted in different topologies compared to snp-based phylogenies where especially the cnvr-nonor-tree topology is highly deviating from the snp-tree. to test if population taxon sampling plays a role in the phylogenetic results, we repeated the analysis with all pairwise combinations of the four sus barbatus individuals and obtained identical phylogenetic tree topologies for all different partitions .

to further evaluate the discrepancies between the different partitions we performed a more parametric phylogenetic approach, bayesian phylogenetic analysis, using the mkv model  <cit>  as implemented in mrbayes v <dig>   <cit> , and an extending encoding of the cns. we first ran the mkv model without any topology constrains and found that the monophyly of the sus-isea and sus scrofa clades, as identified by the snp data and in previous analyses  <cit> , was highly supported  for both cnvr-or and cnvr-all, but not for cnvr-nonor which supported a sus cebifons and sus scrofa  relationship. to address the strength of support for these discrepancies we tested different constrained models that fit the history of inter-specific admixture  <cit> . we first computed the support  for a null model in which the monophyly of sus-isea and sus scrofa clades were constrained, a scenario consistent with the snp tree. thereafter  <dig> different models were tested that are described in figure  <dig> a-d. in model- <dig>  we constrained sus verrucosus and sus scrofa sumatra to be monophyletic , representing known admixture among these species  <cit> . in model- <dig>  we constrained sus celebensis and sus scrofa sumatra to be monophyletic  representing possible human translocations of sus celebensis to sumatra and neighboring islands. in model- <dig>  sus barbatus and sus scrofa sumatra were constrained to be monophyletic , representing known admixture between these two species/populations. in model- <dig>  sus cebifrons and sus scrofa china were constrained to be monophyletic , representing possible migration from msea to the philippines  <cit> . the marginal likelihood analysis strongly supports the monophyly of the two major clade of sus-isea and sus scrofa for cnvr-or and cnvr-all but not for cnvr-nonor where this monophyly provides a much poorer fit. for cnvr-nonor the difference in marginal likelihood  to the null model was  <dig>  , which strongly supports the non-monophyly of the two major clades.figure  <dig> simple schematic diagram of tested constrained models. a: constrained model  <dig> where other species consists of sus scrofa  and sus barbatus, sus cebifrons and sus celebensis. b: constrained model  <dig> where other species consists of sus scrofa  and sus barbatus, sus cebifrons and sus verrucosus. c: constrained model  <dig> where other species consists of sus scrofa  and sus cebifrons, sus celebensis and sus verrucosus. d: constrained model  <dig> where other species consists of sus scrofa  and sus barbatus, sus celebensis and sus verrucosus.

sus scrofa and sus-isea specific cnvrs
in order to identify cnvrs specific to the two monophyletic clusters, sus-isea and sus scrofa  <cit> , we ascertained cnvrs  in each of these clusters separately. we found  <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs in sus scrofa and sus-isea, respectively . a total of  <dig> cnvrs were found to overlap between the two groups  together with  <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs uniquely ascertained in sus scrofa and sus-isea group, respectively . we observed  <dig> genes in the  <dig> cnvrs whereas uniquely ascertained cnvrs in sus scrofa and sus-isea contained  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . most of the genes unique to each cluster were found to be or genes. notable, the majority of the or genes that were observed to vary in sus-isea were found to be fixed with high cn in sus scrofa populations. to test if taxon sampling introduces a bias in these group specific analyses , we re-sampled every possible combination of three in the sus-isea cluster. this sampling correction did not affect any of the results described above .

discussion
evolution of cnvrs in the genus sus and their possible role in the on-going sus speciation process
the comparison between the seven populations of genus sus  are listed as threatened species  <cit> ) allowed us to elucidate general and species-specific features of cnvs. it is known that compared to snps, cnvrs cover a larger part of the genome  and potentially have larger effects by, for example, changing gene structure, gene dosage and alternating gene regulation  <cit> . in this study, we detected  <dig> cnvrs in these five closely related species of the genus sus. the functional enrichment analysis of the cnvrs suggested that genes involved in sensory perception of smell, signal transduction, neurological process, and metabolic process are over-represented in cnvrs. the most abundant gene family in the porcine genome, the or gene family, was observed as highly over-represented in the cnvrs. this over-representation of or genes in the cnvrs could have strong functional consequences since pigs strongly rely on their sense of smell for finding food, predators, and most importantly potential mates.

the process of  speciation is thought to be triggered by a combination of many different mechanisms which include processes such as, gradual adaptation to different environment, evolution of divergent mate recognition and other molecular mechanism which are thought to be influenced by fast evolving regions in the genome. these fast evolving regions potentially accumulate divergence faster, which eventually result in creating reproductive barriers between populations. cnvrs can be a major mechanism driving gene and genome evolution by duplication and deletion of segments of the genome and as a result, create novel gene functions, disrupt gene functions, or affect regulatory mechanisms in the genome. the comparison between the rate of accumulation of cnvrs and the rate of accumulation of snps suggests that the cnvrs are evolving approximately  <dig>  fold faster than snps, which is in line with a recent study in apes  <cit>  where a  <dig>  fold differences was observed between cnvrs and snps. thus, these fast evolving cnvrs, especially those overlapping with functional regions in the genome might be a major driver of the on-going speciation in pigs.

the recent study on speciation of the genus sus has shown that these taxa have undergone multiple rounds of small-scale inter-specific hybridization  during the glacial periods of the pleistocene   <cit> . despite the multiple events of interspecific hybridization and being geographically very close to sus-isea populations, the sumatran sus scrofa population  was found to be less admixed with sus-isea than sus scrofa. this implies the existence of mechanisms that prevented these species from massive homogenizing during the numerous glacial periods of the pleistocene. furthermore, the phylogenetic tree analysis based on pairwise cnd of cnvr-or and pairwise difference in snps suggests that cnvr-or largely recapitulates the accepted phylogeny of the genus sus  <cit> , whereas the phylogenetic trees obtained by using pairwise cnd of cnvr-nonor, show inconsistencies with the phylogenetic history of the genus sus and instead follows expected patterns of random drift and/or admixture  <cit>  . the strength of support for these inconsistencies were assessed by testing the support of different constrained models that fit the history of inter-specific admixture reported in a previous study  <cit>  using a novel bayesian phylogenetic analysis approach. the bayesian phylogenetic analysis on the cn partitions significantly supported the recapitulations of topology of the genus sus by cnvr-or whereas for cnvr-nonor the inconsistent topology representing admixture/random drift of genus sus was strongly supported. thus, cnvrs with or show resistance to admixture and random drift effects between the analyzed species. this observation in combination with the observed higher rate of evolution suggests that these or genes could play a major role in the on-going speciation process of sus, facilitating rapid adaptation to different environments and divergence in mate recognition. furthermore, pigs are known to depend highly on their sense of smell for foraging and mate recognition, and have one of the largest functional or repertoires observed in mammals, which additionally makes it plausible that ors are important in speciation of pigs.

besides or genes, genes involved in immune response, defense to pathogens and detoxification such as interferons , npg <dig>  pmap <dig> and cytochrome p <dig> , are usually also fast evolving due to their importance for the organism to respond rapidly to changes in the environment and food-borne pathogens  <cit> . thus, together with ors, the observed variation in cn of these genes suggests an ongoing process of evolution of these gene families and their importance for adaptation in a rapidly changing environment.

despite the similar divergence time  <cit> , the total cnvrs in the sus-isea group  was found to be higher than that in sus scrofa . in addition, for the  <dig> sus-isea specific cnvrs, sus scrofa shows universal high and fixed cn between three diverse sus scrofa populations and most of the genes overlapping with group specific cnvrs are found to be ors . this fixation might have happened soon after the split of the ancestral sus scrofa population from the other sus species from isea around  <dig> mya.

we suggest that cnvr-ors, might have provided the means to rapid adaption to different environments during the diversification of the genus in the pliocene  <cit> . further, the cnvr-ors might have acted as barriers against gene flow during the multiple round of hybridization that took place later in the pleistocene. to what extent these regions might have played a role in differentiating of sus scrofa from the rest of the suids is another interesting topic which requires a more extensive taxon sampling of highly diverged suids from other parts of the world.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> cnvrs across the genus sus. these cnvrs encompass  <dig> genes and were found to evolve ~ <dig>  times faster than snps. the majority of these copy number variable genes are ors known to play a prominent role in food foraging and mate recognition in sus. phylogenetic analyses, including novel bayesian analysis, based on cnvrs that overlap ors retain the well-accepted topology of the genus sus whereas cnvrs overlapping genes other than ors show evidence for random drift and/or admixture. we hypothesize that inter-specific variation in copy number of ors provided the means for rapid adaptation to different environments during the diversification of the genus sus in the pliocene. furthermore, these regions might have acted as barriers preventing massive gene flow between these species during the multiple hybridization events that took place later in the pleistocene suggesting a possible prominent role of ors in the ongoing sus speciation.
