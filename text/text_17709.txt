BACKGROUND
virus-like particles  are structurally identical to native viruses, but they lack the viral genetic material  <cit> . vlp are obtained when the major viral structural proteins are simultaneously expressed in a recombinant system. there exists an increasing interest on vlp production due to their promising applications as vaccines, as delivery vehicles for substances or genes, or as biosensors  <cit> . a recent example of the importance of vlp is the recent approval of merck's vaccine against human papilloma virus. the production of vlp is a complex process and a challenging task, as it requires the simultaneous expression of various recombinant proteins. due to its versatility and simplicity for coexpressing various recombinant genes, the insect-cell baculovirus expression vector system  has been commonly employed for producing vlp of several viruses.

the simultaneous production of several proteins in insect cells requires the delivery of various genes, either by a number of individual baculoviruses or by employing a single virus that contains several genes  <cit> . of these strategies, the use of individual baculoviruses allows the manipulation of the concentration of each protein by changing the multiplicity of infection  of each virus  <cit> . in this way, the stoichiometry between the structural proteins may be controlled. in some vlp, which can have variable protein composition, changes in the ratio between structural proteins result in different vlp compositions, which can yield particles with different immunogenicity  <cit> . it is also possible that different stoichiometries between the structural proteins result in changes in vlp assembly efficiencies or kinetics, although this remains to be studied. therefore, moi manipulation is a powerful tool for finding the conditions required for maximizing the assembly of a desired vlp. however, little is known about the performance of simultaneous infections with various recombinant baculoviruses, specifically regarding cell population kinetics and possible interferences or synergies between the coinfecting viruses.

rotavirus is a triple-layered virus that is responsible of gastroenteritis. the inner layer, a core-like particle, is constituted by vp <dig>  surrounded by a second concentric layer containing vp <dig>  the third layer is formed by vp <dig> and spikes of vp <dig>  <cit> . recently, mena et al.  <cit>  studied the accumulation in insect cells of double layered rotavirus-like particles , that are constituted by the two inner concentric layers. they found that the assembly of dlrlp occurs intracellularly, and that, when expressed individually, both vp <dig> and vp <dig> form structures that cannot further assemble into double-layered particles. namely, under such condition vp <dig> forms tubes whereas vp <dig> forms core-like particles densely packed in ordered groups. neither tubes nor densely packed cores are accessible for interaction with the other recombinant protein, and thus dlrlp cannot be formed. these findings underline the importance of having both vp <dig> and vp <dig> available for assembly into dlrlp in each cell of the culture and at the right time to avoid the formation of structures composed only by a single protein. a similar situation occurs when other vlp are produced, such as adeno-associated viral vectors, which require the simultaneous expression of the structural and non-structural proteins, as well as replication of vector dna in the same cell  <cit> . it can be anticipated that appropriate infection strategies, based on the manipulation of moi, would maximize vlp yield. several groups have studied the dynamics of infection at various moi, while others have predicted by mathematical modeling the percentage of the population infected under different conditions  <cit> . nonetheless, cell population kinetics during the simultaneous infection with two recombinant viruses have, to our knowledge, not been studied

a powerful tool for assessing the dynamics of infection at different moi is flow cytometry. this methodology has been used to determine the percentage of the population infected at different moi by a single type of virus  <cit> , for assessing the productivity of different cell lines  <cit> , to measure respiratory activity  <cit> , to titer viruses  <cit> , and to determine transducing titers of gene delivery vectors  <cit> . flow cytometry has also been used to screen bf <dig> fish cells simultaneously infected with non-recombinant viruses of two different species; the pancreatic necrosis virus and the hematopoietic necrosis virus  <cit> . in our work, insect cells were infected with one or two different recombinant baculoviruses, expressing rotavirus vp <dig> or vp <dig>  at different moi. utilizing flow cytometry we have, for the first time, determined the kinetics of cell populations expressing either of the recombinant proteins during simultaneous infections with both recombinant baculoviruses and compared them with single infections. moreover, we have determined the infection conditions required to guarantee that the highest fraction of the population is simultaneously expressing both recombinant proteins, one of the necessary conditions for complete and efficient dlrlp production.

RESULTS
cultures infected with a single baculovirus
insect cell cultures individually infected with bacgfpvp <dig> or vp <dig> were analyzed by flow cytometry at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection . moi of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pfu/cell were tested. fluorescence histograms at  <dig> hpi are shown in figure  <dig>  along with an uninfected control culture performed simultaneously. when analyzing these results, it should be taken into account that fluorescence emission was measured at two different wavelengths,  <dig> for gfpvp <dig> and  <dig> nm for immunolabeled gp <dig> and vp <dig>  thus, background fluorescence of uninfected cells was different. cells expressing a recombinant protein could be easily distinguished from uninfected cells. the distribution of the populations expressing gfpvp <dig> was different from the one expressing vp <dig>  data extracted from fluorescence histograms of duplicate cultures are summarized in figure 2a, where the fraction of the population expressing a recombinant protein is reported relative to the total cell count . it should be considered that the analysis shown in figure  <dig> allows the identification of the population expressing a recombinant protein , but not necessarily that of infected cells, as expression of the recombinant gene might be absent or inefficient even in infected cells. a marker that has been used to monitor infection by baculovirus is gp <dig>  <cit> . gp <dig> is the major envelope glycoprotein of baculovirus  <cit> , and accumulates in the membrane of infected cells during the first  <dig> to  <dig> hpi  <cit> . to correlate infection with recombinant protein expression, gp <dig> was immunodetected at  <dig> hpi in cultures expressing gfpvp <dig> . in addition, the population distribution predicted by poisson:

commonly used to describe infection, is also plotted in figure 2a <cit> . the population fraction expressing any of the recombinant proteins or gp <dig> increased in a hyperbolic-type function with moi up to  <dig> pfu/cell, and then remained constant for moi above  <dig> pfu/cell. such a behavior is in agreement with predictions based on the poisson distribution. cultures infected with bacvp <dig> or bacgfpvp <dig> had a similar trend, which was also similar to the population expressing gp <dig> in the cultures infected with bacgfpvp <dig>  the similar behavior between cells expressing gfpvp <dig>  gp <dig> and vp <dig> confirms that the results obtained from cells immunostained for vp <dig> were representative of the population expressing that recombinant protein, and that both recombinant baculoviruses were equally infective. results obtained at  <dig> hpi are shown in figure 2b. the poisson distribution is not plotted in figure 2b, as secondary infection had occurred at this time, and different calculations are needed to predict the infected population under these conditions . at 48hpi, between  <dig> to 90% of the cells were expressing either recombinant protein, regardless of the moi. however, at moi below  <dig> pfu/cell, a smaller population of cells expressed gfpvp <dig>  in comparison with that expressing vp <dig> 

handling of cultures expressing gfpvp <dig> for facs analysis was easier than those for vp <dig>  as vp <dig> had to be immunostained by a laborious procedure, whereas intrinsic fluorescence of gfpvp <dig> facilitated the assay. therefore the population containing this recombinant protein was followed every  <dig> h until  <dig> hpi. results are shown in figure 3a. the population expressing gfpvp <dig> reached a maximum at  <dig> hpi for cultures infected at a moi of  <dig> pfu/cell or higher. in contrast, such population reached a maximum until  <dig> hpi for cultures infected at moi of less than  <dig> pfu/cell. in all cases, the percentage of the population expressing a recombinant protein decreased after  <dig> hpi , probably due to degradation of the recombinant protein after loss of cell membrane integrity in non-viable cells. viability decreased steadily after infection, reaching 0% at  <dig> hpi in cultures infected at moi of  <dig> and  <dig> pfu/cell. the rate of decrease of the viability was lower as the moi decreased.

cultures simultaneously infected with bacgfpvp <dig> and bacvp6
gating parameters used for discriminating between cells expressing gfpvp <dig>  vp <dig> or both proteins were set according to fluorescence  at  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm  in uninfected cultures, cultures expressing only gfpvp <dig>  or cultures expressing vp <dig>  typical results are shown in figures 4a–c. as expected, uninfected cultures had a low emission both at  <dig> or  <dig> nm , whereas cells infected with bacgfpvp <dig> had a high emission at  <dig> nm . moreover, cells infected with bacvp <dig> had a high fluorescence at  <dig> nm . accordingly, gating parameters, which allowed the differentiation between the three populations present in coinfected cultures, could be set. flow cytometry results of a culture simultaneously infected with bacgfpvp <dig> and vp <dig> at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi are shown in figure 4d and 4e, respectively. at  <dig> hpi many cells could be clearly classified as expressing vp <dig>  whereas only relatively few cells were expressing both recombinant proteins. at  <dig> hpi, only a few cells were not expressing a recombinant protein, while most were either expressing vp <dig> or both recombinant proteins simultaneously. a small fraction of the population was expressing only gfpvp <dig>  a quantitative analysis of the flow cytometry study is presented below.

the results obtained from  <dig> experimental setups performed in duplicate are summarized in figure  <dig>  cultures were infected at different moi combinations of bacgfpvp <dig> and bacvp <dig>  moi of each virus were not increased above  <dig> pfu/cell, as higher moi did not result in a higher population fraction expressing any of the recombinant proteins in single infections . in most cases, the largest fraction of the population expressed vp <dig>  regardless of the moi of bacgfpvp <dig>  the only exceptions were the cultures infected with  <dig>  and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacvp <dig> and bacgfpvp <dig>  respectively, either at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi. in these cultures, the population expressing either of the recombinant proteins was about the same. it should be noted that, in the extreme situation, the population fraction expressing vp <dig> was  <dig>  times larger than that expressing gfpvp <dig> . the highest percentage of the population expressing any recombinant protein  at  <dig> hpi was obtained at moi of  <dig> pfu/cell for both bacgfpvp <dig> and bacvp <dig>  i.e. a total moi of  <dig> pfu/cell. such population fraction was 15% higher than that expressing any recombinant protein at the highest total moi tested, which corresponded to  <dig> pfu/cell . the population fraction expressing both recombinant proteins at  <dig> hpi closely followed the population expressing gfpvp <dig> 

coinfections had various effects on the population expressing gfpvp <dig>  in general, the cell population expressing gfpvp <dig> in coinfected cultures was smaller than in single-infected cultures at the same moi, except in two cases at  <dig> hpi . namely, in cultures infected at a moi of  <dig>  pfu/cell of each baculovirus, the population expressing gfpvp <dig> was duplicated, in comparison to that observed in single infections. moreover, at  <dig>  pfu/cell of bacvp <dig> and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacgfpvp <dig>  the population expressing gfpvp <dig> was the same than that observed in single infections. in contrast, the population expressing vp <dig> at  <dig> hpi increased in coinfections, compared to individual infections. in cultures infected at moi of  <dig>  pfu/cell of bacvp <dig>   <dig> % of the population expressed vp <dig> in single-infected cultures, whereas in coinfections up to 45% of the population expressed vp <dig> . something similar occurred at a moi of bacvp <dig> of 1pfu/cell, as 65% of the population expressed vp <dig> in single-infected cultures, while in coinfections such percentage increased to  <dig> – 85% at  <dig> hpi.

compared to  <dig> hpi, the population expressing any of the recombinant protein increased at  <dig> hpi . this increase occurred even in cultures infected with a moi of bacgfpvp <dig> of  <dig> pfu/cell; a behavior not observed in individual infections. the population fraction expressing vp <dig> at  <dig> hpi reached 98%  in cultures infected at moi of  <dig>  or  <dig> pfu/cell of any of the baculoviruses. in most cases the percentage of the population expressing gfpvp <dig> at  <dig> hpi was smaller than that expressing vp <dig>  with the exception of the cultures infected with  <dig>  pfu/cell of bacvp <dig> and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacgfpvp <dig>  where the population expressing either protein was equal. the condition that resulted in the highest percentage of the population simultaneously expressing both recombinant proteins was a moi of bacgfpvp <dig> of  <dig> pfu/cell and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacvp <dig>  such condition resulted in 48% and 58% of the population at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively, simultaneously expressing both recombinant proteins. populations expressing the recombinant proteins were not followed after  <dig> hpi as further infections by progeny viruses were not expected after  <dig> hpi, and a rapid decline in viability was observed after this time .

to better appreciate the effect of coinfections, the population expressing any of the recombinant proteins  at  <dig> hpi is shown in figure  <dig> as a function of total moi . for comparison, the poisson distribution is also plotted. it can be seen that coinfected cultures with a moi of bacvp <dig> equal or higher than that of bacgfpvp <dig> followed the poisson distribution. however, cultures where the moi of bacgfpvp <dig> was  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> times higher than that of bacvp <dig> had a much lower population expressing any of the recombinant proteins than that predicted by the poisson distribution at the corresponding cumulative moi.

discussion
previous reports  <cit>  and this work demonstrate the utility of flow cytometry for monitoring recombinant protein expression. in this work, a wider screening of recombinant protein expression at different moi and at different times postinfection was performed, in addition to following the populations expressing two recombinant proteins during coinfections. at  <dig> hpi, the percentage of the population expressing vp <dig> and gp <dig> closely followed the poisson distribution. this observation is relevant, as it has been shown that various culture variables, including medium composition, mode of culture, temperature, etc., can affect infection  <cit> . the percentage of the population expressing a recombinant protein did not reach 100%, most probably due to the viability of cultures at the time of infection, which was between  <dig> and 98%. it should be noted that the population expressing gfpvp <dig> at  <dig> hpi with a moi below  <dig> pfu/cell was in most cases lower than that expressing gp <dig>  or vp <dig>  it is possible that the smaller population expressing gfpvp <dig> was a result of the slower production rate of this protein in comparison with vp <dig>  as has been observed previously  <cit> . thus, in some cells the amount of gfpvp <dig> at  <dig> hpi may be below the detection limit of the flow cytometer. it should be taken into account that, according to the life cycle of baculovirus, production of gfpvp <dig> would start around  <dig> hpi, as its gene is under the very late polh promoter  <cit> . in contrast, the population expressing gp <dig>  which is expressed in the early and late phases of infection , behaved as vp <dig>  which is also under the polh promoter but has a higher production rate than gfpvp <dig>  <cit> . thus, the observed difference cannot be attributed to a difference in infectivity between the two recombinant viruses.

measurements performed at  <dig> hpi reflect primary infection. at  <dig> hpi, the population of cells expressing a recombinant protein increased in cultures infected at moi below  <dig> pfu/cell. such an increase was a result of infection by the viral progeny produced during the late phase of the primary infection . at  <dig> hpi, secondary infection resulted in a similar population of cells expressing vp <dig> regardless of differences in the moi . in contrast, the population expressing gfpvp <dig> at moi below  <dig> pfu/cell did not catch up at  <dig> hpi with that at the higher moi of  <dig> or  <dig> pfu/cell. such a lower percentage of population expressing gfpvp <dig> at  <dig> hpi may be a result of the rapid decline in viability observed in these cultures , which did not occur in cultures expressing vp <dig> . wu et al.  <cit>  also observed that infection with baculoviruses containing different recombinant genes results in different cell death kinetics. the decrease in viability was faster as the moi increased, similarly to what wu et al.  <cit>  observed in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> pfu/cell.

in general, population fractions obtained from individually infected cultures cannot be extrapolated to coinfections, a phenomenon that has not been previously described in coinfections with two different recombinant viruses of the same species. the increase of the population expressing vp <dig> in coinfected cultures may be a result of a cooperative action between both baculoviruses. cultures infected at low moi of bacvp <dig> would result in only a fraction of the population infected with this virus. progeny virus would begin to bud from  <dig> hpi  <cit>  and infect cells still susceptible to additional infection. it has been shown that virus binding to infected cells can occur up to  <dig> hpi  <cit> . therefore, cells initially infected with bacgfpvp <dig> were still susceptible to additional infection by bacvp <dig>  but, in contrast to single infections at low moi, all the viral proteins and transcription factors of the very late phase of infection would be already present when the vp <dig> gene reached the cell nucleus. this may occur as early as  <dig> hour after progeny virus budding  <cit> . accordingly, transcription of the vp <dig> gene could start, during secondary infection, as early as  <dig> h after the initial infection by bacgfpvp <dig>  this would explain the higher population expressing vp <dig> in coinfections in comparison to individual infections. according to this hypothesis, the difference between the populations expressing vp <dig> in coinfections or in single infections roughly corresponded to the fraction of cells simultaneously expressing both recombinant proteins. a different situation was observed in the case of the population expressing gfpvp <dig>  at moi of  <dig> pfu/cell, the population expressing gfpvp <dig> decreased around 30% in coinfections compared to single infections. in general, coinfections at high moi of gfpvp <dig> resulted in a lower population expressing a recombinant protein. it appears that secondary infection of bacvp <dig> interferes with the expression of gfpvp <dig> by a mechanism still unknown. a similar phenomenon was observed by alonso et al.  <cit> , in, to our knowledge, the only other work characterizing coinfections with flow cytometry, although using non-recombinant viruses. in such work, coinfections with hematopoietic necrosis virus and hepatic necrosis virus were screened in a fish cell line. the hepatic necrosis virus interfered with growth of the hematopoietic necrosis virus. however, care should be taken when comparing our work with that of alonso et al.  <cit> , as they worked with two different virus species. following mrna kinetics may help elucidate the interference mechanism of bacvp <dig> with the expression of gfpvp <dig>  vieira et al.  <cit>  followed the kinetics of baculovirus replication and found that the number of copies of baculovirus dna coding for vp <dig> was about half of that coding for vp <dig> in coinfected cultures, which could explain a less efficient secondary infection by bacgfpvp <dig>  they also found that no difference exists between the mrna stability of vp <dig> or vp <dig> expressed in the insect-cell baculovirus system. it remains to be determined if the same situation occurs in the case of the fusion gene gfpvp <dig> 

we have previously compared the production of vp <dig> and vp <dig> upon infection or coinfection of sf <dig> cells  <cit> . we found that the production rates of vp <dig> and vp <dig> were similar in individual infections or coinfections at an moi of  <dig> pfu/cell. in this work, we did not follow the recombinant protein production rates. however, we did observe that in the culture coinfected with  <dig> pfu/cell of bacgfpvp <dig> and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacvp <dig> , the population fraction expressing each of the recombinant proteins was similar to that observed in individually infected cultures. it can be inferred that such cultures would also have a similar recombinant protein production rate, as the cultures we have coinfected in the past at a moi of  <dig> pfu.cell.

for efficient production of rotavirus like-particles, adequate vlp assembly would require the simultaneous expression of both gfpvp <dig> and vp <dig> by the largest population of cells  <cit> . such situation was encountered at a moi of  <dig> pfu/cell of bacgfpvp <dig> and  <dig> pfu/cell of bacvp <dig>  with 58% of the population expressing both recombinant proteins at  <dig> hpi. it was observed that the population simultaneously expressing both recombinant proteins closely followed the population expressing gfpvp <dig>  indicating that expression of bacgfpvp <dig> was the limiting step. we are now working on kinetic studies of the production of single- or double shelled rotavirus-like particles upon infection with bacgfpvp <dig> and bacvp <dig> 

the characteristics of a recombinant protein and expression system directly affect the production kinetics and determine the limiting steps during its biosynthesis. for instance, molecular weight, posttranslational modifications, the site of accumulation, and other characteristics can affect protein yields. accordingly, the results presented here can serve as a general practical guideline but inherent characteristics of each particular case must be considered.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have, for the first time determined the effect of the simultaneous infection with two recombinant baculovirus on the populations expressing two recombinant proteins. the kinetics of cell populations expressing both recombinant proteins in coinfections could not have been predicted from single infection data or from the poisson distribution based on theoretical considerations. it was observed that secondary infection of bacvp <dig> interfered with bacgfp <dig> expression, and also resulted in a higher percentage of the population expressing vp <dig>  the moi for each virus that resulted in the highest population percentage expressing both recombinant proteins was found. the information generated in this work describes a novel phenomenon and is useful for designing rational infection strategies needed in several applications for improving the simultaneous expression of two recombinant proteins in systems based on viral gene delivery. future work in coinfections with several recombinant baculoviruses for producing various proteins by insect cells should take into account that the population behavior of individual infections may be different to that in single infections.
