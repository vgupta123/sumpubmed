BACKGROUND
genes at the major histocompatibility complex  are known for their high levels of polymorphism  <cit> , and for their importance in initiating the adaptive vertebrate immune response by binding to foreign peptides and presenting them to t cells  <cit> . class i mhc molecules primarily bind to peptides derived from intracellular pathogens, while class ii molecules are associated with extracellular pathogens. mhc variability is maintained through balancing selection, with parasite-mediated natural selection and mhc-dependent sexual selection being the most likely mechanisms  <cit> . a number of lines of evidence indicate that mhc genes are under selection  <cit> , including an excess of nonsynonymous mutations at the peptide-binding region  <cit>  and the long-term retention of allelic lineages post-speciation . discrepancies between population genetic structure at selectively neutral and mhc loci also provide evidence of selection  <cit> , because both neutral and mhc loci are affected by neutral forces , but only mhc loci should also be affected by selection.

many natural populations studied have the high variability expected at mhc loci  <cit> . while population bottlenecks are predicted to result in a loss of variability, balancing selection may counteract the effects of drift unless the effective population size becomes so low relative to the selection coefficient that genes under balancing selection behave in a neutral manner  <cit> . a few studies have found relatively high variability at mhc genes in bottlenecked species with low neutral variability  <cit> . however, most studies of small island  <cit>  and mainland  <cit>  populations that have undergone severe bottlenecks have documented reduced mhc diversity and concluded that genetic drift had overwhelmed selection .

in this study, we investigated mhc and neutral genetic variation in an island species, the galápagos hawk , and its closest mainland relative, the swainson's hawk . galápagos hawks are endemic to the galápagos archipelago and breed on eight islands but were historically distributed on these and three additional islands . no systematic estimate of current population size exists for galápagos hawks; however, our rough estimates are that two populations consist of several hundred individuals each, while the other six almost certainly are fewer than  <dig> individuals each.

previous genetic work revealed low within-population variability and significant between-population differentiation at minisatellite and mitochondrial loci  <cit> , indicating little to no current gene flow among islands. in contrast, the migratory swainson's hawk , whose population size is unknown but likely numbers at least in the hundreds of thousands based on counts of migrants  <cit> , shows limited population genetic structuring across its western north american breeding range  <cit> . with their broader distribution and larger population sizes, swainson's hawks are more variable than galápagos hawks at minisatellite  <cit>  and mitochondrial loci  <cit> . mitochondrial data suggest that these two species diverged recently relative to other avian taxa, approximately  <dig>  years ago . hull et al.  <cit>  documented mitochondrial paraphyly of the swainson's hawk relative to the galápagos hawk, likely a result of incomplete lineage sorting subsequent to colonization.

here we present the first characterization of mhc class ii b genes in galápagos and swainson's hawks with the goal of comparing mhc variability in these two species. we predicted that variability would be lower in the galápagos hawk due to a genetic bottleneck at foundation followed by ongoing genetic drift in these small populations. to better assess the role of genetic drift, we genotyped galápagos hawks at nuclear microsatellite loci to compare neutral diversity with swainson's hawks . finally, we provide a preliminary assessment of mhc evolution in these two closely related species by characterizing the gene copies amplified.

RESULTS
mhc diversity
sequencing of exon  <dig> from mhc class ii b genes revealed that galápagos hawks had lower mhc diversity than swainson's hawks. we recovered three different mhc sequences from  <dig> galápagos hawks and  <dig> sequences from the  <dig> swainson's hawks sampled. each sequence yielded a different amino acid sequence, and no frameshift mutations or stop codons were present . each galápagos hawk individual had two or three sequences. one sequence, buga* <dig>  was present in all individuals. all individuals also had one or both of buga* <dig> and buga*03: twelve individuals had only buga* <dig>  fifteen had only buga* <dig>  and five had both. the most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that the primer set amplified two loci: a locus that is fixed for buga* <dig> and a locus that has two alleles, with individuals being homozygous or heterozygous for buga* <dig> and buga* <dig>  buga* <dig> and buga* <dig> differed by only one base pair; in contrast, buga* <dig> and buga* <dig> differed from buga* <dig> by  <dig> and  <dig> bases, respectively, out of  <dig> bp, and had a one codon deletion not present in buga* <dig> . we sampled only four birds per island, so our characterization of the geographic distribution of buga* <dig> and buga* <dig> is preliminary; however, each was present on at least six of the eight islands: santa fe, pinta, santiago, and fernandina had both sequences; pinzón and marchena had only buga*02; and española and isabela had only buga* <dig>  buga* <dig> was present on all islands.

from the swainson's hawks, we recovered  <dig> different sequences, with each individual having three or four confirmed sequences. fifth sequences were recovered from three of the individuals; however, we were unable to confirm these because in each case the fifth sequence amplified in only one reaction or did not sequence cleanly. so, every individual had at least two loci. in the  <dig> birds sampled, we found  <dig> different mhc genotypes . the most common sequence  was recovered from  <dig> different birds, while  <dig> of the sequences were recovered from one or two birds. four of the  <dig> sequences had a  <dig> bp deletion at the same codon as the two galápagos hawk sequences. of the  <dig> sites considered,  <dig> were variable , and sequences differed by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp.

phylogenetic relationships of class ii b sequences
a phylogenetic network revealed structuring among galápagos and swainson's hawk sequences . galápagos and swainson's hawk sequences were more similar to other sequences from falconiformes than to those from other orders. nine swainson's hawk sequences and the fixed galápagos hawk sequence  formed a cluster designated group  <dig>  ten swainson's and the two remaining galápagos hawk sequences formed a second group , and one swainson's sequence  was divergent from the rest, being more similar to sequences from other species. all six sequences with the codon deletion were in group  <dig>  one common buzzard  sequence  also fell into group  <dig>  while the second buzzard sequence  had characteristics of both groups; the first two-thirds of the sequence closely matched group  <dig>  while the remainder matched group  <dig> . sequences within group  <dig> were less divergent than those within group  <dig> . the two groups had similar numbers of sequences ; however, sequences in group  <dig> had  <dig> variable sites and differed by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases, whereas sequences in group  <dig> had only  <dig> variable sites and differed by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases. group  <dig> and group  <dig> sequences differed by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases. busw* <dig>  present in only one individual, was more divergent than the other sequences. it differed from group  <dig> sequences by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases out of  <dig> and from group  <dig> by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases. galápagos and swainson's hawks did not share any sequences, and within-group diversity was lower in the galápagos hawk than in the swainson's hawk .

the sample size of individuals sequenced , number of different sequences recovered, number of polymorphic sites, and nucleotide diversity  are given. the statistics are based on  <dig> bp of exon  <dig> 

positive selection on exon 2
we found evidence for positive selection on putative peptide-binding codons , with results being very similar for pbcs identified by brown et al.  <cit>  and tong et al.  <cit>  . analyzing all of the sequences together, rates of nonsynonymous substitutions were significantly greater than synonymous substitutions at pbcs but not at the remaining codons. the same was true when swainson's hawks were analyzed separately; we did not analyze galápagos hawks separately due to the paucity of sequences. substitution rates were higher in group  <dig> than group 1;  <dig> % of pbcs  were polymorphic in group  <dig> and only  <dig> % in group  <dig>  we also found evidence of positive selection using the maximum likelihood method implemented in codeml. both selection models  provided a better fit than their respective neutral models  for all three sequence sets tested . the m <dig> models identified a total of eight sites as being under positive selection with posterior probabilities > <dig>  . the sites varied between group  <dig> and  <dig> sequences: two were significant in group  <dig> only, three in group  <dig> only, and three in both. of the eight sites identified by codeml as being under positive selection, six were designated by brown et al.  <cit>  and seven by tong et al.  <cit>  as being peptide-binding .

separate analyses were run using all sequences, buteo swainsoni sequences, group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  codons were designated as peptide-binding or non-peptide-binding using two methods: brown et al.  <cit>  and tong et al.  <cit> . significance levels of z-tests for positive selection  are indicated by asterisks .

separate analyses were performed on all sequences , group  <dig> , and group  <dig> . log-likelihood values and parameter estimates calculated by codeml are presented, as are the sites predicted by models m2a and m <dig> to be under positive selection with posterior probabilities > <dig>  and likelihood ratio test  statistics. lrts were used to compare m2a to m1a and m <dig> to m <dig>  the test statistics were compared to a chi-square distribution with df =  <dig>  the positively selected sites are numbered according to the alignment in figure  <dig> 

neutral variability
galápagos hawks have low diversity at microsatellite loci as well. we found a total of  <dig> alleles across  <dig> loci in the  <dig> individuals genotyped. for the seven populations, mean allelic richness varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> . this low variability does not appear to be the result of a recent bottleneck. the program bottleneck reported a significant excess of heterozygosity in only one  of the seven populations; however, sample sizes may have been too small to provide statistical resolution.

microsatellite variation was lower in galápagos hawks than in swainson's hawks. for a more direct comparison, we pooled the galápagos hawk populations and re-evaluated them using only the  <dig> loci that had also been used to genotype swainson's hawks  <cit> : bswa110w, bswa204w, bswa302w, bswa317w, bswb220w, bswd107w, bswd122w, bswd127w, bswd210w, bswd220w, bswd310w, bswd313w, and bswd324w. galápagos hawks had significantly lower mean allelic richness, expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity than swainson's hawks .

allelic richness , gene diversity, and observed heterozygosity  are given. for the galápagos hawk, we present measures from each population individually using all  <dig> polymorphic loci, and then we present measures for all populations combined at the  <dig> loci that were also used to genotype swainson's hawks  <cit> .

discussion
while mhc peptide-binding genes typically display high variability, in some cases small or bottlenecked populations are reported to exhibit reduced variation. we had predicted that mhc class ii b variability would be lower in the endemic galápagos hawk than in the mainland swainson's hawk due to a colonization event followed by ongoing genetic drift in the small island populations. we found that galápagos hawks had fewer, less divergent sequences than swainson's hawks. a corresponding low level of neutral microsatellite variability suggests that drift has played a strong role in shaping mhc variation in galápagos hawks.

low genetic diversity in the galápagos hawk
galápagos hawks exhibited low mhc class ii b diversity, with all  <dig> individuals having buga* <dig>  and one or both of buga* <dig> and buga* <dig> . fixed loci have been reported in other species, including an island rat  <cit>  and bottlenecked populations of the eurasian beaver  <cit> ; however, in those cases populations were fixed for different alleles. likewise, other island populations have fewer mhc alleles compared to a mainland relative  <cit> . the reduced set of alleles found in the island populations of eurasian kestrel  <cit>  and seychelles warbler  <cit>  were just as divergent as alleles present in mainland populations. in contrast, buga* <dig> and buga* <dig> differ by only one base. exon  <dig> alleles typically differ by a larger number of bases; for example, lesser kestrel sequences differ by an average of  <dig>  bases  <cit> . so, it is more likely that one of these galápagos hawk alleles arose from the other through point mutation, than both being retained ancestral alleles. similarly, the endangered galápagos penguin has only three sequences  at one locus, suggesting the penguins were once fixed for a single allele also  <cit> . interestingly, none of the galápagos sequences was present among the swainson's hawks sampled, which could be because those sequences were rare in the ancestral population or they mutated from ancestral sequences after colonization.

the low genetic diversity present at neutral markers provides strong evidence for the role of a founder event and ongoing genetic drift within the galápagos hawk. allelic richness and heterozygosity at microsatellite loci were lower in galápagos populations than in the swainson's hawk population. a similar pattern of low diversity occurs at minisatellite loci; individuals within populations share an average of 69-96% of their minisatellite alleles  <cit> , while an average of 20-30% is more typical for outbred populations  <cit> . at the mitochondrial control region, galápagos hawks had five haplotypes that were on average less divergent than the  <dig> haplotypes in swainson's hawks  <cit> , and seven of eight populations appear fixed for single haplotypes at almost  <dig> kb of mitochondrial sequence  <cit> .

the pattern of mhc variation in the galápagos hawk is likely the result of a loss of ancestral variability at the time of colonization. the apparent fixation of buga* <dig> and possible past fixation of buga*02/ <dig> is more consistent with an extreme bottleneck than ongoing drift. also, buga* <dig> is present on all eight islands; the other two sequences are each present on at least six islands, with at least four populations having both. minisatellite and mitochondrial data indicate little current gene flow among populations  <cit> , so the geographic distribution of the sequences suggests that mhc variability was reduced at or soon after foundation and that the hawks carried the reduced set of alleles with them as they colonized the various islands. minisatellite data also hint at an early reduction in genetic variability because of high background similarity across all populations  <cit> , and four of the populations  are fixed for the same mitochondrial haplotype  <cit> .

in addition to drift, low mhc variability in the galápagos hawk could be attributed to relaxed selection or purifying selection. parasite diversity on islands may be lower than on the mainland  <cit> , so island populations may experience reduced selection pressure, resulting in less mhc variation being maintained  <cit> . island kestrels that experienced lower pathogen diversity and prevalence than mainland kestrels also had lower mhc variability  <cit> . galápagos hawks harbour five ectoparasite species and an undescribed trypanosoma species  <cit> , but swainson's hawks are likely exposed to a greater diversity of both endo- and ectoparasites. for example, swainson's hawks carry five louse species  <cit> , while galápagos hawks carry three. swainson's hawks are migratory and should encounter different sets of pathogens at their breeding and wintering grounds, which has been hypothesized to lead to greater selection for variability at the mhc  <cit> . alternatively, the lack of mhc variation could be explained by purifying selection for alleles advantageous against a current parasite or a past selective sweep  <cit> . these alternatives do not explain the corresponding low variability at neutral markers, but they cannot be ruled out with our dataset and could be occurring in addition to drift.

while studies have demonstrated a relationship between mhc diversity and resistance to parasites  <cit> , the consequences of low mhc diversity remain unclear. low mhc diversity has been implicated in the rapid spread of an infectious cancer that has caused declines in tasmanian devil populations  <cit> . however, other species appear to have experienced little negative impact, with some able to undergo population expansions  <cit>  and survive thousands of years  <cit> . radwan et al.  <cit>  concluded that most bottlenecked populations do lose mhc variation, but data demonstrating an associated population decline or extinction are scarce, although they point out that studies are biased toward populations that have survived past bottlenecks. in some bottlenecked populations, the remaining alleles are divergent  <cit> , and it is possible that this variation is sufficient for survival under current environmental conditions. the introduction of novel diseases may pose the greatest threat, as genetically uniform species may be less capable of adapting. whiteman et al.  <cit>  found that smaller, more inbred  galápagos hawk populations had higher loads of a coevolved body louse and, in general, lower and less variable natural antibody titres than the larger populations. this suggests that genetic variability may indeed affect this species' ability to mount an effective immune response.

characterization of mhc genes
class ii b genes are prone to duplication and deletion events  <cit> , and gene number may vary both within and between species  <cit> . among birds, it appears that two class ii b genes were present before the major avian radiations  <cit> , and existing bird taxa range in gene copy number from one or two  <cit>  to seven or more  <cit> . the number of sequences we recovered from each hawk  suggests we amplified two loci, which is similar to the one to two loci amplified from other accipitrid species  <cit> . however, we cannot be certain, so two loci is a minimum estimate; it is possible that the primer set we used did not amplify all exon  <dig> sequences or genes actually present. a more thorough investigation of the class ii architecture of these species is needed to determine the true number of genes.

assignment of alleles to particular mhc class ii b genes based on exon  <dig> has proven difficult in birds, possibly because recent gene duplication or elevated rates of gene conversion have resulted in higher intergenic similarity  <cit> . however, the hawk sequences exhibited substructuring, clustering into two groups that may represent separate genes. group  <dig> was notable because of its low sequence divergence compared to sequences in group  <dig>  other studies of avian mhc have also identified genes or clusters of sequences with low divergences, mostly in passerines  <cit>  but also the y complex in galliformes  <cit> . some low variability genes appear to be nonfunctional pseudogenes, having mutations that prevent transcription  <cit> , while others are nonclassical with limited expression and specialized functions  <cit> .

because we used genomic dna, we cannot be certain that the hawk sequences we amplified are expressed. no frameshift mutations or stop codons were present within the region sequenced, and evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues occurred at  <dig> of the  <dig> sites thought to be functionally important for class ii molecules . also, an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions was present in both groups of sequences, which is evidence that selection has acted on these loci, although not necessarily recently  <cit> , and group  <dig> sequences had genetic distances similar to those of expressed sequences from classical mhc loci in other species. more sequence data and expression analyses are needed to better characterize these genes and to determine if the group  <dig> sequences are from pseudogenes or specialized genes. the presence of a group  <dig> sequence in the old world common buzzard suggests that allelic lineage predates the divergences of these buteo species.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we documented low mhc variability in an island endemic, the galápagos hawk, compared to its closest mainland relative, the swainson's hawk. the corresponding loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers  suggests that a founder event at colonization followed by ongoing drift in small populations is the primary cause of low mhc diversity. however, purifying selection or a past selective sweep could also explain the low number of mhc alleles present. the galápagos hawk's low genetic variability may affect its ability to mount an immune response  <cit>  and could be cause for concern should novel diseases reach the archipelago.
