BACKGROUND
ev <dig> is a positive-stranded rna virus in the genus enterovirus of the family picornaviridae, usually leading to hand, foot, and mouth diseases  and herpangina
 <cit> . moreover, ev <dig> has also been associated with fatal pulmonary edema, severe neurological complications, including encephalitis, meningitis, and a poliomyelitis-like syndrome
 <cit> . increasing evidences have found it to be the major etiological agent causing current outbreaks of hfmd in the asia-pacific region, including mainland china
 <cit> . however, the molecular pathogenesis of ev <dig> infection remains obscure.

mitogen-activated protein kinase  belongs to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases. it is widely conserved among eukaryotes and involved in many cellular processes such as inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, movement, and death
 <cit> . to date, seven distinct groups of mapks have been characterized in mammalian cells, including extracellular regulated kinases , jnk1/2/ <dig>  p <dig> mapk , erk3/ <dig>  erk <dig>  erk7/ <dig> and nemo-like kinase 
 <cit> . of these, the most extensive studies are erk1/ <dig>  jnks and p <dig> mapks. as previously reported, jnk1/ <dig> and/or p <dig> mapk pathways is required for infection and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus b <dig>  hepatitis c virus, herpes simplex virus  <dig>  and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
 <cit> . the diverse effects of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk activation by these viruses include induction of apoptosis in infected cells and enhancement of viral replication.

dcs are the first line of defense which could not only promote innate immune response but also initiate specific host immune responses by both capturing and processing antigens to mhc-i and ii molecules on the cellular surface, regulating naïve t cells and differentiation
 <cit> . it has been reported that jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signal cascades are required for ev <dig> replication in rhabdomyosarcoma  cells and sk-n-sh cells
 <cit> . however, little is known about the roles of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways in dcs during the course of ev <dig> infection. in the present study, idcs were induced from pbmc isolated from healthy blood donors in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  and il- <dig>  which used to investigate the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during ev <dig> replication.

RESULTS
differential mrna expressions of molecules in jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways
idcs were prepared from monocytes purified from peripheral blood by induction with gm-csf and il- <dig>  flow cytometric analysis indicated that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of dcs were positive for cd <dig> and cd11c, respectively, and only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cells were positive for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  respectively, confirming that they were indeed idcs. at 1/2 h, 2 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., idcs were collected and the expressions of molecules in jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways were examined by pcr arrays. the results showed that the mrna levels of mek3/ <dig>  mek4/ <dig>  jnk <dig>  jnk <dig>  jnk <dig>  and p <dig> mapk were upregulated by  <dig>  -  <dig>  - fold at different times of ev <dig> p.i. in different time, while c-jun and c-fos were increased by  <dig>  to  <dig>  - fold. in addition, the mrna levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α, and ifn-β were upregulated by  <dig>  -  <dig>  - fold at different times of ev <dig> p.i. .

upregulated and downregulated transcripts are indicated as ‘+’ and ‘–’ values, respectively. the changes of mrna expressions  are indicated by boldface letters.

ev <dig> replication was inhibited in idc preincubated with sp <dig> and sb203580
as specific inhibitors of jnk and p <dig> mapk, sp <dig> and sb <dig>  respectively, were used to study the effects of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk activation on ev <dig> replication. idcs pre-incubated with or without sp <dig> and sb <dig>  for 1 h and infected with ev <dig> at a moi of  <dig> for 24 h and the repilcation of ev <dig> was measured by tcid <dig>  the results showed that the two inhibitors markedly inhibited ev <dig> replication . meanwhile, expression of ev <dig> vp <dig> protein in idcs treated with sp <dig> and sb <dig>  significantly reduced expression of ev <dig> vp <dig> protein at 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., respectively .

activation of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk during ev <dig> infection
it has been reported that jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk are phosphorylated during various virus infection
 <cit> . in order to assess whether activation of these two mapk signaling pathways occurred in ev71-infected idcs, the degrees of total and phosphorylated jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk at 0 h, 1/2 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i. were examined by western blot. the results showed that ev <dig> infection enhanced not only mrna levels of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk  but also their phosphorylation with prolonged infection. the phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> reached its peak at 1 h p.i. , while that of p <dig> mapk reached its peak at 2 h and 24 h p.i., respectively. furthermore, the phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk in ev71-infeced idcs were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk inhibitor  . therefore, jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk play important roles in ev <dig> replication cycle and phosphorylation of downstream molecules.

ev <dig> infection activates and phosphorylates c-fos and c-jun
the activator protein  <dig>  is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of proteins in the subfamilies of c-jun, c-fos, maf, and activating transcription factor . it regulates gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, stress, and bacterial and viral infections
 <cit> . the results of rt-pcr showed that ev <dig> infection  upregulated the expressions of c-fos and c-jun at mrna level. to further investigate whether ev <dig> infection could activate and phosphorylate c-fos and c-jun, total and phosphorylated c-fos and c-jun were detected by western blot. the results showed that c-fos was rapidly phosphorylated by ev <dig> infection, reaching its peak at 24 h p.i.  and this effect was inhibited by pretreatment with sp <dig> for 1 h , but delayed by pretreatment with sb <dig> . similarly, c-jun was also rapidly phosphorylated by ev <dig> infection, reaching its peak within 2 h p.i. . and this effect was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with sp <dig> and sb <dig> . the data demonstrate that ev <dig> infection triggers jnk1/ <dig> or p <dig> mapk-mediated activation of c-fos and c-jun.

secretions of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α,ifn-α and ifn-β
idcs can secrete several cytokines once they are activated by viral infection. to examine the role of jnk1/ <dig> or p <dig> mapk pathways in cytokine secretion in idc, the culture supernatants of control idcs, ev71-infected idcs and idcs pretreated with inhibitor sp <dig> or sb <dig>  prior to ev <dig> infection were collected at 24 h p.i. and used to detect the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  tnf-α, ifn-α and ifn-β using luminex fluorescent technique. the results showed that ev <dig> infection  significantly increased secretions of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-β in idcs, and pretreatment with sp <dig> or sb <dig> only significantly inhibited the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α, but not that of il- <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  ifn-α and ifn-β, indicating that production of the formers, but not the latters, were mediated by jnk1/ <dig> or p <dig> mapk pathways .

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
ev <dig> is a neurotropic picornavirus. its infection could lead to neurological manifestations, ranging from aseptic meningitis to acute flaccid paralysis and brainstem encephalitis and is often associated with systemic features, such as severe pulmonary edema and shock, in young children
 <cit> . the pathogenesis of its adverse clinical outcomes may be related to cell tropism, cell death and host immune responses, etc.
 <cit> . dcs are essential for the induction of innate and specific immune responses against invading pathogens
 <cit> . previous studies have shown that ev <dig> and dengue viruses could increase the viability, activation, cytokine release and t-cell priming activity of dcs
 <cit> . particularly, idcs are highly specialized and efficient in uptaking and processing antigens including various viruses. whereas, jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways also play important roles in proinflammatory cytokine secretions and ev <dig> replication
 <cit> . however, whether ev <dig> infection could activate jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk in idcs and the roles of their activation on ev <dig> replication have not been well explored. in this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways on ev <dig> infection in idcs that are differentiated from pbmc.

the mammalian jnks are encoded by three distinct genes , and they are strongly activated in response to cytokines, uv irradiation, growth factor deprivation, dna damaging agents, growth factors,and viral infection
 <cit> . jnk <dig> and jnk <dig> are expressed in most cell types, while jnk <dig> is found only in brain and testis
 <cit> . the upstream activators for jnk pathway, i.e., map2ks, are mek <dig> and mek <dig> the diversity of upstream activators of mek <dig> and mek <dig>  which enable jnk pathway activation by a large number of external stimuli. in the present study, ev <dig> infection increased mrna levels of mek <dig>  mek <dig> and jnk1/ <dig>  and enhanced jnk1/ <dig> phosphorylation with prolonged infection. the phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> reached its peak at 1 h p.i. pretreated with inhibitor sp <dig> significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> and ev <dig> propagation, indicating that ev <dig> infection triggered jnk1/ <dig> pathway and phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> may be essential for ev <dig> replication.

four isoforms of p <dig> mapk have been identified and named as p <dig> mapk α/β/γ/δ
 <cit> . like all mapks, p <dig> mapk kinases are activated by dual kinases map2ks  and several map3ks, including mtk <dig>  mlk2/mst, mlk <dig>  ask <dig> and tak <dig>  have been reported to cause p <dig> mapk activation
 <cit> . these kinases may confer the specificity of response to different stimuli including virus infection. all mapks, including jnk and p <dig> mapk, are activated by mapk kinases-mediated dual thr and tyr phosphorylation
 <cit> . these residues phosphorylated during activation are thr183/tyr <dig> of jnk and thr180/tyr <dig> of p <dig> mapk. in this study, ev <dig> infection promoted mrna levels of mek <dig>  mek <dig> and p <dig> mapk, as well as phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk. pretreatment of ev71-infeced idcs with p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and ev <dig> replication, indicating that p <dig> mapk pathway also plays an important role in ev <dig> infection.

the transcription factor activator protein  <dig>  is a major downstream target of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk. it is a dimeric complex composed of members of the c-jun, c-fos, maf, and atf protein subfamilies. after activation in the cytoplasm, jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate ser and thr residues of specific ap- <dig> subunits to augment ap- <dig> transcriptional activity. both jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk target to atf <dig> , while jnk1/ <dig> also targets to c-jun and jund
 <cit> . our results showed that ev <dig> infection enhanced mrna level of c-fos and c-jun, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun within 2 h. ev71-induced c-jun phosphorylation was completely inhibited by inhibitor sp <dig> and sb <dig>  in addition, c-fos phosphorylation was inhibited by sp <dig>  but delayed by sb <dig>  thus, we speculated that jnk1/ <dig> is the major kinase responsible for c-fos phosphorylation. these results indicated that ev <dig> infection of idc could activate jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathway cascades, which inturn phosphorylated their downstream molecules such as c-jun and c-fos, and subsequently promted the secretions of proinflammatory cytokines.

proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnf-α, and ifn-β are usually induced by oxidant stress, cytokines, and virus infection, which play important roles in host cell damages, chronic inflammation, and other immunoresponses
 <cit> . ev <dig> infection can stimulate dcs to secrete various cytokines
 <cit> . in the present study, ev <dig> infection of idcs significantly increased the productions of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-β. moreover, the enhanced secretions of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α, but not il- <dig> and ifn, were remarkably inhibited by pretreatment with sp <dig> and sb <dig>  indicating that the enhanced secretions of proinflammatory cytokines, but not il- <dig> and ifn, by ev <dig> infection were mediated by jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways.

to our knowledge, this study is the first report showing that ev <dig> infection activates jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk pathways in idcs and leads to increased viral yield and proinflammatory cytokine secretions. moreover, inhibition of jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk pathways could effectively reduces viral replication and cytokine release, supporting the idea that the activation of these two pathways are important for ev <dig> infection. we speculate that jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk regulate viral replication by acting at certain specific steps of viral replication cycle, including attachment, entry, gene transcription, protein expressions, and assembly, as well as viral pathogenesis. however, the underlying mechanisms need to be further studied in vitro or in vivo to highlight jnk1/ <dig> or p <dig> mapk as a potential broad antiviral molecular target for treatment of ev <dig> infection.
