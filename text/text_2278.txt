BACKGROUND
candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus that is part of the commensal microbial flora in many healthy human individuals  <cit> . when the host immune defences are impaired or when the normal microbial flora is disturbed, the fungus can cause superficial as well as severe systemic infections  <cit> . the transition from commensalism to parasitism is associated with transcriptional changes, and genes encoding adhesins and genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes are often expressed in c. albicans during infection  <cit> . in addition, the formation of hyphae and phenotypic switching are also involved in virulence of the fungus  <cit> . genes belonging to the als  gene family  <cit>  and hwp <dig>   <cit>  encode cell-surface associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchored glycoproteins that mediate adhesion of c. albicans to mucosal surfaces  <cit> . hwp <dig> in particular is a substrate for mammalian transglutaminase, and this adhesin mediates stable attachment of hyphae to epithelial cells  <cit> . c. albicans also contains three gene families that encode hydrolytic enzymes, including the sap , lip  and pl  gene families  <cit> . aspartyl proteases, lipases and phospholipases are enzymes secreted by the fungus which may contribute to colonization and infection by degrading components of host cell membranes  <cit> .

recently, it has become more and more clear that c. albicans infections are often associated with the formation of biofilms  <cit> . c. albicans biofilms are comprised of yeast cells and filaments that are attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces and embedded in an extracellular matrix  <cit> . various model systems have been developed to study c. albicans biofilm biology on mucosal  <cit>  and on abiotic surfaces  <cit> . previous work demonstrated that the reconstituted human epithelium  is a valuable model to study c. albicans biofilms  <cit> . using this model system, it was shown that the expression of hwp <dig> and of genes belonging to the als, sap, lip and plb gene families is associated with biofilm growth on mucosal surfaces  <cit> . the expression of als genes and hwp <dig> has also been investigated in biofilms associated with abiotic surfaces  <cit> . using mutant strains, it was demonstrated that als1p, als2p, als3p and hwp <dig> are important for biofilm growth in vitro and in vivo  <cit>  and that als1p/als3p and hwp <dig> have complementary roles in biofilm formation  <cit> . the determination of gene expression levels is often used to identify candidate genes involved in c. albicans biofilm formation  <cit> . however, it is known that the expression of als, sap, lip and plb genes can be influenced by other factors such as the growth medium, temperature and other environmental conditions  <cit> . as such it can be anticipated that the biofilm model system can have a considerable impact on the expression levels of these genes.

the goal of the present study was to investigate the expression of genes encoding adhesins and genes encoding extracellular hydrolases in c. albicans biofilms grown in different model systems. this study was conducted to identify model-dependent and -independent expression levels of genes encoding potential virulence factors. the expression of hwp <dig> and of genes belonging to the als, sap, lip and plb gene families was quantified in biofilms grown on mucosal surfaces as well as in biofilms grown on abiotic surfaces in vitro and in vivo, using real-time pcr. for this, c. albicans biofilms were grown on silicone in microtiter plates  or in the centres for disease control  reactor, on polyurethane in an in vivo subcutaneous catheter rat  model, and on mucosal surfaces in the rhe model.

RESULTS
c. albicans biofilm formation in the various biofilm model systems
the number of culturable sessile c. albicans cells was determined at selected time point during biofilm formation in the various model systems . after  <dig> h of biofilm formation, the cell number was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> in the mtp and in the cdc reactor, respectively. after  <dig> h, a mature biofilm was obtained in both in vitro models. further incubation did not significantly increase the number of sessile cells. in the in vivo model, the cell number was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> after  <dig> h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> after  <dig> h . in the rhe model, the number of sessile cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> after  <dig> h, and the cell number gradually increased during further biofilm formation. after  <dig> h,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> were obtained in this model system . no tissue damage was observed after  <dig> h in the rhe model . the extracellular lactate dehydrogenase  activity released by damaged epithelial cells gradually increased, and severe tissue damage was observed after  <dig> h .

percentage of filaments in biofilms
the percentage of filaments was determined in biofilms grown in the two in vitro models and in the rhe model, and results are shown in fig.  <dig>  the percentage of filaments in the start cultures  were approximately 5%. in the cdc reactor, the percentage of filaments was  <dig> ± 6%  after  <dig> h, and this percentage gradually decreased. after  <dig> h, only  <dig> ± 7% of all cells was filamentous. after  <dig> h of biofilm formation in the mtp, the percentage of filaments was approx. 2-fold lower than that observed in the cdc reactor . the percentage of filaments also decreased during biofilm formation, and only  <dig> ± 2% of filaments was detected after  <dig> h of biofilm growth in the mtp. in the early stage of biofilm formation in the rhe model, the percentage of filaments is much lower compared to that in the two in vitro models . after  <dig> h, only  <dig> ±  <dig> % of filaments were detected in biofilms. however, the percentage of filaments gradually increased during biofilm formation in the rhe model, which is completely opposite to the results obtained in the two in vitro models. after  <dig> h,  <dig> ±  <dig> % of all cells in biofilms were filamentous.

quality control of real-time pcr assays
basic local alignment search tool  analysis indicated that each primer pair was specific for a particular c. albicans gene, and would not cross-react with sequences from other organisms . pcr efficiencies ranged between 90% and 110% for each of the primer pairs , indicating that all real-time assays had similar good efficiencies. gelelectrophoresis and melting curve analysis confirmed the presence of the expected pcr products only, and the absence of unwanted non-specific products . non-inoculated rhe failed to show evidence of gene expression , confirming that each primer pair was specific for its corresponding c. albicans gene. using the optimized real-time pcr assays, we found that hwp <dig> and all als, sap, lip and plb genes were expressed at all time points during biofilm growth in all model systems tested , as evidenced from a detectable ct value .

expression levels of als genes and hwp <dig> in biofilms
the expression levels  of als genes and hwp <dig> in biofilms at selected time points in the various model systems are shown in additional file  <dig>  als1- <dig> were overexpressed in biofilms grown in all model systems at several time points or during the entire time course. furthermore, hwp <dig> and als <dig> were overexpressed in all model systems except in the mtp and rhe, respectively. als <dig> was only overexpressed in biofilms grown in the cdc reactor, but the fold upregulations were not particularly high. the fold expressions were model-dependent for most of the genes tested. overexpression of als <dig> and hwp <dig> were more pronounced in biofilms grown in the in vivo model, while the expression levels of als <dig> were higher in the two in vitro models. furthermore, the fold upregulations of als <dig> were more pronounced in biofilms grown in the in vivo and rhe models, while those of als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> were higher in the two in vitro models and in the in vivo model.

expression levels of sap genes in biofilms
the expression levels of sap genes in biofilms at selected time points in the various model systems are shown in additional file  <dig>  all sap genes  were upregulated in biofilms grown in all model systems at one or more time points. the expression levels of sap <dig> were rather erratic, and this gene was not considerably upregulated in any of the model systems tested. for most of the sap genes model-dependent expression levels were observed. in in vitro grown biofilms, sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> were highly upregulated, and the fold expression of sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> were also high in the vivo model. furthermore, sap <dig> was highly upregulated in biofilms grown in the in vivo and rhe models. only for sap <dig> and sap <dig> similar gene expression levels were observed in all model systems, although these genes were not expressed at a high level in biofilms.

expression levels of plb genes in biofilms
the expression levels of plb genes in biofilms at selected time points in the various model systems are given in additional file  <dig>  overall, plb genes were not considerably upregulated in biofilms, and only model-dependent differences in gene expression levels were observed. plb <dig> was downregulated in biofilms grown in the mtp and in the in vivo and rhe models, but not in those grown in the cdc reactor. plb <dig> was underexpressed in biofilms grown in the mtp and in the in vivo and rhe models , but this gene was upregulated in biofilms grown in the cdc reactor and in the rhe model .

expression levels of lip genes in biofilms
the expression levels of lip genes in biofilms at selected time points in the various model systems are shown in additional file  <dig>  lip <dig>  lip <dig> and lip <dig> were overexpressed in biofilms grown in all model systems at several time points or during the entire time course. furthermore, lip <dig>  lip <dig>  lip <dig> and lip <dig> were upregulated in biofilms grown in the two in vitro models but not in the in vivo and rhe models. lip <dig> was overexpressed in biofilms grown in the two in vitro models, while this gene was downregulated in the in vivo and rhe models. lip <dig> was upregulated in biofilms grown in both in vitro models and in the in vivo model, but not in the rhe model. similar results were obtained for lip <dig>  except that this gene was downregulated in biofilms grown in the mtp. for all the lip genes , model-dependent gene expression levels were observed. lip <dig>  lip <dig>  lip <dig> and lip <dig> were highly overexpressed in biofilms grown in both in vitro models, whereas lip <dig> and lip5- <dig> were highly upregulated only in the cdc reactor. on the other hand, lip genes were not expressed at a high level in biofilms grown in the in vivo and rhe models.

extracellular lipase activity
extracellular lipase activity in the supernatant derived from start cultures or from biofilms grown in the mtp and rhe model was determined using a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl  palmitate. the relative slope  of the fluorescence-time curves obtained from biofilms grown at selected time points in the mtp or rhe model is shown in fig.  <dig>  no differences in lipase activity were observed between biofilms grown for  <dig> h in the mtp and planktonic cells. between  <dig> h and  <dig> h of biofilm growth in the mtp, lipase activity increased and then remained stable from  <dig> h up to  <dig> h. a marked increase in lipase activity was detected between  <dig> h and  <dig> h of biofilm growth in the mtp. in the rhe model after  <dig> h, lipase activity was approximately  <dig> fold higher than the lipase activity in planktonic cells. lipase activity increased during further biofilm formation and was more than  <dig> fold higher after  <dig> h of biofilm growth in the rhe model, compared to that in planktonic cells.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of genes encoding adhesins and genes encoding extracellular hydrolases in c. albicans biofilms grown in different biofilm model systems. biofilm formation on silicone progressed in a similar fashion in both in vitro model systems, although at later stages , significantly lower cell numbers were obtained in the mtp than in the cdc reactor . this is likely due to a continuous flow of fresh medium in the cdc reactor, absent in the mtp. in the in vivo model, cell numbers were significantly lower than in the two in vitro models . host factors and lack of direct accessibility to nutrients likely contribute to this phenomenon. in the rhe model, cell numbers were similar to those observed in the two in vitro models after  <dig> h. however, cell numbers increased more slowly during biofilm formation in the rhe model, which is likely due to the lack of direct accessibility to nutrients. in order to survive and grow, c. albicans needs to invade and destroy epithelial cells. nevertheless, after  <dig> h cell numbers were similar to those observed in two in vitro models, indicating that a high-density biofilm was obtained. green et al. previously showed that c. albicans inoculated on rhe forms a biofilm-like structure over the epithelial layer  <cit> . furthermore, we observed no considerable tissue damage in the early stages of biofilm formation in the rhe model, whereas further biofilm growth led to a gradual increase in tissue destruction. similar results were obtained in a previous study  <cit> . after  <dig> h, we found that the rhe tissue was almost completely degraded.

using real-time pcr, the expression of hwp <dig> and of genes belonging to the als, sap, lip and plb gene families was detected at all time points during biofilm growth in all model systems tested. it was previously shown that als, hwp <dig>  sap and lip genes are expressed in the rhe model  <cit>  and the expression of plb <dig> but not plb <dig> has also been detected in this model system  <cit> . however, the latter authors used reverse transcriptase pcr   <cit> , whereas we used the more sensitive real-time pcr technique, and this probably explains why we were also able to detect plb <dig> expression. the expression of als <dig>  als <dig> and hwp <dig> has already been observed in biofilms associated with abiotic surfaces  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that not only als <dig>  als <dig> and hwp <dig>  but all the members of the als, sap, lip and plb gene families were expressed in biofilms at all time points in all model systems tested. together, we demonstrated that genes encoding adhesins and genes encoding extracellular hydrolases are constitutively expressed in biofilms grown on mucosal surfaces as well as in biofilms grown on abiotic surfaces in vitro and in vivo.

to identify model-dependent and -independent gene expression in c. albicans biofilms, the fold expression  of each gene was compared between the various model systems. expression levels for each of the genes were determined by quantifying gene expression in biofilms relative to gene expression in the same reference condition , using real-time pcr. by doing so, we found that als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> were overexpressed in all model systems, but their fold upregulations were more pronounced in both in vitro models and in the in vivo model, compared to the rhe model. using mutant strains, it was already demonstrated that als1p and als2p are involved in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces  <cit> . furthermore, als <dig> was highly upregulated in the two in vitro models, and was extremely overexpressed in the rhe and in vivo models. however, deletion of als <dig> did not significantly reduce biofilm formation on silicone and neither resulted in reduced biomass on rhe, but it is likely that als2p compensates for the loss of als <dig>  <cit> . our data clearly show high expression levels for als <dig> in biofilms grown on mucosal surfaces as well as on abiotic surfaces in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for als4p in c. albicans biofilms. for als <dig> and als <dig>  on the other hand, model-dependent up- and downregulations were observed. als <dig> was not overexpressed in the rhe model, which is not surprising as als6p reduces adhesion of the fungus to buccal epithelial cells  <cit> . in both in vitro models and in the in vivo model, on the other hand, we observed an upregulation of als <dig>  using rt-pcr, it was previously shown that als <dig> was weakly expressed in biofilms grown on silicone  <cit> . however, using real-time pcr, we detected low ct values  for als <dig> . furthermore, als <dig> is downregulated in the rhe model, in the mtp and in the vivo model, whereas this gene is slightly upregulated under flow conditions in the cdc reactor. it is possible that shear stress generated in the cdc reactor induces the expression of als <dig>  although further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. we also studied the expression of als <dig> and hwp <dig>  two genes that encode hyphae-specific adhesins  <cit> . their expression levels were higher in the cdc reactor than in the mtp, and the percentage of filaments was also higher in biofilms grown in the cdc reactor. hyphae are known for their increased adhesive properties  <cit> , and presumably shear stress in the cdc reactor triggers the fungus to form more filaments, which in turn express more als <dig> and hwp <dig>  we also found that the percentage of filaments gradually decreased during biofilm formation in both in vitro models. it is known that contact-sensing induces filamentation in c. albicans  <cit> , and therefore it is likely that initial contact of the fungus with the silicone results in filamentation. this could explain why young biofilms contain more filaments than mature ones in both in vitro models. furthermore, als <dig> and hwp <dig> were highly upregulated in biofilms grown in the rhe model, and we found an increase in the percentage of filaments during biofilm formation in this model system. in order to grow in the rhe model, c. albicans needs to invade and destroy epithelial cells, and hyphae are known for their increased invasiveness  <cit> . als <dig> and hwp <dig> were also highly overexpressed in the in vivo model, which is not surprising as hyphae are the predominant form in biofilms grown in this model system  <cit> .

previous research demonstrated that members of the sap gene family are expressed in biofilms associated with mucosal surfaces  <cit> . to investigate whether sap genes are also highly expressed in biofilms associated with abiotic surfaces, the expression of each sap gene was quantified in the various biofilm model systems. all sap genes  were upregulated in the vitro and in vivomodels, supporting recent findings that sessile c. albicans cells associated with abiotic surfaces secrete more aspartyl proteases than planktonic cells  <cit> . in the rhe model, we also observed an overexpression of all sap genes, except sap <dig>  when comparing the fold expression of sap genes between the various model systems, we found that the expression levels of sap <dig> and sap <dig> were similar in all model systems, while for other sap genes model-dependent expression levels were observed. the expression levels of sap <dig> were more pronounced in both in vitro models, while those of sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> were higher in the in vivo model. the expression levels of sap <dig> were rather erratic in both in vitro models, and no considerable overexpression of this gene was found in the in vivo and rhe models. furthermore, the expression levels of sap <dig> were more pronounced in the in vivo model and also in the rhe model at later time points . in in vitro grown biofilms, sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> in particular are highly upregulated. it is known that the main function of saps is to degrade proteins  <cit> , but they were also found to play a role in cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . hence, it is possible that saps are important for adhesion and nutrient acquisition in in vitro grown biofilms, although this hypothesis requires further investigation. furthermore, sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> were highly overexpressed in in vivo grown biofilms, while only sap <dig> was highly upregulated in the rhe model. recently, it was shown that sap <dig> is the only gene that is upregulated as infection of the rhe progressed  <cit> , and our findings are in agreement with this observation. like naglik et al.  <cit> , we found no correlation between the expression of other sap genes and ldh activity, indicating that only sap <dig> may contribute to tissue damage in the rhe model. however, it was recently demonstrated that aspartyl proteases  are not required for invasion of the rhe  <cit> , and this questions the role of sap proteins in biofilms grown in the rhe model. it would be interesting to investigate whether the high expression of sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> in the in vivo model is associated with tissue damage of rats. on the other hand, the elevated expression of sap4- <dig> in the in vivo model could also be associated with the presence of hyphae in biofilms. it is known that sap4- <dig> are predominantly expressed in hyphae  <cit>  and that hyphae are the predominant form in biofilms grown in the in vivo model  <cit> . for sap <dig> and sap <dig>  similar gene expression levels were observed in all model systems. although no considerable upregulations were seen for these genes, we detected much lower ct values for sap <dig>  than for the other sap genes . in the rhe model, naglik et al.  <cit>  recently showed that sap <dig> was the most highly expressed sap gene. it is known that sap <dig> and sap <dig> are not secreted by the fungus, but are gpi anchored proteins that play a role in cell-surface integrity  <cit> . based on our data, sap <dig>  are constitutively expressed at a high level in sessile cells, and it is possible that sap <dig> and sap <dig> play a cell surface-associated role in c. albicans biofilms.

for the plb genes, only model-dependent differences in gene expression levels were observed. overall, these genes were not considerably upregulated in c. albicans biofilms, and this is in agreement with a recent report in which it was shown that planktonic cells produce more phospholipases than biofilms  <cit> . we also found that plb and sap genes were simultaneously expressed in biofilms. it has previously been suggested that phospholipases and proteases have synergistic roles in tissue invasion in the rhe model  <cit> . hence, phospholipases b could also contribute to tissue damage in the in vivo model. on the other hand, the role of phospholipases b in in vitro grown biofilms is more difficult to understand, but it is reasonable to propose that these enzymes play a role in nutrient acquisition. based on our data, plb genes are constitutively expressed in sessile cells in all model systems, although not at a high level, and further research is needed to reveal whether phospholipases b have important functions in c. albicans biofilms.

for most of the lip genes, model-dependent gene expression levels were observed. however, the expression levels of lip genes were rather similar in both in vitro models on the one hand, and in the in vivo and rhe models on the other hand. based on our data, lip <dig>  lip <dig>  lip <dig> and lip <dig> were highly overexpressed in biofilms grown in both in vitro models, whereas lip <dig> and lip5- <dig> were highly upregulated only in the cdc reactor. on the other hand, lip genes were not considerably upregulated in biofilms grown in the in vivo and rhe models. although no high upregulations were seen in the latter model systems, all members of the lip gene family were constitutively expressed in the in vivo and rhe models. we also investigated the extracellular lipase activity in the supernatant of sessile c. albicans cells in the mtp and rhe model. lipase activity was significantly higher in biofilms grown in the rhe model, compared to that of biofilms grown in the mtp . furthermore, an increase in lipase activity during biofilm formation in the rhe model coincided with an increase in ldh activity of damaged epithelial cells. hence, it could be proposed that lipases play a role in the invasion of epithelial tissue in the rhe model. on the other hand, the role of lipases in in vitro grown biofilms is not that obvious. it is possible that lipases play a role in nutrient acquisition  <cit> , particularly in the mtp as nutrients become limited after prolonged biofilm growth. together, our data demonstrate that lip genes are upregulated in biofilms and extracellular lipases are produced by sessile c. albicans cells. however, the role and function of these secreted enzymes in c. albicans biofilms remains to be investigated.

gene expression analysis is often used to identify candidate genes involved in c. albicans biofilm formation  <cit> . previous studies have already examined the global transcriptional response in biofilms grown in particular model systems  <cit> . similar to the in vitro models previously studied  <cit> , the current study found an overexpression of hwp <dig> and of several genes belonging to the als gene family. in addition, analysis of gene expression in biofilms grown in the mtp and cdc also identified differences from previous studies. we found that most of the genes belonging to the sap and lip gene families are overexpressed in biofilms grown in vitro with or without flow. recently, a global transcriptional analysis was performed in an vivo venous catheter biofilm model, and als <dig>  als <dig> and als <dig> as well as sap <dig> and sap <dig> were upregulated in this model system  <cit> . in the present study we found an upregulation of hwp <dig> and of all als and sap genes  in the in vivo subcutaneous catheter rat model. similar to the venous catheter model  <cit> , the current study observed an upregulation of several genes belonging to the lip gene family and a downregulation of plb genes. when comparing previously reported gene expression results from in vitro  <cit>  or in vivo  <cit>  biofilm experiments with the current data, both similarities and differences in gene expression were observed. this again highlights the fact that the biofilm model system can have a considerable impact on gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we can state that hwp <dig> and most of the genes belonging to the als, sap and lip gene families are upregulated in c. albicans biofilms in all model systems tested. future functional analyses of these genes in sessile c. albicans cells will allow us to better understand the exact roles of adhesins and extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in c. albicans biofilms. comparison of the fold expression of genes encoding potential virulence factors between the two in vitro models, the in vivo model and the rhe model revealed similarities in expression levels for some genes, while for others model-dependent expression levels were observed. the present study indicates that gene expression data obtained from different biofilm model systems need to be carefully interpreted. we strongly believe that extrapolation of gene expression data from one model to another is not always feasible, and that it is recommended to use multiple biofilm model systems when studying gene expression in and/or testing anti-virulence strategies against c. albicans biofilms.
