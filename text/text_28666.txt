BACKGROUND
wheat , rice and maize constitute the three most widely consumed cereal grains worldwide. the color of wheat grain endosperm  is determined largely by carotenoid pigments and has been selected according to consumer’s preference during the history of wheat breeding. tetraploid durum wheat  is used for making pasta and couscous and has been selected for increased concentrations of yellow pigments. lutein, a non-provitamin a carotenoid exhibiting yellow color, is the major carotenoid molecule present in the endosperm of the mature tetraploid wheat grains. by contrast, hexaploid bread wheat  has been selected for white flour, resulting in low concentrations of total carotenoids in the endosperm of the mature hexaploid wheat grains . therefore, wheat grain endosperm generally lacks provitamin a carotenoids for conversion into vitamin a in mammals.

since humans cannot synthesize vitamin a from basic hydrocarbon building blocks, this essential micronutrient must be obtained from dietary sources, in the form of preformed vitamin a or provitamin a . considering the indispensable role of vitamin a in human nutrition and the importance of wheat flour in supplying dietary calories, enhancing provitamin a accumulation in wheat grain endosperm holds great promise for staple food-based provision/supplementation of vitamin a nutrition. among the carotenoid molecules that possess provitamin a activities, β-carotene can be converted into vitamin a most efficiently due to its possession of two unmodified β-ionone rings   <cit>  . as such, understanding how carotenoid, particularly β-carotene, accumulation is controlled in wheat grain endosperm is crucial for vitamin a biofortification in this tissue.fig.  <dig> biosynthetic steps leading to lutein and zeaxanthin production in higher plants. linear and/or cyclized carotenoids may be converted to apocarotenoids by ccds. psy, phytoene synthase; pds, phytoene desaturase; z-iso, ζ-carotene isomerase; zds, ζ-carotene desaturase; crtiso, carotenoid isomerase; lcyb, lycopene β-cyclase; lcye, lycopene ε-cyclase; hyds, non-heme di-iron-type carotenoid β-ring hydroxylases; cyps, cytochrome p450-type carotenoid β- and ε-ring hydroxylases; ccd, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase



several metabolic genes controlling β-carotene accumulation have been isolated from wheat, including phytoene synthase  <dig>  that channels carbon fluxes to carotenoid biosynthesis, lycopene ε-cyclase  that diverts the common biosynthetic precursor lycopene to a competing pathway of lutein biosynthesis, and β-carotene hydroxylase1/ <dig>  that enable turnover of β-carotene to downstream hydroxylated products  .

besides hydroxylation, β-carotene and its derivatives can also be modified via conversion into smaller molecules  by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  . of the four plant ccds , coupled actions of ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> are required for biosynthesis of strigolactones from 9-cis-β-carotene in root tissues  <cit> . ccd1s identified from different plant species localize to the cytosol and have demonstrated cleavage activities towards all-trans-β-carotene  and additional linear or cyclic carotenoid substrates at different double bond positions  in in vitro enzyme assays . among the ccd1s identified from monocots, rice and maize ccd1s  have been functionally characterized  <cit> . both enzymes cleave linear  and cyclic  carotenoids symmetrically at c9-c10/c9′-c10′ or c7-c8/c7′-c8′ positions  <cit> . however, overexpression of osccd <dig> in golden rice endosperm  did not change its β-carotene content significantly, arguing against a role of osccd <dig> in carotenoid cleavage in rice endosperm  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether ccd <dig> enzymes can transform carotenoids into apocarotenoid products in other cereal grains, such as wheat.

in contrast to the cytosolic localization of ccd1s, ccd <dig> proteins contain transit peptides for targeting to the plastids  <cit> . correlations between reduced ccd <dig> gene expression/activity and increased carotenoid accumulation or reduced apocarotenoid volatile emission in floral, fruit or storage tissues have been observed in arabidopsis, chrysanthemum, grape, peach, potato and saffron, suggesting a role of ccd4s in carotenoid cleavage in these plants . however, increased violaxanthin accumulation was detected in rnai knockdown lines of stccd <dig> , even though stccd <dig> was unable to cleave violaxanthin in enzyme assays, suggesting that a reduction in ccd <dig> activity may not lead to the accumulation of its immediate substrates in planta  <cit> . when assayed in vitro, the apple and chrysanthemum ccd4s showed substantial cleavage of β-carotene at c9-c10/c9′-c10′, while the arabidopsis, rose and osmanthus ccd4s had little conversion of β-carotene into the apocarotenoid products  <cit> . although csccd4a/b/c of saffron  all cut β-carotene at c9-c10/c9′-c10′, minor cleavage activities of β-carotene at c7-c8/c7′-c8′ were only observed for csccd4c  <cit> . lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin may also serve as substrates for csccd4c as suggested by the carotenoid profiles of nicotiana benthamiana plants transiently overexpressing csccd4c  <cit> .

since polyploid wheat has several subgenomes , multiple homoeologs are present for the carotenoid metabolic genes in wheat. while tetraploid wheat  was formed from the hybridization of t. urartu  and an unknown species from the sitopsis group  about  <dig>  years ago, hexaploid wheat  originated from the hybridization of tetraploid wheat  and diploid wheat   approximately  <dig> to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . it was proposed that genome duplication and evolution in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat may lead to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of gene homoeologs as has been reported for other polyploid plant species . however, neofunctionalization occurs less often in polyploid wheat species due to their relatively short evolutionary time spans  <cit> . moreover, differences among wheat subgenomes are often manifested as differential expression of homoeologous genes . consistent with this notion, we recently observed distinct expression patterns of hyd1/ <dig> and lcye genes and homoeologs in developing tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains   <cit> . particularly, hyd-b <dig> homoeolog expression strongly resembles those of embryo-specific genes  <cit> . these data raised the possibility that carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs could be differentially regulated and may have specific functions in different sections of wheat grains.

the overall objective of this work is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of metabolic genes and homoeologs controlling carotenoid, particularly β-carotene, accumulation in wheat. since ccd1/ <dig> had not been isolated and functionally characterized in wheat, we first cloned ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs from wheat and determined the in vitro enzyme activities of their encoded proteins. we then analyzed and compared carotenoid content as well as expression of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs  in vegetative tissues and three sections of developing tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains.

methods
plant growth and tissue collection
seeds of tetraploid wheat var. kronos and hexaploid wheat breeding line uc <dig> were germinated on pre-wetted filter paper and transferred, at  <dig> d post-germination, to either vermiculite followed by growing in a temperature-controlled growth chamber , or soil followed by growing in a temperature-controlled greenhouse . leaf, stem and root tissues of wheat seedlings were harvested after growing in the chamber for three weeks; the collected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. the greenhouse-grown wheat plants were tagged when first anthers became visible from the middle florets of an ear. developing grains were harvested according to the six defined developmental stages, including watery/ <dig>  early milk/ <dig>  late milk/ <dig>  soft dough/ <dig>  hard dough/ <dig> and ripening/ <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . grains of developmental stages 3– <dig> were dissected, using forceps and scalpels, into pericarp, endosperm and embryo sections. grains at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are not suitable for dissection as stages  <dig> and  <dig> grains are quite small and watery while stage  <dig> grains are very dry. the dissected grain tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. three biological replicates, each containing pooled sections from multiple grains harvested from several plants, were used for gene expression and metabolite analyses. the frozen vegetative tissues and grain sections were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle and stored at −80 °c until further analysis.

rna extraction and cloning of wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs
total rna was extracted from wheat tissues using tri reagent . quantity and quality of the rna samples were determined using a nanodrop® spectrophotometer, according to absorption at 260 nm  as well as the ratios of a260/a <dig> and a260/a <dig> . rna integrity was also evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. first strand cdna synthesis was performed using the biorad iscript cdna synthesis kit with mixed random hexamers and oligo <dig> primers .

the coding sequences of wheat ccd <dig> or ccd <dig> homoeologs are highly similar at the 5′ and 3′ ends. therefore, the same set of primers, except for ccd-b <dig>  was used for amplification of wheat ccd <dig> or ccd <dig> homoeologs and cloning into the pentr/d-topo vector . plasmids extracted from multiple colonies were sequenced in each cloning experiment to identify different homoeologs of ccd <dig> or ccd <dig>  upon sequence confirmation, the ccd1/ <dig> gene homoeologs in pentr/d-topo were then recombined into pdest <dig>  for expression as his-tagged proteins in e. coli. arabidopsis thaliana ccd <dig>  and β-glucuronidase  were also cloned into pdest <dig> and used as positive and negative controls for carotenoid cleavage activities, respectively. to improve the solubility of the recombinant ccd <dig> proteins, his-tagged wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs were also subcloned into the pmal-c2x vector  for tagging of the maltose binding protein . the his-tagged wheat ccd-a <dig> was cloned into pmal-c2x in parallel and used as a control for comparing the cleavage activities between his-tagged and mbp-his-tagged ccd proteins.

when analyzed by targetp  <cit> , wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs were predicted to contain n-terminal plastid transit peptides of various lengths . since it was suggested that removal of subcellular targeting sequences may improve recombinant protein expression in e. coli  <cit> , truncated ccd <dig> homoeologs  were also cloned into pentr/d-topo and then pdest <dig> for protein expression in e. coli. primers used for cloning wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

purification of recombinant proteins and ccd enzyme assays
recombinant plasmids carrying atccd <dig>  gus, wheat ccd <dig> or ccd <dig>  homoeologs were transformed into chemically competent cells of e. coli strain rosetta plyss. the e. coli cells were grown at 37 °c until od <dig> reached  <dig> - <dig> . isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  was added to the bacterial cell culture to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. the cells continued to grow at 16 °c for 20 h and were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> x g for 20 min. purification of his-tagged proteins was carried out using ni-nta agarose beads . mbp-his-tagged proteins were purified using amylose resins . induction and purification of the recombinant proteins were examined by sds-page.

β-apo-8′-carotenal , lutein  and zeaxanthin  were dissolved in ethanol containing  <dig>  % n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside . β-carotene  was solubilized as previously described with slight modifications  <cit> . briefly, β-carotene was dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform with 2 % tween- <dig>  the mixture was dried under vacuum, resuspended in 20 μl of ethanol, and then added to the reaction mixture. for in vitro ccd enzyme assays, the 200 μl reaction mixture included 20 μg purified recombinant proteins, 100 mm tris-hcl ,  <dig>  mm feso <dig>  5 mm ascorbic acid, and the carotenoid substrate . the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °c for 2 h and stopped by extraction with ethyl acetate; 20 μl of the ethyl acetate extract was injected on a reverse phase hplc. the enzyme assays were carried out in triplicate.

recombinant plasmids carrying wheat ccd <dig> or ccd <dig>  homoeologs as well as the gus control were also transformed into e. coli jm <dig>  cells that express pac-beta . an overnight culture initiated from a single colony was used to inoculate 25-ml luria bertani  with 1 % glucose and appropriate antibiotics. the bacterial culture was grown at room temperature with shaking until od <dig> reached  <dig> . iptg was added to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm and the cells continued to grow at room temperature for an additional 12 h. the growth media were then extracted with ether, dried under n <dig>  and resuspended in ethyl acetate; 20 μl of the ethyl acetate resuspension was separated on hplc. the medium extractions were repeated at least three times from independently transformed and grown bacterial cell cultures.

hplc and ms analyses
the hplc program for analysis of ccd enzyme assay products consisted of three solvents:  20 % acetonitrile,  acetonitrile:h2o:triethylamine , and  ethyl acetate. the gradient elution included: 0–2 min, 100 % a; 2–5 min, 100-50 % a and 0–50 % b; 5–10 min, 50-0 % a and 50–100 % b; 10–13 min, 100-75 % b and 0–25 % c; 13–16 min, 75-30 % b and 25–70 % c; 16–19 min, 30-0 % b and 70–100 % c; 19–21 min, 100 % c; 21–22 min, 0–100 % a and 100-0 % c. carotenoid extraction from wheat grain tissues as well as hplc separation and quantification were carried out as previously described  <cit> . the hplc program for analysis of bacterial growth media included  50 % acetonitrile,  acetonitrile:h2o:triethylamine , and  ethyl acetate, with the following gradient: 0–10 min, 100-0 % a and 0–100 % b; 10–13 min, 100-75 % b and 0–25 % c; 13–16 min, 75-30 % b and 25–70 % c; 16–19 min, 30-0 % b and 70–100 % c; 19–21 min, 100 % c; 21–22 min, 0–100 % b and 100-0 % c. the flow rate was maintained at 1 ml min− <dig> for all of the hplc analysis.

mass spectrometry  analysis was performed on a thermo electron ltq-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer . product peaks from the ccd enzyme assays were collected from the hplc runs and used for injection onto the mass spectrometer. an isocratic flow of 50 %  h2o and 50 %  acetonitrile was maintained at  <dig>  ml min− <dig> for ms analysis. the mass spectra were acquired by electrospray ionization  in the positive mode with a mass range of m/z 50–1000 da.

phylogenetic analysis
representative ccd and nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  proteins from different plant species were selected for multiple sequence alignment using multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation   <cit> . the aligned sequences were then used for construction of a neighbor-joining  tree by mega <dig> with the pairwise deletion method  <cit> . robustness of the nj tree was tested with  <dig> rounds of bootstrapping. the rice , sorghum  and maize  ccd and nced sequences were obtained from  <cit> . the genbank  and agi  accession numbers are: atccd <dig>  at3g63520; atccd <dig>  at4g19170; atccd <dig>  at2g44990; atccd <dig>  at4g32810; atnced <dig>  at4g18350; atnced <dig>  at3g14440; atnced <dig>  at1g30100; atnced <dig>  at3g24220; atnced <dig>  at1g78390; caccd <dig>  dq157170; ccccd <dig>  dq157166; cisccd <dig>  ab219165; clccd <dig>  ab219168; cmccd <dig>  dq269467; csccd1a, aj132927; csccd1b, eu523661; cuccd <dig>  ab219164; dcccd <dig>  dq192203; faccd <dig>  aca13522; ofccd <dig>  baj05401; phccd <dig>  ay576003; rdccd <dig>  aby47994; slccd1a, ay576001; slccd1b, ay576002; taccd-a <dig>  ku975445; taccd-b <dig>  ku975446; taccd-d <dig>  ku975447; vvccd <dig>  ay856353; csccd4a, eu523662; csccd4b, eu523663; csccd4c, jn131499; cuccd <dig>  bao18774; cxmccd4a, aby60885; cxmccd4b, baf36656; mdccd <dig>  aby47995; ofccd <dig>  aby60887; ppccd <dig>  jx309999; rdccd <dig>  aby60886; stccd <dig>  xp_006359966; taccd-a <dig>  ku975448; taccd-b <dig>  ku975449; taccd-d <dig>  ku975450; bolcd, aj489277; cszcd, aj <dig>  at, arabidopsis thaliana; bo, bixa orellana; ca, coffea arabica; cc, coffea canephora; cis, citrus sinensis; cl, citrus limon; cm, cucumis melo; cs, crocus sativus; cu, citrus unshiu; cxm, chrysanthemum x morifolium; dc, daucas carota; fa, fragaria ananassa; md, malus x domestica; of, osmanthus fragans; os, oryza sativa; ph, petunia hybrida; pp, prunus persica; rd, rosa x damascene; sb, sorghum bicolor; sl, solanum lycopersicum; st, solanum tuberosum; ta, triticum aestivum; vv, vitis vinifera; zm, zea mays. lcd, lycopene cleavage dioxygenase; zcd, zeaxanthin cleavage dioxygenase.

real-time qpcr analysis
total rna was treated with rnase-free dnase i . cdna synthesis was carried out using 5 μg total rna, random hexamers, and the iscript cdna synthesis kit . primers specific for wheat hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> homoeologs as well as the reference genes were reported previously  <cit> . primers specific for psy <dig>  lcye, ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs were designed and verified using nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines of hexaploid wheat var. chinese spring . the qpcr products were cloned and sequenced to verify amplification of the target gene homoeologs.

real-time qpcr analysis was carried out as previously described using the itaq sybr® green supermix  <cit> . qpcr amplification efficiency for the target gene homoeologs was in the range of 90 % to 121 %. the relative standard curve method was used for quantification of the transcripts  <cit> . cdnas synthesized from whole grains were used for construction of the standard curves in order to allow comparison of homoeologs expressed in different grain sections. normalization of gene expression was carried out using the geometric mean of two reference genes, ta <dig> and ta <dig>  which are stably expressed in different wheat tissues  <cit> .

statistical analysis
one way analysis of variation  followed by unpaired, two-tailed t-test  or tukey’s test  were performed. all statistical analysis was carried out using jmp .

RESULTS
cloning and biochemical characterization of wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs
wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs were identified by searching tigr gene indices as well as the genomic sequences of ae. tauschii and hexaploid wheat var. chinese spring using the arabidopsis ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> sequences as queries. ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs were assigned to different wheat subgenomes based on the wheat rice synteny and the subgenome assignment was verified using nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines of chinese spring . when compared with ccds and nceds that were previously identified from other plant species, wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs fell within the respective ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> clades with strong support . moreover, wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs clustered closely with their monocot relatives .fig.  <dig> a neighbor-joining tree of wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs with selected plant carotenoid cleavage enzymes. bootstrap values are shown next to the branches . wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs are highlighted in bold. ccd, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; lcd, lycopene cleavage dioxygenase; nced, nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; zcd, zeaxanthin cleavage dioxygenase



to determine the catalytic activities of wheat ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs towards carotenoid substrates, purified recombinant proteins of ccd1/ <dig> were used for in vitro enzyme assays . the three wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs cleaved β-apo-8′-carotenal  at the c9-c <dig> position to form β-ionone  and β-apo- <dig> ′-carotendial  . in addition to β-apo-8′-carotenal, wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs also exhibited significant cleavage activities towards lutein, while relatively small amounts of products were generated when β-carotene and zeaxanthin were provided as substrates . it should be noted that β-carotene was only partially soluble in the reaction buffer, which may have limited the accessibility of this substrate to the enzymes.fig.  <dig> in vitro activities of wheat ccd-a <dig> and ccd-a <dig> homoeologs. β-apo-8′-carotenal , β-carotene , zeaxanthin , and lutein  were used as substrates in the enzyme assays. product peaks are indicated by arrows. absorption and mass spectra of the product peaks are shown in 



the c <dig> dialdehyde β-apo- <dig> ′-carotendial  was produced in reactions with β-carotene, zeaxanthin or lutein, suggesting symmetrical cleavage of these carotenoids at c9-c10/c9′-c10′ double bonds by wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs . symmetrical cleavage at c9-c10/c9′-c10′ of the carotenoid substrates was also supported by the release of β-ionone , 3-oh-β-ionone , and 3′-oh-α-ionone + 3-oh-β-ionone  in these reactions . 3-oh-β-ionone and 3′-oh-α-ionone co-eluted at  <dig>  min in the reaction with lutein as substrate, and showed different fragmentation patterns in ms analysis than 3-oh-β-ionone obtained from the zeaxanthin cleavage reaction   <cit> . ccd <dig> activities towards β-carotene were further verified by analyzing the growth media of e. coli cells co-transformed with pac-beta  and ccd <dig> homoeologs. β-ionone was also found in the growth media of β-carotene producing e. coli cells that express wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs .fig.  <dig> characterization of wheat ccd-a <dig> and ccd-a <dig> activities in β-carotene producing e. coli cells. pac-beta contains all the genes for β-carotene biosynthesis. total carotenoids extracted from the growth media of e. coli cells co-expressing pac-beta and various plasmid constructs were analyzed by hplc. hplc elution profiles between  <dig> and 11 min are shown. ascending hplc traces are offset by 12 s for clarity. β-ionone is indicated by arrow. inset: absorption spectrum of β-ionone



unlike the his-tagged ccd <dig> proteins that partially partitioned to the soluble protein fraction, his-tagged ccd <dig> proteins were largely insoluble . ccd <dig> homoeologs were then expressed as mbp-his-tagged proteins and showed improved protein solubility . overall, the purified mbp-his-ccd <dig> proteins did not exhibit any cleavage activity towards β-apo-8′-carotenal, β-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein in enzyme assays . in addition, β-ionone was not detected in growth media of β-carotene producing e. coli cells co-expressing wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs . to demine whether the mbp tag may affect protein activities, mbp-his-ccd-a <dig> was also expressed in e. coli and showed improved protein solubility as compared to his-ccd-a <dig> . comparable cleavage activities of the carotenoid substrates were demonstrated by mbp-his-ccd-a <dig> and his-ccd-a <dig>  indicating that the mbp tag does not affect the activity of ccd proteins . upon removal of n-terminal plastid transit peptides, solubility of his-truncated ccd-4a/b/d proteins was moderately improved . however, his-truncated ccd-4a/b/d proteins were not active towards β-apo-8′-carotenal, β-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein .

carotenoid metabolite profiles in different sections of developing wheat grains
our previous analysis of whole grains revealed progressively decreased carotenoid accumulation during the  <dig> defined stages of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grain development  <cit> . to further investigate spatial carotenoid accumulation in developing grains, total carotenoids from endosperm, embryo and pericarp sections of tetraploid  and hexaploid  wheat grains, at stages 3– <dig> , were analyzed and compared .table  <dig> carotenoid composition and content in developing tetraploid wheat  grain sections

the pericarp of wheat grains contain β-carotene, neoxanthin, violaxanthin and lutein, resembling the carotenoid composition of photosynthetic tissues   <cit> . in the pericarp tissue, similar individual and total carotenoid levels were observed between stages  <dig> and  <dig> of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat; however, there was a consistent drop in carotenoid content at stage  <dig>  which was significant for β-carotene, neoxanthin and total carotenoids . on the other hand, an increasing trend in the ratio of β,ε-/β,β-carotene branch  carotenoids was evident for stages 3– <dig> of grain pericarp , indicating a shift in carotenoid accumulation favoring the α-carotene/lutein branch relative to the β-carotene/zeaxanthin branch .

in contrast to pericarp, lutein and violaxanthin were the only detectable carotenoids in the endosperm of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains . the endosperm of tetraploid wheat consistently accumulated higher concentrations of lutein and violaxanthin than that of hexaploid wheat at each grain developmental stage. as grain endosperm matures, violaxanthin decreased more rapidly than lutein and led to a one-fold increase in the β,ε/β,β ratio at stage  <dig> of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains .

in addition to the carotenoids present in pericarp and endosperm tissues, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin were also found in embryo . particularly, antheraxanthin accounted for about 20 % of total carotenoids in the embryo tissue. as with pericarp and endosperm, total carotenoids in embryo decreased towards the late stage of grain development, contributed mainly by reduced lutein. while the β,ε/β,β ratios in maturing embryo decreased in tetraploid wheat, they remained mostly constant in hexaploid wheat .

expression of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in different sections of developing wheat grains
to assess the spatial contribution of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs to grain carotenoid accumulation, expression of psy <dig>  lcye, hyd1/ <dig> and ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs in pericarp, endosperm and embryo tissues of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains was analyzed using real-time qpcr .fig.  <dig> relative abundance of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in grain sections of tetraploid wheat kronos. different letters indicate significant  differences in transcript abundance between two homoeologs of each gene

fig.  <dig> relative abundance of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in grain sections of hexaploid wheat uc <dig>  different letters indicate significant  differences in transcript abundance among three homoeologs of each gene



in the pericarp tissue, psy-a <dig> and psy-b <dig> showed comparable and similarly decreased expression during tetraploid wheat grain development, except in stage  <dig> where the psy-b <dig> transcript level was significantly higher than that of psy-a <dig> . the preponderance of the b-genome psy <dig> homoeolog was more evident in hexaploid wheat; psy-b <dig> was the major psy <dig> homoeolog expressed in stage  <dig> and the only psy <dig> transcript detected in stages  <dig> and  <dig> . while lcye, hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> homoeologs exhibited similar transcript accumulation through grain development in tetraploid wheat, hyd <dig> homoeologs showed increased expression at stage  <dig> of grain development in hexaploid wheat. in addition, lcye-a was the only lcye homoeolog expressed in the pericarp of hexaploid wheat. of the ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs, ccd-b <dig> expression in pericarp increased gradually towards stage  <dig> of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains. the other ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs showed similar or slightly decreased expression  during tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grain development .

in the endosperm tissue, transcripts of all three psy <dig> homoeologs were under the detection limit of real-time qpcr in hexaploid wheat grains, contrasting to the high psy <dig> homoeolog expression found in tetraploid wheat where decreased psy-a <dig> and psy-b <dig> transcript levels were observed in stages 3– <dig> . interestingly, lcye-a was the only lcye homoeolog expressed in the endosperm of both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains. of the hyd1/ <dig> genes, hyd <dig> homoeolog expression was not detectable, while the hyd <dig> homoeologs showed decreased expression in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat . only ccd-a <dig> and ccd-b <dig> expression was observed in tetraploid wheat grain endosperm. in contrast, all three ccd <dig> homoeologs were expressed in the hexaploid wheat grain endosperm, with ccd-a <dig> and ccd-d <dig> showing increased expression during grain development; on the other hand, none of the ccd <dig> homoeologs had detectable transcript accumulation in hexaploid wheat grain endosperm .

in the embryo tissue, psy-b <dig> and psy-d <dig> were the most abundant psy <dig> homoeolog in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, respectively . lcye-b in tetraploid wheat as well as lcye-a and lcye-b in hexaploid wheat showed increased expression during grain maturation, particularly at stage  <dig>  while hyd <dig> homoeologs had mostly consistent expression in the three grain developmental stages analyzed, enhanced hyd <dig> homoeolog expression was observed at the late stage of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grain development . interestingly, transcripts of ccd <dig>  but not ccd <dig>  homoeologs were detectable in the embryo tissue of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains .

expression of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in vegetative tissues
to determine the genetic factors controlling carotenoid accumulation in vegetative tissues of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, expression of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in three vegetative tissues, including leaf, stem and root, was analyzed by real-time qpcr .fig.  <dig> relative abundance of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in vegetative tissues of tetraploid wheat kronos. different letters indicate significant  differences in transcript abundance between two homoeologs of each gene

in leaves, hyd1/ <dig> and ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs showed similar expression in both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. on the other hand, psy-a <dig> and lcye-a transcripts were relatively more abundant than their corresponding homoeologs in tetraploid wheat, whereas psy-d <dig> and lcye-b transcripts were relatively more abundant than their corresponding homoeologs in hexaploid wheat .

in stems of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, the relative expression patterns among psy <dig>  lcye, hyd <dig> and ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs generally resembled those in leaves. however, expression levels of psy <dig> and ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs were much reduced in stems as compared to leaves . unlike the comparable transcript accumulation of hyd <dig> homoeologs in leaves, hyd-a <dig> appeared to be the major hyd <dig> homoeolog expressed in stems of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat .

in roots of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, psy <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs were under the limit of detection, and lcye homoeologs were absent or very lowly expressed . in tetraploid wheat roots, hyd-a <dig> and hyd-a <dig> were clearly the major hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> homoeologs, respectively. in contrast, comparable expression was observed for the three homoeologs of hyd <dig>  while hyd-d <dig> had only baseline expression in hexaploid wheat roots . ccd-a <dig> and ccd-b <dig> homoeolog expression did not differ significantly for both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat roots, whereas ccd-d <dig> showed two-fold higher expression than the other two ccd <dig> homoeologs in roots of hexaploid wheat seedlings .

discussion
lutein, but not β-carotene, accumulates in the endosperm  of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains at varied levels . while re-directing the carbon flux from lutein to β-carotene formation may be accomplished in wheat grains by blocking the lcye catalyzed reaction as demonstrated in maize grains and potato tubers  <cit> , it is crucial to understand whether the β-carotene produced could accumulate or will be turned over via hydroxylation by hyds or cleavage by ccds . our in vitro enzyme assay results showed that wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs could cleave β-carotene symmetrically, suggesting that ccd <dig> homoeologs can potentially contribute to the degradation of this provitamin a molecule in grains modified with increased β-carotene production . since lutein can also serve as substrate to ccd <dig> homoeologs in vitro and it naturally accumulates in wheat grain endosperm, it is possible that the rate of lutein biosynthesis is higher than that of potential degradation by ccd <dig> homoeologs in this tissue. alternatively, there could be unknown mechanisms that protect lutein from degradation by ccd <dig> homoeologs in wheat grain endosperm.

in contrast to ccd <dig> homoeologs, wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs did not act on β-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin . it remains to be determined whether they could function towards other carotenoid molecules, such as violaxanthin, that were not used for in vitro testing. atccd <dig>  was previously found in the plastid-localized plastoglobules; in particular, it interacts with a zinc finger protein var <dig> in a protein complex required for normal chloroplast and palisade cell development  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine whether wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs are also bound to plastoglobules and cooperates with var3-like proteins. further reverse genetic analysis of wheat ccd <dig> homoeologs will help elucidate their enzymatic functions in planta and the role of their cleavage products in plastid, cell and tissue development.

it was previously shown that maize genotypes with low levels of chy  and lcye transcripts correlate with high levels of β-carotene accumulation in grains  <cit> , which suggests that carotenoid metabolic gene expression may be indicative of their functions in plants. we therefore examined the expression profiles of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs to determine the specific gene homoeologs that control β-carotene accumulation in different sections of developing wheat grains. overall, the gene expression data indicated that homoeologous carotenoid metabolic genes are regulated at the transcriptional level in sections of wheat grains . additionally, tissue specific expression was more prominent than genome specific expression for the carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in wheat . recently, a genome-wide study examined homoeolog expression and genome interplay among three cell types  of hexaploid wheat grains at 10-, 20- and 30-day after anthesis  <cit> . similar to that observed in our gene expression analysis, this study also reported differential expression of homoeologous genes without an overall dominance of a particular subgenome  <cit> . however, embryo and pericarp tissues were not examined and expression of carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs were not analyzed in this report  <cit> .

in developing embryo of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains, lcye-a and lcye-b homoeologs showed increased expression contrasting to decreased lutein accumulation  <cit> , suggesting that mechanisms other than transcriptional control could also be involved in the regulation of lutein metabolism in wheat grains. accompanying largely reduced individual and total carotenoids in pericarp at the late stage of wheat grain development, ccd-b <dig> expression increased sharply, raising the possibility that it may be responsible for carotenoid degradation in pericarp during grain dehydration. this observation is consistent with a recent study in arabidopsis where atccd <dig> expression rose during seed drying  and was shown genetically as a major contributor of β-carotene degradation during arabidopsis seed desiccation  <cit> . however, since whole arabidopsis seeds were used in this study, the spatial location of atccd <dig> expression and β-carotene accumulation within arabidopsis seeds were not determined.

our gene expression results also provided important insights for future attempts to increase β-carotene content in wheat grain endosperm. in the endosperm of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains, hyd <dig> homoeologs were not expressed; ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> homoeologs were either non-detectable or had low level expression, thus may not impact carotenoid accumulation in this tissue. on the other hand, there were significant transcript accumulation of lcye-a  and hyd <dig> homoeologs, suggesting that downregulation or loss-of-function of these homoeologs may be sufficient to result in more β-carotene in the endosperm of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains. since the total carotenoid content in hexaploid wheat grain endosperm is low, more carbons will also need to the directed to the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, such as introducing psy <dig> genes with higher expression or activity, to increase β-carotene levels in hexaploid wheat grain endosperm.

considering the critical roles that carotenoids play in light harvesting and photoprotection, it is important to ensure that downregulation of specific carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in grain endosperm will not compromise carotenoid biosynthesis and function in the photosynthetic tissue. lcye, hyd1/ <dig> and ccd1/ <dig> homoeologs showed comparable expression in leaves , suggesting that loss/reduction of activities of specific carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs in the photosynthetic tissue could be compensated for by the overlapping activities of homologous  and/or homoeologous  genes.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the ccd1/ <dig> enzyme activity and the spatial gene expression analyses suggested that reduced expression of lcye-a and one or more of the loci, including hyd-a <dig>  hyd-b <dig>  and ccd <dig> homoeologs , could lead to β-carotene enrichment in the endosperm of wheat grains without compromising carotenoid metabolism in leaves. identification of the specific carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs controlling β-carotene accumulation will facilitate efficient and effective provitamin a biofortification of wheat grains through plant breeding and genome editing technologies.
