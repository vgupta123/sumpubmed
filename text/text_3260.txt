BACKGROUND
the rho family of gtpases control several important cellular processes, such as cell shape, motility, division and survival through a series of biochemical networks  <cit> . rhogtpases have long been implicated in tumourigenesis, as rho activity is found to be increased in transformed cells and is necessary for the transformation by the ras oncogene  <cit> . the rho proteins act as molecular switches, cycling between an active gtp bound state and an inactive gdp-bound state  <cit> . the rhogtpase activating proteins  down regulate rho by stimulating its intrinsic gtpase activity  <cit> . a significant number of rhogaps have been shown to have altered levels in a variety of human tumours and cell lines  <cit> .

the deleted in liver cancer  <dig>  gene encodes a rhogtpase activating protein  that has been found to be inactivated by deletion or promoter methylation in many tumours, resulting in alterations in cellular proliferation, cytoskeleton reorganization and gene expression in tumour cells  <cit> . a recent study using representational oligonucleotide based microarray analysis showed that heterozygous deletion of dlc <dig> occurred in ~50% of liver, breast and lung tumours and over 70% of colon cancers  <cit> .

the dlc <dig> rhogap is a multi-domain protein that contains a sterile alpha motif  <dig>  interaction domain and a star-related lipid-transfer  domain  <cit> . the dlc <dig> gene shows multiple transcription start sites and alternative splicing. in humans, three major transcriptional isoforms of the dlc <dig> gene has been reported . the predominant  <dig>  kb transcript of dlc <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> kda  <cit> . the existence of proteins for the human mrna isoforms of  <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb  have recently been verified by ko et al.  <cit> . in mouse tissues, two principal transcripts of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb and a minor transcript of  <dig>  kb have been reported by northern blotting  <cit> , but the complete characterization and tissue specific expression of all the isoforms and splice variants of dlc <dig> gene in the mouse has not yet been carried out.

in order to better understand the biological function of various isoforms of dlc <dig>  we have generated a mouse with one of its isoform variants targeted. we have also characterized the different transcriptional isoforms and their tissue specific expression in the mouse. the effect of this gene trap insertion on the other variants has also been studied.

RESULTS
identification, characterization and tissue specific expression of mouse dlc <dig> mrnas and protein
extensive 3' race experiments were carried out in order to determine all possible isoforms and splice variants of the dlc <dig> gene in the mouse . transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the two previously described transcripts of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, which agrees with the current major translated transcripts  found in the vega database . these two transcripts are controlled by two alternative promoters . a previously described  <dig>  kb upstream transcript  had not been linked to dlc <dig> in the mouse; however, it shows partial homology to the human dlc <dig>  <dig>  kb transcript. we therefore included a primer for this transcript in our 3' race experiments. the regions of homology of transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> to the dlc <dig> locus are shown in figure 1b. these results show a linkage of this upstream  <dig>  kb transcript with exon  <dig> of dlc <dig>  including a novel exon not previously reported. based on these complimentary dnas  and others, found in the databases, we predict that there is a  <dig>  kb transcript, which arises from a promoter greater than  <dig> kb upstream from exon  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb dlc <dig> transcript . this  <dig>  kb transcript  contains sequences in common with the previously reported  <dig>  kb cdna . a second  <dig>  kb transcript  starting from the same promoter retains  <dig> bp of intronic sequence downstream of exon  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb transcript . in addition, transcripts of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb  from this same upstream promoter, that do not link to the dlc <dig> gene, were also found .

to confirm these transcripts, northern blotting was carried using a  <dig>  kb ribonucleic acid  probe that contained exon  <dig> to  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb dlc <dig> transcript . this probe revealed the existence of transcripts  in all the tissues examined. however, the  <dig>  kb splice variant was most prominent in the liver and placenta and appeared to be a minor transcript in other tissues.

real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  was carried out in order to quantify the relative expression of the transcripts in various tissues . these results reveal that the dlc <dig> isoforms are expressed abundantly in all the mouse tissues that we examined, which agrees with the data observed by northern blot analysis . however, using real time rt-pcr analysis, the  <dig>  kb transcript seems to be expressed highest in the liver, followed by the placenta, lung, heart, spleen, testis, brain, kidney, thymus and the skin. the  <dig>  and  <dig>  splice variants were expressed at lower levels in the other organs compared with the  <dig>  kb isoform. liver and placenta appears to predominantly express the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts whereas the  <dig>  kb transcript was predominantly expressed in lung, heart and placenta based on real-time rt-pcr, in agreement with the northern blot.

in order to determine the amount of the dlc <dig> protein in different tissues, we carried out western blotting using a polyclonal anti-dlc <dig> antibody that was raised against a peptide containing amino acids residues 111- <dig> from exon  <dig> of the  <dig> / <dig>  kb transcripts . this antibody should pick up proteins translated from the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts as exon  <dig> is common to all three. the dlc <dig> antibody detected a  <dig> kda protein presumably derived from the  <dig>  kb transcript. the western blot revealed a very high expression of  <dig> kda dlc <dig> protein in the liver, placenta and spleen. the molecular weight of the dlc <dig> protein derived from the  <dig>  kb transcript is predicted to be  <dig> kda. in the same western blot test we found a band of approximately  <dig> kda, which showed a high expression in the thymus, lung, testis, spleen and liver . sometimes a doublet of the  <dig> kda band was seen, which suggests a possible post-translational modification. further experiments will be needed in order to confirm the identity of the  <dig> kda band and the other cross reacting proteins. with this antibody, we were not able to detect any proteins in the region of  <dig>  kda - the predicted size of the protein from the  <dig>  kb transcript . the expression profile of dlc <dig> isoforms among different tissues were correlated, to some extent, with the quantitative pcr and the northern blot.

methylation status of the alternative promoters of dlc <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts
since the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts showed differential tissue expression, we wanted to determine if this was reflected by differences in promoter methylation. we used bisulphite treatment of dna followed by pcr and pyrosequencing to study the promoter methylation status of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts in various tissues. for our studies, we targeted five cpg islands located  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon for the  <dig>  kb transcript and four cpg islands located  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of  <dig>  kb transcript . the pyrosequencing revealed much lower methylation of the  <dig>  kb promoter region  in the  <dig> cpg islands; the  <dig>  kb promoter region showed a higher percentage of mean methylation of 60-65% in all the tissues examined .

characterization of the mice heterozygous for the gene trap allele
since there were several embryonic stem cell lines available with exon  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb transcript gene trapped , we made a mouse using an embryonic cell line, named xe <dig>  to assist the functional characterization of this isoform. we determined the integration site of the promoter trap plasmid in this line by inverse pcr and used this information for genotyping the transgenic mice made with this line . adult mice heterozygous for the dlc <dig> gene trap did not show any gross physical, histological or behavioural abnormalities. as well, we have not seen any spontaneous tumours in heterozygous mice living to at least  <dig> years of age.

multiplex rt-pcr  and real time rt-pcr analysis  showed a reduction of the  <dig>  kb transcript in the homozygous gt serum free mouse embryonic cell lines  compared with wild type and heterozygous lines. the  <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  transcripts showed only a slight reduction, despite the fact that all three transcripts can be spliced into the βgeo reporter cassette . these results indicate that the gene trap's main effect resulted in hypomorphic expression the  <dig>  kb isoform.

abnormalities in the dlc1gt/gt embryos
no mice homozygous for the gt dlc <dig> allele were observed at birth from heterozygous intercross matings. histological analysis of  <dig> - <dig>  days post coitum  embryos from heterozygous matings showed that dlc1gt/gt embryos were necrotic and displayed growth retardation that varied in severity . most of the embryos had a retarded brain structure and an abnormally enlarged heart . the presence of the βgeo cassette in the gene trap vector allowed for expression analysis of the dlc <dig> gene after x-gal staining. the anterior neural tube was open and contorted in the homozygous gene trapped embryos . x-gal stained hearts showed thin and underdeveloped atrial and ventricular walls with an apparent lack of blood cells inside the heart . the homozygous gt mice also showed an absence of blood vasculature in the yolk sac  and in the placental labyrinth . the haematoxylin and eosin  stained sections of dlc1wt/gt placental labyrinths at  <dig>  dpc showed sinusoids with maternal enucleated red blood cells  and embryonic blood vessels with nucleated fetal erythrocytes in close proximity with each other . in contrast, the embryonic and placental vasculature was severely reduced in the dlc1gt/gt placenta, as revealed by immunofluorescent staining with the endothelial and haematopoietic cell marker cd <dig> . h&e staining of the dlc1gt/gt placenta also showed aggregates of erythrocytes in collapsed blood vessels . x-gal staining of the  <dig>  dpc homozygous gt embryos revealed a strong expression of the beta-galactosidase fusion protein in the anterior part of the notochord, somites, liver, heart, lung, forebrain, placenta and tail bud . the defects in placenta and the vitelline blood vessels are probably the cause for the embryonic lethal phenotype of the homozygous gene trapped embryos.

reduced level of dlc1protein in a serum free dlc1gt/gt mouse embryos cells
dlc <dig> protein expression was determined in serum free mouse embryo cell lines  derived from  <dig>  dpc embryos. the homozygous dlc1gt/gt sfme cells showed significantly reduced dlc <dig> protein levels  in western blots compared with the heterozygous or wild type cells . we found specific reduction of the  <dig> kda band corresponding to the predicted size of the  <dig>  kb transcript of dlc <dig>  there was also an increase of a cross reacting  <dig> kda band in the homozygous gt cells when compared to the wild type and heterozygous lines. this protein size corresponds to the predicted size for the  <dig>  kb transcript.

dlc1gt/gt sfme cells showed increased rhoa activity and an altered cytoskeleton along with increased cell motility
if dlc <dig> activity is reduced in the gene trapped cells, one would expect to see an increase in active rho activity. the active rho levels in the dlc <dig> deficient sfme cell lines were measured by a rho-gtp pull-down assay. the dlc1gt/gt cells showed a significantly higher  constitutive level of active gtp bound rhoa . the induction of active rho following lpa treatment was also significantly higher  in the dlc1gt/gt cell line compared with the dlc1wt/wt or dlc1wt/gt lines. since rhoa has been implicated in podosome formation in osteoclasts  <cit>  and dendritic cells  <cit> , we wanted to see if the subcellular localization of endogenous active rhoa was altered using an in situ rho-gtp affinity assay. as in the active pull down assays, increased levels of active rhoa was detected by gst-rho binding domain  protein staining in the dlc1gt/gt cells when compared with the wild type and heterozygous cells .

the formation of actin stress fibres and focal adhesions were compared among the various sfme lines detected by fluorescent conjugated phalloidin and anti-vinculin antibody staining . the dlc <dig> gt cells showed a significant increase  in actin stress fibre formation and increased vinculin associated focal adhesions, when compared with the wild type and heterozygous cell lines.

it has been previously reported that active rhoa activity can down regulate p21waf <dig> expression  <cit> . the dlc1gt/gt cells also showed significantly reduced  constitutive levels of the p21waf <dig> protein in comparison to the cell lines derived from heterozygous and wild type embryos . we have also found a positive correlation between reduced expression of dlc <dig> and p21waf <dig> in cell lines . the preceding results indicate that the dlc <dig> gt cells showed increased rhoa activity.

rho proteins are important players in the regulation of cell motility and reduced expression of dlc <dig> enhances cell migration. in order to study the effect of hypomorphic expression of dlc <dig> on directed cell migration, we performed scratch assays by wounding confluent monolayers of mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from wild type, heterozygous and homozygous embryos. the dlc1gt/gt cells showed more rapid wound closure that was significantly different compared to the rate of wound closure in wild type and heterozygous cells , indicating increased cell motility. the amount of wound closure decreased slightly at longer times, possibly due to change in direction of cell movement.

discussion
alternative splicing and promoter usage of genes allows for an expansion of protein diversity and control. recent evidence suggests that 30%-50% of the human and mouse genes have multiple alternative promoters  <cit> . in humans, at least three transcriptional isoforms  of dlc <dig> gene have been identified that are expressed under the influence of three alternative promoters spanning approximately  <dig> kb. the mouse dlc <dig> gene on chromosome 8b <dig> and the human gene on 8p <dig> have an almost identical exon/intron structure, except for the presence of an extra codon in exon  <dig> of the mouse  <cit> . in a previous study using 5' race and northern blotting analysis, durkin et al. reported the presence of  <dig> dlc <dig> transcripts in the mouse of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in length  <cit> . however, in our study using extensive 3' race and northern blot analysis, we have found four major transcriptional isoforms of dlc <dig> . the complete characterization of the  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb transcripts lead to the identification of a novel exon of  <dig> bp in length, which connects the dlc <dig> gene upstream of exon  <dig> to an additional  <dig>  kb of exon sequences, resulting in the  <dig>  kb fusion transcript. the upstream  <dig>  kb exon sequences were generated from a previously uncharacterized gene 5' of dlc- <dig> . it is interesting to note that comparison of the mouse  <dig>  kb mrna with the human  <dig>  kb transcript revealed that the 5th exon is exactly  <dig> bp in length and only differs in its relative position within the intronic sequences. the conserved nature of this novel exon sequence supports a functional significance for the  <dig>  kb mrna. the human  <dig>  kb, kia <dig>  cdna has the potential to encode for a  <dig> amino acid protein  <cit> . recently ko et al. have shown high expression of a greater than  <dig> kd protein in the human heart tissue using an antibody based on this cdna sequence  <cit> . the putative promoter region of both the human and mouse dlc <dig>  <dig>  kb mrna is approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the exon  <dig> of the dlc <dig>  <dig>  kb transcript. shorter transcripts originating from this promoter are also found, which do not encode dlc <dig> rhogap related sequences. the existence of this larger dlc <dig> polypeptide has not yet been verified in the mouse and we have not yet seen a protein of this size on our western blots. the mouse  <dig>  kb transcript retains only exon  <dig> and  <dig> of the regular dlc <dig> transcripts and would not encode a rhogap related protein. understanding the function of these shorter transcripts will have to await specific knockout mouse models. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the three isoforms reveals that these isoforms have a conserved domain structure and that they may be functionally redundant. however, these isoforms were not sufficient to rescue the embryonic lethal phenotype of our homozygous gt mice.

the gene fusions observed in the  <dig> / <dig>  kb transcripts may be due to the bypassing of 3' end formation sites that has been observed for other genes in the fantom database  <cit> . exon  <dig> of the a730069n07rik transcript contains two successive polyadenylation signals tgtttt and aataaa, which are considered weak in comparison to the presence of three successive polyadenylation signals   <cit>  present in the 14th exon of regular dlc <dig> transcripts. the weak polyadenylation signal may be responsible for bypassing the 3' end formation and lead to the formation of a fusion transcript between the genes. however, the conserved nature of the exon  <dig> of the  <dig>  transcript contradicts this finding and further study is necessary in order to validate these observations.

the  <dig>  kb dlc <dig> transcript is predicted to encode a  <dig> kda protein, which is highly expressed in the forebrain, anterior tip of the notochord, somites, liver, heart and placenta, suggesting an important role for this dlc <dig> isoform in the development of theses organs. the  <dig>  kb alternative transcript contains a novel first exon located  <dig> kb upstream of exon  <dig> and potentially codes for a  <dig> kda protein. the first exon of the  <dig>  kb transcript substitutes  <dig> aa of the first  <dig> aa of the  <dig>  kb dlc <dig> transcript. the existence of the  <dig> kda dlc <dig> protein has not yet been fully validated. however, in our western blots, using an antibody raised against a peptide to exon  <dig>  we identified a band equivalent to  <dig> kda. the expression level of  <dig> kda dlc <dig> protein showed tissue specific differences from the  <dig> kda protein. for example, testes showed expression of the  <dig> kda band and reduced levels of the  <dig> kda band . there is possibility that the  <dig> kda protein is a cross reacting non-specific protein. however, we argue that the  <dig> kda band is the protein product of the  <dig>  kb isoform because of its molecular weight, which almost exactly matches the predicted protein product of  <dig>  kb isoform. another reason for such an argument is that the  <dig> kda protein band has increased intensity in the dlc1gt/gt cell line as opposed to the wild type or heterozygous cell lines. this may be explained as a cellular response to complement the reduced level of  <dig>  kb transcript in the gt cells or an effect of the relative abundance of  <dig>  kb isoform. the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb dlc <dig> isoforms may be functionally redundant because of their structural resemblance and, thus, could complement each other. recently, such functional redundancy has been shown by ko et al. in a study using myc tagged dlc <dig> isoforms expressed in hepatoma cell lines  <cit> . they showed that human dlc <dig> isoforms α and β  could suppress stress fibre formation in vitro. however, further experimentation is necessary in order to test such a claim.

the n terminus of dlc <dig> protein contains a sterile alpha motif  <dig> interaction domain, amino acids 13- <dig> in the  <dig>  kb and 47- <dig> in the  <dig>  kb transcripts. the sam domain is a motif that occurs in many transcription factors and signalling proteins  <cit> . the  <dig> and  <dig> kda dlc <dig> proteins differ in exon  <dig>  which is a short stretch of amino acids upstream of the sam <dig> domain. deletion of the sam domain increases the velocity of cell migration but reduces directionality by acting as a negative regulator of dlc1rhogap activity  <cit> . a truncated version of dlc <dig> protein that contains the n terminal domain, but not the gap domain, localizes to focal adhesions and can act as a dominant negative protein  <cit> . recently, in hamster kidney cells, co-localization of dlc <dig> protein with caveolin- <dig> in focal adhesions was found to be independent of the sam domain  <cit> . however, the dlc <dig> sam <dig> domain has been shown to interact with the elongation factor ef1a <dig>  targeting it to the membrane periphery and membrane ruffles  <cit> .

it is possible that exon  <dig> of the dlc <dig> isoforms may interact with different proteins or allow different subcellular localization for the spatial regulation of cell movement. in that case, the  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb isoforms may not be able to rescue each other's rhogap activity due to different interacting partners or subcellular localization. alternatively, the two isoforms may have different temporal or tissue specific expression during development, a theory which is supported by our results. experiments that will test these possibilities are ongoing.

the mean frequency of the promoter methylation for the dlc <dig> isoforms helps to explain the tissue expression pattern. the promoter of the  <dig>  kb transcript showed a significantly lower mean percentage of cpg methylation  compared with the promoter of  <dig>  kb transcript . hypermethylation of the dlc <dig> promoter is a common mechanism for transcriptional repression of the dlc <dig> gene in several human malignancies and hypermethylation of the  <dig>  kb transcript promoter is usually found in human tumours  <cit> .

the gene trap insertion occurred within intron  <dig> of the dlc <dig>  <dig>  kb transcript and this allowed us to examine the functional significance of the specific loss of this transcript. the gene trap vector inserted in the dlc <dig> locus should delete the majority of the downstream coding sequences if obligatory cleavage and polyadenylation at the sv <dig> polyadenylation signal of the gene trap construct occurs. by multiplex pcr, we showed the existence of fusion transcripts for all three of the dlc isoforms spliced to the βgeo coding region. however, only the  <dig>  kb transcript was significantly reduced, resulting in the hypomorphic expression of the  <dig> kda protein and subsequent phenotypic abnormalities in the mouse. the hypomorphic expression was presumably due to low level splicing around the gene trap plasmid insert. there is a possibility that the phenotypic abnormalities in our study could be due to the disruption or deletion of a microrna expressed from this intron  <cit> . however, we have not found any evidence of any known micrornas anywhere near or within this intron of dlc <dig> in the mirbase database, as well as any computationally identified candidate microrna genes <cit> . also, our gene trapped mouse phenocopies the dlc <dig> exon  <dig> knockout mouse of durkin et al.  <cit> . these results suggest that the gt es cell libraries maybe a useful resource for studying specific knockdown of transcriptional isoforms and splice variants of genes.

the dlc <dig> gene plays a critical role in regulating cellular functions during early murine development. the abnormalities found in the dlc <dig> gt embryos are a common occurrence in mouse gene knockouts that result in death at the early stages of embryogenesis, due to organ systems failure  <cit>  and are often associated with cardiac or placental defects  <cit> . the abnormally enlarged heart, lack of yolk sac blood vessels and underdeveloped blood capillaries in the placental labyrinth of the homozygous dlc <dig> gt embryos appeared at a developmental stage when the dlc <dig> transcripts are normally expressed and, most probably, caused the embryonic lethality. whether the heart and brain defects are a direct result of dlc <dig> loss or a consequence of the lack of placental blood vessel formation will have to await the isolation of conditional dlc <dig> knockout mice.

previously, it has been shown that targeted disruption of mouse rho associated coiled coil kinase- <dig>  gene resulted in intrauterine growth retardation and defective branching morphogenesis of the placental labyrinth  <cit> . the rock-ii mrna has been found to be expressed abundantly in placenta  <cit> . the active form of rhoa binds to rock kinase, which phosphorylates myosin phosphatase, resulting in increased myosin light chain  phosphorylation allowing contraction  <cit> . the rho/rock signalling pathway also contributes to the ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction  <cit> . rhoa is abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle and its activation increases vascular tone, resulting in increased permeability  <cit> . rho gtpases has long been implicated in the regulation of endothelial permeability  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that increased expression of constitutively active rhoa induced cell rounding and apoptosis of endothelial cells  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that dlc <dig> protein plays a significant role in placental and heart development due to its regulatory effect on rho/rock signalling pathway.

the dlc <dig> protein has been reported to be localized to the focal adhesions as shown by colocalization with the focal adhesion protein vinculin  <cit> . focal adhesions are a structural link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and are regions of signal transduction that can regulate growth control  <cit> . we have shown that the formation of actin stress fibres and vinculin rich focal adhesions were significantly increased in the hypomorphic dlc1gt/gt sfme and fibroblast cell lines. dlc <dig> has been implicated in the phosphoinositide and rhogtpase signalling pathways, both of which can regulate stress fibre formation and focal adhesions assembly  <cit> . similar findings have been reported by holeiter et al. in breast cancer cells using sirna mediated knockdown of dlc <dig> transcripts  <cit>  and xue et al. in embryonic liver progenitor cells using shrna  <cit> . in contrast to our results, durkin et al. reported that their knockout mice showed reduced actin stress fibre and vinculin rich focal adhesions in their dlc1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells  <cit> . a possible reason for this may be that the culturing of our sfme cells on fibronectin coated plates, may stimulate the rho signalling allowing the formation of stress fibres. using soluble gst-rbd in order to detect endogenous rhogtp, we have been able to show that the dlc1gt/gt cells exhibit increased rhoa activity and subcellular localization of active rhoa at the focal adhesions. similar findings have been previously reported by berdeaux et al. in nontransformed fibroblasts  <cit> . rho proteins are important regulators of cellular migration  <cit> . in addition to the cytoskeletal changes, the dlc1gt/gt mef cells showed significantly increased cellular migration in wound closure assays compared with the heterozygous or wild type mefs. similarly, holeiter et al. found rapid wound closure in scratch assays using rnai to knockdown dlc <dig> in mcf <dig> breast cancer cells  <cit> . the cellular migration rate decreased as the cells approached to the midline of the wound from both sides, which might be because of changes in the direction of migration due to contact or the depletion of nutrients in the media. all of this evidence is consistent with the suggestion that dlc <dig> deficiency may be a driving force for cellular migration by remodelling the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions.

recently, it has been shown that in h-ras oncogene transformed fibroblasts, rhoa may cooperate in transformation by suppressing the cell cycle inhibitor p21waf <dig> that is induced by the sustained activation of the erk-map kinase pathway  <cit> . in our study, we saw increased rhoa activity and a reduced level of constitutive p21waf <dig> expression in the dlc1gt/gt sfme cells. the reduced expression of dlc <dig> and p21waf <dig> in the dlc <dig> deficient cell lines was positively correlated. it is possible that activation of the rho pathway through mutation of the dlc rhogaps will complement the ras oncogene in cell transformation in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that the dlc <dig> gene has four transcriptional isoforms expressed under the influence of three alternative promoters. the alternative promoters are differentially methylated in mouse tissues and this relates to the differential expression of the proteins in the tissues examined. we also identified a  <dig> kda dlc <dig> protein that may originate from the  <dig>  kb alternative transcript. we generated a dlc <dig> gt mouse that resulted in hympomorphic expression of the  <dig>  kb transcript and the  <dig> kda dlc <dig> protein. the homozygous gt dlc1gt/gt mouse embryos showed significant abnormalities in yolk sac and placental labyrinth vasculature suggesting an important developmental role for the  <dig>  kb isoform of dlc <dig> during early embryonic development. a deficiency of this isoform resulted in increased gtp-rho levels resulting in more stress fibre and vinculin associated focal adhesion formation. this in turn resulted in heightened cellular mobility.
