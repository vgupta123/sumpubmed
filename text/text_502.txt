BACKGROUND
large-scale “omic” experiments that capture the physical associations and links between genes, proteins and other molecular components within the cells are producing extensive data on biomolecular interactions which are stored in new generation databases and resources  <cit> . the human interactome, for example, is composed of around  <dig>  protein-coding genes, around  <dig> metabolites and a still undefined number of distinct proteins and functional rna molecules  <cit> . in total, this sums up to more than  <dig>  cellular components expected to form the complex machinery of human cells. these components are related to each other in different ways. the number of relations and functional associations substantially exceeds the number of components, making the interactome a large relational system difficult to depict and analyze. despite this complexity, the nature of the cellular interactomes allows to render or transcribe them into biomolecular “networks” that can integrate different layers of information to generate comprehensive spaces, providing a better view of the cellular systems. moreover, the “networks” can be analyzed with computers to explore and quantify the centrality and the weight of the different components, and to find clusters or modules of highly related elements. this is the framework that drived us to develop the bioinformatic application tool here presented, called path2enet.


path2enet is an r package that reads the relations and links between proteins stored in the major and highly curated pathways database kegg   <cit>  and integrates them with gene expression data from various resources as well as experimentally determined data from protein-protein physical interactions taken from apid  <cit> . path2enet tool uses the expression data to determine if a given node  in a generated network is active  or inactive  in a specific cellular context, cell type or condition. the transformation of pathways into comprehensive networks plus the mapping of active –i.e., expressed– nodes, can help researchers to integrate different levels of molecular information, placing it in a relational specific context. in addition, the integration of protein-protein interaction data within a pathway-network view can help to find relevant relations and critical nodes in the processes studied. as a practical example, we applied path2enet tool to the analysis of the notch signaling pathway in human lymphocytes in order to uncover the specific differences between b cells  and t cells .

methods
integration of pathways, molecular interactions and expression resources

path2enet is an r package that uses and integrates several databases and resources to generate pathway-derived networks in an expression specific context. these resources are the following:  pathways data, the tool collects the pathways information from kegg, taking the kgml-files and generating a mysql database from such files   <cit> ;  protein-protein interaction data, the tool also uses a dataset of human protein-protein physical interactions  from the dataserver apid  <cit> , which at the time of building the package contained  <dig>  unique interactions of human proteins; and  gene expression data, the tool integrates four types of expression information. these are:  ests  from the unigene database that includes  <dig>  gene/protein entries detected in  <dig> human tissues ;  barcode gene expression from high-density oligonucleotide microarrays that store  <dig>  gene/protein entries detected in  <dig> tissues and cell lines  <cit> ;  rna-seq data of the human body map  <dig>   that stores fpkm expression data of  <dig>  gene/protein entries in  <dig> human tissues  rna-seq data from the human protein atlas which stores the fpkm expression data of  <dig>  gene/protein entries of  <dig> human tissues   <cit> .

calculation of expression level to identify on/off genes
beside the pre-processed expression datasets provided in several of the integrated resources, path2enet uses the gene expression barcode algorithm with the r package frma  <cit>  to evaluate if a gene is expressed  or not  in a studied set of samples. the user can also incorporate and apply in path2enet his own expression on/off thresholds, for example using experimental rna-seq data. however, the identification of such thresholds is not trivial and the barcode algorithm is most efficient in this task.

id mapping and data unification
for the id mapping and integration, path2enet uses brainarray  <cit>  or gatexplorer  <cit>  within r to annotate the probe-set identifiers of the microarrays to ensembl gene identifiers.

to achieve a correct unification of databases and resources, path2enet uses as key identifiers  of the genes/proteins the entry ids from uniprotkb database  <cit> . therefore, the kegg gene and ensembl gene identifiers in the datasets are annotated to the uniprot entry ids using the mapping tables that uniprot provides. path2enet also uses the r package rmysql  <cit>  to build and to connect to the mysql databases using r programming. finally, in order to build the networks, path2enet uses the r package igraph  <cit> , which is a tool that provides outputs that can be introduced in cytoscape.

selection of an experimental dataset to apply path2enet
as a practical example, we applied path2enet to analyze the notch signaling pathway in human lymphocytes, detecting the way in which this pathway is expressed in these cells and also finding the specific differences in activated genes/proteins between “naive” b cells  and t cells. to perform this analysis we downloaded and normalized an expression dataset that included  <dig> human samples. these samples were genome-wide expression microarrays of platform human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  from affymetrix . the samples corresponded to naive b cells ,  <dig> microarrays; t cells ,  <dig> microarrays; and t cells ,  <dig> microarrays. the specific. cel files  that correspond to these samples are indicated in additional file  <dig>  and are available in the gene expression omnibus  database from ncbi.

software availability and implementation

path2enet has been developed in r . in this way, a full operative r package has been built and it is available at http://bioinfow.dep.usal.es/path2enet. the software will be uploaded to the r cran package repository  once this article is published. an r vignette  is provided as a guided tutorial to facilitate the installation and use of the path2enet package.

RESULTS
building networks and performing analysis with path2enet

path2enet is a bioinformatic application tool that integrates the information of pathways, protein-protein interactions and expression datasets  from different tissues and cell types. path2enet uses these datasets to build a network view of biological pathways in an expression-specific context. the tool is capable of identifying the genes/proteins that are on in specific samples appliying the barcode algorithm, and allows the use of specific experimental expression data to present focused views of the human pathways map as specific biomolecular networks.

in the networks built using path2enet, the “nodes” correspond to the proteins included in the queried pathway plus the information about the active- or inactive-state of such proteins . the “edges” of the network correspond to the links or associations between the biomolecular entities . these links can be activation, inhibition, expression, phosphorylation, etc. in order to facilitate further analysis of the networks, the edges generated by path2enet are taken as undirected.

considering the coverage over the map of human pathways, path2enet can generate two different types of networks. the first is the “local” network which strictly includes the nodes of the canonical pathway selected from kegg. for example, in the case of the notch signaling pathway   the “local” network retrieves the  <dig> genes/proteins that are included in this pathway for human . thus, path2enet generates a network where each node is a protein and the edges are colored according to the type of association reported in the pathway . the second type of network that path2enet can build is the “global” pathway-network that includes all the “local” nodes and links from a given kegg pathway, plus all the extra “external” nodes that such nodes can be linked to in other pathway charts . in this way, path2enet is not restricted to predefined pathways since it can create large networks blending multiple layers of biological information.fig.  <dig> figure showing the notch signaling pathway and the transformation into a network using path2enet:  the canonical map included in the kegg database , showing all the distinct proteins that are included in each node of this pathway ;  transfromation of the canonical pathway to a network done with path2enet, that produces a new view incorporating all the information about the gene products that are expressed  based on the pathway and on the expression data sets of lymphocytes that are incorporated . path2enet uses the gene expression barcode algorithm to evaluate if a gene is expressed  in the network or not . the genes in blue correspond to na  since the tool could not assign them because they are not present in the expression platform used. the panels inside the figure indicate: "edges" the characteristics of the links/relations that connect each node ; "nodes" the expression level assigned to each node in the sample type studied that in this case were lymphocytes 




once a network is built with path2enet, calculations of the network topological parameters  can be performed, because the tool generates igraph objects  <cit> , that can be studied with graph analysis tools. in this way, path2enet provides ways to identify hubs and clusters in the network.

application of path2enet to build the notch pathway-network of b and t cells
in the case study presented in this article we used path2enet to generate expression networks of the notch signaling pathway in three types of human cells: b cells  and t cells  . to achieve this, we used a sample dataset of microarray expression .fig.  <dig> pathway-expression-networks produced for b cell cd19+ , t cell cd8+  and t cell cd4+  based on the transformation of the notch signaling pathway done with path2enet. the tool removed all nodes below the expression treshhold of  <dig> . the expression network produced for b cells reveals  <dig> active nodes  plus  <dig> nas out of  <dig> proteins and  <dig> edges . the expression network for t cells reveals 22– <dig> active nodes  plus  <dig> nas out of  <dig> proteins and 41– <dig> edges 




first, we needed to apply the gene expression barcode analysis to the gene products present in the notch pathway-network  to identify which nodes were active in these cell types. the quantitative results of these analyses are presented in fig.  <dig>  using the treshold of  <dig>  for the normalized expression, the b cell network expressed  <dig> of  <dig> of the notch pathway proteins. in contrast, the t cell network expressed 22– <dig> of the notch proteins. it was very interesting to show that in all lymphocytes dll1/2/ <dig> and jag1/ <dig> were absent . in fact, these proteins are ligands of the notch receptors of lymphocytes coming from the external cells that connect to them, therefore they should not be present in the lymphocytes. this is clearly shown in the quantitative analysis , since all these genes were labeled off  in b cells and in t cells.fig.  <dig> results of the analysis performed for the notch signaling pathway  with path2enet based on the gene expression barcode algorithm for the data sets of b cell cd19+, t cell cd4+ and t cell cd8+. the data sets correspond to  <dig> samples of expression microarrays. the treshold to indicate if a gene was expressed  or  is  <dig> . genes labeled with na are not present in the expression platform and thus could not be annotated




we also observed that the only notch paralogs detected in the lymphocytes were notch <dig> and some notch <dig>  it is well known that notch <dig> is preferentially expressed in mature naive b cells and interacts with dtx <dig>  thus playing an important role in b cell development  <cit> . we also saw that the level of dtx <dig> in b cells was much higher  than in t cells cd4+  or cd8+  . this result is also in agreement with several studies that have shown that t cells are normally developed in absence of dtx <dig>  <cit> .

finally, another differential protein found expressed in b cells but not in t cells was the transcription factor hes <dig>  the presence and role of this transcription factor in lymphocytes has been proven in several studies  <cit> . in fact, it has been indicated that in t cells hes <dig> is dispensable beyond the beta selection checkpoint  <cit> . this explains our detection of hes <dig> in b cells cd19+ and its abscence in t cells cd4+ and cd8 + .

as a whole the data presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> were very consistent with our current knowledge of the role of the notch pathway in human b and t lymphocytes, enhancing the value of generating well defined “pathway-expression-networks” for specific cell types which is the scope of path2enet.

path2enet tool for pathways: usability and formats
kegg pathways database  provides kgml files for each biological pathway on its website. for example, in the case of the human notch signaling pathway  the kgml file can be downloaded freely as “hsa <dig> xml”. the link for this file is: http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/download?entry=hsa04330&format=kgml. in this way, any specific pathway is accessible via its kgml file in the kegg website and path2enet r package provides functions to download these files and create a mysql database derived from the kgmls . moreover, to facilitate the use of the pathway kmgl files within the application path2enet, we also provided an sql dump file  generated with all the kmgl files of homo sapiens . this allows the creation of the necessary sql database within the user’s computer to query for specific pathways and to use the other functions of path2enet. this database resource is not just a compendium of kmgl files from kegg given that it provides some important added values:  it includes a mapping of all the gene and protein identifiers  from kegg to the ids of uniprotkb ;  it includes a relational sql structure, based on the extracted data from the pathways, that allocates such information in two principal indexed tables: one describing the pair-wise links or relations between protein pairs, and another one describing the characteristics of each singular protein.

with respect to the use of other formats, other than xml and kgml, path2enet can also use any database or resource provided in a “network structure” as an igraph object, because the tool includes functions to read and load in r igraph objects. for the use of other standard formats, such as sbml or biopax, there are already tools that address this scope. for example keggtranslator  <cit> , an easy-to-use stand-alone application that can visualize and convert kgml formatted xml-files into multiple output formats. this tool supports a plethora of output formats, being able to increase the information in translated documents beyond the scope of the kgml document. keggtranslator converts kegg files  to sbml, biopax, sif, sbgn, sbml-qual, gml, graphml and latex. moreover, in bioconductor  there are packages to parse, modify and visualize biopax data, like rbiopaxparser  <cit>  or paxtoolsr  <cit> . at the moment, we are working on a workflow to use these packages to create sql databases, similiar to the sql described above, but using data from other pathway resources such as reactome or pathway commons. this work is under development, but one of main problems in the use of these resources is not the use of standard formats, like biopax or sbml, but the accurate mapping to standard protein identifiers from uniprotkb.

CONCLUSIONS

path2enet produces pathway-expression-networks reading and integrating high quality pathway data, protein interaction data and expression cell specific data. the development of this type of tools can be very useful to achieve a more integrative and global view of the links and association between the proteins working in specific cellular systems. the tool is not restricted to predefined pathways since it can create large networks blending multiple layers of biological information. moreover, the tool can use either pre-processed expression data from selected repositories or experimental expression data from rna-seq or microarrays.

in this study we applied path2enet to the analysis of the notch signaling pathway in b cells and t cells. we showed that the expression networks based on a large microarray data set of these samples are different for each cell type, modulating the original general view of the canonical pathway provided by kegg. moreover, the observed differences have clear biological meaning, as demonstrated, for example, when only  <dig> out of the  <dig> notch paralog proteins  were expressed in b cells and t cells. thus, a clear signal in all lymphocytes was observed for notch2; while notch <dig> was also detected in b cells cd19+ and in t cells cd4+. we also found that key regulators like dtx <dig> and hes <dig> are strongly expressed in b cells and less expressed, or not present, in t cells. all these results give support to the the value of the networks that path2enet generates that are cell-type and context specific. in conclusion, users have the possibility to combine several pathways and include protein-protein interaction data to find key players in a specific biological context either for normal or for pathological samples.
