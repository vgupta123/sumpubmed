BACKGROUND
heteromorphic sex chromosomes  can often be distinguished from autosomes by the absence of recombination in at least a part of their length and y/w chromosome degeneration  <cit> . plants with sex chromosomes have evolved rarely but repeatedly in many plant lineages, and sex chromosomes have reached various levels of differentiation  <cit> . in asparagus officinalis and carica papaya for example, x and y chromosomes have diverged little and recombine along most of their length  <cit>  whereas in rumex acetosa and silene latifolia, the sex chromosomes in males are largely non-recombining  <cit> . in s. latifolia, x and y chromosomes can recombine only in the regions known as pseudoautosomal regions . westergaard  <cit>  originally identified one par on each of the q-arms of silene latifolia sex chromosomes. later, lengerova et al.   <cit>  using fluorescent in situ hybridization  revealed that the x par is located on the p-arm, whereas the par on the y chromosome is located on the q-arm. more recently, scotti and delph  <cit>  proposed that pars exist on both ends of the x and y chromosomes, similar to the situation in humans  <cit> . a further similarity to mammalian sex chromosomes is that the s. latifolia sex chromosomes diverged gradually  <cit> , which led to the formation of evolutionary strata. comparisons between the evolutionarily young s. latifolia sex chromosomes  and those of eutherian mammals  have revealed that similar processes are involved in the evolution of sex chromosomes in both animals and plants.

the sex chromosomes of s. latifolia most likely evolved from a single pair of autosomes as previously shown  <cit> , with one autosome of the gynodioecious relative s. vulgaris, a species lacking sex chromosomes, carrying homologues of s. latifolia sex-linked genes  <cit> . silene latifolia and s. vulgaris have the same haploid chromosome number , but differ substantially in genome size. the silene latifolia haploid genome is  <dig> mbp in females  <cit> , with the x chromosome being about  <dig> mbp in length  <cit> , whereas the haploid genome size of s. vulgaris is 1103mbp  <cit>  and autosomes are about  <dig> mbp long.

in this study we analyzed a part of the s. latifolia par located on the p-arm of the x chromosome and on the q-arm of the y chromosome  and of the corresponding s. vulgaris autosome, in order to study collinearity and divergence between these chromosome parts and to assess whether the s. latifolia par has characteristics in common with animal pars. furthermore, we investigate whether the s. latifolia size increase relative to s. vulgaris reflects the increase in size of the entire x chromosome or more closely resembles the increase seen in s. latifolia autosomes.

in mammalian genomes, pars have several interesting properties including increased gc content, higher mutation rates and a level of recombination higher than in the rest of the genome  <cit>  due to the necessity for crossing over in this region  <cit> . pars in mice and the human par <dig> appear to serve a critical function in spermatogenesis, as indicated by the fact that their absence prevents x and y chromosome segregation during male meiosis, causing male sterility  <cit> . however, pars differ widely in size among mammals , with most eutherians sharing the same genes situated closest to the telomere but having the pseudoautosomal boundary , separating the par from the sex-specific part of the sex chromosomes, at variable positions  <cit> . in mice, the pab is located in the gene fxy. exons 1– <dig> are located in the x specific part, while exons 4– <dig> are located in the par  <cit> . the segment of this gene located in the par has a higher gc content than its x-specific portion  <cit> .

in order to analyze the s. latifolia par and the corresponding region on the s. vulgaris autosome, we first established and screened a bacterial artificial chromosome  library of s. latifolia with the marker scopa <dig> that has previously been found to be located in the par of the closely related dioecious species s. dioica <cit>  and has successfully been identified and used for mapping s. latifolia sex chromosomes  <cit> . the marker scopa <dig> is located in the s. latifolia par which is known to recombine once per generation in males  <cit>  and makes up about 10 % of the y chromosome  <cit> . in s. vulgaris, the marker opa is lacking. we therefore first sequenced a clone of the s. latifolia bac library containing the marker scopa <dig>  sequencing was performed by sanger and  <dig> pyrosequencing to explore the suitability of different sequencing strategies for bac assembly. from these sequences we identified new markers and used them to screen the s. vulgaris bac library for a homologous clone. both bac sequences were assembled into > <dig>  bp-long scaffolds using gs de novo assembler .

here we present the results of a genomic comparison between an area located in the par of the x chromosome p-arm and in the q-arm of the y chromosome of the dioecious plant species s. latifolia and its homologous autosomal area in the closely related gynodioecious species s. vulgaris. our results identify the first physically mapped genes located in the silene par and reveal characteristics of a plant pseudoautosomal region.

RESULTS
our study reports the first comparative analysis of a bac sequence from a plant pseudoautosomal region and the corresponding autosomal area in a related species that lacks sex chromosomes. comparative mapping of a limited number of sex-linked genes in s. latifolia and autosomal genes in s. vulgaris has previously demonstrated large-scale synteny between the x chromosome of s. latifolia and one s. vulgaris autosome  <cit> . our results provide the first evidence for small-scale synteny and strong collinearity at the gene level within a restricted region of the s. latifolia sex-chromosomes, the par located in the p-arm of the x chromosome and in the q-arm of the y chromosome, and the corresponding s. vulgaris autosomes.

bac sequencing, assembly and annotation
the  <dig> paired-end sequencing of both a s. latifolia bac clones containing marker scopa <dig> and of a homologous bac clone from s. vulgaris gave more than  <dig>  reads for each bac clone. these were assembled into  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp-long scaffolds for s. latifolia and s. vulgaris, respectively.

we found a total of twenty-eight homologous sequences  with the a. thaliana proteome. of these, nine were found in both silene species, two were identified only in s. vulgaris , and six were found only in s. latifolia. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> sequences are most likely transposable or repeated elements as indicated by their annotations extracted from the protein domain family database prodom  <cit>  and repeat coverage . the repeat coverage is based on blast hits with a silene repeated elements library  <cit> .

athe sequence has been found twice in the bac clone.

putative transposable elements were identified by blastx searches against the arabidopsis thaliana proteome  with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  prodom annotations and coverage analysis with the silene repeated sequences database  <cit> .

among the nine sequences shared by the two silene species, the areas matching tair accessions at4g <dig> , at2g <dig>  at1g <dig> and atmg <dig> contain repeated elements. moreover, in s. vulgaris, the part matching atmg <dig> is contained in a match with the transposon sequence q3i6j4_silla, which also includes the sequence matching accession number at3g <dig> . using annotated silene transposable elements  <cit>  we found that the region matching crk <dig> is similar to a copia-like retrotransposon  <cit> , and that the region matching q3i6j4_silla is similar to a retand-like retrotransposon  for description  <cit> ). moreover, the sequences matching at2g <dig>  at1g <dig> and crk <dig> are found in both scaffolds at different positions, which provide further evidence that these sequences are transposable elements.

the five remaining sequences correspond to new pseudoautosomal genes. they are homologues of the a. thaliana genes esp <dig> , bip <dig> , acbp <dig> , and of genes at5g <dig> and at5g <dig>  these latter two genes we named par <dig> and par <dig>  respectively .

% identity with a. thaliana sequence is given first for s. latifolia and then for s. vulgaris. * par <dig> is truncated approximately by half in s. latifolia.

putative genes were identified using blastx searches against the arabidopsis thaliana proteome  with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  prodom annotations were used to determine putative function or detect repeats and transposable elements.

finally, two other gene sequences, at3g <dig> and at4g <dig>  that we named par <dig> and sva <dig>  were found on the bacs of s. latifolia and s. vulgaris, respectively . however, because the bac sequences only partly overlap, we do not have the homologous copies of these genes in the other species. the par <dig> gene in s. latifolia corresponds to a putative pseudoautosomal gene. the s. vulgaris sva <dig> sequence is homologous to a gene coding for a rhodanese protein in a. thaliana .

genes located in pars close to the pab  often present sex-specific expression  <cit> . using rna-seq data from muyle et al. <cit>  we found no evidence for sex-biased expression of the genes located in the s. latifolia par .

gc content
in mammalian pars, high recombination associated with biased gene conversion   <cit>  results in a high gc content  <cit> . comparisons of gc and gc <dig> content between the par and non-par regions of the human x chromosome revealed a higher gc and gc <dig> content in the pseudoautosomal region  <cit> . further studies of the human par revealed that the gc content decreases from 64 % close to the telomeric region to 55 % in the middle of the par and is only 38 % close to the pseudoautosomal boundary   <cit> . similar declines of the gc content were also found in other mammals, including cattle  <cit>  and murine species  <cit> .

a recent analysis of sequence polymorphisms in plants has revealed that the mating system affects gc content, with a higher content in outcrossing compared to selfing taxa being observed, but this effect is significant only in poaceae that are known to have unusual gc contents  <cit> . whether this effect is due to bgc and why it is observed only in poaceae, however, is not clear. to date, evidence for bgc in plant sex chromosomes is lacking, but given the relatively small size of the investigated par  in s. latifolia, which is comparable to par size in mammals, and the fact that recombination occurs during meiosis, a higher recombination rate is expected in this region as compared with other regions of the genome.

in contrast to mammals, the silene latifolia par can directly be compared with a homologous autosomal region in a closely related species. if the s. latifolia par has an increased gc content compared to autosomes, then this should be detectable in a comparative analysis. we then determined the gc and gc <dig> contents for each gene . a comparison between s. latifolia and s. vulgaris revealed no significant difference . moreover we determined the gc and the gc <dig> content of nine sex-linked genes that had previously been identified and are located in the sex-specific region of the x chromosome  <cit>  . no difference was found in the gc and gc <dig> content between the newly identified par genes and the genes located in the sex-specific region of the x chromosome . these results indicate that the pattern typical for mammalian pars is not present in the investigated part of the s. latifolia par. this may indicate that the s. latifolia par maintains its “autosomal” features, as the sex chromosomes in this species are evolutionarily young. alternatively, the studied region of the s. latifolia par might be close to the pseudoautosomal boundary where the gc content is lower than in more distal par areas, as has been found to be the case in most mammals  <cit> . indeed, the scopa <dig> marker was estimated to be located 15 cm from the pseudoautosomal boundary  in s. dioica <cit> . we obtained a very similar estimate of 11 cm for s. latifolia in this study . even though we presently do not know the physical distance between the pab and the bac clone studied here, the results of our genetic analysis clearly show that all genes identified in this study are located in the par, as evidenced by their cosegregation with marker scopa <dig> . furthermore, these genes are recombining with the same recombination frequency of 11 % with the pab .

*exon and intron sequences were taken into account.

gc and gc <dig> contents were computed on gene sequences of identical size in both s. latifolia and s. vulgaris. par <dig> is truncated in the bac sequence of s. latifolia and esp <dig> is truncated in s. vulgaris. in these cases, only partial sequences with coverage in both species were compared.

structure comparison
large-scale collinearity between the s. latifolia x chromosome and s. vulgaris autosome has repeatedly been reported in studies of s. latifolia sex chromosome evolution  <cit> . in addition to large-scale collinearity we here report the presence of small-scale collinearity spanning five genes whose linear arrangement is conserved. we also show that the length of these genes is identical between the studied silene species. indeed, while we assessed whether the investigated s. latifolia par presents signs of chromosome enlargement, because the x chromosome is about four times the size of a s. vulgaris autosome, we analyzed exon and intron lengths of the five genes previously reported . we then compared with a student’s t-test whether the average size of both introns and exons of the different genes between both species were similar and we found no significant difference between s. latifolia and s. vulgaris . the conserved intron size may indicate a functional role in gene regulation. indeed, introns enlarged by repetitive elements were found to affect gene expression in rice  <cit> . however, substantial differences in length occur in intergenic regions due to transposable element insertions. figure  <dig> presents the global alignment of both bac sequences. intergenic regions are highly diverged in size and consequently major gaps are visible in the alignment. we considered as intergenic all regions in-between the five genes described in this paper for which there are copies in both silene species. the total length of the intergenic region in the s. latifolia bac is  <dig>  bp, and  <dig>  bp in the s. vulgaris bac. this difference of  <dig>  bp is highly significant  and corresponds to a 61 % increase of the s. latifolia chromosome size as compared to s. vulgaris. this increase is due to the insertion of transposable elements in the s. latifolia par region.

genes par <dig> and esp <dig> are truncated in s. latifolia and s. vulgaris respectively, due to their positions at the end of the investigated bac clones. for these genes, only the fragment covered in both species was reported below.

microsatellite comparison
we found  <dig> and  <dig> microsatellite loci in s. latifolia and s. vulgaris respectively. a comparison of the average proportion of microsatellite loci  between both silene species using a student’s t-test revealed no significant difference . a previous analysis of microsatellites in plants revealed a negative correlation between microsatellite frequency and genome size  <cit> . the silene latifolia x chromosome is about four times larger than the s. vulgaris autosome. however, our results revealed that the s. latifolia par contains a similar density of microsatellite repeats as the s. vulgaris autosomes, suggesting that microsatellites play no or only a minor role in the size increase of the silene latifolia par. then, we searched for long-mer microsatellite accumulation in s. latifolia and s. vulgaris , which are expected to be rare in the par  <cit> . we found one  <dig> microsatellite locus in s. latifolia and one occurrence each of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in s. vulgaris. the low density of long-mer microsatellites observed here confirms the previously reported paucity of microsatellite repeats on the s. latifolia x chromosome par  <cit> .

transposable element insertion
we found three transposable elements containing long terminal repeats  in s. latifolia and two in s. vulgaris. the estimates of the invasion of these elements vary from about  <dig>  years ago to  <dig>  years ago . these elements were inserted after the divergence of the silene sex chromosomes approximately 5 ~  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , which may be an indication of highly active transposable elements in the par. however, given that we have observed a smaller than expected size increase in the par , we hypothesize that the enlargement of the x chromosome occurs mainly in the non-par areas of the x chromosome and is due to large-scale accumulation of different tandem repeats  <cit>  and retrotransposons  <cit> . the observed larger size of the studied s. latifolia par segment in comparison to the s. vulgaris autosome is close to the approximate difference in size between autosomes in s. latifolia and s. vulgaris and may therefore not reflect the size increase seen in the sex chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present the first analysis of a fragment belonging to the s. latifolia pseudoautosomal region located in the p-arm of the x chromosome and the q-arm of the y chromosome. the analysis of bac sequences revealed five new pseudoautosomal genes that are conserved in size and linear arrangement between s. latifolia and s. vulgaris, indicating small-scale gene collinearity between the x chromosome and the corresponding autosomal region. no increase in gc or gc <dig> content was found in the studied par area, indicating that either the evolutionarily young s. latifolia par is not gc rich or alternatively, that the studied region is close to the pseudoautosomal boundary, where no increase in gc content is expected. a structural comparison revealed that non-coding regions of the s. latifolia par contain multiple transposable and repeated elements and are overall about 61 % longer than in s. vulgaris. this size increase is similar to the size difference between s. latifolia and s. vulgaris autosomes and may therefore reflect a genome-wide, rather than a sex chromosome-specific trend. our study reports the first comparative analysis of a partial pseudoautosomal region in a plant which we compare to a closely related species lacking sex chromosomes, thereby providing new insights into genome size and sex chromosome evolution in silene latifolia.
