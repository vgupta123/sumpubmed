BACKGROUND
bauhinia l.  is a pantropical legume genus with ca.150— <dig> species, the number of which depends on the demarcation of the genus
 <cit>  . the taxonomy of bauhinia is especially complicated, and it has been recognized either as a large genus
 <cit> , or as 8- <dig> distinct genera
 <cit>  . although a taxonomical consensus has not been achieved, recent studies on pollen morphology and molecular systematics of bauhinia have suggested that bauhinia sensu lato is not monophyletic and should be subdivided into bauhinia sensu stricto and other independent genera
 <cit>  . bauhinia is well known for its ornamental shrubs and trees, such as b. blakeana dunn being first chosen as the city flower of hong kong, china in  <dig>  in addition, seeds of b. petersiana bolle are used as a coffee substitute
 <cit> ; some species, e.g., b. championii  benth., b. purpurea l., b. tomentosa l., have local pharmacological uses
 <cit> .

bauhinia was named after two swiss botanists, the brothers jean bauhin  and gaspard bauhin , suggesting a brotherly relationship in its commonly bilobate leaves
 <cit> . bauhinia, along with a northern temperate genus cercis l. and several tropical genera, bear bilobate, bifoliolate, or sometimes unifoliolate leaves, which constitute the tribe cercideae bronn as sister to the remaining legumes in the molecular phylogenetic trees
 <cit> . bilobate, bifoliolate, or unifoliolate pulvinate leaves with basal actinodromous or acrodromous venations are characteristic for cercideae
 <cit> , whereas leaves of other legumes are usually pinnately compound, occasionally trifoliolate or palmate . hence, well-preserved bilobate, bifoliolate, or unifoliolate pulvinate leaves are easily recognizable in the fossil record and can provide an instrumental evidence for understanding the early evolution and biogeographic history of the cercideae and the leguminosae.

the goals of this paper are to  investigate and evaluate the fossil record of bauhinia, with special reference to that of cercis, by comparing both extinct and extant angiosperms with the similar lobed leaf forms,  describe the foliage and fruit fossils from the oligocene ningming formation of guangxi, south china, and discuss their biogeographic implications.

methods
macrofossils
the fossil foliage and fruits studied in this paper were collected from the ningming formation at 22° <dig> ’n, 107° <dig> ’e in the western region of ningming county, guangxi zhuang autonomous region, south china . the ningming formation is primarily shallow lacustrine deposits consisting of gray to dark gray mudstone, light yellow shaly siltstone, and finely grained sandstone. no volcanic rocks and mammals are hitherto found in the ningming formation
 <cit> , and an absolute age for this formation is therefore unavailable. the ningming basin is among the late palaeogene basins 
 <cit>  in southern guangxi and northern vietnam that experienced a generally similar geological history, so it is inferred that the ningming formation is likely to be late eocene—oligocene in age. the previous studies on plant macrofossils , sporo-pollen assemblages  potonié), and fishes  from the same locality indicate the ningming formation most possibly an oligocene age
 <cit> , which is adopted in this paper.

in china, all the land belongs to our country. our fossil-collecting fieldwork was done in non-national nature reserves  and non-private areas and has been allowed by the local government. we did not violate the chinese fossil collection and mining laws and management regulations.

the macrofossils are preserved as compressions/impressions only with a little organic material remaining in mudstone. cuticle preparations were unsuccessful because organic material has been greatly weathered. all the marcofossil specimens used herein are deposited at natural history museum of guangxi , nanning, p.r. china .

terminology
terms used in the specimen descriptions for leaves and fruits follow ellis et al.
 <cit> . as for the foliage of the cercideae, the lower pulvinus has been interpreted as a primary pulvinus at the base of the leaf while the upper pulvinus as a secondary pulvinus homologous with the pulvinus on the leaflet petiolule, consisting of an apical common joint with two distal laminar joints, one for each half of the lamina
 <cit> . anatomically, laminar joints are resulted from the tertiary pulvini at the base of each primary vein
 <cit> . van der pijl
 <cit>  classified the leaves of bauhinia into three basic types: unifoliolate, bilobate, and bifoliolate. cusset
 <cit>  subdivided the leaves of the tribe bauhinieae benth. into seven types, but unifoliolate, bilobate, and bifoliolate types epitomize in the foliage of living and fossil species of bauhinia. hence, unifoliolate, bilobate, and bifoliolate leaves are adopted herein for the description of bauhinia foliage. time calibrations refer to the latest geologic time scale
 <cit> . the global palaeogeographic maps for the late cretaceous, palaeocene, eocene, and oligocene were browsed
 <cit> .

comparative morphology
both fossil and extant taxa bearing similar unifolioate, bilobate, and bifoliolate leaves in leguminosae and other families  were compared to evaluate the fossil record and biogeographic history of bauhinia. based upon an extensive review on the literature and specimens of previously reported bauhinia and other similar foliage from the cretaceous and cenozoic, we summarized the reliable fossil record of bauhinia .

figures
photographs of specimens were taken with digital cameras . a simplified phylogenetic tree  of the cercideae within leguminosae was partially adapted from the literature
 <cit> , with the iconic leaf forms enhanced. a map for the fossil locality  was partially adapted from the literature
 <cit> . line drawings of leaf specimens for fossil and living taxa as well as of distributional map of bauhinia were drawn  and arranged using coreldraw  <dig>   and adobe photoshop  <dig>   programmes.

 <cit> .

RESULTS
similar leaf architectural comparisons
a leaf lamina partially or fully divided into two lobes is not very common but remarkable among angiosperms. such leaf forms can be traced back to the late cretaceous, for example extinct liriodendron-like angiosperms liriodendrites bradacii k.r. johnson
 <cit>  and liriophyllum kansense dilcher et p.r. crane
 <cit>  , but some of them have been erroneously identified as bauhinia fossils . overall, both extinct and extant taxa bearing bilobate and bifoliolate foliage occur in leguminosae, apocynaceae juss., convolvulaceae juss., liriodendraceae sensu m.s. romanov et dilcher, oxalidaceae bercht. et j. presl, passifloraceae juss. ex roussel, proteaceae juss., and zygophyllaceae r. br.. in order to determine the reliable fossils of bauhinia, comparisons are made among both extinct and extant taxa with similar lobed leaf forms .

the taxonomy of bauhinia l
the systematics of living bauhinia l. is primarily based upon growth habit, inflorescence, flower, calyx, hypanthium, petal, fertile stamen number, stamen filament, gynophore, stigma, pollen, fruit, seed, and leaf morphology
 <cit> , as well as molecular data
 <cit> . species of bauhinia sensu stricto are usually trees or shrubs, rarely semi-scandent plants, whereas those of lysiphyllum  de wit, schnella raddi, tylosema  torre et hillc., and phanera lour.  are lianas, herbaceous vines or rarely shrubs. different character combinations in reproductive and vegetative organs have been used to classify bauhinia sensu lato into bauhinia sensu stricto and other 7- <dig> genera, with reference to the molecular phylogenetics of cercideae
 <cit>  . bauhinia sensu stricto as one of the first branching lineages is the only pantropical genus in the subtribe bauhiniinae  walp. of cercideae, so it may boast an earlier origin and evolutionary history than other relatives within the bauhiniinae.

morphological characters are the features that ultimately support the distinctiveness of real biological entities, so integral studies mutually illuminating between morphology and molecular systematics will be key in the discrimination of elusive relationships within bauhinia sensu lato. however, considerable convergence, parallelism or evolutionary conservativeness in the organs  of bauhinia sensu stricto and its relatives often place palaeobotanists in a predicament. without reproductive organs , bilobate leaves of some species in bauhinia sensu stricto, phanera, and schnella would not be distinguished from each other even by neobotanists. hence, bilobate or bifoliolate leaf fossils in cercideae were often assigned to bauhinia sensu lato .

the fossil record of bauhinia and other bilobate leafed taxa
overall, bauhinia bears mostly bilobate, bifoliolate, or sometimes unifoliolate leaves having characteristic upper and lower pulvini, basal actinodromous or acrodromous primary veins , brochidodromous, eucamptodromous or craspedodromous secondary veins, and alternate or opposite percurrent tertiary veins, character combinations of which are noticeably different from the lobed foliage of genera in the tribe detarieae sensu lato polhill of leguminosae, as well as in apocynaceae, convolvulaceae, liriodendraceae, oxalidaceae, passifloraceae, proteaceae juss., and zygophyllaceae . the simple, unlobed leaves of bauhinia also differ from those of cercis in the tribe cercideae in the former usually bearing fewer and weaker secondary veins along the distal third of the midvein and a mucro or spine at the leaf tip
 <cit> . based upon an extensive review on the previously reported bauhinia and other similar foliage from the cretaceous and cenozoic, those pre-oligocene reports regarding bauhinia across the world are either questionable or have been rejected . besides the reliable fossils from ningming of china, foliage and/or wood of bauhinia have been described from the miocene-pliocene of thailand, india, nepal, uganda, and ecuador.

comparisons
this fossil species b. larsenii was first described by chen and zhang
 <cit>  on the basis of four specimens. here, we emended this species, especially regarding the leaf architecture and fruit morphology, based upon the type specimens and newly collected materials. it is very similar to living b. viridescens desv. and b. brachycarpa wall. ex benth.
 <cit>  in bearing shallowly or moderately bilobate leaves, brochidodromous secondary vein, and elliptic fruits . however, no adequate characters guarantee the fossils to belong to any living species. in addition, b. larsenii is different from b. cheniae sp. nov. and other fossil species
 <cit>  in the leaf architectural detail . in particular, b. larsenii represents the first recognition of bauhinia fruit and foliage organically connected in the fossil record.

discussion
the leguminosae is the third largest angiosperm family only after orchidaceae juss. and asteraceae bercht. et j. presl, varying in habit from herbs to shrubs, vines, lianas, and trees, with an extremely high diversity of ca.  <dig> living genera and ca.  <dig>  species
 <cit>  across different habitats of the world. meanwhile, this family has an abundant and diverse fossil record, and its characteristic fruits, flowers, pollen, foliage, and wood have been well recognized from numerous cenozoic localities around the world
 <cit> . however, an outstanding incongruence between the palaeobotanical finds and molecular systematics of legumes is that the earliest fossil record of the tribe cercideae as sister to all other lineages in the molecular phylogenetic trees of leguminosae
 <cit>  has so far occurred later than that of some derived tribes bearing compound leaves such as sophoreae spreng. ex dc. in the subfamily papilionoideae l. ex dc.
 <cit> . such an incongruence implies that the extant cercideae bearing the simple, entire or bilobate to bifoliolate foliage is unlikely to be the most primitive in leguminosae, but the derived as some authors formerly suggested from an extinct legume ancestor possibly with palmately compound leaves
 <cit>  or pinnately compound leaves
 <cit> . the fossil record of the cercideae lacking or being fewer than those derived tribes in the early palaeogene of middle latitudes is because either the early distribution of the cercideae might be restricted to low latitudes, or palaeobotanical studies on the coeval legumes from low latitudes are relatively inadequate
 <cit> . hence, the cercideae fossils, especially from low latitudes, can provide an historical perspective for their early evolution, adaptive radiation, and biogeographic history.

leaves of cercis have been reported from late cretaceous and cenozoic sediments, but the overwhelming majority of these reports have been rejected, questioned, revised
 <cit> , or in need of confirmation by reinvestigation of the original materials and discovery of better preserved materials
 <cit>  . the oldest reliable fossils of cercis are represented by the foliage and/or fruits  from the late eocene florissant formation, colorado and john day formation, oregon, western usa
 <cit> . in contrast, the foliage fossils of bauhinia have been previously reported from the late cretaceous and palaeogene of north america and eurasia
 <cit> , but these identifications are erroneous or unreliable
 <cit>  . although bauhinia or bauhinia-like bilobate foliage have been recently reported from the middle eocene of tanzania
 <cit> , the late eocene of vietnam
 <cit> , the late eocene-early miocene of brazil
 <cit> , and possibly the latest oligocene–mid-late miocene of australia
 <cit> , the preservation of these pre-miocene fossils, which are observed from the originally published figures, appears too poor to reliably assign these leaf fossils to either bauhinia or even cercideae, because neither the pulvinus nor basal actinodromous or acrodromous venations can be confirmed . instead, the oldest reliable evidence of bauhinia and bauhinia-like foliage are provided from the oligocene ningming formation, guangxi, south china  and coatzingo formation, puebla, mexico . by the miocene–pliocene, various species of bauhinia have existed in thailand, india, nepal, uganda, and ecuador  while those of cercis have become widespread in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere
 <cit> .

in addition, some other unifoliolate or bilobate foliage or fruit fossils from the oligocene—miocene of jinggu , zhangpu , and ningming  in south china have been reliably described
 <cit>  or preliminarily identified as cercis and bauhinia . also, the bilobate foliage extremely similar to bauhinia has been discovered from the eocene - oligocene coals of west sumatra, western indonesia . hence, more cercideae fossil will be studied and reported from low-latitude tropical zone
 <cit>  of east and southeast asia. recently, a strictly east-to-west vicariance for the historical biogeography of cercis has been postulated by molecular data
 <cit> . the cercideae macrofossils occurring in the eocene to oligocene of mid-low latitudes and apparently lacking in the coeval sediments at high-latitudes appear to partially support a tropical tethys seaway origin and spread
 <cit>  or an “out-of-tropical asia” dispersal
 <cit>  of the cercideae and the leguminosae as formerly hypothesized by some authors. however, detailed historical biogeography of cercideae still need more palaeobotanical and molecular dataset.

CONCLUSIONS
bauhinia has exhibited a certain diversity with three species  bearing bifoliolate or bilobate leaves in a low-latitude locality—ningming since at least the oligocene, implying the tropical zone of south china may represent one of the centres for early diversification of the genus. the reliable macrofossils of bauhinia and cercis have made their debut in the eocene—oligocene floras from mid-low latitudes and appeared to lack in the coeval floras at high latitudes. by the miocene–pliocene, various species of bauhinia have existed in thailand, india, nepal, uganda, and ecuador while those of cercis have become widespread in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. such a biogeographic pattern implies a possible tethys seaway origin and spread for legumes. however, detailed scenarios for the historical biogeography of bauhinia and its relatives still need more robust dataset from palaeobotany and molecular phylogeny in future research.
