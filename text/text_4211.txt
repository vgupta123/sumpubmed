BACKGROUND
burkholderia mallei is the causative agent of glanders, a serious gram-negative infection that predominantly affects horses and other equines  <cit> . natural b. mallei infection has largely been eradicated and human infection is extremely rare, but renewed interest in this organism parallels its classification as a category b biothreat agent. there is a need to develop an effective vaccine for individuals at risk of exposure from deliberate release, and understanding the immune response elicited during infection with b. mallei is central to this process. the relative importance of cellular versus humoral responses in the development of protective immunity against b. mallei is under investigation. experimental evidence indicates that both play a role, but that stimulation of a th1-like immune response may be important for protection  <cit> . one study of murine monoclonal antibodies  against b. mallei administered to mice prior to a lethal aerosol challenge reported non-sterilizing protection  <cit> . passive protection in the mouse model has also been described for the highly related b. pseudomallei using murine mabs specific for b. pseudomallei polysaccharide  <cit> .

the development of improved diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of glanders is also a necessity. pcr has been described for the detection of b. mallei during acute presentation  <cit> , but the antibody response to infection is poorly understood and there are no serological tests currently recommended for the diagnosis of glanders in patients who have been partially or fully treated and in whom b. mallei is not detectable. humoral immune response profiling to infection is a logical approach to the evaluation of immunogenic antigens, and has the ability to define novel targets for both diagnostics and vaccines. profiling using proteome microarrays has been described for a vaccinia virus proteome consisting of  <dig> individual viral proteins and used to determine ab profiles in serum from vaccinia virus-immunized humans, primates, and mice  <cit> . this technology has not been described in the literature to date for antibody profiling in response to infection with b. mallei or b. pseudomallei, although polysaccharide microarray technology has been described for the detection of b. pseudomallei and b. mallei antibodies to capsular antibodies  <cit> . an alternative strategy for immunoscreening is the use of a bacteriophage expression library. this has recently been used to detect in vivo expressed antigens of staphylococcus aureus and to utilize this information to develop a vaccine to protect against experimental nasal carriage  <cit> . although complex molecules such as lps will not be represented, this technique offers an immediately available, rapid and simple means of identifying and testing putative candidate vaccines and targets for serological diagnostic tests. we have applied bacteriophage-mediated immunoscreening to identify antibody responses to in vivo expressed genes during experimental equine glanders infection, and have compared this with those elicited during human melioidosis.

RESULTS
b. mallei expression library screening with glanders serum
the b. mallei expression library was individually probed with sera from two experimentally infected horses taken seven days after intra-tracheal bacterial inoculation with b. mallei atcc  <dig>  this equine glanders model has been described previously  <cit> . positive plaques were picked and purified by additional rounds of screening. a total of  <dig> positive clones were identified and partially sequenced. these corresponded to  <dig> different loci  containing  <dig> known or putative protein coding sequences  of b. mallei. additional file  <dig> provides full details of the b. mallei antigens recognized by one or both of the infected horse sera. the distribution of loci was not equal between the two chromosomes;  <dig> loci were present on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> loci were present on chromosome  <dig> in b. mallei atcc  <dig> 

the specificity of these results for experimental glanders infection as opposed to the presence of pre-existing cross reactive antibodies to other bacterial species was tested by screening serum taken from one healthy experimental horse prior to infection with b. mallei. a total of  <dig> screenings failed to reveal any positive plaques . this strongly suggests that the antibodies detected in sera from the two infected horses are specific to the experimental b. mallei infection.

four loci were highly over-represented amongst the positive clones; these are shown in table  <dig>  these four loci together represented  <dig>  of all positive clones. the most frequent was locus number  <dig>  which was represented in  <dig> clones, followed by locus  <dig> , locus  <dig>  and locus  <dig> . this compares with the fifth most frequent locus, which occurred only  <dig> times . both horse sera recognized each of the four common loci. the specificity of this result was confirmed by western blot of one representative clone of each of the four loci .

the cdss in each of the four common loci were examined to identify the putative antigen responsible for immune stimulation. this was achieved by mapping overlapping clones at each locus. a complete or partial copy of bma <dig> was present in all clones of locus 10; the same was true for bma <dig> in locus  <dig>  bmaa <dig> for locus  <dig> and bmaa <dig> for locus  <dig>  furthermore, bma <dig> was the only gene present in  <dig> independent clones, bma <dig> was the only gene present in  <dig> clones, bmaa <dig> was present alone in  <dig> clones, and bmaa <dig> was present alone in  <dig> clones. based on these observations, we propose that these cdss encode immuno-stimulatory proteins during experimental equine infection. we cannot infer from this that all four genes were expressed during equine infection; the presence of highly homologous regions between the four proteins could lead to antibody cross-reactivity. furthermore, our results do not exclude the possibility that additional cdss encoding surface-expressed proteins present in the four commonly represented loci also contributed towards the antibody response. for example, bma <dig>  encodes a putative ompa family protein, and bmaa <dig>  encodes a putative outer membrane protein ompa/smpa/omla family.

b. mallei burkholderia hep_hag autotransporter  proteins
three of the four putatively immunodominant antigens were annotated as hemagglutinin family proteins, and the fourth was annotated as a putative outer membrane protein . the domain organization of these proteins was defined and compared using the pfam protein family database  <cit> . all four proteins contain a c-terminal yada domain , together with several him  and hep_hag  domains . the hep_hag domain is a repetitive region comprising a  <dig> amino acid repeat that is found in haemagglutinins and invasins. the him domain is another short motif  that is often found in conjunction with the hep_hag motif. the yada domain is composed of approximately  <dig> amino acids, and is found in the c-terminal regions of surface-exposed gram-negative bacterial proteins associated with autotransporters  <cit> . proteins containing the yada domain often have a characteristic functional organization, with an extended conserved n-terminal signal sequence  and a central region that often includes hep_hag and him domains. in addition to the conserved domains, these proteins contain variable domains, which are often composed of low complexity sequence that are not conserved between family members. the domain conservation of these proteins has led us to designate them as burkholderia hep_hag autotransporter  proteins.

to define further the immunodominant region of these proteins, mapping was carried out to define the minimum region present in all positive clones at each of the four loci. for bma <dig>  bma <dig> and bmaa <dig>  all of the clones contained hep_hag domains. for bmaa <dig> all but one of the clones contained hep_hag domains, the errant clone contained the first  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus. the hep_hag domain may therefore represent the minimum epitope required to stimulate an antibody response.

in silico analysis was conducted to define the presence of b. mallei buha proteins using the whole genome sequence of b. mallei atcc  <dig>  <cit> . six genes were identified, four of which were the cdss identified above . genes encoding the two non-immunogenic b. mallei buha proteins were examined. bmaa <dig> contained a c-terminal yada domain and a single him domain, but no hep_hag domains. the cds encoding this protein had an is element  located immediately upstream and lacked an n-terminal signal sequence. is element mediated recombination, a feature of the evolution of the b. mallei genome, appears to have resulted in the truncation of this cds; it is likely that this cds is a pseudogene. the other non-immunogenic member of this family is bmaa <dig>  this cds contains hep_hag and him domains , but lacks a strong pfam yada domain match in the c-terminus; a weaker match to the yada domain with a score below the pfam gathering threshold  was detected. this cds also lacked an n-terminal signal sequence, and it is likely that the product is not processed to the external surface of the cell. these observations could explain the failure to detect these two loci by immuno-screening.

six b. mallei isolates are currently undergoing whole genome sequencing by tigr  <cit> , and are publicly available via the pathema database  <cit> . alleles of all four immunodominant proteins were identified in strains  <dig>  fmn, jhu, and gb8; the number of residues in the encoded proteins was also comparable. strain gb <dig> is a horse passaged derivative of atcc  <dig>  and strains fmn and jhu are human passaged derivatives of atcc  <dig> isolated during the same infective episode. two of the strains, nctc  <dig> and nctc  <dig>  did not contain alleles of bma <dig>  additionally, both of these strains contained identical alleles of bmaa <dig>  which encoded proteins with additional internal residues  in comparison to the atcc  <dig> protein. nctc  <dig> was originally isolated in hungary in  <dig>  and nctc  <dig> was isolated in turkey in  <dig>  given their different origins, it is surprising that they both lack bma <dig> and have identical variants of bmaa <dig> 

the distribution of the four immunogenic b. mallei buha proteins was investigated in collections of b. mallei strains  using pcr. all isolates were positive for bma <dig> and bmaa <dig>  whilst bma <dig> and bmaa <dig> showed some variability: 12/ <dig>  of strains were positive for bma <dig> and 18/ <dig>  of strains were positive for bmaa <dig>  the screening was expanded to include a collection of b. pseudomallei strains . all isolates were positive for the b. pseudomallei homologs of bma <dig> and bmaa <dig>  while homologs of bma <dig> and bmaa <dig> were variable but more widely distributed; 96/ <dig>  and 92/ <dig>  of the strains were positive for bma <dig> and bmaa <dig>  respectively.

distribution of buha proteins
we hypothesized that the buha proteins are important virulence determinants in b. mallei and b. pseudomallei, and that these would not be present in the highly related but non-pathogenic b. thailandensis genome  <cit> . in silico analysis using the whole genome sequences of b. mallei atcc  <dig>  <cit> , b. pseudomallei k <dig>  <cit>  and b. thailandensis strain e <dig>  <cit>  was performed to identify orthologs of the b. mallei buha proteins.

the genome of b. pseudomallei k <dig> contained  <dig> genes encoding buha proteins . this included orthologs of all four b. mallei immunodominant proteins and the other two non-immunogenic proteins . with the exception of the b. pseudomallei proteins bpsl <dig> and bpss <dig>  all of the orthologs contained a similar number of amino acid residues and were of a similar size. in the case of bpsl <dig> and bpss <dig>  there were increased residues in the repeat regions of these cdss; bpsl <dig> contained an additional  <dig> amino acid residues that corresponded to  <dig> hep_hag domains ; and bpss <dig> contained an additional  <dig> amino acid residues in a low complexity region . the b. pseudomallei ortholog of bmaa <dig>  bpss <dig>  is not truncated and contains an n-terminal signal sequence, him domains, and a c-terminal yada domain, but does not contain hep_hag domains.

in addition to the orthologs of the b. mallei buha proteins, the b. pseudomallei genome contained three other related cdss: bpsl <dig>  bpss <dig> and bpss <dig>  all of these proteins contain him, hep_hag and yada domains; the yada domain matches for bpss <dig> and bpss <dig> are below the pfam gathering threshold .

the genome of b. thailandensis strain e <dig> contained  <dig> buha proteins :  <dig> with hep-hag and yada domains ;  <dig> protein with hep-hag domains but lacking a c-terminal domain ; and  <dig> gene remnant  of the b. mallei bmaa <dig> and b. pseudomallei bpss <dig> orthologs. only one of these proteins was orthologous to the b. mallei immunodominant proteins ; two were orthologous to the non-immunogenic proteins, two have b. pseudomallei orthologs, but not b. mallei orthologs, and one is unique to b. thailandensis.

the identification of numerous hemagglutinin family proteins in the three burkholderia genomes is in marked contrast to other bacterial species, including some other members of the burkholderiacae which have lower numbers. the phylogenetic relationship of this family of proteins was investigated by aligning the c-terminal yada domain regions. the repetitive distribution of hep_hag domains within proteins, and the variability and low complexity composition of other regions, renders whole protein comparisons unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis. the buha proteins from b. mallei, b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis and  <dig> other sequenced burkholderia species , were compared with buha proteins from other bacteria . the genomes of other burkholderiaceae contained varying number of buha proteins . the buha proteins from b. mallei and b. pseudomallei were represented in two lineages. the b. mallei protein bmaa <dig> clustered with orthologs from b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis  and a protein from burkholderia sp.  <dig>  and formed part of a larger cluster that was made up predominantly of proteins from outside the burkholderiaceae. the other buha proteins from b. mallei, b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis resided within a second cluster.

the orthogous relationships identified for the b. mallei and b. pseudomallei proteins using comparative genomic analysis were also evident in the phylogenetic tree . in addition, the tree topology suggested paralogous relationships for some of the buha proteins. for example, the orthologous pair b. pseudomallei protein bpss <dig> and b. mallei protein bmaa <dig> clustered with b. pseudomallei protein bpsl <dig>  bpsl <dig> resides in a genomic island   <cit>  on chromosome i and bpss <dig> resides on chromosome ii, but phylogenetic analysis of the yada domains suggests that the two loci arose from a duplication event. the conservation of hep_hag and him domains organization in these two proteins also suggests a common ancestry. on this basis, it is possible that mobile genetic elements may have had a role in the expansion of buha proteins in b. pseudomallei.

b. pseudomallei expression library screening with melioidosis patient serum
the finding that b. pseudomallei k <dig> contains  <dig> genes encoding buha proteins raised the possibility that these may also be immunogenic during human melioidosis. a b. pseudomallei k <dig> expression library was probed with twenty-one separate serum samples from patients presenting to sappasithiprasong hospital in northeast thailand with culture-proven melioidosis. patient age ranged from 10– <dig> years , and  <dig> were male. diabetes mellitus was present in  <dig> patients, a proportion that reflects the presence of this condition in the larger melioidosis population. manifestations of disease were highly variable, as follows:  <dig> patients had disseminated melioidosis ,  <dig> patients had bacteremia with a single or no identifiable focus of infection,  <dig> patients had multifocal infection , and  <dig> patients had localized disease .

a total of  <dig> clones, corresponding to  <dig> different loci  containing  <dig> known or putative open reading frames of b. pseudomallei were isolated. the buha proteins were uncommon;  <dig> of the putative b. pseudomallei buha proteins were present in either one , or two clones   of clones overall); the other members of the buha protein group were not observed. three of the four b. mallei homologs were each represented once.

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study indicate that the buha proteins generate a strong antibody response in the experimental equine model of glanders. bacteriophage-mediated immunoscreening demonstrated that four buha proteins were highly over-represented. comparative sequence analysis of the cloned inserts of these four loci identified the minimum regions present in all clones. for each protein the mapped regions contained hep_hag motifs. we propose that this domain represents the immunostimulatory region of these proteins; the presence of multiple hep_hag protein domains may indicate that there are multiple sites for immune recognition. in silico analysis of the b. mallei atcc  <dig> genome identified two further members of this protein family ; their absence in the library can be explained by the fact that these were predicted not to be expressed or processed correctly.

in addition to the hep_hag domain, the four b. mallei immunostimulatory buha proteins contain c-terminal yada trimeric autotransporter domains. this domain is found in a large family of surface proteins, and has been shown to be important in protein processing and transport. the yada domain inserts into the outer membrane forming a trimeric structure, which then translocates the passenger domains to the cell surface side of the membrane  <cit> . unlike other autotransporter proteins , the passenger domains of yada domain proteins are not cleaved and remain covalently linked to the translocator domain. stable trimerization has been shown to be essential for native folding and stability of the functional passenger domain  <cit> . several of the yada family proteins have been functionally characterized and shown to be adhesins that mediate bacterial interactions with host cells or extracellular matrix proteins  <cit> . the prototypical protein of this family is the yada adhesin from yersinia enterocolitica  <cit> . in addition to the c-terminal yada domain, the protein also contains  <dig> hep_hag domains and  <dig> him domain. yada has a trimeric head-stalk-anchor architecture  <cit> , with the hep_hag and him domains forming part of the head domain  <cit>  . this region of the protein has a left-handed parallel β-roll  structure, which has been shown to bind collagen  <cit> . in particular, residues within the hep_hag domain regions of yada have been shown to be essential for yada-mediated collagen binding  <cit> . epitope mapping of yada identified  <dig> epitopes that were uniquely recognized by an anti-yada antiserum that was able to inhibit collagen binding  <cit> . four of these epitopes shared a motif nsvaig-s that is repeated eight times within the n-terminal half of yada and forms part of the hep_hag motif.

the role of b. mallei immunostimulatory buha proteins is unknown, but the similarity in domain organisation to adhesins such as yada suggests they may function as cell surface binding proteins that potentially modulate host-cell interactions. the redundancy of proteins in the genomes, and the diversity of the proteins, suggests that they may have functionally distinct roles. although the hep_hag domain of the yada protein of y. enterocolitica has been shown to bind collagen, it is not known if any of the b. mallei proteins are able to bind this host molecule. further work is needed to characterize the functions and specificities of these proteins, and the role they play in the pathogenesis of b. mallei.

orthologues of all the b. mallei buha proteins were identified in the b. pseudomallei k <dig> genome, together with three further cdss . these additional cdss were in regions of the b. mallei atcc <dig> genome that appear to have been deleted in comparison to the b. pseudomalllei k <dig> genome  <cit> . however, this family of proteins was not strongly immunostimulatory during human melioidosis, despite evidence for expression in vivo as indicated by a small number of positive clones in the library. possible explanations for the difference in immunostimulatory capacity of b. mallei in horses and b. pseudomallei in humans includes variation in the nature of the immune response or other aspects of disease pathogenesis in the horse versus human host, and different rates of gene regulation and expression between the two bacterial species. it is also possible that protein folding and associated immunogenicity differs between the two bacterial species, although this seems less tenable given their degree of relatedness  <cit> .

the implications of these findings for vaccine development and diagnostics are currently uncertain. it is unclear whether the buha proteins are immunogenic during human b. mallei infection. given the relative lack of immune response to the buha proteins during human melioidosis, it seems unlikely that detection of antibodies to buha proteins will have diagnostic utility for this infection. although there are apparent differences in the immunostimulatory profiles of the hemaglutinin family proteins of b. mallei and b. pseudomallei in their respective disease model, both pathogens share an expanded number of these proteins in comparison to the non-pathogenic b. thailandensis. both b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis can be isolated from the soil. we speculate on the basis of a reduced number of hemaglutinin family proteins othologues in b. thailandensis that they may have a role in modulating host-cell interactions in b. pseudomallei. further studies will be required to investigate the in vivo expression of these proteins in the host, and the role they play in the pathology of melioidosis.
