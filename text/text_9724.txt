BACKGROUND
by definition, essential proteins of a cellular organism are necessary to live and replicate, and are therefore attractive targets for antimicrobial treatments. however, experimentally assaying the essentiality of their coding genes is error prone when done in high throughput. additionally, experimental screens are resource intensive and not feasible for all organisms, as typically, for each gene a knock-out strain needs to be constructed. besides this, pathogenic bacterial organisms are hazardous to cultivate and therefore need higher laboratorial efforts. the metabolism of a cell is substantial for maintaining life and growth, and hence metabolic enzymes have been successfully targeted by antibiotics inhibiting essential processes in bacterial genomes  <cit> .

several computational techniques have been developed to identify essential genes in silico. flux balance analyses  is widely used to assess the essentiality of genes  <cit> . however, fba approaches need clear definitions of nutrition availability and biomass production under specifically given environmental conditions  <cit> . descriptors for enzymes in the metabolic network were put up by graph theoretical approaches and were used to identify drug targets in micro-organisms. concepts of choke-points and load-points were successfully applied to estimate the essentiality of an enzyme  <cit> . the term 'damage' was used to assess enzymes that may serve as drug targets when their inhibition influences a substantial number of downstream reactions and products  <cit> . in a previous study, we examined the ability of the network to obtain the products of a knocked-out reaction from its educts via alternative pathways and used this method to detect potential drug targets for p. falciparum  <cit> . various descriptors for centrality of a node in a network have been successfully applied and supported detecting essential proteins in protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . it was shown that proteins which have a more central position evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival  <cit> . also sequence features like codon usage, gc-content and localization signals were used for predicting essential genes. they were successfully applied for inferring essential genes from s. cerevisiae to the less studied yeast strain s. mikatae  <cit> . additionally, phyletic retention has been found to be a valuable predictive feature for gene essentiality in e. coli and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . although protein-protein interaction networks may provide a global view of cellular signaling, we were rather interested in identifying drug targets in pathogens inferred from properties of mal-functional metabolism after having knocked out an enzymatic function.

in a previous study, we developed and applied an integrative machine learning method that combined these topology based methods to validate an experimental knock-out screen of escherichia coli  <cit> . we now used the basic concepts of this strategy to enable predicting essential genes in an organism for which no experimental training data is available. for defining the essentiality of a gene, we now integrated sequence characteristics such as codon usages, length of the sequences and phyletic retention. furthermore, we incorporated several centrality-descriptors for a node in a network. we used experimental datasets of comprehensive genome wide knock-out screens of escherichia coli  <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  to train the machines with a large variety of attributes including topology characteristics as mentioned above, own developments on evaluating possible flux deviations  <cit> , and genomic and transcriptomic information. to develop a classification system that is readily applicable for predicting essential genes of a new query organism, the system needs to make accurate predictions for an organism on which it was not trained. therefore, we performed a cross-validation across the organisms of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, i.e. we trained with e. coli and validated with p. aeruginosa  to obtain the quality of the performance of this approach. we then applied the trained and validated classifiers to the pathogenic bacterium salmonella typhimurium. we compared our results with the literature and experimental data of a large knock-out study for s. typhimurium  <cit> . furthermore, we analyzed our predictions with gene set enrichment tests for metabolic pathways and identified proteins of the entire non-mevalonate pathway to be relevant for targeting with drugs. its reactions showed typically topological characteristics of essential reactions. using our prediction results and the experimental knock-out screen, we defined  <dig> enzymes as drug targets for s. typhimurium,  <dig> out of which have been described previously as drug targets in other micro-organisms. we suggest these and the remaining twelve as potential new drug targets for the organism we studied .

RESULTS
predicting essential genes with an organism-wise cross validation
the general workflow is depicted in figure  <dig>  we reconstructed the metabolic networks for the investigated organisms by a bipartite graph consisting of alternating reactions and compounds. two reactions were linked by a compound if the compound was a product of one reaction and a substrate of the other. the machine learning system was trained and validated with a large set of features. local topology based features were used to qualitatively describe possible flux deviations. choke and load points were defined and damage was used to describe the qualitative flux load and down stream effects of the knocked down reaction. centrality features were calculated to additionally estimate the load of the reactions. we considered the existence of homologous genes for the corresponding knocked out genes which may be expected to take over the function. co-regulated genes were considered to estimate the existence of possible analogous genes. phyletic retention was calculated for observing phylogenetic conservation of the gene which was knocked out. codon usages were calculated for each gene and used as features. all features are listed in table  <dig> and are described in detail in the methods. we started predicting essential genes for e. coli. for this, we trained classifiers  with the experimental data of two genome-wide knock-out screens of pseudomonas aeruginosa . these datasets were taken as our gold standard defining true positives and true negatives of essential genes in the metabolism of the training organism . we trained several  classifiers with all essential genes and an equal amount of randomly selected non-essential genes . the trained machines were then applied to predict essential genes for the query organism . the output of all machines was summed up and used as a voting score that represented the propensity of a gene to be lethal for the cell. in turn, the same scheme was applied to predict essential genes for p. aeruginosa with classifiers which were now trained with two datasets from e. coli . this organism-wise cross-validation was applied to estimate the performance of the classifiers. we compared the datasets for each genome.  <dig> of the essential genes were common in ecob and ecog,  <dig> were common in pael and paej. one hundred machines were trained with different training-sets for each knock-out screen. votes from both training sets for an organism were summed up and defined the stringency. a high number of votes for essentiality led to high specificity, while lower numbers led to higher sensitivity. the resulting receiver operator curves  of the classifiers are shown in figure 2a for predicting p. aeruginosa and figure 2b for predicting e. coli. for predicting essential genes for p. aeruginosa we yielded an area under the curve  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  when compared to the experimental datasets pael and paej, respectively. in turn, for e. coli we yielded an auc of  <dig>  and  <dig>  when compared to ecob and ecog, respectively. we wanted to obtain a reliable list of potential drug targets. for this, predictions for essential genes needed a low number of false positives. hence, we set a high stringency and calculated the precision  with a high selection criterion . we yielded a precision of 67%  and 100%  when predicting essential genes for p. aeruginosa. in turn, we yielded a precision of 61%  and 65%  for e. coli. we yielded the best classifier results when using all features, in comparison to the classification performance when using individual sets of features .

examining the features
we wanted to obtain an estimate of the correlations of our features to the essentiality of a gene. therefore, we calculated pearson's correlation coefficients of the essentiality class of each gene  and the corresponding feature values. figure  <dig> gives an overview for all features . in the following, we describe the major results of our correlation study.

topology features
the efficiency of flux deviations was estimated by the features rup and pup which gave an estimate if all products of the knocked-out reaction could be produced without the reaction  and how large the percentage of non-producible products  was. rup was a boolean feature to observe if the mutant could produce all products of the knocked-out reaction. rup =  <dig> was set if all downstream products could be produced by the mutant while rup was set to zero if at least one downstream product could not be produced. the number of reachable products  was highly negative correlated and the percentage of unreachable products  highly positive correlated to the essentiality of a gene  as shown in figure 3a. if the  mutant could not produce one or more downstream products, rup was zero whereas the percentage of unreachable products was increased in comparison to the situation in which all products could be produced. the higher the percentage of unreachable products of the mutant, the less products of the knocked out enzyme could be covered by alternative pathways. the number of substrates and products of the reactions of the knocked out gene  were positively correlated to gene essentiality  showing that essential enzymes metabolize more different compounds. interestingly, the number of neighboring reactions  and the number of neighbors of neighboring reactions  showed a weak negative correlation to essentiality . this is reasonable as a reaction with a high number of neighboring reactions may have more metabolites as products that can be produced by alternative enzymes. the clustering coefficients  showed the same tendency  also pointing to advantageous alternative pathways.

we estimated the feasibility of possible flux deviations by a set of features describing alternative pathways. the number of alternative pathways , the average path length of the deviations  and the length of the shortest alternative path  described the feasibility of alternative pathways. as expected, all of them were negatively correlated to essentiality , i.e. knocked out enzymes for which alternative pathways existed were less likely to cause a lethal phenotype if knocked out. choke-points  are uniquely consumed or produced compounds in the metabolism and showed a positive correlation with essentiality  as choke-points are often difficult to be replaced by the rest of the metabolism. load-scores  give an estimate of how often a reaction is involved in metabolic processes. they were also positively correlated to essentiality . betweenness centrality  and eccentricity  were strongly positive correlated to essentiality  showing that enzymes have a higher influence on vitality if placed in the center of the network. closeness centrality  also showed a positive correlation . interestingly, the eigenvector centrality  showed a negative correlation . betweenness, closeness and eccentricity centrality are global centrality measures considering the whole network while the eigenvector centrality is a measure for local centrality and is computed from its neighbors. note that typically a node with a high value of eigenvector centrality is a hub  with other hubs connected to it. hence, flux deviations may be more likely for local hubs that have hubs in their vicinity making the node replaceable whereas global central nodes seemed to be generally substantial for maintaining the metabolic flow in the network. therefore the eigenvector centrality may describe the network topology more in the sense as the clustering coefficient, specifically in respect to the likelihood of alternative pathways.

genomic and transcriptomic features
as expected, the number of homologous genes  showed a negative correlation to essentiality . interestingly, an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig>  worked best showing that also non-perfectly matching sequences may take over functions of the knocked out gene. the number of genes having similar expression  exhibited also a negative correlation to essentiality  which may be due to co-expression of genes with analogous function. for the feature phyletic retention , the number of prokaryotes having orthologs of the knocked out gene showed a positive correlation to essentiality  supporting the findings of a previous study that conserved genes in evolution hint for their essentiality  <cit> .

we analyzed the codon usage for each gene and related these to the essentiality of the gene. we found that genes with a high number of the nucleotide thymine at the third position of the codons were more likely to be essential for cell viability . the third codon position is the most redundant position in the genetic code. matching of mrna to trna codon nucleotides is less robust at the third position, and translational errors are therefore more likely to occur at that position. however, essential genes need to be stable and to be protected in the sequence. thymine in the genetic code might cope for this as it was shown that thymine protected dna and improved the efficiency of dna replication  <cit> . conserved genes are more likely to be essential  <cit>  and a thymine at the 3rd codon position facilitates stable genetic inheritance into off-springs and cellular replicates. interestingly, we observed a larger difference of t3s in e. coli when compared to p. aeruginosa. it was found that a large average of g and c content at the third codon position is common for all genes in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . these results in a low t content at the third codon position which we observed and may explain the larger difference of t3s for essential and non-essential genes in e. coli compared to p. aeruginosa .

even though decision trees performed inferior compared to support vector machines , we used decision trees for an alternative approach to determine the most discriminating features for gene essentiality. decision trees were trained with the datasets ecob, ecog, pael and paej. it is known that the first decision of a decision tree is performed with the best discriminating feature  <cit> . therefore, we counted the occurrence of our features at the top position of each run. out of  <dig> runs, we got t3s , bw , nc , h <dig> , h <dig> , val , h <dig> , ngse , pup  as the first decision . this again showed that the feature for t3s substantially supported the classification.

identifying drug targets for s. typhimurium
we applied our trained machines from all four datasets  to predict essential genes for s. typhimurium and obtained votes from four hundred machines for each gene of s. typhimurium to be essential. to obtain a reasonable threshold for the number of votes predicting a gene to be essential, we compared the number of essentially predicted genes with the numbers of the training sets for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. for e. coli  <dig> and  <dig> genes were essential corresponding to the datasets ecob and ecog, respectively, and for p. aeruginosa,  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, we set a threshold of  <dig> votes  to classify a gene as essential for s. typhimurium and obtained a comparable amount of  <dig> predicted essential genes. the complete list of genes being predicted as essential is given in the supplement . we then compared our results to the experimental data from knuth and co-workers who performed a large knock-out study for s. typhimurium  <cit> . they detected 6% of all open reading frames as being essential including  <dig> essential genes coding for enzymes in metabolism. for the remaining open reading frames of the genome they didn't make any prediction, including  <dig> genes for enzymes in metabolism. we compared the list of essential genes of knuth and co-workers with our predictions and found  <dig> of our predicted genes in the list of knuth and co-workers yielding a precision of 21%, an accuracy of 83% and sensitivity of 51%. it is to note that the experimental screen of knuth and co-workers was not comprehensive; the authors stated in their article that for the genes not to be predicted as essential, they couldn't conclude that these genes are definitely non-essential. therefore, our novel predictions may suit as potential new targets for further investigations. as a conservative and robust estimate of essential genes for s. typhimurium, we defined the corresponding enzymes of genes which were experimentally determined  and were recognized by our classifiers. we then searched in the literature to find drug treatments of these enzymes for other micro-organisms. the results are listed in the following. two asterisks  mark a gene for which enzyme we found clear evidence to be a drug target for a micro-organism. one asterisk  was set for a gene when we found reasonable evidence for its enzyme to serve as a drug target for a micro-organism. hence, enzymes with one asterisk may serve for finding new drug targets and enzymes with two asterisks for transferring drug targets from other bacterial diseases to the disease we studied . table  <dig> gives an overview of the results. we compared the open reading frames of the predicted genes with the human transcripts and did not detect significant homologs . e-values of the best hits are given in the supplement . here is the brief summary of the literature evidences we found:

the non-mevalonate pathway and fatty acid biosynthesis are highly enriched with essential genes of s. typhimurium
we performed gene set enrichment tests  with all pathways from kegg  <cit>  and found a significant enrichment of essential genes in the non-mevalonate pathway  and in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway . most of the genes in these pathways were essential  produces isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate  that serve as a basis for the production of sterols, dolichols, and ubiquinone as well as components of macromolecules such as prenyl groups in proteins  <cit> . the pathway for non-mevalonate biosynthesis has been considered previously for attractive targets of novel antibiotics against bacteria  <cit>  including s. typhimurium  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the non-mevalonate pathway and its essential enzymes for s. typhimurium. note that the arrows in the figure do not represent information about the irreversibility of these reactions but rather show the direction of the overall flux. this rather linear pathway starts at 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate-synthase  which corresponding gene dxs has been identified to be essential also by the experimental knock-out study of knuth and co-workers  <cit> . the next six enzymes downstream were predicted to be essential by our method. the last enzyme we found in this pathway was geranyltranstransferase . it catalyzes a reaction to produce farnesyl-diphosphate. recently, cornish and co-workers performed an elaborated mutagenesis study of the non-melavonate pathway in s. typhimurium and found five genes to be essential   <cit> . we propose that all eight enzymes in this pathway are promising potential drug targets for s. typhimurium. we searched in the literature and indicated our findings by one and two asterisks as described above. for two genes we found clear evidences  and for six genes reasonable evidences  to code for drug targets .

CONCLUSIONS
we established a machine learning approach that predicts the essentiality of genes for an organism when no experimental knock-out data is available. the classifiers were trained with essentiality information for genes of one organism  and were employed to predict essential genes of the other organism . these predictions did not depend on essentiality information of the query organism for which the predictions were made, but solely on features that were calculated from the metabolic network and genomic and transcriptomic information of the query organism. such data is abundantly available for many pathogenic bacteria. we applied this method to predict essential genes of salmonella typhimurium as the query organism of interest and proposed  <dig> potential drug targets.  <dig> targets resulted from the intersection between our predictions and an experimental study  <cit>  and  <dig> targets of the non-mevalonate pathway which we found by a statistical enrichment analysis. the non-mevalonate pathway is essential in algae, plants and several eubacteria including pathogenic bacteria. enzymes of this pathway have been described to be potential targets for the development of novel antibiotics and herbicidal agents  <cit> . for s. typhimurium, we also inferred this by our machine learning approach. we discovered interesting correlations of our features to the essentiality of a gene. various features describing the network topology served the machine to select reactions that showed no possible pathways for flux deviations, as e.g. in the linear non-mevalonate pathway. an intelligent combination of these features may be seen as an alternative approach to the established methods of flux balance analyses  and elementary flux modes  if detailed growth and nutrient information is lacking .

our method served well to estimate genes and their corresponding enzymes in the bacterial organisms of e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. typhimurium. inferring essentiality information for an organism from another organism may be facilitated by investigating a closely related organism as we did with s. typhimurium being rather closely related to e. coli. to apply this method to other micro-organisms, the metabolism may need to be well described, and the method may need adaptation for less studied organisms or which show special metabolic capabilities. for applying this method to eukaryotic genomes, the compartments in the cell at which a reaction occurs may need to be considered. it will be very challenging to apply our method for inferring multiple drug targets using experimental double knock-out screens as e.g. of the synthetic lethal project of esga  <cit> . for this, attributes that are related to single players  might be of less relevance while specifically network features might be much more related to synergistic knock-out effects. the challenge for the future remains to integrate such topological descriptive approaches with genetic information to systematically explore the network effects of enzyme treatments and combinations thereof.
