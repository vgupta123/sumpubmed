BACKGROUND
copy number variations  are defined as dna sequences ranging from 1 kb to few mb that have different numbers of repeats among individuals
 <cit> . comparing with single nucleotide polymorphisms , cnvs represent a higher percentage of genetic variation and have greater effects on a genome
 <cit> . for example, cnvs play roles in determining phenotypic difference among individuals through changing gene structure and dosage, regulating gene expression and function
 <cit> . in addition to normal phenotypic variation, cnvs are also related to genetic disease susceptibility
 <cit> . and recently, cnv detection is substantially carried out in domesticated animals and these studies revealed that cnvs are associated with several phenotypic traits. for example, duplication of kit gene in pigs determines the dominant white locus
 <cit> ; while in sheep, the coat color is related to the duplication of asip <cit> . in ridgeback dogs, hair ridge and predisposition to dermoid sinus are caused by duplication of  <dig> genes 
 <cit> ; and in shar-pei dogs, the wrinkled skin phenotype and a periodic fever syndrome are caused by upstream duplication of has <dig> <cit> . also, partial deletion of ed <dig> gene in bovine caused anhidrotic ecodermal dysplasia
 <cit> . in avian species, cnv in intron  <dig> of the sox <dig> gene led to the pea-comb phenotype in chicken
 <cit> . thus, detection of cnvs at a whole-genome level can give a lot of useful information and has been carried out in several domesticated animals, including pigs, sheep, cattle, dogs,horses and chickens
 <cit>  as well as crops
 <cit> . however, there is no information on cnvs in silkworm.

the domesticated silkworm , a model of lepidoptera insects, has great economic value because of its silk production as well as its value as a good bioreactor
 <cit> . it is widely accepted that b. mori is domesticated from the wild silkworm, bombyx mandarina, about 5000 years ago
 <cit> . and nowadays, more than  <dig>  bombyx mori inbred and mutant strains are kept all over the world
 <cit> . in  <dig>  an estimated 432 mb silkworm genome was published
 <cit> , with  <dig> -fold sequence coverage and n <dig> size of ~ <dig>  mb. and 87% of the scaffold sequences anchored to all  <dig> chromosomes, which can provide us a reliable genome to analyze the cnvs in silkworm. a previous study showed that the copy number of carotenoid-binding protein , a major determinant of cocoon color, varied greatly among b. mori strains
 <cit> . thus, the detection of cnvs at a whole-genome level is necessary for understanding phenotypic variations between different silkworms.

as far as we know, comparative genomic hybridization  and snp arrays are routinely used for cnv identification
 <cit> . however, the power of cnv detection is easily influenced by low probe density. in addition, although a subset of cnvs showed evidence of linkage disequilibrium with flanking snps
 <cit> , a significant number of cnvs located in the regions are not well recovered by snp arrays
 <cit> .

with the development of next-generation sequencing  and complementary analysis program, there are some better approaches to screen cnvs systematically at a whole-genome level. generally, ngs employed the read depth  methods to analyze data and previous studies indicated that data with the genome coverage greater than  <dig> fold are sufficient for rd detection of cnvs
 <cit> . to date, several methods have exploited sequence data in  <dig> genomes project pilot studies to detect cnvs
 <cit> . and several programs are developed to analyze cnvs. these programs included cnanorm , bayesian information criterion
 <cit> , readdepth
 <cit> , cnv-seq
 <cit> , mrsfast
 <cit>  and so on
 <cit> . specifically, an r package named readdepth can detect cnvs based on sequence depth and then invoke a circular binary segmentation algorithm to call segment boundaries
 <cit> . this program has high sensitivity and specificity and is appropriate for screening cnvs in duplication and repeat-rich regions
 <cit> . in this study, we resequenced  <dig> silkworms . then, we first used readdepth to screen the silkworm cnvs at a genome level and second used cnanorm to recheck the cnvs, which can result in the high-confidence cnvs. finally we tried to explore the distribution pattern and potential functions of the cnvs.

RESULTS
resequencing and cnv identification
we resequenced  <dig> silkworms:  <dig> domesticated and  <dig> wild silkworms. the sequencing coverage of these silkworms is greater than  <dig>  indicating that the data are sufficient for cnv identification . the readdepth was employed to predict cnvs among four silkworms. the initial results of cnvs identified by readdepth were listed in table 
 <dig> and the location information for each of initial cnvs is shown in additional file
 <dig>  for further analysis, we retained only cnvs obtained by a more stringent criterion . in order to prevent the false positive, we use this conservative filtering way, however, there should be some false negative regions that were abandoned from our analysis, especially regions with lower copy numbers in the genome. the filtration results are also listed in table 
 <dig> . we identified ~ <dig> suggestive cnvs, size ranging from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  kbp. the  <dig> cnvs covered  <dig>  mb. then, we used another method cnanorm to identify the cnv regions in silkworm. the potential cnvs identified by cnanorm are listed in additional file
 <dig>  comparison of the results showed that  <dig>  of  <dig> cnvs by the readdepth were also identified by the cnanorm , which is about  <dig> % of the silkworm genome. in the following analysis, we focused on these high-confidence cnvs .

the initial cnvs calls were kept if the rd values that differ significantly from the average rd and then filtered by cnanorm.

among four silkworms, the domesticated silkworm n <dig> contained the largest number of cnvs while wild silkworm nanc contained the fewest. as expected, the “uncharacterized chromosome” , sequences that cannot be mapped to the genome, contains most cnvs , which is consistent with the observation in cattle
 <cit> . however, the cnvs on chrun need to be further investigated since chrun contigs are shorter and mapping of chrun sequence reads is ambiguous. in our study, cnv detection would be leveraged on the reference genome, thus, copy numbers are reported more like relative copies comparing to the reference genome. a well assembled reference as well as the well-annotated duplications in genome would be important to the cnv detection using this method. therefore, the correct assemble of the contigs on chrun as well as annotations of repeats in the genome may help to improve the identification of cnvs. in order to get the accurate information about the cnvs and excluded false positives, clone-ordered-based approaches for sequence assembly and further annotation of repeats are needed in further study. the remaining cnvs are distributed on the silkworm chromosomes 1– <dig> and there is no cnv on the chromosome  <dig> 

the positions of cnvs were determined independently within each silkworm and we compared them among different silkworms. generally, we classified the duplicated sequences as shared or specific to an individual based on the predicted absolute copy numbers. the results showed that most of the cnvs were shared among two or more silkworms . specifically, the domesticated silkworm n <dig> had the largest number of unique cnvs while wild silkworm nanc contained the smallest number of unique cnvs . in general, a genome is assumed to be more tolerant to duplications than to deletions
 <cit> , accordingly, cnv gain should be more than loss. however, we found that silkworm had more cnv losses than gains, which is consistent with other species
 <cit> . this result may be due to biological as well as technical reasons. one of the most important mechanisms which may be responsible for cnv formation, named as non-allelic homologous recombination, was proven to generate more deletions than duplications
 <cit> . on the other hand, the detection method may favor the identification of deletions as reported in several other studies
 <cit> . however, to validate the real status of cnvs, other techniques such as quantitative pcr  is necessary.

as previous study showed, the heatmap can also reflect evolutionary relationships among diverse species
 <cit> . thus, we constructed a heatmap for  <dig> silkworms using absolute copy numbers in the cnv regions obtained by readdepth . as expected,  <dig> domesticated silkworms clustered together as other two wild silkworms did. a previous study suggested that a cluster tree constructed by the heatmap of individual-specific cnvs is usually consistent with the individual history
 <cit> . thus, genomic loci with great agriculture values or qtls can be identified if there is a larger silkworm sample size and outgroup.

overlapping of cnvs with segmental duplications 
previous studies showed that cnvs were enriched in sds
 <cit> . to test this, we compared the cnvs to the sds identified by wssd and wgac approaches in our previous study
 <cit> . before filtering the initial cnvs using rd, there were about 94% of sds exhibiting initial cnvs. and after filtration, approximately 60% of suggestive cnvs directly overlapped with sds .
 <dig>  the silkworm assembly scaffold is represented as black bars. larger bars in colors which intersect the scaffold represent the segmental duplications and copy number variation.

generally, it is accepted that sds provide substrates of gene and genome innovation as well as genome rearrangement. sds are also hotspots of formation of cnvs. thus, sds may arise from ancient cnvs fixed in the population
 <cit> . as observed in other animals , there is a consistency  between large cnvs and sds 
 <cit> . thus, the association of large cnvs with sds supports the hypothesis that cnv formation is mainly due to nonallelic homologous recombination . this mechanism was proven to generate more deletions than duplications
 <cit> .

gene content of cnv regions and functional annotation
there are  <dig> functional genes resided at these high-confidence cnv loci. and  <dig> genes of them are duplicated in the silkworm genome. for example, cnv locus on scaffold  <dig>  encodes a hsp <dig>  protein. in silkworm, a second copy of hsp <dig> is located on nscaf <dig> .

we found that several genes in cnvs are involved in drug detoxification, defense and receptor and signal recognition, which is consistent with previous observations in mammals 
 <cit> . the expression patterns also validated this . these gene families include cytochrome p <dig>  carboxylesterases, moricin, trypsin and olfactory receptor , which shared similar go terms . interestingly, these gene families were repeatedly detected in cnvs of several mammalian genomes including humans, mouse, dog, cattle. this suggests that cnvs play important roles in evolution of organisms.

the functional genes located in cnvs possess a large spectrum of go molecular functions  and provide a wonderful resource for validating the hypothesis that phenotypic variation within and among silkworms may be related to cnvs. for example, the carotenoid-binding protein , a major determinant of cocoon color, was found to have different copy numbers among the domesticated silkworms, ranging from  <dig> to 20
 <cit> . in present study, we also found that cbp gene  is in cnv regions in  <dig>  of  <dig> silkworms investigated. this also further validated the efficacy of our cnv detection.

genes with molecular function falling in binding and catalytic are enriched in the cnvs as well as sds  , which proved that particular gene classes are overrepresented in cnvs. a lot of these genes may very important in the lineage-specific adaptions of the organism to a particular environment. for example, antimicrobial peptides  genes, which play important roles in innate immune system in insects
 <cit> , were found to be enriched in silkworm cnvs . furthermore, since silkworm has to digest the secondary products in the mulberry leaves, some enzymes should be evolved to adapt to it
 <cit> . for example, cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are involved in such biological processes in the silkworm
 <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> genes belonged to p <dig> gene family. we also identified carboxylesterase , which involved in xenobiotic detoxification as well as pheromone degradation
 <cit> , in the cnvs regions. other genes family related with important functions in lineage-specific evolution included lipoprotein_ <dig>  heat shock proteins are also identified in our study .

comparative analysis of silkworm cnvs
in order to obtain information related to phenotypic characteristics as much as possible, we classified cnvs as individual-specific, domesticated-specific, wild-specific and all-possessed. generally, most of the cnvs were shared among two or more silkworms . however, we identified  <dig> individual-specific cnvs. domesticated-specific cnvs are more than wild-specific ones . furthermore, the read depth validated this result . take scaffold  <dig> as example , the rd for nanc is less than  <dig> comparing with the average depth of  <dig> . and ak’ rd is less than  <dig> comparing with the average rd of  <dig> .
 <dig>  the read depth are shown the rd for xiaf, n <dig>  nanc and ak.  depth comparison of cnvs in four silkworms for the region 1– <dig> of scaffold  <dig> shows wild-specific region .  depth comparison of cnvs in four silkworms for the region 1– <dig> of scaffold  <dig> shows domesticated-specific region .  depth comparison of cnvs in four silkworms for the region 1– <dig> of nscaf  <dig> shows all-possess region .

we investigated the genes in the regions of domesticated-specific, wild-specific and all-possessed cnvs. the domesticated-specific cnvs contained  <dig> functional genes, while wild-specific cnvs contained only  <dig> genes. we also surveyed the functions and expression patterns of these genes. most of the genes in these cnv regions are related to detoxification, reproduction and immunity since they were expressed in midgut, testis, ovary and homocyte, respectively. in domesticated-specific cnv regions, there is an extra gene cluster which was expressed in silkgland . however, most members of this gene cluster were poorly annotated in the silkworm database, indicating that the functional information on the genes in cnvs has been very limited to date. this deserves further investigation in future.

cnv validation by quantitative pcr
we used real time quantitative pcr  to validate cnvs in  <dig> genomic regions as well as  <dig> genes. four of five loci  were validated by this method . for the exception, the silkworm genome has two copies of target_r <dig>  based on the blastn searches against b. mori. and the qpcr results showed little variation among  <dig> silkworms  at this locus. this might be:  prediction errors of cnvs, that is, the false positive;  polymorphisms such as indels and snps that influence binding of the qpcr primers. for four validated regions, we found that there was a big difference in copy number at the locus of target_r <dig> between domesticated and wild silkworms. that is, domesticated silkworm contained more copies than wild type at this locus based on the qpcr results. also, this region belongs to domesticated-specific region. furthermore, we found that only one gene  is located in this cnv region. however, this gene was poorly annotated so far. a previous study showed that this gene was specifically and highly expressed in testis, indicated that this gene may play important roles in reproduction
 <cit> . further study is needed to characterize its function.

besides, we also chose  <dig> genes to validate the presence of cnvs in different silkworms . a total of  <dig> silkworms  were examined: eight of ten genes can be validated by qpcr, except for two genes . f-test was performed to check whether copy number detected using qpcr showed homogeneity of variance between the reference silkworm and silkworms to be examined. the result suggested that all these  <dig> loci in silkworms to be examined had greater variance than those in the reference silkworm  , confirming that the cnvs identified in this study are reliable. for these  <dig> genes, one  belonged to p <dig> gene family, one  belonged to coesterase andone  belonged to carotenoid-binding protein. a previous study of microarray expression profiling showed that two  of  <dig> genes were highly expressed in head, integument and hemocyte
 <cit> . another gene, bgibmga014052-ta, was specially and highly expressed in malpighian tubule, implying its important role in detoxification in silkworm. bgibmga010640-ta, which is involved in lipid metabolic process , was highly expressed in midgut. midgut of silkworm is very important because of its key functions in digesting, resistance and immune response. genes expressed highly in midgut suggest its important roles in nutrient digestion and absorption, resistance and immune response in silkworm. a previous study used four pathogens to challenge silkworm and investigated the genome-wide gene expression profiles by a microarray
 <cit> . we exploited this dataset to check the expression pattern of bgibmga010640-ta as well as expression patterns of another  <dig> genes that were proven to be resistant to nucleopolyhedrovirus 
 <cit> . like the above  <dig> genes, bgibmga010640-ta could be induced by  <dig> pathogens 
 <cit> . this suggested that bgibmga010640-ta may be involved in immune response of silkworm.

the cnvs  were confirmed to be positive cnvs by qrt-pcr . it should be emphasized that not all true cnvs could be detected by qpcr, especially some low-copy duplications with less sequence similarities. thus,  <dig> % for false positive rate is a conserved estimate in our cnv analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed the first cnvs map in silkworm based on next-generation re-sequencing data. a total of ~ <dig> cnvs were identified in the silkworm genome. we presented the frequency, pattern and gene-content of these cnvs. our results indicated that the genes in cnvs may be involved in specific biological functions such as reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition. besides, we identified  <dig> cnvs that may be individual-specific. most of genes in these  <dig> regions were also related to reproduction or detoxification. the data presented in this study provided insight into the evolution of the silkworm genome and an invaluable resource for insect genomics research.
