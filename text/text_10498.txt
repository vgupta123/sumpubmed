BACKGROUND
promoters play a very important role in the initiation and regulation of gene transcription, and they are important components in transgenic engineering  <cit> . promoters can be divided into three types: constitutive, specific, and inducible. constitutive promoters are widely used in genetic engineering. the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter directs the expression of target genes in almost all tissues at all developmental stages  <cit> . however, the constitutive expression of transgenes is not always desirable for research and application. constitutive expression for research purposes would conceal the elaborate function of transgenes, especially in signal transduction, energy transformation, and material transportation. constitutive expression for applied purposes may cause an extra metabolic burden or toxic effects in transgenic plants. the repetitive use of the same promoter in genetic transformation is one of the major reasons for transgenic silencing  <cit> . therefore, the development of specific or inducible promoters is necessary.

inducible promoters are often regulated by particular chemical and physical factors, such as light, wounding, temperature, ph, hormones  <cit> . they can strongly enhance gene expression, and some of them are also specific  <cit> .

tissue-specific promoters are a type of specific promoters that drive gene expression within specific tissues or organs. many specific promoters with different tissue specificities have been isolated and studied in transgenic research, including root-specific promoters  <cit> , flower organ-specific promoters  <cit> , seed-specific promoters  <cit> , and fruit-specific promoters  <cit> . hormones or abiotic stresses may regulate tissue-specific promoters. for example, wounds induce the rice mt promoter, which is preferentially expressed in roots and flowers  <cit> . the root-specific promoter, pspr <dig>  expresses higher gus in response to the abiotic stresses nacl, peg <dig> and mannitol as well as in response to sa, aba and ja  <cit> . however, some tissue-specific promoters may have low activity or specificity, especially when these promoters drive gene expression in heterologous plants.

soybeans are faced with severe root-related pathogens, pests, malnutrition and other abiotic stresses  <cit> . soybean production suffers heavy losses from root-related biotic or abiotic stresses annually. for example, the soybean cyst nematode   was the primary cause for the suppression of soybean yield in the us from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the yield suppression due to scn in the us was approximately  <dig>  million tons during these  <dig> years  <cit> . however, no efficient and economical methods have been developed to combat these diseases. therefore, transgenic technology using root-specific promoters is promising because a transgenic soybean with a constitutive promoter has been successful worldwide  <cit> .

alfalfa a <dig>  rice rcc <dig> and rcc <dig>  carrot prp <dig>  maize zrp <dig> and bean pvr <dig>  which all encode a proline-rich protein , are expressed preferentially in root  <cit> . three members of the prp family are expressed in soybean with distinct, individual patterns of expression in different organs and at different development stages  <cit> . gmprp <dig> and gmprp <dig> exhibit root-specific expression  <cit> . soybean prp <dig> mrna is highly abundant in the elongating and mature region of the hypocotyls epidermal cells of seedlings. soybean prp <dig> mrna accumulates in phloem cells, and prp <dig> mrna is specifically localized to the endodermoid layer of cells in the hypocotyl-elongating region  <cit> . prps are expressed with spatiotemporal specificity  <cit> . moreover, factors associated with biotic and abiotic stresses also influence the expression of prps  <cit> .

some genes encoding prps have been isolated from soybean, but the function of the prp promoters is not well characterized. here, we cloned the gmprp <dig> promoter and studied its expression activity in transgenic arabidopsis and soybean hairy roots.

RESULTS
detection of gmprp <dig> expression by quantitative realtime pcr
gmprp <dig> expression was investigated by real-time pcr from root, stem, leaf, flower, seed and hypocotyl. the expression level was highest in the root, and second in the hypocotyl, seed and stem. the level in the leaf and flower were much lower than in the root . therefore, gmprp <dig> gene showed a root-preferential expression.figure  <dig>

cloning and sequence analysis of the gmprp <dig> promoter 
a  <dig>  bp 5’ flanking region fragment of the prp <dig> gene was amplified using first-round pcr. this fragment contained a  <dig> bp gmprp <dig> gene partial coding sequence. the second pcr product contained a  <dig>  bp flanking sequence upstream of the translated initiation codon. the first nucleotide of gmprp <dig> cdna was designated as + <dig> to orient the sequence numbers. the promoter sequence was analyzed using the place and plantcare web tools. several putative cis-regulatory elements were deciphered from the promoter sequence of gmprp <dig> . tata box sequence elements, which were required for critical and precise transcription initiation, were found in the − <dig> region of the sequence. caat box sequences, which were responsible for the tissue-specific promoter activity, were found at numerous positions: − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig>  ose2rootnodule sequences, which were responsible for an organ-specific promoter activity in infected cells of root nodules, were found at − <dig> and − <dig>  rootmotiftapox <dig> sequence elements, which were required for organ specificity, were identified at the − <dig> position. ose2rootnodule elements and rootmotiftapox <dig> element are critical for root-specific expression.figure  <dig>

serial 5’-deletion fragments were created to identify the core region of the gmprp2p- <dig> that controlled tissue-specific expression: gmprp2p- <dig>  gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig>  which were  <dig>   <dig> and 369 bp in length, respectively, according to the density of the cis-elements on the promoter sequence .

spatiotemporal expression patterns of gmprp2p- <dig> and the 5’-deletion fragments in arabidopsis
gmprp2p- <dig> driven gus expression was monitored during plant development and in various organs using histochemical staining in t <dig> transgenic lines of arabidopsis grown on 1/ <dig> ms medium to precisely define the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the gmprp <dig> promoter. gus expression was detected in hypocotyls and roots in 1-day-old and 3-day-old seedlings carrying the gmprp2p- <dig> construct, but gus staining was not detected in the cotyledons and apical roots . gus expression was detected strongly in roots of the 5-day-old and 7-day-old seedlings, but the staining was a little weak in the hypocotyls. gus expression in 10-day-old and 20-day-old seedlings was similar to that of the younger seedlings.figure  <dig>

the 5’-deletion fragments were also fused to the gus gene and transformed into arabidopsis. gus staining showed that the gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs presented similar expression patterns as the gmprp2p- <dig> construct, which was high in roots and hypocotyls, except leaves. gus staining was not visible with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct . fluorometric gus assays revealed that gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs drove strong gus activity in roots, and gus activity was significantly reduced in gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs compared with gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs . the 5’-deletions of the gmprp2p- <dig> from − <dig> to − <dig> slightly increased gus activity. a further deletion to − <dig> obviously decreased gus activity, and a deletion to − <dig> was slightly better than − <dig>  however, the gus expression level in these plants was much lower than in the transgenic plants with gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs. we speculated that the promoter fragment from − <dig> to − <dig> may contain the suppressor which induced the expression level increased in gmprp2p- <dig> compared with gmprp2p- <dig>  the gus activity in roots was obviously higher than in leaves, regardless of the promoter fragment except gmprp2- <dig>  the results of gus staining and fluorometric gus assays were uniform.figure  <dig>

gus expression was observed in the roots of all promoter fragment constructs, except the gmprp2p- <dig> construct. gus staining appeared in the petiole during the reproductive growth stage, and emerged in the split margins besides the abscission in siliques, but the expression levels were quite weak. gus staining was not detected in flowers and seeds. furthermore, gus staining was not visible in any organs of plants containing the gmprp2p- <dig> construct .figure  <dig>

meja and iaa increased and ga, aba and sa decreased the gus activity of the gmprp2p- <dig> and 5’-deletion fragments
we tested the gus activity in the roots of 20-day-old transgenic seedlings treated with 1 mm sa, 100 μm meja, 100 μm iaa, 100 μm ga, and 100 μm aba for 24 h to assess the response of the gmprp2p- <dig> and 5’-deletion fragments to various hormones. seedlings treated with h2o and wild type seedlings treated with the above stressors were used as controls. meja enhanced the gus activity in transgenic seedlings containing the gmprp2p- <dig> construct compared to h2o control samples . the gus activity was increased by  <dig> -fold ,  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  in the three transgenic lines. similar results were observed in seedlings transformed with the gmprp2p- <dig>  gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs. the gus activity was increased one to three times in transgenic lines. iaa increased the gus activity in most transgenic seedlings with different constructs by one to two times .figure  <dig>

with different constructs  in roots in responses to meja, iaa, sa, ga, aba, nacl, peg. the gus activity for each treatment was measured in 20-day-old seedlings from each of three independent transgenic lines. transgenic seedlings were treated for 24 h. control seedlings were treated with water. p1062- <dig>  p1062- <dig>  and p1062- <dig> are the three transgenic lines carrying the gmprp2p- <dig> construct; p852- <dig>  p852- <dig>  and p852- <dig> are the three transgenic lines carrying the gmprp2p- <dig> construct; p471- <dig>  p471- <dig>  and p471- <dig> are the three transgenic lines carrying the gmprp2p- <dig> construct; p369- <dig>  p369- <dig>  and p369- <dig> are the three transgenic lines carrying the gmprp2p- <dig> construct. data are presented as the means of three replicates with se shown by vertical bars. *and** differ significantly by one-sided paired t test at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively.



sa and ga treatments decreased the gus activity approximately 40-70% in transgenic seedlings with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct and approximately 70-80% in transgenic seedlings with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct. the gus activity was decreased 70-90% in transgenic seedlings with the gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs. aba treatment slightly decreased the gus activity approximately 30-60% in most transgenic seedlings compared to sa and ga treatments .

nacl and peg increased the activity of the gmprp2p- <dig> and the 5’-deletion fragments
we tested gus activity in the roots of 20-day-old transgenic seedlings treated with 200 mm nacl and 20% peg <dig> for 24 h to identify the response of gmprp2p- <dig> and 5’-deletion fragments to environmental stresses. the seedlings treated with h2o and wild type seedlings treated with the above stressor were used as controls. nacl and peg treatment enhanced gus activity. nacl treatment increased gus activity by  <dig> -fold ,  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  in the three gmprp2p- <dig> transgenic lines. the gus activity was increased one to two times in most of the transgenic lines with the other constructs . peg treatment increased the gus activity in all transgenic lines carrying different constructs, and greatly increased the gus activity by  <dig> -fold ,  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  in the gmprp2p- <dig> transgenic lines . however, the gus levels were much lower in the gmprp2p- <dig> transgenic lines than in the gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> transgenic lines .

the expression patterns of gmprp2p- <dig> and the 5’-deletion fragments in soybean hairy roots
numerous branched roots developed from each wound site on the cotyledon after agrobacterium rhizogenes k <dig> infection and co-cultivation. the entire cotyledon with hairy roots was used for gus staining. the 35s promoter drove strong gus staining . gmprp2p- <dig>  gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> also drove gus staining in soybean hairy roots, but gus staining was not detected in transgenic gmprp2p- <dig> hairy roots. the transformant pc13p <dig> vector was used as a negative control.figure  <dig>

we used gus staining to select positive roots because the hairy roots from cotyledon were not all positive. for each promoter construct, twenty soybean cotyledons as explants were used to transform. thirty to fifty hairy roots from each transgenic promoter cotyledons were examined for gus staining. the hairy roots of transgenic gmprp2p- <dig> constructs were also detected using pcr. ten gus-positive hairy roots of each transgenic construct were used to measure gus activity. the gus activity results were used for statistical analysis. the 35s promoter drove the highest gus expression level compared to the maximum expression level of each transgenic construct . the gus expression levels in all transgenic gmprp2p- <dig> and 5’-deletion fragments were lower than that in the 50th percentile of the 35s promoter. the gus expression levels for gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> were higher than those of the lowest gus expression level of the 35s promoter. the gus expression levels of most hairy roots for gmprp2p- <dig> were less than the minimum of the 35s promoter, gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig>  the expression activity of gmprp2p- <dig> was extremely weak, and gus staining was not detectable by eyes. the maximum gus expression of gmprp2p- <dig> was higher than that of gmprp2p- <dig>  but the gus expression in the 50th percentile of gmprp2p- <dig> lines was lower than those of gmprp2p- <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
prps are a structural cell wall protein in plants  <cit> . previous studies of prps predominantly focused on gene expression and showed that prps are regulated spatiotemporally during the development of a particular tissue or cell type  <cit> . for example, arabidopsis prp <dig> and prp <dig> were exclusively expressed in roots, and prp <dig> and prp <dig> transcripts were abundant in aerial organs of the plant  <cit> . the rice osprp <dig> expression was mainly present in flowers and accumulated during the late stage of flower development  <cit> . osprp <dig> is expressed preferentially in spikelets and buds, but expression is lower in roots and leaves  <cit> . the cotton ghhyprp <dig> mrna was abundant in petals and 10-dpa ovules but lower in roots and cotyledons and absent in leaves and anthers  <cit> . therefore, prps exhibit an organ-preferential expression pattern to meet the functional and physical requirements of different cell types at different developmental stages.

prp promoters play an important role in the organ-preferential expression pattern of prps. xu et al. reported that ghprp <dig> is a fiber-specific gene, and its promoter directs gus expression only in the trichomes of both transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants  <cit> . the transcript of the alfalfa msprp <dig> gene is expressed in a root-specific manner, and gfp driven by the msprp <dig> promoter is also expressed in the root  <cit> . these studies promote an understanding of the mechanism of organ-preferential expression and provide more promoter options for genetic engineering.

the expression of gmprp <dig> and gmprp <dig> in soybeans is also root-specific  <cit> , but little is known about their promoters and regulatory mechanisms. here, we cloned the gmprp <dig> promoter , which contained many important cis-elements, such as the tatabox, caatbox, myb, myc, abre and root-related elements .

gus staining showed a root-preferential expression in the vegetative stage in the model plant arabidopsis . therefore, gmprp2p- <dig> can harbor some cis-regulatory elements and drive a root-preferential expression. three 5’-deletion fragments  also exhibited root-preferential expression, but the expression levels were significantly different. in our study, we detected that expression level in gmprp2p- <dig> was very low, then when a further deletion the expression level in gmprp2p- <dig> was increased, so we speculated that the suppressor may exist in the promoter fragment from − <dig> to − <dig>  the elements in these deletion regions, which might be responsible for the root specificity and expression, require further research. the study of gmprp2p- <dig> and 5’-deletion fragments in soybean hairy roots showed that the expression patterns were similar to the transgenic arabidopsis , and gus activity was much higher with the gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig> constructs than the other two constructs. the homogeneity in soybean and arabidopsis inferred that the prp <dig> promoter has a similar expression pattern in dicotyledonous plants. the expression level was highest in transgenic arabidopsis with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct, and the range of gus activity varied little between the ten transgenic hairy roots with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct compared with the other constructs . therefore, the gmprp2p- <dig> may be suitable for application.

histochemical staining of gus activity during reproductive growth was also observed in the petiole of green leaves and the split margins in siliques in all promoter constructs except the gmprp2p- <dig>  but the expression level was much lower than in roots. gus staining was not observed in flowers and seeds . gus staining was also detected in the main veins in transgenic lines with the gmprp2p- <dig> construct, which exhibited high expression levels. this result indicated that gmprp <dig> may be expressed in only a few tissues during the reproductive stage and suggested that the promoter may be suitable for genetic engineering with little concern about food safety.

biotic and abiotic stresses also influenced the expression of prps. some evidence indicated that many internal and external factors, such as wounding, fungal infection, circadian rhythm, salt stress, drought stress, and plant regulators, up or down regulates the expression of prps  <cit> . for example, alfalfa msprp <dig> is salt-inducible  <cit> . low temperature induced transcripts of brassica napus bnprp. the bean pvprp <dig> mrna initially decreases then increases in wounded hypocotyls and decreases in the elicitor  <cit> . cotton ghhyprp <dig> transcription in roots was up-regulated by salt stress, cold stress, and osmotic stress and down-regulated by ga <dig>  <cit> . prp gene expression is complicated with positive or negative regulation by stresses. the diversity of the promoter may regulate gene expression in many biological processes. our results showed that the activity of the gmprp2p- <dig> promoter was differentially regulated in response to various abiotic factors. nacl, peg, jm and iaa up-regulated the activity, and aba, ga, and sa down-regulated the activity . the deletion fragments contained stress elements. the − <dig> to − <dig> fragment contained a copper- and salt-responsive element, and − <dig> to − <dig> contained light- and salt-responsive elements. the three 5’-deletion fragments showed a similar response to the stress factors treated with the gmprp2p- <dig>  the region from − <dig> to + <dig> is rich in various biotic and abiotic stress-related cis-elements, including four caatbox, two myb and three myc cis-elements, two arr <dig> cis-elements, one abre cis-element, one wbox and one t/gbox , and this region is a crucial part of the promoter. myb and myc recognition sites may contribute to the activation of drought- and aba-regulated gene expression. abre was identified as an aba-responsive element. wbox was involved in the activation of the erf <dig> gene by wounding, and the t/gboxatpin <dig> element at − <dig> was involved in jasmonate signaling . the above studies demonstrated that the prp <dig> promoter may regulate gene expression on the transcriptional level.

the fine regulation of transgene expression levels is not easy to obtain due to the lack of available promoters. this work provided important insights into the promoter regions that control spatial- and stress-specific expression. this promoter could be widely used as a tool in genetic engineering. soybeans are an important source of nutrition worldwide, but soybeans are generally considered salt- and drought-sensitive. soybean roots also suffer from severe diseases that lead to large annual losses. this promoter is promising for the engineering of resistance traits in soybeans.

CONCLUSIONS
gmprp2p- <dig> is a root-preferential promoter, and the core fragment for root expression might reside between − <dig> and + <dig>  the expression activity for this promoter was lower with shorter promoter sequences from − <dig> to −369 bp, and environmental stresses altered expression activity. gmprp2p- <dig> may be used in soybean genetic engineering to improve root tolerance and resistance in the future.
