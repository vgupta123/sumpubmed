BACKGROUND
adult neural stem cell  maintenance and differentiation is controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. many developmental cues have been shown to operate in the adult nsc niche including wnt  <cit> , sonic hedgehog  <cit> , bone morphogenic protein  <cit>  and notch signaling  <cit> . more recently the modification of histone proteins has been identified as an epigenetic regulator of adult neurogenesis  <cit> . gene expression is epigenetically regulated by enzymatic modifications of histone proteins and changes in histone acetylation by the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases  and histone deacetylases  is considered the more dynamic form of regulation. hdacs catalyze the removal of an acetyl moiety from the ε-amino group of target lysine residues in histone proteins  and histone deacetylation leads to a condensed chromatin structure that is primarily associated with the repression of transcription .

the ability to inhibit hdac activity with small molecule hdac inhibitors  has attracted considerable therapeutic attention. initial interest focused on the application of hdaci as anti-cancer agents and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  is the first hdaci approved by the fda for cancer therapy. more recently, therapeutic interest in hdaci has broadened to non-malignant conditions effecting the nervous system  <cit> . pre-clinical treatment models demonstrate hdaci exert neuroprotective effects and stimulate neurogenesis in traumatic brain injury  and ischemia  <cit> , restore learning and memory in tbi and neurodegenerative mice  <cit> , enhance neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity  <cit>  and exert antidepressant-like effects  <cit> . however these same hdaci have also been reported to both prevent  <cit>  or induce neuronal apoptosis in culture  <cit> , a contradiction that is likely the result of differences in neuronal cell type, the culture conditions employed and the type of hdaci molecule tested.

in an effort to determine the cell specific effects of hdaci on adult neurogenesis, we have investigated the effects of the broad class i and class ii hdac inhibitors saha  and sodium butyrate  on adult mouse nsc biology in vitro. our data indicate these two hdaci exert similar anti-proliferative effects in vitro by blocking g1-to-s phase progression in adult mouse nscs. g <dig> arrest is associated with the up-regulation of expression of cyclin-dependant kinase  inhibitors, the down-regulation of stem/progenitor transcription factors and up-regulation of pro-neural transcription factors in adult nscs. chromatin immunoprecipitation  confirms hdaci directly regulate cdk inhibitor expression in adult mouse nscs. finally, we show hdaci treatment under proliferation culture conditions leads to long-term changes in cell fate in adult nscs induced to differentiate in vitro. combined these data indicate an intrinsic relationship between multipotency, cell cycle progression and hdac activity in adult mouse nscs.

RESULTS
saha and nab inhibit neurosphere formation by adult mouse nscs in vitro
we have examined the effects of two hdac inhibitors, the hydroxamate-based hdac inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  and the short chain fatty acid sodium butyrate . saha and nab are broad class i and class ii hdac inhibitors effective in micromolar  and millimolar  ranges respectively.

we examined the effects of  <dig> μm saha and  <dig> mm nab on adult nscs grown in proliferation culture conditions in vitro. pharmacokinetics indicate  <dig> μm saha treatment falls within the range of clinical use for this compound . western blot analysis of whole cell extracts from adult nscs treated with hdaci for  <dig> hours confirms saha and nab treatment results in an increase in histone  <dig>  acetylation levels when compared to dmso and water vehicle controls .

hdaci treatment was associated with clear differences in adult nsc behavior in culture. hdaci-treated adult nscs exhibited a static behavior when grown in proliferative conditions compared to vehicle-treated controls and failed to produce neurospheres of any significant size or density in cultures . quantitative analysis of adult nscs after 7-days hdaci treatment confirms saha and nab treatment dramatically inhibits the formation of neurospheres  and increase the prevalence of small  cell clusters in culture . hdaci treatment resulted in minor cell death in culture that was most apparent during the first 1- <dig> days of treatment. however, quantitative analysis indicates these toxicity effects were not large-scale - live/dead staining and flow cytometry reveals saha and nab exposure results in a 10% reduction in cell viability compared to vehicle controls after  <dig> hours treatment , a difference that is not statistically significant . rather, the increased prevalence of small cell clusters suggests hdaci treatment results in a modestly toxic inhibition of the normal proliferative behavior of adult nscs in our proliferative culture conditions.

saha and nab block g1- to-s cell cycle progression in adult mouse nscs in vitro
we quantified the effects of hdaci treatment on adult mouse nsc proliferation in vitro by comparing the levels of edu  incorporation in proliferation culture conditions. edu is a nucleoside analog to thymidine and is incorporated into dna during active dna synthesis. adult nscs treated with saha or nab were exposed to edu  overnight  following  <dig> hours hdaci treatment. cell viability was measured by live/dead stain and edu incorporation compared in live cell gated populations. flow cytometry measurement of edu incorporation rates confirmed the addition of either saha or nab significantly inhibited dna synthesis in adult mouse nscs in vitro . saha treatment resulted in a  <dig> -fold reduction  and nab a  <dig> -fold reduction  in edu incorporation rates compared to vehicle controls.

flow cytometry measurement of relative dna content in combination with edu incorporation was used to estimate the effects of saha and nab on cell cycle progression in live cells. we used the dean-jett-fox model  to estimate percentage cell populations in g <dig> phase and g2/m phase of the cell cycle. this analysis revealed equivalent cell cycle effects in nscs treated with saha or nab. saha or nab treatment significantly increased the percentage of cells in g <dig> phase of the cell cycle , as shown in figure 2b. correspondingly, as shown in figure 2c, saha or nab treatment significantly decreased the percentage of cells in g2/m phase . combined these flow cytometry data indicate that the suppression of nsc proliferation by saha and nab results in a g1-to-s phase block in cell cycle progression.

gene expression changes induced by saha and nab treatments vary in fold change but not directionality
genome-wide expression screening indicates hdac inhibition is associated with expression changes in ≈ 2-5% of the genome  <cit> . we measured mrna levels of a cohort of  <dig> genes implicated in cell cycle progression, stem cell maintenance and nsc fate using qrt-pcr. we harvested rna for analysis after  <dig> hours treatment of nscs in proliferation culture conditions with hdaci or vehicle. our analysis revealed widespread changes in gene expression following hdaci exposure . eight out of  <dig> genes analyzed showed increased expression and  <dig> decreased expression when compared to vehicle control. saha and nab treatment induced greater than  <dig> fold expression changes in a majority of the genes tested  and negative  direction from vehicle controls). noticeably, the directionality  fold change of gene expression changes was consistent between the two hdaci treatments when compared to vehicle controls. we speculate this reflects the similar treatment outcome, g <dig> arrest, of saha and nab exposure on adult nscs.

gene expression changes induced by saha and nab are consistent with g <dig> arrest, a reduction in stem/progenitor state and activation of neuronal lineage commitment programs
gene expression changes in hdaci treated adult nscs are consistent with the inhibition of g1-to-s phase cell cycle progression. saha and nab treatment result in increased transcription of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitors p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  and the down-regulation of cyclin dependant kinases cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> . progression through g <dig> and s phase of the cell cycle is dependent on cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> and the activity of these proteins is inhibited by binding of cdk inhibitors p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  we also examined genes with functions associated with stem/progenitor or neuronal cell fate. our analysis revealed saha and nab treatment results in the down-regulation of transcription factors associated with the maintenance of a stem/progenitor cell state and up-regulation of pro-neural transcription factors . the progenitor cell cycle regulator c-myc and stem cell maintaining sry-box factors are downregulated by saha and nab treatment, as are notch effector bhlh transcription factors hes <dig> and hes <dig> . in contrast, mrna levels of pro-neural bhlh transcription factors reveal variable hdaci effects on neuronal lineage commitment genes. neurog <dig> and neurod <dig> are upregulated whereas ascl <dig> is downregulated in adult nscs treated with saha or nab . in summary, qrt-pcr expression data from our gene cohort are consistent with g <dig> arrest accompanied by a reduction of stem/progenitor state and activation of neurog1/neurod <dig> neuronal lineage commitment programs.

+/- fold-changes in gene expression in adult mouse nscs treated with saha or nab were calculated from vehicle controls from ≥  <dig> independent qrt-pcr trials

increased transcription of cdk inhibitors is associated with increased histone acetylation at the proximal promoter in hdaci treated adult mouse nscs
transcription of the cell cycle regulator p <dig> is directly regulated by hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  <cit>  and is re-activated by hdac inhibitors in tumor cells  <cit> . to test whether hdac inhibitor treatment increased histone acetylation levels at the proximal promoter of the p <dig> gene  in adults nscs, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  using antibodies to acetylated lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig> . qpcr analysis reveals saha induces a  <dig> -fold increase and nab a  <dig> -fold increase in h3k <dig> acetylation levels at the p <dig> promoter compared to dmso and water vehicle controls respectively . statistical analysis confirms a significant increase in h3k <dig> acetylation in adult nscs in response to saha  and nab , as well as significant interaction between the immunoprecipitation  antisera  and treatment . we also analyzed h3k <dig> acetylation levels at the proximal promoter of p <dig> . expression of p <dig> is increased in some but not all tumor cells by hdaci and is upregulated in human mesenchymal stem cells by saha treatment  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b, chip revealed a 2-fold increase h3k <dig> acetylation levels at the p <dig> promoter in response to saha treatment that was statistically significant . in contrast, no increase in h3k <dig> acetylation was observed at the p <dig> promoter in response to nab treatment . combined these data indicate transcriptional activation of p <dig> and p <dig> by saha is associated with increased h3k <dig> acetylation at proximal promoter regions, suggesting direct activation of these gene targets. increased p <dig> expression and increased in h3k <dig> acetylation at the p <dig> promoter in nab treated cells suggests nab similarly directly activates p <dig> transcription in adult nscs. in contrast, the absence of significant changes in h3k <dig> acetylation at the p <dig> promoter suggests the involvement of alternative mechanisms, possibly acetylation of non-histone proteins, in nab-mediated increases in p <dig> expression in adult nscs.

treatment of proliferating adult mouse nscs with hdaci leads to changes in differentiated cell fate
inhibition of histone deacetylases promotes the acquisition of neuronal and suppresses glial cell fates in differentiating adult nscs  <cit> . based on these observations, we predicted hdaci treatment of proliferating adult mouse nscs would lead to changes in cell fate in adult nscs induced to differentiate in culture. to test this hypothesis, we developed a 96-well plate immunofluorescence cell fate assay using antibodies to gfap, olig <dig> and neun as general markers of astrocytic, oligodendrocyte and neuronal cell fates. adult nscs were first treated with hdaci for  <dig> hours under proliferation culture conditions and then cultured for  <dig> days under differentiation conditions without hdaci. these assays revealed saha significantly reduced glial  and oligodendrocyte  differentiated cell fate in culture when compared to dmso vehicle controls . however neun immunoassays indicate this did not lead to a compensatory increase in neuronal cell fate . although nab treatment similarly reduces the expression of glial and oligodendrocyte cell markers, these differences were not significant compared to vehicle controls. as was the case with saha, nab treatment did not alter neun expression levels .

in an effort to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for saha-induced suppression of oligodendrocyte cell fate, we measured β-catenin protein levels in hdaci-treated adult nscs by western blot. combined deletion of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in mice is reported to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation through the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which in turn represses olig <dig> expression  <cit> . hence our rationale was that saha inhibits hdac1/ <dig> in proliferating adult nscs leading to increased nuclear localization of β-catenin and longer-term suppression of oligodendrocyte fates. however, western blots  of adult nscs treated with hdaci under proliferation conditions do not reveal significant changes in β-catenin nuclear localization in treated cells . fold-changes of β-catenin nuclear protein levels normalized to laminin a/c reveal marginal opposing +/- effects of saha  and nab  treatment, indicating saha modulates cell fate via mechanisms independent of increased β-catenin stabilization.

discussion
in this study we demonstrate the broad class i and class ii histone deacetylase inhibitors saha and nab block adult nsc proliferation in vitro by blocking g1-to-s progression. hdaci induced cell cycle blockade is accompanied by transcriptional changes consistent with g <dig> arrest, a reduction of stem/progenitor cell state and activation of neuronal lineage commitment programs in adult nscs. furthermore, hdaci treatment of adult nscs in proliferation culture conditions leads to longer-term changes in cell fate when cells are induced to differentiate in culture.

saha and nab block g1-to-s cell cycle progression in adult nscs and activate cdk inhibitor expression
we have shown saha and nab treatment inhibits adult nsc proliferation in vitro by arresting cells in g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. g <dig> arrest induced by saha or nab treatment has been reported in fibroblasts  <cit> , vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit>  and numerous tumor cell types . in many of these contexts, g <dig> arrest is associated with increased expression of p <dig>  <cit>  indicating the anti-proliferative effects of saha and nab are, in part, mediated by changes in the expression of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitors.

the functional link between hdac-mediated regulation of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor activity and cell cycle progression is supported by a number of genetic studies targeting hdac genes in mice. targeted deletion of hdac <dig> in mice results in embryonic lethality associated with severe reductions in embryonic stem cell proliferation and increased p <dig> and p <dig> expression in null mutant embryos  <cit> . furthermore, disruption of the p <dig> gene  rescues the proliferation phenotype of hdac1-/- mouse embryonic stem cells  and chromatin immunoprecipitations confirm the presence of hdac <dig> at the p <dig> promoter  <cit> . similarly, combined deletion of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in primary fibroblasts and b-cells results in a strong g <dig> cell cycle block that is accompanied by increased p <dig> and p <dig> transcription  <cit> , and loss of hdac1/ <dig> catalytic activity results in g <dig> arrest and up-regulation of p <dig> in primary and oncogenic-transformed embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> . taken together these studies indicate hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> regulate g1-to-s cell cycle progression in multiple cell types by normally repressing the expression of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor genes, in particular through transcriptional repression of p <dig> 

in agreement with this, our data reveal saha and nab upregulated p <dig> mrna expression in adult mouse nscs and that transcriptional activation is associated with increased h3k <dig> acetylation at the proximal promoter region of the p <dig> gene. this data indicates saha and nab directly increases the acetylation of associated chromatin histone residues to upregulate p <dig> transcription in adult nscs in vitro, a finding that implies class i and/or class ii hdac activity directly represses p <dig> gene transcription in adult nscs to regulate cell proliferation. similarly our data demonstrates saha and nab upregulated p <dig> mrna expression in adult nscs. however, p <dig> transcriptional activation is associated with increased h3k <dig> acetylation at the gene's proximal promoter region of saha but not nab treated adult nscs. this suggests hdac activity inhibited by saha but not nab directly represses p <dig> transcription in adult nscs to regulate cell proliferation. the fact that p <dig> mrna levels are upregulated by nab treatment irrespective of h3k <dig> acetylation changes suggests indirect nab effects on p <dig> transcription in adult nscs. we speculate that one of the various acetylated non-histone proteins such as p <dig> may provide the linkage between hdaci and p <dig> repression  <cit> .

saha and nab treatment suppresses stem/progenitor and activates neuronal lineage commitment programs in adult nscs
our expression data demonstrates saha and nab treatment results in significant changes in gene transcription, changes that differed in magnitude but not directionality from vehicle controls reflecting the similar treatment outcomes of the two hdaci. the three signaling pathways represented within our gene cohort, sonic hedgehog  <cit> , wnt/β-catenin  <cit>  and notch  <cit>  signaling are known to combine to regulate nsc proliferation and neurogenesis in adult rodents. thus the widespread changes in gene expression indicate hdac inhibitors alter the output of each of the major regulatory pathways identified in adult nscs. and since these pathways also control subsequent cell fate selection, it was not surprising that we observed alterations in cell markers such as olig <dig> when cells were induced to differentiate.

overall, the expression data demonstrated hdaci treatment downregulates transcription factors implicated in the maintenance of stem/progenitor cell states and upregulates transcription factors that drive neuronal lineage commitment and differentiation. however, there are a few exceptions that merit discussion. these are the downregulation of pro-neural bhlh factor ascl <dig> and the upregulation of shh and gli <dig> mrnas. ascl <dig> downregulation could result indirectly through the modulation of upstream activators such as tlx  <cit> . chip data suggests direct hdaci effects at the shh loci account for the increase in transcription of shh and its target gli <dig> . the fact that shh-gli <dig> upregulation is accompanied by g <dig> arrest in our study suggests the mitogenic effects of shh in adult nscs  <cit>  require normal hdac function.

in addition to activating cell lineage commitment programs  <cit> , hdaci also promote the re-setting of multipotency in terminally differentiated cell lineages by increasing induced pluripotent stem cell  re-programming efficiency  <cit> . somatic cell re-programming reactivates expression of nanog, a homeobox transcription factor necessary for maintaining multipotency in embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . in es cells, msin3a-hdac complex at the nanog promoter acts to positively regulate nanog expression under proliferating conditions and hdac inhibition by tsa downregulates nanog expression  <cit> , a finding that is analogous to saha and nab repression of multipotent factors in our adult mouse nsc cultures.

in our study both saha and nab downregulate the expression of the stem cell maintaining factor sox <dig> in adult mouse nscs. conditional gene deletion in mice reveals sox <dig> is negatively regulated by hdac <dig> in adult neuroblasts and that sox <dig> repression is necessary for adult neurogenesis - hdac2-/- neuroblasts ectopically maintain sox <dig> expression, fail to mature into neurons and ultimately die of apoptosis  <cit> . taking our data into consideration, hdac regulation of sox <dig> expression in adult nsc lineage progression appears to be biphasic: in the first phase, class i and/or class ii hdac activity is required to maintain sox <dig> expression and the maintenance of stem/progenitor programs in self-renewing nscs; in the second phase, hdac <dig> functions to downregulate sox <dig> in neuroblasts and permit the full activation of neuronal differentiation programs.

saha treatment leads to cell fate changes in differentiated adult nscs
our cell fate analysis revealed saha treatment of adult nscs under proliferation culture conditions lead to the long-term suppression of glial and oligodendrocyte cell fate markers gfap and olig <dig> in cells induced to differentiate. using olig1-cre and floxed hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> mice, ye et al.  showed combined deletion of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation by repressing olig <dig> expression. this effect was mediated by the stabilization  and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which in turn negatively regulates oligodendrocyte development by repressing olig <dig> expression  <cit> . these authors identified the transcription factor tcf7l2/tcf <dig> as a co-effector with β-catenin in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and speculate hdac1/ <dig> competition with β-catenin for tcf7l <dig> interaction converts tcf7l <dig> from a repressor to an activator of oligodendrocyte differentiation. accordingly, we hypothesized hdaci induced increases in β-catenin stabilization and nuclear localization accounted for olig <dig> suppression in our cell fate assays. however western blot analysis failed to detect significant differences in nuclear protein levels of β-catenin in adult mouse nscs treated with hdaci under proliferation culture conditions. we speculate hdaci effects on other targets offset this competitive interaction. one possible candidate is hdac <dig>  a class iib hdac. hdac <dig> deacetylates β-catenin at lysine  <dig>  to reduce β-catenin phosphorylation and promote β-catenin nuclear localization and c-myc induction  <cit> . thus inhibition of hdac1/ <dig> and hdac <dig> activity has the capacity to promote opposing effects on β-catenin stability and nuclear localization by increasing stability  via inhibition of hdac1/ <dig> as well as decreasing stability and nuclear localization as a result of increased lys <dig> acetylation and phosphorylation. indeed differential sensitivities of hdac1/ <dig> and hdac <dig> to saha and nab inhibition might underlie the different +/- fold-changes in β-catenin nuclear localization compared to vehicle controls). the fact that the effects of hdaci are consistent with anti-proliferative responses to pharmacological and genetic interventions targeting the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in adult nscs  <cit>  suggests the net effect of these molecules is to inhibit rather than activate this signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the broad class i and class ii hdac inhibitors saha and nab blocked g1-to-s phase progression in proliferating adult nscs in vitro. gene expression changes induced by saha and nab treatment in adult nscs vary in fold change but not directionality, consistent with the comparable treatment outcomes of g <dig> arrest. in addition, the +/- direction of gene changes induced by saha and nab treatment is consistent with g <dig> arrest accompanied by a reduction of stem/progenitor state and activation of neuronal lineage commitment programs. saha and nab treatment induces increases in the transcription of cdk inhibitors p <dig> and p <dig> in adult nscs which was associated with elevated h3k <dig> acetylation levels at proximal promoter regions. this association is consistent with direct saha and nab effects on cell cycle arrest genes in adult nscs, in common with widely reported hdaci induced growth arrest in normal and transformed cells  <cit> . finally, we show hdaci treatment under proliferation culture conditions leads to long-term changes in cell fate in adult nscs induced to differentiate in vitro.
