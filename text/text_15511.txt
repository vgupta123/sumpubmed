BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing  has enabled genome-wide investigation of chromatin features and epigenetic modifications within the non-coding regions of mammalian genomes in high resolution  <cit> . chip-seq provides the opportunity to characterise and begin to understand on a genome-wide scale how genes are regulated in a cell-type specific manner by sequence-specific dna-binding transcription factors . however, identifying regulatory regions within the genome and linking these regions to the regulation of specific genes remains a challenge.

distal regulatory elements have been identified which regulate gene transcription from several kilobases  away and have even been found to regulate genes located on separate chromosomes  <cit> . functional characterisation of these regulatory elements can be done by identifying bound tfs and investigating whether or not they act as enhancers, increasing transcription of a gene in a position and orientation independent manner. chip-seq analysis for several tfs has revealed a significant fraction  of the binding sites for most tfs are located in intergenic regions >10 kb from transcription start sites  of annotated genes  <cit> . in addition, enhancer regions are associated with significant epigenetic differences between cell types, while gene promoters show more uniform modifications across different cell types  <cit> . these findings suggest that enhancers, which can be located at great distances from the genes they regulate, play a larger role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression than the sequences proximal to gene promoters. moreover, mutations in dna sequences of distant-acting enhancers contribute to various diseases  <cit> , further stressing their importance in regulating gene expression.

prior to the availability of chip-seq and chip-chip data, computational approaches based solely on genomic sequences were used to identify enhancer regions. initially these approaches compared the genomic sequence with tf binding motifs represented by position specific scoring matrices  from transfac  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit> . tf motif clustering and comparative genomics improved the predictive power of these approaches  <cit> . in addition, intergenic regions with high sequence conservation between human and fugu or ultra-conserved regions between human-mouse-rat  are predictive of regulatory regions involved in conserved processes such as embryonic development  <cit> . as many enhancer regions regulate the expression of genes in a tissue-specific manner and can be located at great distances from the genes they regulate, the link between cell-type and active enhancers is lacking in purely sequenced based approaches. using chip-seq approaches several different methods of identifying enhancers have been applied including: enrichment of mono-methylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and depletion of tri-methylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>   <cit> , binding of the co-activator p <dig>   <cit> , intergenic rnapii  phosphorylated at serine  <dig> on the c-terminal domain   <cit> , multiple transcription factor bound loci   <cit> , and a combination of these features  <cit>  have been used to identify enhancers within a target cell type. additional chromatin associated proteins have been identified at enhancers including members of the mediator  and cohesin  complexes  <cit> .

these different approaches show variable success at predicting enhancers with in vivo activity. for example, 47%  of human genomic regions predicted by sequence conservation were confirmed as enhancers in a transgenic mouse assay  <cit> . the prediction was significantly enhanced to 87%  when using only p <dig> high throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  binding sites from mouse forebrain, midbrain and limb cells  <cit> . heintzman et al. developed a motif-independent model for identifying and distinguishing promoters and enhancers using histone modification profiles  <cit> . they observed h3k4me <dig> enrichment and h3k4me <dig> depletion at p <dig> binding sites and then used this signature to identify putative enhancers in  <dig> human cell lines. their enhancer predictions were supported by dnase i hypersensitivity, binding of p <dig>  or binding of the mediator protein med <dig>  <dig> % of the time. taking the mtl approach, using overlapping regions of three major pluripotency tfs, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, chen et al.  <dig> generated enhancer candidates in mouse embryonic stem  cells and tested  <dig> of these regions for enhancer activity  <cit> . all  <dig> regions displayed es cell specific enhancer activity suggesting the mtl approach is highly predictive of functional enhancer regions. however, enhancer activities depend on the specific tfs occupying the mtl, as all  <dig> co-myc associated mtl were found to have little or no enhancer activity  <cit> . in addition, the mtl approach requires prior knowledge of relevant regulatory tfs and the generation of unique chip-seq data sets for each cell type.

although previous approaches showed promising performance, a potential issue with non-integrated approaches is that each marker may be an incomplete representation of the relevant enhancers in a particular cell type. for example, although sequence conservation is frequently used to identify regulatory elements, ultra-conservation has been reported to identify only a small subset of developmentally related enhancers, specifically, those involved in development of the nervous system  <cit> . furthermore, there is variation in the degree of conservation at enhancers; a large population of validated heart enhancers are less deeply conserved in vertebrate evolution  <cit> . although found at enhancer regions in different cell types, p <dig> is reported to mark only a subset of enhancers in heart  <cit> . histone modifications perhaps represent a more widely applicable enhancer signature, though by inspection they appear to mark the genome in a broad manner. the incomplete representation of enhancers by each feature and the broad signatures associated with histone modifications emphasize the need to integrate these features within the same cell type and evaluate their importance for enhancer prediction.

in this study we used  <dig> public high throughput mouse es cell rna-seq and chip-seq datasets, as well as  <dig> genomic features to identify the characteristics most predictive of enhancers. we applied multinomial logistic regression with lasso regularization  <cit>  to identify key enhancer signatures, predict functional enhancers, and subsequently identify motif enrichment in predicted enhancers. through an initial assessment of enhancer markers, we highlight the importance of feature selection. furthermore, lasso regularization ranked the predictability of signatures necessary for enhancer classification with p <dig> being the most predictive followed by h3k4me <dig> and med <dig>  predicted enhancers showed significant association with mtl indicating functionality and identified previously validated enhancers. in addition, a supervised motif enrichment test on putative enhancer regions using clover  <cit>  confirmed our ability to identify known tfs centrally involved in es cell transcriptional regulatory networks.

RESULTS
feature selection improves enhancer prediction
to identify and validate enhancer regions active in mouse es cells we used chip-seq data sets from mouse es cells including:  <dig> transcription factors   <cit> ,  <dig> histone modifications  <cit> ,  <dig> polymerase occupancy  <cit> , and  <dig> chromatin associated proteins  <cit>  . in addition to these chip-seq data sets, genomic features including cpg islands, gc content, snp, repeat regions, and phastcons most conserved regions  <cit>  were also incorporated in the model. to prevent cell type specificity in the features used for enhancer identification, only histone modifications and ubiquitously expressed non-tf features were evaluated as enhancer markers. the tf data sets were used for either training or validation purposes. as 25/ <dig> regions co-bound by the pluripotency transcription factors oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog  in chip-seq data were shown to have enhancer activity  <cit> , co-osn regions were used as the enhancer positive training set . in contrast, 8/ <dig> regions co-bound by myc and mycn  had limited or no enhancer activity  <cit> . as co-myc regions showed a strong tendency to be located close to annotated tsss  we termed this enhancer negative training set promoter-like . we also included an “unknown” training set of  <dig> regions randomly drawn from non co-osn and non co-myc regions of the genome.

in our model we classified 1 kb genomic bins into  <dig> categories: enhancer positive , promoter-like  and unknown. as multiple combinations of features have been used to predict enhancers, we performed naive bayes classifications using various combinations of features. assessment of the model was carried out using four indices, area under curve , precision, modified precision, and recall , using  <dig> fold cross validation on the training set data . the classifiers were ranked by the average ranking of the four indices. we used this analysis to make a number of observations about the predictive value of various markers of enhancers within the context of other possible features. first, we noted that the naive bayes classifier using all features  does not generate the best classification. such classification bias can be caused by feature redundancy and introduction of noise by non-informative features. second, although p <dig> is extensively used to identify enhancers and has the highest modified precision in combination with cpg islands, the recall is low which is likely caused by the incomplete representation of enhancers by p <dig> . classifiers using previous markers, such as h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> as well as rnapii-ser <dig> and rna, also performed poorly . third, adding gc content, an informative genomic feature, improves precision and recall . fourth, the recall of enhancers can be over  <dig> percent with informative features . finally, we observed that although sequence conservation has been previously used to predict enhancers, adding most conserved regions into feature combinations can worsen the model prediction , which is likely due to non-exclusive representation of enhancers in conserved regions.

ranking enhancer signatures
the naive bayes classification approach revealed the importance of feature selection and allowed us to determine the most appropriate combination of features for optimal enhancer identification, however, each feature is assumed to contribute independently. as some features might be partially or fully redundant  and some may add no or little predictive value, we modified our approach and used a lasso regularized multinomial logistic regression model  <cit>  to assess features systematically and obtain their rank contributions to the classification of enhancers. lasso regularization  <cit>  introduces a lambda penalty factor to shrink feature weights, so uninformative or redundant features can be assigned zero weights and not impact classification. furthermore, regression models can detect and down-weight highly correlated  features. feature weights corresponding to specific log lambda values for each category are shown in figure 2a. by increasing the penalty parameter lambda, weights of less informative features for each category shrink to zero; whereas weights of informative features remain non-zero. through lasso regularization we identified the most positively predictive features for enh regions, p <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  which have been used for enhancer prediction in other studies  <cit> . the component of the mediator complex, med <dig>  and the cohesion loading factor, nipbl, are ranked third and fourth. both have been shown to associate with enhancers involved in chromatin looping to promoter regions  <cit> . features that best categorize prl regions are cpg islands, h3k4me <dig>  g + c percent and rnapii-ser <dig> all in agreement with promoter characteristics. ten features were selected to classify the 1 kb bins into three categories in our model .

classified enhancer and promoter-like candidates
a total of  <dig> 1 kb regions were predicted to be enh,  <dig> were predicted to be prl, and  <dig> regions were predicted as unknown using the lasso regularized model . of the  <dig> co-osn training regions  <dig> were classified as enh in the model, while  <dig> of  <dig> co-myc training regions were classified as prl. all luciferase-validated enhancer positive regions from chen et al.  <dig>  <cit>  are predicted positive whereas, all luciferase-validated enhancer negative regions are predicted prl in our model. as enh candidates are ranked by probability, more stringent thresholds can be applied to gain higher confidence enhancer candidates. applying a stringent threshold of greater than  <dig>  probability,  <dig> of  <dig> previously validated enhancer regions were predicted enh and  <dig> of  <dig> previously identified negative regions were predicted prl. in addition, the log probabilities of putative enhancer candidates are significantly correlated  to an independent luciferase assay data set in which  <dig> regions bound by chd <dig> were tested for enhancer activity  <cit> . a heatmap of the top  <dig> enh and prl candidates demonstrates that the enh and prl signature features are separated with hierarchical clustering except for h3k4me <dig>  the lowest ranked feature in the prl category . the probability and modeling approach, in contrast to an overlapping peak approach, allows variations in features within the predicted category.

we examined the distribution of enh and prl candidates in the genome and found that high probability  enh and prl candidates are distributed relative to annotated genes similarly to the training data . as expected more of the top enh candidates are located in intergenic regions  than top prl candidates, which more frequently overlap tsss. to examine the distribution of enh and prl candidates more specifically with respect to tsss we calculated the distance to the closest tss for each candidate. enh candidates tend to be further away from tsss compared to prl candidates . distributions of the entire set of the three categories are provided in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

enhancer and promoter-like candidates coordinately regulate gene expression
to assess the regulatory potential of the enh and prl candidates in es cells, we assigned candidates to the closest gene tsss and compared the es cell gene expression distribution among subsets of genes: associated with both enh and prl, either prl or enh only, and genes without an associated enh or prl candidate  . distributions of gene expression in all categories containing an enh or prl candidate are significantly higher than those with no associated candidate. while we found that prl alone conferred significantly higher expression than enh alone , enh&prl genes showed significantly higher expression than that of prl-only genes . these findings suggest that enh and prl candidates coordinately regulate transcription of a subset of target genes in mouse es cells, while other genes are regulated solely by prl signatures. it is important to note that enh candidates are expected to be more difficult to assign to the correct gene as they are often located in intergenic regions and may in fact not regulate the closest gene in the linear genome. regardless, we observe the presence of a candidate enhancer is associated with increased levels of expression in addition to the presence of a promoter candidate.

short intergenic transcripts have been found associated with enhancers in neurons  <cit> , while the human β-globin distal locus control region  is associated with long, cell cycle-regulated intergenic transcripts  <cit> . we investigated the overlap between lincrnas  identified in es cells and our enh and prl categories. we found that only  <dig> out of  <dig> lincrnas  from guttman et al.  <dig>  <cit>  overlapped predicted enh regions and only  <dig>  overlapped high probability enh candidates . a larger proportion overlapped prl regions,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> lincrnas overlapped the total and top  prl candidates, respectively. in addition, the proximity of enh candidates to protein coding transcripts is significantly greater than the proximity to these lincrnas . the enhancer associated transcripts identified by kim et al.  <dig>  <cit>  are generally short, <2 kb in length, and lincrnas were defined as at least 5 kb in length. these may therefore represent functionally different types of intergenic non-coding transcripts.

in order to probe the functional significance of the genes regulated by enh or prl, we investigated functional enrichment in these categories using david  <cit>  followed by clustering of functions with significant numbers of shared genes using enrichment map  <cit> . the enh set is significantly enriched with dna binding, transcription regulating activities and stem cell development , and the genes include several tfs involved in es cell transcriptional regulation: oct <dig>  myc, mycn, sox <dig>  esrrb, phc <dig> and zic <dig> . in contrast the prl candidates are enriched with a wide variety of molecular functions in addition to dna binding, such as rna binding and processing, translation, and chromatin organization  indicating these genes are associated with more basal cellular functions. this indicates that, in addition to promoters, enh candidates play a significant role in regulating the es cell transcriptional program to maintain pluripotency.

enhancer candidates are bound by multiple transcription factors in es cells
as we initially trained our classifier based on the binding of either co-osn  or co-myc , we wanted to determine whether we also identified regions bound by additional tfs. single tf binding sites are found at many locations in the genome while mtl are more limited and have been shown to be associated with increased regulatory activity  <cit> . we examined the association of our enh and prl candidates with es cell-expressed tfs using  <dig> chip-seq data sets . we found that the enh candidates were most highly and significantly enriched with mtl  compared to both the prl and unknown categories, and overall genomic bins . of the  <dig> top enh candidate regions ,  <dig> of these overlapped with at least one of the  <dig> tf binding sites. it is noteworthy that although enh candidates tend to be further away from tsss compared to prl candidates, the enh set is significantly more enriched in mtl than the prl set. this is in agreement with the observation that a significant proportion of individual tf bound regions are located within the intergenic regions of the genome  <cit> . we also investigated the effect of increasing the enhancer probability threshold on the proportion overlapping mtl . with increasing enh probability we found an increase in the proportion of candidates associated with more bound tfs. this significant association of enh candidates with mtl further supports the regulatory functionality of these regions.

es cell enhancer candidates
we next looked at how well the model predicts previously identified mouse es cell enhancer regions associated with mediator and cohesin proteins and shown to form chromatin loops with the nearby gene tsss  <cit> . these tissue-specific promoter-interacting enhancer regions upstream of oct <dig> nanogphc <dig> and lefty <dig> are all predicted enh with probabilities greater than  <dig>  . moreover, several significant tf binding peaks overlap with these enhancers. although the aligned tf peaks at the oct <dig> upstream enhancer are located at the boundary of two 1 kb genome bins, our model predicted both sides with high probability . in addition to the lefty <dig> promoter-interacting enhancer, we identified novel contiguous enhancer regions over 3–5 kb upstream of lefty <dig> .

we also identified high probability enh candidates surrounding the sox <dig> gene and around 100 kb downstream . in addition to the role sox <dig> plays in regulating the transcriptional program in es cells, sox <dig> is also a key neurodevelopmental gene, and multiple sox <dig> enhancers have been identified in various different cell types ranging from es to neural precursor and lens epithelial cells  <cit> . the evolutionary conserved srr <dig> enhancer, 4 kb upstream of sox <dig>  has been shown to enhance the expression of a reporter gene by  <dig> fold in es cells and overlaps a high confidence enh candidate   <cit> , while the second validated enhancer 4 kb downstream of sox <dig>  srr <dig>  overlaps partially with a lower confidence enh . in addition to these previously validated enhancers, we identified a cluster of eight high confidence enhancers downstream of sox <dig> overlapping multiple tf peaks as well as p <dig> and med <dig> peaks. notably, the furthest downstream enhancer region is ranked in the top  <dig> with an enh probability of  <dig>  located between the sox <dig> gene and the enhancer cluster is a refseq transcript gm3143m which is not expressed in es cells and therefore unlikely to be regulated by the cluster of eight high confidence enhancers. we also noted an expressed lincrna immediately downstream of the distal enhancer cluster .

we further investigated other high probability enhancer clusters and identified an enhancer dense region upstream of the mir- <dig> microrna cluster. the mir- <dig> cluster, though not sufficient to maintain es cell pluripotency alone, inhibits es cell differentiation when over-expressed  <cit> . four of the seven identified high probability enh regions  upstream of mir- <dig> overlap with mtl . interestingly, although overlaps of putative enhancers with co-myc regions are rare , two enh candidates  contain myc and mycn binding peaks.

in addition to enh candidates overlapping co-osn sites, we have also identified several putative enhancers with limited osn occupancy including those shown surrounding tet1/u6zic <dig>  and c <dig> . we identified seven contiguous enhancers around the u <dig> small nuclear rna, upstream of tet <dig> which overlap tf bound regions as well as a chd <dig> bound region . tet <dig> modifies methylated cytosine  by hydroxylation, generating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine   <cit> , potentially the first step in dna demethylation  <cit> , and is involved in regulating the lineage potential of es cells  <cit> . we identified two adjacent prl candidates upstream of the annotated mouse gene which overlap the aligned human tet <dig> gene . the upstream enhancer  of the zic <dig> gene showed nine-fold up-regulation of luciferase activity compared to a minimal oct <dig> promoter  <cit> , and the higher probability enhancer downstream , overlapping one e2f <dig> and one chd <dig> peak, has not been investigated . furthermore, the putative enhancer 10 kb upstream of c <dig> overlaps only with a chd <dig> peak .

tf motif enrichment at es cell enhancer candidates
although our modeling approach was trained using co-osn regions, the prediction is not limited to sites bound by these tfs. in fact, of the  <dig> regions with enhancer probability ≥ <dig> ,  <dig> overlap with co-osn regions,  <dig> overlap with at least  <dig> of the other  <dig> tfs,  <dig> of which are not co-osn. overall  <dig> regions are not associated with oct <dig>  sox <dig> or nanog, and  <dig> of our enh candidates were not associated with any of the  <dig> tfs. as a number of our enh candidates do not overlap a region bound by any of the  <dig> tfs for which chip-seq data is available in es cells, we next investigated which tfs may be binding these regions.

to this end we carried out a supervised motif analysis using the clover algorithm  <cit>  . as validation of this approach, we detected motif enrichment for critical regulatory es cell-expressed tfs including: klf <dig>  sox <dig>  oct <dig>  esrrb and stat <dig>  all ranked in the top  <dig> enriched motifs. the pssm for nanog was not included in the query set  and as a result was not identified as enriched. we also detected significant enrichment in motifs for several other es cell-expressed tfs including: sp <dig>  sox <dig>  zic <dig>  zic <dig>  rarα, nrf <dig>  and tead <dig>  the top motif enrichment candidate, sp <dig>  is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor essential for early embryonic development  <cit> . zic <dig>  ranks in the top 27% of absolute expression in mouse es cells, is required for maintenance of pluripotency  <cit> , and directly activates nanog <cit> . interestingly the high probability enhancer candidate upstream of zic <dig> is bound by nanog, suggesting nanog also directly regulates zic <dig>  nrf <dig>  encoded by nfe2l <dig> gene, acts as a master regulator of the antioxidant response, and its deficiency results in embryonic lethality and severe oxidative stress  <cit> . tead <dig> binding sites have been shown to enhance reporter gene transcription in es cells and 2-cell embryos  <cit> . although retinoic acid treatment of es cells is associated with neuronal differentiation, rar is expressed in es cells and chip-chip revealed  <dig> rar target loci in es cells, most of which are specific to es cells  <cit> . we also identified motif enrichment for tfs with limited or no expression in es cells. these tfs play essential roles in embryonic development and early differentiation. specifically, sox <dig>  zic <dig> and nr4a <dig> play central regulatory roles for neural development and neural protection  <cit> . this suggests that either another active protein family member may have a very similar pssm  or a proportion of our enhancers are poised for regulating gene expression during development  <cit> .

the motifs of the listed tfs are significantly enriched with p <  <dig>  in putative enhancer regions compared to random sequences drawn from prl set, chr <dig> and promoter 5 kb regions using the clover algorithm  <cit>  with tf binding matrices reported in pssm column raw scores from clover algorithm are reported. “max enh prob” column lists the maximum probabilities of enhancers if at least one enh is closest to the tss of the corresponding gene. probabilities greater than  <dig>  are underlined. rpkm column reports the absolute gene expression of the tf in mouse es cells. † several putative enhancer located 50 kb downstream of klf <dig> are categorized to another non protein-coding transcript. ‘#’ sign denotes the tfs with chip-seq datasets in mouse es cells.

to verify binding of transcription factors at identified motifs we used klf <dig>  esrrb, and stat <dig> chip-seq data from chen et al.  <dig>  <cit> . we compared the overlap of our high probability enh regions to tf enriched regions . we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> high probability enhancers  contained klf <dig>  esrrb or stat <dig> enriched regions, respectively  confirming the motif enrichment results for these transcription factors.

identified enhancers are mainly active and cell type specific
recent studies identified different classes of enhancers marked by h3k4me <dig> in es cells; enhancer regions also marked by h3k27ac were associated with increased gene activity in es cells and termed active, while regions marked by h3k27me <dig> were associated with early developmental genes and termed poised in es cells  <cit> . in addition to these active and poised enhancers, another recent study proposed an intermediate category of enhancers marked by h3k4me <dig> but lacking h3k27ac and h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . we found significant overlap between enh candidates  from our model and the distal h3k27ac mark in es cells . we found that  <dig> of our  <dig> predicted enh regions fell into the active category while  <dig> and  <dig> fell into the intermediate and poised categories, respectively. the top enh candidates were significantly enriched in h3k27ac compared to the training set of co-osn regions indicating the advantage of the model in identifying active enhancers  . we also increased the overlap to the h3k27ac regions compared to the training data suggesting again that we have identified additional active enhancers not contained in the training data. in addition, these candidates are significantly less associated with the repressive h3k27me <dig> mark compared to co-osn regions . this significant association with the h3k27ac suggests our modeling preferentially identifies active rather than poised enhancer regions. as h3k27ac overlaps with our enh candidates and was not included in our initial model we next investigated whether or not this mark is predictive of enh regions. introducing h3k27ac into our model showed positive weighting of h3k27ac for prl rather than enh indicating that h3k27ac is a predictor of prl rather than enh .

to further investigate the cell type-specific regulatory potential of our identified es cell enh candidates, we compared distal h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> marks from various cell types to our enh candidates . we found significantly greater enh overlap to distal h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> in es cells compared to the differentiated cells indicating a significant proportion of our enh candidates are specific to es cells . we observed an increase in the overlap to h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> in es cells, and a decrease in the overlap in the differentiated cell types for the high probability enh set compared to all enh .

discussion
we present a systematic approach to assess discriminative features for enhancer identification in mouse es cells. we initially established the importance of feature selection using a naive bayes classifier and subsequently used lasso regularized multinomial logistic regression to systematically rank the feature weights. in our model we identified  <dig> key signatures for distinguishing enhancer regions from promoter-like regions and the rest of the genome. the top signatures predictive of enhancers are p <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  med <dig>  and nipbl whereas we identified cpg islands, rnapii-ser <dig>  ctcf, gc percent and h3k4me <dig> as the top signatures for promoter identification. our model predicts previously validated enhancers as well as novel enhancers around oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, phc <dig>  lefty <dig>  lefty <dig>  mir <dig>  tet <dig>  and zic <dig>  all of which have important regulatory roles in regulating es cell pluripotency. in summary, our predicted enhancers appear to regulate the expression of es cell-expressed genes, coordinately with predicted promoters, are significantly associated with mtl compared to both prl and unknown regions, enriched in motifs for pluripotency associated tfs and marked by tissue-specific chromatin modifications .

the features used in our model for enhancer identification are p <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  med <dig> and nipbl, ranked in that order. we identified p <dig> as the top ranked enhancer signature; in addition p <dig> is a strong negative predictor for the unknown regions of the genome in our model. in es cells p <dig> has been identified as a major h3k <dig> acetyltransferase  <cit> ; therefore, it is not surprising that we found a high degree of overlap between our enh candidate regions and h3k27ac. although p <dig>  when used as the sole enh feature, ranked highly with respect to precision of enhancer identification the ability to recall enhancers in the training data was poor, in agreement with p <dig> being an incomplete representation of enhancers  <cit> . the incorporation of cbp, also linked to h3k27ac in es cells, into the model may allow for improved enhancer identification  <cit> . h3k4me <dig>  ranked second for enhancer identification, has been used in several other studies to identify enhancer regions, though we find it performs quite poorly when used as the only enhancer feature . this is perhaps due to the broader regions associated with h3k4me <dig> compared to the more discrete peaks of p <dig> or med <dig> 

med <dig> and nipbl are the third and fourth most predictive features for enhancer identification. med <dig> is part of the mediator complex and nipbl is associated with cohesin complex loading; many components of these complexes have recently been identified to co-occupy enhancers in mouse es cells  <cit> . it is somewhat surprising that med <dig> and nipbl stand out among the other mediator and cohesin components included in the model  as peaks of all five are apparent at key enhancers  <cit> . the mediator complex is recruited by many tfs and acts as a bridge to the rnapii preinitiation complex  <cit> . med <dig> is part of the core mediator module while med <dig> is part of the mediator kinase module  <cit> . the mediator core, when associated with the kinase module has been implicated as a transcriptional repressor; however, med <dig> has been shown to be required for transcriptional activation by specific transcription factors, including nanog  <cit> . the drosophila homologue of nipbl  has been shown to support enhancer-promoter communication between distant enhancers  <cit> . members of the cohesin complex, smc1a and smc <dig>  in addition to being associated with enhancer regions, are also found at ctcf occupied regions while the cohesin loading factor nipbl is less associated with ctcf  <cit> . ctcf is predictive of prl in our model, which would account for smc1a and smc <dig> being less discriminatory of enh and prl than nipbl.

as individual features are associated with enhancers and promoters to various degrees, the modeling approach is important to discriminate their relative contribution to enhancers and promoters. the importance of feature extraction when using chromatin signatures has been demonstrated previously using an artificial neural network for enhancer prediction in human es cells  <cit> . in addition, models integrating multiple data sources, including histone modification chip-seq data, have been shown to successfully improve cell type-specific tf binding site prediction  <cit> . these studies used all histone modification chip-seq data available for either human or mouse es cells to predict tf binding sites without assessing the predictive value of each feature. narlikar et al.  <dig> employed lasso regularization to identify heart-specific enhancers by using tf binding specificities from pssms as features  <cit> , our approach in contrast used non-tf chromatin-associated features from chip-seq data to identify enhancers. other unsupervised approaches have been used to systematically annotate various functional elements in the human genome using chromatin features  <cit>  while our approach focused specifically on enhancer identification.

in using minimal features  and avoiding the use of cell-type specific tf signatures in the modeling we have retained the potential to apply this model to other cell types. the features used  are genomic sequence features, ubiquitously expressed proteins, and histone modifications which we expect mark enhancers and promoters in all cell types. in fact, p <dig> has been used to identify enhancers in several different cells types. in contrast to methods identifying enhancers using p <dig>  alone or in combination with h3k4me <dig>  in es cells we found that our enhancer candidates overlapped the active h3k27ac mark but not the repressive h3k27me <dig> mark  <cit> . this significant association with h3k27ac, and the absence of the h3k27me <dig> mark in our enhancer candidates indicates that the enhancers we identified are mainly of the active and intermediate, but not poised type. this conclusion is further supported by the finding that genes associated with enh in addition to prl showed the highest expression levels in mouse es cells. these findings also suggest that the tfs identified in motif analysis which are associated with differentiated cell types may have been the result of similarity in pssms between members of the same protein family such as sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig> 

despite the reported association of h3k27ac with active enhancers, introducing h3k27ac into our model showed positive weighting of h3k27ac for prl rather than enh, indicating that it is a predictor of promoters rather than enhancers. this is in agreement with higher enrichment overall of h3k27ac regions in prl compared to enh; whereas, the previously reported h3k27ac regions  <cit>  contain only the h3k27ac regions distal to genes and are therefore more enriched in the enh category. this dichotomy of h3k27ac marks is similar to rnapii-ser <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> which have been observed at distal enhancer regions   <cit> ; however, these features are more enriched around gene tsss compared to enhancers. as our model detects the overall trend, features enriched in both prl and enh either become a discriminating feature of the signature in which they are most enriched or their weights are reduced to zero with lasso regularization. it is possible that some of this overlap in marks is due to chromatin looping events which bring distal enhancers into close proximity with gene promoters  <cit> . this close juxtaposition could then allow for cross linking events between proteins at the promoter and enhancer regions capturing the marks in both locations. in addition chromatin modifying proteins recruited to either the promoter or a distal enhancer could act at both locations in the genome when they are juxtaposed in a chromatin loop.

we have shown that enh candidates are significantly further from gene tsss than prl candidates, and the absolute expression distribution of genes associated with enh and prl candidates is significantly higher than that of genes associated with prl alone, indicating additional activation of gene expression by enh candidates. these results are consistent with the enhancer/promoter dna looping model which promotes cell-type specific gene activation  <cit> . furthermore, we have also found that putative enhancer regions identified in our work are significantly enriched with mtl and that higher probability enh are associated with an increased number of bound tfs. this finding reveals the utility of our model in identifying high confidence regions bound by multiple tfs which are more likely associated with gene regulation  <cit> . moreover, as only 41% of the top candidates are co-bound by oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, enhancers identified from our approach are not limited to the training set of co-osn regions. to further identify novel enhancer-bound tfs that may play major roles in mouse es cells, we performed motif enrichment analysis on enhancer candidates. although motif enrichment analysis is limited by the pssm available, we have successfully identified motif enrichment of several known es cell-regulating tfs, including: klf <dig>  sox <dig>  oct <dig>  esrrb, stat <dig> and zic <dig>  in addition, we identified sp <dig>  previously reported to regulate oct <dig> and nanog gene expression through binding to their proximal promoters  <cit> . binding motifs for nrf <dig> and tead <dig> were also identified as enriched in the enh regions. both of these tfs are associated with regulatory roles during early development and are expressed in es cells  <cit> . interestingly, we have also identified enhancer regions closest to genes of almost all of these regulatory tfs. in agreement with this we found that genes associated with enh candidates are more exclusively enriched in go terms related to dna binding and transcriptional regulation, while the prl genes are associated with dna binding as well as more basal cellular functions. together these findings suggest that enhancers tend to locate around genes involved in transcriptional regulation in es cells, and work coordinately with prl candidates. the combination of regulation by a distal enhancer and proximal basal promoter perhaps allows gene expression to be fine tuned in a cell-type specific manner.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a widely applicable set of features to identify regulatory enhancers and promoter regions in a given cell type. use of these features yields enhancer regions associated with increased gene expression of neighbouring genes and es cell-specific histone modifications consistent with active enhancers.
