BACKGROUND
myxozoa is a group of endoparasites comprising over  <dig>  described species  <cit> . members of this group are pathogens of salmonid, sparids and other economically important aquacultural fish. in particular, myxozoan infections are responsible for whirling disease, proliferative kidney disease, ceratomyxosis, enteromyxosis and kudoasis  <cit> . there is no known effective treatment against myxozoan infections, and as a result they can cause severe economic losses in fish farms  <cit> . nevertheless, the vast majority of species produce benign infections that are typically asymptomatic.

the polar capsule is a highly complex intracellular structure found in myxozoan spores. polar capsules play a critical role in myxozoan infection, as the everted tubule of the polar capsule is what presumably anchors the myxozoan spore to its host  <cit> . despite the remarkable complexity and vital role polar capsules play in myxozoan parasitism, little is known about the structure and function of this organelle that characterizes this diverse group of microscopic parasites.

myxozoans were originally classified as protists, but current molecular  <cit>  and morphological  <cit>  evidence supports their phylogenetic placement as metazoans. their position among metazoans is debated , however recent data suggest that they are highly degenerate members of cnidaria   <cit> , and possibly the sister taxon to polypodium hydriforme, an enigmatic cnidarian parasite of the oocytes of sturgeon and paddlefish   <cit> .

the long appreciated observation that the myxozoan polar capsule bears remarkable similarity to the nematocyst, the stinging structure in cnidarians, gave rise to the hypothesis that myxozoans are in fact cnidarians  <cit> . both myxozoan polar capsules and cnidarian nematocysts consist of a capsule whose wall is continuous with a coiled tubule that everts from its apical end. the apical opening of the polar capsule is thought to be covered by a hinged cap , a structure characteristic of nematocysts from medusozoan cnidarians  and absent in anthozoans  <cit> . the morphological affinities between polar capsules and nematocysts have been supported by the finding that the myxozoan tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae possesses a nematocyst-specific gene called minicollagen  <cit> .

although little is known about the molecular basis of myxozoan polar capsules, extensive research has been conducted on the molecular composition of cnidarian nematocysts, especially in the model system hydra  <cit> . several genes expressed in the nematocyst are purportedly unique to the phylum cnidaria  <cit> . among the  <dig> nematocyst proteins of hydra  <cit> , four gene families have been well characterized; the minicollagen family , nematocyst outer wall antigen   <cit> , spinalin  <cit>  and the nematogalectin family  <cit> .

minicollagens are the primary structural components of nematocysts  <cit> . in hydra, different minicollagens are expressed in different parts of the nematocyst. for example, the minicollagen ncol- <dig> is localized to the tubule, while the minicollagen ncol- <dig> is localized in the capsule wall  <cit>  . interestingly, hydrozoans, which possess the largest diversity of nematocyst types, have been found to encode the largest number of minicollagen genes. it has thus been suggested that the expansion of this gene family, through gene duplication and sequence divergence, has been largely responsible for the complexity of this structure and diversity of nematocyst types found throughout the phylum  <cit> . a single minicollagen gene has been identified in the myxozoan tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae  <cit> .figure  <dig>

another gene characterized to be specific to nematocysts is nowa  which interlinks with the minicollagens to produce a scaffold strong enough to withstand the pressure of discharge  <cit> . the spinalin protein is present in the spines and operculum of hydra nematocysts  <cit> .

finally, nematogalectins are a family of genes among which some members have been found to interact with ncol- <dig> and a non-sulfated form of chondroitin to form the tubule wall  <cit> , . hwang et al.  <cit>  described three members of the nematogalectin family in cnidarians. the nematogalectin genes were called nematogalectin a, nematogalectin b and nematogalectin-related. hydrozoans were found to possess all three nematogalectins genes while anthozoans possessed only nematogalectin b and nematogalectin-related genes.

we searched for orthologs of these four cnidarian specific gene families in newly generated genome and/or transcriptome assemblies from three different myxozoan species as well as the putative sister taxon to myxozoa, polypodium hydriforme   <cit> . newly discovered genes were characterized in a phylogenetic context in order to investigate the origin and evolution of these cnidarian-restricted gene families.table  <dig>

RESULTS
mining myxozoan transcriptomes and genome assemblies for nematocyst genes
among the four cnidarian specific protein families considered , we were able to identify members of the minicollagen and nematogalectin gene families in three of the four myxozoan species . three different minicollagen sequences were identified in the transcriptome of kudoa iwatai. we then verified that these transcripts correspond to three different genes by searching the corresponding genes in the dna assembly. in addition, orthologous copies of these three genes were found in genomic assemblies for the other two myxozoan species investigated.

searching publicly available est data recovered two additional minicollagen sequences in buddenbrockia plumatellae, a myxozoan species which, together with t. bryosalmonae, belong to the class malacosporea  <cit> . a greater diversity of minicollagens was found in the transcriptome of the cnidarian parasite, polypodium hydriforme, with the identification of  <dig> unique minicollagen transcripts .

minicollagen sequences of hydra start with a signal peptide   <cit> . we verified that the presence of a signal peptide could be predicted for all myxozoan and polypodium minicollagen sequences. this also suggests that the 5′-end of the cds has been correctly identified.

our searches for nematogalectin orthologs led us to identify three genes which belong to this family in myxozoans, and four in polypodium . our reciprocal blast searches  lead us to discover that cnidarians contain additional members of this family that were not described by hwang et al.  <cit> . specifically, we found a novel clade of nematogalectin proteins here called nematogalectin-c, which was found to be present in anthozoans, medusozoans, p. hydriforme and myxozoans. unlike other nematogalectins, sequences within clade c are characterized by a long variable n-terminal end. this long n-terminal region could only be completely characterized for a few species with transcriptomic data of high quality . like other nematogalectins, all complete nematogalectin-c sequences  were found to begin with a signal peptide. the signal peptide region could not be identified in the predicted nematogalectin-c sequences of the sampled myxozoans, and the kudoa and enteromyxum sequences do not start with a methionine. this suggests that these sequences are incomplete. we also discovered additional anthozoan nematogalectin sequences. these sequences were found to be more similar to nematogalectin a and b sequences than to nematogalectin c or nematogalectin-related sequences . they were thus assumed to be the missing anthozoan nematogalectin a copies that were not identified by hwang et al.  <cit> . the sequences were thus named nematostella vectensis a, anemonia viridis a, metridium senile a, acropora digitifera a, acropora millepora a. all these new sequences were predicted to begin with a signal peptide.

our analyses thus indicate that cnidarians  possess four different nematogalectin genes while myxozoans have only three . we were unable to identify nematogalectin sequences in the est of b. plumatellae and t. bryosalmonae available in ncbi.

our blast searches did not identify any putative orthologs for the nowa and spinalin proteins in the myxozoan genomes or in the polypodium transcriptome.

minicollagen phylogenetic relationships and protein structure
since minicollagens are encoded by short and fast evolving sequences, most branches within the tree are not well-supported  , precluding reconstruction of the order of the duplication events. in addition, it is possible that the number of minicollagen genes is underestimated for species for which only est data are available .figure  <dig>

the myxozoan minicollagens were found to belong to three different clades, which are not well-supported . the minicollagens from polypodium cluster with myxozoan minicollagens in clades i and ii . the myxozoan minicollagen ii sequences  present an unusual structure with a c-terminal region which contains three repeats of the “poly-proline - crd” region . the two polypodium sequences related to this clade  possess two repeats of the “poly-proline - crd” region in their c-terminal region and one  or two  crd repeats in their n-terminal region .

comparison of the rna transcripts with the dna contigs in kudoa iwatai, indicate that minicollagen i possesses two introns while minicollagens ii and iii possess only a single intron . the same number of introns was also found for sphaeromyxa and enteromyxum with augustus  <cit>  intron/exon structure prediction.figure  <dig>

the trinity de novo assembler  <cit>  divides its predicted contigs into components, where contigs belonging to the same component are similar to different isoforms of the same gene. nevertheless, we could not find any evidence of alternative splicing in kudoa since each minicollagen gene matched to a single rna contig. in addition, each protein sequence in the polypodium assembly was represented by two contigs, which differ by only a few base pairs on the third codon position. since no evidence of alternative splicing was found among the polypodium contigs and since we extracted rna from several individuals , these different contigs most likely represent allelic variability.

nematogalectin phylogenetic relationships and protein structure
the phylogenetic tree of nematogalectins divides these genes into two clades, nematogalectin-related proteins and other nematogalectins . many relationships within the nematogalectin clade are poorly supported. however, the nematogalectin c clade is well-supported , which suggests a common origin of these sequences. within the nematogalectin c clade, myxozoa appear to diverge first which could be the result of a long-branch artefact since they possess the fastest evolving sequences  <cit> . other branchings within this clade follow classical taxonomic relationships.figure  <dig>

relationships among nematogalectin a and b are more obscure and the positions of the myxozoan and polypodium sequences cannot be confidently determined. surprisingly, nematogalectin a and b are not recovered as two distinct clades. instead, nematogalectin a and b of hydra, clytia and polypodium cluster with each other , suggesting that these are paralogs in each of these individual lineages  . in contrast, all of the representative anthozoan nematogalactin b genes form a well-supported clade . the, anthozoan nematogalectin a genes do not form a monophyletic clade, but this could be due to their fast evolving sequences and the sequence of nematostella in particular, which appears to be extremely divergent .

among nematogalectin-related genes, the myxozoan sequences  possess a similar intron/exon structure as in other cnidarians  <cit>  with a first intron after the end of the signal peptide and a second intron between the collagen and the gal-lectin domains . these two introns are also present in nematogalectin a and nematogalectin c . the nematogalectins a of kudoa and sphaeromyxa possess an additional intron located at the end of the gal-lectin domain, while the nematogalectins c also possess at least five additional introns in their long 5′-region . no evidence of alternative splicing was found in the cds of the nematogalectin a, b and the nematogalectin-related genes of kudoa or polypodium. however, although it is possible that alternative splicing occurs in the long 5′-region of nematogalectin c of kudoa, as two different transcripts were found, this could not be confirmed.figure  <dig>

discussion
our results indicate that myxozoans possess two cnidarian restricted gene families - minicollagen and nematogalectin - which play a critical role in the nematocyst structure. like cnidarian proteins, the myxozoan proteins possess signal peptides indicating that they are excreted by post-golgi vacuoles, in which nematocysts and polar capsules are formed  <cit> . the absence of nowa and spinalin is not totally unexpected since these two proteins seem to be restricted to hydra as no orthologs were found in the genomes of any other cnidarians  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that unrelated or very divergent proteins might replace nowa and spinalin in myxozoa and polypodium.

our results show that myxozans possess three different minicollagen genes , displaying a higher diversity of minicollagens than previously appreciated. minicollagens have been divided into three groups based on their cysteine-rich domain  organization. specifically, both the n-terminal and c-terminal crd domains follow the pattern cxxxcxxxcxxxcxxxcc in group  <dig> minicollagens. group  <dig> is characterized by n-terminal crds similar to that of group  <dig> minicollagens but with variable and different c-terminal crd patterns  <cit> . finally, group  <dig> is characterized by variable crd patterns both at the n-terminal and c-terminal. low node support in our phylogenetic analysis precludes us from determining whether this classification reflects orthologous relationships  <cit>  . following this classification most myxozoans and polypodium genes belong to group  <dig> minicollagens. however, several exceptions exist. first, tetracapsuloides ncol- <dig>  which has been considered to be homologous to group  <dig> minicollagen, would belong to group  <dig> . additionally, the second and third crds of myxozoan ncol- <dig> sequences, and the second crd of polypodium ncol- <dig>   are found to possess non canonical crd domains and thus should be classified as group  <dig> minicollagens . among the additional polypodium sequences, polypodium ncol- <dig> possesses a missing non-cysteine residue in its c-terminal crd and should thus be classified as group  <dig> minicollagen. finally, polypodium ncol- <dig> , <dig> would belong to group  <dig> minicollagen, polypodium ncol- <dig> is the most derived sequence with non-canonical crds at both ends, while polypodium ncol- <dig>  possess a standard crd domain followed by additional non-canonical crds in their n-terminal regions . these observations confirm that minicollagen structures can be quite variable, among related sequences.

the crds of the n- and c- terminal ends of hydra minicollagen ncol- <dig>  have been shown to fold into different structures which involve completely different pairs of disulfide bridges among the six cysteine residues  <cit> . two non-cysteine residues have been shown to be involved in this conformational change. precisely, the presence of a valine or isoleucine before the second cysteine and the presence of a proline after the fourth cysteine of the crd lead to a c-terminal structure in more than 95% of the cases  <cit> . interestingly, the presence of only one of these residues has been found to lead to a “bridge state” which can adopt both structures  <cit> .

surprisingly, myxozoan and polypodium minicollagen canonical crds were found to differ from these n- and c- terminal patterns. specifically, the n-terminal crds of myxozoa ncol- <dig> and polypodium ncol- <dig> were found to possess a proline residue after their fourth cysteine , which would give them the possibility to have a conformation characteristic of a c-terminal end. it is worth noting that these are the only minicollagen sequences which possess such proline mutations in our alignment among canonical n-terminal crds. similarly, the c-terminal crds of myxozoa ncol- <dig> and polypodium ncol-1- <dig> do not possess a proline but rather a histidine after their fourth cysteine , which would suggest that these proteins adopt an n-terminal configuration at both ends. we stress again that these are the only canonical c-terminal crds which possess this peculiarity in our alignment. these observations indicate that myxozoan and polypodium minicollagens have novel organizations and might thus form different structures than other cnidarian minicollagens.

the facts that these characteristic structures are shared by polypodium and myxozoa, and that polypodium and myxozoan minicollagens often belong to the same clades, support the notion that myxozoan minicollagens originated from ancient duplications – prior to the myxozoa/polypodium divergence - and are not the result of recent specializations of the polar capsule.

the diversity of minicollagens has been linked to nematocyst diversity, under the hypothesis that different minicollagens might be expressed in different types of nematocyst  <cit> . the life cycle of myxozoans from the class myxosporea possess two types of spores. myxospores develop in the vertebrate host  and actinospores develop in an invertebrate . each type of spore contains polar capsules  <cit> . all three minicollagen genes found in the myxozoan genomes were expressed in the myxospore life cycle stage of the kudoa transcriptome, suggesting that actinospores and myxospores do not possess different minicollagens. this observation agrees with the fact that the polar capsule structure is identical in actinospores and myxospores  <cit> . the loss of minicollagen diversity in myxozoa is also in agreement with the hypothesis that the diversity of minicollagen is linked to the nematocyst diversity. by comparison, polypodium, which holds  <dig> canonical minicollagens, possesses both atrichous isorhizas and four types of holotrichous isorhizas  <cit> . similarly hydra possess  <dig> different types of minicollagens  <cit>  and four different types of nematocysts: desmonemes, atrichous isorhizas, holotrichous isorhizas; and stenoteles  <cit> . this indicates that the myxozoan minicollagen repertoire was dramatically simplified with their parasitic life style.

similarly, the myxozoan nematogalectin repertoire is also simplified. while cnidarians possess both nematogalectin a and nematogalectin b, myxozoans possess only nematogalectin a. it has been previously shown that nematogalectin genes a and b, are expressed in different parts of the nematocyst tubule in hydra  <cit> . specifically, nematogalectin b has been found to be expressed in the proximal tubule, which is also characterized by the presence of numerous barbs or spine ridges, while nematogalectin a is expressed in the distal tubule which is thinner and smoother  <cit> . nematocysts whose tubules are entirely spiny  only express nematogalectin b  <cit> . this suggests that the polar filament might have a simpler structure than the nematocyst tubule. interestingly, it is worth noting that the myxozoan polar filament does not possess spines  <cit> , supporting the idea that myxozoans lost the nematogalectin b gene while retaining the nematogalectin a gene.

our phylogenetic results also show that the nematogalectin a and b sequences cluster as sister groups in hydra, polypodium and clytia , suggesting gene duplications in each of these lineages. however, given their critical role in nematocyst structure  and the unparsimonious scenario that each lineage underwent a duplication independently, we suggest that instead, nematogalectin copies are evolving under some level of concerted evolution in medusozoans. this is supported by the observation that in hydra, both nematogalectin copies belong to the same transcript  <cit> . such close positioning is known to facilitate concerted evolution in duplicated genes  <cit> . conversely, the anthozoan nematogalectin a and b form two distinct clades and it is worth noting that these two genes are located on different contigs in the nematostella assembly  <cit> .

although no evidence of concerted evolution was found among other nematogalectin genes, we observed that all three genes are present on the same contig in sphaeromyxa. on this contig, the nematogalectin-related gene has a direct orientation and is followed by the nematogallectin a gene which has the same orientation. the nematogalectin c is next but with a reverse orientation. although our phylogenetic analysis did not recover close relationships amongst these genes in sphaeromyxa, it is possible that some level of concerted evolution might also occur between the nematogalectin related and the nematogalectin a gene in sphaeromyxa.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that the myxozoan polar capsule is homologous to the cnidarian nematocyst. we here describe nematocyst-specific orthologs from two protein families. however, it is likely that the homology extends to a larger number of proteins.

the origin of the polar capsule, however, is still unclear. the phylogenetic analysis of minicollagen sequences suggests a possible relationship between polypodium and myxozoans and thus a medusozoan origin  <cit> . however, this sister clade relationship was not found with the nematogalectin sequences, where myxozoa appear to be an early diverging taxa in all nematogalectin clades. because myxozoan sequences are fast evolving, it cannot be excluded that this basal positioning is the result of a long-branch artefact. additional information from the polar capsule genes of divergent medusozoan families and from malacosporean myxozoans should provide further insights into the evolution of the polar capsule.
