BACKGROUND
epigenetic changes are reversible and interfere with many key biological functions, including regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling, dna methylation/demethylation and microrna. moreover, many of these changes have been linked to the pathogenesis of human diseases and cancers  <cit> .

aberrant dna methylation is frequent in myeloid malignancies, particularly in the myelodysplastic syndrome  and acute myelogenous leukemia . promoter cpg methylation correlates with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in specific pathways, which are also the targets for mutations or other mechanisms of inactivation  <cit> . epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis appear more complex and deregulations occur at multiple disease stages. accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms, involving for instance dna methyltransferase  and histone deacetylase  inhibitors, have had some clinical success when applied to mds and aml  <cit> .

dna methylation and histone tail modifications are characteristic epigenetic signatures in physiologic development that become abnormal in neoplasia. thus, silencing of critical genes by dna methylation or histone deacetylation can contribute to leukemogenesis as an alternative to deletion or loss-of-function mutations. in aml, aberrant dna methylation has been observed in several of functionally relevant genes, such as p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  e-cadherin, id <dig> and rarβ <dig>  it was shown for instance by hopfer and coauthors  <cit>  that associations between aberrant promoter methylation and dnmt expression predict high-risk mds for all lineages and during erythropoiesis. moreover, hypermethylation of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  survivin, chk <dig>  rarβ and dapk genes were associated with elevated dnmt isoform expression.

abnormal activities of histone tail-modifying enzymes have also been seen in aml, frequently as a direct result of chromosomal translocations. it is now clear that these epigenetic changes play a significant role in development and progression of aml, and thus constitute important targets of therapy  <cit> . interactions between histone modifications and dna methylation are less well studied. although genome-wide studies have suggested that there is a negative correlation between h3k4me <dig> and dna methylation, and a positive one between h3k9me <dig> and dna methylation, insights into the understanding of these connections have just recently advanced  <cit> .

hematopoietic stem cells characteristically display self-renewal and differentiation into mature distinct hematopoietic lineages; defining the latter and understanding of the processes that control their differentiation and self-renewal or cause their malignancies are thus of great interest. human hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells collected from healthy human blood, kg <dig> cells representing blocked differentiation at an early stage of hematopoietic development, and mature human neutrophils can accordingly be used in epigenomic surveys. cd34+ cells provide a valuable model system where progression from quiescent to cycling to differentiated states can be linked to changes in chromatin rearrangements. changes in histones h <dig> and h <dig> modifications being associated with chromatin activation, i.e. h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k9ac/s10ph and h <dig> hyperac, and reactivation of methylation-silenced genes could be distinct in hematopoietic primary cd34+ cells, kg <dig> cells and mature neutrophils. we employed computational analyses of confocal images to evaluate such histone modifications changes in these cell populations.

we disclosed that the rates of methylation in promoter regions of genes involved in the control of differentiation  and cell cycle progression  were considerably lower than that of unmethylation in cd34+, neutrophils and kg <dig> cells. as evaluated by computer-assisted methods the h <dig> and h <dig> modifications h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k9ac/s10ph and h <dig> hyperac were similar for cd34+ cells and human mature neutrophils. the kg <dig> cells displayed elevated levels of those modifications with an increase after treatment with hdac inhibitors . to conclude, our findings could be important for identification and evaluation of new biomarkers and targets for leukemia differentiation therapy.

RESULTS
methylation of p <dig>  p <dig>  e-cadherin, and rarβ genes in hematopoietic cells during granulocytic differentiation
here we chose to examine the methylation status in specific promoter regions of genes involved in cell cycle regulation  and granulocytic differentiation  during hematopoietic cell development. as distinct cellular models we employed human hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells collected from healthy human blood, the human myeloid leukemia cell line kg <dig>  whose development is stopped at early stage of differentiation, and mature human neutrophils.

as presented in figure  <dig>  the hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells and mature neutrophils  presented similar demethylation levels of both cell cycle- and differentiation- regulating genes. however, there were lower p <dig>  e-cadherin, rar beta and higher p <dig> methylations in human neutrophils than in hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells. the promoters of all genes investigated were methylated in kg <dig> cells. incidentally, it is known that the ink <dig> family of proteins p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> function as cell cycle inhibitors by being involved in the inhibition of g <dig> phase progression. methylation of the p <dig> promoter is a major gene silencing mechanism in hematological malignancies, while p <dig> and p <dig> promoter methylations often occur in solid tumors, as well as in leukemia and lymphoma  <cit> . mizuno and coworkers  <cit>  demonstrated that dnmt genes were constitutively expressed, although at different levels, in t lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and normal bone marrow cells. altered expression of dnmt in hematopoietic cells could cause an aberrant methylation/demethylation status of genes in these cells. using methylation-specific pcr, it was observed that the p <dig> gene was methylated in  <dig> of  <dig>  cases of patients with aml. recently we have also shown, that the dnmt inhibitor  zebularine alone or in sequential combination with retinoic acid  decreased expression of dnmt <dig> in kg <dig> and nb <dig> cells, caused partial demethylation of e-cadherin and reexpression of pan-cadherin but not the tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit> . we have also demonstrated  <cit>  that dnmti rg <dig> changed e-cadherin promoter methylation status and the levels of the transcript and protein in nb <dig> cells. when promyelocytic leukemia cells were treated with rg <dig> and sodium-4-phenylbutyrate  as single agents and in combination with ra we found  <cit>  that these treatments cause increased levels of histone h <dig> acetylation and methylation of histone h3k4me <dig>  both modifications represent an active chromatin state that leads to opening of chromatin structure and induces granulocytic differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells.

here, we observed that specific promoter regions of genes involved in granulocytic differentiation  are highly unmethylated both in hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells and mature neutrophils . it is known that e-cadherin is functionally involved in the differentiation process of cells along the erythroid lineage  <cit> , in cd34+ stem cells and in bone marrow stroma cell  <cit> , and plays a crucial role in cell-cell aggregation during development and could promote intercellular interactions during hematopoiesis. in neutrophils certain promoter regions of e-cadherin are highly unmethylated , which relates to differentiation stage of hematopoietic cells.

corn and others  <cit>  have shown that e-cadherin was aberrantly methylated in  <dig> of  <dig>  leukemia cell lines, in  <dig> of  <dig>  acute myelogeneous leukemias, and in  <dig> of  <dig>  acute lymphoblastic leukemias. methylation was associated with loss of specific e-cadherin rna and protein in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemias. following treatment with different dnmtis like 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine  <cit>  or zebularine  <cit> , leukemia cell line expressed both the e-cadherin transcript and protein.

rarβ is an ra-regulated tumor suppressor gene silenced by aberrant dna methylation in acute promyelocytic leukemia  and other human malignancies  <cit> . in human leukemia hl- <dig> and k <dig> cell lines rarβ gene is silenced  <cit> . moreover, using the hdacis and dnmtis  has been shown to restore the expression of silenced rarβ <cit> . in our study we observed that the rarβ methylation/unmethylation ratio in kg <dig> cells was balanced and constitutes around 50%, whereas in human hematopoietic progenitor cells cd34+ and mature neutrophils rarβ promoter regions were methylated only to about 25%.

our results demonstrate that demethylations in specific promoter regions of p <dig>  p <dig>  e-cadherin and rarβ are common phenomena in normal hematopoietic cells and corroborate a hypothesis that methylation of these genes occurs in leukemogenesis.

distribution of histones, histone variants and modifications during hematopoietic cell granulocytic differentiation toward mature neutrophils
core histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> wrap dna and affect chromatin condensation levels through both histone and dna modifications. the chromatin structure plays an essential role in gene regulation during cell development, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and core histones as well as linker histone h <dig> variants could be important factors for the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency, dna condensation and gene expression regulation  <cit> . indeed, some of histone variants, i.e. h <dig> , h2a.z, h2a.x and macro h2a play precise roles in chromatin structure regulation  <cit> .

in our study we examined core histone and linker histone h <dig> distributions in hematopoietic cd34+ stem cells, control and induced to granulocytic differentiation myeloid leukemia kg <dig> cells and mature human neutrophils. isolated histones were fractionated in an aut system and stained  or after fractionation sub-fractionated with sds/page . in figure  <dig> we show that linker histone h <dig> expression decreased during differentiation and is in a low level in mature human neutrophils. terme and co-workers  <cit>  have demonstrated that h <dig> variants are differentially expressed during cell differentiation; here pluripotent cells  have lower levels of the histone variant h <dig>  and higher levels of the h <dig>  and h <dig>  variants, whereas others, i.e. h <dig>  and h <dig> , did not display any significant changes.

histone h <dig> is an important epigenetic target because of its diverse modification states. in our study we showed that h <dig>  and h <dig>  are slightly decreased in cd34+ and nf in comparison to kg <dig> cells represented differentiating hematopoietic cells . the histone h <dig> variant h <dig>  level did decline only in mature human neutrophils , where an active gene expression was reduced. it has been shown that h <dig>  containing nucleosomes are enriched in active chromatin  <cit> . jin and felsenfeld  <cit>  have demonstrated that h <dig>  may play a direct role in activation of the chicken folate receptor  and β-globin genes. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> histones h2a and h2b did not exibit apparent differences in all types of examined cells. by contrast the acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> was striking in kg <dig> cells induced to granulocytic differentiation by hdaci pb and ra  <cit> , but not with dnmti rg <dig> .

our findings suggest that core histones and their variants as well as the linker histone h <dig> distribute diversely during granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells and that their distribution reflects the differentiation status of hematopoietic cells.

h <dig> and h <dig> modifications highlight active chromatin as being important in hematopoietic differentiation
for evaluation of histone modifications and active chromatin formation during granulocytic differentiation we investigated the modification status of h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k9ac/s10ph and h <dig> hyperac histones in human hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells, untreated and treated with pb as a hdaci or rg <dig> as a non-nucleoside dnmti human myeloid leukemia kg <dig> cells, and mature human neutrophils.

in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> we present confocal images of the fluorescence intensity of histones h3k4me <dig> , h3k9ac , h3k9ac/s10ph  and h <dig> hyperac  together with ratios of the median values of the fluorescent intensities. total fluorescence intensity for each cell type grouped by class  was used for the computation of median values. the hematopoietic progenitor cd34+ cells and neutrophils showed very similar histone modification levels , except for h3k4me3; the latter is present in transcriptionally active chromatin and in neutrophils its level was reduced . moreover, it was diminished in control kg <dig> cells  in comparison with cd34+ cells. h3k9me <dig> deregulation in aml is related preferentially to a decrease of the modifications in core promoter regions. muller-tidow and coworkers  <cit>  have shown that a decrease in h3k4me <dig> levels at cres was associated with increased cre-driven promoter activity in vivo in aml blasts. there are also widespread changes of h3k9me <dig> levels at gene promoters in aml  <cit> . paul and coworkers  <cit>  observed that reactivation of p15ink4b expression in aml cell lines and patient blasts using 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine  and trichostatin a  increased h3k4me <dig> and maintained h3k27me <dig> enrichment at p15ink4b. these data indicate that aml cells with p15ink4b dna methylation have an altered histone methylation pattern compared to unmethylated samples and that these changes are reversible by epigenetic drugs.

we have demonstrated previously  <cit>  that the dnmti zebularine induced regional chromatin remodeling by local histone h <dig> hyperacetylation and histone h3k <dig> methylation in promoter sites of methylated e-cadherin and unmethylated p <dig> in promyelocytic leukemia nb <dig> cells. in this study we also saw increased h <dig> and h <dig> acetylated forms both in control and in treated with hdaci and dnmti kg <dig> cells. moreover, pb as a hdaci and rg <dig> as a dnmti did not induce kg <dig> cell differentiation albeit they changed the range of histones h <dig> and h <dig> modifications. the elucidation of the epigenetic changes in normal hematopoietic cells and myeloid leukemia cells induced to differentiate will contribute towards the clarification of the histone modifications dynamics in myeloid cell lineage development.

these histone modifications are capable of affecting chromatin structure and gene transcription regulation. consequently, epigenetic modifiers can be governed in order to regulate repressed genes in leukemia cells. the evaluation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> modifications  could be instrumental for finding new leukemia biomarkers on an epigenome basis.

CONCLUSIONS
evaluation of the methylation status of specific promoter regions of p <dig>  p <dig>  e-cadherin and rarβ genes, core and linker histones distribution, histones h <dig> and h <dig> modifications  during hematopoietic cell differentiation can provide a new basis for identifying chromatin epigenetic modulators as targets in the regulation of hematopoiesis and for leukemia induced differentiation therapy.
