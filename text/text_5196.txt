BACKGROUND
salvia is characterized with only two stamens connected to form a lever. it includes about  <dig> species and is the largest genus of the labiatae family. salvia, together with the genera lepechinia, melissa, dorystaechas, meriandra, zhumeria, perovskia and rosmarinus, forms a monophylectic lineage within the labiatae  <cit> . s. miltiorrhiza bunge, known as danshen in chinese, is an economically important medicinal plant species of the salvia genus. it shows close phylogenetic relationships with other asian and mediterranean species in the salvia genus, such as s. roborowskii and s. glutinosa <cit> . s. miltiorrhiza has been widely and successfully used in traditional chinese medicine  for hundred of years to treat numerous diseases, such as coronary heart diseases, dysmenorrheal, amenorrhoea, and inflammatory diseases  <cit> . the main bioactive components of s. miltiorrhiza may be divided into two groups. the first group is abietane type-diterpene quinine pigments, known as tanshinones, which are lipophilic and consist of more than thirty compounds  <cit> . the second group is hydrophilic phenolic acids, including rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid a, salvianolic acid b, lithospermic acid, and many other chemicals  <cit> . biosynthesis of main bioactive components in s. miltiorrhiza requires the coordination of a series of key enzymes  <cit> . the expression of genes encoding these key enzymes is regulated by various transcription factors, of which mybs appear to play significant roles  <cit> . identification and characterization of myb genes in s. miltiorrhiza is very important in understanding the regulatory mechanism of bioactive component biosynthesis. since mybs are also vital regulators in plant development and plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses, elucidation of myb-associated regulatory networks may greatly help in improving the growth and defense abilities of s. miltiorrhiza through genetic engineering approaches.

myb proteins, characterized by the myb domain, have been widely found in many organisms, including animals, fungi and plants. the myb domain of myb proteins is deeply conserved and contains up to four imperfect repeats  of about  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . many vertebrates contain three myb genes, known as c-myb, a-myb and b-myb <cit> . the repeats in c-myb proteins are referred to as r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  repeats from other proteins are named based on their similarity to r <dig>  r <dig> or r <dig> of c-myb proteins  <cit> . in plants, myb is the largest transcription factor family and may be classified into four subfamilies based on the number of adjacent imperfect repeats  <cit> . it includes r1r2r3r1/2-mybs , r1r2r3-mybs , r2r3-mybs and mybs with a single or partial myb repeat , of which r2r3-myb is the largest subfamily of plant mybs  <cit> . the number of r2r3-myb genes in arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa and oryza sativa is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

r2r3-myb proteins contain two repeats similar to r <dig> and r <dig> of c-myb proteins and have been proposed to be evolved from a 3r-myb gene ancestor by the loss of r <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the myb domain, other less conserved motifs were also found in r2r3-myb proteins. based on the similarity of these motifs or phylogenetic relationships of myb amino acids, r2r3-mybs may be divided into subgroups. for instance, the large arabidopsis r2r3-myb subfamily has been divided into  <dig> subgroups according to the motifs  <cit> . however, based on phylogenetic relationships, the number of r2r3-myb subgroups in arabidopsis, p. trichocarpa, soybean and maize is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . it suggests that the resulting number of r2r3-myb subgroups in arabidopsis significantly varies between two approaches used and shows that some subgroups are not deeply conserved among different plant species. proteins in non-conserved subgroups might have specialized roles.

the functions of numerous r2r3-mybs have been characterized in arabidopsis. the known functions were well-summarized into four plant-specific processes, including primary and secondary metabolism, cell fate and identity, developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . it clearly demonstrates functional divergence and significance of arabidopsis r2r3-mybs. extensive studies on the myb gene family have been conducted in various plant species, such as rice, maize, wheat, poplar, eucalyptus and gentian  <cit> . the results showed that the functions of r2r3-mybs belonging to the same subgroup were usually conserved among different plant species. for instance, subgroup  <dig> mybs, including arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  <cit> , grape vvmybf <dig>  <cit> , tomato slmyb <dig>  <cit> , gentian gtmybp <dig> and gtmybp <dig>  <cit> , and many others, are involved in the control of flavonol biosynthesis. subgroup  <dig> mybs, such as arabidopsis atmyb75/pap <dig>  atmyb90/pap <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  <cit> , cauliflower bomyb <dig>  <cit> , apple myb110a  <cit> , and pear pymyb <dig>  <cit> , regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. it suggests that the functions of mybs may be predicted by phylogenetic analysis. so far, little is known about mybs in s. miltiorrhiza.

s. miltiorrhiza is emerging as a model plant for tcm studies, since its relatively small genome size , short life cycle, undemanding growth requirements, and significant medicinal value  <cit> . recently, the genome of s. miltiorrhiza has been sequenced and a working draft of the genome has been assembled . in order to elucidate the role of myb genes in s. miltiorrhiza development, defense and bioactive component biosynthesis, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the r2r3-myb gene subfamily in s. miltiorrhiza.

RESULTS
identification of 110 s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-myb genes
through blast analysis of  <dig> a. thaliana r2r3-mybs  <cit>  against the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome  and subsequent gene prediction of the retrieved genomic dna sequences, a total of  <dig> full-length or near full-length members of the s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-myb gene subfamily were predicted. notably, it may not be a complete set of r2r3-myb genes in s. miltiorrhiza, since the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome is just a working draft and we do identified from the current assembly some partial sequences with high homology to known r2r3-mybs in other plant species . to verify the results from computational prediction,primers were designed for pcr-amplification of full-length coding sequences  of 110 s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-mybs. a total of  <dig> cdss were obtained. sequence comparison showed that the cloned cdss of  <dig> r2r3-mybs were identical to the predicted sequences. the other seven cloned cdss, including those of smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig>  differed from the predicted ones by one or a few bases only; however, the deduced amino acids were identical. the results confirm the correctness of myb gene annotation and suggest the reliability of dna sequence data. we were not able to clone the cds of smmyb <dig>  it could be due to low expression level in the tissues analyzed. all  <dig> cloned cdss and the predicted smmyb <dig> have been submitted to genbank. the accession numbers in genbank are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of r2r3-myb proteins from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis
in order to know the relationship of r2r3-mybs in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis, a neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega <dig>  . the results showed that many s. miltiorrhiza mybs were highly similar to their counterparts in arabidopsis. based on the phylogenetic tree and previous results from arabidopsis <cit> , r2r3-mybs in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis might be classified into  <dig> subgroups , of which s1–s <dig> were named as previously described  <cit> ; while the others were novel. thirty one of  <dig> subgroups included proteins from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis, whereas the other six were specific to s. miltiorrhiza  or arabidopsis . species-specific subgroups of r2r3-mybs have also been found in other plant species, such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . since mybs in a subgroup usually play similar roles or function in a metabolic pathway  <cit> , our results indicate that some mybs play deeply conserved roles in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis, while the others may exhibit species-specialized functions.

conservation and divergence of myb domain
the myb domain of myb proteins is highly conserved in plants. it contains up to four imperfect repeats  of about  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . r2r3-mybs are characterized with two repeats, known as r <dig> and r <dig>  consistently, the myb domain of s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs contain  <dig> residues, of which  <dig> form r <dig>  while the other  <dig> constitute r <dig> . in order to elucidate sequence features of myb domain and the degree of conservation of each residue, multiple sequence alignment was performed and sequence logos were created for r <dig> and r <dig> of r2r3-mybs from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis . the results showed that the distribution of residues in r <dig> and r <dig> of s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-mybs was quite similar to arabidopsis . r <dig> of both s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs contains three highly conserved tryptophan residues  at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , which may form a tryptophan cluster in the 3-dimensional hth structure and play significant roles in myb-dna interaction  <cit> . similarly, three regularly spaced and highly conserved residues, including a phenylalanine  and two tryptophan residues, exist at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of r <dig> . the highly conserved tryptophan residues were also found in r2r3-mybs from other plant species, such as populus trichocarpa <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . although the phenylalanine at position  <dig> of r <dig> is conserved in r2r3-mybs from s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis, and other plant species, such as p. trichocarpa <cit>  and soybean  <cit> , the degree of conservation is apparently less compared with the tryptophan residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . the functional significance of phenylalanine at position  <dig> of r <dig> remains to be elucidated. the other conserved residues in r <dig> and r <dig> were mainly distributed between the second and the third residues of three conserved residues described above . the residues between the first and the second conserved tryptophan in r <dig> and those between the conserved phenylalanine and the first conserved tryptophan in r <dig>  particularly the residues forming the first helix in each repeat, are apparently less conserved . the 3’ region of r <dig> in both s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs contains a highly conserved lrpd motif , which was also observed in p. trichocarpa <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . the results suggest the conservation of amino acid distribution in the myb domain of plant r2r3-mybs. on the other hand, the patterns at positions  <dig>  22– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of r <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of r <dig> are different between s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis , showing divergence of the myb domain.

analysis of conserved motifs other than the myb domain
it has been shown that the c-terminal region next to the myb domain of r2r3-mybs usually contains functionally important motifs, although these motifs are less conserved compared with the myb domain  <cit> . using the meme suite, a total of  <dig> motifs were identified in the downstream of myb domain of s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs . the length of motifs varies from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and the number of motifs in each myb varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  no motifs were predicted for  <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs. although the majority of  <dig> motifs exist in both s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs, five  are atmyb-specific . no smmyb-specific motifs were identified. among  <dig> motifs, motif  <dig> is the most common motif, which was found in  <dig> atmybs and  <dig> smmybs. the next common motifs are motifs  <dig> and  <dig> present in  <dig> atmybs/ <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs/ <dig> smmybs, respectively. many s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-mybs in a subgroup share at least a motif. consistently, many arabidoopsis r2r3-mybs in a subgroup contain same motif as their s. miltiorrhiza orthologues in the subgroup   <cit> . it suggests the conservation of motifs in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis r2r3-mybs belonging to a subgroup. the majority of motifs were found in more than one subgroup of r2r3-mybs, except motifs  <dig> and  <dig> existing in s <dig> and motif  <dig> in s <dig>  for instance, motifs  <dig> and  <dig> widely exist in r2r3-mybs belonging to  <dig> and  <dig> subgroups, respectively . taken together, the results suggest that these motifs are evolutionarily conserved and functionally important; however, it is currently unknown for the underlying mechanism of motifs to be under selection and conserved among divergent species.

expression profiling of s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-myb genes
in order to elucidate possible roles of r2r3-mybs in the growth and development of s. miltiorrhiza, we investigated the relative expression level of  <dig> smmybs in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of two-year-old, field nursery-grown s. miltiorrhiza plants using the quantitative real-time rt-pcr method. transcripts were detected for  <dig> of  <dig> smmybs . the expression of smmyb <dig> was undetected, which is consistent with the result from cds cloning. it indicates that smmyb <dig> may be pseudogenes or expressed at specific developmental stages or under special conditions. of the  <dig> detectable smmybs,  <dig>  showed predominant expression in leaves,  <dig>  in flowers,  <dig>  in stems, and  <dig>  in roots. the other  <dig>  were highly expressed in at least two tissues analyzed . differential expression of smmybs is consistent with the fact that each myb is usually involved in a limited number of cellular processes.

further examination of the expression of smmybs in each subgroup showed that some myb genes in a subgroup shared similar expression profiles and the profiles were consistent with known functions of their arabidopsis counterparts. for instance, s <dig> contains  <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs , of which atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are gibberellin-regulated mybs  involved in gibberellin signaling  <cit> . it has been shown that atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> redundantly facilitate anther development. in the anther of a myb <dig> myb <dig> double mutant, the tapetum underwent hypertrophy at the pollen mother cell stage  <cit> . analyzing the expression of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> showed complete repression in vegetative tissues through a mir159-associated regulatory mechanism  <cit> . consistently, smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig>  four s. miltiorrhiza mybs include in s <dig>  were predominantly expressed in flowers , suggesting their significant roles in flower development. in addition, smmyb <dig> belonging to s <dig> was predominately expressed in s. miltiorrhiza stems with plenty of lignin . it is consistent with the function of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> belonging to the same subgroup of smmyb <dig> in activation of pal, c4h and 4cl genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and various other genes related to lignin biosynthesis  <cit> .

on the other hand, many smmyb genes in a subgroup showed differential expression in s. miltiorrhiza. even so, the expression profiles were still consistent with known functions of their arabidopsis counterparts. s <dig> includes  <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs, of which smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> were root-specific. smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> was exclusively found in roots and exhibited low level in flowers. atmyb <dig> was predominantly expressed in roots and was also found in flowers and shoots. smmyb <dig> was highly expressed in stems and less in leaves. smmyb <dig> was highly expressed in leaves and less in stems. smmyb <dig> was abundant in roots and less in stems and leaves, while smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> were expressed in all tissues analyzed   <cit> . consistently, atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> redundantly regulate axillary meristem formation at different stages of vegetative development  <cit> , whereas atmyb <dig> is a root growth-specific regulator  <cit> . atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> belonging to s <dig> are mixta-like transcription factors involved in trichome differentiation, petal cell development and petal morphogenesis  <cit> . consistently, all s <dig> smmybs, including smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig>  were highly expressed in leaves with abundant of trichomes . in addition, smmyb <dig>  smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig> were also highly expressed in flowers . taken together, the results strongly suggest that many smmybs play similar roles as atmybs in the same subgroup.

mirna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of smmybs
plant micrornas  are a class of endogenous noncoding rnas with size about  <dig> nucleotides. they play vital roles in plant development and stress responses mainly through direct cleavage of target mrnas with perfect or near-perfect complementarities  <cit> . it allows an effective prediction of target sequence through computational approaches  <cit> . so far, a total of  <dig> arabidopsis mirna gene families, representing  <dig> mature mirnas, have been identified  <cit> . among them, eight  produced from three gene families, including mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were found to regulate the expression of various atmyb genes  <cit> . the regulatory role of mirnas in mybs also exists in apple  <cit> . in order to elucidate mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of s. miltiorrhiza mybs, we searched all smmybs for potential targets of deeply conserved mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> smmybs with complementary sequence to the member of mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families were identified . of  <dig> smmybs,  <dig> were predicted targets of mir <dig>   <dig> were of mir <dig>   <dig> were of mir <dig>  while the other  <dig> were common targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  or mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  it suggests the identification of total  <dig> mirna target sites, of which  <dig>  locate in r <dig>   <dig> in r <dig>  and  <dig>  in other regions . the large proportion of putative mirna target sites in r <dig> could be due to the deep conservation of sequence in this region. although all target sites of mir <dig> and mir <dig> locate in r <dig>  mir <dig> target to more conserved 5’ end, while mir <dig> targets to less conserved 3’ end. it results in that the number of mir <dig> targets,  <dig>  is much greater than that of mir <dig>   <dig>  one of four target sites of mir <dig> locates in r <dig>  the other three target sites of mir <dig> and two target sites of mir <dig>  including the overlapping target sites of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig>  locate in less conserved regions other than r <dig> and r <dig> . it suggests the conservation and divergence of mirna target sites and indicates that the number of mirna targets in a gene family is associated with the location of target sites.

the majority of  <dig> smmybs are regulated by a mirna family, whereas the other two, including smmyb <dig> and smmyb <dig>  are targeted by mirnas from two families . smmyb <dig>  which is included in s <dig> and highly expressed in leaves, is a target of the mir <dig> and mir <dig> family members. in s <dig>  there are  <dig> arabidopsis mybs, of which atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are involved in trichome development  <cit> ; however they are not targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the other s <dig> arabidopsis myb, known as atmyb <dig>  is a potential target of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  since functions of atmyb <dig> are currently unknown, the significance of mir828- and mir858-involved co-regulation remains to be elucidated. similarly, smmyb <dig> belonging to s <dig> and predominantly expressed in flowers is co-regulated by members of mir159/ <dig> and mir <dig>  further analyzing the regulation role of mirnas in  <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs included in s <dig> showed that all of them could be targets of mirnas. of  <dig> mybs, smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are regulated by mir <dig>  smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are targets of mir <dig>  smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  smmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are regulated by mir <dig> and mir <dig> and mir <dig>  all smmybs in s <dig> were predominantly expressed in flowers  and atmybs in the subgroup were involved in anther development  <cit> . taken together, the results suggest the conserved regulatory mechanism of mirna-myb module in flower development in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis.

the  <dig> mirna-targeted smmybs distribute in  <dig> subgroups . targets of mir <dig> are included in s <dig> and s <dig>  targets of mir <dig> belong to s <dig> and s <dig>  mir858-regulated smmybs widely distribute in  <dig> subgroups. it suggests the significance of mirnas in regulating multiple cellular processes. except s <dig> and s <dig>  each of other  <dig> subgroups was regulated by only a mirna family. it is consistent with the fact that mybs in a subgroup show high sequence similarity and usually play redundant roles.

smmybs potentially involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds
s. miltiorrhiza bunge is a widely used chinese medicinal material. the main bioactive compounds in s. miltiorrhiza are terpenoid tanshinones and phenolic acids. various r2r3-mybs were found to regulate the biosynthesis of terpenoids. for instance, atmyb <dig> included in s <dig> is involved in gibberellin metabolism and signaling and affect root architecture, pi uptake and acid phosphatase activity  <cit> . grapevine vvmyb5b belonging to s <dig> is involved in flavonoid and terpenoid metabolism. overexpression of vvmyb5b resulted in the down-regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism whereas up-regulation of carotenoid metabolism  <cit> . loblolly pine ptmyb <dig> belonging to s <dig> is a putative regulator of an isoprenoid-oriented response that leads to the accumulation of sesquiterpene in conifers  <cit> . it implies that smmybs belonging to subgroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are potential regulators of terpenoid biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza. since terpenoid biosynthesis-related plant mybs have not been systematically investigated, it is possible that some smmybs in other subgroups are also involved in terpenoid biosynthesis.

phenolic acids are the other main group of bioactive compounds in s. miltiorrhiza. the main pathways leading to the formation of these compounds start with the aromatic amino acids l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine. so far, a large number of r2r3-mybs belonging to various subgroups, including s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  have been found to affect the biosynthesis of these compounds. s <dig> mybs, such as atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  were shown to activate pal, c4h, 4cl and various other genes involved in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . smmyb <dig> belongs to the same subgroup and is predominately expressed in s. miltiorrhiza stems , implying the role of smmyb <dig> in lignin biosynthesis. the other mybs involved in lignin deposition are members of s <dig> and s <dig>  <cit> . s <dig> includes  <dig> smmybs and  <dig> atmybs . atmyb <dig> is a repressor of c4h. down-regulation of atmyb <dig> increased transcript levels of comt gene involved in lignin biosynthesis and reduced the levels of dfr and ans genes associated with proanthocyanidin biosynthesis  <cit> . s <dig> mybs, atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  are involved in the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins and tannins in arabidopsis seeds. additionally, atmyb <dig> is also involved in trichome development  <cit> . it indicate the role of  <dig> smmybs  belonging to s <dig> and smmyb <dig> included in s <dig> in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. all of s <dig> atmybs, including atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> , implying that smmyb <dig> belonging to the same subgroup is also involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. smmyb <dig> is clustered into s <dig> with atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> controlling flavonoid biosynthesis in arabidopsis <cit> . thus, smmyb <dig> is a potential regulator of flavonol biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza. further analysis of smmybs through genetic transformation will definitely shed lights on the regulatory mechanism of bioactive compound biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the myb gene family is the largest transcription factor family in plants. it plays significant roles in plant development, secondary metabolism, and stress responses. the identification and characterization of  <dig> smmyb genes provides a foundation for understanding the regulatory mechanism of mybs in s. miltiorrhiza. through the comprehensive classification and comparative analysis of the r2r3-myb gene family in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis, we showed the conservation and diversity of mybs in plants. the distribution of residues in the myb domain of s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-mybs is quite similar to arabidopsis, although the patterns at various positions are different. a total of  <dig> motifs were identified in downstream of the myb domain of smmybs and atmybs. among them,  <dig> exist in both smmybs and atmybs,  <dig> are atmyb-specific. based on the phylogenetic tree and previous results from arabidopsis <cit> , smmybs and atmybs were classified into  <dig> subgroups, of which  <dig> include proteins from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis, whereas  <dig> are specific to s. miltiorrhiza and  <dig> are specific to arabidopsis. many s. miltiorrhiza r2r3-mybs in a subgroup share at least a motif. smmybs were differentially expressed in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of s. miltiorrhiza. the expression profiles are largely consistent with known functions of their arabidopsis counterparts. we identified  <dig> smmybs to be targets of mirnas belonging to the mir159/r <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families. among them,  <dig> are regulated by a mirna family, while the other  <dig> are co-regulated by mirnas from two families. the regulatory mechanism of mirna-myb module is also conserved in arabidopsis. mirna-targeted smmybs are widely distributed in different subgroups, suggesting the significance of mirnas in regulating multiple cellular processes. based on functional conservation of smmybs and atmybs, we predicted some functions of various smmybs. smmybs in s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> are potential regulators of terpenoid biosynthesis, whereas those in s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> appear to be involved in phenolic acid biosynthesis. our results suggest the significant and complexity of myb regulatory networks in s. miltiorrhiza and provide useful information for improving the growth and defense abilities and the production of bioactive compounds in s. miltiorrhiza.
