BACKGROUND
lrr-rlks  comprise the largest group within the rlk  superfamily in plants. among the more than  <dig> rlk genes identified in the arabidopsis genome, over half are lrr-rlks <cit> . the lrr-rlks can be grouped into  <dig> subfamilies   <cit> . although the functions of most lrr-rlks remain undiscovered, it has been suggested that plant lrr-rlks can be divided into two broad functional categories  <cit> . that is, some appear to function in plant growth and developmental processes such as morphogenesis, organogenesis and hormone signaling, while others appear to be primarily involved in mediating responses to biotic or abiotic stresses and therefore can be said to be defense-related. some lrr-rlks have been demonstrated to possess dual functions, either through signaling pathway cross-talk or due to their ability to recognize multiple ligands  <cit> . well known examples of lrr-rlks involved in the regulation of plant growth and development are the clv <dig> -clv <dig> -wus  signaling system in the sam  and the similar, cle <dig> -clv1-acr <dig> -wox <dig>  signaling system in the ram   <cit> . in the sam, the clv <dig> lrr-rlk is essential for maintaining a balance between stem cell division and differentiation, and therefore, growth control in the shoot  <cit> . loss of clv <dig> leads to the accumulation of undifferentiated cells in the sam. three other lrr-rlks that operate in the sam, the bam  proteins, form a monophyletic group with clv <dig>  are also involved in maintaining meristem function. although clv <dig> and the bams both operate in maintaining sam function, their expression profiles and functions differ. in contrast to clv <dig>  the loss of bam function leads to a reduction in the number of undifferentiated cells  <cit> . clearly, lrr-rlks fulfill multiple roles in complex processes such as meristem function.

lrr-rlks have now been shown to be involved in all three major plant meristems, the sam and ram, and the vascular cambium, that produces cells for secondary vascular development. in arabidopsis, a signaling system consisting of a small cle peptide, the tdif , and its receptor pxy/tdr  regulates the behavior of vascular stem cells  <cit> . genetic analyses showed that at least two pathways diverge early in tdif-pxy/tdr signaling and the wox <dig> , which belongs to the wus subclade in the wox family  <cit> , is required for promoting the proliferation of procambial/cambial stem cells but not for repressing their commitment to xylem differentiation in response to the tdif signal  <cit> . correct spatial separation of the expression of the genes encoding pxy/tdr and tdif, is essential for generating the spatial cues necessary for ordered secondary vascular development <cit> .

as the only well described pathway so far, the tdif-pxy/tdr signal transduction pathway has been suggested to be required both very early in vascular development to orientate the polarity of the vascular bundle, and continuously throughout development to regulate the process  <cit> . ectopic expression of tdif-related genes results in pleiotropic phenotypes including a bushy appearance with small leaves  <cit> . recently, tdif and cle <dig> peptide were found to have an in vivo activity to enhance axillary bud formation and there are indications that pxy/tdr is involved in this process  <cit> . together, these results indicate that the tdif ligand-pxy/tdr signal transduction pathway is an important regulator of multiple developmental processes  <cit> .

given the size of the lrr-rlk gene family and the evidence of multiple active lrr-rlks in the sam, it is likely that other multiple lrr-rlks are involved in the complex process of secondary vascular development. in this work, we aimed to identify lrr-rlks other than pxy/tdr that contribute to secondary vascular development through interactions, direct or indirect, with the tdif-pxy/tdr pathway. given the importance of the localization of gene expression for pxy/tdr function, we initially performed an in silico co-expression and functional clustering analyses. three lrr-rlks  were identified that had similar transcript profiles to pxy/tdr. we named them pxc for pxy/tdr-correlated genes. evidence from loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses showed that pxc <dig> in particular plays a tdif-pxy/tdr associated role in the process of secondary cell formation in fiber cells.

RESULTS
co-expression profiling and functional clustering analyses identified three atlrr-rlks associated with pxy/tdr
in order to develop our understanding of the functions of atlrr-rlks in vascular development, a hierarchical cluster analyses using the microarray data in the genevestigator database was performed for all atlrr-rlks <cit> . the dendrogram in additional file  <dig> was used to assess transcript profile similarities between the genes. six out of the  <dig> genes that clustered with pxy/tdr exhibited preferential expression in the vasculature, with the highest transcript levels occuring in the stem, apex and floral organs . of the  <dig>  mol <dig> , rul <dig>  and vh <dig>  have already been reported for their vascular functions  <cit> . the other three, at2g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at2g <dig> are largely uncharacterised. we named the genes as pxc pxy/tdr-correlated genes, pxc <dig> , pxc <dig> , and pxc <dig> . tair database information of these three genes indicated that they may be broadly functional. for example, pxc <dig> displayed a decreased expression level in the arabidopsis leaves treated by salt  <cit>  and pxc <dig> appear to be down-regulated in arabidopsis seedlings under anoxia  <cit> . for pxc <dig>  its transcription was dramatically repressed in arabidopsis cell suspensions upon salicylic acid treatment  <cit> . in an investigation into the roles of lrr-rlks in arabidopsis root development, germination of a line mutated in pxc <dig>  n <dig> was shown to be resistant to salt  and osmotic stress. a pxc <dig> mutant allele was found to be sensitive to darkness and resistant to osmotic stress treatment   <cit> . together, the results suggest a role for the arabidopsis pxc genes in defense and other stress-related responses. a putative soybean ortholog of pxc <dig>  gmlrk <dig> gene has been studied in some detail  <cit> . mutating gmlrk <dig> led to reduced lignification in leaf cells and defective leaf cell elongation. the authors hypothesized that gmlrk1is is involved in the regulation of cell expansion by influencing the development of cell wall architecture  <cit> .

in order to further explore the possibility of a role for the three pxc genes in vasculature development, we developed a putative gene co-regulation network using the atted-ii suite of programs   <cit>  . the analyses led to the identification of a putative relationship between pxy/tdr and pxc <dig> . the homeobox transcription factor, athb <dig> , that is regarded as a procambium and protoxylem cell identity marker, appeared to be similarly associated with pxy/tdr and pxc <dig> <cit> . pxc <dig> also correlated strongly with genes encoding enzymes involved in the cell expansion process . the pxc <dig> gene correlated with pxc <dig> and with revoluta . athb <dig> and rev are class iii hd-zip transcriptional regulators and both play important roles in vascular differentiation  <cit> . cle <dig>  that encodes the peptide ligand for the pxy/tdr receptor  <cit> , was located between pxc <dig> and pxc <dig> in the coexpression network . the bioinformatic data, therefore, indicated connections between pxy/tdr, and the three pxc proteins in vascular development.

expression patterns of pxy and three pxc genes in vascular tissues
in order to further explore the associations between pxc1/2/ <dig> and pxy/tdr, we examined their respective expression patterns using a native promoter-driven gus  reporter system. pxy/tdr has been reported to be expressed in the vasculature of a variety of organs including leaves, roots and the stem  <cit> . its expression has been shown to be confined to the procambial cells in the developing vascular bundles  <cit> . the pattern of gus activity observed in the ppxy::gus was similar to the pattern oberseved in the ppxc1::gus, ppxc2::gus, and ppxc3::gus lines. specifically, gus was observed primarily in the vascular strands in cotyledons, the shoot apex, hypocotyls, roots and leaves . in the inflorescence stems of the ppxy::gus line, gus was observed in the protoxylem, procambial cells and in the interfascicular cambial regions . in the ppxc1::gus line, gus staining was observed primarily in the developing xylem of both inflorescence stem and hypocotyl . pxc <dig> expression overlapped with pxy expression in the basal stem, except that the staining was very faint in protoxylem . in ppxc2::gus plants, gus staining in the inflorescence stem was primarily observed in the differentiating vessel cells . the gus staining pattern in the secondary vasculature of the ppxc3::gus plants was similar to that of ppxy::gus, except that in pxc3::gus, no gus was not expressed in the interfascicular region . the gus staining of the four lines diverged in the roots. gus was observed in the root tip in the ppxc2::gus line, close to the quiescent center in the ppxc1::gus and ppxc3::gus lines and in the elongation zone in the ppxy::gus line   <cit> . in contrast to the similarities in the gus staining patterns in the vascular tissues, there was little similarity between the gus outside these tissues  .

expression levels of pxc <dig> in vascular tissues
because the strongest predicted links were between pxc <dig> and pxy/tdr, we concentrated our efforts on this gene. to further investigate the function of pxc <dig> in vascular development, transcript levels of pxc <dig> were determined in parallel with seven known regulators of vascular development in different plant tissues including the leaf lamina , petiole, young inflorescence stem, old inflorescence stem and hypocotyl. our data showed that the transcripts for pxy were most abundant in the xylem fraction of hypocotyls, with levels increasing in older inflorescence stems . expression patterns for hb <dig>  hb <dig>  and nst <dig>  were similar to those observed for pxy . hb <dig> and hb <dig> are both recognized as molecular markers of procambial cells  <cit>  and nst <dig> encodes a known regulator of secondary cell wall formation in xylem fibers  <cit> . interestingly, the qrt-pcr data also indicated a similar expression pattern between pxc <dig> and wox <dig>  with the highest level of transcript observed in young stem . cle <dig> and cle <dig> both encode the b-type cle peptides that act as the ligands for the tdif-pxy/tdr signal transduction pathway  <cit> . as previously reported, the cle <dig> transcript was found to be mainly associated with the phloem fraction   <cit> . this fraction may, however, include some cambium cells as a result of the sample collection  method used  <cit> . cle <dig> transcript appeared more evenly distributed among the tissue fractions, with a significantly lower level of transcripts in the xylem tissue , which is consistent with the recent report of phloem-specific expression of cle44::gus <cit> . to summarize the expression patterns described above, a heat map was generated using the qpcr data. strikingly, the heat map highlighted the similarities between pxc <dig> and wox <dig> in vascular tissues .

loss of pxc <dig> function suppresses secondary cell wall formation in xylem fibers
the pxc <dig> gene encodes a predicted protein containing a putative kinase domain and an extracellular domain with  <dig> leucine-rich repeats . the predicted pxc <dig> belongs to the lrr-rlk subfamily iii  <cit>  along with clv <dig>  and pxy/tdr . protein motif search in the pfam and smart databases predicted that the kinase domain of pxc <dig> resembles that of the animal receptor tyrosine kinase domain, which is an unusual characteristic for a plant rlk  <cit> . phosphorylation of the soybean homologue of pxc <dig>  has been demonstrated to be induced by plant protein extracts, which suggested that some plant proteins may interact with gmlrk <dig> and phosphorylate it in vivo <cit> . based on the high degree of sequence divergence between pxc <dig> and other subfamilies of lrr-rlks, no firm prediction can be made as to its functional role.

three t-dna insertion lines were identified for pxc <dig> in the nasc  mutant collection, including two salk lines and one wiscdslox t-dna line. these three alleles were designated as pxc1- <dig> , pxc1- <dig> , and pxc1- <dig> , respectively. both pxc1- <dig> and pxc1- <dig> contain insertions in the coding sequence, while pxc1- <dig> has a t-dna inserted in the 3'-utr . results of qpcr analyses using a gene specific primer set located in the 3’-utr indicated that the level of pxc <dig> mrna in three mutants was pxc1- <dig> >pxc1- <dig> >pxc1- <dig> . pxc1- <dig> displayed only background level of pxc <dig> expression, suggesting that this allele might represent a null mutant . several aspects of plant morphology were affected by the mutation of pxc <dig>  the inflorescence stems of the pxc <dig> mutants were taller than those of the wild-type, with the phenotype most pronounced in the pxc1- <dig> line . by contrast, the inflorescence stem of pxy mutant plants were shorter than the wild-type  <cit> . when grown under long-day conditions, pxc <dig> mutants did not show significant difference from the wild-type in terms of cellular morphology as seen from transverse sections of the inflorescence stem . secondary vascular development is enhanced in the inflorescence stems of arabidopsis when plants are grown under long day conditions  and transferred to short-day conditions  immediately after bolting. in both wild-type and pxc1- <dig> plants, the inflorescence stem grew vertically from this point. in contrast, the stems of pxc1- <dig> and pxc1- <dig> plants were unable to support the weight of the continued upright growth of the stem . ligin staining in cross sections taken from the base of pxc1- <dig>  pxc1- <dig> and wild-type inflorescent stems indicated that the two mutant lines were defective in vascular lignification , which then provided an explanation to the inability of the inflorescence stem to support an upright growth. tissue polarity in the pxc <dig> mutants appeared to be retained, as opposed to the polarity phenotype in the pxy mutant . secondary cell wall thicking in fiber cells was also considerably reduced in pxc1- <dig> plants and absent from pxc1- <dig> plants , indicating a reduced capacity for secondary cell wall synthesis and lignifications in the pxc <dig> mutants . the vascular bundles of the long day grown plants and those shifted from long to short days wer compared by close-ups in figure  <dig>  interestingly, pxc <dig> has been identified in the repertoire of genes regulated by snd <dig>  which is an indirect target of a principal regulator of fiber secondary cell wall formation, snd <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of snd <dig> produced a fiber cell-specific increase in secondary cell wall thickness in arabidopsis stems and pxc <dig> was slightly up-regulated in this transgenic line  <cit> . thus, the reduced cell wall thickness in the interfascicular fiber cell of pxc1- <dig> and pxc1- <dig> mutants indicated that pxc <dig> is likely playing a role in secondary cell wall formation of fiber cells.

the interactions between pxc <dig> and tdif-pxy/tdr signaling pathway
qpcr analysis of pxy, pxc <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig> and wox <dig> expression was analyzed in the pxy/tdr, pxc <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig> and wox <dig> mutants. transcript abundances of pxy and cle <dig> were not dramatically affected in the pxy/tdr, pxc <dig> and wox <dig> knockout lines . the transcript level of pxc <dig>  wox <dig> and cle <dig> were significantly increased in pxy, pxc <dig> and wox <dig> mutants compared to the wild-type . the elevated expression level of wox <dig> in the pxy background was unexpected since that wox <dig> is a key downstream target of the tdif-pxy/tdr signaling pathway  <cit> . this result indicated a possibility that pxy might not be the only receptor acting upstream of wox <dig>  meanwhile, instead of young seedlings  <cit> , 5-week-old hypocotyls, which contain more secondary growth, were used in this study and the implication of pxy/tdr in xylem development has not been investigated in details. the dramatic increase in pxc <dig> transcripts occurred in the pxy and wox <dig> knockout mutants indicated that either the pxy-wox <dig> pathway negatively regulate the expression of pxc <dig>  or that pxc <dig> is upregulated in these mutants as a compensatory measure . these data also suggested that the signal transduction pathways mediated by pxy and pxc <dig> are at least partly overlapping. however, it is hard to specify the position of pxc <dig> relative to the tdif/pxy/wox <dig> pathway because we could not judge which alterations in gene expression resulting from forward responses or feedback responses.

as opposed to the expression profiles of plants grown under long-day conditions, the short-day shift experiment induced a strong decrease in pxy/tdr and wox <dig> transcript levels in the inflorescence stems of the pxc <dig> mutants, particularly in the pxc1- <dig> line . the reduced capacity to produce an interfascicular cambium in the pxc <dig> mutants may explain the reduction in pxy/tdr and wox <dig> transcript levels, or vice versa, the reduced expression of pxy/tdr and wox <dig> may be the underlying cause of the lack of interfascicular cambium. future research will attempt to answer this question. it has been reported that the exogenous application of the tdif/cle41/ <dig> peptide ligand resulted in an increase in the transcript levels of hb <dig>  hb <dig>  wox <dig> and pxy genes  <cit> . we similarly over-expressed cle <dig> in arabidopsis and analyzed its effects on pxc <dig> transcript levels. three cle44ox lines exhibiting from  <dig> to 85-fold increases in cle <dig> transcript levels compared to wild-type level were identified and analyzed . these lines exhibited similar phenotypes to the cle41ox and cle42ox lines reported previously  <cit> . transcripts for pxc <dig>  pxy/tdr, wox <dig>  hb- <dig> and rev were elevated compared to wild-type plants in all three of our cle44ox lines . once again, the explanation may be that the changes in gene expression are the result of developmental abnormalities. that is to say that the affected genes might not be directly regulated by cle <dig> over-expression, but the result of changes in cellular composition, such as an increase in the abundance of dividing/undifferentiated cells in the transgenic line . however, the similarities between pxc <dig> and elements in the tdif-pxy/tdr pathway indicate that pxc <dig> functions synergistically with the tdif-pxy/tdr signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
lrr-rlk receptors have been shown to mediate multiple signal transduction pathways. it is clear from work in the sam that the combined actions of multiple lrr-rlks, each with defined functions, are required to maintain the balance between stem cell division and differentiation in meristems. in vascular tissue, tdif-pxy/tdr signal transduction pathway plays multiple roles in xylem development including the promotion of cambial cell division and repression of xylogenesis  <cit> . in this work, from in silico analyses, a new lrr-rlk component involved in the regulation of plant vasculature development, pxc <dig>  was introduced with its expression patterns correlated to that of pxy gene. pxc <dig> probably plays its roles in a regulatory network which also incorporates the pxy/tdr-wox <dig> signaling pathway and regulates the maturation of interfascicular fiber cells. the co-regulation network suggested that the loss of pxc <dig> function might retard the initiation of secondary cell wall deposition by prolonging the course of cell wall remodeling and reorganization during the procedure of cell expansion.

materials and methods
expression profiling, co-expression analyses and gene functional clustering
microarray expression data sets were explored for the predicted atlrr-rlk genes using the arabidopsis affymetrix genechip® average data available on the genevestigator analysis tool site   <cit> . the gene co-expression analysis  toolbox at http://genecat.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ainitiator.py <cit>  was used to generate the expression tree which clustered genes by the similarity of their expression profiles and visualized those similarities using a dendogram. to minimize the effects of experimental artifacts, data were renormalized, and pearson’s correlation coefficient between genes was weighted in atted-ii  <cit> .

identification of loss-of-function mutants and construction of transgenic arabidopsis
seeds for segregating t <dig> plants harboring the pxc <dig> alleles in the col- <dig> ecotype background were obtained from the nasc , and subcloned into the pk2gw <dig> vector using the gateway cloning system . native promoter::gus-gfp fusion constructs were made for pxy and pxc1/2/ <dig> by cloning the amplified promoter regions into the binary vector pkgwfs7™  <cit> via pdonr <dig> . vectors were then transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv <dig> . arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip method  <cit> . positive transgenic arabidopsis plants were selected based on kanamycin resistance conferred by the t-dna. t <dig> seeds from at least  <dig> independent positive lines for each construct were harvested for expression analyses.

histochemistry
plant tissues at various developmental stages were vacuum-infiltrated for  <dig> min in gus solution including  <dig> mm x-gluc,  <dig> mm sodium phosphate ,  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm potassium ferricyanide and  <dig> mm potassium ferrocyanide, and incubated at 37°c overnight. destaining of the samples were performed by incubation in  <dig>  m hcl and 20% meoh solution at 55°c for  <dig> min, then in 7% naoh and 60% etoh solution at room temperature for  <dig> min. the samples were dehydrated through ethanol series . for sectioning, samples were embedded in 4%  agar and sectioned at  <dig> μm with a vibratome . samples were then mounted in glycerol and analyzed by bright field transmitted microscopy using an axioplan  <dig> microscope . images were captured by axiocam hrc and axiovision software .

safranin/alcian-blue staining
plants were grown under long day conditions and then were moved into short day conditions right after bolting. long day conditions were 16h light/8h dark, 75% humidity,  <dig> μe of irradiance and short day conditions were  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark, 75% humidity,  <dig> μe of irradiance. for sectioning, samples were embedded in 4%  agar, and sectioned at  <dig> μm with a vibratome . sections were then stained in one part safranin  and two parts alcian-blue  in  <dig> % glacial acetic acid. the sections were subsequently rinsed in ddh2o and mounted in 50% glycerol. slide-mounted sections were viewed using a zeiss axioplan  <dig> compound microscope with a zeiss axiocamhrc digital camera .

gene expression analyses by quantitative pcr
all samples came from five-week-old wild type plants under long-day conditions when the inflorescence stems reached a height of  <dig> cm, except that stem <dig> was from younger plants whose inflorescence was  <dig> cm high. fully expanded leaves were harvested without the midrib, and petioles were harvested from the fully expanded leaves. stem <dig>  and stem <dig>  were both from the basal part of the inflorescence stems at 1– <dig> cm above the rosette. all nodes were removed from the stem samples. the phloem and xylem samples were obtained simply by separating the bark/phloem from the xylem core. total rna  was used for cdna synthesis using the thermoscript rt-pcr kit . real-time qpcr was performed with the lightcycler instrument . each mrna value was corrected by the measurements obtained in the same sample for 18s mrna and elongation factor  <dig>  using delta delta method  <cit> . the primer sequences utilized in this study were listed in additional file  <dig>  each amplification included three technical replicates and their results were averaged to give the value for a single biological replicate. three biological replicates were prepared for each treatment using material harvested from 10– <dig> plants in each case. the means of relative expression for each sample were examined using one-way analysis of variance  method .
