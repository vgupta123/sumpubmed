BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig> million years ago, several pioneering green algal ancestors, probably related to charales  <cit> , spread out from water to occupy a new bio-geographical niche: dry land. this colonisation of dry land was accompanied by the need to deal with important stresses including desiccation, uv radiation, as well as attack by already diversified microbial soil communities. this led to a number of physiological adaptations, including the evolutionary emergence of entirely new specialized secondary metabolic pathways  <cit> . one in particular was crucial: the phenylpropanoid pathway, which represents a ubiquitous and specific trait of land plants providing vital compounds such as lignin and flavonoids  <cit> . lignin is a structural polymer important for the structural integrity necessary for the emergence of self-supporting structures. flavonoids, which often impart a species-specific chemical ‘signature’ upon an organism, serve vital roles in the protection of plants against biotic and abiotic stresses, reproduction and internal regulation of cell physiology and signalling  <cit> .

the role of phenylpropanoid compounds in defence appears to be restricted to a minor class of compounds that are often referred to as phytoalexins. the term “phytoalexins” probably derives from the greek language and means “warding off agents in plants” and refers to low mass, lipophilic, antimicrobial compounds that not only accumulate rapidly at the site of interaction with incompatible pathogens  <cit>  but also accumulate in response to abiotic stresses such as exposure to uv light, wounding or treatment with chemicals such as salts and heavy metals, respiratory inhibitors and surfactants  <cit> . because of the agricultural and economic importance of grapevine as a crop plant, the strategies it uses to defend against phyto-pathogenic organisms, as well as deal with abiotic stresses, has attracted considerable interest in recent times. amongst the arsenal of defence mechanisms available to grapevine cells is the production of phytoalexins. phytoalexins from the vitaceae family have been the subject of numerous studies over the past decade, not only because of their biological activities in planta, but also because of their possible pharmacological applications.

although phytoalexins display an enormous chemical diversity throughout the plant kingdom, in grapevine they constitute a rather restricted group of molecules belonging to the “stilbene family”  <cit> . plant stilbenes, together with flavonoids, belong to the class of compounds called polyketides, which represents a major group of phenylpropanoids derived from the extension of the activated form of coumaric acid with three acetyl moieties. apart from the vitaceae, stilbenes have been detected in at least  <dig> unrelated plant species distributed among  <dig> genera and  <dig> families including fagaceae, liliaceae, moraceae, myrtaceae, papilionaceae, pinaceae, and poaceae  <cit> . despite the multiplicity of forms detected in these different plants, most plant stilbenes, including those ones detected in grapevine, are derivatives of the basic unit trans-resveratrol . in addition to resveratrol, more complex compounds derived from its modification have also been detected in grapevine such as cis- and trans- piceid  <cit> , viniferins, which represent oligomers arising from the oxidative coupling of resveratrol, pterostilbene  <cit>  and piceatannol  <cit> .

several plant species, such as polygonum cuspidatum and pinus spp. constitutively accumulate large amount of stilbenes  <cit> . however, the majority of studies conducted on cells and leaves of peanut, grapevine and pine seedlings have shown that stilbenes are present at only very low levels under normal conditions, but strongly accumulate in response to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses as a result of an increased transcription of their biosynthetic genes and the co-ordinated activation of upstream genes belonging to the general phenylpropanoid pathway, such as pal and c4h. these abiotic stress treatments include mechanical damage  <cit> , uv-c light irradiation  <cit> , treatments with chemicals such as aluminium ions, cyclodextrins and ozone  <cit>  and the application of plant hormones like ethylene and jasmonates  <cit> . in terms of biotic stresses, the biosynthesis of stilbenes in grapevine tissues is also particularly well documented, with the accumulation of stilbenic compounds reported following infection with a range of different pathogens, including powdery mildew   <cit> , downy mildew   <cit> , gray mold   <cit>  and aspergillus carbonarius <cit> .

stilbene synthase  is the key enzyme leading to the biosynthesis of resveratrol and stilbenes and was firstly extracted and purified from stressed cell suspension cultures of peanut   <cit> . it belongs to the type iii polyketide synthase super family, of which chalcone synthase  represents the archetypal enzyme. the enzyme is a dimer of estimated molecular weight 90 kda with an iso-electric point  of  <dig> . a conserved cysteine residue, located in the central section of these proteins has been shown to be essential for the catalytic activity of both sts and chs enzymes and represents the binding site for the p-coumaroyl-coa starting substrate  <cit> . the region around this active site is well conserved and can be used as a signature pattern for chs and sts. the two proteins show a high degree of similarity based on sequence homology , and on the comparison of their crystallographic structures  <cit> , suggesting that sts independently evolved from chs several times in the course of evolution  <cit> . stss, which, in contrast with the ubiquitous chss, are only present in stilbene-producing plants, catalyse the formation, in a single enzymatic reaction, of exactly the same linear tetraketide intermediate  produced by chs in the flavonoid pathway, but with a different cyclization that leads to the production of stilbenes rather than chalcones .

to date, sts genes have been cloned from peanut , scots pine , eastern white pine , japanese red pine , grapevine  and sorghum . in many of these plant species stss exist as a family of closely related genes. for example, two sts genes have been found in peanut and eastern white pine  <cit> , scots pine has a small multigene family of at least five pynosylvin synthase genes   <cit>  and japanese red pine possesses three members   <cit> . apart from sorghum, for which only one sts member has been identified  <cit> , grapevine represents the only stilbene producing plant species for which the entire genome has been sequenced  <cit> . forty-three vvsts members were predicted with gaze and jigsaw prediction tools in the  <dig>  x coverage genome draft of the pn <dig> genotype   <cit>  while only twenty-one members were predicted from the genome sequence of the pn entav  <dig> genotype   <cit> . sparvoli et al.  <cit>  performing a molecular characterization of structural genes involved in anthocyanins and stilbene biosynthesis in v. vinifera has previously hypothesized that these gene families probably arose from the same ancestral gene and that subsequent gene duplications and molecular divergence may have contributed to the establishment of functionally distinct genes.

this aim of this study was to clarify the genome organization of the entire sts family in grapevine and investigate the transcriptional response of each vvsts member in different grapevine tissues, at different developmental stages and under different stress conditions, in order to determine if this gene family evolved into different sub-groups characterized by specific role in the response to different stresses or in the plant development.

RESULTS
identification, annotation and chromosomal distribution of grapevine sts genes
the genome sequence of the near-homozygous pn <dig> genotype of the v. vinifera cv. pinot noir was searched for predicted sts gene sequences. these were predicted on the genome draft by combining ab initio models together with v. vinifera complementary dna sequences, such as est databases and alignment of gene/protein models from other species  <cit> . the hidden markov model  for the chs/sts active site  was obtained from prosite and used in a blastp search against the  <dig> x, 12x v <dig> and 12x v <dig> proteome databases. in order to extend the search to identify putative gene family members not predicted by the gaze and jigsaw software programs, a tblastx search of the hmm and of the entire amino acid sequence of previously identified vvsts was also performed against the genome sequence. fifty-one hits were obtained. three predictions carrying the chs/sts hmm were found to encode for chalcone synthase genes and were excluded leaving a total of forty-eight putative vvsts gene sequences. these sequences were designated as vvsts <dig> to vvsts <dig> based on their chromosomal position . vvsts1- <dig> are located in a region of approximately  <dig> kb on chr <dig>  whereas vvsts7- <dig> reside on chr <dig>  within a  <dig> kb region. five sequences corresponding to genes designated as vvsts11vvsts14vvsts34vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> fall in genome regions which are not predicted to contain any gene based on gaze and jigsaw prediction tools.

genes have been named from vvsts <dig> to vvsts <dig> based on the chromosomal location. the chromosomal location and corresponding identifier on the 12x v <dig> coverage are also provided. the predicted open reading frame  prediction was assigned as follows: yes: genes encoding a complete orf; unsure: genes for which it was not possible to determine with certainty whether they encode a full length or truncated orf based on available sequence information from the pn <dig> and pn entav  <dig> genotypes and specifically matching paired-end reads obtained from the whole-transcriptome sequencing of pinot noir clone 115; no: genes encoding for a truncated orf.

although the genoscope integrated method for deducing proteins is very exhaustive, some gene models were found to be incorrect based on available est sequences and when compared with cloned vvsts cds sequences already deposited on the genbank database. with particular reference to the 12x v <dig> coverage assembly, the predictions designated as vv10s0042g <dig>  vv10s0042g <dig> and vv10s0042g <dig> are listed as three different genes in the proteome database, but our analysis indicates they represent one single unique vvsts gene, designated as vvsts <dig> . a similar observation was made for the predictions vv10s0042g <dig> and vv10s0042g <dig>  which also represent a single gene designated as vvsts <dig>  the opposite situation was observed for genes designated as vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig>  which are represented by the same prediction vv16s100g <dig>  genomic sequences of five genes, vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> were obtained by corresponding sequences from the pn entav  <dig> genome sequence because of gaps in the pn <dig> assembly.

based on the deduced amino acid sequences obtained from genoscope predictions and from manual analysis using vector nti software, several vvsts proteins were found to be truncated because of snp/mutations leading to premature stop codons or in/del mutations causing frame-shifts and changes in the protein primary structure. in order to investigate whether these observations were limited to the pn <dig> genotype used by the french-italian consortium or were also detectable in other genotypes, the closest sequences in the pn entav  <dig> genotype and specifically matching paired-end reads obtained from the whole-transcriptome sequencing of pinot noir clone  <dig>  were screened for these mutations . based on available sequence information it was not possible to determine with absolute certainty whether vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig> or vvsts <dig> encode a complete orf. vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> were predicted to have premature stop codons in all three genotypes screened or in both the pn <dig> and pn entav  <dig> where no specific paired-end reads were available. vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> represent gene fragments of  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt respectively with the upstream and downstream sequences not coding for sts. finally vvsts <dig> was predicted to be a coding gene based on the fact that at least one allele at this locus was predicted to encode a complete orf based on the three genotypes sequences screened.

the genomic sequences of the vvsts genes detected in the pn <dig> genome ranged in size from a minimum length of  <dig> nt  to a maximum of  <dig> nt  depending on the length of the single introns present in all members within the triplet coding for cys- <dig>  deduced protein length for all  <dig> full-length coding genes was  <dig> aa , whilst of those pseudogenes that possessed the chs/sts active site  vvsts <dig> encodes for a  <dig> aa product, vvsts <dig> for a  <dig> aa product , vvsts <dig> for a  <dig> aa product and vvsts <dig> for a  <dig> aa product. all other genes give products lacking the active site and were considered non functional.

phylogenetic analyses of the deduced vvsts proteins
in order to examine the phylogenetic relationship between the predicted vvsts proteins a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the e-insi tool of the mafft  <dig>  software as described in the tutorial for the grapevine genome annotation  provided by the international grape genome program  steering committee. gene members encoding a truncated orf were not included in the alignment, but for vvsts genes where both coding and non-coding alleles had been identified in different genotypes, the coding orfs were also included in the analyses. the three vvchs proteins corresponding to vvchs <dig> , vvchs <dig>  and vvchs <dig> , respectively vv14s0068g <dig>  vv14s <dig> and vv05s0136g <dig> in the 12x v <dig> assembly of the pn <dig> genotype, were also included in the analysis to ascertain the evolutionary relationships between vvsts and vvchs proteins. figure  <dig> shows that vvsts proteins cluster in three main sub-families, which have been designated as groups a, b and c. group a is composed entirely of those members located on the chr <dig> , while groups b and c are composed of  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively all positioned on chr <dig>  the three vvchs proteins were found to cluster outside the tree as outgroups.

microarray analysis of vvsts and vvchs expression during grapevine development and post-harvest berry withering
the expression pattern of vvsts genes encoding a complete orf were analysed in a global v. vinifera cv. corvina gene expression atlas of different organs at various developmental stages . although vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> were predicted to encode a full-length protein, these genes were excluded from the expression analyses as they are represented by the same prediction in the reference genome, which could lead to incorrect estimations of the expression values for these genes. the expression atlas was generated using a microarray technology based on gene predictions obtained from the 12x v <dig> coverage assembly of the pn <dig> genotype. figure  <dig> shows a graphical representation of the expression pattern of each vvsts, together with the three vvchs genes identified in grapevine, and was generated using mev software. raw vvsts and vvchs expression values are reported in additional file  <dig> 

the first thing to note regarding the results shown in figure  <dig> is that the majority of vvsts gene family members show little or no constitutive expression in most grapevine tissues including young leaves, stems, buds, flowers and developing grape berries. the exceptions to this appear to be roots and all stages of rachis development in which members of all three vvsts groups show elevated levels of constitutive expression. as a group, members of vvsts group a also appear to have a higher level of constitutive expression in young leaf  tissues than the majority of members of subgroups b and c.

another important observation regarding vvsts expression in developing grape tissues is that members of all groups are strongly induced during aging or senescence. this was observed in both senescing leaves and in berries undergoing the process of berry withering. berry withering is a post-harvest drying process used specifically with corvina berries for the production of dessert and fortified wines. the drying process leads to alterations in most quality characteristics and an increase in the concentration of simple sugars. berries were sampled for expression analysis after the first, second and third month of the withering phase. the results clearly show a very strong induction of nearly all vvsts family members in the berry pericarp in response to the withering process. this organ appears to accumulate vvsts transcripts within the exocarp tissue, whereas the expression is much lower in berry flesh .

mrna-seq analysis of vvsts and vvchs expression in grape leaves in response to stress
the same vvsts and vvchs gene sequences predicted in the pn <dig> genome sequence and analysed in the grapevine expression atlas  were also studied for their expression under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. in order to overcome the difficulty posed by the high sequence conservation between these genes, which makes it difficult to clearly discriminate between individual members using pcr-based expression analyses, a whole transcriptome  approach was performed using the illumina next generation sequencing  technology. v. vinifera cv pinot noir leaf discs were collected at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after wounding, uv-c exposure and infection with p. viticola. seven pools of rna samples, representing each treatment and the control sample, which was common for all three treatments, were used to build libraries for high-throughput parallel sequencing using an illumina genome analyser ii . each treatment was represented at least by  <dig> million reads, a tag density sufficient for quantitative analysis of gene expression  <cit> .

all three stress treatments resulted in a significant induction of expression of at least some members of the vvsts gene family . of the three stress treatments employed, uv-c exposure led to the highest induction of the majority of vvsts members, followed by downy mildew infection and wounding. the wounding and uv-c responses appeared to peak within 24 h of treatment whereas the downy mildew-treated discs continued to show an increase in vvsts transcription after 48 h, presumably reflecting the establishment of the downy pathogen within the leaf tissue. interestingly, there appeared to be only minor differences in vvsts transcription between wounded and downy mildew-inoculated discs after  <dig> hours indicating that vvsts genes are not induced in the early stages of downy mildew infection prior to haustorial formation.

in agreement with the microarray data shown in figure  <dig>  vvsts genes in group a, unlike those in groups b and c, are characterised by significant levels of constitutive expression in young leaves. furthermore, group a genes are not induced in response to wounding and show only a minor increase in transcription in response to uv-c treatment compared to control discs. in contrast, vvsts genes in group b are highly responsive to abiotic stress treatments with wounding resulting in increases in transcription ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> fold after 24 h. when these discs are also exposed to uv-c light there is a further increase in transcription ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> fold. vvsts genes in group c appear to show transcriptional responses which are intermediate between those of genes in groups a and b.

the relationship between vvsts and vvchs transcription in young leaf tissues subjected to abiotic stress treatments  appears to be somewhat more complicated than was observed for constitutive expression patterns in different grapevine tissues . as observed with vvsts genes in groups b and c, wounding led to an increase in transcription of all three vvchs genes ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  fold after 24 h. however, in accordance with the inverse transcriptional responses of vvsts and vvchs genes observed in a range of different grapevine tissues in figure  <dig>  the further increase in vvsts transcription in response to uv-c treatment was accompanied by an 8– <dig> fold reduction in expression of the vvchs genes  to levels below that found in control discs.

quantitative rt-pcr analyses of selected vvsts members of groups a, b and c and vvchss in stressed leaves
the analysis of mrna-seq data from leaf samples treated by wounding, uv-c exposure and p. viticola infection, together with analysis of gene expression atlas in v. vinifera cv. corvina indicated there are differential expression patterns across different vvsts groups and between members of the vvsts and vvchs polyketide synthase families. to confirm and investigate these observations in more detail, the expression patterns of selected members of the vvsts groups a, b and c i.e. vvsts <dig>  vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> and the three grapevine vvchs genes was monitored using quantitative rt-pcr across a time course series following wounding, uv-c irradiation, and p. viticola inoculation of shiraz leaf tissue .

elongation factor ef <dig> was selected as the reference gene as it was found to be more stable than 18 s and actin in the wounded and uv-c irradiation treatments . figure  <dig> illustrates changes in selected vvstss mrna transcript levels over time in response to the three applied stresses. the qpcr results confirmed the results of the mrna-seq experiment with the group b gene vvsts <dig> showing much higher levels of transcript accumulation than vvsts genes in groups a  and c and  respectively under all stress treatments. however, it is clear from this more detailed expression analysis that vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> display a similar pattern of induction in response to these three stress treatments and that the pattern of induction of these group a and c genes is clearly different to that observed for the group b gene, vvsts <dig>  for example, both vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> show a peak of transcription at 8 h post uv-c treatment. in contrast, vvsts <dig> shows a continual increase in transcript levels over the whole 48-h period following uv-c treatment. this is well illustrated in figure 7a, which shows a comparison of the fold-change in gene expression in response to uv-c treatment for these three vvsts genes. based on this analysis it would appear that vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> actually respond earlier than vvsts <dig> to uv-c treatment. however, it should be noted that the transcriptional activity of vvsts <dig> is such that the level of transcription of this gene in response to wounding alone, at 4 h, is still greater than that observed for vvsts <dig> and vvstst <dig> at 4 h following wounding plus uv-c treatment . indeed, 8 h after uv-c treatment the level of expression of this group b gene is approximately  <dig> and  <dig> fold higher than is observed for the subgroup a and c vvsts genes respectively.

differences in the timing of response of these three vvsts group representatives are also evident from the downy mildew inoculation experiment. in agreement with the mrna-seq data  there appears little transcriptional response from three vvsts genes to downy mildew infection within the first 24 h. however, from  <dig> hpi both vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> show a marked increase in transcription peaking at  <dig> hpi . in contrast, a significant increase in downy-mildew induced transcription is not observed for vvsts <dig> until  <dig> hpi and continues to increase up to  <dig> hpi. even so, the copy number of this group b gene transcript at  <dig> hpi is still significantly higher than that observed for the group a and c genes .

of greater significance is the observation that the application of both the uv-c and downy treatments led to a significant reduction in transcript accumulation of all three vvchs genes compared to control  discs . this is most clearly displayed in figure  <dig>  which show that as the combined level of vvsts transcription increased in response to these biotic and abiotic stress treatments, so the level of transcription of all three vvchs genes was suppressed by as much as 18– <dig> fold at 48 h post uv-c treatment  and 10– <dig> fold within 72 h of downy mildew inoculation .

discussion
expansion of the sts family in grapevine
to date, sts genes have been cloned from several plant species including peanut, sorghum, pine and grapevine  <cit> . in peanut and pine sts genes are organised in multigenic families composed of 2– <dig> members, although in the absence of a whole genome sequence for these species an accurate estimate of the number of family members is difficult. grapevine and sorghum represent the only two species which possess stilbene biosynthetic genes for which the genomes have been completely sequenced. screening of the sorghum genome sequence revealed the presence of a single, unique sts gene . in this study, a search for sts genes in the most update version of the genome assembly of the grape pn <dig> genotype referred to as 12x v <dig>  led to the identification of  <dig> members, designated vvsts <dig> to vvsts <dig> and included at least  <dig> full-length coding genes,  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> sequences that remain to be resolved .

the striking size of the grapevine sts gene family, compared to other stilbene-producing plant species, is not surprising given that analysis of the grape genome sequence has already indicated an expansion in the size of other gene families related to secondary metabolism in grapevine  <cit> . for example, it is estimated that there may be up to  <dig> terpene synthase  genes in grapevine based on the genome assembly of the pn entav  <dig> genotype  <cit> . the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  gene, which encodes for the key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, has  <dig> members in grapevine, whereas only 4– <dig> genes are present in arabidopsis, rice, and poplar  <cit> . more recently, falginella et al.  <cit>  reported on the expansion and subfunctionalization of the grapevine flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase  gene family, responsible for the biosynthesis of precursors of blue anthocyanins. large-scale  genome duplication has been recurring during angiosperm evolution and is one of the driving forces in the evolution of genomes and genetic systems  <cit> . subsequent gene loss and gene rearrangements further affect gene copy number and fractionate ancestral gene lineages across multiple chromosomes. the expansion of the f3’5’h family, which is composed of  <dig> members, appears to be the result of multiple events of segmental and tandem duplications that occurred in the vitaceae lineage, after the separation from other dicots  <cit> . of the  <dig> copies of f3'5'hs present in the pn <dig> genome,  <dig> reside in a tandem array within a  <dig> kb region on chr  <dig> with an isolated copy on chr  <dig>  although a detailed study of the vvsts evolution was not the major aim of this study, the model proposed for the f3’5’h family could also be applied to the vvsts gene family. the majority of vvsts members  are located in a  <dig> kb region on chr <dig>  which shows numerous paralogous zones, not only at the level of coding regions, but also in non-coding regions  suggesting multiple events of tandem and segmental duplication. something similar could have happened for members vvsts1vvsts <dig> located within an  <dig> kb region of chr  <dig>  a recent analysis of the genome architecture of the pn <dig> line and its high-identity duplication content by  <cit> , identified that 85 mb out of the 487 mb comprising the grapevine genome is duplicated. furthermore, they found that chr  <dig>  which contains the majority of vvsts family members, has the highest percentage  of segmental duplication among the assembled non-random chromosomes.

it is noteworthy that duplicate genes involved in secondary metabolism or involved in the response to exogenous stimuli, appear to be more frequently maintained than duplicate genes belonging to other categories  <cit> . moreover it’s generally assumed that the maintenance of duplicate genes provides a foundation for consolidation and refinement of established functions, particularly in secondary metabolism, by preserving extra copies that guarantee a gene reservoir for adaptive evolution  <cit> . what is particularly interesting in the case of the sts gene family is that the majority of plants don’t even possess a single sts gene, whilst grapevine has evolved such a large sts gene-reservoir. the fact that a single sts gene is present in the monocot sorghum  <cit>  suggests that the evolution of sts from chs, the common ancestor of pkss, occurred before the monocot-dicot separation. nevertheless, it’s difficult to explain the lack of stilbene-producing genes in the majority of plant species and the conservation and retention of many duplicated sts genes in a restricted group of unrelated species. it could be argued that the production of stilbenes did not confer an evolutionary advantage in those species that lost their biosynthetic genes or, on the other hand, that the majority of species were not able to cope with the production of compounds such as resveratrol, that, although related to benefits at low range of concentrations, are phytotoxic to plant cells at higher concentrations  <cit> .

structure/function of vvsts proteins
all full-length vvsts coding genes were found to encode proteins of  <dig> amino acids in length and contain the conserved chs/sts active site . in some cases , it was not possible, based on currently available sequence information, to determine with certainty whether the genes encode for a complete or truncated orf. this includes the genes vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig>  which are particularly interesting as they possess the conserved chs/sts active site within the truncated allele .

in a previous study, which compared the enzymological properties of three sts proteins  and one chs protein  from japanese red pine, it was observed that pdsts <dig>  which has a frame-shift mutation leading to a premature stop codon, presents a functional divergence compared to the other full-length sts/chs proteins  <cit> . in particular, the pdsts <dig> protein showed poor solubility compared to pdsts <dig>  but despite being truncated, still demonstrated a high potential for pinosylvin production. furthermore, neither pinosylvin nor pinocembrin inhibited the pdsts <dig> activity in vitro, whereas these metabolites effectively inhibited the activity of both pdsts <dig> and pdchsx. thus, although the truncated orfs of vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> are shorter than that observed for pdsts <dig>  we cannot rule out the possibility that these truncated alleles may still contribute to stilbene synthesis biosynthesis in grape cells.

together with the chss, stss represent the most studied enzymes of the plant type iii pks proteins and for this reason this group is often referred as the chs/sts type iii pks family. the two enzymes compete for the same substrates, share very close amino acid sequences, and possess very similar crystallographic structures  <cit> . previous phylogenetic analyses of the sts and chs families indicated that stss of scots pine, peanut and grapevine do not form a separate cluster, but instead cluster with the chss proteins from the same or related plants  <cit> . this observation, reinforced by the observation that only three amino acids exchanges were required within the n-terminal  <dig> aa of chs to shift the activity to a sts-type function, suggests that sts may have evolved from chs several times during the course of evolution  <cit> . in this study, the three chs genes identified in the pn <dig> genotype, based on clones previously isolated in cabernet sauvignon  <cit> , were included in the phylogenetic analysis performed on the sts family to investigate whether any of the predicted vvsts proteins cluster more closely to the vvchs clade. sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed the existence of  <dig> vvsts clades or groups, designated as a, b and c . group a is composed of genes located on chr <dig>  whereas groups b and c are composed of members located on chr <dig>  however, neighbour-joining analysis indicated that all predicted vvsts proteins cluster separately from the three vvchss, suggesting a conservation of function amongst all vvsts members. this observation is in agreement with a recent functional study in which  <dig> different vvsts genes  were transiently expressed in tobacco and all led to an accumulation of resveratrol and stilbenes, with no evidence for the production of any other products .

temporal and spatial patterns of sts gene expression in grapevine
using an expression atlas of v. vinifera cv. corvina , it was possible to investigate patterns of expression of all of the predicted coding members of the vvsts and vvchs gene families in different grapevine tissues and at different developmental stages .

expression of the majority of vvsts genes was found to be very low in most non-stressed grapevine tissues analysed. the two exceptions to this were in vitro roots and the berry rachis. the high level of vvsts expression in in vitro roots is in agreement with the detection of high levels of oligostilbenes in this organ  <cit> . moreover, the propagation of this organ in vitro is an artificial procedure that could represent a stress for the plant, leading to the stress-induced transcription of vvsts genes as observed in figure  <dig>  the elevated levels of vvstss expression in the berry rachis, however, are more surprising. what is particularly striking is the dramatic increase in transcription of group b and c vvsts genes in the rachis during maturation of the corvina berries while there is no detectable induction of vvsts genes in the berries themselves . as discussed in more detail below, vvsts expression in grape tissues such as leaves and berries appears to be strongly associated with senescence. thus, the results shown in figure  <dig> may reflect the fact that the rachis on corvina berries undergoes maturation and senescence during berry ripening. this is also supported by the fact that rachis are generally brown, dehydrated and lignified by the time berries reach full maturity.

interestingly, the microarray results did not show any significant increase in vvsts expression in corvina berries during both véraison and ripening. this is in contrast with previously reported studies, which indicate that healthy grape berries synthesise stilbene compounds under natural environmental conditions  <cit> . however, stilbene production during berry ripening has been shown to be genotype dependent with “high” producers such as pinot noir producing up to  <dig> ug resveratrol per g berry fresh wt at maturity  <cit>  compared to a low producer like corvina which was found to synthesize only  <dig>  μg g- <dig> at harvest  <cit> . it would appear, therefore, that the microarray technique was not sufficiently sensitive to detect the low level changes in vvsts expression during ripening of the corvina berries.

in general, vvsts expression was low in young grape leaves except for two vvsts gene members of group a. however, as observed for the rachis, grapevine leaves also show a dramatic increase in vvsts transcription as they reach maturity and begin to senesce . this was true of gene members of each vvsts group with individual genes increasing by as much as  <dig>  to  <dig> fold  in senescing leaves compared to young leaves. leaf senescence is an active and highly regulated process that involves an integrated response of leaf cells to age information and other internal and environmental signals  <cit> . it is accompanied by a decreased expression of genes related to photosynthesis and protein synthesis and an increase in the expression of hundreds of senescence-associated genes  <cit> . many of these genes are associated with the remobilization of nutrients to other developing organs  <cit> . however, it is not immediately clear as to what role stilbene biosynthesis would play in such a process. the observation that a number of pathogenesis-related  genes are induced during leaf senescence has lead to the suggestion that the senescence program might have incorporated features of the pathogen-defense response to protect the senescing leaf against opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . alternatively, the induction of sts genes in senescing leaves may simply be a consequence of changes in the levels of various phytohormones including abscissic acid , salicylic acid , jasmonates  and ethylene which are known to play an important role in regulating leaf senescence and which have also been shown to be involved in the induction of stilbene biosynthesis. for example, treatment of cabernet sauvignon cuttings with ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, resulted in an enhancement of both pal and sts gene induction leading to an increase in phytoalexins biosynthesis by  <cit> . similarly, ja, another key hormone in the senescence response, has been shown to induce high levels of sts transcription in cell cultures of v. vinifera cv. cabernet sauvignon  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the increased expression of sts genes during leaf senescence is related to an accumulation of hormones such as ethylene and jasmonates, which are well known to be involved in these particular plants developmental stages.

stress-induced vvsts gene expression in grapevine tissues
the majority of previous studies on the accumulation of stilbene compounds and their biosynthetic genes performed on peanut and grapevine tissues, indicated that these genes are highly inducible in response to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses including mechanical damage  <cit> , uv-c light irradiation  <cit> , treatments with chemicals such as aluminium ions, cyclodextrins and ozone  <cit>  and infection, including powdery mildew, downy mildew and gray mold  <cit> . although these studies have made important contributions to our general understanding of the behaviour of stilbene biosynthetic genes, in light of the information we now have regarding the size of the vvsts gene family and the strong sequence conservation amongst its members, the interpretation of some of this data needs to be reconsidered. to this end, we investigated the transcriptional response of all of the predicted coding members of the vvsts and vvchs gene families to three abiotic stress treatments  and one biotic treatment  using either grape berries or grape leaves.

the process of post-harvest berry drying  involves harvesting of ripe grapes and allowing them to dry over a period of three months in a naturally ventilated room. its primary purpose is to alter berry quality characteristics and increase the concentration of simple sugars in the production of dessert and fortified wines typical of the valpolicella region in italy. however, the drying of harvested grapes in this way results in a loss of over 30% of their weight through evaporation during this post-harvest treatment  <cit>  and, as such, imposes a significant water stress on the berries. it also results in a dramatic induction of the majority of vvsts genes  demonstrating that drying berries are still capable of undergoing a significant stress response. versari et al.  <cit>  previously observed an increase in the resveratrol content of skins sampled from corvina berries which had undergone an artificial berry withering treatment. a later study by zamboni et al.  <cit>  showed that berry withering was associated with an increase in the transcription of a range of genes involved in hexose metabolism and transport, cell wall composition, and secondary metabolism including a number of vvsts genes. our data extends these original observations to show that nearly all of the vvsts gene members are markedly induced by the dehydration stress. furthermore the increase in vvsts expression was detected predominately within skin of the drying grape berry . this is in agreement with the immuno-detection of sts proteins performed on berry extracts by fornara et al.  <cit>  who showed that sts protein is located mainly in berry exocarp during the véraison phase and is detected only occasionally within the mesocarp.

in order to obtain more control over the stress treatments imposed, the second set of experiments employed young rapidly expanding leaves harvested from glasshouse-grown v. vinifera cv. pinot noir plants and utilised whole transcriptome mrna-seq analysis to investigate the expression patterns of all of the predicted coding members of the vvsts and vvchs gene families in response to mechanical wounding, uv-c exposure and downy mildew  infection. in agreement with data obtained from the corvina expression atlas , there appears to be a much higher level of constitutive expression of the group a vvsts gene family members  than vvsts gene members belonging to groups b and c raising the question as to the role of group a vvsts proteins in young leaves. in terms of stress-induced expression, the results indicate that among the three stress treatments examined, uv-c exposure resulted in the highest vvsts induction, followed by downy mildew infection and wounding , confirming previous observations  <cit> . the much larger increase in vvsts induction in response to uv-c exposure may reflect the much larger number of cells within the leaf disc that are subjected to uv-c exposure compared to the wounding and downy mildew treatments which are only affecting a subset of cells. the data also indicates that members within the same vvsts groups are not only related through protein homology  but also appear to show similar transcriptional responses . thus, members of group b showed the highest response to all stress treatments, whereas group c members showed a reduced response, while the two group a genes showed little or no transcriptional response to the three stress treatments imposed.

in an attempt to validate the different stress-induced transcriptional responses within the vvsts gene family, a more detailed analysis of individual members of group a , group b  and group c  was undertaken using qpcr . the qpcr analysis confirmed the significant differences in the quantitative response of these different group members to the different abiotic and biotic stress treatments observed using the mrna-seq analysis . at the peak of induction, the transcript copy number of vvsts <dig> was found to be 15– <dig> fold higher than the levels of vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig>  if one assumes there are no major differences in translational efficiency between these different transcripts, this means that the bulk of the observed increase in the biosynthetic capacity of the stilbene pathway under stress conditions would appear to be contributed by the group b vvsts family members.

not only did qpcr analysis of stress-induced vvsts induction in grape leaves confirm the quantitative differences in the transcriptional response of the different group members, it also demonstrated clear differences in the pattern and timing of the response to the different abiotic and biotic stress treatments. the transcriptional response of vvsts <dig> and vvsts <dig> to both uv-c treatment and downy mildew infection appears to be similar and more rapid than the response of vvsts <dig>  leading one to speculate that the genes within the vvsts groups a and c may be responding to different transcriptional signals to those in group b. the differential timing in the stress-response of vvsts genes from the different groups provides an explanation for previous observations that total sts transcription in grape cells, as detected with northern blot assays or pcr using generic primers, following stress or elicitor treatment, is often observed to be biphasic  <cit> . indeed, wiese et al.  <cit>  previously suggested that the biphasic nature of the vvsts response indicated that the vvsts gene family may be divided into two groups: some expressed early with rapid degradation of the mrna and others which are expressed later, providing more stable mrna.

the different patterns of transcriptional response between the vvsts groups further suggest that these genes may be responding to different signalling pathways. both the ja and ethylene signalling pathways have previously been shown to have a role in sts transcription  <cit> . faurie et al.  <cit>  were able to show that co-treatment of cabernet sauvignon suspension cells with methyl-jasmonate  + ethephon  not only led to both a higher level of total stilbenes and vvsts transcription compared to treatment with either elicitor alone, but also resulted in a biphasic pattern of transcription which was not observed in cells treated with mej or ethephon only. these observations lend support to the hypothesis that vvsts genes within the different groups respond to different stress/defense signalling pathways.

transcriptional subfunctionalization has also been reported between the  <dig> members of the f3’5’h family  <cit> , where the development of structural variation in the promoter regions of recently duplicated gene copies has led to differences in member-specific patterns of accumulation across organs, developmental stages and cultivars. indeed, in the absence of transcriptional subfunctionalization, it would be hard to explain the retention of so many functionally identical vvsts gene family members.

one question yet to be resolved is the identity of the transcription factor which regulate vvsts transcription. the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes is regulated by the binding of r3r3-type myb transcription factors  to highly conserved cis-elements in their promoters  <cit> . over the last few years a number of r2r3-type myb tfs have been identified which regulate flavonol pathway genes in grapevine  <cit> , however, to date, no transcription factor responsible for the regulation of vvsts transcription has been reported. we have undertaken a ptm  analysis of the whole mrna-seq dataset for all  <dig>  genes annotated in the 12x v <dig> pn <dig> assembly to identify tf genes that show co-expression with vvsts under the different stress conditions applied. this has resulted in the identification of two r3r3-myb candidates which we believe have a role in the transcriptional regulation of the stilbene biosynthetic pathway .

differential regulation of vvsts and vvchs genes in grapevine during development and in response to stress
although there appears to have been little divergence in sequence since the evolution of sts from chs, there has been sufficient mutation to lead to changes in the products synthesised. these products clearly fulfill very different roles in plant growth and development. chalcone synthase catalyses the first committed step of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which leads to the synthesis of anthocyanins, tannins and flavonols. stilbene synthase, on the other hand, appears to function primarily as a stress-response protein, and has been implicated to have a role in defence against pathogens including powdery mildew, downy mildew and botrytis cinerea <cit> . as these two proteins represent branch points in the same pathway, the diversion of carbon skeletons into either secondary metabolism via chs or stilbenic defence compounds via sts would be expected to be under tight control.

evidence for the existence of crosstalk between these two pathways in grapevine cells is clearly evident from the analysis of gene expression data in corvina tissues at various developmental stages . tissues in which vvsts expression levels are generally low i.e. stem, bud, young leaves, rachis at fruit set and developing berries are characterised by high constitutive expression of at least one of the three different vvchs genes . conversely, expression of all three vvchs genes is suppressed in tissues in which vvsts transcription is strongly induced i.e. roots, senescing leaves, maturing rachi and berries undergoing withering treatment. a similar pattern of inverse expression patterns between the members of the vvsts and vvchs gene families is also evident in grape leaves exposed to uv-c or inoculated with downy mildew . while both stress treatments resulted in dramatic increase in vvsts transcription, the expression of all three vvchs genes was strongly suppressed relative to the untreated leaf discs.

while a number of previous studies have shown that the expression of chs can be induced by uv-a and uv-b light and pathogen infection , this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effect of uv-c light on chs transcription. the other major difference between our study and previous investigations is that our research has been carried out on grapevine which has a highly evolved stilbene biosynthetic pathway which is strongly induced by both uv-c and downy mildew infection. as such, one might expect there to be an enhanced level of cross-talk between the flavonoid and stilbene biosynthetic pathways in grapevine.

it has been well documented that the triggering of defence pathways in plants causes a suppression of genes associated with photosynthesis and basic metabolism leading to the suggestion that there is a diversion of metabolic resources from general metabolism to defense-related metabolism, during pathogen attack. this is particularly true for the flavonoid pathway, which has been shown to be suppressed in a number of different plant species following exposure to fungal pathogens or fungal elicitors  <cit> . recently schenke et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the induction of biosynthetic pathways, in arabidopsis, responsible for the synthesis of lignin and the phytoalexin scopoletin, by the bacterial elicitor flg <dig>  was associated with a strong suppression of flavonol biosynthesis genes including chs. they concluded that as flavonols, lignin and scopoletin are all derived from phenylalanine, that under stress conditions, the plant appears to refocuses it’s metabolism on the production of scopoletin and lignin, at the expense of flavonol. we propose that a similar antagonistic relationship exists between flavonol biosynthesis and stilbene biosynthesis in grapevine and that during periods of abiotic or biotic stress, stilbene biosynthesis takes precedence over flavonol biosynthesis.

how might this antagonistic relationship be regulated? in arabidopsis, it appears that the antagonistic relationship between the flavonol and stress/defense biosynthetic pathways involves the action of at least two opposing myb tfs: myb <dig>  and myb <dig> , which compete for binding to myb-recognition elements within the promoters of the flavonol biosynthetic pathway genes. we are currently investigating whether r2r3-myb candidates in grapevine might also repress the transcription of the vvchs genes during the induction of the stilbene biosynthesis pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequencing of the grapevine genome, together with the vertiginous development of next generation sequencing technologies constitute a powerful tool for gene search and studies concerning their evolution, expression and function. this study embodies a particularly significant example of the advantages provided by these new tools, providing a detailed description of the expression patterns of each vvsts genes in an extremely conserved gene family such as the one here described. this is the first study to our knowledge that describes the behaviour of the vvsts gene family focusing on each single member and taking into account the strong sequence conservation that characterizes it. using this approach we have demonstrated transcriptional subfunctionalization amongst different members of the vvsts gene family. furthermore we provide evidence for the co-ordinated transcriptional regulation of the vvsts and vvchs gene families which may serve to regulate the flow of carbon via these two competing metabolic pathways.
