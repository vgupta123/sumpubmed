BACKGROUND
rotaviruses are members of the family reoviridae. rotaviruses affecting pigs are classified as group a, b or c based on their respective inner capsid protein sequences <cit> . the rotavirus double-stranded rna genome is composed of  <dig> segments enclosed by a nonenveloped, triple-layered icosahedral capsid  <cit> . the outer capsid vp <dig> protein can induce neutralizing antibodies resulting in protecting herd from porcine rotavirus infection.

porcine rotaviruses are the major cause of acute diarrhea in the piglets  <cit>  and can cause mild-severe diarrhea associated with potentially high morbidity and mortality. group a rotaviruses cause diarrhea in pigs both before and after weaning  <cit>  and can account for  <dig> and 44% pre- and post-weaning rotavirus-associated diarrhea in swine, respectively  <cit> . a recent report attributed 89% of all rotavirus-associated diarrhea in commercial pig farms to group a rotavirus infections  <cit> . since rotaviruses can survive in the environment for long period of time and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route outbreaks are difficult to control. virion replication occurs at the tips of epithelial cell in intestinal villi and destroy enterocytes primarily in the jejunum and ileum resulting in villous atrophy  <cit> . furthermore, nutrients cannot be digested or absorbed in the affected regions resulting in severe malabsorption  <cit> . a better understanding of rotavirus epidemiology will contribute to the optimization of current vaccines and prevention programs for the control of rotavirus infection. currently available vaccines  can not offer efficient immunity. to stimulate efficient immunity, a large vaccine dose and repeated administration are usually required. this often results in undesirable clinical signs. to overcome these shortcomings, the potential development of lactic acid bacteria  to deliver heterologous antigen to the mucosal immune system has been proposed.

since rotaviruses are enteric pathogens, mucosal immunity is likely to play an important role in protective immunity. innate immune responses in gut provide the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms and also initiate acquired immune responses. furthermore, immune responses resulting from oral immunization are the only suitable method of stimulating gut immunity  <cit>  since this route facilitates stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue  enhancing the production of anti-viral iga  <cit> .

compared to recombinant antigens or heat-killed formulations, 'live' vaccines elicit the most effective protective responses since they stimulate both systemic and mucosal immunity  <cit> . however, oralvaccination presents a challenge since the gut milieu often denatures and/or inactivates potential vaccinogens therefore large vaccination doses and repeated vaccinations are required <cit> . this often results in fecal shedding of the live vaccine in addition to causing fever and diarrhea  <cit> . these challenges can be overcome by using lactic acid bacteria  as antigen delivery system for the stimulation of mucosal immunity  <cit>  owing to its safety. lab are used in industrial food fermentation, preservation and have beneficial effects on the health of both humans and animals and 'generally regarded as safe, . in addition, many strains of lab are able to survive and colonize the intestinal tract  <cit>  inducing a non-specific immunoadjuvant effect  <cit>  which prompted studies aimed at determining the oral vaccine potential of lab-derived vaccines.

since genetically engineered vaccines composed of a single recombinant antigen are poorly immunogenic, it is important to increase their immunogenicity by combining with appropriate adjuvants. the e. coli heat-labile toxin b subunit  has been shown to be a potent mucosal adjuvant  <cit>  with low potential of eliciting allergic responses  <cit> .

in this study, we tested the efficacy of the l. casei atcc  <dig> expressing the heterologous vp <dig> porcine rotavirus protein and its ability acting as an antigen delivery system for oral vaccinations. we constructed recombinant strains expressing porcine rotavirus vp <dig> and vp4-ltb. the immunogenic potential of the two recombinant strains was analyzed after oral administration of live bacteria to mice. this is the first report describing the cloning and expression of porcine rotavirus genes in lactobacillus. the data reported indicate that oral administration of two recombinant strains ppg <dig> -vp <dig> or ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb could induce specific anti-rotavirus mucosal and systemic immune responses. the potency of the immune responses measured was greater in animals immunized with l. casei-expressing the vp4-ltb fusion  demonstrating the efficacy of ltb as a mucosal adjuvant.

RESULTS
expression of vp <dig> and vp4-ltb in l. casei
the sequences of the respective l. casei  <dig> transformants are confirmed by plasmid dna sequencing and the result shows that there is no mutation in the transformants .

rlc393:ppg <dig> -vp <dig> and ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb were grown in basal mrs medium supplemented with either xylose or glucose. cell lysates subjected to sds-page and showed the corresponding vp <dig> and vp4-ltb recombinant proteins at  <dig> and  <dig> kda respectively after analyzing by coomassie blue staining, following xylose induction . proteins were not expressed if cells were grown in basal mrs medium supplemented with glucose . gels run in parallel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and examined by western blot analysis using anti-vp <dig> antibodies. immunoreactive bands corresponding to vp <dig> and vp4-ltb were observed at  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively . reactive bands were not detected if the cells were instead grown in the presence of glucose . these results demonstrated the efficiency and specificity of the l. casei xylose promoter.

immunofluorescence analysis
l. casei surface-displayed expression of vp <dig> and vp4-ltb, respectively, was confirmed by immunofluorescence. overnight cultures of ppg <dig> -vp <dig> and ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb were grown in basal mrs medium supplemented with either xylose or glucose. the cells were washed, incubated with mouse anti-vp <dig> anti serum followed by a fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg. vp <dig> was detected on the surface of ppg <dig> -vp <dig> and ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb cells grown in the presence of xylose . no immunofluorescence was observed when wild-type l. casei  <dig> was incubated in a similar fashion .

antibody responses following oral immunizations
the ability of the respective vp4-expressing l. casei vectors to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity was assessed by determining the presence of anti-vp <dig> igg and iga antibodies, respectively. anti-vp <dig> igg antibody levels in serum of mice treated with either ppg <dig> -vp <dig> or ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb were similar to each other but higher than only with ppg <dig>  . after the first booster, a prompter and stronger level of anti-vp4-specific serum igg was elicited in mice that were administered with recombinant strains. a statistically significant difference was observed on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . no significant elicitation of anti-vp <dig> antibodies was observed in the control groups that received ppg <dig> .

as the results showed, there were no substantial differences in mucosal iga levels between experimental and control groups prior to oral immunization. following administration with the l. casei recombinants, specific anti-vp <dig> mucosal iga responses were observed. after the second boost, significant levels of anti-vp <dig> iga were observed from mucosal secretions following administration of either ppg <dig> -vp <dig> or ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb compared to responses observed in control mice. statistically significant difference  was observed in ophthalmic and vaginal wash of mice administered with recombinant strains after seven days and fecal pellets after one day. the mucosal iga levels elicited by ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb were higher than ppg <dig> -vp <dig> immunization and the difference is significant statistically . this indicated that ltb enhanced the mucosal immune system response.

neutralization ability of the induced antibodies analysis
the neutralization ability of the induced antibodies was investigated to further detect whether the antibody responses were against rv. results demonstrated that the presence of anti-rprv-vp <dig> igg in the culture medium conferred statistically significant neutralizing effects  on rv infection. a near  <dig> % ±  <dig> % reduction of cpe was consistently observed when the assays were carried out using 2-to 16-fold diluted sera from mice immunized with ppg <dig> -vp <dig>  and a  <dig> % ±  <dig> % reduction of cpe was observed by using 2-to 16-fold diluted sera from mice immunized with ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb. the inhibitory effect decreased gradually on further dilutions of sera and reached to the level similar to that of the control, which of sera administered with ppg <dig> -vp <dig> is 1: <dig> and ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb is 1: <dig> in figure.  <dig>  the neutralizing efficacy of anti-vp <dig> igg from mice immunized with ppg <dig> -vp <dig> was lower than ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb and the difference was significant statistically .

discussion
porcine rotaviruses are the major cause of acute diarrhea in the piglets and can cause mild to severe diarrhea with potentially high morbidity and mortality rates. infection with porcine rotavirus has been an economic concern to worldwide pig breeders. vaccination is the main prophylatic method for the prevention of porcine rotavirus infections. mucosal immunization offer a number of advantages over other routes of antigen delivery, including ease of administration, cost effectiveness and the capacity of inducing both local and systemic immune responses  <cit> .

to assess mucosal immune responses, specific iga anti-vp <dig> protein levels were examined from various mucosal surfaces. oral administration of recombinant vp <dig> or vp4-ltb-expressing l. casei induced both systemic  and mucosal  immune responses. specifically, iga specific for vp <dig> could be isolated from the gastrointestinal tract, vagina and eye secretions compared to no detectable iga anti-vp <dig> responses in control animals. these experiments suggested that l. casei expressing recombinant vp <dig> could be used in the vaccination of pigs, potentially protecting them from porcine rotavirus infections since this vector successfully elicited a significant and specific anti-vp <dig> iga response.

the titers of anti-vp <dig> igg in the serum from mice immunized with the l. casei ppg <dig> -vp <dig> or ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb were similar but higher than the control group. rlc393:ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb induced even higher iga specific for vp <dig> compared to mice immunized with the ppg <dig> -vp <dig> as a result of the ltb mucosal adjuvant. it demonstrated the specific mucosal adjuvanticity of ltb, highlighting its potential use as a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant that can be used in conjunction with vp <dig> for the elicitation of specific anti-porcine rotavirus immunity.

furthermore, in order to confirm the efficacy of the induced antibodies in inhibiting the virus, we tested whether sera collected from immunized mice could inhibit the infection of rv in ma <dig> cells by neutralization ability assay. the results showed that serum collected from mice immunized with recombinant strains demonstrated statistically significant inhibition. the neutralization by sera antibodies obtained from mice immunized with ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb was more effective than that of mice immuned with the ppg <dig> -vp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we described the methods for constructing two l. casei recombinant expression vectors expressing the porcine rotavirus vp <dig> antigen or vp4-ltb fusion protein. l. casei is an excellent delivery vector since it can withstand the rigors of the intestinal environment in addition to being able to colonize different mucosal sites  and guaranteeing proper  presentation of the respective antigens to the immune system. in addition to the versatility of l. casei, it possesses probiotic properties making it an even more attractive vaccine delivery system i.e., immunization with l. casei expressing vp4-ltb elicited potent anti-vp <dig> iga responses. testing the efficacy in a porcine vaccination and infection model is a next step in testing the efficacy of this vaccine formulation.
