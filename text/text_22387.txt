BACKGROUND
since its discovery two decades ago  <cit> , the marine cyanobacterial genus prochlorococcus has rapidly become established as a model organism in microbial ecology  <cit> . as for other cyanobacteria with an obligate photoautotrophic lifestyle, prochlorococcus has an absolute dependency on solar energy for cell maintenance and multiplication  <cit> . in the field, the rhythmic nature of light availability imposes a synchronization of its whole metabolism. indeed, light/dark  entrained prochlorococcus cells were shown to display a strong diurnal periodicity of many cellular functions, including cell cycle  <cit> , pigment synthesis  <cit> , carbon fixation  <cit> , and amino acid uptake  <cit> . synchronization primarily acts on gene expression, as evidenced first by studies focusing on individual cell cycle  and photosynthesis related genes   <cit> , then more recently at the whole transcriptome level  <cit> . under optimal growth conditions, generation times of prochlorococcus populations are generally around  <dig> h, though faster growth rates have sometimes been reported  <cit> . the dna replication period is usually restricted to the late afternoon and dusk period and cytokinesis occurs during the night  <cit> .

studying the interplay between energy source fluctuations  and cell cycle dynamics of prochlorococcus is of special interest as it lays the foundation for designing reliable population growth models for this key organism, considered to be the most abundant free-living photosynthetic organism on earth  <cit> . as early as  <dig>  vaulot and coworkers  <cit>  noticed that in field populations of prochlorococcus, the timing of dna replication varied with depth, with the initiation of dna synthesis occurring about  <dig> h earlier below the thermocline than in the upper mixed layer. at that time, these authors interpreted this delay as a possible protective mechanism to prevent exposure of replicating dna to the high midday irradiances and especially uv. since then, a number of studies have shown that prochlorococcus populations are in fact composed of several genetically distinct ecotypes adapted to different light niches in the water column  <cit> . the upper mixed layer is dominated by the so-called high light adapted  ecotypes , whereas low light adapted  ecotypes  are restricted to the bottom of the euphotic zone  <cit> . these studies also showed that a third ecotype , initially classified as a ll clade , preferentially lived at intermediate depth, reaching maximal concentrations in the vicinity of the thermocline. comparative genomics revealed that these various ecotypes display a number of genomic differences, including distinct sets of genes involved in dna repair pathways  <cit> . for instance, genes encoding dna photolyases, which are involved in the repair of thymidine dimers, are found in hl and enatl ecotypes, but not in "true" ll strains . besides this light niche specialization, a dramatic genome reduction has affected all prochlorococcus lineages except the lliv clade, situated at the base of the prochlorococcus radiation. this streamlining process seemingly reduced their signal transduction and gene expression regulatory capacity, raising the question how prochlorococcus cells sense environmental signals and translate them into cellular responses  <cit> . thus, hl ecotypes possess only five sensor histidine kinases and seven response regulators, the two protein types that make up two-component regulatory systems in cyanobacteria  <cit> . as this set is considerably smaller than that found in most other prokaryotes, additional regulatory mechanisms are likely to exist. recent experimental evidence indeed suggested the involvement of sophisticated post-translational regulatory mechanisms and a key role of non-coding rnas  in acclimation processes of prochlorococcus marinus med <dig> cells to a variety of environmental stresses  <cit> .

the discovery of ecotypes with different light response characteristics, each with a specific depth distribution in the field calls into question the abovementioned interpretation of the delay in dna synthesis initiation noticed in field populations by vaulot and coworkers  <cit> . comparative cell cycle dynamics of the p. marinus hli strain med <dig> and the llii strain ss <dig> under similar light/dark conditions indeed showed that ss <dig> initiated dna replication 1- <dig> h earlier than med <dig>  <cit> . so, ecotypic differences may also explain this delay. in the present paper, we reexamine this issue by directly characterizing the effects of uv radiation on the cell cycle dynamics and gene expression patterns of l/d synchronized cultures of the hli strain pcc <dig> 

RESULTS
comparative cell cycle dynamics of acclimated p. marinus pcc <dig> cells grown in batch cultures with and without uv radiation
a first series of preliminary experiments using batch cultures of p. marinus pcc <dig> was performed in order to examine the effects of uv exposure on cell cycle and growth. cells were acclimated for several weeks to a modulated  <dig> h/ <dig> h l/d cycle of photosynthetically available radiation  reaching about  <dig> Î¼mol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> at virtual noon , or with modulated uv radiation added , the uv dose at noon reaching  <dig>  w m- <dig> for uv-a and  <dig>  w m- <dig> for uv-b . samples were then taken every hour during three consecutive days and the dna content of cells was measured by flow cytometry . in both light conditions, prochlorococcus population growth conformed to the slow-growth case of cooper and helmstetter's prokaryotic cell cycle model  <cit> , with only one dna replication round per day. indeed, as described before  <cit> , prochlorococcus dna distributions always resembled the characteristic bimodal dna distributions observed for eukaryotes, with a first discrete gap phase , where cells possess one chromosome copy, preceding a well defined chromosome replication phase , followed by a second gap phase , where cells have completed dna replication but have not yet divided, and thus possess two chromosome copies . the g1/s/g <dig> designation will therefore be used in the text hereafter.

the faster progression of cells through s and g <dig> phases under hl+uv than hl only conditions in batch culture was confirmed by calculating the lengths of the s and g <dig> phases, which were shorter in the former condition . cells grown under hl+uv exhibited a higher level of synchronization  than those grown under hl only. however, the calculated growth rates were not significantly different between the two conditions. therefore, the dose of uv irradiation that was used in this experiment did not prevent cells from growing at near maximal rate despite the delay of entry in s phase . it must be noted that growth rates calculated from the percentages of cells in s and g <dig>  using the method described by carpenter & chang  <cit>  were systematically about 10% higher than those calculated from the change in cell number . since the latter method was used to assess the growth rate of continuous cultures , these experiments in batch cultures were therefore useful to estimate the bias brought by these cell cycle-based growth rate measurements.

cell cycle dynamics of p. marinus pcc <dig> cells in batch culture during shifts to a different light condition
a second series of preliminary experiments in batch culture was performed to see i) whether changes in par level from modulated low light  to modulated hl  would also affect the timing of the initiation of dna replication in p. marinus cells and ii) how fast was the delay in chromosome replication observed when pcc <dig> cells pre-acclimated to hl were suddenly exposed to hl+uv conditions.

when acclimated to modulated ll, p. marinus cells generally started chromosome replication slightly earlier  than under hl conditions and the s phase maximum was also reached  <dig> h earlier . when shifted to hl, cells initiated dna replication at the same time as in ll, but the peak of s cells was shifted to the ldt, as observed for hl acclimated cells. this event was accompanied by a notable increase in the peak height of the s cell maximum  on the first day of increased par, but on the second day after hl shift, this percentage decreased to levels  comparable to those observed in hl acclimated cultures . indeed, pcc <dig> cells grew much faster under hl than ll conditions and the maximal growth rate  was reached already on the first day of increased par . this enhanced growth rate resulted from a dramatic shortening of the g <dig> phase and, to a less extent, of the g <dig> phase, whereas the s phase was extended . however, this rather long s phase, as compared to hl acclimated cells, suggests that cultures were not physiologically fully acclimated to the new light conditions, even two days after the shift.

in the second shift experiment, hl acclimated pcc <dig> cultures were sampled during one complete l/d cycle, then on the following two days were subjected to a modulated l/d cycle of hl+uv radiations. as for the hl+uv acclimated cells, uv exposure seemed to cause a delay in the initiation of dna replication, but with the peak of s cells occurring  <dig> to  <dig> h after the ldt , instead of  <dig> h. furthermore, although the uv dose received by the cells was the same in the uv acclimation and uv shift experiments, uv irradiation was clearly much more stressful for the cells in the second case, as they reacted by dramatically decreasing their growth rate , an effect which was even more marked on the second day after switching the uv lamps on.

comparative cell cycle dynamics of acclimated p. marinus pcc <dig> cells grown in continuous cultures with and without uv radiation
large volume, continuous cultures of p. marinus cells acclimated to either hl or hl+uv conditions were used for gene expression analyses. these cultures were sampled for rna eight times per day during three consecutive days. a shorter sampling interval  was used during the dna replication period , to closely analyze transcriptome changes caused by uv radiation during this critical phase of the cell cycle. the pattern of g <dig>  s and g <dig> phases in hl+uv was similar to that in the batch experiments, with the same  <dig> h delay of the s phase into the dark period . however, in hl conditions, the g <dig> maximum in continuous culture occurred on average  <dig> h earlier than in batch cultures due to a shorter g <dig> period and a better synchronization index of the whole population . this is possibly linked to the particularly fast growth rate  observed in this experiment . another notable difference between the two sets of experiments is the fact that during the second and third day in the continuous hl+uv culture, there was a shoulder on the left of the s peak , suggesting that a small percentage of cells already had entered into s phase  <dig> h before the ldt, though the bulk of the cell population replicated dna only during the dark period. the comparison of Î¼cc between batch and continuous cultures clearly demonstrated that the latter were growing exponentially in both hl and hl+uv conditions during the whole sampling period used for gene expression analyses.

effects of ultraviolet radiation on the whole transcriptome dynamics
microarray analyses were used to identify which genes were differentially expressed between hl and hl+uv during the active phases of the cell cycle of p. marinus pcc <dig>  with the goal to understand the molecular bases of the delay of dna replication in the latter condition. we made pairwise comparisons of microarray datasets corresponding to the same time points around the ldt in hl+uv and hl conditions, i.e. 15: <dig> , 18: <dig> , 20: <dig>  and 22: <dig> . to better analyze the changes in gene expression patterns occurring during the dna synthesis  phase, we also compared samples taken at 20: <dig> in hl+uv and at 18: <dig> in hl , respectively, as this corresponds to the maximum percentage of cells in s for each condition .

overall,  <dig> genes of the  <dig>  analyzed genes  showed statistically significant differential expression levels in all comparisons performed between the two light conditions, with a false discovery rate  â¤  <dig>  using t-test and/or limma analyses  values, i.e. with log <dig> > 1; see fig.  <dig> and additional file 3: table t1). the greatest number of differentially expressed genes was obtained for the uv <dig> vs. hl <dig>  > 1; fig. 4) and the uv <dig> vs. hl <dig> comparisons  > 1; fig. 4).

hierarchical clustering analysis using pearson's correlation of the whole expression dataset  showed that for any given light treatment and time of the day, cultures a and b grouped well together . this showed that experimental conditions influenced the expression data more than did technical and biological variability between replicates. furthermore, whole transcriptomic profiles clustered according to the sampling time and/or cell cycle stage, since uv <dig> and hl <dig> corresponded to g <dig>  uv <dig> and hl <dig> to s, and uv <dig> and hl <dig> to g <dig>  it is noteworthy that the two replicates of uv <dig> were not congruent, since sample b clustered close to hl <dig> and uv <dig>  as expected for cells that are seemingly arrested in g <dig>  whereas sample a clustered with the hl <dig> dataset, i.e. according to sampling time. finally, the hl <dig> dataset clustered with the uv <dig> and hl <dig> datasets, consistent with the fact that part of the population of the hl <dig> sample was already in g <dig> . thus, it seems that the s phase delay had a strong effect on the pcc <dig> transcriptome, competing with the strong effect of diurnal rhythm, since most genes are light-regulated in these organisms  <cit> .

among the statistically significant genes mentioned above, only  <dig> genes  displayed fold changes higher than two-fold in hl vs. hl+uv timepoint pairwise comparisons . the following paragraphs discuss the most meaningful comparisons.

eleven genes from this dataset were differentially expressed in uv <dig> vs. hl <dig>  and may be involved in the cell response to uv exposure. seven of them were upregulated under hl+uv . these were one non-coding rna , five photosynthetic genes, including pmm <dig>  one member of the high light inducible  gene family , and pmm <dig>  an ortholog of slr <dig>  which encodes ftsh, a protein involved in d <dig> repair and degradation in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> . consistently with quantitative pcr analyses , the pmm <dig> gene encoding the type ii Ï factor rpod <dig> was downregulated at 15: <dig> in cultures exposed to hl+uv, though its p-value was statistically significant only before benjamini and hochberg  adjustment .

the uv <dig> vs. hl <dig> comparison showed the largest number  of differentially expressed genes, as expected from the fact that cells were essentially in g <dig> in the hl+uv condition, whereas in hl most cells were in s . one third of these genes  had no assigned function. the gene coding for one of the main subunits of the atp synthase  was downregulated under hl+uv and most genes coding for other subunits of this complex  were also very close to the statistically significant fold change  cutoff . if these relative reductions in the transcript levels of atp genes at 18: <dig> in the cells grown in hl+uv actually translated into a lower amount of atpase produced, this could have resulted into a relative decrease  in energy supply of these cells during the dark period. two key genes for the synthesis of rna polymerase, i.e. rpoa , encoding the Î± subunit, and pmm <dig>  encoding the major Ï factor rpod1/siga, were also expressed at much lower levels under hl+uv than hl conditions at 18: <dig>  assuming that this reduction resulted in correspondly lower protein levels, it is possible that the overall transcriptional activity of uv-acclimated cells could be reduced after the ldt. since pmm <dig>  encoding the type ii Ï factor rpod <dig>  was upregulated under hl+uv, it is possible that rpod <dig> replaces rpod <dig> in the early dark period. the transcriptional regulator gene pedr  and two genes potentially involved in dna repair  were also upregulated at 18: <dig> in the hl+uv condition , suggesting that the latter genes were directly or indirectly involved in the repair of dna damage caused by uv irradiation.

surprisingly, the uv <dig> vs. hl <dig> comparison also revealed a high number of up- or downregulated genes , suggesting that although cells were predominantly in s phase in both light conditions, uv irradiation during the day altered differentially the pattern of expression of genes from the different metabolic pathways around the ldt. among annotated genes of this dataset, those most represented belonged to the functional categories of ribosomal proteins . however, most of these genes were also upregulated in the hl <dig> vs. hl <dig> comparison , indicating that the diel expression pattern of these key translation genes was less affected by uv stress than by daytime, at least around the ldt period. most of the genes that were differentially regulated in the uv <dig> vs. hl <dig> but not in the hl <dig> vs. hl <dig> comparisons belonged to the conserved hypothetical gene category .

few genes were differentially expressed between hl and hl+uv during the dark period  and most of them were not assignable to a characterized functional category . this suggests that the effect of uv irradiation on the pcc <dig> transcriptome was no longer significant only a few hours after the ldt.

altogether, surprisingly few genes belonging to pathways directly linked to the cell cycle crossed the statistical significance  and fc  cutoffs . to insure that this was not due to a lack of sensitivity of the arrays and to gain more detailed information on the behavior of this gene category, seventeen genes were selected and subsequently analyzed by real time quantitative pcr . this set includes genes that were either differentially expressed in microarray analyses or representative of key processes, including dna replication, cell division, dna repair, transcriptional regulation and the circadian clock. all genes that exhibited significantly different expression levels  in one of our comparisons in microarray analyses showed a similar response  in qpcr experiments .

expression patterns of genes involved in the initiation of chromosome replication and cell division are strongly affected by uv radiation
three genes were selected as representatives of the dna replication and cell division pathways, dnaa , encoding the dna replication initiation protein dnaa, ftsz , encoding the tubulin homolog gtpase protein ftsz, which forms a ring-shaped septum at midcell during cell division, and sepf , encoding a protein involved in the assembly and stability of the ftsz ring  <cit> . the transcript levels of all three genes exhibited strong temporal variations during the diel cycle in both light conditions . under hl+uv conditions, although expression levels of both dnaa and ftsz genes significantly increased at 15: <dig> compared to the 6: <dig> time point, the expression level was 3- to 5-fold lower than under hl at 15: <dig>  the sepf gene expression pattern was characterized by a strong peak at the ldt in hl, but like for the other two genes, the diel variations of sepf expression levels were dramatically reduced in uv-irradiated cells. in both light conditions, the sepf expression was maximum during the s phase .

transcript levels of dna repair genes are moderately affected by uv radiation
analyses of diel expression patterns of six genes representative of different dna repair pathways were compared between hl and hl+uv conditions . these patterns were very different among the six genes, suggesting a refined orchestration of the different pathways. a first set of dna repair genes, including phra , which codes for a dna photolyase and uvra , encoding the subunit a of the excinuclease uvrabc, an enzyme of the nucleotide excision dna repair  pathway, was strongly expressed during the light period. their expression levels followed more or less closely the diel cycle of irradiance . interestingly, the relative expression levels of both genes were already high under hl and exposure to uv radiations did not provoke any further increase of these levels, even at midday. the only notable difference between the hl and hl+uv profiles was a slightly higher expression level at 9: <dig> am for both genes in the former condition .

expression levels of muts , a gene involved in the dna mismatch repair  pathway, rose throughout the light period at the same rate in both light conditions, peaked right before the peak of s cells , then decreased during the dark period . in sharp contrast with other dna repair genes, the ruvc gene , which encodes the subunit c of the ruvabc resolvase endonuclease, an enzyme involved in recombinational dna repair processes by homologous recombination, was downregulated during the daytime and was only induced at the ldt . it showed no response to the addition of uv radiation.

among all dna repair genes, the diel expression pattern of reca , which encodes an atpase involved in repair of dna double-strand breaks  by homologous recombination, was seemingly the most affected by the presence of uv radiation. this pattern closely resembled that of sepf, with expression maxima concomitant with the s peak in both light conditions . however, in contrast to sepf, the height of the expression peak  was similar between hl and hl+uv conditions . the temporal expression pattern of umuc , encoding a subunit of the error-prone polymerase v , was also somewhat affected by uv exposure, since in hl+uv, the gene remained highly expressed for  <dig> h after the midday maximum, whereas in hl only, umuc gene expression decreased sharply after the noon expression peak . this suggests that cells which were exposed to uv irradiation before entering s phase might use the dna translesion synthesis  pathway  <cit>  in order to overcome uv-induced lesions potentially blocking dna replication.

global transcription regulators and circadian clock genes are mildly affected by uv stress
rna polymerase sigma factors are transcriptional regulators involved in the response of cyanobacteria to a variety of stress conditions  <cit> . the prochlorococcus marinus pcc <dig> genome encodes five sigma factors  <cit> , which have been named here mainly following the nomenclature used for synechococcus sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  . this includes one member of the principal group  <dig> sigma factor , and four members of the group  <dig> sigma factors , of which rpod7- <dig> are specific for marine picocyanobacteria  <cit> . in the present study, we used a qpcr approach to examine the expression of rpod <dig> and rpod <dig>  which were previously shown to have very distinct diel patterns under modulated diel cycles of par  <cit> . the rpod <dig> gene was upregulated earlier in hl than hl+uv conditions, with equivalent expression at noon under both growth conditions, then downregulated during the rest of the day with a greater decrease throughout the subjective night period under hl+uv growth conditions . this pattern was completely the opposite of rpod <dig>  which was expressed at a low level until noon in hl , was strongly upregulated at the ldt, then returned to the same expression level as at 6: <dig>  for the rest of the dark period .

the lexa gene  encodes a transcriptional regulator, which in escherichia coli governs the sos dna damage repair response  <cit> . like rpod <dig>  the lexa rna level was the lowest during the morning hours, then strongly increased after midday so that expression was maximal at the ldt and decreased slowly thereafter . the pattern was similar in both light conditions, except that the peak in hl+uv was slightly lower.

two genes linked to the circadian clock machinery were also studied, kaib , encoding one of the only two core clock proteins  and sasa , coding for a two-component sensory transduction histidine kinase which relays clock output signal to downstream genes  <cit> . in hl, the level of kaib mrna decreased during the first hours of the light period, reaching a minimum at noon and then increasing until 20: <dig>  when it reached an expression level similar to the 6: <dig> reference level . in hl+uv, kaib expression pattern was generally the same as in hl, except that its relative expression level was two-fold lower at noon, then increased progressively to reach the reference expression level at approximately 2: <dig>  as already noted in a previous study  <cit> , diel changes in kaic gene  expression levels were very low, with no significant differences under hl and hl+uv growth conditions .

a diel cycle in the transcript levels of the sasa gene was also observed. in hl, it roughly followed that of kaib except that there was no mimima at noon, but rather a long period of downregulation lasting from 9: <dig> to 18: <dig>  then a slight upregulation at the beginning of the night . in the presence of uv, the relative sasa expression levels were lower than in hl during most of the day, consistent with the effect of uv irradiation on kaib rna levels. the most notable difference between the two light conditions is  that the switch from down- to upregulation of sasa was delayed in hl+uv and concomitant with the s peak , suggesting a possible involvement of circadian clock output signals on timing of cell cycle progression in pcc <dig> 

discussion
importance of the modulated character of uv radiation and of light history on the response of prochlorococcus cells to uv stress
several field studies using on-deck incubations have suggested that the marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus is particularly susceptible to the direct  effects of uv irradiation, in particular in comparison to the co-occurring and phylogenetically closely related genus synechococcus, which is seemingly much more resistant to uv stress  <cit> . this apparent sensitivity has been attributed in part to the tiny size of prochlorococcus cells as well as their streamlined genomes, encompassing a minimal gene complement for a phototroph and hence reduced uv protection machinery  <cit> . still, prochlorococcus is very abundant in the upper layer of most oligotrophic waters  and can sustain high growth rates in near surface, uv-irradiated waters  <cit> .

in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which prochlorococcus manages to cope with uv stress, we grew p. marinus strain pcc <dig> under quasi natural light conditions by using a custom-designed illumination system which provided a modulated l/d cycle of par and uv radiation. this system induced a very tight synchronization of cell cycle and division . most studies that have analyzed uv effects on cyanobacteria thus far have been performed on asynchronously growing cells either by abruptly subjecting cultures to short-term uv stress  or longer term acclimation to constant uv exposure  <cit> . the long term  response of cells is known to be significantly different from the short term  response, as it involves different sets of genes and regulation networks  <cit> . yet, the modulated character of uv stress in nature, its co-occurrence with high light stress  and the existence of long, dark recovery periods  are also very important factors to take into account to fully understand how cells can acclimate to uv stress in nature. the dynamic aspect of this stress triggers a succession of signalling, gene regulation and/or repair pathways that lead to a temporally complex, coordinated response  <cit> . this finely tuned orchestration of the transcriptome and metabolome cannot be observed after merely subjecting cultures to a continuous  uv treatment, as it generally provokes a "distress" response that may eventually activate programmed cell death  <cit> . in our experiments, even though p. marinus sp. pcc <dig> was growing at similar rates  in hl and hl+uv conditions , this strain could not tolerate a sudden shift from hl to hl+uv conditions, as this provoked a sharp decrease of its growth rate  and ultimately death of the culture within a few days . to successfully acclimate our cultures to our experimental hl+uv conditions, we therefore had to increase the uv dose incrementally with several days of acclimation at each step . thus, acclimation of prochlorococcus cells to uv stress is the result of a very subtle balance between the light environment experienced by cells in their specific niche  and a precise temporal succession of metabolic and repair processes that closely matches the ambient level of stress at any time of the day. hence, attempts to sample cells from their natural environment and to incubate them in other  conditions,  this hypothesis does not necessarily apply to other cyanobacteria that have a larger variety of uv protection systems  <cit>  or at least  a larger set of dna repair genes , conferring them with a better resistance to uv stress, and ii) pcc <dig> seems to cope with high light much better than with uv shock, since after cultures were shifted from ll to hl, their growth rate increased to one doubling per day by the day after the shift . in contrast, ll-adapted prochlorococcus spp. strains  seemingly need to be acclimated incrementally to higher irradiances  <cit> .

molecular bases of the chromosome replication delay
one of the main results of the present study is that p. marinus pcc <dig> can acclimate to relatively high doses of uv irradiation  by delaying dna synthesis  towards the dark period. this strategy could reduce the risk of uv-induced replication errors  <cit> . it is probable that this delay is also needed for cells to repair uv-induced damages to dna accumulated during the period preceding chromosome replication. in uv-irradiated cultures, we sometimes observed that a minor fraction of the population seemingly initiated chromosome replication at 15: <dig> , as suggested by the shoulder to the left of the s peak before dusk . however, the absence of any skew on the left of the corresponding g <dig> peak suggests that these cells either had an extended s phase  or died before completing dna replication. the maintenance of a high growth rate under hl+uv conditions favors the former hypothesis.

most uv-irradiated cells could not enter the s phase before complete darkness. one may wonder whether this observation is compatible with the occurrence of a uv stress-induced cell cycle "checkpoint", i.e. "a regulatory pathway that controls the order and timing of cell cycle transitions and ensure that critical events such as dna replication and chromosome segregation are completed with high fidelity"  <cit> . if it exists, this checkpoint could be a "dna replication initiation checkpoint", i.e. located before the g1-s transition. however, this hypothesis would not account for the previously mentioned small percentage of the population that was seemingly blocked in s. the occurrence of a "dna replication completion checkpoint" was suggested for uv-c irradiated e. coli cells  <cit> . cells in g <dig> could not start chromosome replication while s cells could not complete replication and hence divide; only cells already in g <dig> at the time of irradiation were able to complete cytokinesis. in our case, however, because of the tight synchronization of the population, virtually no cell was sufficiently advanced in the cell cycle during the pre-dusk period to complete cytokinesis.

it is generally thought that checkpoints are controlled by specific protein complexes involved in signaling  and/or checking  <cit> . thus, prochlorococcus might possess a uv sensor which, when detecting these wavelengths, could launch a cascade of controlling mechanisms ultimately stopping the replication machinery. a uv-b sensor was characterized in the diazotrophic cyanobacterium chlorogloeopsis sp. pcc <dig> and was shown to mediate the induction of mycosporine-like amino acids synthesis  <cit> . however, no evidence for such a uv sensor is available in prochlorococcus and, as argued later in this paper, its presence is rather unlikely. recently, cooper  <cit>  proposed that checkpoints may in fact result from purely internal controls. it is possible that pcc <dig> cells actually entered the early s phase but that the extensive occurrence of replication fork stalling due to accumulated dna lesions and the elevated need for recovery of the replication process by lesion removal and replisome reloading  <cit>  slowed down or even arrested the whole dna synthesis process for a few hours, therefore explaining the observed delay without any need for a light sensing signal. the fact that uv-acclimated cultures did not show any obvious decrease in their overall growth rate indicates that if stalling of replication forks occurred, efficient dna repair mechanisms must have allowed those cells blocked in s to restart and complete chromosome replication.

uv stress leads to the downregulation of dna replication and cell division genes
to further our understanding of the molecular bases of the observed delay in s phase completion, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in chromosome replication and cell division. as is typically observed in model bacteria  <cit> , the dnaa gene, encoding the master initiator protein of chromosome replication, was induced just before entry of cells into the s phase. although an increase in dnaa expression occurred at the same time under hl and hl+uv, its level of expression was considerably lower in the latter condition. it is well known in escherichia coli that initiation of chromosome replication depends on reaching a threshold level of dnaa protein  <cit> . thus, it is plausible that the low amounts of dnaa transcripts at 15: <dig> in uv-irradiated pcc <dig> cells  may have resulted in a decreased rate of dnaa protein accumulation in the cell, resulting in a several hour delay in the time at which the dnaa threshold concentration is reached. no homologs of regulators  known in other bacteria to control the mode of action of dnaa  <cit>  have yet been identified in pcc <dig>  still, one possible regulatory mechanism may involve atp, since it is a necessary co-factor transforming the inactive form of dnaa  into its active form , capable of initiating chromosome replication  <cit> . we hypothesize that the lowered expression levels of atp synthase genes in hl+uv during the daytime, as seen both in microarray  and qpcr analyses  could have caused a decrease in intracellular atp levels that might have also contributed to delayed dnaa induction activity in pcc <dig> 

even if the lowered expression of dnaa is sufficient by itself to explain the observed s phase delay, it appears that uv exposure also strongly affected the expression of several  genes involved in cell division, including ftsz and sepf, both encoding key components of the divisome  <cit> . this similar behavior suggests that the dna replication and cell division machineries could be controlled by the same regulatory network, though the timing of maximal expression varies between genes . sepf is thought to be involved in the polymerization and stability of ftsz filaments. marbouty and co-workers  <cit>  showed in vitro that sepf binds to preassembled ftsz polymers, suggesting that sepf is required only after all the ftsz protofilaments needed to make a z-ring have been synthesized. this hypothesis is consistent with the delay observed between the peaks of expression of ftsz and sepf in both light conditions.

dna repair genes are activated under high light
another surprising result from this study is that uv exposure did not result in any significant upregulation of dna repair genes , including some which are known to be involved in repairing damage specifically induced by uv stress. this includes the phra gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in repair  of the most frequent dna lesions in response to uv, i.e. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers . our results demonstrate that phra is also strongly expressed under hl, with a pattern during the day that somewhat matched the irradiance curve, suggesting that the expression of this gene is strongly regulated by light. recently, osburne and co-workers  <cit>  described a mutant of p. marinus med <dig> exhibiting high resistance to uv stress. by comparing the whole genomes of the mutant and wild type, they could only find a single point mutation, located upstream of a two-gene operon consisting of phra  and a gene coding for a nudix hydrolase . this mutation resulted in the constitutive expression of this operon even under non-inductive conditions, suggesting that the occurrence of high levels of dna photolyase and nudix hydrolase in the cells prior to uv treatment conferred these cells with better resistance to this stress than wild type cells, which needed some time to synthesize those proteins. in order to exclude the possibility that the pcc <dig> strain used in our experiments possessed the point mutation described by osburne and co-workers  <cit> , we used the pcr primers defined by authors to amplify this region directly from cells collected from each duplicate culture of the hl and hl+uv experiments. in all cases, the sequences were the same as for the wild type . it is noteworthy that zinser and co-workers  <cit> , who studied the diel variations of the whole transcriptome of l/d synchronized med <dig> cultures, observed a very different expression pattern for phra as we did here , with an increase at night and a decrease during the day . since they used a moderate light irradiance, reaching only one fourth of our hl conditions at virtual noon , it is possible that high par conditions are needed to trigger the synthesis of the dna photolyase.

the uvra gene showed an expression pattern very similar to that of phra in both conditions. it encodes the dna damage recognition component of the uvrabc system which in bacteria and archaea is involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway   <cit> . this pathway, which has the ability to repair a wide range of structurally unrelated dna lesions  <cit> , is seemingly fully functional in p. marinus pcc <dig>  since it possesses conserved homologs of all three subunits of the uvrabc system. in zinser and coworkers' study  <cit> , uvra transcript levels showed a rapid increase at the beginning of the light period, remained at quasi steady state during the rest of the day, then decreased at night . this indicates that the uvra system is also activated at moderate light, though it might not need to be adjusted as precisely to the ambient light as under hl.

another essential safeguard of genomic integrity in prokaryotes is the dna mismatch repair  pathway, which removes base mispairings, unpaired bases, and small insertion or deletion loops in dna by the concerted action of muts-l-h repair proteins  <cit> . the genome of p. marinus med <dig> contains one homolog of muts, which in e. coli encodes the dna damage recognition component of the mmr system. transcript levels of muts were the lowest at dawn, increased continuously during the light period and decreased at the beginning of the s phase, suggesting that expression of this gene could increase together with the accumulation of uv and/or reactive oxygen species-induced mutations to dna. however, no homologs of mutl, encoding an atpase that forms a complex with muts once the latter has recognized a dna lesion, and muth, coding for a restriction endonuclease that cleaves dna at gatc sites, can be found in the med <dig> genome . the following step of the mmr process, i.e. dna excision, is ensured in e. coli by several genes, including recj, which encodes a single-stranded dna-specific exonuclease and the xseab operon, which encodes the two subunits of the exodeoxyribonuclease vii  <cit> . surprisingly, homologs of these genes can be found in the genomes of the low light-adapted prochlorococcus ecotypes, but not in high light adapted ecotypes, including med <dig>  <cit> . thus, even though putative homologs of enzymes involved in dna resynthesis  are present in med <dig>  including ssb, which has been implicated in the repair of single strand breaks, and several dna ligases , biochemical studies are needed to determine whether muts is associated with an mmr-like system in hl-adapted p. marinus strains or if this system is absent in these organisms.

expression patterns of the umuc gene, encoding the subunit c of the umud'2c error-prone dna polymerase v , indicate that dna translesion synthesis  reactions, used to bypass lesions in dna templates on which pol iii usually stalls, occur in pcc <dig>  <cit> . the umuc gene expression increased during the g <dig> phase with a peak at noon and was downregulated during the s phase. interestingly, in hl+uv conditions, its expression level remained high during the entire period of s blockage. posttranslational activation of pol v requires the presence of reca nucleoprotein filaments bound to ssdna in order to generate its catalytically active form  <cit> . one can therefore speculate that, even though umuc expression was upregulated in the middle of the day under hl+uv conditions, the transcriptional repression of reca during that time may have delayed activation of pol v. as a result, stalled replication forks may have taken longer to be rescued  <cit> , providing another possible cause for the delay in s maximum observed under hl+uv. the umucd-dependent cell cycle checkpoint model proposed for e. coli  <cit>  may thus be applicable to p. marinus pcc <dig> 

while the ner  pathway is mainly active during the g <dig> phase, prochlorococcus cells seem to activate another dna repair system after the initiation of chromosome replication, namely the homologous recombination pathway that acts on double strand breaks. in this process, ruva and ruvb, form a complex that promotes branch migration of holliday junctions, then the endonuclease ruvc resolves the holliday junctions by introducing nicks into dna strands  <cit> . the fact that the diel expression pattern of the ruvc gene was similar under hl or hl+uv conditions suggests that the homologous recombination pathway is likely independent of the transcriptional control by the lexa/reca system , as is also the case in the freshwater cyanobacterium anabaena sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation of the sos response by lexa
the lexa protein of e. coli is a transcriptional repressor of the sos dna damage repair response, which is induced upon recognition of dna damage caused by a wide range of intra- and extracellular elicitors, including uv-irradiation, oxidative stress and dna replication abnormalities  <cit> . in pcc <dig>  the lexa expression pattern was almost the same under hl and hl+uv, suggesting that it is oxidative stress rather than uv which is the inducing factor for lexa expression. at a molecular level, de-repression of the forty-three genes constituting the lexa regulon in e. coli  <cit>  is dependent upon the autocatalytic cleavage of the lexa protein, which is stimulated in response to dna damage by interaction with ssdna-reca filaments  <cit> . this repressor cleavage reaction in e. coli requires several conserved sequence motifs in the lexa repressor, a catalytic serine nucleophile , a basic lysine residue  and an alanine-glycine cleavage bond   <cit> . absence of the lexa nucleophile and cleavage bond, a lack of lexa dna damage inducibility in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  and its involvement in carbon fixation led domain and co-workers  <cit>  to question whether the e. coli type sos regulon was conserved in cyanobacteria. however, sequence analysis of the lexa protein encoded by p. marinus med <dig> shows that these three sequence motifs are conserved . furthermore, a search for the lexa binding site in several prochlorococcus genomes, including med <dig>  <cit> , uncovered the consensus motif tagtaca-n2-tgtacta upstream of the reca, umuc and umud genes as well as lexa itself, a motif which is similar to the previously described consensus lexa site of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . therefore, unlike synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  it seems that p. marinus pcc <dig> could well possess a lexa-regulated dna repair system similar to that in e. coli. the different expression patterns of the lexa-controlled genes might reflect differences in the sequence conservation of this motif relative to the lexa consensus sequence  <cit> . still, the late occurrence during the cell cycle of the lexa gene expression peak and its concomitance with the reca expression maximum in hl conditions is somewhat surprising, given that their products act as repressor and activator of the sos response, respectively  <cit>  and one might have expected some differential expression patterns. the delay of the reca but not lexa expression peaks in uv-irradiated cells is therefore worth noting in this context as it is more compatible with the expected succession of lexa and reca regulators in the frame of a typical, coordinated sos response to dna damages  <cit> .

effect of uv on sigma factors and clock gene expression
zinser and coworkers  <cit>  recently showed that the five sigma factors of p. marinus med <dig> were differentially regulated by light and suggested that this differential phasing, which is in agreement with the idea that they compete for the same core rna polymerase, contribute to the variety of diel gene expression patterns observed within the whole transcriptome. in order to gain insight into the effects of uv irradiation on the diel rna accumulation patterns of these expression regulators in pcc <dig>  we studied the expression of two group ii sigma factors . their patterns of expression, which are globally consistent with those reported earlier  <cit> , suggests that rpod <dig> is maximally expressed shortly after dawn and one can hypothesize that its gene product  could control the expression of genes upregulated in the morning . similarly, rpod <dig> rna levels peak at ldt, and it is possible that rpod <dig> could control the expression of genes expressed during this period . the presence of uv radiation appeared to affect the expression patterns of both sigma factor genes. for rpod <dig>  because the daily amplitudes of variation were relatively modest , the differences observed during the light period might not be significant. in contrast, for rpod <dig>  there was a clear decrease in its relative expression at 15: <dig> in hl+uv compared to hl conditions, which could potentially result in a delay in the expression of the whole set of genes under the control of this sigma factor.

it has been proposed that the rpod <dig> sigma factor of synechococcus sp. strain pcc <dig> is involved in a circadian clock output pathway  <cit> . there is no direct ortholog of of the rpod <dig> gene in med <dig> , but one or several of the five sigma factors of this strain might have a similar function. the observed down-regulation of the circadian clock core oscillator kaib gene at noon under hl+uv conditions could result in a modification of the diel expression patterns of one or several of these sigma factors, which in turn modified the expression of genes under their control . another gene known to convey the circadian clock output signal is sasa, which encodes a sensory histidine kinase. like kaib, it is maximally expressed during the night and its expression dramatically decreased at the beginning of the light period. however, while in hl it recovered its expression just after noon, this recovery took much longer in the presence of uv radiation, which could also potentially affect expression of the whole transcriptome. indeed, sasa plays a key role in chromosome condensation and superhelicity status, which are known to regulate global gene expression and separation of replicated chromosomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we analyzed the response of prochlorococcus marinus pcc <dig> to an environmentally relevant uv stress, provided as a modulated light/dark cycle, as occurs in nature. our results show that the primary response of uv-irradiated prochlorococcus cultures involves a shift of chromosome replication phase towards the dark period, potentially minimizing the risk of uv-induced replication errors. since the genes involved in dna replication and cell division are most affected by uv stress, this delay of the s phase is probably related to the strong repression of those genes, in particular dnaa.

another important outcome of this work is that the strong synchronization of the pcc <dig> cells entrained by the modulated light-dark cycle allowed us to observe a clear temporal succession of the expression of genes encoding components of the different dna repair pathways through the day. the first line of defense is provided by the light-dependent repair of cpds by the dna photolyase and removal of damaged oligonucleotides by ner. the presence of a light-regulated muts gene suggests a possible involvement of mmr during g <dig>  but we have no clear evidence yet that a fully operational mmr system exists in pcc <dig>  at later stages of the l/d cycle, when irradiation levels reached their maxima, reca and lexa expression increase. we hypothesize that the sos response of pcc <dig> is activated later in the afternoon due to lexa inactivation, resulting in the de-repression of genes involved in reca-mediated hr events  and dna repair by the error-prone tls pathway  <cit> .

in summary, dna repair pathways appear to operate in a similar way in pcc <dig> than in well studied, model organisms such as e. coli or bacillus subtilis. the signal, if any, that activates the dna repair pathways in this organism is still unclear, however. if it operates through a photoreceptor, we predict that it involves a visible light sensor rather than a uv sensor. indeed, there is some evidence for the presence of a blue light photoreceptor in p. marinus med <dig>  <cit> . it must be noted that in the field, uv irradiation is always accompanied by high photon fluxes of visible light, so given its minimalist regulation system, it is quite possible that prochlorococcus has only one light signalling pathway for both stresses. alternatively, dna repair mechanisms could be activated by reactive oxygen species that are produced in response to both stresses  <cit> . further biochemical studies are needed to check which of our different hypotheses for the observed delay in s phase is the most likely.
