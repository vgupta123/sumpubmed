BACKGROUND
t lymphocytes can be subdivided into at least two types based on the expression of either the αβ or γδ t cell receptor. although both perceive antigen, they differ in the types of antigens with which they react. αβ t cell receptors react with antigenic protein peptides in the context of self major histocompatibility complex  proteins while γδ t cell receptors may react with proteins but this does not involve mhc presentation. they also react with autologous molecules on cells  <cit>  as well as nonproteinaceous molecules  <cit> . the gene repertoires that code for the γδ t cell receptor chains and the t cell receptor gamma  and delta  gene locus organizations have been extensively described for humans and mice but to a lesser extent for the artiodactyls which includes ruminants and swine. these latter are "γδ t cell high" species because of their high levels of γδ t cells in circulation . it is clear that while both αβ and γδ t cells have large and diverse t cell receptor gene repertoires  <cit> , "γδ t cell high" species have a trd gene repertoire that is much more extensive than that in the "γδ t cell low" species  <cit> . the bovine  locus organization and trd gene repertoire are the subject of this work.

t cell receptor delta and beta chains are encoded by the rearrangement of variable , joining  and diversity  genes making them more complex than the t cell receptor gamma and alpha chains which lack d gene products. in all mammals evaluated the genes encoding the t cell receptor beta and gamma chains are found at the t cell receptor beta  and trg loci, respectively. the genes that encode the t cell receptor delta and alpha chains are found at a single chromosomal location with the trd genes embedded within the t cell receptor alpha  locus. for both humans and mice these are located on chromosome  <dig> and encompass over  <dig> megabase  for the combined tra/trd locus  <cit> . the trd locus embedded within the tra locus spans approximately  <dig> kb in humans and  <dig> kb in mice. the loci comprise trdv genes , followed by trdd genes , trdj genes , a single trdc gene and an additional trdv gene that is located 3' of the trdc gene in an inverted transcriptional orientation  <cit> . in addition, five and ten functional trav/dv genes  have been identified for humans and mice, respectively, and these are found upstream of the embedded trd locus  <cit> .

limited evidence derived from analysis of cdna clones from cattle, sheep and swine, as well as limited germline information for sheep, suggests that the general organization of the bovine tra/trd locus does not differ greatly from that of humans and mice  <cit> . it also suggests that a much larger repertoire of trdv genes exists for cattle, as well as for the other "γδ t cell high" species sheep and swine  <cit> . indeed, recent mapping of the bovine tra/trd locus identified over  <dig> trdv and over  <dig> trav or trav/dv genes in cattle  <cit> . for cattle, four genes belonging to three different small subgroups  have been identified that are orthologous to those same subgroups in sheep  <cit> . in contrast, while the bovine trdv <dig> genes have been found to be related to the single trdv <dig> gene that occurs in humans, expansion of the trdv <dig> subgroup accounts for the larger number of trdv genes in the "γδ t cell high" species  <cit> . the swine and sheep trdv <dig> subgroups have been estimated to contain at least  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively  <cit>  while the bovine trdv <dig> subgroup has been reported to contain at least  <dig> genes  <cit> . however, current knowledge about ruminant and swine trd genes is predominantly based on cdna evidence rather than on genomic dna. because of this, it has been unclear whether the large number of cdna trdv <dig> sequences is the result of multiple genes or polymorphisms among animals; thus, there has been no clear way to classify and name these transcripts. by annotating the bovine genome btau_ <dig>  assembly, here we demonstrated the presence of  <dig> trdv genes,  <dig> of which belong to the trdv <dig> subgroup. we also proposed trdv <dig> sets to classify the bovine and ovine trdv <dig> genes based on their phylogenetic grouping.

the existence of multiple d and j genes also contributes to diversity of possible t cell receptor delta chain amino acid sequences since a particular trdv gene is expected to be able to recombine with any d and j gene. the region of the protein derived from the v-d-j gene rearrangement is known as the complementarity determining region  <dig> , while the cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> loops are germline-encoded by the trdv gene. the v-d-j gene rearrangement involves recognition of the recombination signal  sequences for subsequent dna cleavage by the enzymes rag <dig> and rag <dig>  <cit> . t cell receptor delta chain sequence diversity is augmented by junctional flexibility and the addition of n and p nucleotides. rs flank the v, d and j genes and are composed of highly conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by either a  <dig> base pair  spacer  or a  <dig> bp spacer . since the conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences and spacer lengths have been found to be important for efficient recombination  <cit>  they were also evaluated here. finally, recent evidence demonstrated that diversity of t cell receptor delta chain sequences is amplified by the occurrence of multiple trdd genes within a single cdr <dig>  <cit> . thus we also evaluated trdd gene usage by analyzing cdna sequences and report those findings here.

RESULTS
gene structure and genomic organization of bovine trd genes
here we set out to annotate and classify the bovine trd genes. prior to the initiation of the studies described here many cdna sequences representing trdv <dig> gene transcripts had been reported  <cit>  but the actual number of functional bovine trdv <dig> genes and their sequences was unknown. as a result it was not possible to differentiate between cdna sequences derived from distinct genes and those that represented polymorphisms of the same gene among animals. furthermore, the existence of trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes had been demonstrated  <cit> , along with the trdj and trdd genes  <cit> , but their numbers and placement within the bovine genome had not been definitively described.

the exon-intron structures of trdv genes  and of the single trdc gene  were determined. a trdv gene encompasses a coding region of approximately  <dig> bp and comprises two exons. the first exon, l-part <dig>  is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp in length for trdv1/trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig>  respectively. the second exon, v-exon, is between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length for trdv <dig>  and is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp long for trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig>  respectively. the trdc gene encompasses a coding region of  <dig> bp comprising three exons. rs sequences were identified, as expected, adjacent to the 3' end of each v-exon  while the termination codon was at the 3' end of trdc exon  <dig> 

1gene designations with the same symbols denote gene models that are thought to be representative of the same gene based on analysis of genomic sequence.

2na denotes identified genes lacking glean models.

the number of functional trd genes among mammalian species is compared in table  <dig>  all species evaluated have genes for at least three trdv subgroups. it is notable that humans have only a single trdv <dig> gene  while the trdv <dig> subgroup in cattle and other artiodactyls are large, multigene families. because of the disparity in numbers of trdv <dig> genes in the human and cattle genomes, organization of their tra/trd loci cannot be compared. furthermore, additional assembly of the bovine genome is required in order to definitively determine the size of the tra/trd locus, to refine the gene organization, and to evaluate duplication events that resulted in the large trdv <dig> subgroup. schematic representations for regions in which three or more trdv genes were identified are shown . schematics are shown to scale and gene orientation is as indicated, based on the btau_ <dig>  assembly. as in other species, a single trdc gene  as well as one trdv gene located downstream of trdc in an inverted transcriptional orientation  were identified  <cit> . in some cases multiple gene models were found to represent the same gene  and therefore subsequent analyses were performed after removing redundant sequences. it is likely that the occurrence of redundant sequences is a result of assembly anomalies; however, it is also possible that these duplicated trdv genes are in fact present within the bovine genome.

trdv gene analysis
deduced amino acid sequences of the  <dig> trdv genes identified here were initially aligned using clustalw <dig>  <cit> . alignments were refined in bioedit according to the imgt unique numbering for the v-domain  <cit> , visualized with jalview  <cit>  and are shown  with imgt numbering and framework regions  and cdr, as indicated. trdv <dig> genes reported here are temporarily designated trdv1a - trdv1bp until the entire chromosomal sequence has been assembled. trdv <dig> genes encode cdr <dig> that range in length from five to ten amino acids  while trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes all encode cdr <dig> that are seven amino acids in length. in contrast, most cdr <dig> of trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes were three amino acids in length, except for four of the trdv <dig> genes as noted below, while that of trdv <dig> was five amino acids long. in all but two cases , trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes encode a qxs motif in the cdr <dig>  interestingly, trdv1f, trdv1ae, trdv1ar and trdv1o  all contained a deletion which spans the last fr <dig> amino acid to the fifth fr <dig> amino acid, resulting in a lack of cdr <dig> in those genes. an identical deletion had also been found in the sheep trdv1s <dig> gene  <cit> . also, the rs of trdv1bg and trdv1bj were found to occur farther downstream than those of the other trdv <dig> genes identified here, resulting in a putative transcript that extends  <dig>  or  <dig>  amino acids beyond the conserved 2nd-cys  <dig>  as opposed to extending only three or four amino acids which is the case for the other trdv <dig> genes. because of the unusual nature of those six genes, until their expression by γδ t cells is validated they will be considered orf instead of functional as defined by imgt  <cit> . 2d structure graphical representations of trdv <dig>  trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes  were generated using imgt/v-quest  <cit>  and the imgt/collier-de-perles tool program  <cit> . the cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> loops are indicated in red and yellow, respectively. the amino acids 1st-cys  <dig>  conserved-trp  <dig>  hydrophobic amino acid   <dig> and 2nd-cys  <dig>  which are conserved in all four trdv subgroups, are shown with letters in red.

as for sheep, genes in the bovine trdv <dig> family share many characteristics including a  <dig> amino acid long highly conserved leader region and the yfc motif found in the 3' end of fr <dig> . however, bovine trdv <dig> genes described here were further classified into eleven sets by constructing a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method allowing us to compare them to equivalent human, mouse and ovine sequences . the grouping of ovine trdv <dig> genes by this method corresponded with what had been previously described  <cit> . the tree shows grouping of bovine trdv <dig> gene sequences into eleven sets, as indicated, and the percentage interior test values  are shown for each set. classification was further supported based on cdr characteristics used to classify ovine trdv <dig> genes  <cit>  . previously described characteristics used to classify trdv <dig> genes included cdr <dig> length , the chemical characteristics of the amino acid at position  <dig>  and the presence or absence of trp  <dig> in cdr <dig>  the number of trdv <dig> genes evaluated here that occur within each set is also shown  with set  <dig> being the largest and set  <dig> being the smallest. while some sets can share the same features reported in table  <dig>  the classification of trdv <dig> genes into those separate sets is supported based on the phylogenetic analysis  and additional sequence features .

when bovine trdv <dig> rs  and ovine trdv <dig> rs  were evaluated, a high level of sequence conservation was observed both among and within species, as depicted in the sequence logos shown in figure 5a. when the rs of bovine trdv <dig> orthologs were compared  a similarly high level of sequence conservation was observed among species . in contrast, comparison of the remaining trdv rs  revealed conservation in only the heptamer and nonamer sequences . this is consistent with the lack of relatedness of these genes as determined based on sequence analysis . overall, sequence conservation was observed within the rs heptamer and nonamer of all trdv genes, regardless of species .

trdd and trdj gene analysis
genomic locations, sequences and rs of bovine trdd and trdj genes were also determined  and confirmed what had been reported previously  <cit> . evidence for five trdd genes was found and deduced amino acid sequences for all three open reading frames are shown in additional file   <dig>  additional putative trdd genes were identified based on potential rs ; however, subsequent cdna sequence analyses provided little or no evidence that those putative trdd genes were valid and thus they are not presented. three trdj genes were found and their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are also reported in additional file  <dig>  alignments comparing bovine, ovine, swine, human and mouse trdj gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown . a phylogenetic tree , constructed using the neighbor-joining method to evaluate the relatedness of the above sequences, reflected the alignment.

bovine, human and murine 5'd-rs and 3'd-rs of trdd genes and j-rs of trdj genes were evaluated for sequence conservation . despite a low number of sequences used in the comparisons  there appeared to be conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences among the rs for all species evaluated. although heptamers were found to vary, as expected, they all contained the 5' cac  consensus sequence which has been found to be critical for recombination  <cit> . nonamers generally contained the previously reported consensus sequence acaaaaacc  <cit>   although this was found to be less conserved. this is consistent with findings that the nonamer sequence requirements are less rigid than those for the heptamer sequence in order to obtain efficient recombination  <cit> .

cdna analysis as evidence for trd gene usage
prior to these studies the number of trdv <dig> genes found in the bovine genome, and their sequences, had not been resolved. therefore, it was impossible to classify cloned trdv <dig> sequences based on their encoding genes. furthermore, trdv <dig> genes are highly polymorphic but the subgroup also contains genes that differ by only one or three nucleotides in their coding regions . therefore, it has been very difficult to differentiate between expressed trdv <dig> sequences with regard to whether they represent the same or different genes. here we classified previously-identified trdv <dig> cloned cdna sequences based on several criteria which included their relative placement in trees based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, specific sequence characteristics and percent identities based on nucleotide sequence alignments . results are summarized in table  <dig> with the provisional imgt nomenclature, corresponding genes and trdv <dig> sets  indicated.

6cdna sequence used for comparison was partial.

in some cases it was impossible to classify trdv <dig> cdna sequences definitively, because some trdv <dig> genes share very high sequence identity; those cases are indicated in table  <dig>  furthermore, in  <dig> cases  no corresponding trdv <dig> genes could be identified although cdna sequences were found to have features characteristic of particular sets, as indicated. it is possible that no corresponding genes were found because additional trdv <dig> genes are present in the bovine genome but were not identified in this study due to gaps in the analyzed regions of the btau_ <dig>  assembly. only cdna sequences that differed from potential corresponding gene sequences by six or fewer nucleotides were classified; however, it remains possible that those cdna sequences are not in fact representative of the genes indicated. overall, corresponding genes were identified for most cdna sequences , although  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted trdv <dig> genes reported here lacked cdna confirmation and those genes were found to be distributed among all sets. last, for the sake of completeness we note that cdna evidence for bovine trdv <dig>  trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes reported here has already been demonstrated  <cit>  and has been confirmed  <cit> .

identification of the trdd genes within the bovine genome allowed us to evaluate trdd gene usage in cdna sequences that had been previously sequenced in our laboratory. cdr <dig> of  <dig> trdv <dig>   <dig> trdv <dig>   <dig> trdv <dig> and  <dig> trdv <dig> containing sequences were analyzed . all d genes were represented in transcripts containing genes of the four trdv subgroups. p nucleotides were observed flanking untrimmed trdd regions and extensive n-regions were frequently found between trdd regions. some cases were ambiguous because nucleotides could be attributed to either p- or n-region but also to the presence of more than one trdd gene. therefore, we applied the criteria that at least six nucleotides of a particular trdd gene must be present to claim usage of that gene with reasonable confidence. examples of trdd gene usage with nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown . these demonstrated the incorporation of one to five trdd genes within a single cdr <dig>  only cases in which the order of trdd genes in the cdr <dig> corresponded to that found in the genome were retained.

discussion
in order to evaluate and characterize the bovine t cell receptor delta gene repertoire and their genomic organization we annotated the trd genes in the btau_ <dig>  assembly. here we describe the existence of two trdv <dig> genes, as well as a single gene each for trdv <dig> and trdv <dig>  we confirmed the presence of three trdj and five trdd genes  <cit>  and evaluated trd junctional diversity incorporating these genes. furthermore, we described the existence of  <dig> trdv <dig> genes , evaluated them for their sequence characteristics and further classified them into eleven sets based on phylogenetic analysis. as for other mammals, the bovine trd locus was found embedded within the tra locus and thus trdv <dig> genes were distributed amongst the trav genes. indeed, there were a number of genes for which assignment to the trav or trdv group was ambiguous. it is important to note that the presence of trav/dv genes is certain and has been reported  <cit>  but the ability of trdv or trav genes  to rearrange with either trdd or traj must be determined experimentally and will be evaluated in future studies. evaluation of the genes contained within the tra/trd locus was reported  <cit>  following the initial submission of this work with overall findings similar to those discussed here.

the question remains as to whether or not the findings reported here represent the complete trd gene repertoire because of the gaps in the btau_ <dig>  assembly. the presence of additional trdv <dig> genes is almost certain because of extensive gaps in this region although it is unlikely that additional trdd or trdj genes are present in the genome since that region is fully scaffolded and has been carefully evaluated for the presence of additional genes. that region also contains trdv <dig> and its analysis is likely definitive. in addition, previous cdna evidence supports the existence of only two trdv <dig> genes  <cit>  and is consistent with our findings. the existence of two trdv <dig> genes has been reported  <cit>  but is not supported by our findings which may be due to gaps in the genome assembly. even with gaps, locus organization can be assisted by comparison to other species. indeed, all mammals studied have genes that are closely related to human trdv <dig> with some being distributed among the trav genes. the bovine trdv <dig> gene is located downstream of the single trdc gene in inverse orientation, as found for the human trdv <dig> and mouse trdv <dig> genes. it is notable that there is significant sequence conservation among the orthologous bovine trdv <dig>  human trdv <dig>  mouse trdv <dig> and ovine trdv <dig> genes as well as their entire rs. this suggests that they derive from a common ancestral gene that appeared before the separation of these species. by comparison, there are no human or mouse genes that are equivalent to bovine trdv <dig> or trdv <dig>  the enormous expansion of the trdv <dig> repertoire that has been observed for cattle, sheep and pig  <cit>  is striking when compared with the single trdv <dig> gene found in human  and thus does not assist us in predicting the extent of the possible missing information.

trdv <dig> gene subgroup expansion is also striking when compared with other trdv gene subgroups which, even in artiodactyls, are found to contain only one or two members. while the number of trgv genes found in each species does not vary considerably  <cit> , expansion of the trdv <dig> genes in bovine, sheep and pig is consistent with them being "γδ t cell high" species, implying that this increase in antigen receptor diversity permits them to be stimulated by and to respond to more types of antigens. the presence of fewer trdv genes in "γδ t cell low" species, such as humans and mice, suggests that these species evolved so that γδ t cells play a less important role in their immune function. sequence conservation among bovine trdv <dig> rs , supports the concept that the large trdv <dig> subgroup arose from multiple duplication events. many bovine trdv <dig> genes share high percent identities, indicating that in some cases this subgroup is not as diverse as the number of individual genes might suggest. for example, some trdv <dig> sequences differed by as few as four , three  or even one  nucleotide in their coding regions even though all were determined to be distinct genes based on analysis of the flanking genomic sequences. however, it cannot be ruled out that some of these gene models represent the same gene but do not appear as such due to sequencing and/or assembly anomalies. the question of why numerous and highly similar trdv <dig> genes have been maintained in the bovine genome is compelling and studies to evaluate their functions will be pursued.

based on phylogenetic sequence analysis and gene features, we subdivided the bovine trdv <dig> genes into eleven sets. each set corresponds to intraspecies gene duplications of ancestral genes that were present before the separation between bovine and ovine species. we also assigned bovine cdna sequences to germline genes identified in this work . of  <dig> previously identified trdv <dig> cdna sequences evaluated,  <dig> could not be assigned to a germline gene, possibly because of gaps in that region of the genome assembly. of the  <dig> trdv <dig> genes identified in this study, cdna evidence existed for only  <dig>  it is possible that, because a majority of the previously identified trdv <dig> cdna sequences were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> , the remaining trdv <dig> genes that lack cdna verification might be expressed in other tissues that have not been evaluated. it is also possible that other factors, such as age or immunological experience, might impact the expression of particular genes and thus prevented verification of those genes. future studies will focus on specifically amplifying individual trdv <dig> transcripts in order to verify that they are functional and to determine whether they are expressed in an age and/or tissue dependent manner.

the potential importance of the role of the t cell receptor delta rearranged cdr <dig> is evident instudies evaluating the binding of the t <dig> and t <dig> antigens  <cit>  by murine γδ t cells since antigen recognition by the cdr <dig> was found to be autonomous, that is, not dependent on the trdv gene associated with it  <cit> . it could be reasoned that, because the genomes of humans and mice lack the extensive trdv repertoirethat has been observed in artiodactyls, thiswould be compensated for by diversity of the genes that rearrange to form the cdr <dig> . moreover, because many bovine trdv <dig> amino acid sequences are very similar, structurally it might be expected that their ligand binding regionsincluding cdr <dig> would also need to be as diverse as that in humans and mice. humans have three trdd and four trdj genes while mice have two trdd and two trdj genes. with the exception of the human trdj genes, these numbers all fall short of the five trdd and three trdj genes identified in cattle. we demonstrated here that in cattle the trd cdr <dig> contained combinations that include between one and five trdd genes and would range in length from nine to  <dig> amino acids. with the exception of trdd <dig>  the germline bovine trdd genes predominantly encode glycine and the hydrophobic residues valine and tryptophan, with the neutral residues threonine and tyrosine being encoded to a lesser extent . this is reminiscent of findings for the equine vh cdr <dig> loops in which a higher proportion of glycine and lower proportion of cysteine content was identified when sequences were compared with those from humans, sheep and pigs  <cit> . as was suggested for equine vh cdr <dig>  this indicates that bovine trdv cdr <dig> loops have increased flexibility and are therefore better suited to recognize a large number of antigenic conformations. considering this, it is unlikely that cdr <dig> diversity in mice and humans compensates for their less diverse trdv repertoire and, in fact, it seems that cattle have more scope for antigen binding on all levels.

if the highly diverse cdr <dig> is indeed the main structural component involved in antigen recognition, then the trdv gene products might be most important for interactions with co-receptors or antigen presenting cells, whatever their nature may be. while the interactions between γδ t cell receptor and the antigens that they bind are still largely unknown, it has been demonstrated that for αβ t cell receptor the cdr <dig> loops  are involved with binding peptide as well as mhc. the cdr <dig> loops  bind only mhc. the trdv cdr <dig> in cattle exhibited diverse lengths and were generallyfound to be five to ten amino acids long as for mouse and human trdv, trbv and trav cdr <dig>  thisdiverse bovine trdv cdr <dig> repertoire may contribute to antigen binding in contrast to what has been reported for murine γδ t cell recognition of t <dig> as described above. it was found that bovine trdv <dig> cdr <dig> were either only three amino acids long or absent completely  in contrast to trbv cdr <dig> lengths of five to seven amino acids in mammals. it is yet to be determined whether the trdv <dig> genes lacking cdr <dig> are functional, however, if they are found to be so this lackof, or abbreviation of, the cdr <dig> inbovine trdv <dig> genes is logical since γδ t cells are not mhc-restricted.

CONCLUSIONS
based on annotations of the bovine genome we identified the trd genes including  <dig> trdv genes, five trdd genes, three trdj genes and the single trdc gene and described their organization within the trd locus. furthermore, we report that the trdv <dig> subgroup contains  <dig> genes, indicating that this subgroup underwent expansion as has been found for sheep and swine. also, because this large gene subgroup has been maintained in the bovine genome this indicates a unique role for these genes in γδ t cell biology.
