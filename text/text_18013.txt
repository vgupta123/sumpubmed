BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae, one of the group b streptococci , is a leading cause of bovine mastitis  <cit>  and has been implicated in cases of invasive disease in humans since the 1960s and 1970s  <cit> . gbs have emerged as major pathogens in neonates  <cit>  and in elderly adults, in whom they cause invasive infections, such as meningitis, soft tissue infections, endocarditis and osteoarticular infections  <cit> . there is a considerable body of evidence to suggest a genetic link between bovine isolates and the emerging human isolates  <cit> .

gbs isolates were initially distinguished on the basis of differences in capsule polysaccharides, giving rise to  <dig> different serotypes  <cit> . serotype iii has been identified as a marker of late-onset neonatal disease isolates  <cit> , but serotyping does not have sufficient discriminatory power to distinguish between isolates. molecular methods have therefore been developed to determine the genetic relationships between isolates: multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  <cit> , ribotyping  <cit> , random amplified polymorphism dna   <cit>  and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> . these methods make it possible to compare isolates and to define particular bacterial genogroups associated with invasive isolates in neonates. these findings were confirmed by multilocus sequence typing, as described by jones et al.  <cit> . other studies have shown that sequence type  <dig>  isolates are associated with invasive behavior  <cit> . two methods are currently used to explore the genetic links between isolates: pfge for epidemiological studies, and mlst for both epidemiological and phylogenetic studies.

analyses of fully sequenced bacterial genomes have revealed the existence of tandemly repeated sequences varying in size, location and the type of repetition  <cit> . tandem repeats  consist of a direct repetition of between one and more than  <dig> nucleotides, which may or may not be perfectly identical, located within or between genes. depending on the size of the unit, the tr may be defined as a microsatellite  or a minisatellite   <cit> . a fraction of these repeated sequences display intraspecies polymorphism and are described as vntrs . the proportion of vntrs in the genome varies between bacterial species. indeed, variation in the number of repeats at particular loci is used by some bacteria as a means of rapid genomic and phenotypic adaptation to the environment  <cit> .

a molecular typing method based on vntrs variability has recently been developed and applied to the typing of several bacterial pathogens  <cit> . multiple locus vntr analysis, or mlva, is a pcr-based method that was originally developed for the typing of haemophilus influenzae  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit>  and two bacterial species with potential for use in bioterrorism, bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis  <cit> . this method has since been shown to be useful for the genotyping of several other bacterial species causing disease in humans, including streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> , legionella pneumophila  <cit> , brucella  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . this technique has several advantages. for example, in bacterial species with high levels of genetic diversity, the study of six to eight markers is sufficient for accurate discrimination between strains  <cit> . highly monomorphic species, such as b. anthracis, may be typed by mlva, but this requires the use of a larger number of markers   <cit> . the discriminatory power of mlva may also be increased by adding extra panels of more polymorphic markers  <cit>  or by sequencing repeated sequences displaying internal variability  <cit> . conversely, the evaluation of differences in the number of repeats only, on the basis of mlva, is a cheap and rapid method that is not technically demanding. the work of radtke et al. showed relevance of mlva for s. agalactiae genotyping  <cit> .

our aim in this study was to develop a mlva scheme for the genotyping of a population of s. agalactiae strains of various origins previously characterized by mlst.

methods
strains
our collection consisted of  <dig> epidemiologically unrelated s. agalactiae strains, isolated from humans and cattle between  <dig> and  <dig> in france. five of the  <dig> human strains were isolated from the gastric fluid of neonates,  <dig> were isolated from cases of vaginal carriage,  <dig> were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and  <dig> were isolated from cultures of blood from adults presenting confirmed endocarditis according to the modified duke criteria  <cit> . the  <dig> bovine strains were isolated from cattle presenting clinical signs of mastitis. we also studied three reference strains: nem <dig>  a <dig> and  <dig> v/r. each strain had previously been identified on the basis of gram-staining, colony morphology, beta-hemolysis and lancefield group antigen determination . the capsular serotype was identified with the pastorex® rapid latex agglutination test  and by molecular serotyping, as described by manning et al.  <cit> . we were unable to determine the serotype for  <dig> strains.

dna extraction
the bacteria were lysed mechanically with glass beads and their genomic dna was extracted with an invisorb® spin cell mini kit .

mlst and assignment to clonal clusters
mlst was carried out as previously described  <cit> . briefly, pcr was used to amplify small  fragments from seven housekeeping genes  chosen on the basis of their chromosomal location and sequence diversity. the seven pcr products were purified and sequenced and an allele number was assigned to each fragment on the basis of its sequence. a sequence type , based on the allelic profile of the seven amplicons, was assigned to each strain. the sequences of all new alleles and the composition of the new sts identified are available from http://pubmlst.org/sagalactiae/. strains were grouped into clonal complexes  with eburst software  <cit> . an eburst clonal complex  was defined as all allelic profiles sharing six identical alleles with at least one other member of the group. the term "singleton st" refers to a st that did not cluster into a cc.

identification of vntr loci
tandem repeats were identified in the sequenced genomes of the three reference strains, nem <dig>  a <dig> and  <dig> v/r, with the microbial tandem repeats database http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr <cit>  and the tandem repeats finder program  <cit> . we determined the size of the repeat sequence and the number of repeat units for the three reference strains. blast analysis was carried out to determine whether the repeats were located within or between genes and to identify a hypothetical function for the open reading frame involved. the tr locus name was defined according to the following nomenclature: common name_size of the repeat sequence_size of the amplicon for the reference strain_corresponding number of repeats . the primers used for amplification targeted the 5' and 3' flanking regions of selected loci and matched the sequences present at these positions in the genomes of strains nem <dig>  a <dig> and  <dig> v/r. we initially selected and evaluated  <dig> tandem repeats with repeat units of more than  <dig> bp in length. some trs were not present in all the strains, some were present in all strains and displayed no polymorphism, and others were too large for amplification in standard conditions. six trs were retained for this study, selected on the basis of their greater stability and discriminatory power for four of the six .

multiple locus vntr analysis 
the primers used for the vntrs amplification are presented in table  <dig>  three loci have already been described by radtke et al. in a contemporary study but were amplified here with other primers  <cit>  . for the sag <dig> locus, no amplification was observed with primers directly flanking the tr for 14%  of the strains. a second primer pair targeting larger consensual flanking regions was designed to confirm the absence of the locus. pcr was performed in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> ng dna,  <dig> × pcr reaction buffer,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> , 5% dmso ,  <dig> unit of taq dna polymerase ,  <dig> μm of each dntp and  <dig>  μm of each flanking primer . amplification was performed in a  <dig> thermal cycler  under the following conditions: initial denaturation for  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation for  <dig> s at 94°c, annealing for  <dig> s at 50°c and elongation for  <dig> s at 72°c plus a final elongation step for  <dig> min at 72°c. we separated  <dig> μl of pcr product by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel , which was also loaded with a  <dig> bp dna size ladder . electrophoresis was performed in  <dig> cm-long gels, in 1× tbe buffer  containing  <dig> μg/ml ethidium bromide run at  <dig> v/cm. in each run, at least one lane was loaded with pcr product from one of the reference strains, nem <dig>  a <dig> or  <dig> v/r. the gels were photographed under ultraviolet illumination, with vision-capt® software . the number of repeats for each vntr was deduced from amplicon size, by comparison with the reference strain, for which the number of repeats was known. the allele number corresponded to the number of repeats. for the sag <dig> locus, the lack of a vntr was revealed by the absence of amplification with the first primer pair and the amplification of a fragment of the expected size with the second primer pair, which targeted larger consensual flanking regions. in this case, an allele number of  <dig> was given. for the sag <dig> locus, a  <dig> bp pcr product was obtained, demonstrating deletion of the inserted sequence and, thus, the absence of a vntr. an allele number of  <dig> was also assigned in this case. the mlva genotype of a strain was expressed as its allelic profile, corresponding to the number of repeats at each vntr, listed in the order sag <dig>  sag <dig>  sag <dig>  sag <dig>  sag <dig>  sag <dig>

data analysis
the polymorphism index of individual or combined vntr loci was calculated with the hunter-gaston diversity index  <cit> , an application of simpson's index of diversity  <cit> . confidence intervals  were calculated as described by grundmann et al.  <cit> . the categorical coefficient  and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  clustering approaches were run within bionumerics. a cutoff value of 50% similarity was applied to define mlva clusters. the minimum spanning tree  was generated with bionumerics. each circle represents an mlva genotype and its size is proportional to the number of strains. a logarithmic scale was used when drawing branches. the thicker branches link the mlva genotypes differing by only one allele, the thinner branches link mlva genotypes differing by more than one allele.

RESULTS
mlst genotyping
mlst was performed on the  <dig> s. agalactiae strains, identifying a total of  <dig> individual sts. eburst analysis clustered the sts into five clonal complexes , two groups with only two sts and six singletons . two of the ccs -- cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  -- accounted for 72%  of the strains. cc <dig> accounted for 8%  of the strains. the various serotypes of s. agalactiae were distributed between multiple ccs and singleton sts. sts were characterized by a predominant serotype: serotype v in st- <dig>  serotype iii in st- <dig> and st- <dig>  serotype ib in st- <dig> and st- <dig>  st- <dig> contained two serotypes . the population was therefore representative of s. agalactiae diversity in terms of anatomic origin, serotypes and clonal complexes .

description of the mlva scheme
the six vntrs were amplified from all  <dig> strains. mlva was carried out with individual pcrs and agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplicons, as shown in figure  <dig>  for a subset of vntrs. the repeat unit size of the six vntrs was between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, making it straightforward to estimate the size of amplicons on agarose gels. for sag <dig>  sag <dig>  sag <dig> and sag <dig>  amplicons were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in size and were readily resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis . for sag <dig>  and sag <dig> , few amplicons exceeded  <dig>  bp and extensive electrophoretic separation was required for precise estimations of size. for sag <dig>  three strains gave rise to amplicons of more than  <dig> bp in size. this made it difficult to assess the number of repeats with any degree of precision, and an arbitrary allele number of >  <dig> was assigned in these cases. for sag <dig>  no amplification with the first primer pair was observed for 14% of strains. this locus is part of a genomic island and a second primer pair targeting consensual flanking regions beyond the borders of this genomic island was designed to confirm the deletion of the vntr locus. the number of alleles was between two for sag <dig> and  <dig> for sag <dig>  thus, this mlva method combined markers with a low discriminatory power  with highly discriminant markers, such as sag <dig>  with the exception of sag <dig>  the vntrs used in this mlva method were located within open reading frames . sag <dig> is located upstream from the gene encoding the ribosomal protein s10; sag <dig> is located within dnaj, encoding a co-chaperone protein . sag <dig> is located within fbsa, encoding a protein involved in adhesion. sag <dig>  sag <dig> and sag <dig> are located in a "predicted coding region" of unknown function.

mlva genotyping and clustering
the mlva scheme resolved  <dig> genotypes among the  <dig> strains . five mlva genotypes were represented by more than five strains: genotype  <dig> , genotype  <dig> , genotype  <dig> , genotype  <dig>  and genotype  <dig> . seventy-five mlva genotypes were represented by only one strain . s. agalactiae strains of different origins were spread among a number of mlva genotypes. however 66%  of the strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid were confined to four mlva genotypes . an mlva cluster was defined by a cutoff value of 50% similarity with the upgma algorithm . nine mlva clusters, each containing more than four strains, were identified  . all clusters other than cluster  <dig> were congruent with the two algorithms, upgma and mst.

mlva
each mlva genotype is expressed as its allelic profile, corresponding to the number of repeats at each vntr 

comparison of mlva and mlst clustering
mlva clustering showed a clonal distribution of the population similar to that obtained by mlst . all human strains of mlst cc <dig> clustered together in mlva cluster  <dig> and the bovine strains of mlst cc <dig> belonged to several mlva clusters, suggesting greater heterogeneity of this population . with the exception of  <dig> strains, the mlst cc <dig> strains clustered into  <dig> linked mlva clusters, mlva cluster  <dig> and mlva cluster  <dig>  the mlst cc <dig> strains of serotype iii and the mlst cc <dig> strains clustered into mlva cluster  <dig>  the strains from mlst cc <dig> serotype ia also formed a separate group, the mlva cluster  <dig> 

discrimination of s. agalactiae strains by mlva
the diversity index obtained with mlva was  <dig>  , which is greater than that obtained with mlst . for the population studied, mlva distinguished  <dig> genotypes, whereas mlst distinguished  <dig> different sts. a much higher level of diversity was observed with mlva, particularly within the major ccs. for example, the  <dig> cc <dig> strains were separated into  <dig> sts by mlst and  <dig> mlva genotypes; the  <dig> cc <dig> strains were separated into  <dig> sts by mlst and  <dig> mlva genotypes and the  <dig> cc <dig> strains were separated into  <dig> sts by mlst and  <dig> mlva genotypes. nevertheless, two genotypes  accounted for 76%  of cc <dig> strains of human origin. for this particular genogroup, the discriminatory power of the mlva method was greater than that of mlst, although it remained low.

discussion
in this study, we applied the multi locus vntr analysis  typing method to s. agalactiae. vntr analysis, a method based on tandem repeat polymorphisms at multiple loci, has been successfully applied to many other bacterial species  <cit> . we investigated the relevance of this tool for the genotyping of s. agalactiae, by testing this method on six vntr loci in  <dig> strains previously characterized by mlst and serotyping. the mlva- <dig> scheme is inexpensive and can be carried out with the equipment routinely used for pcr amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis. for the six vntr loci, amplification was achieved with all the strains tested. for sag <dig>  a second pcr targeting a larger flanking region was required for 14% of the strains, which did not have a  <dig> kb genomic island encompassing the vntr. the repeat sizes of the six vntrs were sufficiently large for evaluation of the number of repeats on agarose gels. moreover, the conversion of results into allelic profiles should make it possible to construct databases for exchange between laboratories. the mlva- <dig> scheme includes a set of markers with different diversity indices, making it suitable for epidemiological studies. markers with a moderate diversity and small number of alleles  define clusters, whereas markers displaying more rapid evolution reflect variability within clusters. the mlva- <dig> method described here is a rapid, reproducible and epidemiologically meaningful typing tool.

three loci studied in the present mlva scheme are in common with the mlva scheme proposed by radtke et al.  <cit> . the  <dig> additional loci studied here provide more weight to clusters while maintaining a high discrimination power. moreover, in the mlva scheme proposed here, only one locus  was missing in some strains , and another primer pair targeting larger consensual flanking region confirmed the absence of this locus with a specific amplification. unlike radtke et al., we sought to develop a mlva scheme in which a pcr product was amplified in all strains whether the vntr was present or absent. in fact, negative amplification may result from the lack of a vntr locus or modification of the flanking regions, especially as some vntrs are close to transposases or insertion sequences such as sag <dig>  which is close to is <dig>  thus, the possibility of negative amplification for  <dig> out of  <dig> vntr loci in the radtke et al. mlva analysis could be a real problem in terms of resolution and reproducibility of the genotyping method. nevertheless, cumulative works allow to define the best set of vntr loci, as has already been done for other bacterial species such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit>  and staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . finally, the study of  <dig> isolates of bovine origin provided information about their distribution, especially those belonging to mlst cc <dig> 

population analysis by mlva revealed a clonal distribution of the strains similar to that obtained by mlst. the greater discriminatory index of mlva  made it possible to distinguish between strains within the clonal complexes defined by mlst. thus, mlva divided cc <dig> into two groups: one associated with serotype iii and the other associated with serotype ia. moreover, mlva also separated cc <dig> into two groups: one corresponding to strains of human origin and the other, containing several related sts , corresponding to strains of animal origin only. a previous study analyzing  <dig> strains of s. agalactiae of human and animal origin by whole-genome dna-array hybridization also separated st- <dig> strains into two clusters, one associated with serotype iii and the other with serotype ia  <cit> . each of these two clusters was associated with a particular pattern of surface protein expression. this previous study also separated the bovine and human cc <dig> strains  <cit> . these results are consistent with an ancient divergence of these clusters, whereas other observations based on mlst analysis suggest that st- <dig> strains may have arisen from a bovine ancestor  <cit> . the lack of a strict correlation between the results of mlst and mlva may be accounted for by differences in the markers used for mlst  and mlva . unlike mlst, mlva targets several types of markers: genes involved in metabolism, genes associated with virulence and a genomic island. indeed, sag <dig> is located upstream from the gene encoding the ribosomal protein s <dig> which is involved in transcription and translation, and sag <dig> is located within dnaj, which encodes a member of the hsp <dig> family, a co-chaperone protein . the sag <dig> locus encodes a surface protein involved in virulence, fbsa. the sag <dig> locus is located on a genomic island and belongs to a gene encoding a hypothetical protein whose function has not yet been identified, like most of the genes of genomic islands  <cit> . clustering based on mlva data was almost identical with the upgma and mst algorithms except for cluster  <dig>  the differences in mathematical calculation between the two methods may account for the observed differences in strain clustering. this phenomenom has been previously observed in mlva studies  <cit> .

some vntrs for the alpha c protein have already been described in s. agalactiae  <cit> . one of these vntrs is involved in regulating gene expression: a pentanucleotide repeat located upstream from the promoter regulates expression in vitro by phase variation. another is an intragenic vntr that modifies the size of the alpha c protein, thereby altering its antigenicity and strain virulence  <cit> . these two vntr loci were not included in the mlva method proposed here, in one case because the small size of the repeat unit  complicates the mode of pcr fragment size assessment  <cit> . the amplicons of the second vntr locus not included were more than  <dig> bp in size, again making it difficult to evaluate repeat number. tandem repeats were also found in the gene encoding another surface protein, fbsa, which interacts with epithelial cells and is involved in invasion of the central nervous system of colonized neonates. its ability to bind to fibrinogen depends on the number of repeats of a unit of  <dig> amino acids present at its n-terminus  <cit> . a particular number of repeats is associated with the greater potential of the st- <dig> strains implicated in neonatal meningitis to adhere to fibrinogen  <cit> . this major marker was included in our mlva method and corresponds to sag <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the mlva method proposed here is a simple genotyping method producing results that can be exchanged between laboratories. mlva generated major clusters that corresponded well to the main clonal complexes obtained by mlst. however its discriminatory power provided was greater that that of mlst. mlva could also therefore be used as an epidemiological tool, given its high discriminatory power, making it possible to distinguish between strains of homogenous lineages. the specificities of the vntrs for each phylogenetic lineage raise questions about the role of vntrs in the adaptation of s. agalactiae to its environment and in virulence. further studies are required to clarify these issues.
