BACKGROUND
acquisition of somatic genetic alterations plays an important role in the development of cancer. several systematic efforts have addressed the study of genetic alterations to characterize human cancers  <cit> , including: copy-number alterations , translocations, insertions or single-nucleotide polymorphisms . most of these approaches are focused on finding frequent alterations, which occur in a high number of cases. according to the selective pressure theory, a genomic alteration that confers an advantage to a malignant state is likely to be found in more tumors than expected by chance  <cit> . however, most methods that look for recurrent aberrations using copy number information find many regions, containing many genes  <cit> . therefore, to identify recurrently altered genomic regions -biologically relevant- it is necessary to integrate gene and genome information, as proposed by akavia et al.  <cit> . several reports have recently shown that integrative strategies can be very useful to identify driver genes, considering the hypothesis that disease-associated gene expression changes are frequently induced by genomic alterations  <cit> . most of these reports are focused on finding gene-based relationships.

built on these hypotheses -that relate transcriptomic and genomic alterations-, we propose a new integrative method based on the location of both types of signals along the genome. our method takes into account the genomic loci, both in the copy number  analysis and also in the gene expression  analysis, and applies the segmentation step proposed by ortiz-estevez et al.  <cit> . these authors designed a method for robust comparison between cn and ge using paired samples. such approach is based on a search for correlation between segmented cn regions and segmented ge regions to find the most significant simultaneous alterations. we follow this approach introducing two new steps to asses the matching between cn and ge loci:  first, a signal correlation analysis;  second, an alteration frequency analysis. using these analyses we propose a set of significantly altered genomic regions in the studied pathological state. in order to show the performance and demonstrate the value of our method, we use a dataset of  <dig> glioblastoma multiforme  samples with paired measurements of ge and cn .

RESULTS
the method is designed for combined analysis of datasets from two types of genome-wide arrays: dna genomic microarrays and rna expression microarrays. these arrays provide copy number and expression quantitative data, respectively. the analysis places both types of signals along the genome, taking into account the gene loci for the cn data and the ge data. the rationale of the method is to search for copy number alterations with a major influence in the expression levels of the genes encoded. as a distinctive element from other integrative approaches we do not consider only snps or genes individually. we take into account the gene loci following the strategy described in  <cit> , that is based on the application of the same smoothing and segmentation algorithm to cn and ge in order to establish comparable regions. once we get the smoothed segments, we perform two independent analyses for each gene loci: a signal correlation analysis and an alteration frequency analysis. .

analysis of correlation between gene expression and copy number levels
the method matches the cn and ge segmented signals within each chromosomal region -i.e., the log <dig> ratio signals of the corresponding segments- and selects the gene loci that show a significant correlation. these loci can be considered candidate hotspots. in figure  <dig> we present the results of this analysis done for the gbm dataset, marking in purple the number of gene loci with pearson correlation coefficient r ≥  <dig>  . such cutoff  includes around  <dig> % of the human gene loci, providing a good coverage with a significant p-value. setting more stringent cutoffs reduces the coverage too much: r ≥  <dig>  includes only ~ <dig> % of the gene loci; r ≥  <dig>  includes only ~ <dig> %.

the number of probes in the snp arrays -used to calculate the segmented signals for cn- is large and uniform along the genome. however, in the expression arrays some genomic regions do not have enough allocated gene loci and the number of probes is sparse. this fact is a problem when a ge segment includes outliers . to solve this problem, we look for statistically significant outliers within the ge segments -which were at least in 1/ <dig> of the samples- and we recalculate the signal correlation between their unsegmented ge and the corresponding cn segments. in this way, we find a new set of gene loci with correlation r ≥  <dig> , which is added to the initial set of candidate hotspots identified. this step of the procedure is important to recover some gene loci with quite significant correlation , which were missed in the first step due to the described problem.

analysis of frequencies for the categorical states up-gain and down-loss
the method also proposes to find the genomic regions that present a significant ge and cn alteration in the same direction. to assess this, we included a second selective step based on stratification of the segmented data. the genomic regions are stratified in several categories: up-regulation , down-regulation  or no-change  for expression; and gain , loss  or no-change  for copy number. this approach allows a discretization of the genomic regions into  <dig> different categories as shown in figure  <dig> : u-g, n-g, d-g, u-n, n-n, d-n, u-l, n-l, d-l. figure  <dig> also presents the empirical cumulative distributions for these  <dig> categories of the gbm samples per gene loci, counting the frequency of samples for all the gene loci in each category. as expected, the distributions show that the "no change"  is the most frequent state. the analysis of distributions also finds some regions that show a clear correspondence between ge and cn alterations: i.e. the scenario where ge up-regulation is observed co-located with a cn gain  and the scenario where ge down-regulation is co-located with a cn loss . our interest focuses on these regions, since they are the ones altered in the same way in both types of data. the analysis of the empirical frequency distributions for the u-g and d-l categories allows identifying the frequency cutoffs that correspond to the 10% upper quantiles. these cutoffs were:  <dig> samples for u-g and  <dig> samples for d-l . the set up of these thresholds identifies those genomic regions that are the most frequently assigned to such altered categories  in the studied dataset.

genome-wide identification of hotspots: candidate key genomic regions
our method identifies candidate key regions that show high correlation between cn and ge and that are frequently altered in the same direction, in both types of signals. the overlapping between the regions with the most significant correlation and the ones with the highest frequencies of simultaneous alteration  along the genome, will constitute hotspots where putative driver genes are likely to be encoded.

key genomic regions found for the  <dig> paired gbm cancer samples
as shown in figure  <dig>  the method presented in this work allows the identification of relevant altered genomic regions suffering significant changes in most of the gbm samples. the results also show that many of the detected cn alterations and ge changes overlap along the genome. these regions can be proposed as relevant "hotspots". in table  <dig> and table  <dig> we present a detailed description of the common genomic regions found in gbm; indicating the correlation and frequency of the u-g regions , and the d-l regions . the tables include the correlation between ge and cn for each region ; and the percentage of samples -frequency- in each region, counting only the samples where simultaneous ge and cn alterations occur: either up gene expression and gain in copy number  or down gene expression and loss in copy number . the regions detected are in the chromosomes that suffer the most significant changes in gbm samples: u-g, chr  <dig> and chr 20; d-l chr  <dig>  chr  <dig>  chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  the tables also include the genes enclosed in these regions. the most remarkable changes correspond to a large part of chr  <dig>  and to a large part of chr  <dig> . two important genes are precisely located in these chromosomes: egfr  usually up-regulated and pten  usually down-regulated  <cit> . pten is not found in our analysis, but it has been reported an absence of pten alterations in more than half of de novo glioblastomas and more than  <dig> % of glioblastomas developed from a pre-existing lower grade gliomas  <cit> , which has been linked to the presence of additional tumor suppressor genes on chr  <dig>  such as lgi <dig>  <cit>  and mxi <dig>  <cit> . we found these two genes in regions  <dig> and  <dig> of the d-l list , and we observed a very variable profile of pten in the gbm samples. these facts may indicate that pten is not the best genomic marker for this altered region. by contrast, we found rb <dig> tumor suppressor in region  <dig> of the d-l list; and this gene -included in chr 13- is a clear candidate to drive the alteration of tumor cells. with respect to egfr, it has the highest u-g frequency observed  and therefore the method reveals this gene locus as the most common ge up-regulated and cn gained in the gbm samples. the alteration of egfr can be associated with other genes that regulate its function, also found by the method. this is the case of vopp <dig> and rab11fip <dig>  vopp <dig> is also known as ecop  or gasp , and is found in region  <dig> of the u-g list . rab11fip <dig> is a suppressor of the endocytic internalization of egfr and it is found in region  <dig> of the d-l list   <cit> . the presence of these genes in the hotspots found for gbm supports the value of the method described. there are many other interesting genes in the identified altered genomic regions, that can be useful for further investigations on the disease studied.

CONCLUSIONS
the combined analysis of cn and ge data obtained using dna genome and rna expression microarrays for paired samples is a very powerful approach to uncover key altered regions in a biological state studied. we present a robust method to find genomic regions that show simultaneous significant changes in both cn and ge. our calculations applied to a cancer dataset find expected known genomic alterations and many others identified as key altered genomic regions. this approach is also proposed as an adequate strategy to identify driver or causal genes under the hypothesis that disease-associated gene expression changes are frequently induced by genomic alterations.

materials and methods
data
in this study we use a dataset of  <dig> human samples from glioblastoma multiforme   <cit>  that includes for each sample: affymetrix dna microarrays applied to detect of genome-wide cn changes and affymetrix rna expression microarrays applied to detect of ge changes. we used the same subgroup of samples that was previously analysed in ortiz-estevez et al.  <cit> .

ge and cn normalization and signals calculation
ge data were processed using rma algorithm  <cit>  applied to the human gene expression microarrays: affymetrix hgu <dig> plus  <dig>  . crmav <dig> algorithm  <cit>  was applied to normalize the raw data and obtain the signals from the affymetrix human mapping 500k snp arrays. the processed signals were divided by the median of the normal samples for each element  and then the log <dig> was computed. these log <dig> ratio signals were smoothed and segmented using circular binary segmentation  algorithm  <cit>  with the default parameters implemented in the dnacopy r package.

correlation between ge and cn
pearson correlation coefficients  of the segmented ge and cn data were calculated taking the values of the segmented copy number and gene expression at the central point of the genomic position for each gene. p-values for the correlation coefficient of every gene loci were computed and adjusted by bonferroni method. the established threshold for the selection of significantly correlated gene loci was correlation coefficient r ≥  <dig> , which corresponds to adjusted p-value <  <dig> . when using the gene loci ge unsegmented signal, the same correlation threshold and p-value cutoff were applied.

frequency of u-g and d-l alterations
the thresholds that define dna copy number gains and losses and up and down gene regulation were established applying k-means algorithm, fixing three clusters  on the segmented data, and done independently for the cn data and for the ge data. the cn data values were classified into gained , lost  or no-change  and the ge values were classified as up-regulated , down-regulated  or no-change . the thresholds found by k-means for cn in the gbm dataset were >  <dig>   for gain and < - <dig>  for loss. the thresholds found for ge in the gbm were >  <dig>   for up-regulation and < - <dig>  for down-regulation. a contingency table with the  <dig> possible categorical states for the two types of data was built for every gene locus. a cutoff threshold was set up for the frequency of up-regulated and gained  and for the down-regulated and lost  categories, based on the empirical cumulative distributions of the categories. taking into account the gene loci, the significant altered regions were defined as the ones that had a frequency ≥ than the upper 10% quantile of the distribution of u-g or the distribution of d-l.

general workflow for identification of key regions in the genome
following the steps described above, we present a general workflow  that illustrates the strategy to achieve a combined paired analysis of datasets from genome-wide microarrays, both for ge and cn. the workflow includes the different steps, the applied methods and the progression of the analysis. the strategy designed searches for high correlation between chromosomal regions that present a significant cn alteration  and regions with significant ge change . in this way, it determines which cn alterations have a strong influence on ge patterns. key regions, i.e. hotspots in the genome, are defined as those regions simultaneously chosen as significantly correlated and frequently altered in both ge and cn.
