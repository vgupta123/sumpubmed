BACKGROUND
modern rice  originated in southern china and, accompanying human migration, was expanded to a wide range of geographical regions  <cit>  diverging into indica, japonica and aus types. these genetic groups are characterized by specific climate adaptation, according to the agroecological conditions where they were cultivated. the indica genotypes are grown in tropical climates whereas japonica genotypes, as they suffered a wider expansion, can be found either in tropical or temperate climates. the adaptation process to new climate conditions involved changes in the genome that conferred advantages against adversity and, hence, selected and transmitted through generations. reaching northern limits of its natural cultivation area, japonica rice was progressively adapting to short growing seasons. in these new areas, flowering under long days  allowed cultivation in summer thus avoiding cold winter temperatures. genes involved in flowering regulation should show allelic differentiation across environmental gradients and the frequency in the allele pool present in different geographical regions may reflect the mechanism of adaptation of plants to new conditions of day length.

the regulation of flowering is a fine tuned mechanism that changed as part of the adaptation process to new climate conditions. two independent photoperiod pathways, involving the floral regulators heading date  <dig>  and early heading date  <dig> , have been implicated in flowering date. these pathways converge through modulation of the expression of heading date 3a  or rice flowering locus t <dig> , the genes that encode florigen, a mobile signal that moves from the leaves to the apical meristem to switch on the flowering process  <cit> . hd <dig> is predominantly regulated by the circadian clock through osgigantea , a key gene that positively controls hd <dig> expression  <cit> . hd <dig> is a zinc finger type transcriptional activator with a conserved cct-domain that acts as a crucial nuclear localization signal for the correct protein function  <cit> . it has been proposed that the presence of light-active phytochromes could modify hd <dig> activity to inhibit hd3a transcription  <cit> . under sd conditions, hd <dig> activates hd3a transcription thereby promoting flowering, whereas under non-inductive ld conditions hd <dig> acts as a repressor  <cit> . this claim is supported by the fact that loss-of-function hd <dig> mutants display early and late heading dates when grown under ld and sd conditions, respectively  <cit> . hd <dig> protein can also be modified in the presence of heading date  <dig> protein  suppressing hd3a expression, but only when hd <dig> is functional  <cit> . hd <dig> shows casein kinase activity, but there is evidence that hd <dig> does not phosphorylate directly hd <dig> suggesting the action of an additional factor. ehd <dig> is unique to the flowering pathway in rice and codes for a b-type response regulator that, in an hd1-independent manner, induces flowering under both sd and ld conditions  <cit> . expression analysis using transgenic plants over-expressing ehd <dig> indicate that ehd <dig> activates transcription of hd3a in rice, as well as other additional rice orthologs of arabidopsis ft genes  <cit> . ehd <dig> is thought to be a signal integrator of floral transition as multiple regulatory pathways convey through ehd <dig> to regulate hd3a or rft <dig> expression. in part, osgi, the circadian clock mediator, regulates ehd <dig> expression under sd conditions via osmads <dig> <cit> . osmad <dig>  another mads box gene, is a positive regulator of ehd <dig> expression, and it works either parallel with or downstream of osgi <cit> . ghd8/dth <dig>  was identified as a major qtl with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date and plant height. this qtl appears to delay flowering under ld conditions, and promote it in the opposite conditions. moreover, ghd8/dth <dig> also represses the expression of ehd <dig> and hd3a under ld conditions, but it is not clear if the qtl acts directly on hd3a or down-regulates ehd <dig> <cit> . it is also known that oryza sativa lec <dig> and fusca-like  <dig>  and ghd <dig> delays flowering under ld conditions, most likely repressing ehd <dig> <cit> . in a different pathway, ehd2/osid <dig> up-regulates ehd <dig> expression under both sd and ld conditions  <cit> . early heading date  <dig>  protein is localized in the nucleus and has acid-binding and transcriptional activation properties. furthermore, ehd <dig> promotes flowering increasing ehd <dig> expression  <cit> . on the other hand, phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both hd <dig> and ehd <dig> regulation. photoperiod sensitivity <dig> , for example, that encodes a heme oxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of the chromophore part of phytochrome, represses ehd <dig> expression and therefore acts as a floral repressor  <cit> .

it has been shown that the expression pattern of hd <dig> is clearly distinct from that of ehd <dig>  hd <dig>  which functions as a circadian clock mediator, shows similar patterns of expression under both sd and ld conditions whereas ehd <dig> is mainly induced under sd conditions  <cit> . these observations imply that, in rice, hd <dig> and ehd <dig> are antagonistic under ld, but are synergistic under sd. hd <dig>  depending upon phytochrome abundance, promotes flowering under sd and inhibits flowering under ld, whereas ehd <dig> promotes flowering under both conditions  <cit> . it has been suggested that the equilibrium between the influence of both pathways that converge on hd <dig> and ehd <dig> results in hd3a modulation and, consequently, in the regulation of floral transition under sd conditions  <cit> .

hd3a is a member of the ft-like family and shares 91% of identity with rft <dig>  the closest homologue. although there is evidence that ft-l1/ftl is possibly involved in flowering  <cit> , hd3a and rft <dig> are considered to be the major contributors of the ft-like members to floral promotion since suppression of both hd3a and rft <dig> expression results in no flowering  <cit> . although it has been demonstrated that rft <dig> can certainly activate flowering in the absence of hd3a expression under sd conditions, a secondary role however has been given to rft <dig> in floral promotion under sd conditions  <cit> . on the other side, rft <dig> seems to be a major floral activator under ld conditions as evidenced by rnai studies where expression of either hd3a, rft <dig> or both was suppressed  <cit> . in addition, this is supported by the fact that sdg <dig>  a rice histone methyltransferase gene, that is required for flowering under ld conditions modulates positively ehd <dig> and rft <dig> expression, but not hd3a <cit> . despite all these major factors involved in the flowering regulation, some other factors affecting florigen regulation should be considered. recently, days to heading on chromosome  <dig> , a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under ld conditions has been cloned. dth <dig> encodes a constant-like protein that promotes flowering by inducing hd3a and rft <dig> independently of hd <dig> and ehd <dig> <cit> .

diversification of flowering time was one of the major reasons for rice expansion. selection of favorable alleles during the domestication and breeding process lead to the generation of new varieties adapted to different climate conditions. in this regard, the identification and characterization of allele diversity in rice populations, offers information of relevance on the mechanism of adaptation of these plants. studies on variation of flowering regulatory genes have previously been performed on the three pivotal genetic factors contributing to flowering time in rice under sd: the promoter type of hd3a, the functionality of hd <dig> and the expression level of ehd <dig> <cit> . these studies indicated that changes in flowering time are probably not dependent on the intrinsic features of the florigens, but rather on their regulation. hd3a protein function has been shown to be highly conserved among rice cultivars since no functional changes were found in hd3a in either cultivated or ancestral rice. additionally, hd3a expression level showed a strong correlation with flowering time under sd conditions  <cit> , suggesting that differences in the hd3a promoter type, rather than protein variation, directly affects the variation in hd3a expression levels. similarly to hd3a, ehd <dig> also encodes a highly conserved protein in cultivated rice. although full evidence is still lacking, there are indications that variations in genes functioning upstream of ehd <dig> in the regulatory pathway, such as ghd <dig> or mads <dig>  could potentially provide variations in ehd <dig> expression  <cit> . in contrast, a high degree of polymorphism has been found in hd <dig>  that possesses several non-functional alleles. loss-of function alleles of hd <dig> are common in cultivated rice and it has been suggested that they cause flowering time diversity  <cit> . analysis of variation of hd <dig> in modern and ancient cultivars indicated that multiple introgression events in certain alleles of hd <dig>  including non-functional alleles, played a role in adaptation to specific areas at the beginning of domestication  <cit> .

despite all the information available, most of variation analyses of flowering regulatory genes have been performed with indica rice while little is known on the diversity in japonica varieties adapted to ld conditions. additionally, the characterization of the allele pool could reveal information about the role of rft <dig> on induction of flowering in northern latitudes. to better understand the mechanism of flowering of japonica rice, cultivated in northern latitudes adapted to ld conditions, in this study we analyzed the allele distribution and the expression of the master genes, rft <dig> and hd3a, and their immediately regulators, hd <dig>  ehd <dig> and dth <dig> 

RESULTS
cycle length of japonica cultivars
to analyze the genetic pool related to flowering control in japonica rice adapted to ld conditions, a core collection of  <dig> selected cultivars was used. the collection included japonica type cultivars from different geographical origins, mainly from northern latitudes, and two indica cultivars, as control. cultivars were representative of all genetic groups found across northern latitudes according to recent population structure analysis  <cit> . plants grown under natural ld conditions during summer were able to reach the reproductive stage and to produce panicles, except kinmaze plants. plants flowered ranging from 73 days to 168 days after sowing and had an average panicle emergence of 115 days after sowing .

expression analysis of rft <dig> and hd3a
to study the role of rft <dig> and hd3a in the induction of flowering in japonica cultivars under ld conditions, we searched for possible relationships between their expression levels and flowering times by performing an expression analysis in 11 weeks old plants of our core collection. expression levels of both rft <dig> and hd3a were variable among cultivars. mrna levels of rft <dig> were most closely correlated with flowering time, indicating that higher expression levels were associated with earlier flowering time  . hd3a mrna levels showed little correlation with flowering time of the different cultivars  , suggesting that hd3a expression has lower effect on flowering regulation of japonica rice cultivated under ld conditions. therefore, rft <dig> seems to contribute as the main factor in the regulation of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase under ld conditions among japonica cultivars while hd3a, also expressed, participates with a minor role. these data are consistent with previous results showing that rft <dig> is a major floral activator in rice grown under ld conditions  <cit> .

nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of rft <dig> and hd3a
we investigated the occurrence of nucleotide polymorphisms in the rft <dig> promoter region including the 5’-untraslated region  and found a high degree of conservation . one major allele was shared by all cultivars in the core collection, except by two of them. one of the alleles differed only in a single nucleotide deletion. kasalath, included in the core collection as a control, contained a third allele showing differences in the promoter region, including the utr, consisting in single nucleotide substitutions, a deletion of 11 bp and a insertion of 22 bp. despite variations in rft <dig> promoter in kasalath, the expression levels of rft <dig> followed the tendency observed in other cultivars and did not appear to affect expression . as little is known about variability of the coding region of rft <dig>  we further investigated this region. we detected the presence of a unique allele among all japonica cultivars. again, kasalath showed differences that, in this case, implicated two amino acid changes in the encoded protein .

previous studies found little variability in the protein encoded by hd3a and variations found in the coding region did not affect the functional domains of the protein  <cit> . to investigate the diversity in the promoter region of hd3a in japonica cultivars, we analyzed in the core collection over 2-kb region of hd3a including the promoter and the 5_ utr region by ecotilling. nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed that hd3a was also highly conserved among japonica cultivars . all cultivars included in this study shared the same hd3a promoter sequence with the exception of three that contained two different alleles. as rft1allele, kasalath contained a different hd3a allele to the rest of the core collection . variations identified in the hd3a promoter consisted of single nucleotide substitutions, small deletions and a  <dig> bp insertion. no major alterations in potential regulatory sequences of the hd3a promoter were identified. within the analyzed promoter fragment, no changes affected the ccaat box or the three binding sites recognizing the garp dna-binding domain of ehd <dig> that potentially can bind the hd3a promoter via the arr <dig> binding element  <cit> . the variability found in hd3a promoter among the analyzed cultivars was lower than in previous studies using indica cultivars  <cit> .

nucleotide polymorphism in ehd <dig>  hd <dig> and dth2
in a search for nucleotide polymorphisms that may cause differences in ehd <dig> expression, we analyzed 1 kb of ehd <dig> promoter region by ecotilling. we identified  <dig> types of sequences among japonica cultivars ; although only two of them were present predominantly. type a was shared by  <dig> cultivars while type b was found in  <dig> cultivars, and both types were widely distributed along all continents . type c was exclusively present in four cultivars; two of them were indica type and a third had indica ancestors suggesting that allele c is characteristic of indica rice. differences between the three types of alleles consisted of single nucleotide substitutions or insertions. expression analyses showed that ehd <dig> mrna levels varied among cultivars and showed moderate correlation with the length of cycle  , indicating that other factors than ehd <dig> were regulating flowering promotion under ld conditions. additionally, despite the extent of variation, allele type a tended to show higher expression levels than allele b or c as shown in figure 4b and c, indicating the possibility of association between promoter type and expression level.

to look for changes in hd <dig> that may alter the capacity of function of the protein, we analyzed polymorphisms in hd <dig> coding sequence among the core collection and we found a high degree of variation, leading to the identification of  <dig> different alleles . almost half of the analyzed cultivars,  <dig> out of  <dig> cultivars, contained hd <dig> variants that are likely to contain non-functional alleles of hd <dig>  most of the loss of function was due to deletions that caused frame-shift mutations or changes in one nucleotide that created premature stop codons. additionally, a three base pair deletion localized within the cct-domain of the protein that acts as a nuclear localization signal was present in ten cultivars. in these varieties, the correct function of hd <dig> could be affected  <cit> . other variants affecting other regions of the protein could also cause changes in the protein activity. this is the case of a deletion of  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus of the zinc finger domain in allele  <dig>  that may cause deregulation in hd <dig> binding capacity or alterations in the protein recognition capacity. c81y substitution, in alleles  <dig> and  <dig>  also affects the zinc finger domain. on the other hand, r83q and h106y changes have been reported previously, but no effect on the hd <dig> function was detected  <cit> . hd <dig> alleles were distributed randomly throughout all geographical regions , regardless of whether they carry functional or nonfunctional hd <dig> alleles.

to determine whether variations in the flowering time of japonica cultivars grown under ld conditions were correlated with the allelic diversity of hd <dig>  we grouped all the cultivars into those with functional and non-functional hd <dig> alleles and compared their rft <dig> and hd3a mrna levels with flowering times . no correlation could be found  neither between rft <dig> or hd3a mrna levels in cultivars, carrying functional or non-functional hd <dig> alleles, and flowering time. high or low levels or mrna were found in cultivars independently of the functionality of the displayed hd <dig> allele. these results suggested a minor influence of hd <dig> on rft <dig> and hd3a regulation in flowering induction among the analyzed cultivars grown under ld conditions. this irrelevant role of hd <dig> would be in accordance with the presence of a high number of hd <dig> variants compared to rft <dig>  hd3a and ehd <dig>  the other genes implicated in flowering pathway regulation. this is reinforced by the fact that there was no significant difference in flowering time between cultivars displaying functional or non-functional hd <dig> alleles, .

to investigate diversity in the dth <dig> that may cause differences in flowering time among the core collection, we examined dth <dig> coding region and we found variations in four nucleotides. type a was present in  <dig> cultivars . type b <dig> and b <dig> differed in a synonymous snp at position  <dig>  and, thus, they were grouped as type b, and was found in  <dig> cultivars. type c was present only in one cultivar and contained a snp that implicated an amino acid substitution  that affected the zinc finger domain at the n-terminal region of the protein  <cit> . we analyzed flowering time of japonica cultivars grown under ld conditions carrying dth <dig> type a or type b alleles and found no significant differences  in flowering time between both groups of cultivars .

discussion
rice is considered a short day plant, as its optimal flowering conditions are given under short day photoperiod. rice was domesticated in two independent events in two locations in china, in a tropical region, and then it was extended to the rest of the world  <cit> . the spread of rice to a wide range of geographical areas encompassed adaptation to habitats with different climates that included large differences in photoperiod. the transition of rice from vegetative to reproductive stage under sd conditions is dictated by hd3a, the master gene that codes for one of the mobile signal of flowering  <cit> . hd <dig> and ehd <dig> are the main regulators of hd3a expression, acting in an independent manner. ehd <dig> is a positive regulator of flowering while hd <dig> protein acts as a negative regulator under ld conditions. thus, the balance between ehd <dig> and hd <dig> function dictates flowering transition through hd3a induction. the adaptation of rice to ld conditions has drawn an alternative regulatory pathway to avoid inhibition exerted by hd <dig>  one possibility is that an alternative gene, other than hd3a, orchestrates the phase transition under ld condition. rft <dig> has been pointed as the major floral activator under ld conditions  <cit> . rft <dig> is a member of the ft-like family and shares 91% of identity with hd3a, the closest homologue. suppression of both hd3a and rft <dig> resulted in no flowering in plants grown under sd conditions, indicating that hd3a and rft <dig> are the major floral activators in rice under sd conditions  <cit> . according to current indications, it is believed that hd3a, but not rft <dig>  is the pivotal factor promoting floral transition under sd while, rft <dig> would play a secondary role in these conditions  <cit> . in our core collection rft <dig> expression showed higher correlation than hd3a with days to flowering in plants grown under ld conditions. these data support the hypothesis that rft <dig> is the major contributor to flowering under ld conditions in japonica cultivars. additionally, the possibility that the expression of both rft <dig> and hd3a affects each other has been investigated, but there is evidence that neither hd3a mrna nor hd3a protein acts directly on the rft <dig> promoter  <cit> . there are common regulation factors recognizing dna binding sites present in both promoter regions, as arr <dig> or caat-box containing factors. in that sense, it is known that ehd <dig> regulates positively both hd3a and rft <dig> <cit> , and it explains that hd3a is expressed under ld condition in the absence of hd <dig> inhibition. it has been described that sdg <dig> action specifically affects dna methylation and differential h3k36me2/ <dig> deposition levels at the rft <dig> locus but not at the hd3a locus  <cit> . chromatin modification by sdg <dig> also induces expression of ehd <dig>  via mads <dig>  independently of rft <dig> <cit> . sdg <dig> could be a common factor of regulation of both hd3a and rft <dig>  acting in an indirect manner by inducing the expression of ehd <dig> and also in a direct manner on rft <dig> 

dth <dig> modulates hd3a and rft <dig> expression independently of ehd <dig> and hd <dig>  although it represents a minor-effect quantitative trait locus it has been suggested that dth <dig> played an important role in adaptation to specific environments differing in day length  <cit> . distribution of dth <dig> alleles in cultivated rice in asia indicated that dth <dig> has been a target of artificial selection during domestication under ld conditions. we found a high degree of conservation of dth <dig> in our core collection. most of the cultivars analyzed in this study carried the same allele previously found in japonica cultivars grown in asia  <cit> , supporting this hypothesis. we also found a second allele in our core collection that contained a polymorphism that caused an amino acid substitution that did not affect the functional domains of the protein and we found no evidence that it may cause any differences in the flowering time.

as expected, rft <dig> and hd3a are well conserved among the core collection. in the japonica cultivars there is a major allele for each gene. it is thought that rft <dig> and hd3a were generated by gene duplication followed by divergence  <cit> . phylogenetic trees of ft-like genes showed that rft <dig> is unique to rice and that it diverged more rapidly than hd3a during rice evolution  <cit> . gene duplication usually generates functional redundancy and disruption by mutation of the function of one of both genes may lead to a pseudogene. therefore, two genes with identical functions are unlikely to be stably maintained in the genome, unless both duplicates differ in some aspects of their functions  <cit> . both rft <dig> and hd3a encode the florigen signal but it appears that they have different roles since their regulation differs according to day length. in that sense, the regulation of flowering time through rft <dig> regulation may be part of a mechanism of adaptation of plants to temperate climate conditions. functional hd <dig> gene is still present in japonica cultivars and it would explain the capacity to flower under sd conditions of most of the cultivars included in the core collection .

hd <dig> is a repressor of flowering under ld conditions through inhibiting hd3a expression. loss-of function alleles of hd <dig> are common in cultivated rice and it has been suggested that the lack of functionality of hd <dig> has been a target during domestication to diversify flowering times  <cit> . we have found  <dig> different alleles among  <dig> cultivars, almost half of them are non-functional due to small deletions that caused frame shift or early stop codons. the non-functional alleles were widely distributed across all continents and they were not clearly associated with any location in particular. similar results were found in previous studies that showed that loss-of function alleles represented more that 50% of the alleles found in japonica and indica cultivars and  <dig> % in aus cultivars  <cit> . the high number of hd <dig> alleles and the presence of non-functional alleles reflect the relaxation of pressure exerted on this gene, probably due to the lower implication of hd <dig> in flowering under ld conditions and the replacement of its influence by other regulating factors. furthermore, we have not found statistical differences between the presence of functional alleles and the time of flowering. in previous studies performed mainly with indica rice under sd conditions, cultivars with non-functional hd <dig> alleles showed significantly later flowering times than those with functional hd <dig> alleles  <cit> . however, in our core collection we did not observe any difference in flowering time among japonica cultivars that could be associated with the presence of a functional or non-functional hd <dig> allele. additionally, our results indicated that hd3a and rft <dig> expression levels are not affected by the type of hd <dig> allele present in each cultivar. this hypothesis appears to be reinforced if rft <dig> is considered the main regulator of floral transition. in such model, the influence of hd3a and rft <dig> in flowering is specific of day length conditions and hd3a becomes the major influential factor under sd conditions while rft <dig> plays this role under ld conditions. all together indicates that in the cultivars hd <dig> may not be a dominant element determining flowering transition through hd3a under ld. the predominant role of rft <dig> in flowering induction in plants adapted to ld would represent an advantage by avoiding the inhibitory action of hd <dig> and, thus relaxing the evolutionary pressure on this gene. in the absence of inhibition by hd <dig>  the activation of rft <dig> and hd3a would be exerted by the action of ehd <dig>  the flowering signal integrator, although other factors implicated in the regulation of rft <dig>  as chromatin modification by sdg <dig>  may also play controlling roles.

CONCLUSIONS
rice was domesticated in a region located in the tropics, from where it extended to other geographical areas reaching latitudes with temperate climate where photoperiod conditions were not favorable for flowering and, thus, for reproduction. to adapt to the new conditions, rice had to overcome or avoid the inhibition action of hd <dig> under ld length. in these circumstances, two alternatives may be adopted: the emergence of non-functional hd <dig> alleles that could inhibit flowering under ld conditions and the appearance of an alternative regulatory pathway governed by rft <dig>  the existence of non-functional hd <dig> alleles and the lack of correlation of hd3a expression levels with the flowering time of the cultivars adapted to ld conditions support the hypothesis that hd3a plays a minor role in the regulatory pathway in northern latitudes. additionally, our data suggested that rft <dig> could be the main factor in the regulation of flowering among japonica cultivars adapted to ld conditions. in the absence of inhibition exerted by hd <dig> through repression of hd3a, the influence of ehd <dig> in the regulation of rft <dig> and hd3a appeared reinforced. the data also indicated the occurrence of other regulatory factors controlling both master genes.
