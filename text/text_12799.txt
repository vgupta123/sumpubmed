BACKGROUND
gastrointestinal nematode  infection  is one of the main constraints to livestock production both in temperate and tropical countries. in many cases, gin parasitism can be attributed to a nutritional disease, because the presence of worms usually induces a decrease in appetite, a decreased digestibility of the food and a diversion of nutrients from production sites towards the repair of tissue-damage caused by the parasites. therefore, economic losses caused by gin are related to decreased production, treatment costs and even animal death.

control of these parasitic infections in ruminants relies almost exclusively on multiple and regular dosing with anthelmintics. besides the parasitological efficacy of an anthelmintic treatment, it is very important to consider its strategic and economic benefits. indeed, for producers the two primary aims of anthelmintic treatment strategies are firstly to maintain or improve animal performance and secondly to reduce pasture contamination  <cit> .

the beneficial impact of anthelmintic treatment on milk production have been extensively documented in dairy cows  <cit> ; however, very few studies have been conducted on this topic in dairy goats  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> .

the present field trial was aimed at comparing the anthelmintic efficacy and benefit of treatment with moxidectin  <dig> % , with that of ivermectin  <dig> %  - both used at the dose rates recommended by manufacturers - on milk production in a commercial dairy sheep farm in central italy, utilising animals naturally infected by gin.

RESULTS
necropsies
the necropsies performed  <dig> days before the beginning of the trial allowed us to identify the species of gin in the animals of the study farm. the adult nematodes recovered and identified in sheep were: teladorsagia circumcincta and haemonchus contortus in the abomasums, trichostrongylus vitrinus in the small intestine, and oesophagostomum venulosum in the large intestine.

faecal egg counts
the arithmetic mean  epg on day  <dig> was  <dig>  for the mox-group,  <dig>  for the ivm-group and  <dig>  for the c-group. the percentage reductions in faecal egg counts  in the mox-group, compared to the untreated c-group, were  <dig> % on day 7;  <dig> % on day  <dig>  =  <dig> - <dig> %); 100% on day 28;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ; and  <dig> % on day  <dig> .

thus, the treatment with moxidectin was highly effective  from day  <dig> until day  <dig>  and effective  until day  <dig> 

the fecr in the ivm-group, compared to the untreated c-group, was  <dig> % on day  <dig> ;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ;  <dig> % on day  <dig> ; and  <dig> % on day  <dig> .

thus, the treatment with ivermectin was highly effective  from day  <dig> until day  <dig>  effective  on day  <dig> and moderately effective  on day  <dig> 

it should be noted that the study animals were also infected by lungworms  with  <dig> larvae per gram of faeces  at day  <dig>  the efficacy of moxidectin against lungworms was 100% from day  <dig> until day  <dig> and then ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % until day  <dig>  the efficacy of ivermectin against lungworms was 100% at day  <dig>  98% at day  <dig> and then ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % until day  <dig> 

coprocultures
regarding the mox-group, faecal cultures performed at day  <dig> revealed the presence of the following genera : haemonchus , teladorsagia , trichostrongylus  and oesophagostomum . from day  <dig> to day  <dig> post treatment, only very few gin larvae were found and thus the genus percentage was not determined. larvae of haemonchus, teladorsagia, trichostrongylus and oesophagostomum were found in different percentages from day  <dig> to day  <dig> 

regarding the ivm-group, faecal cultures performed at day  <dig> revealed the presence of the following genera : haemonchus , teladorsagia , trichostrongylus  and oesophagostomum . from day  <dig> to day  <dig> post-treatment only very few gin larvae were found and thus the genus percentage was not determined. larvae of haemonchus, teladorsagia, trichostrongylus and oesophagostomum were found in different percentages from day  <dig> to day  <dig> 

regarding the c-group, faecal cultures performed at days  <dig> revealed the presence of the following genera : haemonchus , teladorsagia , trichostrongylus  and oesophagostomum . faecal cultures performed until the end of study confirmed the presence of the same  <dig> genera in different percentages.

milk production
the arithmetic means of fortnightly milk production for the treated groups  and control untreated group  were assessed. in the first  <dig> milk sampling dates, both mox-group and ivm-group showed milk productions significantly higher  than the milk production of the control group. overall, the mean milk productions of the treated groups were significantly  higher than those of the control group as follows:  <dig>  ml versus  <dig>  ml  for mox-group, and  <dig>  ml versus  <dig>  ml  for ivm-group. if considered until day  <dig>  mean milk production was as follows:  <dig>  ml versus  <dig>  ml  for mox-group,  <dig>  ml versus  <dig>  ml  for ivm-group.

discussion
the results of the present trial demonstrated that moxidectin and ivermectin adminstered per os according to the manufacturer's instructions  were both effective and safe anthelmintics in sheep.

as expected, moxidectin showed a longer persistence of anthelmintic action compared to ivermectin; this was probably due to the differences in potency, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic behaviour between the two drugs. indeed, moxidectin is much more lipophilic than ivermectin and is mainly stored in fat  <cit> . this appears to have an accumulatory effect and results in a long mean residence time for the drug in the body, as it has been widely demonstrated in cows  <cit> , in sheep  <cit> , in goats  <cit> , in horses  <cit>  and in water buffaloes  <cit> .

regarding the economic efficacy of the treatments, the findings of the present study showed a total milk production higher in the treated groups  than the control group. specifically, overall, animals treated with moxidectin had a milk production  <dig> % higher than control group; those animals treated with ivermectin had a milk production  <dig> % higher than control group.

these results are in general agreement with studies in dairy sheep  that have used lamb liveweights to provide an indirect measure of milk production, and have reported milk yield to be increased by 15% following anthelmintic treatment with moxidectin towards the end of the gestation. also, recent field trials conducted in southern italy showed that strategic prophylactic treatment regimes based on the use of moxidectin milk yield in naturally infected ewes by between  <dig> and 44%  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
effective chemical anthelmintics remain irreplaceable for worm control and their elimination is not practical on animal welfare and economic grounds. even if the effect of macrocyclic lactones on gin was demonstrated several years ago, in the era of anthelmintic resistance, it is still important that farmers and veterinarians are concerned with parasitological, strategic, production and economic benefits accruing from prophylactic anthelmintic treatments.
