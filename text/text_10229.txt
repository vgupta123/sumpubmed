BACKGROUND
when a library of transposon  integrations is created in a bacterial genome, some insertions are not recovered in the resulting pool of mutants, either because the insertion is in an essential gene or because the gene is required in the media used to grow the bacterium. this fact has been exploited extensively to identify genes under selection when growth conditions are changed
 <cit> .

another potential utility of such data, that is explored here, is to compare different strains, serovars, and species to reveal apparent orthologs that have very different levels of fitness in different strains. we perform the first experiments to quantitate this phenomenon in salmonella.

we used high-throughput sequencing to determine the location of tens of thousands of integration sites of a tn <dig> derivative in the genome of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain atcc  <dig>  and in salmonella enterica serovar typhi ty <dig>  after growth in rich media . our datasets were compared to each other and to a series of other published data on the fitness of mutations in salmonella  <cit>  and escherichia coli 
 <cit> , including a previously obtained transposon profile in a separate ty <dig> isolate, sty <dig>  which differs from sty <dig> by having mutations in htraaroc and arod  <cit> .

differences in the selective pressure on apparent orthologs in the related genomes  are of interest because they likely reflect differences in the systems that interact with these otherwise functionally similar genes or their products.

RESULTS
profiling of a library of transposon insertions in salmonella typhimurium and typhi
five independent transposon libraries were constructed in s. typhimurium atcc  <dig>  and two in s. typhi ty <dig> , using the ez-tn5 < kan-2 > promoter insertion kit  , and grown in luria broth . the genomic dna directly adjacent to each transposon was obtained using a procedure similar to that described in santiviago et al.  <cit>  and sequenced as described in additional file
 <dig> and in additional file
3: figure s <dig> 

we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> first-strand illumina sequencing reads of  <dig> bases in length. sequences were subsequently filtered to reveal those reads that contained a complete primer including each unique barcode, followed by two bases of transposon  beyond the primer. the remainder of the sequence was mapped to the genome to determine the transposon integration site.

each tn integration site was generally represented by multiple reads, and these reads usually varied in the length of the salmonella sequence due to the random dna shearing used in the sequencing protocol. to reduce bias due to preferential pcr of some fragments, duplicate identical shear events were removed. the remaining reads for each transposon integration site were used to determine the number of different “shear events” for that transposon. this filtering resulted in the mapping of  <dig>  and  <dig>  tn integration locations, with  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  unique shear events in stm <dig> and sty <dig>  respectively. the average density of integrations into the genome was one every  <dig> bases with an average of about  <dig> shear events per site in stm <dig>  and one every  <dig> bases with an average of about  <dig> shear events per site in sty <dig> 

a genome-wide survey of permitted transposon integrations
the transposon libraries used in these experiments were constructed and grown in rich media. those regions of the genome with rare or absent transposon integrations include regions that are essential or under strong selection in rich media. a sizeable subset of these regions should also be essential under all growth conditions. an example of a profile of transposon integrations is shown in figure
 <dig>  which displays a region in the stm <dig> genome that includes a known essential gene, pria , and a gene with an essential region, ftsn . regions that were essential in luria broth are identifiable in this plot as having no transposon integrations. near-essential regions have a lower than average number of integration sites, usually accompanied by a lower number of shear events.

our data also provide information on the orientation of each transposon, which can be informative. for example, in figure
 <dig>  at the beginning of cytr, adjacent to ftsn, the negative strand contains far more transposons; this is the strand in which the heavily expressed antibiotic resistance marker of the transposon is oriented away from ftsn, likely making these integrations less disruptive. many other examples of general selection and strand-specific selection are seen in additional file
4: figure s <dig>  which shows a plot of the frequency of transposon insertions across the entire stm <dig> genome. a dramatic example of strand-specific selection is seen in the ribosomal rna operons, for example at position  <dig>  in the genome . in this operon transposons are only permitted in the antisense strand, perhaps because truncated sense strand transcripts produced by the strong antibiotic resistance promoter in the transposon would disrupt ribosome assembly.

the transposon frequency analyses for all genes in stm <dig>  and sty <dig> are presented in additional file

essential genes in e. coli
between e. coli, s. typhimurium and s. typhi, over 60% of protein coding genes are syntenic and have over 95% amino acid sequence identity
 <cit> . there are  <dig> of the approximately  <dig>  genes in eco that have been reported to be essential in at least one of two comprehensive studies, the pec  database and the keio collection
 <cit>  . of these potentially essential genes,  <dig> genes are considered essential in both databases, and all  <dig> genes have syntenic homologs in stm <dig>  these genes are listed in additional file

a plating on an “aro mix” agar containing l-phe, l-trp, p-aminobenzoic acid and  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoic acid , six passages of growth in luria broth .

we ranked all salmonella genes based on their density of transposons and the total number of shear events, and set a threshold of the 15th percentile for “highly selected” genes. exactly  <dig> genes in stm <dig>   <dig> genes in sty <dig>  and  <dig> genes in sty <dig> met these criteria. only six of the  <dig> genes essential in eco were not among these highly selected genes in stm <dig> : three narrowly missed the threshold  and three had average amounts of transposon insertions  indicating that mutants were not under selection in lb in this isolate. two other genes did not meet the “selected” threshold in our sty <dig> assay  and one gene, fola, was not found to be selected in the published sty <dig> data
 <cit> .

visual inspection of additional file
4: figure s <dig> revealed that in three of the genes that are essential in eco but seemingly not essential in stm <dig>  part of the respective gene was, in fact, devoid of any transposon insertions: yejm, a putative hydrolase; ftsn, which encodes a cell division protein; and murb, a udp-n-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase. figure
 <dig> shows the ftsn gene as an example. these genes can apparently be disrupted in certain locations without losing their essential function. thus, because of the high density of transposon integration data, we were able to reveal those cases where only part of the gene is essential.

the fourth of the six cases, trps, encodes a tryptophanyl-trna synthetase. it may tolerate transposon insertions in stm <dig> and sty because of the presence of a distant paralog , which does not exist in eco. trps <dig> may substitute the trps function, although it is only 28% identical
 <cit> .

the fifth gene essential in eco and not under strong selection in stm <dig> is degs, a serine endoprotease. this gene was under strong selection in sty2
 <cit> . that strain  is an htra mutant, a paralog of degs  <cit> . in our sty <dig> data, transposon insertion into degs was somewhat diminished, but not enough to qualify the gene for the “selected” category, suggesting at least some effect of the lack of a functional htra in sty <dig>  however, in stm <dig> there is no evidence for any degree of transposon underrepresentation in degs, and it seems likely that another paralog, as yet undefined, can perform the proteolytic activity of degs in this strain, if needed.

finally, folk was somewhat underrepresented in transposon insertion frequency in stm <dig>  but not to a degree that warranted inclusion in the “selected” category.

there are three other genes that are essential in eco and stm <dig>  but seemed not strongly selected in our sty <dig> survey and/or sty <dig>  the fola gene, involved in folate biosynthesis, was strongly selected in stm <dig> and sty <dig> but did not show as much selection in sty <dig>  especially after six passages in lb. lastly, yrff and gpsa are two genes essential in eco that did not meet the “selected” threshold in our sty <dig> assay. both these genes were under strong selection in stm <dig> and in sty <dig> after six passages in lb, indicating that mutations cannot be maintained for many passages in this medium. the yrff  gene encodes an intracellular growth attenuator protein; and gpsa encodes a nadh-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. igaa has been described as essential in s. typhimurium unless there are additional mutations in the rcscdb system, because it acts as a repressor of this system
 <cit> . expression of igaa is positively regulated by lon and negatively modulated by hnr  through the transcriptional regulator rpos
 <cit> . s. typhi ty <dig> carries a defect in the rpos gene
 <cit> , which may explain the lesser degree of selection of igaa in sty.

genes that are not essential in e. coli but are under strong selection in typhimurium and typhi
the list of essential genes in eco is stringent, generally including the inability to obtain a viable deletion mutant in rich medium. in contrast, the measure available from transposon integrations in stm <dig> and sty reveals genes that were under strong selection, but not necessarily essential. a group of  <dig> such genes that are under selection in all salmonella  but not essential in eco were identified . this list included many of the genes that might be expected to be under selection, such as genes encoding parts of the ribosome and its accessory proteins, as well as some genes encoding replication components. however, there were at least  <dig> genes that still have an unknown or a poorly understood function . given the conservation of these genes between salmonella and e. coli, these are particularly interesting targets for future studies to determine their exact function.

the approximately  <dig> genes shared by stm <dig> and sty that have no synteny in eco  yielded only two strongly and consistently selected genes: stm14_ <dig> and stm14_ <dig>  which both encode putative cytoplasmic proteins. however, santiviago et al. reported successful knockout mutations in both of these genes in this same strain, so they are likely not essential
 <cit> . however, the genes may have an effect on growth, because mutants in these genes grow poorly in competitive assays .

genes under greater selection in typhimurium than in typhi
genes that were under stronger selection in stm <dig> than in sty when the transposon libraries were grown in lb are depicted in table
3a. the most dramatic difference was in hns, with an almost equal effect on the near adjacent gene hnr. whereas hns is essential in salmonella unless certain second site mutations are also present
 <cit> , no selection against insertion in this gene was found in sty in this study. the most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that s. typhi ty <dig> is known to contain a mutation in the rposgene
 <cit> . mutations in this gene permit second site mutations in hns to be viable
 <cit> , and hnr  is a response regulator which post-transcriptionally modulates rpos levels
 <cit> . interestingly, stpa, which encodes a 53% identical paralog of hns, also showed a greater tolerance for transposons in sty than in stm <dig>  unlike hns, viable hnr mutants can be obtained in s. typhimurium
 <cit> , even though this gene appears to be strongly selected in stm <dig>  hnr participates in rpos stability by acting as an adaptor for degradation by the clpxp protease
 <cit> . mutants in hnr show reduced growth rate because of an increased rpos stability, which increases transcription of genes involved in growth arrest and resistance to a variety of stresses
 <cit> . the selection against hnr mutations seen in stm <dig> might be due to the non-advantageous phenotype of slow cell division in these mutants when they are in competitive growth.

 <dig> for notes a, b, and c. ranks above the 20th percentile are shown in bold.

d knockout mutant has been created in stm
 <cit> .

e considered essential in sty2
 <cit> .

at least  <dig> additional genes appeared to be under strong selection in stm <dig> but not in either sty. this class includes, among others, the putrescine abc transporter potf; an excisionase; a cation transport regulator chab; the l,d-carboxypeptidase a ldca; the phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase purc; and cpxp, a periplasmic repressor of the envelope stress response pathway. viable mutants were obtained in this same typhimurium strain for six of these genes
 <cit>  . it is not yet known if the remaining  <dig> genes can be deleted but it is likely that most, if not all, are not essential.

genes under greater selection in typhi than in typhimurium
genes that were under greater selection in sty <dig> and sty <dig> compared to stm <dig> are listed in table
3b. among the  <dig> genes under consistent selection in sty <dig>  and our own sty <dig> data, but not in stm <dig>  were four genes that encode hypothetical proteins and the previously mentioned degs. other genes in this class include euta, involved in the ethanolamine utilization pathway, the dimethyladenosine transferase ksga and trec, a trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase. the gene hole is an interesting example that is more strongly selected in sty than in stm <dig>  this gene encodes the theta subunit of dna polymerase iii. the stm14_ <dig> protein encoded on the virulence plasmid in stm <dig>  which is not present in sty, is a paralog that may partially substitute for hole  <cit> .

pseudogenes
integrations in genes that are thought to be pseudogenes in sty and intact in stm <dig>  or vice versa, were inspected. of approximately  <dig> putative pseudogenes annotated in the s. typhimurium  <dig> genome, four showed strong selection in stm <dig> and are annotated as intact in s. typhi ty2: stm14_ <dig>  stm14_ <dig> l, stm14_ <dig>  and stm14_ <dig>  only one of them, stm14_ <dig>  has an ortholog in eco  and, interestingly, has been reported as essential in this species. in stm14_ <dig> and stm14_ <dig> l, levels of selection in stm <dig> were similar to the levels in both sty. in the other two cases, there was no selection in at least one of the two sty isolates.

of approximately  <dig> pseudogenes in s. typhi ty <dig>  four were strongly selected in at least one of the sty: eda, a keto-hydroxyglutarate-aldolase/keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase; asta, an arginine succinyltransferase; t <dig> , a putative glycosyltransferase involved in cell wall biogenesis; and t <dig> , a putative cytoplasmic protein. the eda gene is the only case showing a strong selection in both sty <dig> and sty <dig> 

in s. typhi ty <dig>  an rna-seq analysis of the transcriptome was recently published
 <cit>  and concluded that the vast majority of pseudogenes had low or undetected transcription. only nine pseudogenes showed high levels of transcription, none of which correspond to our four strongly selected pseudogenes. a region annotated as a pseudogene and showing strong selection in any environmental condition suggests that a function is encoded in this region, whether it is a partial protein or a regulatory region.

differences between transposon mutant libraries of two strains of typhi
in our study,  <dig>  transposon integration sites for sty <dig> were determined. in a previous work,  <dig>  insertion sites were identified in sty <dig>  over  <dig> genes showed a difference in fitness between these two strains. some of these differences may be attributable to the growth conditions used in the two studies. our sty <dig> data are from a single lb growth passage whereas the sty <dig> data were from l-agar supplemented with aromatic compounds as well as from six passages in lb. furthermore, sty <dig> is an attenuated strain, cvd908-htra  <cit> , which differs from sty <dig> in that it carries additional mutations in arocarod, and htra  <cit> . deletions in the aro genes, which encode enzymes involved in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway, render bacteria auxotrophic for the aromatic amino acids p-aminobenzoate  and  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate
 <cit> . these aro mutations also result in the inability to produce ubiquinone and menaquinone, leading to respiration defects
 <cit> , and in defects in some components of the cell envelope
 <cit> , unless aromatic precursors are added to the medium. htra is a serine protease involved in the degradation of aberrant periplasmic proteins. an htra mutant presents more susceptibility to oxidative stress than the wild type
 <cit> .

we found  <dig> transposons in htra and one each in aroc and arod in sty <dig>  the number of transposons in htra was close to the average random transposon insertion frequency  whereas aroc and arod showed selection in both sty <dig> and sty <dig>  the apparent selection of aroc and arod in sty <dig> is explained by the fact that these genes were knocked out in this strain, resulting in a much smaller gene remnant as transposon target area. the htra mutation may explain at least some differences between the two strains of sty, such as the selection of the periplasmic protein hlpa and the strong selection of dsba after six passages in lb in sty <dig>  but not in our sty <dig> study. in e. coli, the skp  degp  double mutant is lethal
 <cit>  and the dsba degp double mutant shows reduced growth
 <cit> .

sty <dig> showed selection in some salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  genes
 <cit> . some of these were also selected in stm <dig>  but not in sty <dig>  some other spi genes were interesting from a regulatory point of view. the hilc and rtsa spi- <dig> regulators were selected in sty <dig>  but not in sty2
 <cit> . rtsa is encoded in an operon that also includes the similarly selected rtsb, whose product represses the master regulator of the flagellar regulon, flhdc  <cit> .

flagellar genes
flagellar genes show different patterns of selection comparing growth in lb broth under aeration  versus on lb agar . flagella and motility are highly regulated in s. typhimurium and involve over  <dig> genes integrated in a hierarchy of controlled transcription
 <cit> . the flagellar structure consists of three components: the basal body, the hook and the filament. the basal body consists of three rings and a rod which transverses the periplasmic space. these three components are expressed coordinately, first the hook-basal body  and later the filament, and assembled via a flagellar type iii secretion apparatus
 <cit> . the flgm gene encoding the anti-sigma  <dig> negative regulator of the synthesis of the flagellar filament, was selected in broth media, but not on lb agar. flgm binds to the sigma  <dig> factor to prevent transcription of late flagellar genes before the completion of hbb structure
 <cit> . in contrast, flgcflgjfliiflik, and flio were selected only when bacteria were grown on an agar surface. flgc is one of the structural rod components and flgj is the capping protein of the rod which also possesses muramidase activity
 <cit> . flii is an atpase that forms part of the flagellar type iii export apparatus, although it is not essential
 <cit> . flik regulates the length of the hook by switching the secretion specificity from rod-hook type substrates to filament-type substrates
 <cit> . flio is one of the integral membrane proteins of the flagellar secretion system which seems to have a role in stabilizing another protein of this system, flip
 <cit> . these five proteins are components of the basal body or the flagellar export apparatus, or interact with these structures. furthermore, flit, which encodes a protein that acts as a repressor of flagella biosynthesis
 <cit> , was selected after six passages in lb in sty2
 <cit> . the flagellar gene flhe showed selection on agar growth and after six passages in lb in sty2
 <cit> . although it is known that the lack of flhe does not affect flagella biogenesis or swimming motility, these mutants are defective in swarming motility
 <cit> . in agreement with these results, wang et al. reported that flagellar genes were regulated in a surface-specific manner
 <cit> . overall, our data indicates selection for genes encoding inhibitors of flagellar biogenesis when bacteria are grown in lb broth, such as flgm and flit; and selection for genes necessary for flagellar biosynthesis when bacteria are grown on agar.

comparison of fitness data with previous efforts to identify essential genes in salmonella
we compared our data  to previous experiments that had sought to identify essential and non-essential genes in typhimurium . we previously reported  <dig>  genes that give viable mutants in rich media in the same strain of typhimurium as used here
 <cit> . at least  <dig> of these genes are “selected” in our study . the differences may be attributable to measuring essentiality, which is absolute, versus fitness selection, which is relative. in another study,  <dig> genes were identified as potentially essential genes for in vitro growth in lb using an insertion-duplication mutagenesis  strategy based on a temperature-sensitive integration plasmid
 <cit> . of these  <dig> genes, only  <dig> were under strong selection in stm <dig> in our data. it was previously suggested that some of these putative essential genes might be non-essential
 <cit> . it appears that idm may give a high rate of false positives for essential genes. in another study, a prediction using metabolic reconstruction identified  <dig> genes that could be essential for growth of s. typhimurium lt <dig> in lb, of which  <dig> were already known to be essential in e. coli  <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> potentially novel essential phenotypes,  <dig> were under strong selection in stm <dig>  additionally,  <dig> genes were predicted to be essential only in minimal media. six of these genes were under strong selection in rich media in stm <dig>  given the considerable discrepancy in the observed and predicted genes under selection, fitness data have the great potential to improve systems biology models in the future.

an extended motif for transposon integration
tn <dig> transposition can occur into almost any sequence. indeed, we were unable to find any bias in integration targeting when we used all the transposon integration data we had available and a variety of motif-finding programs , indicating that the vast bulk of integration sites were largely randomly distributed. however, hotspots, where tn <dig> integration is preferred, have been reported
 <cit> . goryshin et al. sequenced  <dig> integration sites in a plasmid and identified a short degenerate consensus palindromic motif where integrations were more frequent: a-gntywranc-t
 <cit> . the dash indicates the site of cleavage of the target that is then duplicated on either side of the transposon integration. to examine whether hotspots for integration in our data might further refine this motif we filtered over  <dig>  integration sites for those sites that occurred in more than one of our independent transposon libraries. then we filtered for integration sites represented by more than the average number of total shear events. this strategy yielded  <dig> sites that were among the most highly preferred targets for integration. by aligning the sequences surrounding these sites, we were able to refine the originally reported motif and further extend the motif by five bases on either side, including a highly conserved c and g located two and five bases upstream of the nick in the target dna: cgcgca-gttywraac-tgcgcg . the opportunity for preferred interactions along the length of this 21-base target motif might stabilize a transposase-dna pre-cleavage or cleavage complex for co-crystalization or other imaging studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified differences in the ability to tolerate transposon integrations between salmonella typhimurium strain  <dig> and two strains of s. typhi ty <dig>  we also found potential differences in essentiality of homologous genes between salmonella and e. coli .

sometimes, these differences in selection can be explained by the presence of an identifiable paralog, present in one genome but not another, which can take over some or all of the functions of the mutated gene. examples include trps and hole. in other cases, a difference in a function encoded elsewhere in the genome differentially impacts the role of orthologs. the best example of this phenomenon in the present study is hns which is essential in stm <dig> but not in either sty dataset. it is known that rpos mutants permit mutations in hns in salmonella in some circumstances
 <cit> , and sty <dig> and sty <dig> are rpos mutants
 <cit> . similarly, hnr also showed a profound selection only in stm <dig>  although this gene is not essential in salmonella, the presence of a functional copy of rpos may also be the reason for this selection, because hnr acts as a stability moderator for rpos
 <cit> .

for some genes, such as yejm, ftsn and murb, we identified orf segments that are essential whereas other regions of the gene can be freely interrupted by transposon insertions. likely, these non-essential orf regions exclude protein domains that are involved in critical functional modules of those genes.

our experiments here involve comparisons among three salmonella strains grown in rich media. however, the study of fitness profiles in hundreds of different strains in multiple growth conditions has the potential to reveal differences in life strategy not evident from the genome sequences alone and to contribute to understanding natural diversity. advances in dna sequencing and the ability to incorporate any number of different barcodes for comparison of multiple samples at the same time mean that comparative analysis of fitness among many different natural strains with different phenotypes has become practical. we speculate that as systems biology models become more refined, the fitness profiles of genomes may become useful for constraining these models.
