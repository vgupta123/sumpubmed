BACKGROUND
the interactions between intracellular pathogen and host can be complex involving sophisticated offensive and defensive strategies by both organisms. developing a systems level understanding of the virulence program of a pathogen, both in terms of the regulatory pathways and the virulence-related proteins that execute this program is important to effectively combat persistent and adapting pathogens  <cit> . combining high-throughput characterization of proteins and gene transcripts under multiple different conditions relevant to virulence provides a wealth of information that can be mined to provide useful leads for further investigation or used as the basis of predictive models.

salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen with a broad host range capable of infecting birds, reptiles, mice, humans and other mammals. in humans, it is a leading causative agent of gastroenteritis with significant impacts on childhood mortality in the developing world  <cit>  and among hiv positive patients in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . in susceptible mice, stm causes a lethal systemic infection. because its symptoms resemble human typhoid fever caused by the s. enterica serovar typhi, which only infects man, stm-mediated systemic infection in mice represents an established model system to investigate the pathogenesis and immunology of typhoid fever in humans  <cit> . stm is an intracellular pathogen that can replicate in a variety of cell types, but is most frequently found in monocytes and neutrophils following infection where it is located within a specialized host-membrane bound body, the salmonella-containing vacuole   <cit> . stm is able to avoid lysosomal fusion with the scv and thus evade destruction  <cit> .

during systemic infection a sophisticated regulatory network processes and integrates a variety of hostile environmental cues including acidic ph  <cit> , antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  and reactive oxygen species  <cit>  within macrophages triggering induction of specific subsets of genes to adapt to the growth environment, evade the innate immune response, and prevent lysosomal fusion. the coordinated action by this regulatory network involves tight regulation of numerous virulence-related factors including the salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig>  type iii secretion system   <cit>  and secreted proteins. spi- <dig>  located at  <dig> minutes on the chromosome, encodes the structural components of spi- <dig> t3ss as well as regulators and secretion effectors. spi- <dig> t3ss delivers a variety of effector proteins into host cells to manipulate host cellular activities. functions of spi- <dig> effector proteins are diverse, including blocking phago-lysosome fusion, subverting inflammatory response, and modulating motility of infected cells  <cit> .

the identification of genes that are required for stm virulence using high-throughput "omics" technologies is an area of considerable experimental investigation  <cit> . the general approach employed in most of these studies involves profiling stm mrna or protein abundances following infection of host cells or under infection-mimicking conditions versus standard laboratory conditions, with pathogen genes exhibiting higher mrna or protein abundance under infectious conditions identified as potential virulence factors. however a challenge with this approach is deconvoluting virulence-relevant and -irrelevant effects. omics methods applied to identify virulence factors frequently identify gene products related to cellular stresses and basal metabolism, which are common responses to growth in a hostile host environment but may not be directly involved in virulence. in order to weed out virulence-irrelevant responses, expression profiles of isogenic avirulent strains lacking essential virulence regulators  <cit>  were compared in parallel. when considered individually, any strain missing a virulence regulator may show alterations in a complex regulatory network that includes both virulence factors and genes necessary to respond to specific environmental conditions encountered by free living bacteria as well. therefore, evaluating commonly converging effects of multiple virulence regulators and in the context of the global regulatory network during infection or, at the very least, under conditions that mimic the host environment represents an attractive novel strategy for the identification of proteins that are required for stm virulence.

in this study, we exploited multiple omics datasets  across multiple regulatory deletions under selected environmental conditions to determine a co-expression network that contains information about regulatory interactions for the infectious environment, which necessitated integration of the omics-derived data utilizing computer-aided network analysis facilitated by the context likelihood of relatedness  algorithm  <cit> . using this approach we identified previously unrecognized virulence factors as well as well-characterized virulence factors that were co-regulated by essential virulence regulators in a coordinated manner. excitingly, the novel virulence proteins discovered through this approach were categorized into a new class of virulence effectors, which were translocated into the host cytoplasm independently of salmonella type iii secretion mechanisms.

RESULTS
rationale for strains used and study design
to date, more than  <dig> genes have been annotated as regulatory genes in salmonella and of those tested  we showed that  <dig> regulators including spvr, frur, ihf, phop/phoq, ssra/ssrb, slya, hnr, rpoe, smpb, csra, rpos, crp, ompr/envz, and hfq are required for virulence regulation during systemic infection in an acute mouse infection model  <cit> . salmonella strains lacking these regulators were not only attenuated for mouse virulence, but also exhibited dysregulation of many known salmonella virulence factors, including spi- <dig> genes. these regulators were linked to each other through positive or negative feedback regulation and activated spi- <dig> genes in a coordinated manner  <cit> . thus we reasoned that genes that are coordinately controlled by this set of  <dig> virulence regulators and co-regulated with known virulence factors are likely to be important for salmonella pathogenesis. we employed large-scale sample-matched multi-omic measurements of salmonella strains lacking these regulators, coupled with computational network analysis to efficiently identify such genes, which represent conservatively selected putative virulence factors.

sample-matched multi-omic profiling to infer putative virulence factors
recent studies have discovered that a large number of salmonella genes, estimated to be at least 20% of all genes, are post-transcriptionally regulated by a single regulatory mechanism  <cit> . thus mrna and protein measurements from each regulatory mutant and wild-type strain were used as complementary methods to characterize the global/genome-wide effects for each regulator. because some of the salmonella regulatory mutant strains  survived so poorly within macrophages that preparing mrna or protein from intracellular bacteria was not readily practical, we have used in vitro growth conditions that duplicate many aspects intracellular conditions, as previously described  <cit> . salmonella strains were grown independently in triplicate in four in vitro conditions: luria-bertani  logarithmic and lb stationary phases, and two acidic minimal medium  conditions, amm <dig> and amm <dig>  <cit> . lb broth, given its high osmolarity and nutrient-rich condition, partially reproduces the small intestine lumen environment, while the amm conditions, providing a low ph, low magnesium, and nutrient-deficient condition, partially mimic the intracellular milieu within the salmonella-containing vacuole   <cit> .

changes in gene expression and protein abundance between the parent wild-type strain and each isogenic mutant were evaluated across the four growth conditions. transcriptomic analysis quantified  <dig> genes across  <dig> profiling datasets  <cit> ; mass spectrometry-based label free proteomics combined with the amt tag approach  <cit> , quantified a total of  <dig> proteins  across  <dig> profiling datasets. the large volume of data generated  necessitated a computational approach to integrate the data into a single systems-level view that allows efficient and systematic identification of biomolecules important for salmonella pathogenesis.

computational analysis of an integrated multi-omics network reveals putative virulence factors
to identify proteins important for salmonella pathogenesis  in an efficient and systematic fashion we employed the context likelihood of relatedness  algorithm  <cit> . the clr algorithm can infer regulatory networks from transcriptomic data for experimentally verified regulatory interactions  <cit> ; and the topology of a gene in the inferred network is correlated with phenotypic properties of the gene, for example, its role in virulence  <cit> . we have previously inferred and validated a regulatory network from the transcriptomic profiles of the described regulatory mutants using clr  <cit> . in the current study we applied clr to the proteomics data to infer protein association networks. these networks contain information about the general regulatory structure of salmonella at the protein abundance level, but are not explicit regulatory networks. this resulted in a network of proteins and general associations between them that might indicate regulation , complex formation, or pathway membership.

in order to identify novel virulence-related proteins for further investigation we chose to examine proteins with similar abundance profiles to spi- <dig> proteins over all conditions and mutants. to include high-confidence relationships with gene products not observed in the proteomics network, we combined the protein association network with a transcript association network inferred from the corresponding transcriptomics data. extending our previous work analyzing networks inferred from transcriptomics  <cit> , we discovered that integrating data in this way increased our ability to identify genes/proteins essential for virulence using network topology, over either of the individual networks . we then combined the proteomic and transcriptomic data under stringent thresholds: high confidence protein to protein  and gene to gene  relationships were included. the resulting network and the region containing the majority of the spi- <dig> proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  clusters were identified from the network using hierarchical clustering. we examined different clustering thresholds and chose the threshold for which the spi- <dig> effector proteins were all contained in one cluster of minimal size . the cluster containing the spi- <dig> genes, corresponding to the region of the network is highlighted in figure  <dig>  a number of the genes/proteins in this cluster were also identified as highly central in the topological network analysis  and essential virulence genes were significantly enriched in this cluster  confirming its importance in virulence. in order to verify the association of this cluster with salmonella virulence, a subset of novel genes/proteins within this cluster was selected including stm <dig> , stm <dig> , stm <dig> , stm <dig>  stm <dig> , stm <dig>  stm2585a and stm <dig>  and their role in virulence was investigated as described below. analysis of these proteins showed that they are coordinately regulated at the protein abundance level by himd, phop/phoq, ssra/ssrb, rpoe, rpos, csra, and ompr/envz,  consistent with our previously published results showing that virulence genes were coordinately regulated  <cit> . three of these candidate proteins were identified as bottlenecks in our topological analysis, and thus are postulated to mediate important transitions in the system; srfn, pdgl, and stm2585a.

validation of computational predictions
computational analysis of the integrated multi-omic datasets predicted a set of putative virulence proteins. to validate our network predictions, genes encoding the eight candidate proteins were chromosomally tagged with the hemagglutinin  epitope or the amino-terminal domain of b. pertussis adenylate cyclase , and their protein abundance profiles were examined in each of the four in vitro conditions . all eight proteins  had increased expression under acidic minimal media , which partially mimics the host intracellular environment, compared to log phase growth in lb media. we next investigated expression of the eight proteins in a more physiologically relevant environment, within host macrophage cells. raw <dig>  murine macrophages were infected with the ha or cyaa'-tagged salmonella strains, and the expression of tagged-proteins was examined at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection . although expression levels varied between the salmonella strains, all eight proteins were induced more strongly inside macrophages than in lb log phase condition , which is a typical characteristic of well-characterized spi- <dig> virulence proteins/factors  <cit> . taken together, our immunoblot experiments validate the network prediction, showing that the putative virulence factors inferred from the regulatory network had a similar expression profile to that of spi- <dig> components and suggest that srfn, stm <dig>  pdgl, stm <dig>  stm <dig>  pagc, pagd, and stm2585a may be important for intracellular growth.

srfn, pagc, pagd, and stm2585a are translocated into the host cytosol
an important feature of salmonella pathogenesis is the active translocation of effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm to create a replicative niche and elude the host immune response. while more than  <dig> such secreted virulence factors have been reported to date, the full repertoire of effectors has not been catalogued  <cit> . therefore, we determined whether the eight putative virulence factors were translocated to the macrophage cytoplasm. srfn, stm <dig>  pdgl, stm <dig>  stm <dig>  pagc, pagd, and stm2585a were each fused with cyaa', a potent cyclase that requires calmodulin for synthesis of camp from atp  <cit> , and intracellular camp levels were measured at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection of macrophages . calmodulin is ubiquitous within animal cells but not within salmonella or the scv, the main salmonella reservoir within host cells  <cit> . stm <dig>  which was recently identified as srfn  <cit> , was secreted into the macrophage cytosol, although the secretion level was low compared to that of ssej, a well-studied effector protein secreted through spi- <dig> t3ss  <cit> . besides srfn, three pag proteins including pagd, pagc, and stm2585a were translocated into the host cytoplasm. stm2585a, encoding gifsy- <dig> prophage protein, has high sequence homology with pagk  and pagj  . therefore, pagk and pagj were tagged with cyaa' and their translocation was examined in macrophages in parallel. although the expression levels  and translocation levels  were variable between these, all three pagk homologues were expressed inside host cells and translocated into the cytosol. pagk, pagj, and stm2585a are small proteins composed of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids , respectively. failure to identify pagk and pagj via global transcriptomics and proteomics may be a consequence of the limited number of possible tryptic peptides available for protein identification via sequest, relatively low abundance without sub-cellular enrichment, and misidentification among pagk homologues due to their near sequence identity. translocation of srfn, pagk, pagj, and stm2585a was further validated using ccf4-am cleavage . the four putative effector proteins were fused with ß-lactamase , which can cleave ccf4-am to change its emission spectrum from green to blue when it is translocated into the cytoplasm. when macrophages were loaded with membrane-permeable ccf4-am, cells infected with salmonella bla-fusion strains exhibited blue fluorescence , which is consistent with the previous camp assay results. from our results, we infer that srfn and pag proteins are potential virulence effectors translocated into the host to manipulate cellular functions during salmonella systemic infection.

virulence properties of srfn and pagk homologues
the fact that srfn and several pag proteins including pagc, pagd, and three pagk homologues were expressed inside macrophage cells and were translocated into the host cytoplasm prompted us to investigate their roles in salmonella virulence. these proteins might contribute to salmonella survival following translocation. srfn was demonstrated to play a role in salmonella fitness within the host  <cit> . however, deletions of pagc, pagd, and pagk were reported to have no effect on virulence  <cit> . gunn et al. identified a homologue of pagk, pagj, in a  <dig>  kb duplicated dna region present in atcc  <dig> , but did not observe virulence attenuation with deletions of these homologous genes individually or in combination  <cit> . stm2585a, which was identified as another pagk homologue in this study, was expressed and translocated simultaneously with pagk and pagj. therefore, we presumed it was possible that the three homologues might carry out a redundant function and that there would be no phenotype unless all three were deleted. stm2585a was designated as pagk <dig> while pagk was renamed pagk <dig> to distinguish them. in-frame deletions of srfn, pagk <dig>  pagk <dig>  and pagj were constructed individually or in combination and their effects on bacterial proliferation ability were investigated in mice that were co-infected with an equivalent mixture of the wild-type and each deletion mutant strain to evaluate competitive index  . when the fitness of deletion strains were compared with that of wild-type bacteria in the same host, three strains, Δsrfn, Δpagk <dig>  and Δpagj/pagk1/pagk <dig>  were out-competed by wild-type bacteria resulting in a ci value less than  <dig>  the growth defect of Δsrfn and Δpagk <dig> was complemented in trans by a plasmid expressing srfn and pagk <dig> respectively . the replication of salmonella lacking pagj or pagk <dig> only was equivalent to that of wild-type bacteria, raising the possibility that the attenuated survival of the triple deletion strain  was likely attributable to the loss of pagk <dig>  however, the attenuated fitness of the triple deletion strain was restored only in part by in trans pagk <dig> expression, suggesting at least partial functional redundancy among three pagk-related proteins . modest attenuation of salmonella mutants lacking effector proteins, observed in the virulence tests, may be due to functional redundancy between virulence factors as previously described  <cit> . the effect of pagc and pagd on salmonella virulence was examined through mice infection as well, however they did not affect salmonella fitness in mice  as reported previously  <cit>  and they were excluded from further investigation which aimed to identify new virulence effectors.

exploring the translcoation pathway for srfn, pagj, pagk <dig>  and pagk2
the observation that srfn and pagk homologues, which are tranlocated into host cells, influenced salmonella virulence raised a question of how these effector proteins are translocated. considering that these proteins exhibited a similar expression profile with spi- <dig> t3ss components across  <dig> different conditions in transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, they were likely to be secreted via spi- <dig> t3ss. the t3ss is a specialized needle-like organelle made up of more than  <dig> components and delivers more than  <dig> effectors into host cells to create a hospitable environment for salmonella proliferation  <cit> . t3sss are evolutionarily related to the flagellar system and show structural similarity with this apparatus. in fact, the flagellar system has been shown to be an alternative transport machinery for some virulence factors  <cit> . in order to decipher the secretion pathway of srfn and pagk homologues, spi-1/spi- <dig> t3sss and the flagellar system were disrupted individually or in combination by deleting essential components of their secretion apparatuses . the disruption of secretion systems was verified by reduced motility of Δflgb strain on agar plates and blocked translocation of sipa  and ssej  in Δinva and Δssak strains-infected macrophages . however, translocation of srfn and pagk homologues was not abolished by any deletions, even when all three secretion systems were absent  . intriguingly, srfn and pagk homologue proteins all showed increased protein levels and translocation levels when spi- <dig> t3ss was inactivated. single deletion of the spi- <dig> t3ss or flagellar system did not appear to impair bacterial survival in macrophages and revealed equivalent expression and translocation levels of srfn and pagk homologues to those of wild-type as well, implying that the feedback regulation sensing t3ss is restricted to spi- <dig> t3ss. to further elucidate the effects of spi- <dig> t3ss on the expression of srfn and pagk homologues, mrna levels from intracellular bacteria were compared between a wild-type strain- and the spi- <dig> t3ss-defective strain -infected macrophages . transcription of srfn and pagk1/pagk2/pagj was not affected by the lack of spi- <dig> t3ss, indicating that the increases in srfn and pagk homologues observed occurred as a consequence of post-transcriptional regulation. the result that srfn, pagk <dig>  pagk <dig>  and pagj were translocated into the host cytosol independent of any t3sss and flagellar system suggests that srfn and a subset of pag proteins are translocated by an as yet unidentified mechanism.

discussion
in this study, we have investigated the global regulatory network required for salmonella virulence under specific in vitro  conditions by employing regulatory protein perturbations and high throughput sample-matched omics measurements coupled with computational network analysis. this systems-level analysis of the salmonella virulence program inferred  <dig> proteins which were clustered close to spi- <dig> virulence proteins in the regulatory network and thus were likely to be involved in pathogenicity . a set of these predicted virulence candidate proteins were tested to verify the network prediction, including srfn, pagd, pagc, stm <dig>  pdgl, stm <dig>  pagk <dig> and stm <dig>  these eight proteins were expressed more highly within macrophages than under lb log phase condition , which is characteristic of the spi-2-encoded virulence proteins and suggests that their functions may be required for intracellular growth. interestingly, srfn, pagc, pagd, pagk <dig>  were translocated to the macrophage cytoplasm , suggesting that these six proteins are secreted virulence effectors interacting with host cellular components to promote bacterial proliferation. in fact, srfn and pagk homologues were required for salmonella systemic infection in mice .

we showed that the integration of transcriptomics and proteomics data at the network level could provide enhanced predictions of components important for virulence. this is a novel way of integrating these two disparate data types, and should be applicable to other systems. three of the proteins chosen for investigation had very high betweenness measures in the network . it is interesting that the two translocated proteins from this later group, srfn and pagk <dig>  were also shown to have an effect on virulence in mice. though a limited validation, this supports our hypothesis that the topology of the network can be informative about the importance of genes/proteins. pdgl was not translocated, but possesses a phop box as other phop-regulated virulence proteins  responding to the intracellular environment  <cit>  and its inactivation rendered salmonella hypervirulent in mice infection, suggesting its crucial role concerned with salmonella intracellular fitness  <cit> , a possibility we are currently examining. our approach, combining phenotype-specific regulatory mutants with computational analysis of resultant multi-omics data, provides a novel and useful method for prediction of virulence-related genes.

osborne et al.  <cit>  recently reported that srfn, an ancestral phop-regulated gene, acquired an ssrb-regulatory module during salmonella's evolution to a pathogenic bacterium. we also verified ssrb- and phop-dependent transcription of srfn measuring mrna levels during growth in amm <dig> medium . however, they did not observe srfn translocation to the host cytoplasm  <cit> . the most probable explanation for this apparent discrepancy is due to the different cell types used, i.e., epithelial cells used in that study versus macrophages used in our study. secretion of effector proteins may be specific to the intracellular environment, which has been reported for ssej  <cit> . ssej, a spi- <dig> effector was not translocated into the cytosol of hela cells at least at  <dig> h post-infection  <cit> . macrophage-biased expression was also reported for a number of ssrb-regulated spi- <dig> genes  <cit> .

pagk was first identified as a phop-activated virulence gene, where tnphoa insertion decreased salmonella virulence significantly in mice  <cit> . however, a deletion strain lacking pagk exhibited a wild-type phenotype in virulence  <cit> . although gunn et al. identified a homologue, pagj, in a  <dig>  kb duplicated dna region; they could not reproduce virulence attenuation with deletions of these homologue genes individually or in combination, suggesting that the original transposon insertion may have affected expression of additional genes  <cit> . this virulence trait is explained by the results described here because the presence of a third related gene was not detected in that study and all three must be deleted to see the largest virulence defect. pagk  has a high amino acid identity with pagk <dig>  as well as pagj . furthermore, all of these three homologues were translocated into the host cytoplasm and negatively regulated in a similar way by spi- <dig> type iii secretion, suggesting a close correlation and shared properties among three pagk-homologous proteins. supporting the possibility of a partially redundant function among the three homologues, the attenuated survival of bacteria lacking all three genes was able to be complemented only in part by pagk <dig> expression in trans .

comparing mrna levels in Δssra/ssrb and Δphop/phoq strains, transcription of srfn and pag genes  was strongly dependent on phop, as noted previously  <cit> , and to a lesser extent on the spi-2-encoded two-component regulator ssra/ssrb, suggesting a positive role of the spi- <dig> system in their regulation . however, the absence of spi- <dig> t3ss increased the levels of srfn and pag proteins inside macrophages, even though bacterial growth was restrained due to the lack of spi- <dig> t3ss . considering the result that the lack of spi- <dig> t3ss did not increase mrna levels of srfn and pagk1/pagk2/pagj inside macrophages , the increase in srfn and pag proteins must be a consequence of post-transcriptional regulation. the negative regulation of the translation of srfn and pagk homologues by spi- <dig> t3ss raises the possibility that an activator such as a small non-coding rna differentially regulates their translation in response to the lack of spi- <dig> t3ss secretion following macrophage infection. the unusually long 5'-untranslated region of srfn  may form a complex hairpin stem-loop secondary structure that would block the ribosomal binding site and thereby interfere with translation initiation. we observed that deleting n-terminal amino acids in srfn abolished the negative regulation of spi- <dig> t3ss on srfn translation and, furthermore, hfq overexpression increased srfn translation, but not its transcription . these observations support the hypothesis that a small rna, as yet unidentified, might bind to the srfn mrna 5'-region covering the n-terminus and alleviate an inhibitory secondary structure at the translation initiation site, sensing the absence of spi- <dig> type iii secretion, as is being investigated further.

the t3ss is a typical mechanism for pathogenic bacteria to deliver virulence factors into extracellular environments. however, srfn and pagk homologues were translocated into the host cytoplasm independently from any t3sss tested in this study. as a vehicle system to deliver bacterial components to the extracellular milieu, outer membrane vesicles  have been studied over the past few decades  <cit> . deatherage et al. recently proposed a mechanism for omv biogenesis wherein envelope protein interconnections modulate omv release  <cit> . omv, observed in a variety of gram-negative pathogens, are composed of outer membrane proteins, periplasmic proteins, lipopolysaccharide , and phospholipids and transfer bacterial dnas and virulence factors to adjacent bacterial or host cells  <cit> . pagc was recently found to be secreted extracellularly via omv as a major component of the outer membrane  <cit> . the result that pagc was regulated and translocated in a similar manner with srfn and pagk homologues in our study suggests the possibility of omv-mediated transfer of srfn and pag proteins. in fact, pagk homologues were distributed as punctate compartments apart from intracellular bacteria inside macrophages in microscopic observation, supporting the possibility  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the approach of integrating multiple omics datasets  across multiple regulatory perturbations described in this study generated a robust association network in salmonella highlighting regulatory interactions and provided a precise picture of putative virulence factors. the success of this strategy to discover known and novel virulence factors suggests that the approach may have applicability for other bacterial pathogens, and thereby help to innovate the host-pathogen research paradigm  <cit> .
