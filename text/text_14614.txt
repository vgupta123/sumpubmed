BACKGROUND
recurrent airway obstruction  or heaves is a well-known respiratory disease in horses that shares any pathophysiological similarities with asthma in humans 
 <cit> . rao is a severe, potentially debilitating, chronic inflammatory airway disease typically affecting middle-aged horses. acute exacerbations are characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation, coughing, periods of labored breathing at rest and exercise intolerance due to bronchospasm and mucus accumulation in the airways 
 <cit> . it is initiated following exposure to organic dusts, molds, and lipopolysaccharides  in hay 
 <cit> . periods of acute exacerbation are interspersed by periods of remission, when horses are kept away from the causative environment 
 <cit> . the immunological processes responsible for the persistent airway inflammation are still largely unknown 
 <cit> . rao is thought to result from an aberrant immune response orchestrated by antigen-specific t lymphocytes via the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. whether these t lymphocytes have a type  <dig> or type  <dig> phenotype and cytokine secretion profile is still a matter of debate 
 <cit> . although little studied so far, innate immune mechanisms, which constitute a central interface between external stimuli and the adaptive immune system, may also play an important role in the pathophysiology of rao.

hif <dig> is an essential regulator of adaptation to low oxygen levels 
 <cit> . hif <dig> is a heterodimer composed of an oxygen-regulated α-subunit and a constitutively expressed β-subunit. in general the abundance of α-subunits is primarily regulated by a family of prolyl hydroxylases . in normoxia, phd is activated and directs the degradation of the α-subunit by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 
 <cit> .

under hypoxia, phd activity decreases, which leads to the stabilization and translocation to the nucleus of the α-subunits which heterodimerize with the β-subunit. this dimer recognizes the hypoxia response elements  to induce target gene expression. hif <dig> activity is primarily regulated by the abundance of the hif1-α subunit 
 <cit> . since hif <dig> is highly involved in the adaptation of cellular metabolism to hypoxic condition, it was also proposed that hif <dig> is an important promoter of inflammatory responses, which most often require innate immune cells to adapt to oxygen-deprived inflammatory environments 
 <cit> . indeed, it was found that hif <dig> regulates many pro-inflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin- <dig>  and vascular endothelial growth factor a  
 <cit> . hif <dig> was furthermore found to engage in cross-talk with another major pro-inflammatory pathway, the nuclear factor - κb pathway 
 <cit> . although most studies focused on hypoxic conditions, hif may promote inflammatory functions of myeloid cells also in normoxic conditions 
 <cit> . indeed, hif1-α may be indirectly activated in myeloid cells by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lps and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α 
 <cit> . after lps or cytokine stimulation, nf-κb promotes hif1-α gene transcription, promoting its accumulation in spite of post-translational degradation 
 <cit> . in myeloid cells, hypoxia through decreased hif1-α degradation and inflammatory stimuli through increased hif1-α transcription may synergistically potentiate the activation of hif <dig> 

we hypothesized that, because myeloid cells are implicated in rao, and because hif <dig> is a major regulator of the pro-inflammatory functions of myeloid cells, hif <dig> could play a role in the pathophysiology of rao. to test this hypothesis, complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches were undertaken.

firstly we assessed in vitro expression of hif <dig> mrna and its target genes in horse myeloid cells in response to hay dust. secondly, in vivo, we analyzed whether hay dust-induced lung inflammation in rao-affected horses correlated with increased hif <dig> expression in lung myeloid cells. finally, we tested whether increased hif <dig> expression in balf myeloid cells correlated with clinical variables in rao-affected horses.

RESULTS
hif1- is expressed basally and upregulated by hay dust in horse myeloid cells
we first tested the presence of hif <dig> in horse myeloid cells and assessed hay dust-induced hif <dig> activation in these cells. relative hif1-α mrna expression between excipient- and hay dust-treated monocytes was assessed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after stimulation. the hif1-α mrna was expressed basally and this expression was significantly higher in stimulated than in unstimulated-cells 1 h after the beginning of the treatment, and maximal induction was achieved after a 2 h incubation period. at 4 h, hif1-α expression was maintained at a high level .

hay dust induced pro-inflammatory genes associated with hif1-α activity in equine monocytes
we next aimed at determining whether hay dust-induced hif1-α mrna upregulation may result in increased hif <dig> activity in equine monocytes. hay dust suspensions induced a significant increase in vegf-a, il- <dig> and tnf-α expression in equine monocytes as compared with excipient-treated monocytes . we observed strong positive correlation between hif1-α induction and cytokine expression . suggesting that the in vitro induction of cytokine expression was dependent on hif1-α activity, noscapine, an inhibitor of the stabilization of hif1-α, when added to the culture 1 h before challenge with hay dust, inhibited the induction of vegf-a and il- <dig>  however, a lower effect of noscapine was observed for tnf-α. for il- <dig>  vegf-a and tnf-α, some significant differences were still seen between excipient- and noscapine/hay dust-treated groups at all-time points tested. these data support that during hay dust stimulation, hif1-α was partially required for vegf-a and il- <dig> expression in equine myeloid cells, whereas tnf-α induction was less dependent on hif <dig>  noscapine alone had no effect on the expression of these three cytokines in equine monocytes .

horse clinical status assessment
clinical scores were significantly different between both the healthy and rao groups after dust exposure . in the balf, neutrophil percentage was significantly increased in both healthy and rao horses following hay dust challenge. however, challenged rao-affected horses showed significantly higher neutrophil percentage than challenged healthy horses. after the challenge, the percentage of alveolar macrophage  in the balf was significantly decreased in rao-affected and healthy horses but the decrease was significantly higher in rao-affected horses than in healthy horses. no significant differences were observed between the percentages in lymphocytes and other cell types. after dust exposure, arterial blood oxygen partial pressure was significantly decreased in rao-affected horses when compared to healthy horses. the most sensitive value of impulse oscillometry for rao-affected horse evaluation, x5hz was significantly different between rao-affected horses and controls after challenge. clinical values for each horse are shown in table 
 <dig> 

increased hif1-α mrna expression following hay dust challenge in balf cells of healthy and rao-affected horses
to assess whether our in vitro observations may translate in vivo, we analyzed whether hay dust-induced lung inflammation in rao-affected horses was accompanied by increased hif <dig> activity in lung myeloid cells. we first compared the relative hif1-α mrna expression levels in balf cells of unchallenged and hay dust-challenged healthy and rao-affected horses. no statistically significant difference in hif1-α expression was observed between unchallenged healthy and rao-affected horses . hif1-α mrna levels significantly increased in both healthy and rao horses following hay dust challenge. however, challenged rao-affected horses showed significantly higher hif1-α mrna levels than challenged healthy horses.

hif1-α-regulated cytokines are overexpressed in the balf cells of rao-affected horses during crisis
next, the expression of hif <dig> target genes was measured in balf cells from hay dust-challenged or unchallenged healthy and rao-affected horses . no statistically significant difference in vegf-a, il- <dig> and tnf-α expression was observed between the unchallenged groups. however, we observed that vegf-a, il- <dig> and tnf-α gene expression was upregulated following hay dust challenge. il- <dig> and tnf-α mrna expression were significantly increased in both healthy and rao-affected horses upon challenge, whereas vegf-a levels was upregulated in challenged rao-affected but not healthy horses. we also observed positive correlations between hif1-α mrna expression levels and expression levels of its target genes .

correlation between hif1-α expression in lung myeloid cells and lung dysfunction
we finally aimed at determining whether hif1-α expression in lung myeloid cells correlates with lung dysfunction and inflammation. table 
 <dig> shows that in challenged rao-affected horses, hif1-α mrna expression levels were highly correlated to lung function , arterial pressure of oxygen , and the percentage of neutrophils in the balf . the correlations were positive for neutrophil percentages, and negative for x5hz and pao <dig>  no correlations were observed in challenged healthy horses.

coefficient of correlations  between hif1-α mrna levels in bronchoalveolar lavage  cells and neutrophil percentages in balf, reactance at  <dig> hz , and arterial pressure of oxygen pao <dig>  these values were measured separately in challenged healthy and recurrent airway obstruction-affected horses. 

discussion
hif <dig> is increasingly recognized as a master regulator of inflammatory responses. recently, it has been demonstrated that hif <dig> activity is increased in the lung of mouse models of asthma, as well as in balf cells from asthmatic patients 
 <cit> . in the present work, we report similar findings in horses suffering from rao, a disease that shares many similarities with human asthma. we demonstrated that the level of hif1-α mrna expression was significantly increased in balf cells of hay dust-challenged horses and that this effect was more pronounced in rao-affected than in healthy animals.

the increase in hif1-α mrna expression in balf cells of challenged horses may be explained by the presence of lps in hay dust. indeed, it has been previously demonstrated that lps induces hif1-α mrna expression through nf-κb activation in human monocytes and macrophages under normoxic conditions 
 <cit> . while administration of aerosolized lps to rao-affected horses induces airway neutrophilia, it is not sufficient to elicit an rao crisis 
 <cit> . at the present time the contribution of lps to disease severity remains unclear. yet, emerging evidence suggests that a synergistic effect may exist between inhaled lps and organic dust particulates. hif <dig> activation could also be enhanced by other components present in the hay dust, such as alternaria spores, β-glucans, which also could activate nf- κb 
 <cit> , even though this hypothesis will require further testing. from this first study, we suggest that lps or other components present in hay dust may upregulate hif1-α gene expression via nf-κb activation in both healthy and rao-affected horses, with a more pronounced effect in rao-affected horses. it is well known that nf-κb activation and hypoxia synergistically activate hif <dig> 
 <cit> . whereas nf-κb increases hif1-α mrna expression through fixation on a nf-κb site in the promoter of the hif1-α gene, hypoxia post-translationally stabilizes the hif1-α protein 
 <cit> . accordingly, it has previously been shown that nf-κb activity is significantly increased in the lungs of rao-affected horses during crisis when compared to unchallenged healthy horses 
 <cit> . moreover, during rao crises, inflammation induces a hypoxic environment in the lung tissues, which is a consequence of decreased perfusion, bronchial edema and increase in metabolic activity of recruited inflammatory cells. furthermore, as illustrated by our clinical results, inflammation-induced local tissue hypoxia may be reinforced by the fact the horses in crisis usually become hypoxemic. given that hif1-α mrna expression was significantly higher in challenged rao-affected horses than in healthy subjects, it is possible that during the challenge, healthy horses, unlike rao-affected horses, do not develop enough lung inflammation to induce hypoxia and thereby to increase hif <dig> activity. a synergy between nf-κb activation and hypoxia in inflamed airways might thereby potentiate hif <dig> activation in rao. further studies should be conducted to directly verify this hypothesis.

the observed increase in hif1-α mrna expression in balf cells of hay dust-exposed horses did not necessarily imply that hif <dig> transcriptional activity was increased. to estimate in vivo whether hif <dig> was transcriptionally active, we could evaluated the expression of known hif <dig> target genes. hay dust challenge induced a significant increase in il- <dig> and tnf-α mrna expression in healthy and rao-affected horses, and this increase was significantly more pronounced in rao-affected horses. however, only challenged rao-affected horses showed increased vegf-a expression. the use of a hif1-α inhibitor indicated that vegf-a mrna and il- <dig> mrna were highly regulated by hif <dig> in hay dust stimulated-monocytes in vitro, in line with reports that hif <dig> is able to regulate vegf-a and il- <dig> in human and murine macrophages 
 <cit> . however, the regulation of tnfα- mrna expression in monocytes after hay dust stimulation was only weakly hif <dig> dependent. it is likely that hay dust-induced tnf-α mrna expression is mainly under the control of other transcription factor such as nf-κb. following lps stimulation, hif <dig> can induce tnf-α transcription by direct fixation to the tnf-α gene promoter 
 <cit> . yet nf-κb may also induce the transcriptional activation of tnf-α independently of hif <dig> 
 <cit> .

in an in vitro study, laan and coll. 
 <cit>  reported that il- <dig> and tnfα- play a role in rao. in equine am stimulated with a hay dust solution, the expression of these two cytokines is significantly increased in rao horses compared to healthy horses 
 <cit> . in rabbits, lung hypoxia was shown to promote il- <dig> production from am 
 <cit> . moreover franchini et al. 
 <cit>  have suggested that am are implicated in the initial inflammatory reaction, since they demonstrated that release of il- <dig> by am was required for neutrophil attraction. taken together, these findings may suggest that in rao-affected horses, the exacerbation of hif <dig> activation in am might be the initial response to airborne challenges, followed by an increase of il- <dig> cytokine production and neutrophil invasion.

currently, we have no information about the role played by vegf-a in heaves. vegf-a is a potent stimulator of vascular angiogenesis, permeability, and remodeling that also plays important roles in wound healing and tissue cytoprotection 
 <cit> . the regulation of vascular permeability is essential for inflammatory processes in airways, especially in the course of chronic lung diseases 
 <cit> . in humans beings and mice, vegf-a is involved in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma 
 <cit> . given the similarities between rao and asthma it may be speculated that vegf-a could play an important role in rao pathophysiology.

the expression of these three cytokines positively correlated in vitro and in vivo with that of hif1-α. even though our in vitro observations suggest that hif <dig> activity in monocytes may contribute to expression of these cytokines in vivo, we do not rule out a possible involvement of hif <dig> in other cell types.

moreover even if monocytes are precursors of am, they are not terminally differentiated cells. therefore, some differences may exist in terms of regulation of hif <dig> expression and activity between monocytes and am. for instance, unlike am, monocytes are unable to phagocyte and cytokine production and expression of surface molecules is sometimes different 
 <cit> . however, it is well known in others species that hif1-α is expressed by am 
 <cit>  and that lps can induce hif1-α in macrophage 
 <cit> . it is thus highly likely that, like in monocytes, hif1-α may be expressed by equine am after hay dust challenge. given the causative role proposed for am in rao, increased hif1-α activity in am following hay dust exposure might thus be responsible for crisis induction in rao affected- horses.

it could also be worthwhile testing hif1-α activity in equine neutrophils after hay dust stimulation. indeed in mice, lps stimulation can induce hif <dig> activation in lung neutrophils 
 <cit> . after hay dust exposure, balf neutrophil percentage increases only in rao-affected horse and positively correlate with hif1-α mrna expression. thus, it is possible that in rao-affected horses, hay dust-induced neutrophil influx in the lung could also contribute to upregulated hif <dig> activity.

finally, we have also shown that in challenged rao-affected horses the level of hif1-α expression in balf cells correlated with the degree of lung dysfunction. it will be worthwhile testing whether pharmacological inhibition of hif <dig> in rao-affected horses may impact on disease parameters. supporting the relevance of this approach, it was shown that inhibition of hif <dig> in mice using either pharmacological inhibition or conditional gene deletion significantly reduces airway inflammation in models of asthma 
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study demonstrates that hay dust may activate hif <dig> in horse myeloid cells. it further shows that lung myeloid cells display increased hif <dig> activation upon hay dust challenge in rao-affected horses compared to healthy horses, and that this activation correlates with disease severity. our results thus suggest that it would be worthwhile testing the potential therapeutic benefit of pharmacological hif <dig> inhibition in rao.
