BACKGROUND
lipases , known as triacylglycerol acylhydrolases, are capable of catalyzing hydrolysis of long chain triacylglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerols in aqueous solutions and conducting synthetic reactions in organic media  <cit> . lipases widely exist in animals, plants and microorganisms. so far, the majority of microbial lipases characterized are from bacteria and fungi  <cit> . compared with fungal lipases, bacterial lipases are generally produced in higher yield and with lower production costs, are more amenable to genetic manipulation, exhibit improved stability in organic solvents, and possess a more diverse range of catalytic activities and substrate specificities  <cit> . therefore, bacterial lipases have received a great deal of attention, especially in biotechnological industries such as the food, detergents, oil manufacture, fine chemicals, biodiesel, optically active drugs, and polymeric materials  <cit> .

for most lipase-catalyzed reactions in industrial applications, it is important that lipases remain active in extreme conditions, such as elevated temperatures, organic solvents and/or detergents  <cit> . assuming these criteria are met, lipases may one day completely replace their chemical counterparts in industrial applications and green manufacturing processes  <cit> . unfortunately, the chemical modifications that occur in such harsh conditions may lead to inactivation of the lipases and hinder their large-scale application in industry  <cit> . therefore, lipases resistant to chemical denaturation are highly desirable, and bacterial lipases are the logical choice  <cit> . frustratingly, despite rapid development of biochemical engineering, bacterial lipases isolated from bacillus  <cit> , burkholderia  <cit>  and those identified in metagenomic libraries  <cit>  have thus far failed to fulfill industrial applications, due to poor tolerance of high temperatures. for example, lipases from pseudomonas are usually mesophilic  <cit>  or psychrophilic  <cit> . meanwhile, lipases from bacteria and archaea tolerating high or low temperatures, extremes of ph or high concentrations of salts, the so-called extremophiles, have special enzymatic characteristics, which may meet the demands of various industrial applications. however, the available number is very limited  <cit> . thus, isolating eurythermic bacterial lipases is a high priority.

polyunsaturated fatty acids  such as eicosapentaenoic acid , docosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid  from functional oils  are used to prevent and treat cancers, arteriosclerosis, inflammation and hyperlipidemia  <cit> . however, the contents of pufas of natural resources are usually less than the standard level of market product, which cannot well meet necessary intake of people . therefore, in recent years, studies on enrichment of pufas have been conducted via using fungal lipases , but most fungi lipases are sensitive to harsh conditions. on the other hand, existing bacterial lipases possessing such activity lack fatty acid selectivity  <cit> . hence, investigations for novel bacterial lipases with efficient enrichment of pufas are urgently needed.

p. moraviensis m <dig>  isolated from xinjiang autonomous regions of china, exhibited a clear degradation halo when grown on m <dig> medium containing olive-rhodamine b. but, lipases from this species have not yet been deposited in the lipase engineering database . therefore, in the present study, we successfully cloned the novel subfamily i. <dig> lipase lipm from p. moraviensis m <dig> genomic dna via touchdown pcr and genome walking, expressed the enzyme in escherichia coli, purified by refolding from inclusion bodies, performed biochemical properties characterization and investigated its use in the hydrolysis of algal oils to enrich pufas.

the effect of ph on lipm was investigated at  <dig> °c in buffers with ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> : citrate-phosphate buffer , tris–hcl buffer , and glycine–naoh buffer . the optimal temperature was detected at 0- <dig> °c with an interval of  <dig> °c  in tris–hcl buffer  using p-np caprylate as substrate. to determine the thermal stability of lipm, the purified enzyme was incubated in  <dig> mm tris–hcl  at various temperatures, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> °c for different time intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> h. at each time interval, samples were pipetted out and the residual activity was immediately assayed at  <dig> °c and ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min using p-np caprylate as substrate. the kinetic parameters of lipm were tested in  <dig> mm tris–hcl  at  <dig> °c using p-np caprylate at different concentrations . the km and vmax, were determined from the lineweaver-burk plot using the microsoft excel software.

effects of additives on lipm

substrate specificity
the purified lipm possessed the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl  esters with fatty acyl chains ranging from c <dig> to c <dig> , and exhibited maximum lipase activity towards p-np caprylate . compared with p-np caprylate , the relative activities of lipm towards other substrates were as follows: p-np acetate  was  <dig>  %, p-np butyrate   <dig>  %, p-np caprate   <dig>  %, p-np laurate   <dig>  %, p-np myristate   <dig>  %, and p-np palmitate   <dig>  %. lipm therefore showed higher activity towards medium/long chain substrates . additionally, the activity of lipm towards olive oil was  <dig>  u/mg− <dig> fig.  <dig> characterization of lipm and effects of additives on lipm. a specific activities of lipm towards p-np esters of various chain lengths ; b the ph profile of lipm. these relative activities of lipm were measured at different ph values. the enzyme activity in tris-hcl  was taken as 100 %. buffers used  were citrate-phosphate buffer , tris–hcl buffer , and glycine-naoh buffer ; c effect of temperature on the activity of lipr; d thermal stability of lipm. the enzyme was incubated at  <dig> °c ,  <dig> °c ,  <dig> °c ,  <dig> °c  and  <dig> °c  and for the indicated time



effects of ph and temperature on enzyme activity
the recombinant lipm exhibited maximum activity towards p-np caprylate at ph  <dig>   and retained more than 55 % of activity between ph  <dig>  to  <dig> . however, at a ph less than  <dig> more than 90 % of activity was lost, suggesting that it is an alkaline lipase. lipm displayed maximal activity at 65 °c , and retained over 50 % of activity between 40–85 °c, with  <dig>  % at 95 °c,  <dig>  % at 20 °c and  <dig>  % at 10 °c . these results suggest that lipm is a eurythermic lipase that functions well across a wide temperature range. additionally, p-np caprylate was the preferred substrate, with km of  <dig>  mm and a kcat of  <dig>  s− <dig>  and a catalytic efficiency  of  <dig>  s− <dig> mm− <dig> 

the thermostability of lipm was studied in tris–hcl  at 60 °c, 65 °c, 70 °c, 75 °c and 85 °c for 12 h . after incubation for 12 h at 60 °c and 65 °c, lipm retained over 90 % of its original activity. incubation at 70 °c and 75 °c for 5 h resulted in over 60 % of maximal activity and  <dig>  % of activity was remained after exposure at 85 °c for 2 h, indicating a very high thermostability. however, it was inactivated when incubated at 75 °c and 85 °c in a pseudo-first-order manner, with t1/ <dig> values of 435 min and 60 min, respectively.

effects of metal ions, inhibitors, organic solvents and detergents
at a final concentration of 1 mm or 10 mm, lipm was enhanced by ca2+ , ba2+ , mn2+  and sr2+ , respectively . however, lipm was fully inhibited by fe2+ and strongly inhibited by ni2+ , cu2+ , co2+ , zn2+ , and edta . strong activation by ca2+ is consistent with the predicted calcium-binding sites  <cit> . in contrast, mg2+, k+, na+, dtt and β-me had little or no effect on the catalytic activity of lipm at 1 mm or 10 mm. lipm contains no cysteine residues, consistent with the lack of any effect on activity with the known reducing agents dtt and β-me, which can reduce the disulfide bonds of proteins and prevent the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues  <cit> . both dtt and β-me had almost no effect on lipm, which proves that lipm is a lipase without cysteine residues.fig.  <dig> effects of additives on lipm activity. a effects of different metal ions and inhibitors on lipm activity, measured at 1 mm  and 10 mm  final concentrations; b effects of some organic solvents on lipm activity, tested at 15 %  and 30 %  final concentrations; c effects of some detergents on lipm activity, studied at  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  final concentrations. the residual activity was measured by a standard assay. the values represent the means of three independent experiments 



lipm activity was decreased to some extent when treated with 15 %  or 30 %  organic solvents . specifically, activity was decreased by more than 40 % in a mixture of 15 %  acetonitrile, propanetriol, dmso, acetone, tert-butanol, peg- <dig> and peg- <dig>  when the concentration of the aforementioned organic solvents was increased to 30 % , lipm activity was strongly inhibited. comparatively, 15 %  isopropanol, methanol and ethanol had little or no effect on lipm, and even 30 % , more than 80 % of activity remained. high stability and activity in organic solvents are major advantages for the industrial application of enzymes  <cit> , and of bacterial lipases in particular. the outstanding stability of lipm in isopropanol, methanol and ethanol may therefore prove useful for use in biocatalysis such as optical resolution of chiral compounds, organic synthesis  <cit> .

detergents affected the activity of lipm at concentrations of  <dig>  % or  <dig>  % . lipm retained over 90 % of its initial activity in the presence of  <dig>  % detergents, even with ionic detergents sds  and ctab , the activities of lipm was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold of the initial one. when the concentration of detergents was increased to  <dig>  %, lipm retained 30–40 % of its original activity in the presence of the ionic detergents sds and ctab, and 60 % in the presence of the non-ionic detergents tween- <dig>  tween- <dig>  triton x- <dig> and np- <dig>  which is reminiscent of the lipase sal-pp <dig> from staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . moreover, due to higher tolerance to non-ionic than ionic detergents, lipm may have potential for use in the detergents industry.

selective hydrolysis of algal oil to enrich pufas
according to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  analysis , algal oil contains 14: <dig> , 16: <dig> , 16: <dig>  18: <dig> , 18: <dig> , 18: <dig> , 20: <dig> , 22: <dig> , and 22: <dig> . approximately  <dig>  % of algal oil in the form of triacylglycerols , and the pufas epa, dpa and dha account for  <dig>  %, suggesting it may be suitable for pufas enrichment.fig.  <dig> selective hydrolysis of algal oil by lipm. a the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry  analysis of raw algal oil showed kinds of fatty acid methyl esters. c14: <dig>  methyl tetradecanoate; c16: <dig>  hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester; c16: <dig>  9-hexadecenoic acid, methyl ester; c18: <dig>  methyl stearate; c18: <dig>  9-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester; c18: <dig>   <dig> -octadecadienoic acid, methyl ester; c20: <dig>   <dig> , <dig> , 17-eicosapentaenoic acid, methyl ester; c22: <dig>   <dig> , <dig> ,16-docosapentaenoate, methyl ester; c22: <dig>   <dig> , <dig> , <dig> -docosahexaenoate, methyl ester; b the gc–ms analysis of algal oil showed kinds of fatty acid methyl esters after hydrolyzing for 3 h. c thin layer chromatography  analysis after hydrolysis algal oil of lipm. 1:tga ; 2:dga ; 3: oleic acid ; 4:raw algal oil; 5–8: algal oil was hydrolyzed to remained partially triacylglycerols , produce corresponding diacylglycerols  and free fatty acids  at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h. d according to the analysis of hplc, the relative contents of produced diacylglycerols  after hydrolyzing different time



gc-ms analysis of algal oils following hydrolysis by lipm showed that medium chain  fatty acids were released prior to long chain  and/or polyunsaturated fatty acids . after 3 h of hydrolysis, the relative content of epa, dpa and dha in the derivative glycerides increased to  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %, respectively . this accounted for  <dig>  %, which was much higher than the pufa content  of algal oil before hydrolysis with lipm. the above result also indicates that lipm has strong substrate specificity for particular fatty acids.

in addition, tlc analysis revealed that hydrolysis of algal oil by lipm produced diacylglycerols  and free fatty acids , but some tags remained . hplc analysis demonstrated that the raw algal oil contained  <dig>  % dags , while the relative content of dags in the derived glycerides was increased substantially during the first 2 h of hydrolysis, and peaked at  <dig>  % before gradually decreasing  <dig>  % between 3–8 h .

discussion
touchdown pcr offers a simple and rapid means to optimize pcr approaches, without the need for lengthy optimizations and/or redesigning of primers  <cit> . together with the genome walking method, touchdown pcr was used successfully to amplify lipa from acinetobacter sp. xmz- <dig>  <cit>  and lip i. <dig> from pseudomonas cr- <dig>  <cit> . so far, the genome of p. moravensis has not been published, and thus potential lipase genes were cloned using primers based on conserved motifs. in general, degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences upstream and downstream of the conserved ghslg motif of subfamily i. <dig> lipases  <cit> . upon close inspection of sequence alignment data, the snvlnigye and ntflfsgaf motifs  and ) were also found to be conserved among subfamily i. <dig> lipases, and this knowledge was used to design degenerate primers t <dig> and t <dig>  till now, there are no relative reports on the design degenerate primers for the two regions. touchdown pcr and genomic walking using these primers resulted in amplification of the full-length lipm. thus, the two different domains can be used for degenerate primer design for amplification of subfamily i. <dig> lipase genes in future work. additionally, we showed that touchdown pcr and genome walking approaches can be effective for cloning genes from organisms whose genome sequences are not available.

most industry processes are performed at temperatures higher than 50 °c, and thermostable enzymes are of great importance  <cit> . even thermostable lipases  lose activity to some extents during long incubations at temperatures exceeding 60 °c. the results of the present study showed that lipm is unusually highly thermostable, indicating great potential use in various industries including fat and oil modification, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, organic synthesis, oleo-chemicals and biodiesel production  <cit> . lipases with a broad temperature range have been reported, including eh <dig> that has a temperature range of 30 °c–80 °c  <cit> , lipz <dig>   <cit> , sal-pp <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, lipm displays an even a broader temperature range of from  and is one of the most eurythermic lipases ever discovered. this indicates that lipm has great potential for various high-temperature industrial applications such as the removal of pitch from pulp in the paper industry, the removal of subcutaneous fat in the leather industry  <cit> , as a medium-temperature catalyst in the enrichment of pufas  <cit> , and as a low-temperature catalyst in the food or detergent industries  <cit> .table  <dig> characterization on thermostability of some bacterial lipases

lipases are diverse in their sensitivity to solvents  <cit> , and their stability in the presence of organic solvents is a requisite property when used in non-aqueous systems  <cit> . in this study, lipase lipm from p. moraviensis m <dig> exhibited fair stability in the presence of 15 % and 30 % of different organic solvents, as the decrease in activity of lipase was obvious in the presence of most of the organic solvents. similar result was observed by sarker  <cit>  for alkali-thermostable lipase from s. aureus. this phenomenon may be due to the reduction of water activity around the protein molecules promoting structural denaturation  <cit> . with the treatment of 30 % of ethanol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol, lipm retained almost the same or higher relative activity with that of the lipase from acinetobacter eh <dig>  <cit> . however, organic solvent tolerance of lipm incubating at 65 °c for 2 h was obviously stronger than the lipase from acinetobacter eh <dig> incubating at 50 °c for 1 h  <cit> , lipa from b. cepacia atcc  <dig> incubating at 37 °c for 2 h  <cit> , and sal-pp <dig> from s. aureus incubating at 37 °c for 90 min  <cit> . thus, it can be seen that lipm has greater potential than the latter three lipases in application in organic synthetic industry and transesterification reaction. additionally, 30 % of acetone could increase the activity of lipa from b. cepacia atcc  <dig>  <cit> , 30 % of dmso and acetone had stimulatory effect on the activity of lipase from acinetobacter eh <dig>  <cit> , 30 % of dmso and methanol could also activated the lipase from aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus strain hz  <cit>  and lipa from acinetobacter sp. xmz- <dig>  <cit> , while there was no stimulation effect on lipm by the above mentioned solvents. it is well known that the effect of organic solvents on enzyme activity differs from lipase to lipase  <cit> . these results can be generally explained that different solvents may induce some different structural changes in enzymes and cause various degree of disaggregation of lipases, resulting in varying residual activities  <cit> . moreover, there is no clear correlation between the solubility of an organic solvent in water and the stability of lipase in its presence  <cit> .

current research on the enrichment of pufas suggests more wore is certainly needed , although there has been some success. immobilized rhizopus japonicas lipase enriched dha in soybean oil from 18 % to 25 %  after reacting for 24 h  <cit> . similarly, hydrolysis of sardine oil by lipase from aspergillus niger and mucor javanicus for 3 h increased dha from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % , respectively  <cit> , while a 4 h hydrolysis of oil from chlorella protothecoides with immobilized yllip <dig> increased dha content from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %   <cit> . in the present study, hydrolysis of algal oil by lipm for 3 h increased dha from  <dig>  % up to  <dig>  %  and the total percentage of pufas  from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % . lipm therefore appears to be superior for dha enrichment and the simultaneous enrichment of epa and dpa from algal oil indicates great potential in pufas enrichment.table  <dig> characterization of some lipases for enriching pufas

dags consist of diesters of glycerol and contain at least 90 % acylglycerols, and are therefore classified as non-ionic surfactants  <cit> . unlike ionic tensoactive agents, dags show no side effects whenever ingested or applied to skin  <cit> , and can be widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries  <cit> . hydrolysis of algal oil by lipm for 2–3 h increased the percentage of dags in the derived glycerides. to our knowledge, this is the first report of such an activity in combination with the simultaneous enrichment of epa, dpa and dha, meanwhile with increase of dags in the derivative glycerides. therefore, lipm possess great potential prospect in future industrial applications.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified and isolated a novel subfamily i. <dig> lipase from p. moraviensis m <dig>  detailed biochemical characterization revealed lipm to be unusually eurythermic and thermostable, and medium tolerant to organic solvents and detergents. in addition, lipm was particularly effective for enriching pufas, indicating potential as a biocatalyst for future food industrial applications.
