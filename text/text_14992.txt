BACKGROUND
the mammalian cerebral cortex contains a large number of neurons of different phenotypes arranging in a stereotypical laminar pattern  <cit> . a series of sequential cellular events happen during cortical development, including neural progenitor proliferation, cell fate specification, neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth and pathfinding, and eventually the formation and plastic modulation of synaptic connections  <cit> . the happening of all these developmental events depends on the precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression in the cell. extensive studies have been carried out to clarify the role of transcription factors, including activators and repressors, in the regulation of gene transcription during these developmental events. in addition to transcriptional regulation, various types of small non-coding rnas in the cell have been shown to play significant roles in the control of gene expression during physiological and pathological processes  <cit> , largely increasing the complexity and flexibility of the gene regulatory network. micrornas  are a group of most extensively studied small rnas of around 18– <dig> nucleotide  with the typical stem-loop structure  <cit> . most mature mirnas directly interact with a group of messenger rnas  and suppress their expression either by guiding the cleavage of the target mrnas or by inhibiting their translation upon imperfect base pairing to mrna’s 3′- untranslated region   <cit> . interestingly, some mature mirnas can undergo changes of one or more nucleotides in their “seed” sequence, a process known as mirna editing, which further increases the complexity of gene regulation  <cit> . in addition to mirnas, other classes of small rnas, including repeat associated small interference rna , piwi-interacting rna , and small rnas derived from transfer rna , ribosomal rna , small nucleolar rna , small nuclear ribonucleic acid rna , small cytoplasmic rna , and signal recognition particle rna , also play constitutive or regulatory functions in various cellular events.

a number of brain mirnas appear to be developmentally regulated, with high expression in neural progenitors but not in differentiated neurons, or vice versa  <cit> , suggesting that they may function at different stages of neuronal development  <cit> . as well characterized examples, mir- <dig> has been shown to regulate embryonic neurogenesis by targeting the transcription factor tlx  <cit> ; mir- <dig>  <cit>  and mir- <dig>  <cit>  have been identified as regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation; mir- <dig> have been shown to promote neuronal differentiation and regulate adult neurogenesis  <cit> ; and mir- <dig> have been shown to regulate dendritic spine morphology through inhibiting the local translation of limk <dig>  <cit> . links between mirna dysfunction and neurological diseases have become more and more apparent. for example, mutation in the seed region of mir- <dig> causes familial keratoconus with cataract  <cit>  and mutations in the seed region of mir- <dig> are responsible for nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss  <cit> . variation in the mir- <dig> binding site of fgf <dig> confers risk for parkinson diseases by up-regulation of α-synucein  <cit> . interference of mirna biogenesis by disrupting the mirna processing enzyme dicer in the nervous system has provided the evidences that mirnas are essential for the development of the nervous system  <cit> . conditional knock-out of dicer in the mouse telencephalon resulted in a size reduction of the forebrain, likely caused by apoptosis of differentiating neurons  <cit> . similar neuronal death was observed when dicer was inactivated postnatally in the cerebellum  <cit>  or in dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain  <cit> . these findings are consistent with an important role of mirnas in regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation in developing brain. however, which mirnas are expressed at different developmental stages and how various mirnas are engaged in the regulation of each developmental event remain largely unknown.

recently, next-generation sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for clarifying the expression profile of small rnas. the advantages of the massive parallel sequencing technique lie in its unbiased high-throughput detection of small rnas at a genome-wide scale, even for low-abundance transcripts, and in its unparalleled ability in identifying novel rna transcripts and modification of rnas such as rna editing. although the next-generation sequencing had started to be used to examine the brain transcriptome  <cit> , a systematic analysis of mirnas in developing brain using this new high-throughput method is largely lacking.

in the present study, we applied the next-generation sequencing technique to carry out a systematic analysis of mirnas isolated from rat neocortex of many developmental stages. in addition to the demonstration of dynamic and stage-specific expression of a large group of known mirnas, we identified a group of novel mirna candidates in rat cortex with functional hints. interestingly, we observed profound nucleotide editing of “seed” and flanking sequences of mirnas during cortical development. the dataset described here will be a valuable resource for clarifying new regulatory mechanisms for cortical development and disease and will greatly contribute to our understanding of the divergence, modification, and function of mirnas.

RESULTS

as shown in the work flow , rna samples were extracted from rat cortical tissues of eight developmental stages . a rna integrity number  was evaluated to monitor the general quality of extracted rna samples  <cit> . as shown in figure  s <dig>  rin of all samples are ≥ <dig> , indicating high quality and low degradation of these samples  <cit> . rna samples were size-selected  and sequenced by solexa technique  <cit> . two independent p <dig> samples were assayed  in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the experimental procedures. each sample was sequenced twice  and results were averaged to reduce experimental errors. we obtained approximately  <dig> million total reads for each sample after removal of low quality reads and contaminants , with the peak length of each sample at about 20– <dig> nt . small rna reads > <dig> nt were annotated based on their sequences, and their relative abundances were determined by their counts, normalized to the total read number and shown as transcripts per million reads   <cit> . to minimize the false positive signal, only reads that were detected in both two sequencings  were used for further bioinformatics analysis.

this small rna quantification based on deep-sequencing was highly reproducible, as reflected by a high pearson’s correlation coefficient between mirna levels of the two independent p <dig> tissue samples  . consistent with a peak of the length distribution at around 20– <dig> nt, we found that mirnas were the major fraction of small rnas detected in rat cortex at all developmental stages . rrnas are known to play important roles in the protein synthesis machinery. interestingly, small rnas derived from rrna at e <dig> were significantly higher than all other stages . consistently, as shown in figure 1d, the total expression levels for small rnas derived from scrnas, snrnas, and snornas, three groups of small rnas that contribute to the biogenesis of rrnas or to the protein synthesis, all significantly correlated with that of rrna-derived small rnas, with a peak at e <dig>  since e <dig> is characterized by onset of neurogenesis in rat cerebral cortex  <cit> , the peak of rrna-derived small rnas at e <dig> suggests an important role of regulation of protein synthesis for the onset of cortical neurogenesis. other classes of small rnas detected in cortical tissues, including pirna-like rnas and rasirnas as well as those derived from trnas and srprnas, exhibited gradual reduction in their expression during development.

identifying and profiling of known mirnas
by aligning clean reads to precursors of known mirnas in the mirbase   <cit> , we identified approximately  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> mirna*  expressed in cortical tissues of at least one of the eight developmental stages . currently, there are  <dig> mature rno-mirnas and  <dig> rno-mirnas* deposited in mirbase database, and close to fifty percent of these known mirnas are expressed in rat cortex. to further validate the deep-sequencing results, we chose  <dig> mirnas with typical expression profile during development  for further analysis using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction   <cit> . we found that the expression patterns of most of these mirnas revealed by qpcr were consistent with deep-sequencing results  with the exception of only four mirnas , which exhibited minor discrepancy between qpcr and deep-sequencing results at p <dig>  these results further showed the high accuracy of deep-sequencing in detection and quantification of the relative expression levels of most mirnas. the expression level of one extensively studied mirna rno-mir- <dig>  which plays important roles in regulation of embryonic stem cell differentiation and synapse plasticity  <cit> , was used as a relative standard to judge the abundance of detected mirnas. the expression levels of rno-mir- <dig> in our samples were  <dig>  and  <dig>  tpm at e <dig> and p <dig>  respectively, and were less than  <dig> tpm at other stages. we found that there were  <dig> mirnas whose expression was > <dig> tpm at more than one developmental stages, and  <dig> mirnas exhibited < <dig> tpm expression in all developmental stages. this means that although most known mirnas were detected in cortex, only one-third was abundantly expressed and may play significant roles during cortical development, although other relatively low-abundance mirnas may also play some roles. the top  <dig> most abundant mirnas at each developmental stage are summarized in table  <dig> 

we observed that although there was no obvious difference in the total number of unique mirnas detected in cortex across different developmental stages, the expression level of different mirnas in cortex was very dynamic over stages. we carried out the clustering analysis for all detected known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna candidates  based on their relative expression levels . dataset s <dig> shows a list of these known and novel mirnas in the order of clustering result. as shown in figure  <dig>  more mirnas exhibited higher expression level in earlier developmental stages than later stages. nearly 40 % of mirnas had the highest abundance at e <dig>  moreover, more mirnas exhibited a higher abundance in early developmental stages  and late developmental stages  than in middle stages . overall, the expression patterns of mirnas fell into four main categories:  enriched in early embryonic stages, especially at e <dig> and e <dig> and decreased gradually during development ;  enriched late postnatally, especially at p <dig> and p <dig>  and tended to increase over time ;  peaked around neonatal stage , either highest peak or lowest peak.

the expression profile of mirnas provides a hint of their potential functions during development. for example, at e <dig>  which is a stage of fast proliferation and expansion of cortical progenitor cells, more than  <dig> mirnas exhibited higher expression than any other developmental stages. some of these mirnas, i.e. rno-mir-34c, rno-mir-449a, rno-mir-301b, rno-mir-532-5p, rno-mir-219-5p, rno-mir- <dig>  and rno-mir- <dig>  were even 10-fold more abundant at e <dig> than at any other stages, providing a hint that these  <dig> mirnas may play important roles in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation. at about e <dig>  when the first waves of neurons are produced from neural progenitor cells in rat cortex  <cit> , we found that  <dig> mirnas were particularly high at this stage, including rno-mir-199a-3p, rno-mir- <dig>  rno-mir- <dig>  and rno-mir-7a, suggesting important roles of these mirnas in neurogenesis. at neonatal stage , when the majority of pyramid neurons have already migrated to their destinations and are extending axons and dendrites  <cit> , we found high expression of several mirnas at this stage, i.e. rno-mir- <dig> and rno-mir-19b. consistently, a previous study showed that mir- <dig> regulates neuronal maturation by targeting the ubiquitin ligase mib- <dig>  <cit> . dataset s <dig> provides a complete list of the name and relative abundance  of all detected known mirnas.

we note that during the preparation of this manuscript, one group reported the identification of two novel mirnas from the brain tissue named as rno-mir-344b-5p and rno-mir-3559-5p  <cit> . our work further verified their finding of these two novel mirnas in brain tissues . the expression of rno-mir-344b-5p gradually elevated during development, suggesting that its function may involve late developmental processes like the synapse development and plasticity  <cit> . expression of rno-mir-3559-5p dropped over development, with a peak at e <dig>  suggesting a potential role in embryonic neurogenesis.

identification of potential novel mirnas in cortex
one advantage of deep-sequencing in mirna detection is its ability to discover potential novel mirnas. in the current study, the mireap algorithm  <cit>   was employed to call all candidate mirna precursors with hairpin-like structures . altogether,  <dig> potential novel mirnas were identified in this study when annotated to the mirbase release  <dig> . dataset s <dig> provides a complete list of the name and relative abundance for all novel mirna candidates based on annotation to release  <dig>  of mirbase. the predicted structure of  <dig> newly identified mirnas are shown in figure  s <dig> as examples. the existence of these  <dig> novel candidates was further verified by rt-pcr, together with several recently identified mirnas . we found that those with extremely low reads failed to be consistently detected using pcr . overall, eight of the  <dig> novel candidates were verified by pcr . the expression pattern of  <dig> highly expressed novel candidates were also verified using qpcr with consistent results as that of deep-sequencing . the number of potential novel mirnas detected by deep-sequencing was very diverse over development , and the expression level of most novel candidates was very low. out of the total  <dig> novel candidates, only  <dig> candidates were expressed at a relatively high abundance and were thus more likely to play important biological functions in brain. among these  <dig> candidates, candidate  <dig> was enriched at e <dig> , and was not detected in any other developmental stages. the expression level of the candidate  <dig> reached a peak at p <dig>  a stage characterized with the peak of gliogenesis in rat cerebral cortex  <cit> . next, we compared the expression level of candidate  <dig> in different tissues including cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, skin, heart, and skin. we found that this novel candidate was enriched in central nerve system .

to test whether the biogenesis of novel candidates depends on dicer, we compared the expression level of mouse homologues of candidate novel mirnas in cortical tissue of wild type mice and mutant littermates of brain-specific knockout of dicer . as positive control, the expression of three known mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and the newly identified mir-344b-5p, was significantly reduced in dicer knockout brain. the expression levels of mouse candidate  <dig> also significantly decreased in homozygous knockout brains , further supports the notion that it indeed belongs to the category of mirna.

dataset s <dig> provides a complete list of the name and relative abundance  for all detected novel mirnas, some of which were selected for clustering analysis together with known mirnas . to get functional hints for these novel candidates, we predicted the potential target genes of these mirnas by using targetscan  <cit> , and carried out gene ontology  enrichment analysis with gorilla of predicted target genes . we found that the potential function of candidate  <dig> may be involved in regulating energy production and g-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. considering that candidate  <dig> has highest expression at p <dig>  which is a peak stage for gliogenesis in cortex  <cit> , we further examined whether it affects the proliferation of glial cells using cultured rat c <dig> glial cell line. interestingly, overexpression of candidate  <dig> in c <dig> cells increased the cell proliferation, whereas suppressing the endogenous candidate  <dig> by overexpressing a specific sponge rna  <cit>  reduced the cell proliferation . this result supports the notion that this novel mirna may regulate the gliogenesis during cortical development.

potential stage-specific rna modification during cortical development
recent studies showed that mirnas may undergo cleavage at the 3’ end by specific exoribonuclease, resulting in the existence of multiple isoforms of variant lengths   <cit> . we note that in all cortical rna samples, variability in the length of mirnas was detected as addition and/or trimming of nucleotides at both 3’ end and 5’ end of mature mirnas. majority of known mirnas underwent trimming at both 3’ and 5’ ends. however, trimming for several mirnas including rno-mir-1*, rno-mir-196a*, rno-mir- <dig>  rno-mir- <dig>  and rno-mir- <dig> was not detected, possibly due to the low abundance of trimmed isoforms rather than a selective protection of modifications. consistent with previous findings in drosophila  <cit>  and in human <cit> , we found that 3’ end trimming is the most frequent type of isomir in all cortical samples . this also suggests that there is no stage-specific regulation of the trimming of mirnas. dataset s <dig> provides a complete list of the name and relative abundance  of all detected isomirs of known mirnas.

rna editing has emerged as one important posttranscriptional mechanism that introduces nucleotide changes in rna sequence, such as cytidine  to uridine  and adenosine  to inosine  via deamination  <cit> , and may play important regulatory roles in the nervous system  <cit> . although the majority of editing events happens to pri-mirna and appear to affect the mirna processing step, some nucleotide alterations happen in the “seed” sequence of mature mirnas  <cit> . these edited mature mirnas with altered “seed” sequence are likely to suppress a set of genes different from those targeted by unedited mirnas. we systemically examined the nucleotide changes of mature mirnas by alignment of unannotated tags with mature sequence of mirnas allowing one nucleotide mismatch  <cit> . we discovered  <dig> mirnas with single nucleotide modification located across the mature sequence with obviously higher frequency of modification detected at the “seed” and flanking regions . the existence of such a peak in nucleotide changes at “seed” and flanking sequences suggests that most observed nucleotide changes were not caused by random mutations during sequencing, but by active mirna editing in the cell. besides the well-known “a” to “i” modification, many other rna editing events were also discovered such as “a” to “c” and “g” to “t” , consistent with a widespread rna editing discovered in previous human transcriptome studies  <cit> . although the expression level of the majority of edited mirnas was very low, some particularly high frequent editing events happened at certain developmental stages. taking rno-mir- <dig> as an example, highest frequency of “a” to “c” editing at position  <dig> and “g” to “t” editing at position  <dig> was observed at p <dig>  whereas “g” to “t” editing at position  <dig> was highest at p <dig> .

we found that the number of mirnas with a relatively high editing events  was much higher after p <dig> than at earlier developmental stages . moreover, the percentage of total edited mirna reads among total mirna reads was also much higher after p <dig> than earlier stages . similar tendency was observed for mirnas of high editing events  . these results suggest the necessity of mirna editing for complex regulation of gene expression at late postnatal stages, potentially contributing to the complicated synaptic wiring. as a distinguished representative of mirna editing, rno-mirna- <dig> family have been extensively studied  <cit> . the previously reported “a” to “i” editing at position  <dig>  of rno-mirna-376b was also detected in the present study by both deep-sequencing and pcr-based sequencing . deep-sequencing results showed that the level of this “a” to “i” editing at position  <dig> of rno-mirna-376b increased during cortical development. surprisingly, the expression level of edited sequence exceeded that of the wild type form from p <dig> and reaches the peak at p <dig> , indicating that the edited sequence may play important roles in late postnatal development of cortex. to further understand the biological significance of this editing event of rno-mir-376b, target prediction and go analysis was introduced . we found that the potential function of wild type rno-mir-376b may be mainly related to early developmental events including neuronal differentiation, cell migration, axon extension, and establishment or maintenance of neuronal polarity. however, the potential function of the edited isoform shifted to the regulation of late developmental events including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and adult feeding behavior . interestingly, results of this go analysis are fully consistent with the high expression of the wild type rno-mir-376b and the edited isoform at early developmental stages and late postnatal stages, respectively. dataset s <dig> provides a complete list of the name and relative abundance  for all detected editing of mirnas, with tpm > <dig> highlighted.

discussion
accumulating evidences showed that different groups of small non-coding rnas play fundamental roles in gene regulatory networks. as the most abundant group of small rnas in many tissues, mirnas play important regulatory roles in physiological and developmental processes. in the nervous system, mirnas can also function as important mediator of various pathological processes  <cit> . recently, exogenous expression of mir-9/9* and mir- <dig> in human fibroblasts was shown to convert these cells into neurons  <cit> , suggesting the wide application potential of mirnas. here, we took advantage of high-throughput sequencing technology to quantitatively analyze the expression of mirnas in rat cortical tissues of many developmental stages. we found that mirnas showed a wide diversity of expression pattern during cortical development. some mirnas seem to be preferentially enriched in early embryonic cortex, whereas others exhibited a higher abundance in postnatal tissue, indicating distinct roles played by these different groups of mirnas in controlling cortical development. the expression patterns of some mirnas observed in our study are consistent with what were observed in previous studies by using the blot-array and northern blot assays, i.e. mir-125b, mir- <dig>  and mir-181a  <cit> , as well as mir-29a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . we note that the developmental expression pattern of mirnas provides a hint of their potential functions. the dataset described here will thus provide an enriched resource for searching mirnas that may play key regulatory roles at different stages of cortical development. in support of this notion, we observed that the novel mirna candidate  <dig> promoted the proliferation of cultured c <dig> glial cells, consistent with the high expression of this mirna around the peak stage for gliogenesis in cortex . it would also be very interesting to explore whether the expression of this novel mirna correlates with and contributes to the happening of glioma in human patients.

one recent study reported strain-specific mirnas in rats. the authors provided an in-depth analysis of small rna profiles of six different tissues  of two different rat strains   <cit> . we found that the majority of mirnas they discovered can be confirmed in our study. several mirnas including rno-mir- <dig>  rno-mir-666-3p, and rno-mir-2985-3p were not detected in our study. in contrast, several e10-enriched mirnas identified in our study, including rno-mir-181a, rno-mir-449a, and rno-mir- <dig>  were not detected in their results. these differences in mirna detection may due to the failure of detection of some low abundance ones in different studies. the existence of strain-specific expression of several mirnas may also be responsible for the differential detection in different studies. moreover, we detected the expression of low abundance mirnas that have not been detected before using other techniques. one example is mir- <dig>  which was reported to be specifically expressed in postnatal cortex  <cit> . however, our results showed that mir- <dig> was also expressed in embryonic cortex with much lower abundance, indicating that high throughput sequencing is much more sensitive than conventional methods.

besides the identification of dozens of novel mirnas at each developmental stage, we observed in developing cortex extensive rna editing in the mirna “seed” and flanking sequences. since most nucleotide changes at specific position of mirnas was detected up to hundreds or even thousands of times, and the relative abundance of certain modified mirnas at different developmental stages was not proportional to that of the wild type mirnas, it is unlikely that the nucleotide changes we observed were caused by random errors during sequencing. the high tendency of nucleotide changes at “seed” and flanking sequence also supports the existence of a highly-regulated “editing” process . we found that the predicted target genes of the wild type rno-mir- <dig> and the “a” to “i” edited isoform are of totally different functional groups . interestingly, the relative abundance of “a” to “i” editing of rno-mir- <dig> gradually increased during development and surpassed that of wild type isoform at p <dig>  indicating that rna editing may be a new strategy for the regulation of gene expression during brain development.

previous study showed that adenosine deaminases  catalyze the “a” to “i” editing of rnas  <cit> . editing of glutamate receptor by adars is involved in neural development and diseases  <cit> . cytidine deamination by members of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing complex polypeptide 1-like  family of enzymes has also been shown to be an important mechanism for the silencing of retrovirus and transposable elements  <cit> . interestingly, our preliminary study showed that both adar and apobec family members could be detected in developing cortical tissue . for the mirna editing in developing cortex, a number of questions remain to be clarified in the future:  are adar and/or apobec family proteins responsible for the different types of editing of cortical mirnas?  are there other enzymes contributing to the mirna editing in cortex?  how the nucleotide-specificity of the editing is achieved?  how is the mirna editing regulated by intracellular signal cascades during development? extensive experimental studies are required in the future to address these questions.

previous studies showed that rasirnas and pirnas are of the same origin, yet with slight differences in the way of identification and nomenclature.  <cit> . the rasirnas were first defined as small rnas derived from repeat elements, mainly transposons, in the genome  <cit> . however, pirnas were first identified as small rnas associated with piwi proteins in germline tissues  <cit> . later studies showed that both rasirnas and pirnas are derived from repeat elements  <cit>  and serve to suppress the activity of transposable elements by guiding the epigenetic silencing of the transcription of transposable elements and by guiding the direct cleavage of transcripts of these transposons  <cit> . recently pirnas were detected in adult cerebral cortex of rat and showed altered expression after transient focal ischemia  <cit> . nearest, pirnas were reported as functional regulator of enhancing long-term synaptic facilitation through silencing creb <dig>  <cit> . here we detected a low-abundance expression of a group of pirna-like small rnas in developing cortex of rat based on the sequence mapping to reference libraries   <cit> . moreover, we observed in cortical tissues the expression of piwi-like proteins , which play important roles in the biogenesis and function of pirnas or rasirnas  <cit> , further supporting the existence of pirnas or rasirnas in brain. interestingly, recent studies showed that retrotransposable events actively happen during neurogenesis and may contribute to the diversity of neuronal phenotypes  <cit> . since we observed much higher rasirna level at early developmental stages than in the adult, an intriguing possibility is that rasirnas in developing cortex may also contribute to the maintenance of the genome stability in neural progenitor cells by suppressing the mobile elements, a potential mechanism that deserves to be further addressed by experimental studies in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
high-throughput sequencing provides a good opportunity to systematically analyze the transcriptome of small rnas of cortical tissues. in this study the use of this technique led to the quantitative clarification of the expression of a large number of previously un-detected small rnas in cortical tissues, including mirnas, rasirnas and/or pirna-like rnas, and small rnas derived from rrna, trna, snorna, snrna, and scrna. we demonstrated dynamic and stage-specific expression of a large group of known mirnas, with surprisingly profound nucleotide editing at “seed” and flanking sequences of mirnas during cortical development. in addition, we identified a group of novel mirna candidates in rat cortex with functional hints. the dataset described here will be a valuable resource for clarifying the gene regulatory network during brain development and disease.
