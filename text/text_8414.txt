BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells are pluripotent cell populations that can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell types. mouse es cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, and their capacity to either self-renew or differentiate into cells of the three germ layers; thus this cell type is a useful model to dissect the molecular regulation behind pluripotency and differentiation  <cit> . the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency is controlled by a core cluster of transcription factors, including nanog, oct <dig> and sox <dig>  the molecular mechanisms by which these factors act is complex and not completely characterized; however part of their critical activity includes the joint regulation of each other’s expression  <cit> . the pluripotent status of stem cells is maintained through high expression levels of these genes, and the downregulation of these factors accompanies and is required for cell differentiation. nanog expression levels are crucial as its forced expression is sufficient to sustain pluripotency even in the absence of extracellular signaling factors such as leukemia inhibiting factor   <cit>  which are otherwise required for stem cell maintenance.

since the groundbreaking analysis of  <cit> , the structure of the nanog-oct4-sox <dig> transcriptional regulatory network has been revised – the recently proposed models are compared in figure  <dig>  according to the current consensus, the oct4/sox <dig> dimer acts as a common transcription factor for all three genes and no autocatalytic activation of nanog takes place. high oct <dig> levels were suggested to be repressors of nanog   <cit> . more recently, the oct <dig> inducing function of nanog was questioned, while nanog was suggested to act as an autorepressor  <cit> .suggested interactions of the nanog-oct4-sox <dig> core module of transcriptional embryonic stem cell regulation. black, green, red and blue arrows represent complex formation, transcriptional activation, repression and translation, respectively. a: the symmetric model considered by chickarmane et al.  <cit> . b: the model suggested by pan et al.  <cit>  includes negative feedbacks through oct <dig>  c: the nanog autoinhibitory circuit suggested by navarro et al.  <cit> .



in the last few years it also become clear that – despite their fundamental importance – the expression of many components of the stem cell self-renewal circuitry, including nanog, is heterogeneous in a population of undifferentiated stem cells  <cit> . the heterogeneity is dynamically maintained, with individual cells exhibiting transient changes in expression levels. genes with dynamic expression in mouse es cells include growth factors, transcription factors, and signal transduction proteins  <cit> . recently galvin-burgess et al. proposed that undifferentiated es cells are in various distinct states, depending on the activity of various signal transduction pathways  <cit> . the presence of states with distinct nanog expression levels was also suggested based on statistical modeling of changes in flow-sorted populations  <cit> . conceptually, the pluripotent and differentiating states of these cells are thus not described well by a simple “on/off” switch. instead, a cell being in one of the various pluripotent states may be primed or biased in a way that influences its response to differentiation-inducing signals  <cit> .

in view of these developments, we revisit the dynamics of the core nanog transcriptional regulatory circuit. as shown in figure  <dig>  we will consider the oct4/sox <dig> dimer as a common transcription factor for all three genes, and the nanog protein to be a transcription enhancer for the sox <dig> gene. we consider four model scenarios, in which nanog either is or is not an inducer of oct <dig>  we consider the models proposed by pan et al. where high oct <dig> levels are repressors of nanog and oct <dig>  <cit> , and that of navarro et al., which includes an autorepressor feedback to nanog  <cit> . by numerical simulations we demonstrate that all these models result in a bistable, switch-like behavior. to address the observed heterogeneity in nanog expression levels, we also explore a biologically plausible scenario to couple the core circuit to extracellular signals. based on simulation results we argue that instead of an instability within the core regulatory circuit, fluctuations in nanog expression levels and associated distinct cell states are likely to be generated by stochastic autocrine feedback loops, like the one involving secreted fgfs.nanog core circuit models studied in this work. we consider the oct4/sox <dig> dimer as a common transcription factor for all three genes, and the nanog protein to be a transcription enhancer for the sox <dig> gene. we investigate model scenarios in which nanog is  or is not  an inducer of oct <dig>  furthermore, we consider further variants, such as the model proposed by pan et al. where high oct <dig> levels repress nanog
, as well as the nanog autorepressor feedback proposed by  <cit>   and a combination of nanog autorepressor feedback with oct <dig> repression .



RESULTS
model structure
to explore the nanog transcriptional regulatory network, we adopted the method of  <cit> . the production and degradation of proteins are assumed to be much slower than the assembly or dissociation of multimolecular complexes, we thus include the latter processes using a quasi steady state approximation. with these simplifications the system is governed by three differential equations of the form 
  dgdt=αgpg−δgg 

where g=nanog,oct <dig> sox <dig> are transcription factor proteins, g denotes the regulatory site of a gene g, pg is the probability of rna polymerase ii  binding to the promoter g; αg is the combined translation and transcription rate, and δg is the decay rate of the proteins. the quasi steady state approximation yields the amount of complex-bound specimen,  as a function of the concentration of free specimen . as a change in the total amount alters both the amount of free and complex-bound specimen, 
  dg+dgbound=dg1+∂gbound∂g. 

thus, 
  dg=∂gbound∂g. 

as we show in the additional file  <dig>  pg can be written in the form of 
  pg=zgonzg, 

where 
  zg=zgon+zgoff 

and the zgon and zgoff quantities are proportional to the probability of rna polymerase ii being bound or absent at locus g, respectively. if the transcription logic is limited to two factors  per locus, then for each locus g∈{nanog,oct <dig> sox2} we obtain 
  zgon=pkg,p1+∑h∈{nanog,os,oct4}hkg,hexpcg,hrt++∑h,i∈{nanog,os,oct4}hkg,hikg,iexpcg,h,irt 

and 
  zgoff=1+∑h∈{nanog,os,oct4}hkg,h+∑h,i∈{nanog,os,oct4}hkg,hikg,i. 

in the expressions  and  the equilibrium constant  of factor h to the binding site at locus g is denoted by 
  kg,h=gboundgemptyh. 

as we discuss in the additional file  <dig>  the equilibrium constants k as well as the cooperativity measures c are related to the binding energies between the transcription factors, the promoter and the rna polymerase.

the magnitude of model parameters  were set by the following considerations. the transcription and translation rates were chosen in such a way that the steady state transcription factor  concentrations are in the nanomolar range  when the promoter is fully active  <cit> . to get a functional transcriptional regulatory system, the nanomolar concentration range must be also characteristic for promoter binding affinities, which by additional file 1: eq.  translates  into binding energies around  <dig> kcal/mol. the transcription factors were assumed to work through stabilizing rnap ii binding – with protein-protein binding energies around  <dig> kcal/mol  <cit> . this binding energy is increased for cooperative, multimolecular complexes. we assume that the probability of rnap ii binding in the absence of all the transcription factors considered is very low,  kg,p≈10− <dig> 

the core network
first we consider various scenarios for the core nanog circuit  and compare their behavior. steady state system behavior was characterized by numerically obtaining intersections of nullcline planes .

our starting point is the model a, which is symmetric in the roles of sox <dig> and oct <dig> . this model exhibits bistability: there are two stable fixed points corresponding to the “on” and “off” states of the system, separated by an unstable fixed point. linear stability analysis reveals that the stable fixed points are stable nodes, thus, no oscillations are expected in their vicinity.

augmenting the model with a negative feedback through oct <dig>  as suggested by  <cit> , can be accomplished by increasing the binding affinity of the oct <dig> protein to the nanog regulatory site, and decreasing the stability of the oct4-containing rnap ii complex . we assume that the binding affinity of oct <dig> is lower than that of nanog or the oct4/sox <dig> dimer – reflecting that high concentration of oct <dig>  was needed to elicit the inhibition. once oct <dig> is bound, however, we assume a strong inhibitory effect. as suggested  <cit> , this change indeed can transform the “on” state from a stable node to a stable spiral, but only if the oct <dig> binding affinity is higher than the values characteristic for the other tfs. in such a case the fluctuations in  are of similar magnitude than that of  . as oct <dig> levels appear quite stable in mouse embryonic stem cells , in models compatible with this observation the direct oct <dig> negative feedback is unlikely to play an important role.the behavior of various signaling components during nanog fluctuations.

in model c , oct <dig> is independent of nanog activation. in such a scenario the same parameters that were used for model a yield only the “off” fixed point as oct <dig> never turns on. considering the steady presence of oct <dig> in embryonic stem cells, we argue that for this model it is reasonable to choose an increased probability for rnap ii binding to the oct <dig> locus even in the absence of sox <dig>  this choice yields a bistable system similar to that of model a.

model d  is derived from model c by adding a nanog autorepression feedback. as additional file 1: figure s1d demonstrates, this change does not alter substantially the systems dynamics as the nanog promoter activity can be obtained by scaling additional file 1: eq.  the activity of model c.

finally, we combine model d with model b to see if nanog autorepression can further promote the transformation of the “on” fixed point into a spiral. adding nanog autorepression to model b reduces the equilibrium nanog levels  according to additional file 1: eq. , which further stabilizes the fixed point. we also derived model e  by adding oct <dig> as a nanog repressor to model d. in this scenario we found the fixed point still strongly attractive: oscillations decay fast and change both nanog and oct <dig> levels to a similar extent.

this analysis of the core nanog circuit variants suggest that they are likely to behave as bistable systems. hence, the experimentally seen heterogeneity, given the stability of oct <dig> expression levels , is an unlikely consequence of the core nanog-oct4-sox <dig> dynamics. in the following we will focus on model d, as the simplest variant of the investigated networks, and functionally equivalent with the one proposed by the most recent experimental data  <cit> . this choice, however, is somewhat arbitrary as all model networks function as a bistable switch.

sensitivity of the core network to model parameters
changes in model parameter values can gradually shift the nullclines and fixed points in the phase space. as changes in nullcline positions and shapes can create or remove intersections, the presence of both the “off” and “on” states are parameter dependent.

to gauge the model’s sensitivity to parameter values, we systematically varied all of them, one-by-one, by 20% and 40%. starting the simulations from the “on” fixed point, we obtained the new steady state values under the altered parameter setting. as figure  <dig> demonstrates, most parameters effect only one molecular species directly, and the fixed point moves along a corresponding nullcline intersection line. in particular, if the “on” fixed point falls onto the saturated regime of the nullcline intersections, then the steady state concentrations of model components, such as  and  may be differently altered. for example, changing the binding energy between rnap ii and the oct4/sox <dig> dimer at the nanog promoter by 20% shifts the equilibrium nanog concentration by more than an order of magnitude more than that of oct <dig>  this observation is the basis of our explanation for nanog heterogeneity and oct <dig> homogeneity within a cell population.parameter sensitivity analysis of the “on” fixed point of the core nanog circuit.

nanog,os, the increase of binding energy of rnap ii at the nanog promoter in the presence of the oct4/sox <dig> dimer. twenty percent change in this parameter shifts the equilibrium nanog concentration by more than an order of magnitude more than that of oct <dig> . b: parameter dependence of nullclines and fixed points: the orange and cyan curves were obtained in a simulation with increased c

nanog heterogeneity
as we demonstrated above, the most plausible assumptions do not suggest the presence of substantial oscillations within the core nanog-oct4-sox <dig> system. to explain the observed broad distribution of nanog expression within a population of mouse es cells, we hypothesize that model parameters such as binding energies depend on the larger biochemical context. for example, erk activity is a known potent negative regulator of nanog transcription  <cit> . in turn, fgf signaling is capable to create an autocrine feedback using cell surface receptors that feed into the mapk pathway, and fgf activity is indeed a well established modulator of es cell heterogeneity  <cit> . nodal signaling gives an alternative possibility for an autocrine extracellular regulation of nanog, mediated through the smad family of transcription factors  <cit> .

to demonstrate that autocrine signaling loops can induce fluctuating nanog expression levels, we consider a feedback through fgfs and erk. as a particular example, we investigate a scenario in which the stability of the rnap ii complex containing the oct4/sox <dig> dimer depends on erk activation. to explore the behavior of the fgf pathway during nanog fluctuations, mouse es cells were sorted based on their nanog expression levels into four groups . for each group we determined the transcriptional activity of key genes, such as oct <dig>  esrrb, and fgf family members expressed by mouse es cells: fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  as figure  <dig> demonstrates, the range of oct <dig> variability is less than half of that of nanog. in contrast, the range of variability in the expression levels of fgfs and esrrb is even greater than that of nanog. high fgf <dig> expression is associated with high nanog expression, whereas high fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> expression is characteristic for cells with low levels of nanog. erk activity  assays revealed an inverse relationship between erk activity and nanog expression levels . this correlation between nanog expression and erk activity is seen in both sorted nanog subpopulations  and in a doxycycline-inducible nanog es cell line .

based on known regulatory binding sites  <cit> , and the expression data in figure  <dig>  we consider the autocrine feedback loop shown in figure  <dig>  using the available transcription factor-dna binding chip data set, we selected two transcriptional regulators for each gene. in particular, we assume that the klf4-esrrb system is downstream of the nanog core circuit. we suggest that nanog, klf <dig> and esrrb are activators and repressors of the two fgf genes considered in the model. finally, we assume that secreted fgf proteins bind to cell surface receptors in an autocrine manner. the activation of fgf receptors initiate the intracellular mapk signaling pathway  <cit> , which closes the feedback to nanog through modulating the binding affinities of the oct4/sox <dig> dimer, the only transcription factor of nanog explicitly considered in the model. in the following we build up this complex signaling model from simpler modules.the signaling and transcriptional network considered to regulate mouse es cell maintenance.

klf <dig> and esrrb
klf <dig> and esrrb are known to be pluripotency genes and as a recent study exposed, both are direct targets of nanog  <cit> . klf <dig> was reported to bind to it’s respective promoter as well as to the promoter regions of nanog and esrrb  <cit> . to keep our model as simple as possible, we restrict the number of regulatory connections to two per locus. we further assume that esrrb is more downstream than klf <dig> is . promoter binding affinities were chosen in such a way that  is in the nanomolar range when klf <dig> and esrrb genes switch on. with such assumptions, the nanog-klf4-esrrb cascade can function as an amplifier. by keeping  steady , the autocatalytic expression levels of klf <dig> are well approximated by a hill function of exponent  <dig> . the steady state expression level of esrrb is an even more non-linear function of : the abrupt switch is steeper than a hill function with n= <dig> . thus, consistent with empirical data, if the klf4-esrrb system is tuned in this regime of operation, changes in the transcriptional activity of esrrb may exceed by an order of magnitude that of nanog.the klf4-esrrb module as an amplifier. we consider an autocatalytic regulation of klf <dig>  and cooperative positive regulation from nanog . keeping  at various pre-determined values, we obtained the steady state concentrations and promoter activity of klf <dig> and esrrb. the relationship between these values and  is strongly non-linear, reflecting the autoregulation and cooperative binding with nanog. the solid line represent fitted hill curves with n= <dig> ± <dig>  and n= <dig> ± <dig>  for klf <dig> and esrrb, respectively . concentrations are presented in the units of nm.



autocrine fgf signaling
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the fgf <dig> gene has binding sites for klf <dig> and esrrb, and the fgf <dig> gene has sites for nanog and esrrb  <cit> . microarray expression analysis  <cit>  has shown that fgf receptor  <dig>  that can bind all three flavors of secreted fgfs, is expressed by mouse es cells. thus, we work with an aggregate autocrine fgf concentration,  to determine downstream receptor activity. as fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> expression levels appear to be similarly regulated, in our model both are represented by fgf <dig>  while the dynamics of autocrine fgf signaling has not been studied in mouse embryonic stem cells, autocrine egf signaling was explored extensively in other experimental systems  <cit> . experiments with autocrine egf signals revealed a linear relationship between cell surface autocrine ligand concentration and the production rate of the protein. thus, we assume that the equation governing autocrine fgf ligand concentration, , is 
  dfgf∗dt=∑i∈{ <dig> }αfgf-ipfgf-i−δfgf-ifgf-i1+dfgf-i 

where 0<pfgf-i< <dig> is the probability of transcription at the fgf <dig> and the fgf <dig> locus, and δfgf-i is the decay rate combined with the diffusive flux transporting the ligand off the cell surface. the αfgf-i coefficient reflects both production and the conversion between autocrine ligand concentration and production. in the egf system the relationship between steady state autocrine ligand concentration and its production rate was  <dig>  pm/ ≈  <dig>  pm/ ≈  <dig> % h . based on this result, we expect that less than 1% of the fgf molecules produced in an hour  will act as autocrine ligands at the cell surface. therefore, providing autocrine ligand concentration in the nanomolar range requires higher production rates than the rates we assumed for transcription factors .

the mapk cascade, the signaling pathway downstream of the fgf receptor, has been studied extensively both by computational and biochemical methods  <cit> . these studies revealed two characteristic operation mode: changes in receptor ligation may elicit a transient and a sustained erk activity. interestingly, both responses are well approximated by a linear response function. since the characteristic lifetime of the transient response is in the order of minutes, we assume that the relatively slow changes in nanog expression that take place over several hours reflect a sustained change in steady state erk activation. our experimental data  is also consistent with a change in the steady state erk activity. hence, we propose that the normalized difference 
  ε=erk∗−erk∗0erk∗ <dig> 

between erk activity  and a reference  level activity  <dig> is proportional to the number of active receptor complexes r∗ as 
  ε∼r∗. 

the steady state concentration of active receptors is 
  r∗=rtotfgf∗1/k+fgf∗, 

where rtot is the total amount of fgf receptors at the cell surface, and k is the binding constant between the receptors and their fgf ligands.

the connection between erk activity and nanog activation is currently unknown. here we assume, that the regulation involves the modulation of the binding affinity of the oct4/sox <dig> dimer, the only transcription factor of nanog that is explicitly considered in the model: 
  cnanog,os−cnanog,os∼ε, 

thus 
  cnanog,os−cnanog,os=artotfgf∗1/k+fgf∗ 

where the coupling factor a is chosen in such a way that for a typical simulation the magnitude of  is smaller than one.

nanog expression determined by autocrine feedback
to explore the behavior of the full model , we first consider steady states obtained with various  values of cnanog,os, the binding energy between rnap ii and the oct4/sox <dig> dimer at the nanog promoter – the assumed site of erk regulation . when cnanog,os is set by the feedback  with a specific “gain” parameter a, the system reaches a single steady state that falls on the steady state curves shown in figure  <dig>  we propose that the observed nanog heterogeneity is resulted by slow alterations in model parameters – specific for individual cells – like the feedback strength or the efficiency of autocrine ligand capture. for strong enough autocrine feedbacks the system is characterized by a fold in the phase space , hence small changes in the parameter values can have disproportionally large effects on the steady state concentration values. furthermore, due to the hysteresis distinct sub-states can co-exist , hence the concentration values also reflect the history of the system. all these sub-states are, however, still within the “on” state of the nanog core circuit: the parameters identified in figure  <dig>  like the the binding affinity of nanog to the sox <dig> promoter, are still able to shut off nanog expression through another sudden change . to address the robustness of the substates, we performed a systematic variation of model components by 10%. we found, that when both distinct “on” and “off” states were present, the “on” state exhibited substates separated by a bistable region in 85% of the cases.the effects of modulating the transcriptional regulation of

large fluctuations readily develop as a response to a high frequency noise added to the parameters. as an example, a 30% modulation of the fgf decay parameter δfgf results in slow, but large amplitude transitions between the substates : the model-predicted duration of a transition is in the order of a day, and the typical time of the system spends in the same substate is in the order of a week. such simulations also allow to correlate expression levels in the model with experimental data shown in figure  <dig>  in the time series we identified regimes where  was below  <dig>  nm  or above  <dig>  nm . fow both types of time intervals we averaged the expression level of each factor, and normalized it to the “nanog high” state . the general tendencies of both figure 9d and figure  <dig> are identical: nanog expression levels are more variable than that of oct <dig>  and the klf4-esrrb amplifier can further increase the variability in fgf expression.fluctuations in protein concentrations and gene expression driven by a noise. fluctuations in protein concentrations  and gene expression , driven by a noise  added to the autocrine ligand decay parameter δ

discussion
the mechanism behind nanog fluctuations
protein and mrna levels can fluctuate due to the inherently stochastic kinetics of gene transcription and translation. even an unregulated, constitutively expressed gene exhibits a 30% spread of expression levels over a population of identical cells  <cit> . clearly, the reported variations in the stem cell maintenance network, especially those genes that are downstream of nanog, greatly exceed this baseline variability. thus, we expect that the observed heterogeneity in nanog expression levels is generated by the dynamics of the regulatory system as it greatly amplifies the molecular stochastic noise. to describe a potential mechanism generating the experimentally observed dynamics, we proposed a model that operates with binding affinities of multiple transcriptional regulators of pluripotency, the topology of the transcriptional regulatory networks, and activity of an autocrine signaling pathway. the resulting model produces varied expression levels of several components of pluripotency regulation, largely consistent with our  and previously reported empirical observations  <cit> .

we argue that slow fluctuations in nanog expression likely reflect individual cell-specific changes in parameters of an autocrine feedback loop, such as changes in ligand capture efficiency, receptor numbers or the presence of crosstalks within the mapk signal transduction pathway. while high-frequency variability may be filtered out by the slow dynamics of transcription factor synthesis and accumulation, low frequency changes, such as a slow alteration in the cell’s microenvironment, are capable to push expression levels across substate boundaries. given the complexities of a cell’s variable exposure to autocrine/juxtacrine signaling in culture, this model incorporates a plausible basis for a variable activity of an autocrine signaling pathway eliciting heterogeneous expression of intracellular components. in this view the fluctuations of nanog reflect the response of a regulatory system with multiple feedbacks in a non-stationary environment.

this feedback mechanism, that does not involve changes in oct <dig>  is consistent with both the stability of oct <dig> expression levels  <cit> ,  and the observation that alteration of oct <dig> levels induces es cells to differentiate rapidly; too much or too little oct <dig> rapidly directs cells to differentiate  <cit> . very small increases in oct <dig> expression causes differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm, and reduction of oct <dig> levels induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation to trophectoderm.

comparison with experimental data
the proposed computational model needs to be compared with experimental data on at least three levels.  the dynamics of the whole system can be evaluated and compared with corresponding experimental data.  our model makes explicit or implicit assumptions on the topology of the transcriptional regulatory network, and identifies functional modules. finally,  most model parameters are expressed either as molecular binding affinities or as parameters effecting the stability of the transcription complex in addition to production and decay rates.

dynamics
our model calculations demonstrate that a biologically plausible autocrine feedback can create distinct sub-states within the “on” state of the core nanog switch. while stochasticity and feedback regulation has been proposed to explain nanog fluctuations  <cit> , the previously proposed mechanisms involved noise induced transitions between the “on” and “off” states of the core nanog switch. experimental evidence, however, suggests that nanog expression in nanog-low es cells is still much higher than that in cells committed to differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, nanog-low cells can still be maintained indefinitely without committing to differentiation – their nanog expression level will, in fact, increase. these empirical observations clearly support a mechanism that operates with transitions between substates that do not involve the “off” state of the core nanog switch. the existence of distinct substates of nanog expression was also suggested by a recent study that analyzed experimentally observed changes in nanog expression profiles in terms of a phenomenological model that made no explicit assumptions on the underlying molecular signaling network  <cit> .

our approach also demonstrates that the slow modulation of nanog expression can reflect changes that are external to the core circuit – instead of the stochastic expression of the transcription factors  <cit> . the topology of the regulatory network considered here is more elaborated than in previous studies  <cit> , and thus able to represent and predict changes in expression of several downstream genes. furthermore, our model does not include direct autoregulation of nanog – a frequent assumption in simplified models which lacks empirical support.

fgf and nodal signaling are clearly active in mouse embryonic stem cells, and function in an autocrine fashion in undifferentiated cells  <cit> . previous studies  <cit>  have shown that these autocrine signaling pathways influence the dynamic heterogeneity of es cells in culture, likely through specific molecular mechanisms that have yet to be elaborated. our results show highly variable expression of fgf ligands and intracellular erk activity in es cells grown in serum-based media . the model behavior presented in figure  <dig>  is largely consistent with the anticorrelation found in erk activity and nanog expression  as well as existing information on fgf signaling  <cit> .

regulatory network topology
the regulatory network shown in figure  <dig> contains motifs that are well established as well as hypothetical regulatory connections that we explore in this work. the full network can be broken up into four modules: the core nanog switch, the downstream esrrb amplifier, the autocrine fgf module and finally, the feedback through the mapk cascade.

our analysis indicates that each of the recently proposed regulatory architecture of the core nanog-oct4-sox <dig> network  functions as a bistable switch. we argue, that irrespective of the underlying model details, the nonlinearity needed to create two stable fixed points is provided by the autoregulation and the dimerization of the oct4/sox <dig> transcription factors. the switch-like behavior is also maintained when oct <dig> acts as a likely low affinity repressor – an assumption motivated by the finding that oct <dig> overexpression was required for the manifestation of the repressive behavior  <cit> .

the roles klf <dig> and esrrb play in stem cell maintenance are in the focus of recent scientific interest  <cit> . based on chromatin immunoprecipitation data  <cit> , both the klf <dig> and esrrb genes have several potential regulatory sites, which include transcription factors from the nanog core as well as allow autoregulatory feedbacks. we demonstrated that a subset of the known likely regulatory interactions is capable to function as an amplifier, greatly expanding the variability of these factors. while the existence of  autoregulation in these loci has not yet been established by targeted experiments, the proposed amplifier function of the klf4-esrrb system is in good agreement with the experimentally obtained large variations in esrrb  and downstream fgf expression levels .

the fgf genes which are known to be actively transcribed in mouse es cells exhibit regulatory sites for the transcription factors considered in this work. chromatin immunoprecipitation data reveals that fgf <dig> has putative regulatory sites for klf <dig> and esrrb, fgf <dig> has putative regulatory sites for nanog and esrrb, while fgf <dig> exhibits a regulatory site for nanog  <cit> . while the nature of the regulatory connection is currently unknown, based on the strong correlation between nanog and fgf <dig> expression and the strong anticorrelation between nanog and fgf <dig> as well as nanog and fgf <dig> expression levels, we assume that fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> are repressed while fgf <dig> expression is enhanced by the transcription factors considered in this work. the repressional regulation of fgf genes is of key importance – it yields a negative feedback loop, and this will tested by targeted experiments in the future.

finally, the mapk module and the autocrine ligand concentration was treated phenomenologically by simplified input-output relationships reflecting previously established results. in particular, we postulated a linear relationship between autocrine ligand concentration and its rate of production  <cit> . the mapk pathway can exhibit transient and sustained activation  <cit> , the latter lasting only for less than an hour  <cit> . as changes in transcriptional regulation are operating on a slower time scale, here we considered a change in sustained erk activation, which was also carefully studied and is expected to operate as an amplifier  linking input and output with a hill coefficient much greater than one  <cit> . this observation motivates our use of a coupling factor a in eq.  that is able to substantially reduce nanog expression, in agreement with specific observations in mouse es cells  <cit> .

a molecular regulatory network model is bound to have several parameters, for most of which very little empirical data is available. as one way to contain this problem, here we used a modular approach: first we identified the behavior of smaller units, like the core nanog switch, or the esrrb amplifier. functional requirements can considerably constrain the possible parameter values within such a module. as a second effort to reduce the arbitrariness of model parameters we derived expression rates from binding energies  <cit> . finally, unless empirical evidence suggested otherwise, we kept the simplest  values of the parameters and did not try to match empirical data by fine tuning the parameters. nevertheless, we do not consider our parameters to be predictive – many different combinations can give similar overall behavior. yet, they are important to demonstrate that the proposed regulatory system can work with plausible parameter values.

future directions
the major focus of this model involves a regulatory network of nanog, oct <dig>  and sox2; these transcriptional regulators constitute a semi-independent regulatory module  in maintaining pluripotency. clearly many other transcriptional regulators are involved in this complex module however. our model represents an extensible platform for adding further components of the core module. the integration of other transcriptional regulators such as tcf <dig>  <cit> , tbx <dig>  <cit> , and signaling pathways such as nodal and bmp signaling  <cit> , will be an important future application of this model to study the inherent instability of the pluripotent phenotype in serum-based media. the model presented here does not take into account potential role of allelic expression of the nanog locus  <cit>  in directing heterogeneity in nanog expression. experimental data for this phenomenon are contradictory, however,  <cit> . further experimental data will be required to confirm this phenomenon, and if so, how this unusual mode of transcriptional regulation may be integrated into the model presented here.

CONCLUSIONS
the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells is sustained by a core cluster of co-regulated transcription factors, nanog, oct <dig> and sox <dig>  surprisingly, nanog as well as several other downstream transcription factors exhibit widely fluctuating expression in a population of undifferentiated stem cells. to explain the observed heterogeneity of expression levels, we propose a computational model that couples the transcriptional regulation of nanog to autocrine extracellular signals. we argue that the likely source of fluctuations is not the core regulatory cluster, but stochasticity within the autocrine feedback loops. the model predicts fluctuating expression levels for several factors involved in pluripotency maintenance, largely consistent with empirical observations presented here or reported previously. our model indicates the presence of distinct substates of pluripotency, each exhibiting various expression levels of nanog and downstream transcription or signaling factors. thus, we predict that subpopulations within undifferentiated embryonic stem cells can have non-uniform responses to extracellular stimuli. finally, we assign an empirically testable function to the transcriptional regulators klf <dig> and esrrb, and predict differential regulation of fgf family members. in vivo, we expect autocrine feedbacks to be highly sensitive to alterations of the stem cell microenvironment, hence our model can guide future studies linking stem cell maintenance to physical and biochemical properties of the stem cell niche.
