BACKGROUND
specific binders to the virus surface protein hemagglutinin  are of interest for influenza diagnosis as well as for therapy. besides sialylglycoconjugates and antibodies
 <cit> , sialic acid mimicking peptides have also the potential as high affinity binders
 <cit> . in the present study, we used the advantages of peptide amphiphiles  for influenza virus detection, in particular for the h5n <dig> virus. influenza a virus subtype h5n <dig>  commonly called “bird flu”, is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with high death rates - 100% mortality of the birds within  <dig> hours
 <cit> . it was first detected in  <dig> in guangdong 
 <cit> . the virus does not only infect a large number of poultry but also increasing numbers of human beings, often with fatal consequences.

the influenza virus infection occurs by an attachment of its surface protein hemagglutinin to the host cell. the protein represents a homotrimeric lectin and appears at high concentrations on the surface of the virus, with 600– <dig> molecules per virus particle
 <cit> . furthermore, the ha is also responsible for the viral binding, allowing the infiltration into the host cell through endocytosis and subsequently the fusion of the membranes. ha binds to the sialic acid  terminal residues of glycoproteins and lipids of the host cell surface. the interaction consists of a multivalent binding
 <cit>  to gain stability and to prevent the dissociation of the virus. the association constant for the single sa molecule to a single ha receptor is relatively weak with  <dig> m- <dig>  but the binding between viral receptor and cellular sa increases substantially as characterized by a multivalent affinity constant of estimated  <dig> m- <dig> <cit> . the receptor binding site describes a pocket like cavity and is located on the distal end of the molecule
 <cit> , whereby this region is known to be highly conserved in all strains of the virus
 <cit> .

matsubara et al.
 <cit>  researched for an alternative of sialic acid in order to inhibit the internalization of h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> influenza virus into host cells and their efforts were rewarded with a minimum peptide sequence arlpr showing a good inhibitory activity . a docking simulation involving the proposed minimum sequence in the receptor binding pocket of ha showed, that the side chains of the amino acids of the peptide utilized the same hydrogen bonds and van-der-waals interactions to ha as the natural binder sialic acid
 <cit> .

via solid phase peptide synthesis 
 <cit>  it is possible to efficiently produce peptides with corresponding high purity. this approach provides a precise control over the molecular structure and enables simultaneously an easy manipulation by chemical modification. in the concept of this study, functional peptides were designed as more potent peptide ligands with an n-terminal alkyloyl chain, which in turn promotes a self-assembly into highly ordered structures in aqueous phase. thus modified peptides exhibit the morphology and behaviour of peptide amphiphiles and hence the combined characteristics of both - the biological activity of the peptides as well as the properties of surfactants such as ctab  or sds . peptide amphiphiles are built up of a hydrophobic segment, generally a single-
 <cit>  or a double-alkyl tail
 <cit> , and a hydrophilic biologically active peptide headgroup with the capability of self-assembly. the hydrophobic chains allow the monomers to form molecular aggregates in solution based on the hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon chains. these aggregate states can emulate the folding of the peptides simulating their native secondary structure. it can be visualized as an interaction between the hydrocarbon chains in the core and the resulting complementary alignment of the peptides in the corona as described by israelachvili et al.
 <cit> . the pa building blocks arrange in well-defined and reproducible structures such as micelles, bilayers, vesicles, spheres or cylinders with the peptides oriented in an organized and functional way. their applications range from diagnostic tools
 <cit>  over therapeutic approaches
 <cit> , drug delivery systems
 <cit>  to functional biomaterials
 <cit> . with this molecular set-up the penetration through cell membranes is much better and the accessibility of the peptides to receptors enhanced.

to analyse the specific interactions between ha and the peptide amphiphiles we developed a rapid and highly sensitive method using a surface plasmon resonance system . this label-free and real-time optical detection method is a well established characterisation module
 <cit>  for biomolecular interactions of proteins
 <cit> , oligosaccharides, pathogens
 <cit> , cells and lipids up to smaller molecules. spr-based measurements are sensitive to refractive index changes and correlates with the mass of the immobilised ligand. the surface coverage by binding is measured in resonance units , the signal follows the binding in real-time during the association and dissociation process. the spr measurements provides detailed insights into the mechanism of the interaction between the peptide amphiphile micelles as multivalent ligands and the ha receptor. the sensor surface could be regenerated and allows multiple use of the same chip for subsequent analyses with a good repeatability.

these advantages of the spr technique enable us to analyse the kinetics of the interaction of the soluble pas to the hemagglutinin of the pathogen h5n <dig> . in addition, to evaluate the properties of the newly developed pas, for instance the critical micelle concentration  or colloidal size, could be determined. surfactants start to form micelles from a critical concentration on, called cmc. for the identification of the cmc, different physicochemical characteristics can be used considering the pa concentration. there are several properties of surfactant solutions which exhibit a break point in the concentration dependence: electric conductivity, osmotic pressure, interfacial tension, turbidity or surface tension
 <cit> . in this study surface tension measurements were utilized to determine the cmc.

besides the concentration of micelles, size plays also an important role. light scattering methods such as static light scattering  and dynamic light scattering  are the most efficient techniques of micelle size and shape measurement. the dls has verified to be a rapid and precise method for sizing particles in a nanometre range
 <cit> . the technique is based on time-resolved analysis of the brownian motion, small molecules moving faster than large molecules, which causes a doppler shift of the incident laser light frequency.

in the present study biophysical methods such as spr will be used to examine the effect of micelle formation of palmitoyl peptides with binding to the receptor binding site of the virus surface protein ha.

RESULTS
peptide amphiphile synthesis
our initial investigations showed that the binding between hemagglutinin  and the unmodified peptides , which were selected from literature
 <cit> , is very difficult to determine. the response signals were barely distinguishable from the background and the evaluation was almost impossible. thus, a method is required to enhance the signal and its sensitivity. the solution seems to be the use of an amphiphilic peptide with a polyvalent display of biofunctional peptides
 <cit> . matsubara et al.
 <cit>  did some cell tests with n-stearoyl peptides  with excellent inhibition effects up to  <dig> percent. in figure 
1a a schematic presentation of our pa's and their micellar character is illustrated. to identify which sequence length of the peptide is sufficient for our spr studies the 15mer l <dig> and the 8mer m <dig> as a middle sized ligand were utilised in addition to the required 5mer minimum sequence s <dig> . different n-terminal modifications were performed to identify the best possible ligand for ha. a pegylation of the peptides or a dimeric structure showed no improvements in the binding activity . the modification with a palmitic acid residue has been reported to indicate promising results in this context
 <cit> . using the solid phase peptide synthesis , the peptide sequence was built up stepwise and the preactivated palmitic acid was coupled in the last step to the n-terminus of the peptide sequence. the conjugated fatty acid supplies the hydrophobic driving force for a self-assembly in solution. the three synthesized palmitoyl peptides are shown in table 
 <dig> 

to analyse the effect of the modification for the ha binding behaviour, the hemagglutinin h <dig> was immobilised as ligand to the spr sensor chip surface.

spr measurements
immobilisation of ha from h5n1
the ha  was immobilised on an activated carboxymethylated -dextran sensor surface via the biacore® standard activation protocol
 <cit>  and in connection with a ph  <dig> immobilisation buffer. a low ha concentration in combination with a longer injection time was more efficient than higher concentrations at lower injection times. otherwise the individual ha’s would interfere each other and no adequate loading of the surface can be observed. under these conditions, about  <dig> response units  could be achieved from the immobilised ligand to the flow cell. as control for the ha immobilisation, the monoclonal h5n <dig> antibody was used. at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml, a distinct response signal at the binding flow cell was detected. the immobilisation of ha was successful and the accessibility of hemagglutinin was warranted.

palmitoyl peptides as multivalent binding partner
to obtain more data on the peptide - hemagglutinin interaction, the biacore instrumentation provided the most suitable “real-time biospecific interaction” analysis platform
 <cit> . the binding experiments were performed with an increasing pa concentration and with the various peptide sequences. the unmodified peptides and the pa's were successively injected and analysed by biacore evaluation software and reproducible binding results for three times were observed . both, the peptides and pas offered a expected binding profile of a spr measurement with the association process, where the peptides and micelles interact with the immobilised hemagglutinin. this results in a characteristic binding equilibrium, which generally approaches a plateau. the peptides have the characteristic feature of being rather weak binders with a low-affinity interaction  and may dissociate quickly. the sensorgram of the dissociation process for the unmodified peptide l <dig> is shown in figure 
 <dig>  a regeneration step was not necessary. in contrast, the control flow cell, where no ha was immobilised, showed no significant signal changes .

figure 
 <dig> shows the dependence of the sensor signal  on concentration. the high increase in signal response from  <dig> to  <dig> μm peptide concentration is remarkable, this couldn't be observed by the unmodified peptides. also in the next figure  this concentration dependence is given for the three different peptide amphiphiles. slight signals were detected in the lower concentration range of  <dig> to  <dig> μm. when the concentration of pa's was augmented to  <dig> μm, a sharp increase in the response units was recorded. the signals moved forward to saturation at  <dig> μm , whereas pal m <dig> still slightly rose at this concentration and has not yet reached its maximum. the binding of pal m <dig> in the upper concentration range was difficult to evaluate and measurements above the concentration of  <dig> μm peptide were necessary.

pal l <dig> initially achieved constant response units at about  <dig> ru. this peptide has the biggest head group and shows a characteristic binding curve. the curves of pal m <dig> and pal s <dig> are distinguished by a steep slope. the starting concentration for the binding is in correlation to the micelle formation . pal l <dig> has a small cmc and began binding to ha at the lowest concentration. the binding of ha requires higher concentrations of pal m <dig> and pal s <dig> to initiate this process.

figure 
4b shows the binding curve of the unmodified peptide l <dig> in comparison to the palmitoyl peptide pal l <dig>  at a concentration of  <dig> μm, the signals of pal l <dig> were about tenfold higher than the unmodified one. as a control, we also designed a pa with no binding activity to ha, but with the capability to assemble into micelles. this negative control showed no quantitative measurable signal changes  and thereby demonstrated the specificity of the tested pa's. in addition, the binding capacities of m <dig> and s <dig> were comparably lower . these small affinities of the unmodified peptides were to be expected. chang and co-worker observed that linear peptides are low-affinity ligands, which do not have a distinct conformation in solution. the corresponding cyclic peptides bound 1000-fold firmer than their linear counterpart
 <cit> , because the peptides were constrained by cyclisation and lose their conformational freedom. correspondingly, the entropy of such unbound peptides is reduced
 <cit> . this entropy decrease is also achieved by an arrangement into a micelle. it enhances the binding affinity to ha and shows high binding signals in the sensorgrams. this pa arrangement can be used as diagnostic tool similar to guler et al.
 <cit> , where they designed a biotinylated peptide amphiphile for enhanced recognition by the avidin receptor or where bull et al.
 <cit>  utilized, a peptide amphiphile to raise the relaxivity of magnetic resonance imaging agents. different peptide amphiphile constellations represent a promising way of functionalising biomaterial interfaces.

the calculation of the kinetic data is rather difficult, due to the multivalent binding mode of assembled micelles
 <cit> . it is not known, how many free binding sites of peptides are available at the surface of each micelle. so far, there is no satisfactory description of the binding, only some promising approaches could be found in literature
 <cit> . therefore, further investigations and evaluations seem to be necessary.

inhibition test
to demonstrate the specificity of the micelle binding, a competitive inhibition assay was performed by using the unmodified peptide in excess. the pa was added at constant concentration of  <dig> μm to a mixture with rising quantity of the corresponding unmodified peptide. this resulted in a competition for the same binding site. the corresponding spr sensorgrams are shown in figure 
 <dig>  the binding of pal l <dig> to the h5-modified sensor surface is described by a typical binding curve . in the presence of  <dig>  mm peptide l <dig> an enhancement was detectable for the binding of l <dig>  with an excess of l <dig> the maximum response rose again, but without significant differences to the signal without pal l <dig>  the results clearly show that an inhibition of pal l <dig> is possible. at a concentration of  <dig> mm l <dig> the binding capacity is up to  <dig> percent lower . the interaction to h <dig> can be analysed by applying pa and the specificity of the binding was not affected by self-assembly.

for a more precise characterisation of the properties of the new pas, the micelle size, shape and micelle building concentration were determined.

micelle characterization
the incorporation of a long alkyl chain to the peptides resulted in a surfactant like behaviour. it allows even peptides that normally do not self-assemble to form stable aggregates. not only self-assembly can be induced via the attachment of alkyl-tails, also the orientation of the secondary structure can be changed for stabilising a peptide in its bioactive conformation
 <cit> .

the aggregation behaviour of amphiphilic peptides in aqueous solution was determined by surface tension measurements. a characteristic curve of the surface tension as a function of the surfactant concentration is illustrated in figure 
1b. in aqueous solution, the palmitoyl peptide molecules are present as monomers and form a monolayer film at the air-water interface. with increasing pa concentration, the monolayer adsorption becomes complete and an abrupt change indicates the critical micelle concentration  of the pa. at this point, the formation of thermodynamically stable aggregates, called micelles, starts. concentrations above the cmc result in constant surface tension values according to the adsorption-isotherm of gibbs. any increase in the peptide concentration does not affect the number of monomers, but influences the number and shape of the micelles
 <cit> , and the transformation into bigger lamellar, hexagonal or cubic assemblies.

in the present work the equilibrium surface tension of the pa solution was analysed by a drop profile analysis tensiometer at different concentrations. figure 
 <dig> shows the equilibrium surface tension in dependence on pa concentration. the surface tension decreases from  <dig>  mn/m  with increasing pa concentration and remains constant from a certain concentration on at a surface tension of  <dig> mn/m. this distinctive concentration is the above-mentioned critical micelle concentration of the pa and initiates the aggregation into micelles.

the cmc value is determined by a linear fitting of the two data subsets and calculating the concentration at their intersection. the surface tension data correlate to the behaviour of an ionic surfactant with a cmc of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m. the values of pal s <dig>  pal m <dig> and pal l <dig> do not really delineate to a straight line beyond the cmc - the surface tension further on slightly decreases. this means an indication of the commencing of the aggregation to bigger micelles, rods or disks like the cylindric form in figure 
1b. further investigations by cyro-tem micrographs could give more informations about the morphology of the micelles. the cmc values  are conform with the spr measurements. this becomes apparent for example in the strong increase in binding signal between  <dig> and  <dig> μm , which precisely matches the cmc value with  <dig> μm. at this stage, the micelle formation begins and a multivalent binder is available for the ha interaction. the signal increases and the micelles grow further. at a certain point, no more micelles are formed and a shape change can be observed, which is indicated by the slight decrease of surface tension at higher concentrations  and the saturation level as depicted in the spr binding curves .

similar to buckingham et al.
 <cit> , the cmc of the pa's depends also on the size of the head group and decreases with increasing size of the peptide sequence . probably the behaviour is also controlled by the hydrophobic part, as the cmc decreases with longer chains. this is caused by the tendency of hiding the hydrophobic parts of surfactant molecule in an aqueous environment
 <cit> . with increasing peptide length the hydrophobicity increases and more peptide bonds are available for hydrogen bonding.

the ha trimers are located on the surface of the influenza virus with a distance of  <dig> nm. the individual receptors of the monomers are separated  <dig> nm from each other
 <cit> . dynamic light scattering  measurements were carried out to provide information about the shape and size of the pa micelles, to clarify whether the pas are large enough for the described binding distances. the determination was done at a concentration of  <dig> μm above the respective cmc. the size distribution showed colloidal structures of  <dig> nm in diameter and a broader peak between  <dig> and  <dig> nm . with this result, the pas supply excellent counterparts for the ha detection. a diameter of  <dig> nm is sufficient for the receptor binding site. ideally one micelle could bind to one ha trimer, where the receptor binding sites of each monomer have a distance of  <dig> nm. the larger micelles have the ability to connect with several ha trimers.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present work successfully describes the interaction between short peptides and virus surface protein with a spr binding method. the biological activity and specificity of the peptides could be increased by n-terminal modification. in solution, these modified peptides showed amphiphile behaviour and formed micelles. with such structural constellation, multiple binding sites for improved affinities are available, resulting in corresponding amplified detection signals. it is therefore possible to utilise peptides efficiently in a controlled environment, while considering the values of the critical micelle concentration and the size distribution of the peptide amphiphile association structures. peptides - arranged in such a controlled micellar alignment - provide the possibility of interaction with multiple binding partners. prospective applications could be the use as diagnostic tool for protein recognition in combination with a dye-based detection system. upon successful binding of the micelle and the consequent release of the dye from inside of the micelle would be provided an elegant strategy to monitor the interaction.
