BACKGROUND
common bean  is the most important grain legume for direct human consumption in the world. this crop, a major source of dietary protein, minerals and certain vitamins, plays a significant role in human nutrition particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries  <cit> . the annotated common bean genome sequence was released in  <dig> . more recently, transcriptome analysis in common bean using high-throughput sequencing of rna transcripts  has provided data on gene expression profiles in different tissues  at different development stages . these recent advances have successfully resulted in the identification of a large number of genes. to assign functions to these genes and to relate these to agronomically important traits, there is now a critical need for functional genomics tools, enabling for instance reverse genetics strategies in common bean. unfortunately, although genetic transformation of common bean is feasible, it has a low transformation efficiency, and is therefore not suitable for high-throughput functional genomics .

virus-induced gene silencing  is an attractive tool for functional genomics in plants. vigs technology relies on the ability of plant viruses to trigger a host defense mechanism related to post-transcriptional gene silencing . vigs requires the construction of a recombinant virus carrying a fragment of a specific endogenous gene that will be targeted by ptgs and thus be down-regulated  <cit> . the delivery procedure of the viral vector into plants  is a critical step in vigs technology. it can be achieved by various techniques such as agrobacterium-mediated infiltration , mechanical inoculation of in-vitro transcribed rna, or biolistic delivery of infectious plasmid dna   <cit> . these delivery methods may be impractical for large-scale vigs studies  <cit> . in recent years, several research groups have developed a method of inoculation using direct dna rubbing of infectious dna plasmids, thus precluding the need for in vitro transcription, biolistic delivery, or agro-inoculation procedures  <cit> .

vigs has proven to be an easy and rapid way to study the function of genes in many plant species . to date, vigs vectors have been developed in legumes from several plant viruses, such as the apple latent spherical virus , the pea early browning virus , and the bean pod mottle virus  . among these, bpmv has been the most widely used vigs vector, and has been used mainly in soybean  to assess the function of disease resistance genes  <cit>  and defense genes involved in plant-microbe interactions  <cit> . bpmv is a positive-strand rna virus of the genus comovirus from the family comoviridae. bpmv was first discovered in common bean  <cit> , but was subsequently shown to infect many other legume species such as soybean  <cit> . the genome of bpmv is bipartite, with two rna molecules rna <dig>  and rna <dig>  that are encapsidated in separate isometric particles. rna <dig> and rna <dig> are expressed as polyproteins that are subsequently processed by proteinases for the synthesis of mature viral proteins. bpmv rna <dig> has been shown to carry the pathogenicity component that determines foliar symptom severity  <cit> .

in soybean, three generations of bpmv vigs vectors have been successively developed by zhang and ghabrial  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit> , with the aim of increasing the potential of bpmv as a viral vector for functional genomics  <cit> . in all three vectors, insertion of foreign dna fragments for vigs induction and/or gene expression is made in rna <dig>  the third-generation bpmv-derived vector, recently designed in soybean by zhang et al.  <cit> , presents important improvements compared to previous generations. first, cloning of foreign sequences into bpmv rna <dig> is facilitated by the introduction of a bamh <dig> restriction site after the translation stop codon of rna <dig> to overcome the necessity of cloning foreign sequences in the same reading frame as the rna <dig> polyprotein. second, delivery of the bpmv vector into plants is possible via direct dna rubbing of infectious plasmid dna, a procedure adapted to high-throughput studies. third, this bpmv vector is derived from the ia-di <dig> isolate which induces very mild visual symptoms on infected soybean plants, thus avoiding possible interference between viral symptoms and silencing phenotypes. all these improvements make this new bpmv vector an ideal ‘one-step’ viral vector . this vector is adapted to high-throughput genomic studies and has enabled efficient, cost-effective, and simplified functional screening of genes in soybean  <cit> .

the ‘one-step’ bpmv vector has been shown to infect common bean cv. black valentine  <cit> . three weeks post-inoculation  of common bean plants with a bpmv-green fluorescent protein  construct, extensive green fluorescence was visible in the upper systemic leaves and roots of infected plants  <cit> . to date, only one vigs study has been reported in common bean using the first generation bpmv vector  <cit> . common bean genes encoding nodulin  <dig> and stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase were successfully silenced in cv. black valentine  <cit> . however, use of this first generation bpmv vector is limited to low-throughput vigs studies mainly because  foreign sequences must be cloned in-frame into the rna <dig> polyprotein and  delivery into plants is achieved by viral rnas transcribed in vitro from the bpmv constructs.

with the goal of adapting the ‘one-step’ bpmv vector for high-throughput vigs studies in common bean, we first aimed to optimize the conditions for rub-inoculation of infectious bpmv-derived plasmids in common bean cv. black valentine. secondly, we investigated the susceptibility to bpmv of several common bean genotypes of interest: in particular the g <dig> and bat <dig> genotypes for which complete genome sequences are available. we then describe the spatial and temporal infection patterns of bpmv in vegetative and reproductive tissues. in addition, gene silencing of the phytoene desaturase  marker gene was tested with recombinant bpmv vectors carrying fragments of increasing size to determine the minimum insert length required for efficient pvpds silencing. finally, as the phenotype of resistance to bpmv was polymorphic between the two parental lines of a population of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  used to set up the integrated linkage map of common bean  <cit> , we aimed to investigate the segregation of resistance to bpmv in this rils population using a bpmv-gfp construct, with the aim of mapping the corresponding gene.

RESULTS
optimal conditions for direct rub-inoculation of infectious bpmv-derived plasmids in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine
three parameters were optimized for the delivery of infectious bpmv-derived plasmids by rub-inoculation in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine: plasmid quantity, intensity of mechanical rubbing, and number of inoculated primary leaves. we evaluated the efficiency of direct rub-inoculation of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine seedlings using two constructs: the empty bpmv vigs vector  and the vector expressing gfp  . the bpmv- <dig> and bpmv-gfp constructs were introduced into plants by rub-inoculation of primary leaves using a mix of bpmv rna <dig> and rna <dig> infectious plasmids. delivery efficiency was estimated by visual inspection of viral symptoms and detection of green fluorescence under uv light for the bpmv- <dig> and bpmv-gfp constructs respectively.table  <dig>

optimal plasmid quantity was determined using the bpmv- <dig> vector. to assess infection success, we used the pbpmv-ia-r1m plasmid carrying a mutated rna <dig> as it is known to induce obvious moderate symptoms upon inoculation with pbpmv-ia-v <dig> compared with the symptomless wt rna <dig>  allowing the identification of infected plants by a simple visual inspection at  <dig> dpi  <cit> . we compared the number of plants displaying viral symptoms at  <dig> dpi after rub-inoculation with different quantities of rna1- and rna2-derived plasmids. in two independent experiments, 92%-100% of plants exhibited viral symptoms when inoculated with a plasmid dna mix containing 5 μg of each plasmid, compared with 17% and 33% of those inoculated with  <dig>  μg or 3 μg of each plasmid respectively . consequently, all further experiments were carried out using 5 μg of rna1- and 5 μg of rna2-derived plasmids. we also investigated whether rubbing intensity and the number of primary leaves inoculated  affected the infection rate in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine. we found that high-intensity rubbing  resulted in injured areas on the upper leaf surface and no visible signs of infection at  <dig> dpi. plants inoculated using low- or medium-intensity rubbing resulted in better infection rates . there was no significant difference in the number of infected plants after rub-inoculation of either one or two primary leaves . therefore, the optimal conditions for direct rub-inoculation in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine were defined as: 5 μg of each rna1- and rna2-derived plasmid in a 20 μl mock buffer solution, and medium-intensity rubbing on one of the two primary leaves per plant.table  <dig>

to determine whether the insertion of a foreign gene fragment in bpmv rna <dig> could affect the infection efficiency of bpmv during primary inoculation of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine, we used the bpmv-gfp vector which has a 720 bp fragment corresponding to the full-length gfp orf inserted in rna <dig>  <cit> . seedlings were rub-inoculated with a dna plasmid mix corresponding to bpmv-gfp  following the conditions defined above. the first occurrence of gfp fluorescence was visible in leaves inoculated with bpmv-gfp at ~ <dig> dpi . fluorescence pattern, in the form of round green spots, corresponded to the primary infection sites. as expected, no fluorescence was detected in the negative controls  . at  <dig> dpi, the area displaying fluorescence had increased in the inoculated primary leaf and had extended to the third trifoliate leaves, indicating that the viral vector has moved to the upper systemic leaves . systemic infection of the third trifoliate leaves increased at  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi, 55% of the plants inoculated with bpmv-gfp were effectively infected .figure  <dig>

temporal and spatial bpmv infection patterns in vegetative and reproductive tissues of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine
infection patterns were investigated in both vegetative and reproductive tissues of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine using gfp expression as a marker of infection. seedlings were rub-inoculated with leaf sap derived from plants infected with bpmv-gfp. in the inoculated leaf, gfp fluorescence appeared 4– <dig> dpi, which was earlier than in dna plasmid-infected plants. at  <dig> dpi, these leaves displayed extensive fluorescence, appearing as regularly distributed green round spots corresponding to the primary infection sites . in the upper systemic leaves, the third and fourth trifoliates showed extensive green fluorescence at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively, indicating that systemic infection occurred more rapidly than in dna plasmid-infected plants . high levels of fluorescence were also detected in stems  and lateral roots . at  <dig> wpi, 100% of the bpmv-gfp inoculated plants were infected, and similar results were obtained for bpmv- <dig> infected plants, demonstrating the high efficiency of viral infection using leaf sap. we also demonstrated that the bpmv-gfp vector was stable after four serial inoculations of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine .

gfp fluorescence was detected in reproductive tissues of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine . fluorescence was observed at  <dig> dpi in floral buds of bpmv-gfp infected plants. in petals, we observed stronger fluorescence in the standard  compared with the lateral and ventral petals . at  <dig> wpi, pods of bpmv- <dig> and bpmv-gfp infected plants exhibited strong viral symptoms characterized by a curved shape and a bloated and mottled pod surface . when observed under uv light, infected pods from bpmv-gfp infected plants displayed extensive and homogenous gfp fluorescence . notably, at  <dig> wpi, no gfp fluorescence was detected in the embryos of seeds harvested from bpmv-gfp-infected plants, while strong fluorescence was observed in the corresponding seed coats .figure  <dig>

bpmv infection efficiency in other p. vulgaris cultivars
as vigs is an effective genomics tool only in genotypes where the viral vector can spread systemically, we tested different p. vulgaris cultivars  for their susceptibility to bpmv. of significant interest are jaloeep <dig> and bat <dig>  the two parental lines of a rils population used to set up the integrated linkage map of p. vulgaris  <cit> , and bat <dig> and g <dig> whose complete genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . black valentine was included as a control of susceptibility to bpmv.

the three genotypes of significant interest were first inoculated with leaf sap containing the bpmv- <dig> vector   <cit> . as in black valentine, upper systemic leaves of infected jaloeep <dig> plants displayed strong viral symptoms at  <dig> dpi . by contrast, systemic leaves of infected bat <dig> and g <dig> plants were symptomless at  <dig> dpi and looked like systemic leaves of mock-inoculated plants . semi-quantitative rt-pcr on systemic leaves of mock- and bpmv-0-inoculated plants with primers specific to bpmv rna <dig> and rna <dig> confirmed that viral rnas were present only in systemic leaves of jaloeep <dig> plants inoculated with bpmv- <dig> . no viral rna was amplified in the systemic leaves of bat <dig> and g <dig> .figure  <dig>

all genotypes were then tested using the bpmv-gfp vector. we detected fluorescence in inoculated leaves at  <dig> dpi only in the jaloeep <dig> cultivar, and to a lesser extent in the g <dig> and la victoire cultivars . when compared to inoculated leaves of black valentine, the intensity of gfp fluorescence was greater in inoculated leaves of jaloeep <dig> . surprisingly, systemic leaves of jaloeep <dig> did not display gfp fluorescence at  <dig> or  <dig> dpi. this failure of long-distance movement is not intrinsic to the bmpv-gfp construct, as it has been found to be capable of long-distance movement in black valentine . gfp expression was confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr with primers specific to both bpmv rnas. for rna <dig>  specific primers were designed to span the cloning site of the gfp orf and produced a pcr product of 863 bp in inoculated leaves of both black valentine and jaloeep <dig> plants treated with bpmv-gfp . by contrast, no corresponding pcr product was amplified in systemic leaves of jaloeep <dig> inoculated with bpmv-gfp . furthermore, no rna <dig> band of lower size was visible on the electrophoresis gel after amplification with rna2-gfp primers on samples of jaloeep <dig> systemic leaves , excluding an eventual recombination within rna <dig> of bpmv-gfp resulting in an entire or partial loss of the gfp orf.figure  <dig>

virus-induced gene silencing of pvpds in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine using a heterologous gene fragment
the efficiency of endogenous gene silencing using the bpmv vigs vector delivered through direct dna rubbing in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine was investigated by targeting the pvpds gene. pds is routinely used as a marker gene for vigs in plants as silencing this gene causes chlorophyll degradation resulting in a typical photobleached phenotype in emerging leaves. initial tests were carried out with the bpmv-gmpds-327 bp construct containing a 327 bp fragment of the pds gene from glycine max   as it was immediately available   <cit> . alignment of the 327 bp gmpds fragment with pvpds sequences from g <dig> and bat <dig> revealed a high level of sequence conservation with  <dig> dna stretches of 23 nt or more  having 100% identity between the two pvpds sequences and the gmpds sequence . the bpmv-gmpds-327 bp construct was delivered into p. vulgaris cv. black valentine seedlings by direct rub-inoculation. infected leaves were used for secondary inoculations of healthy plants. the infected plants displayed photobleached leaves at  <dig> dpi, unlike plants infected with the empty bpmv- <dig> vector or mock buffer .figure  <dig>

cv. black valentine using the vigs vector bpmv-gmpds-327 bp.  plants inoculated with mock buffer , bpmv- <dig> , and bpmv-gmpds-327 bp  were photographed under natural light at 28 days post-inoculation .  trifoliate systemic leaves.  semi-quantitative rt-pcr of pvpds, bpmv rna <dig> and rna <dig> in systemic leaves of plants inoculated with mock, bpmv- <dig>  and bpmv-gmpds-327 bp. ubiquitin  was used as an internal control. total rna was extracted at  <dig> dpi from the third trifoliate leaf of three different plants of black valentine.



in order to confirm that the photobleached phenotype described above correlated with reduced endogenous levels of pvpds, semi-quantitative rt-pcr was carried out on systemic leaves from each of the three treatment groups . to test whether the phenotype observed in treated plants could be due to the presence of the viral vectors, the presence of bpmv rna <dig> and rna <dig> transcripts was also determined by rt-pcr . as expected, samples from the mock-treated plants did not show viral rna <dig> and rna <dig> unlike bpmv- <dig> and bpmv-gmpds-327 bp inoculated plants . bpmv- <dig> inoculated plants showed expression levels of pvpds similar to that of mock-treated plants, suggesting that the viral treatment does not interfere with pvpds expression . in samples from the bpmv-gmpds-327 bp treated plants, there was a strong down-regulation of pvpds , as indicated by the lack of visible bands on the gel .

minimal fragment size for efficient vigs of pvpds in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine
to determine the minimal size required to induce efficient silencing by the bpmv-derived vector, fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to 391 bp  of the pvpds gene from jaloeep <dig> were cloned into the bamhi restriction site of the pbpmv-ia-v <dig> plasmid. the different fragment sizes ranging from  <dig> to 391 bp were chosen in the same 3’-end coding region of the pvpds gene. the fragment of 52 bp corresponds to the longest region presenting 100% nucleic identity between the 327-bp fragment of the glycine max pds ortholog  and the corresponding regions of pvpds from p. vulgaris cv. g <dig>  and bat <dig>  . the fragment of 391 bp corresponds approximately to the insert size chosen by zhang et al.  <cit> . the two fragments of  <dig> and 262 bp present intermediate sizes between  <dig> and 391 bp.

homologous 391 bp-region of pvpds from jaloeep <dig> and black valentine were 100% identical . plasmids containing pvpds gene fragments of different lengths were used for primary inoculation of p. vulgaris cv. black valentine seedlings, which were then used for secondary inoculation of wild type plants. at  <dig> wpi, plants inoculated with the bpmv-pvpds-262 bp and bpmv-pvpds-391 bp constructs displayed a clear photobleached phenotype with completely white newly emerging leaves . no photobleaching was observed in plants inoculated with bpmv-pvpds-52 bp . plants inoculated with bpmv-pvpds-132 bp displayed an intermediate phenotype characterized by green leaves with white sectors . this result demonstrates that a fragment of 132 bp, bearing 100% homology with the targeted sequence, is sufficient to trigger efficient silencing of an endogenous gene by the bpmv-derived vector in common bean cv. black valentine. nevertheless, as vigs efficiency throughout the plant was higher with the bpmv-pvpds-391 bp vector, further experiments were conducted using this vector.figure  <dig>

the duration of vigs was estimated in p. vulgaris cv. black valentine plants inoculated with the bpmv-pvpds-391 bp vector. plants grown under normal light conditions showed recovery of silenced leaves more than 2 months pi, as characterized by an overall decline of white leaves over time. however, silenced plants placed under high intensity illumination  displayed a photobleached phenotype for more than 3 months pi .

virus-induced gene silencing of pvpds in p. vulgaris cv. jaloeep558
to evaluate the efficiency of pvpds vigs in jaloeep <dig>  rub-inoculation was carried out with the bpmv-pvpds-391 bp vector derived from leaf sap extracted from infected leaves of primary inoculated black valentine plants.

the onset of silencing, with the appearance of photobleaching, was delayed in jaloeep <dig>  compared to black valentine . moreover, complete whitening of trifoliate leaves was less frequent in jaloeep <dig> than in black valentine controls, and in most cases, intermediate phenotypes were observed with leaflets having white sectors or whitening limited to the vasculature .figure  <dig>

although photobleaching was limited, systemic leaves of jaloeep <dig> exhibited typical viral symptoms . thus, to be sure that systemic leaves with viral symptoms still contained the bpmv rna <dig> carrying the pvpds 391-bp insert, we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses. rt-pcr with rna2-specific primers spanning the bamhi cloning site produced a product size of 234 bp in leaves of plants inoculated with bpmv- <dig>  corresponding to the distance between primers in the absence of insert . by contrast, a larger pcr product of 637 bp was amplified in samples of bpmv-pvpds-391 bp-inoculated plants ,thereby confirming the presence of the 391-bp pvpds insert within bpmv rna <dig> in the systemic leaves of jaloeep <dig> .

we also tested the bpmv-pvpds-262 bp and bpmv-pvpds-132 bp vectors in jaloeep <dig>  no enhanced silencing phenotype was observed compared to plants inoculated with bpmv-pvpds-391 bp , although these vectors also spread systemically in jaloeep <dig> without losing their pvpds insert .

phenotyping of the resistance to bpmv in common bean rils and genetic mapping of the r-bpmv gene
our finding that the parental genotypes of a  <dig> rils population used to set up the integrated linkage map of common bean  <cit>  differed markedly in their susceptibility to bpmv  allowed to us to investigate the genetic control of bpmv resistance. the  <dig> rils inoculated with bpmv-gfp were phenotyped at  <dig> dpi. presence of fluorescent local lesions on the inoculated leaf was scored as “susceptible”  and absence of gfp fluorescence was scored as “resistant”  . the observed segregation ratio fitted a 1: <dig> ratio of susceptible to resistant plants  suggesting that a single gene  is segregating.figure  <dig>

the bpmv-gfp construct is an ideal tool to phenotype the  <dig> rils since it allowed a visual, rapid and non-destructive scoring of resistance to bpmv. to test whether the presence of the gfp orf in the bpmv rna <dig> could interfere with resistance/susceptibility to bpmv, we chose a set of  <dig> resistant and  <dig> susceptible rils   and inoculated them with the empty vector construct  or mock buffer. at  <dig> dpi, trifoliate leaves of all  <dig> rils were visually inspected for the presence of viral symptoms relative to bpmv systemic infection. as expected, all  <dig> resistant rils were symptomless, as were the mock-treated plants . among the  <dig> susceptible rils, all displayed viral symptoms, except a <dig> which looked like mock-inoculated plants . three trifoliate leaves from three different plants of each ril were harvested at  <dig> dpi and pooled. rt-pcr analyses were performed on these leaf pools using bpmv rna1- and rna2-specific primers . no viral rnas were detected in any of the  <dig> resistant rils whereas viral rnas were amplified from all  <dig> susceptible rils . these results confirmed that common bean resistance to bpmv can be scored using the bpmv-gfp construct, instead of wild-type bpmv.

using the total  <dig> rils, the r-bpmv gene was mapped at one end of lg b <dig>  between marker dros3b and the i locus, at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively . the i locus has been previously shown to control the development of four different phenotypes in response to inoculation with several potyviruses  <cit> , and one comovirus   <cit> .

discussion
in the post-genomic era, increasing efforts are being made in plant functional genomics. vigs technology is a simple and powerful tool that has been widely used to analyze gene function in many plant families such as solanaceae, brassicaceae, poaceae, ranunculaceae, and asteraceae  and especially fabaceae  <cit>  where many species are difficult to transform genetically by other means. recent improvements in vigs methodology have been reported such as the development of new vigs vectors, a widening of the viral host range, and the improvement of vector delivery methods  <cit> . the development of direct rub-inoculation of column–purified plasmids has simplified the inoculation procedure, making it rapid and cost-effective for high-throughput functional analyses  <cit> . rub-inoculation was found to be similarly effective to biolistic delivery in soybean, with infection rates ranging from 50-58%  for direct dna rubbing and 50-80%  for biolistic inoculation  <cit> . here we show for the first time that direct dna rubbing, using a “one-step” bpmv vector originally developed in soybean, is a convenient delivery procedure in common bean. infection rates in common bean cv. black valentine, ranging from 33-91%  for primary inoculations and 100% for secondary inoculations using leaf sap, were comparable to those obtained in soybean by either dna rubbing or biolistic delivery. previous work by diaz-camino et al.  <cit>  demonstrated efficient vigs in cv. black valentine using the first generation bpmv vector  <cit>  with a 40-80% infection rate  for primary inoculations and 100% for secondary inoculations. however, this vector has limiting features, including the requirement for vector delivery to be carried out by mechanical inoculation of in vitro-transcribed rna, which is a rather labor intensive and an expensive procedure. the infection rates reported here are comparable to those reported in diaz-camino et al.  <cit> , with the advantage of using a simplified, cost-effective method that is still highly consistent. advantages of the “one-step” bpmv vector in common bean include:  no in vitro transcription of plasmid dna required,  vector delivery into plants by conventional rub-inoculation, without any requirement for biolistic or agro-inoculation procedures, and  silencing induced in 60% of the inoculated plants with low quantities  of each infectious plasmid carrying bpmv rna <dig> and rna <dig>  these features are critical for the development of high-throughput infection procedures.

plant virus-based vectors are valuable tools for heterologous protein expression in plants. these vectors are fast-acting, cost-efficient, high yield, and significantly they can be used in a variety of genetic backgrounds provided that a given genotype is susceptible to the viral vector. to date, the bpmv vector is the only available virus-based system that is effective for stable expression of foreign protein in common bean. we found that a recombinant bpmv-gfp vector gives an intense gfp expression in a large range of vegetative and reproductive organs in common bean cv. black valentine . in the “one-step” bpmv vector used in this study, the foreign orf  is inserted before a foot and mouth disease virus  2a proteinase peptide engineered between the movement protein and the large coat protein  cistrons of rna <dig>  <cit> . because the cleavage at the 2a site occurs between the two last amino acids, the foreign protein contains ~ <dig> additional amino acids and the l-cp has an additional proline at its n-terminus. these characteristics have led diaz-camino et al.  <cit>  to suggest that such a recombinant vector could be difficult to maintain through serial passages in plants. however, our results showed that gfp expression was stable after four serial passages in cv. black valentine , suggesting that the “one-step” vector is as efficient as the first-generation vector which was also stable after four serial passages in both soybean cv. essex and common bean cv. black valentine  <cit> . further investigations are needed to determine the maximal insert size compatible with virus infectivity and systemic movement for a given genotype. previous studies have estimated the bpmv rna <dig> vector capacity for foreign gene insertion to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb  <cit> . although the average length of a plant gene is ~3 kb, it could be possible to express short proteins such as bacterial or fungal effectors involved in plant immune responses.

endogenous gene silencing is an important tool for functional genetics. as common bean is not amenable to stable genetic transformation, vigs provides a rapid and powerful tool to dissect gene function in this economically important species. in this study, we found that the vigs method using the “one-step” bpmv vector induced efficient silencing of the endogene pvpds in common bean cv. black valentine . down-regulation of pvpds transcripts in infected black valentine plants was nearly total . moreover, the photobleached phenotype linked to pvpds down-regulation was stable under our experimental conditions, lasting for 2 months in plants grown under normal light conditions and for  <dig>  months in plants grown under high intensity illumination. in barley, reversion of pds silencing has been shown to be caused by major deletions in the pds insert carried by a barley stripe mosaic virus -derived vector  <cit> . in bsmv-infected barley plants, a 400 bp-pds insert was partially lost at  <dig> dpi and completely lost at  <dig> wpi. by contrast, there was no evidence of deletions at  <dig> wpi in jaloeep <dig> plants infected with bpmv-pvpds-391 bp , confirming the stability of the “one-step” bpmv vector.

our results showed that bpmv spreads systemically throughout the whole plant in black valentine . following bmvp-gfp infection, fluorescence was detected in primary leaves, trifoliate leaves, stems, roots, floral buds, flowers, pods, and seed coats . as vigs is effective only in the tissues infected by the viral vector, it should therefore be possible to induce gene silencing in all these organs.

one limitation of vigs is that it is possible only in genotypes where the viral vector can spread systemically. for a given species, different genotypes might react differently to viral infection, from total resistance due to specific resistance genes to various levels of susceptibility. this has been well-documented for example in the pea early browning virus-derived vector in medicago truncatula and lathyrus odorata  <cit> . so, it is essential to test the susceptibility of each genotype of interest. prior to this study, black valentine was the only common bean genotype known to be susceptible to bpmv  <cit> . we analyzed six other common bean genotypes and found that five  were resistant to bpmv , and only one  was susceptible. this implies that vigs using the “one-step” bpmv vector will not be possible in the two sequenced genotypes of common bean . in jaloeep <dig>  vigs was shown to be delayed compared to black valentine and displayed a patchier phenotype. thus, implementation of vigs in jaloeep <dig> will require further investigation to improve vigs efficiency. the extent to which the “one-step” bpmv vector can be used in other legume species is unknown, and it would be interesting to test the susceptibility to bpmv in species such as cajanus cajan or cicer arietinum, whose genomes have recently been sequenced  <cit> , pisum sativum, another economically important legume species for human consumption and animal feeding in europe, as well as the model legume medicago truncatula  <cit> .

to improve vigs analysis in common bean, some technical improvements might be considered. first, as bpmv viral symptoms could interfere with the silencing phenotype of a given target gene, it should be possible to use the wild type rna <dig> from isolate ia-di <dig> rather than the mutated variant rna1m  used in this study. second, vigs in target tissues is usually patchy due to the irregular distribution of the vector in the whole plant. in order to identify infected areas undergoing silencing, pds could be used as a traceable marker that would be silenced along with the target gene. a recombinant bpmv vector containing a pds insert in addition to the target gene insert could be engineered based on the pbpmv-ia-v <dig> construct designed by zhang et al.  <cit> . in this construct, the bamh <dig> restriction site is replaced by a multicloning site so that simultaneous silencing of two endogenes could be achieved. we found that pds silencing can be achieved with an insert of only 132 bp resulting in a patchy photobleached phenotype . combination of the 132 bp-pds insert with a second insert corresponding to the target gene could therefore be a good compromise for conducting marker-assisted vigs experiments. however, additional experiments need to be carried out to evaluate any possible impact of pds silencing on unintended target gene expression. such interference has been described in gerbera hybrid, where photobleaching induced by a tobacco rattle virus -pds construct resulted in silencing of the polyketide synthase gene g2ps <dig> involved in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway, which has no apparent link to the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway  <cit> .

in this study, we reported the genetic mapping of an r-gene  present in the bpmv-resistant bat <dig> and absent in the bpmv-susceptible jaloeep <dig>  which confers an extreme resistance to bpmv isolate ia-di <dig>  using the bmpv-gfp construct as a marker of susceptibility, we found that phenotypic segregation of the  <dig> rils derived from a cross between bat <dig> and jaloeep <dig>  <cit>  fitted a 1: <dig> ratio, suggesting that a single gene may be implicated in viral resistance. as far as we know, this is the first report in plants of genetic mapping of a virus resistance gene using a recombinant viral vector expressing an easily traceable marker such as the gfp protein. main advantages of using the bpmv-gfp construct for phenotyping rils include rapid  and highly reliable results that preclude the need for molecular analyses such as rt-pcr that would be required if symptoms were ambiguous.

genetic mapping of the r-bpmv gene is significant for two reasons. first, it will allow the functional validation of other resistance genes present in bat <dig>  indeed, bat <dig> possesses many resistance genes against damaging pathogens of common bean such as colletotrichum lindemuthianum, a hemibiotrophic fungus. functional validation of these genes, for example co- <dig> located on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> , cannot be monitored by bpmv-mediated vigs studies, since bat <dig> is resistant to bpmv. however, it would be possible to identify a ril individual, derived from the cross between bat <dig> and jaloeep <dig>  which carries both the bmpv susceptibility of jaloeep <dig> and the co- <dig> gene from bat <dig>  in such a ril genotype, vigs is feasible and the resistance gene of interest is present and can therefore be silenced. the second area of interest is related to agricultural applications. bpmv has been reported to be a major threat to soybean production in the usa  <cit> . to our knowledge, all commercially available cultivars of soybean are susceptible to bpmv infection. we suggest that r-bpmv may be a useful resource for the development of bpmv resistant soybean, as the r-bpmv gene confers extreme resistance to bpmv isolate ia-di <dig>  we are currently fine-mapping the r-bpmv gene, located near the i locus previously implicated in virus resistance  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we report the successful implementation in common bean of a dna-based bpmv vector originally developed in soybean by zhang et al.  <cit> . we showed that the “one-step” bpmv vector has the potential to enable cost-effective and simplified screening of common bean plants via a simple “one-step” rub-inoculation of miniprep-quality plasmid dna. this bpmv vector can be used for heterologous protein expression, target gene silencing by vigs, and genetic mapping of a bpmv resistance gene in common bean. the “one-step” bpmv vector system enables rapid and simple functional studies in common bean, and is suitable for large-scale analyses. our protocol could facilitate the characterization of the many genes in common bean, particularly genes involved in disease resistance. in the post-genomic era, these advances are timely for the common bean research community.
