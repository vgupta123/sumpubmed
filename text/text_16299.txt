BACKGROUND
endomembrane trafficking in eukaryotes is essential for the intracellular delivery of cargoes and membranes. as the site of protein degradation, nutrient recycling and storage of biological components, the vacuole is one of the key compartments of the endomembrane system. in addition, the mechanisms implicated in the delivery of cargoes to the vacuole have been delineated mainly by yeast genetic screens. a relatively new approach for discovering cellular pathways that takes advantage of yeast genetics is chemical genomics, which uses small bioactive molecules that can affect biological pathways  <cit> . the physiological effects of such drugs may be appreciated and exploited long before the corresponding targets are identified. however, the eventual identification of target proteins within drug-sensitive pathways is necessary to discover and characterize intracellular networks  <cit> .

using forward chemical genomics, we identified fourteen low mass compounds that interfere with the delivery of the vacuolar resident protein carboxypeptidase y  in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . these compounds are able to trigger the secretion of cpy, mimicking the vacuole protein sorting  phenotype  <cit> . two of these compounds, sortin <dig> and sortin <dig>  result in the secretion of cpy in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . to understand sortin <dig> activity in more detail, we focused on two objectives: to understand the structural features of sortin <dig> necessary for its activity and to analyze s. cerevisiae cellular pathways affected by the chemical. the bioactivity of different sortin <dig> analogues highlighted structural domains important for sortin <dig> activity. in order to identify the cellular pathway affected by sortin <dig>  a genetic screen was performed for strains hypersensitive to this chemical in a s. cerevisiae haploid deletion collection. among  <dig>  clones screened,  <dig> strains were hypersensitive to sortin <dig>  bioinformatics analysis indicated that the sortin <dig> dataset was enriched in components related to protein trafficking and localized primarily to the endomembrane system, particularly endosomes. our approach permitted an initial functional assignment of fifteen genes of previously unknown function to protein trafficking pathways.

RESULTS
carboxypeptidase y  is a soluble vacuolar hydrolase that is sorted from the late golgi to the late endosome and subsequently trafficked to the vacuole  <cit> . in yeast, sortin <dig> interfered with cpy sorting resulting in secretion to the media  <cit> . sortin <dig> also phenocopied vps mutants without inhibiting yeast growth, at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm . upon sortin <dig> treatment, there was no detectable presence in the medium of the proteins such as alkaline phosphatase , a membrane-bound vacuolar protein, or 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, a cytoplasmic protein . these controls indicated that cpy in the medium of sortin2-treated cells was not due to cell lysis. the total amount of expressed cpy protein was not significantly affected by sortin <dig> treatment indicating that its secretion was due to an alteration in cargo delivery rather than simple overloading of endomembrane compartments . therefore, we concluded that sortin <dig> targeted components involved in the delivery of cpy from the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole.

sortin <dig> structure-bioactivity relationships
in order to understand the structural determinants of sortin  <dig> necessary for bioactivity, a panel of chemicals that were similar in structure to sortin <dig> were examined. the sortin <dig> contains discrete domains: a chlorobenzene, a furan, a thiazolidine ring, and a sulphite group. the activity of structural analogs as promoters of cpy secretion is shown in figure  <dig>  for convenience, the potency of sortin  <dig> and its analogues was defined as the minimum concentration at which activity was observed.

chemical  <dig>  represented the sortin <dig> structure minus the sulphite group. this analogue was inactive indicating that the sulphite group was critical for binding of sortin <dig> to its target. chemical  <dig> which had a benzoic ring substitution instead of the sulphite group had the same activity as sortin <dig>  chemical  <dig> had a carboxyl group instead of the sulphite group. it was bioactive; however, it had a lower potency  than sortin <dig> and chemical  <dig> . taken together, these data suggest that the interaction between sortin <dig> and its target probably required a dense electron cloud in order to affect target activity and function. this could be direct or indirect by affecting the overall conformation of sortin <dig> 

chemical  <dig> lacked the chlorobenzene ring, but did not alter the delivery of cpy to the vacuole. we further tested the importance of the chlorine on the benzene ring by testing another chemical  which had a nitro group substitution. chemical  <dig> was twenty times less active than sortin <dig> which indicated that the presence of the chloride was important for full activity. however, chemical  <dig>  in which the chloride was absent showed a potency that was similar to that of chemical  <dig> supporting the notion that the halogen atom was not a key feature for bioactivity. chemical  <dig> which had two chlorides associated with the benzoic group was completely inactive, perhaps due to steric effects. steric hindrance may also explain the low activity of chemical  <dig> since the major difference was the chloride and nitro groups. overall we concluded that the sulphite group and the benzoic acid ring were essential for sortin <dig> bioactivity.

screening for yeast mutants hypersensitive to sortin2
in order to identify cellular pathways affected by sortin <dig> a haploid yeast deletion library was screened for mutants that secreted cpy at concentrations of sortin <dig> that did not trigger detectable cpy secretion in the wild type haploid strain. of the collection of  <dig>  strains,  <dig> putative hypersensitive mutants were identified in the primary screen . each putative mutant was subsequently exposed to various concentrations of sortin <dig> to verify the drug dependency of their secretion phenotype . a mutant was considered verified as hypersensitive if significant cpy secretion was detected at a concentration of sortin <dig> less than that necessary to result in cpy secretion from the parental line . ninety percent  of the strains were verified as hypersensitive to sortin  <dig>  the large number of successfully verified strains demonstrated the robustness of the primary screen.

vacuolar protein sorting  mutants and hypersensitivity to sortin2
sixty-one yeast deletion strains were known previously to have impaired sorting of cpy; these are referred to as vps mutants. forty-one vps mutants were identified as drug-dependent in our screen with respect to sortin <dig>  these included mutants in all six classes of vps genes . class e is involved in protein sorting to lumenal vesicles of the mvb . this family contains  <dig> members plus vta <dig> and hse1; however, the latter two genes were not described as vps genes  <cit> . remarkably, fourteen out of sixteen members  of the vps class e were hypersensitive to sortin <dig>  the class with highest representation among vps genes. interestingly, the remaining  <dig> vps mutants displayed no secretion of cpy when treated with sortin <dig>  the screen, thus, discriminated between deletion and sortin2-induced vps phenotypes. this indicated that the sortin <dig> phenotype was specific and distinct, rather than a broad effect on secretion, when compared to the majority of the vps mutants. as part of this screen, we analyzed the drug sensitivity of  <dig> strains identified previously in a screen for mutants that secreted cpy  <cit> . among these mutants,  <dig> were hypersensitive to sortin <dig> when compared to the untreated control. the absence of a hypersensitive response from the other  <dig> mutants indicated that sortin <dig> was selective for specific elements of the vacuole targeting machinery.

analyses of identified orfs
funcat  <cit>  was used to classify the sortin <dig> hypersensitive dataset into functional categories relative to the saccharomyces genome . some categories showed statistically significant over-representation such as "interaction with the environment" and "biogenesis of cellular components" which were enriched  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively  . the greatest enrichment were the categories "protein fate" and "cellular transport, transport facilities and transport routes" which displayed  <dig> - and 3-fold enrichment, respectively . in terms of subcellular location, the greatest over-representation corresponded to the category "endosomes" with a  <dig> -fold enrichment compared to the yeast genome  . the "golgi apparatus", "transport vesicles", "vacuole" and "punctuate composite" categories were enriched between  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold with statistically significant over-representation as shown by the p-values in table  <dig>  these results revealed that processes within the endomembrane system are strongly and specifically affected by sortin <dig> treatment.

forty-seven percent of the sortin <dig> dataset was associated with the go term "transport". the set was analyzed by term finder tools, and significantly, the sole descendant terms included "protein transport", "intracellular transport", "vesicle-mediated transport" and "secretory pathway" highlighting the involvement of the majority of identified orfs in protein trafficking pathways . we also applied the term finder tool to analyze the association of the sortin <dig> dataset with granular go terms that were linked to a cellular component . within the sortin <dig> hypersensitive dataset, we identified members of crucial golgi and endosomal sorting complexes, their interacting partners and other resident proteins associated all directly in cpy sorting . in the endosomal compartment, which is the destination for cpy after exiting the late golgi, we identified members of the three known endosomal and the mvb sorting complexes. systematic deletion of escrt  genes was reported to cause reduced telomere length  <cit> . interestingly, we identified escrt-unrelated telomere length mutants as hypersensitive in our screen. in addition several mutants linked to chromatin remodelling were identified . overall, we concluded that the sortin <dig> hypersensitive orfs were located preferentially within the endomembrane system and included many molecular components related to the cpy delivery. our screening results also supported the hypothesis previously proposed that interactivity occurs between the endomembrane system, chromatin remodelling, and telomere maintenance processes.

importantly, the sublethal conditions of the screening assay yielded an unbiased set of mutants. the dataset did not include any abc transporters or ergosterol biosynthetic genes which are related to multi-drug resistance  <cit>  suggesting that the screen distinguished between induced vps phenotypes and general drug sensitivity.

unknown genes
of  <dig> sortin <dig> hypersensitive mutants,  <dig> were classified as unknown according to the sgd databases. among these orfs, several were dubious genes with known genes on the complementary dna strand. it is also possible that the sortin <dig> phenotype resulted from a defect in an authentic gene whose orf overlapped the dubious orf. these dubious genes are listed with their corresponding known orfs in parenthesis in table  <dig>  yip <dig> encodes a protein that mediates vesicular trafficking via its interaction with rab gtpases  <cit>  supporting the dubious character of ygl199c. similarly, gim5p is a member of a protein complex that promotes formation of functional α- and γ-tubulin  <cit> . this complex includes gim4p that was identified in our screen; thus yml094c-a is probably a dubious orf.

the name in parenthesis correspond to the known gene on the complementary dna strain of dubious genes

other unknown genes were found in high-throughput screens that focused on genetic/physical interactions and protein localization  <cit> . this annotation supports putative roles for the corresponding gene products in protein trafficking. ygr206wp, for example, was identified as endosomal and more recently as a component of the escrt- <dig> complex  <cit> . ygr206wp and ylr426wp physically interact with the v-atpase subunit vma6p  <cit> . their corresponding genes together with ynl080c, sna <dig> and tms <dig> were the only uncharacterized orfs from our dataset that overlapped previously unknown genes whose deletion resulted in cpy secretion  <cit> . excluding the  <dig> dubious orfs described above, the remaining  <dig> unknown genes have not been associated previously with protein sorting pathways. among these unknowns, yil041wp  was localized to golgi vesicles  <cit> . the mutants for the unknown orfs ydr357c and ygl079w were hypersensitive to sortin <dig> and their gene products were identified as interacting partners in a two-hybrid assay  <cit> . the gfp fusion of ygl079wp co-localizes with an endosome marker  <cit> . in addition, ydr357cp and yll049wp, both from the sortin <dig> dataset, physically interact with the autophagy protein atg17p  <cit>  suggesting a role in the endomembrane system. similarly, yil039w and ylr361c  genetically interact with the golgi residents ric1p and ypt6p  <cit> , both of which mediate vesicular trafficking at the golgi apparatus. tvp38p  is an integral membrane protein localized to late golgi vesicles along with the v-snare tlg2p  <cit> .

to test the interaction of mutants in unknown orfs with sortin <dig>  active and inactive analogues were tested for their ability of trigger cpy secretion in the corresponding deletion mutants for ydr525w-a/sna <dig>  ydr105c/tms <dig>  ygl079w, yll049w, ykr088c/tvp <dig> . all of the mutants were more hypersensitive compared to their parental strain when grown in the presence of bioactive compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, none of the strains tested were hypersensitive to the inactive sortin <dig> analogues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, the sortin <dig> hypersensitivity of mutants in these genes of unknown function was specific for analogues possessing features important for sortin <dig> bioactivity. there were no detectable alp or pgk proteins in the culture media for any sortin <dig> analogs  indicating that the cpy secretion was not due to the cell lysis.

in summary, we assigned a putative role in protein trafficking to  <dig> orfs of unknown function in s. cerevisiae based on their sortin2-induced vps phenotypes. the actual role of these orfs will be addressed in future studies.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the structure-activity relationships and the cellular pathways affected by sortin <dig> which triggers the secretion of the soluble vacuolar protein cpy in s. cerevisiae and a. thaliana. our sortin <dig> hypersensitive screen identified genes whose loss of function resulted in no vacuolar sorting defects; however, a sorting defect occurred when these mutants were challenged with the drug.  furthermore, our analysis implicated a number of genes of unknown function in the process of vacuolar protein sorting. therefore, this approach could be of general use for discovering the functional identity of uncharacterized genes.

the use and analysis of sortin <dig> structural analogs allowed us to define the sulphite substitution and benzoic acid group on sortin <dig> as key determinants for bioactivity and perhaps target binding. interaction with a target would probably require both ends of the molecule suggesting a binding pocket that recognizes one face of sortin <dig>  however, the possibility of multiple binding pockets or targets can not rule out. it is possible to speculate that the dimensions of the binding pocket in the cognate target are very exacting for activity resulting in lower potency or no activity as observed for several sortin <dig> analogs. the compounds tested are within the parameters set by lipinski  <cit>  indicating that compound permeability would not be an issue.

we screened for enhanced secretion in the presence of sortin <dig> using a haploid deletion library. if the drug has a single target, deletion of the gene encoding the target would result in a strain whose phenotype could not be enhanced further by the drug. thus, our approach would not identify a cognate target. however, we anticipated that this hypersensitive screen would identify proteins that were either in the same pathway or in a pathway connected to the sortin <dig> target. the main pathway affected by sortin <dig> is the endomembrane system although the effect could be indirect. the intracellular location displaying the greatest enrichment was the endosomes suggesting that the sortin <dig> target may be affecting mainly the endosomal compartments which precede the final localization of cpy. consistent with this idea, almost 90% of the vps class e mutants, which have an aberrant mvb , were hypersensitive to sortin <dig>  sortin <dig> is able to mimic the vps phenotype; however, its effect on mvb structure has not been tested yet.

sortin <dig> will be useful for probing conserved processes such as endomembrane trafficking in other organisms, and the powerful genomics available will permit the identification of cognate targets.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we combined chemical, genomic and genetics approaches to understand the mode of action of sortin <dig>  a bioactive chemical that affects the delivery of a vacuolar protein. several features of sortin <dig> structure are critical for bioactivity suggesting a binding pocket that recognizes one face of the molecule.

the genome-wide screen in yeast showed that sortin <dig> mainly affected components within the endomembrane system. other cellular functions affected by sortin <dig> may highlight interactions between cellular processes. our approach allowed us to assign a putative function in protein sorting for  <dig> genes of unknown function that were not associated previously with protein trafficking pathways.
