BACKGROUND
conifers are the most abundant group of gymnosperms and include tree species of great ecological and economical relevance. conifers cover vast areas within the forest of the northern hemisphere and are extensively exploited as the main source of wood for industrial purposes  <cit> .

the abundance of polysaccharides, pigments and phenolic compounds in the lignified tissues of conifers has hampered research on the molecular biology of these plants for many years. until the development of recent adapted protocols, rna  <cit>  and dna  <cit>  extractions from conifer tissues were difficult and extremely laborious. however, in the last decade considerable progress has been made in establishing adapted protocols and techniques that are now utilized in molecular studies of conifer biology. these include methods such as laser-capture microdissection  <cit> , microarray hybridization  <cit>  and both stable  <cit>  and transient transformation  <cit> .

although conifer genomes are extremely large, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> gigabases, recent developments in next-generation sequencing have facilitated new advances in genomics research  <cit> . in the past few years the assembly of several conifer transcriptomes  and genomes has been reported . despite these recent developments, the use of genome-wide expression techniques based on sequencing  in conifer species has remained limited . furthermore, the lack of reference genome/transcriptome for read mapping generally necessitates the use of self-assemblies of the transcriptomes.

these new genomic tools have enormous potential for use in studies of the molecular basis of genetic diversity and the adaptations of conifers to the environment. this is important because trees with a wide geographical distribution have a variety of latitudinal and altitudinal ecotypes  adapted to local light and climate conditions  <cit> . a certain inherent flexibility in the response to varying temperature and photoperiod conditions has been observed in trees  <cit> . one such example is the well-studied response of conifers to extreme winter periods when they are subjected to cold, drought and oxidative stresses  <cit> . conifers have developed a series of responses to these environmental changes including the accumulation of “compatible solutes” , adjustments of membrane lipid composition  <cit>  and changes in energy metabolism that prioritize oxidative phosphorylation when photosynthesis is arrested .

because of its economic and environmental potential, the maritime pine  is one the most important conifer species in the southwestern mediterranean region. maritime pine is also a conifer species with advanced genomic research in europe and a large number of genomic resources have been generated in the last few years  <cit> .

this pine species has high phenotypic plasticity with high tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and is widely distributed in different environments and climates . intraspecific variability has been observed in hormone production between p. pinaster populations growing under different environmental conditions  <cit> . therefore, the maritime pine is an excellent model for studying the molecular basis of environmental adaptation using functional genomic approaches.

transcriptome profiling has previously been conducted in conifers to explore the molecular basis of phenotypic changes  <cit> . in this study, a large-scale custom microarray  containing 60-mer oligonucleotide probes  was designed to represent the p. pinaster transcriptome  <cit> . in parallel, rna-seq was performed using a subset of  <dig>  contigs from sustainpinedb as a reference  <cit> . the platforms have been compared, showing complementary and reliable results. microarray and rna-seq were used to explore transcriptome changes in phenotypically divergent p. pinaster populations grown under the same conditions. a transcriptome-wide analysis was conducted in the needles of two maritime pine provenances from contrasting habitats, leiria and tamrabta, phenotypically divergent and with distinct potential of environmental adaptation. we hypothesize that phenotypic divergence is supported, at least in part, by changes in the transcriptome. the results presented in this study highlight the adaptive responses of the two provenances as a result of their different abilities to sense the environmental conditions, thereby suggesting regulation by different genetic and/or epigenetic backgrounds.

RESULTS
transcriptomic analyses
in this study, we have developed new technical resources for functional genomics analysis of pinus pinaster. a new oligonucleotide microarray  called pinarray <dig>  synthesized by agilent , has been developed to study the transcriptome of maritime pine. this array contains  <dig>  spots including negative and positive controls  and sequences for unique transcripts  in the maritime pine transcriptome included in the sustainpinedb v <dig>   <cit> . to increase specificity, the 3’utr of the transcripts  was used in the design of the 60-mer oligonucleotides. this microarray has been tested with rna samples from adult needles of two geographically distinct populations of maritime pine, leiria and tamrabta, which were chosen for their contrasted habitats and diverse phenotypes . the leiria provenance is from central portugal, in the european atlantic region, and tamrabta is from the moroccan atlas mountains . trees of both provenances were cultivated in the same monitored fields in northern spain where leiria showed higher rates of growth  and survival rate  than tamrabta  and also displayed more heterogeneity.

eight microarray fields were hybridized with  <dig> biological replicates from each provenance in an alternating manner. the raw microarray data were normalized and analyzed using the limma r package  <cit>  resulting in  <dig>  spots with a signal that was significantly different from that of the background . of these,  <dig> spots were considered to represent differentially expressed  genes , with  <dig> showing higher expression in tamrabta  and  <dig> showing higher expression in leiria  . in the samples analyzed there were higher inter-provenance than intra-provenance variations between microarray results in a multidimensional scaling plot . however, tamrabta showed higher variability than leiria likely reflecting the effect of the environment.fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of pinarray <dig> and rna-seq. a comparison of fold changes  between pinarray <dig> and rna-seq analyses. red dots represent ‘false negative’ genes . blue dots represent ‘false positive’ genes . open dots represent ‘true negative’ genes . black dots represent ‘true positive’ genes . the trend line is adjusted to a spearman correlation. b venn diagram showing the results for the de analysis from both pinarray <dig> and rna-seq. c de genes by platform indicating their inclusion in one or both platforms



rna-seq was chosen as the second method of analysis in this transcriptome study. two of the rna samples hybridized with pinarray <dig> were sequenced. a subset of  <dig>  contigs in the sustainpinedb  <cit>  was used as reference transcriptome sequence for read mapping. in total,  <dig>  genes were represented, and  <dig> genes showed differential expression between the provenances . a higher logfc value was used to consider a gene as differential expressed in the rna-seq because of the lower number of replicates . there were  <dig> genes more highly expressed in tamrabta  whereas  <dig> genes showed higher expression levels in leiria . the results are presented in fig. 1b and additional file 2: table s <dig> 

to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of the transcriptomic data obtained, results from both methods were compared using spotfire software. from the expressed transcripts in pinarray <dig> and rna-seq only  <dig>  were shared between both platforms and used for the comparison . the logfc values of these genes had a spearman correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . the spotfire software only used the adjp.value  or fdr  values to divide genes into four categories: ‘false negative’, comprising  <dig> genes ; ‘false positive’, comprising  <dig> genes ; ‘true negative’, comprising  <dig> genes ; and ‘true positive’, comprising  <dig> genes . of the total data compared,  <dig>  % were concordant between the pinarray <dig> and rna-seq  . when the de genes in both platforms were compared with a more restrictive criterion including logfc values ,  <dig> were found to be overexpressed in tamrabta and  <dig> were found to be overexpressed in leiria .

to determine the de genes in each platform, only  <dig>  genes could be used for the comparison. among the  <dig> de genes identified using pinarray <dig>   <dig> genes were differentially expressed according to both analyses and  <dig> only showed differential expression using pinarray <dig> . moreover, of the  <dig> de genes identified using rna-seq,  <dig> were differentially expressed according to both analyses, and  <dig> were only differentially expressed according to rna-seq .

both methods were validated using qpcr analysis  of  <dig> genes, including actin and ef1a. in general, the logfc results obtained via the three methods were similar except for a few cases such as the sp_v <dig> _unigene <dig> or the sp_v <dig> _unigene <dig>  for which the pinarray <dig> data differed from the qpcr and rna-seq data . the pearson correlation between qpcr and pinarray <dig> logfc was significant , with a r index of  <dig>  , and the correlation between qpcr and rna-seq logfc was significant , with a r index of  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> validation of pinarray <dig> and rna-seq analyses by qpcr. a fold changes  of gene expression in leiria and tamrabta provenance samples analyzed using pinarray <dig>  rna-seq and qpcr are shown. each gene is identified by its numeric id in the database sustainpine v <dig> . positive values correspond to higher expression in leiria samples and negative values to higher expression in tamrabta samples. b pearson correlation between logfc values determined from pinarray <dig> and qpcr analysis. c pearson correlation between logfc as determined using rna-seq and qpcr analyses



functional enrichment analysis
gene function enrichment analysis was performed using the mapman categories through the sequence annotation file obtained using the mercator web tool  <cit> . the enrichment analysis results are shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> and in additional file 2: table s <dig>  of the  <dig> mapman categories,  <dig> were represented in the de genes identified using pinarray <dig>   <dig> were found among the de genes identified using rna-seq and only  <dig> fell into the group of common de genes . in all cases the most abundant category was “unassigned genes” . there were  <dig> categories with significant differences between both provenances as determined using pinarray <dig> : secondary metabolism , miscellaneous , signaling , transport  and unassigned genes  . rna-seq analysis yielded  <dig> categories showing significant differences in a fisher’s exact test: photosynthesis , protein  and transport  . none of the categories were significantly different in the common results . except for the category of unassigned genes  in pinarray <dig> and photosynthesis  in rna-seq, where leiria showed more significant genes, the rest of significant categories had more significant genes in tamrabta . in the remaining categories, the differences between provenances were due to the expression of different genes and not to the number of de genes , e.g. hormone metabolism , rna , protein  metabolism and signaling .fig.  <dig> global functional enrichment analysis of the pinarray <dig> and rna-seq results. the horizontal bars represent the percentage of genes included in each functional category. the functional enrichment analysis was based on the functional mapman categories and performed using the fisher’s exact test. significant categories have p-values <  <dig> . the significant categories are shown in red in graphs and in bold in tables. a functional enrichment analysis for pinarray <dig> results. b functional enrichment analysis for rna-seq results. c functional enrichment analysis for significant genes in both pinarray <dig> and rna-seq

to further examine the de genes involved in metabolism and transport, the results were represented in mapman . the secondary metabolism genes  were enhanced in the tamrabta provenance compared to the leiria provenance and genes involved in carbon metabolism  were upregulated in leiria . when depicted using the kegg metabolic maps, the higher expression in tamrabta of genes from the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was especially prominent . in addition, the udp-glycosyltransferases were differentially expressed in tamrabta . with the exception of aquaporins, which were more abundant in leiria than in tamrabta, transport-related genes were more abundant in tamrabta .

based on the pinarray <dig> and rna-seq analyses, genes involved in light sensing or circadian rhythms were well represented in the group of de genes. although the orthologues of gigantea  and lhy/cca  were expressed at higher levels in leiria, the rest of the genes involved in these processes were expressed more highly in tamrabta than in leiria . examples include prr <dig> , elf <dig> , hy <dig> , ft , chalcone synthase , elip  and pap <dig> . the qpcr and transcriptomic expression data for this group of genes were consistent, as shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> kegg representation of the plant circadian rhythm including de genes. schematic view of the regulation pathway of the plant circadian rhythm including de genes from pinarray <dig> and rna-seq. red boxes indicate genes with higher expression in leiria samples and green lines indicate genes with higher expression in tamrabta samples. mapman boxes show the logfc results from the qpcr analysis



levels of secondary metabolites and hormones
the differential expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in secondary metabolism prompted us to determine the relative levels of flavonoids and phenylpropanoids in the two maritime pine provenances  using two different methods previously reported  <cit> . although the traditional alcl <dig> method cannot detect flavanones, it is used for quantification of total flavonoids. the  <dig> -dinitrophenylhydrazine colorimetric method measures flavanones independently of other of flavonoids  <cit> . there were no significant differences in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid accumulation between leiria and tamrabta, although the amounts were slightly higher in leiria . however, there was a significant difference in the accumulation of flavanones, with significantly higher levels present in leiria than in tamrabta .fig.  <dig> flavonoids and phenylpropanoids in the needles of leiria and tamrabta. boxplots show the levels of total flavonoids, flavanones and phenylpropanoids in needles from the leiria and tamrabta provenances. significant differences were calculated using student’s t-test. significant differences are shown with a single asterisk for p-values <  <dig> 



because the hormone metabolism category included a high number of de genes  , hormone levels were determined in the needles of leiria and tamrabta. this included measurement of abscisic acid, castasterone, cytokinins, gibberellins, indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and an evaluation of the relationship between indoleacetic acid and cytokinins. significant differences were observed for abscisic acid , gibberellins , jasmonic acid  and salicylic acid , and the levels were always higher in leiria than in tamrabta .fig.  <dig> hormones in the needles of leiria and tamrabta. boxplots show the levels of asbcisic acid , castosterone, cytokinins, gibberellins , indoleacetic acid , jasmonic acid  and salicylic acid  and the indoleacetic acid:cytokinins index in needles from the leiria and tamrabta provenances. significant differences were calculated using student’s t-test. significant differences are shown with a single asterisk for p-values <  <dig>  and two asterisks for p-values <  <dig> 



discussion
comparison of pinarray <dig> and rna-seq data
in this study, we used two different approaches for transcriptome profiling in maritime pine : microarray  analysis and rna-seq. these two approaches were based on the de novo assembly of transcriptome data available at sustainpinedb, the p. pinaster gene expression database  <cit> , and proved to be powerful tools for producing reliable functional results with a good correlation . the comparison of microarray and rna-seq data with data obtained from qpcr analysis showed very strong correlations, validating the power of both techniques’ analysis of gene expression on a genome-wide scale. the qpcr data support the differential expression of genes that were only identified in pinarray <dig> and also of genes that were only identified in rna-seq . all these data indicate that the selected genes were not false positives and further suggest a low number of false positives in our transcriptomic analyses. however, rna-seq presented better correlations with qpcr than did pinarray <dig> . this may indicate technical limitations of microarray analysis due to the use of nucleotide hybridization, which can introduce biases such as cross-hybridization of multiple labeled target transcripts to the same probe, increasing the rate of false positives and diminishing the quantification precision in regard to rna-seq. despite the low number of biological replicates  in the rna-seq compared to microarray method , the reliability of the results supports further use of rna-seq  <cit> .

rna-seq and microarray analysis have been proposed to be complementary methods for transcriptome profiling  <cit> . although pinarray <dig> and the rna-seq reference transcriptomes represent approximately 90 % of the protein-coding genes of maritime pine and both were selected from the same database , the methods for contig selection were different resulting in different sequence pools as reflected in fig.  <dig>  this is due to the lack of complete and reliable gene annotation in conifers, although the sequencing and assembly of three genomes have recently been published . the lack of a reference genome hinders the implementation of sequencing-based techniques, such as rna-seq, in genome-wide analyses and supports the use of de novo assemblies for rna-seq studies . nevertheless, sustainpinedb has yielded good results, thereby validating the database construction and making the microarray and rna-seq data more comparable.

analysis of the leiria and tamrabta transcriptomes
pinarray <dig> and rna-seq were used to compare transcriptomes from the needles of two different p. pinaster provenances, leiria and tamrabta, which have different geographical origins and phenotypes . p. pinaster is a forest tree species with a fragmented distribution that limits gene flow between populations and likely increase the genetic divergence between ecotypes . however, a recent study about resistance to cavitation in p. pinaster has shown that genetic and phenotypic differentiation for certain traits are limited  <cit> . leiria and tamrabta were grown in the same place under the same environmental conditions and, consequently, few differences in gene expression were observed between the two provenances . the percentage of de genes was very similar in the two platforms used , confirming the reliability of both genomic tools for transcriptome analysis in maritime pine samples

the analysis of functional categories revealed differences in adaptation responses to environmental conditions between the two maritime pine provenances. in general, metabolite transport appeared to be increased in tamrabta. however, the increased expression of aquaporins  in leiria suggest significant differences in the management of water and co <dig> . it has been observed that aqp-overexpressing plants have higher photosynthetic rates and faster growth  <cit> . consistent with these observations, leiria grew taller and showed increased expression of photosynthesis-related genes compared to tamrabta . phenologically, leiria matures earlier than tamrabta, especially in unfavorable conditions such as cold weather. however, under optimal conditions tamrabta completes its growth cycle more rapidly. to compensate for its weaker adaptive capacity, tamrabta has evolved to complete the growth cycle during periods of favorable light and temperature. in contrast, leiria, which is more suited to atlantic conditions, grows for a longer period and reaches a greater height. however, the higher ga content in leiria correlates with increased elongation rather than an increase in the number of whorls.

the precedent findings suggest that leiria tends to use more water  and that tamrabta uses less . water saver plants reduce gas conductance and transpiration by maintaining constant minimum relative water content and leaf water potential under conditions of water stress. this results in decreased photosynthesis and lower growth rates. in contrast, water expender plants always maintain a high evaporative demand, allowing a decrease in leaf water content during drought to maintain high photosynthesis and growth rates  <cit> . unsurprisingly, the water saver strategy is typical of plants from arid zones, and plants without water supply problems usually adopt the water expender behavior. moreover, leiria demonstrated no down-regulation of aqp gene expression in response to aba and accumulated higher levels of aqp, which is an additional characteristic of water expender plants . this suggests that even drought-tolerant species can have different intraspecific responses to water stress. it has been observed that pinus radiata  has an aba-driven stomatal closure during water stress, which is a typical water saving behavior. in contrast, in callitris rhomboidea , stomatal closure is induced by increased aba levels, which decline with prolonged water stress. therefore, the stomatal closure in this species is driven by water potential, which is a water-expender behavior  <cit> . because leiria and tamrabta were grown under the same conditions, the differential response observed may be explained by the high plasticity of the response of p. pinaster to environmental conditions, and this response would possibly be under genetic and epigenetic control.

consistent with the argument above, the de gene and functional enrichment analyses also suggest that the adaptations provide different capacity to sense environmental conditions. therefore, the differential expression of several genes involved in light signaling may result from this phenomenon . moreover, the differences in the accumulation of hormones such as aba, ja and sa  that are involved in uv-b responses also support this hypothesis  <cit> . the finding of different hormone levels between provenances is according with previous works about ja accumulation in p. pinaster  <cit> . because the latitudes of the maritime pine provenances studied here are very different, their responses to photoperiod and light intensity must also be different. among conifer populations from different latitudes, an allele frequency cline and divergent expression patterns of ftl <dig>  a member of the terminal flower  <dig> gene family involved in the photoperiod sensing, has been observed in norway spruce and scots pine  <cit> . in the present study, one member of the terminalflower  <dig> family, flt <dig> , was overexpressed in tamrabta . based on our results, the higher expression of the conifer lhy-cca <dig> homolog gene  in leiria may indicate different adaptation to light conditions between provenances . it is known that lhy  and cca <dig>  are transcription factors involved in the circadian clock and cold acclimation in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, in picea abies the unique conifer lhy/cca <dig> homolog  showed diurnal expression cycles but no strong circadian clock, with rapid dampening in free-running conditions  <cit> . because the epigenetic control of these signaling routes is well known  <cit> , it is conceivable that the differences observed between leiria and tamrabta may be partially due to epigenetic responses since this work has been made with clonal propagated individuals grown in a greenhouse under the same environmental conditions.

an additional indication of the higher adaptive capacity of leiria to varying growth conditions is the profile of de genes involved in lipid metabolism. in tamrabta, genes encoding enzymes directly involved in the oxidative phosphorylation and membrane proteins involved in the atp/energy metabolism associated to oxidative phosphorylation were overexpressed . this type of response is induced during winter when the energy produced by photosynthesis decreases, necessitating new sources of energy . in addition, the levels of the growth hormones ga were lower in tamrabta , and ga synthesis in plants is known to be inhibited by cold  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that southern provenances may respond more slowly to photoperiod as previously observed in norway spruce and scots pine  <cit> .

consistent with these findings the accumulation of flavanones  was higher in leiria than in tamrabta . in plants flavonoid amount and profile can change due to uv-b stress mediated by hormones such as aba, ja and sa  <cit> . however, several genes involved in secondary metabolism, mainly in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, were expressed at higher levels in tamrabta than in leiria . these results suggest that the difference in flavonoid profiles between tamrabta and leiria is due to genetic and/or epigenetic differences in their response to environmental stimuli. accordingly, the miscellaneous category of genes  contains an important representation of genes for udp-glycosyltransferases and glutathione-s-transferases, which are more expressed in the tamrabta provenance . udp-glycosyltransferases are key enzymes that dictate differences in the structure of flavonoids  <cit> . modifications in flavonoid structure and composition may constitute a chemical fingerprint for the p. pinaster varieties or provenances.

CONCLUSIONS
whole-transcriptome resources are now accessible for non-classical model organisms. in this study, oligonucleotide microarrays and rna-seq analyses were used to characterize the maritime pine  transcriptome, for which they produced reliable results. transcriptome profiling of needle samples from two maritime pine provenances validated both genomic platforms and elucidated the genetic basis of the differences in environmental adaptation between them. the observed differences in gene expression between leiria and tamrabta supported the hypothesis that genetic and epigenetic factors of the provenances play a significant role in the modulation of specific responses to environmental conditions.
