BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions play fundamental roles in signal transduction, formation of functional protein complexes and protein modification  <cit> . one of the most common protein interaction domains in the cell is pdz domain which is a central signaling protein of most species  <cit> . the pdz domains, among other nearly  <dig> distinct recognition domains, are crucial because they are involved in development of multi-cellular organisms by constructing cell polarity, coordination of intercellular signaling system and directing the specificity of signaling proteins  <cit> . they consist of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and have a compact globular fold composed of a core of six β strands  and two α helices . by binding the c-terminal motifs of their target proteins, pdz domains target, cluster and route these proteins  <cit> . however, some pdz domains also can bind to the internal motifs of target proteins, lipids and other pdz domains  <cit> .

c-terminus of a peptide recognizes and binds to a pocket between carboxylate-binding loop  that contains the conserved glgf motif, and αb helix of the pdz domain  <cit> , this is also called the canonical binding. the ligand binds to the pdz domain as an anti-parallel extension of the β-sheet of the domain and while ligand positions - <dig> and - <dig> head towards to the solvent, the positions  <dig> and - <dig> point towards to the binding pocket  <cit>  . therefore, it can be suggested that ligand positions  <dig> and - <dig> are very crucial for recognition and binding to target proteins. the importance of these two positions also lead to the general classification of pdz domains into three classes according to short peptide motifs of the last three residues at the extreme c-termini of their peptide ligands. class i pdz domains bind to c terminal motifs with the sequence of , class ii pdzs bind to the sequence of  and class iii pdzs prefer the sequence of  where Φ is any hydrophobic amino acid and x is any amino acid. however, some pdz domain interactions do not satisfy these restrictive types of recognition and so additional classes and additional important residues are proposed to exist for ligand specificity of pdz domains  <cit> . for example, songyang et al. investigated the binding specificities of nine pdz domains by using an oriented peptide library and concluded that additional selection specificities, depending on up to - <dig> position of the peptide ligand, were observed beside the  <dig> and - <dig> positions  <cit> .

although pdz domains show selectivity toward their target ligands, they also display promiscuity, binding to more than one ligand, and degenerate specificity  <cit> , so interaction prediction of these domains can be challenging. several studies aimed to classify and predict interaction specificity of pdz domains that could save time-consuming and expensive experiments. chen et al.  <cit>  predicted pdz domain-peptide interactions from primary sequences of pdz domains and peptides by using a statistical model and reported an area under curve  value of  <dig>  for extrapolations to both novel mouse peptides and pdz domains. bezprozvanny and maximov  <cit>  used a classification method based on the two critical positions of  <dig> pdz domains and they presented  <dig> different classes of pdz domains. stiffler et al.  <cit>  tried to characterize the binding selectivity of pdz domains by training multi-domain selectivity model for  <dig> mouse pdz domains with respect to  <dig> peptides and they indicated that pdz domains are distributed throughout the selectivity space contrary to discrete specificity classes. schillinger et al.  <cit>  used a new approach, domain interaction footprint , to predict binding peptides of sh <dig> and pdz domains by using only the sequence of the peptides and they reported an auc value of  <dig>  for pdz multi-domain model by using the sequence information of binding and non-binding peptides of four different pdz domains. tonikian et al.  <cit>  constructed a specificity map consisting of  <dig> unique specificity classes for  <dig> pdz domains and this lead to the prediction of pdz domain interactions. wiedemann et al.  <cit>  tried to quantify specificity of three pdz domains by relating the last four c-terminal motifs of their ligands to the corresponding dissociation constants which can provide selectivity pattern of pdz domains and design of super-binding peptides. eo et al.  <cit>  used an svm classifier by adapting amino acid contact matrices and physiochemical distance matrix as a feature encoding in order to identify pdz domain ligand interactions.

in this study, we propose a method to predict pdz domain-peptide interactions by using only the sequence information of pdz domains and ligands. in order to construct a numerical feature vector for each interaction, trigram and bigram frequencies of each primary sequence of pdz domains and peptides are calculated. we obtain a high prediction performance  distinguishing between binding and non-binding peptides of pdz domains. we make use of the most commonly used classifiers  and find random forest classifier with the best prediction accuracy. moreover, we show that our method can be efficiently used to distinguish between class i, class ii and class i-ii pdzs  with an accuracy of  <dig> % and auc of  <dig>  for trigram model.

methods
dataset
for interaction prediction part, a positive  and a negative  dataset are needed in our machine learning model. the pdz interaction dataset is retrieved from the study of stiffler et al., which is composed of interaction data of  <dig> mouse pdz domains with respect to  <dig> mouse genome-encoded peptides  <cit> . they used the combination of protein microarrays and fluorescence polarization  methods to identify biological interactions of pdz domains. in the current study, only binding and non-binding information that were confirmed by fp is used as the training set due to the fidelity of fp. after selection of fp confirmed interactions, we obtained  <dig> binding and  <dig> non-binding interactions between  <dig> pdz domains and  <dig> peptides .

an independent validation dataset is also used in interaction prediction part in order to test the predictive performance of our model. the validation dataset is extracted from the previous study of stiffler et al. and it is composed of  <dig> binding and  <dig> non-binding interactions of  <dig> pdz domains and  <dig> peptides  <cit>  .

for class prediction part,  <dig> pdz domains are categorized, resulting in  <dig> class i,  <dig> class ii,  <dig> class i-ii. these are retrieved from our interaction dataset and pdzbase  <cit>  by looking at their interactions with different classes of peptides. pdz domains are annotated as class i and class ii according to the c terminus sequence of the interacting peptides,  for class i peptides and  for class ii peptides, respectively. class i-ii pdz domains are determined if they bind to both class i and class ii peptides. .

in order to be consistent in our interaction prediction model, we took the last  <dig> residues of each peptide sequence due to the selection specificities of pdz domains up to - <dig> positions of peptides. the sequence data of pdz domains and peptides can be seen in additional file 2: table s <dig> and table s <dig>  respectively.

feature encoding
frequencies of consecutive three amino acids  and two amino acids  in the primary sequences are used as features. for instance, a sequence of "abcde" results in a trigram set of "abc", "bcd", "cde" and a bigram set of "ab", "bc", "cd" and "de". in order to reduce the dimension of the features,  <dig> amino acids are clustered into  <dig> different classes  according to their dipoles and volumes of the side chains which reflect their interaction specificity by giving an insight about their electrostatic and hydrophobic natures  <cit> .

*cys is differentiated from class  <dig> because it can form disulfide bonds

to calculate trigram frequency of the pdz and corresponding peptide sequences, the number of occurrence of each subsequent trigram in the sequence is counted, and this number is divided by the total number of trigrams in the sequence which is , where n is the sequence length. at the end, we obtain  <dig>  features for each sequence because amino acids are clustered into seven classes resulting in  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> different combination of trigrams. for the interaction prediction part, feature vector space is constructed by combining trigram frequency sets of both pdz domain and corresponding peptide which gave  <dig> features for each interaction . for bigram frequency calculation, the same procedure is applied and we obtained  <dig>  features for each sequence and a total of  <dig> features  are constructed for each interaction. therefore, we constructed a feature vector space  to represent an interaction:  

here, x is the feature vector space of the pdz sequence, and each feature xi represents the frequency of each trigram where i =  <dig>   <dig> ....,  <dig> or each bigram where i =  <dig>   <dig> ...,  <dig>  y is the feature vector space of peptide sequence, each feature yi represents the frequency of each trigram or bigram, and w is the corresponding label that contains binary data . thus, a  <dig> dimensional vector for trigram part and a  <dig> dimensional vector for bigram part are constructed to represent each binding/non-binding interaction.

for the class prediction part, the peptide sequences are discarded and only the sequences of pdz domains are used to construct the feature vector space, because peptide sequences are used as the label of the dataset. therefore, a  <dig> dimensional vector space for trigram part and  <dig> for bigram part with three labels  are built to represent each class of pdz domains.

model comparison
there are several machine learning approaches to predict domain interactions  <cit> . we chose five classifiers, svm , nearest neighbor, naïve bayes, j <dig> and random forest which have been commonly used in protein-protein interaction prediction problems. in svm algorithm, feature vectors are non-linearly mapped on a high dimensional feature space and a set of hyperplanes are constructed to be used for classification or regression  <cit> . the simplest one among used classifiers is nearest neighbor which classifies instances according to their closeness to the training examples  <cit> . the basic idea behind naïve bayes is to predict the class of an instance by learning conditional probability of each attribute  <cit> . j <dig>  also known as c <dig>  grows an initial tree by using divide-and-conquer algorithm and then rank test instances  <cit> . random forest developed by breiman  <cit>  generates many classification trees simultaneously where each node uses a random subset of the features and outputs the classification based on majority voting over all trees in the forest. after comparison of these different classifiers by using weka  <dig>   <cit> , random forest algorithm was found to outperform other classifiers which were previously shown to be the best classification algorithm   <cit> .

each classifier is trained by using a 10-fold cross-validation. cross-validation measures the prediction performance in a stable way by leaving out a few instances  to be used as the test set during the training process. the exclusion is repeated until every instance in the dataset is once among those left-outs. in comparison to using an independent test set, cross-validation provides less bias and a better predictive performance. parameter selection for each classifier is done by varying their parameters step-by-step and their accuracy and auc  values are compared to obtain the best parameters with the highest performance . at the end, the classifier with the best performance is chosen as the model classifier.

the number of true positives , true negatives , false positives  and false negatives  are used to calculate true positive rate , tpr = tp/, false positive rate, fpr = fp/ and precision, p = tp/. we measure the performance of each classifier by using a roc curve which is drawn as tpr  versus fpr . the area under the roc curve, referred as auc, represents the predictive power: while a random predictive model has an auc =  <dig> , a perfect one has an auc =  <dig>  so that a larger auc shows a better predictive power. however, roc curves can sometimes be misleading while dealing with highly unbalanced datasets. therefore, precision versus recall  curves are also constructed to interpret the performance of models in a more informative manner  <cit> . pr curves show how many true positives are likely to be obtained in a prediction system.

RESULTS
interaction prediction model
random forest is chosen to build our model due to its highest auc and accuracy values . to optimize the parameters of random forest algorithm, we evaluate the effect of changes in parameters on its prediction performance by measuring out-of-bag  error rate of each model tree. there are two parameters: number of trees  and number of randomly selected features . the number of features to be used in random selection is rather sensitive and it must be much lower than the total number of features  <cit> . on the other hand, the changes in the number of trees can result only in small decreases in oob error rate. the lowest oob error rate is obtained when numtree =  <dig> and numfeature =  <dig> . also, resampling is applied as a pre-process in order to take care of our imbalanced dataset which could be overwhelmed by the major class otherwise and to derive robust estimates of standard errors. resampling is a supervised filter producing a random subset of the dataset. in our study, class distribution is left as-is and sampling is done with replacement by adjusting the parameters.

the accuracy of trigram part  is slightly higher than the bigram part  . so, we design our model according to trigram frequency feature space. our result of auc =  <dig>  for trigram part is high enough to be able to characterize pdz binding specificity . also, we validate the power of our model by predicting the interaction of an unseen validation dataset. the model performs well on the validation set with an accuracy of  <dig> % that it correctly classifies  <dig> of  <dig> binding and  <dig> of  <dig> non-binding interactions . the performance of bigram model is somehow lower in validation dataset compared to trigrams. this may be due to the fact that bigrams assign more common features for most of the interactions by probably masking the discriminative features.

class prediction model
there is a multi-classification problem for class prediction because we do not only want to discriminate between pdz domains which bind to class i or class ii, but also we want to class i-ii domains whose interaction specificity reflects the promiscuous pattern of pdz domains. all five classifiers are trained on these classification datasets and again random forest gives the best predictive performance with the highest auc and accuracy values .

the random forest model is used to discriminate both multi-classes  and binary classes  in order to have an insight about their pair wise classifications. as seen in table  <dig>  the predictive performance for multi-class learning is a bit lower than binary-class ones which are very close to each other and the trigram model has still better performance than those of the bigram model. as we are trying to distinguish all three classes of pdz domains, we obtain the performance results of trigram model for multi-class learning . the model correctly classifies  <dig> of  <dig> class i,  <dig> of  <dig> class ii and  <dig> of  <dig> class i-ii pdz domains. the results of binary comparisons, in table  <dig>  show that the highest accuracy is for differentiating class ii pdzs from class i-ii pdzs and the least successful one is between class i and class i-ii. this means that amino acid distribution of class i-ii pdzs is slightly more similar to class i pdzs. to ensure this similarity, amino acid frequency distribution histogram for class i/ii/i-ii pdz domains is plotted .

*the first row shows a multi-class learning and remaining rows shows the binary-class learning for pair wise combinations of three classes. for multi-class learning, weighted average results were shown.

dimensionality reduction
in order to make the resulting model faster and extract important features, dimensionality of our dataset is reduced by using feature selection methods  <cit> . selection of important features can help us to get rid of redundant and/or irrelevant data. as the first step of feature selection, a correlation-based feature subset selection method is used to evaluate the individual performance of each feature for predicting labels  as well as the level of intercorrelation among all features. successful feature subsets include features highly correlated with the label, but uncorrelated with each other  <cit> . in the second step of feature selection part, several search algorithms are performed and results of all of them are considered in order to reduce features carefully. the search methods that are used are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

feature selection  is applied to both trigram and bigram models because we want to observe important common features of both models. for the trigram model, we obtained  <dig> features for pdz domain and  <dig> features for peptides to be used in interaction prediction part. also,  <dig> trigram features, for the classification part, are obtained .

for the bigram model, there are  <dig> features for pdz domain and  <dig> features for peptides for the interaction prediction part and  <dig> features for the classification part. the accuracy values of our model did not increase after feature reduction for both interaction prediction and classification parts except trigram classification model . however, reduction in feature space helps us analyze these selected important features to determine critical sequence motifs.

critical sequence motifs
we analyzed the selected features to understand why they are important to distinguish different pdz interactions and classes. these extracted features might correspond to some critical amino acid motifs which may be important for pdz domain interaction specificity. indeed, one of the features points out the glgf  repeat of pdz domains which is an important conserved region for peptide interaction  <cit> . this conserved glgf sequence is located between βa-βb loop and αb helix and directly involved in peptide selectivity and binding. in order to determine important motifs, like the glgf motif, we first find the common selected features of trigram and bigram models. next, we perform multiple sequence alignment of all pdz domains and we determine the conserved motifs  on the similar secondary structure regions. we observe that conserved bigrams are also parts of the conserved trigrams, i.e. there are some highly occurring bigrams in both trigram and bigram feature sets for interaction prediction and classification parts. by looking at the most conserved ones, we obtain sequence motifs of "12", "16" and "25"  where the numbers in the motifs correspond to amino acid types and can be found in table  <dig>  for example, motif "12" corresponds to small hydrophobic amino acid  followed by large hydrophobic amino acid .

as seen in figure  <dig>  characteristic glgf repeat of pdz domains was determined by extracting sequence motif of "12" between βa-βb loop and αb helix. other two highly occurring sequence motifs were positioned at the end of the αb  and at the loop between αa and βd . when these sequence motifs are displayed on the 3d structure of pdz domains, motif "25" is positioned near the binding groove , while motif "16" is positioned far from the binding groove  .

extracted motif on αb helix could function in specificity of pdz domains. songyang et al. investigated the importance of αb helix on peptide selectivity of pdz domains by showing high correlation between first residue in the αb helix and peptide position - <dig>  <cit> . below, we discuss some specific pdz domains:

α1-syntrophin
the specific interaction property of α1-syntrophin pdz domain was investigated by schultz et al. and they found that leu  <dig>  gly  <dig> and ile  <dig> showed a large chemical shift upon binding of ligand  <cit> . pdz domain of α1-syntrophin forms hydrophobic pocket consisting of leu  <dig>  ile  <dig> and leu  <dig> to bury the side chain of val - <dig> of the peptide. motif "12" corresponds to gly  <dig>  ile  <dig> and "5" of motif "25" corresponds to leu  <dig> which is an important part of the hydrophobic pocket.

nherf
first pdz domain of nherf <dig> plays important role in cellular localization by binding to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator   <cit> . leu  <dig> of the ligand forms hydrophobic contact with phe  <dig> and ile  <dig> and makes h-bonds with gly  <dig>  phe  <dig> and arg  <dig>  these important residues were also extracted by using our method: while motif "12" in βb corresponds to gly  <dig>  phe  <dig>  motif "25" in αb exactly corresponds to ile  <dig>  arg  <dig> 

harmonin
pan et al. tried to elucidate structural basis of binding pattern of harmonin and found that carboxyl group of cad  <dig> ligand forms hydrogen bonds with leu  <dig>  glu  <dig>  cys  <dig>  and is stabilized by lys  <dig>  <cit> . these important residues of harmonin were also observed in our motifs as seen from figure  <dig> .

pick1
the carboxyl group of ligand forms hydrogen bonds with ile  <dig>  gly  <dig> and ile  <dig> of pick <dig> pdz domain  <cit> . while gly  <dig> and ile  <dig> constitute motif "12", we observed motif "24" on αb helix instead of motif "25".

ptp-bl
gianni et al. investigated allosteric property of ptp-bl domain by using structural and dynamical methods and found that binding is regulated by long range interactions which showed correlation with ligand-induced structural rearrangements  <cit> . there is a detectable conformational change, dominantly occurring in αb-βb interface, l <dig> loop and hydrophobic core, upon ligand binding to ptp-bl domain. plasticity and selectivity of ptp-bl domain are usually determined by reorientation of alpha b helix. amides of leu  <dig>  gly  <dig> and ile  <dig> stabilize the charge of c-terminus of the ligand and there is a hydrophobic contact between c-terminal peptide valine and leu  <dig>  val  <dig> positions. in our study, motif "12" in βb corresponds to the gly  <dig>  ile  <dig> and "5" of motif "25" in αb corresponds to leu  <dig> as seen figure  <dig> 

discussion
our results show that our model can be used as a stable interaction prediction model of pdz domains with higher accuracy than other similar methods  <cit> . we also proposed a classification model for pdz domains based on the general classification pattern unlike other methods  <cit>  and the result with high accuracy indicates that our classification model highly correlates with the current classification pattern of pdz domains. although pdz domains show highly selective interaction pattern, there are some pdz domains which bind to both class i and class ii peptides. we named these promiscuous pdz domains as class i-ii pdz domains and obtained a very high performance when discriminating them among other classes. therefore, it is concluded that there may be some characteristic pattern in the structure of class i-ii pdz domains that provide its promiscuous property.

some important characteristic features of pdz domains were extracted. after selection of most occurring features along the same secondary structure region of pdz domains, we obtained three critical sequence motifs. two of them  were previously shown to have an important role in ligand interaction. motif "12" is on conserved glgf repeat and located between βa-βb loop and motif "25" is located on αb which is one of the parts of binding pocket. there is not any previous study investigating the importance of motif "16" which is positioned on αa-βd loop. after multiple alignment of pdz domain sequences, it was observed that motif "16" on αa-βd loop is conserved as shown in another study  <cit> . although this motif does not locate near the canonical binding pocket, it could be involved in dimerization of pdz domains which is a common characteristic for some pdz domains  <cit> . in the study of im et al., it was shown that the dimeric interface of grip <dig> pdz <dig> dimer include a βa strand and αa-βd loop from each domain, and motif "16" is located on this αa-βd loop of grip <dig> pdz <dig> domain. also, it could have an allosteric effect regulating the binding specificity of pdz domains  <cit> . however, further study has to be performed in order to reveal biological importance of this motif.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has two intercorrelated aims: prediction of pdz domain-peptide interactions, and classification of pdz domains as class i, ii and i-ii. a statistical learning model was constructed by using interaction dataset of pdz domains . to convert primary sequence information into numerical feature input, trigram and bigram amino acid frequencies were calculated for each instance. we predicted binary interactions and classes of pdz domains with accuracies of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. after feature extraction, three critical amino acid sequence motifs were proposed to have significant roles on pdz domain specificity. with these highly encouraging results, this study could be an important step in the automated prediction of pdz domain interactions.

the discovery of features within primary sequences of known protein interaction pairs could be subsequently developed by using other features  in the learning model. further improvements on these lines may generate a powerful computational virtual screening technique that significantly reduces the search space for putative candidate target proteins of pdz domains.
