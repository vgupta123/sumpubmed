BACKGROUND
predicting tumor response to radiotherapy is one of the major issues in cancer treatment. predicting radiosensitivity is important for improving clinical outcome and for personalized medicine decisions of the treatment needed, doses, and fractionation schedules  <cit> . understanding the mechanism of radiosensitiviy is also a major issue in identifying effective biomarkers and potential drug targets of radiosensitivity  <cit> .

assays evaluating radiosensitivity have been developed and tested over the last 25 years  <cit> . recently, comprehensive gene expression analysis with high-throughput technology has been used to identify radiosensitivity classifiers as well as to elucidate the radiosensitivity mechanism in many cancer types including colorectal, cervical, breast, head and neck cancer  <cit> . as treatment response is related to the complex genetic biology of the cancer and host, biological interaction and factors that determine tumor response through the simultaneous genetic analysis of thousands of genes should be considered in predicting treatment outcome. the cancer cell line panel of the national cancer institute  has been widely used for drug screening based on relevant gene expression  <cit> . although promising, these studies are confined to a single platform microarray and further validation and a larger dataset are needed. moreover, individually identifying every gene with a statistically significant response is not sufficient as a biological explanation. for this reason, gene set analysis is necessary, along with defining the biological processes or pathways in expression analysis.

in this study, to identify a common radiosensitivity gene signature and relevant biological processes from a large amount of data from multiple platforms, we analyzed four types of transcript microarray data from radiosensitivity profiling of the nci- <dig> cell line panel. differentially expressed genes, depending on the radiosensitivity index  were identified using a linear regression model. we hypothesized their roles in radiosensitivity using gene set analysis and pathway analysis.

RESULTS
selection of a common radiosensitivity signature from four microarray platforms
the study design is in figure  <dig>  four published microarray experiments were reanalyzed to identify genes whose expression correlated with radiosensitivity in nci- <dig> cancer cell lines. the sf <dig> radiosensitivity index was determined from previously published literature  <cit>  and considered as a continuous variable ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  for gene selection, significant analysis of microarrays  was applied at the false discovery rate  of ≤ <dig> . this resulted in  <dig> genes commonly identified regardless of platforms and  <dig> selected from more than three platforms . differences in gene expression between definitely radiosensitive and radioresistant cells by principal component analysis  showed that approximately the top 10% of radiosensitive  cell lines were distinguished from the bottom 10% of radioresistant lines  using the  <dig> signature genes . of these genes,  <dig> genes were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated in radiosensitive cell lines . reduced expression in a radiosensitive cells meant that decreased gene expression was observed in radiosensitive cells relative to radioresistant cells. likewise, upregulation meant increased gene expression in radiosensitive cells relative to radioresistant cells. this was determined as the slope of the correlation coefficient between sf <dig> and gene expression. the scatter plots showing relationships between sf <dig> and gene expression of the  <dig> radiosensitivity signature genes in the four microarrays are in additional files  <dig>  and  <dig> 

“down” refers to decreased expression observed in radiosensitive cells relative to radioresistant cells, determined as the slope of the correlation coefficient. “up” refers to increased expression in radiosensitive cells.

integrative functional gene set analysis using a global test
to explain the biological processes and signaling pathways of radiosensitivity, a gene set functional study using a global test  <cit>  was applied. the selected gene set was defined from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways. the adjusted p-value corrected for multiple comparisons using the benjamini and hochberg method  <cit>  is in table  <dig>  several radiation-related functions were enriched including the cell cycle, dna replication, cell junction, and cell adhesion . in addition, several molecular pathways were overrepresented including the integrin, vascular endothelial growth factor , mitogen-activated protein kinase , p <dig>  and wnt signaling pathways .

adhesion-related molecules as major components in a radiosensitivty signature
to integrate the top-down and bottom-up approach,  <dig> radiosensitivity signature genes found through sam analysis were compared with the gene sets found in the global test. eight genes were functionally annotated in the global test, and their major function was examined according to kegg pathways . the common function was related to cell junctions and adhesion, suggesting that adhesion-related molecules might have a major role in the mechanism of radiosensitivity.

genetic network interaction with adhesion-related molecules in the integrin signaling pathway
to generate a genetic network for radiosensitivity, we performed ontology analysis using  <dig> genes that were selected from more than three platforms using sam analysis. statistical ranking with canonical pathways was performed using ingenuity pathway analysis  . overrepresented pathways were adhesion-related pathways including the integrin, actin-cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion kinase -signaling pathway. in addition, the cell cycle and p <dig> signaling pathways important to radiosensitivity were also identified. to identify the influence of each gene on the integrin signaling pathway, which was the most overrepresented pathway, a gene plot was produced using the gene set determine from the global test . among the  <dig> signature genes, several were enriched, including actn <dig>  capns <dig>  itgb <dig>  ralb, which were downregulated, and was, which was upregulated in radiosensitive cell lines. genetic network interaction showed that adhesion-related molecules in table  <dig> were involved in the integrin-signaling pathway, and that interaction existed with other signaling pathways such as the pi3k, wnt, and mapk signaling pathways, which were enriched, as shown in table 2b .

discussion
the discovery of potential biomarkers and the elucidation of the mechanisms of radiosensitivity are important to developing radiosensitizers as well for predicting tumor response in radiation oncology  <cit> . we reanalyzed four published microarray studies to identify a common radiosensitivity signature regardless of platform. this strengthened the reliability of our analysis. using sam, we examined each gene individually to show that the correlation with sf <dig> was significant. next, we performed a gene set analysis using a global test based on a linear regression model with a well-defined gene set from kegg pathways. a combination of both analyses found that adhesion-related molecules and several cancer-related molecular pathways were significantly enriched for radiosensitivity and these molecules were linked via the integrin signaling pathway. using both a top-down and bottom-up approach increases the ability to determine genes and signaling pathways that are biologically explainable and statistically acceptable.

several studies have reported possible radiosensitivity predictive genes  <cit> . however, no gene is common among the previous reports. therefore, we used four microarrays to find genes commonly identified as significant in radiosensitivity. we identified  <dig> common genes as well as  <dig> genes that were selected in more than three studies . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were previously reported  <cit>  . comparing the  <dig> genes with previous reports, the cell cycle genes ccna <dig> and cdk <dig> in esophageal cancer  <cit> , and the ras-related gene rac <dig> in rectal cancer  <cit>  were common. other genes that were reported previously could also be possible drug targets. the  <dig> signature genes had cellular functions including cell cycle and dna repair, cell junction, and cell adhesion. cyclin d <dig>  is well known as a dna repair gene and might sensitize human cancers to radiation by limiting dna repair  <cit> . in breast cancer, overexpression of cyclin d induces radiation resistance by inhibiting apoptosiss  <cit> . in our analysis, ccnd <dig> was downregulated in radiosensitive cell lines, consistent with this explanation. annexins including anxa <dig> and anxa <dig> are family of ca2+-regulated membrane-binding proteins that interact with the cellular membrane. anxa <dig>  in particular, is related to induction of apoptosis and is used as an apoptosis marker  <cit> . actn1washcls1rab <dig>  and pfn <dig> are involved with cellular junctions and the actin cytoskeleton, and ptprc is known for interacting with cell adhesion molecules. cellular adhesion-mediated radioresistance is proposed to generate anti-apoptotic signals when integrin-mediated adhesion interacts with the extracellular matrix   <cit> .

integrins are adhesion molecules localized in the plasma membrane, and are heterodimeric glycoprotein receptors of α- and β-subunits. they directly bind to the ecm and contribute to proliferation, survival, and invasion in cancer  <cit> . in radiation biology, several studies report integrins as prognostic or therapeutic markers in several cancer types including breast, head and neck, prostate, lung, and colon cancer  <cit> . in addition to integrin β <dig>  which was included in our identified  <dig> genes and the most studied relative to radiosensitivity, our study identified integrin β <dig>  as a radiosensitive gene. αvβ <dig> receptors are considered to be potential therapeutic targets because of their anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects, and cilengitidem, which is known as αvβ <dig> antagonist, has been studied in anti-cancer therapy  <cit> . likewise, itgb <dig> could be a potential biomarker as a prognostic marker or radiosensitizer in radiotherapy. using systems biology, we showed that major cancer-related signaling pathways were enriched related to radiosensitivity  and that the integrin signaling pathway interacts with other pathways, including mapkwnt, and pi3k signaling, as shown in figure 3b. these findings suggest that integrin signaling with identified adhesion molecules could be central in radiosensitivity and one of the common radiosensitivity mechanisms, regardless of cell type. our work could be the basis for future biological validation targeting integrin signaling pathways in radiosensitization.

although we identified a common radiosensitivity signature regardless of cell type, radiosensitive cells  included cells of lymphoid origin and could have introduced bias in analysis. to exclude the effect of lymphoid origin, we adjusted correlation coefficients and p-values between radiosensitive cells  and radioresistant cells  using mean-centering and a standardization method  <cit>  . we observed that correlation coefficients of the  <dig> radiosensitivity signature genes were similar before and after adjustment for the four microarrays. therefore, we used the microarray data without artificial adjustment for cell type, which could change the true values of the experimental data.

there are two limitations to this study. first, we used nci- <dig> cancer cell lines to identify common radiosensitivity signatures regardless of cell type. defining common radiosensitive mechanisms not affected by cell type is helpful, but the actual cellular response in biological validation might differ among cell types. however, we adjusted for this effect using statistical methods. adjusted correlation coefficients were similar to correlation coefficients before adjustment. second, although we identified a gene signature using four microarray array platforms, using not only mrna expression, but also comparing dna sequences or protein expression would give a comprehensive analysis of the radiosensitivity mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
a common radiosensitivity gene signature was identified that involved  <dig> genes. their major functions were in the cell cycle, cell junctions, and cell adhesion. adhesion-related molecules were enriched in the integrin signaling pathway and could be targeted for radiosensitization. this is the first study to use multiple microarray platforms to study radiosensitivity, and might provide insights in elucidating novel therapeutic targets and common radiosensitivity mechanisms regardless of cell type.
