BACKGROUND
pathogenesis-related  proteins are part of the plant defense responses that are induced by pathogens as well as by abiotic stresses  <cit> . to date,  <dig> different families of pr proteins have been identified, based on their specific structural and functional properties . among the pr proteins, the pr <dig> family is composed of intracellular acidic proteins with molecular masses ranging from 15– <dig> kd and are encoded by multiple genes  <cit> . pr <dig> genes were first described in pisum sativum inoculated with fusarium solani  <cit>  but have been subsequently described in many species . in addition to their inducible expression in response to stresses, pr <dig> genes also exhibit constitutive high expressed levels in roots, flowers and pollen during normal growth and development, suggesting additional roles beyond pathogenesis responses  <cit> .

based on sequence similarities, pr <dig> proteins have been suggested to be ribonucleases   <cit> . indeed, pr <dig> proteins from a variety of species including two pea pr <dig> proteins have been demonstrated to possess rnase activity  <cit> . although rnase activities have been detected for many pr <dig> proteins, they have also been shown to interact with molecules such as cytokinins , brassinosteroids, fatty acids, and flavonoids  <cit> . these observations have led to the suggestion that all pr <dig> proteins may not be rnases and may be involved during normal plant growth and development as hormone/ligand carriers  <cit> . this suggestion is further supported by the fact that ck-specific binding proteins  exhibit amino acid sequence and predicted secondary-structure similarities with pr <dig> proteins and, for this reason, have been included in the pr <dig> family  <cit> .

the pea abscisic acid-responsive protein abr <dig>  induced by the exogenous application of abscisic acid  is classified as a member of the pr <dig> family in pea  <cit> . abr <dig> is produced late in seed development, and is homologous to dehydrins and late embryogenesis abundant -related proteins  <cit> . abr <dig> is also significantly homologous to intracellular pathogenesis related  proteins and major birch pollen allergen betv <dig> proteins  <cit> . our previous research has demonstrated the expression of abr <dig> protein in pea under salt stress  <cit>  and the rnase activity of two members of pea pr <dig> proteins   <cit> . furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of pea pr <dig>  and abr <dig> cdnas enhance germination and early seedling growth under abiotic stress conditions in b. napus and a. thaliana, respectively  <cit> . in addition, the transgenic plants also exhibited phenotypic differences when compared to their wt counterparts, which included precocious flowering, a higher number of lateral branches, and increased numbers of seed pods  <cit> . many of these characteristics of abr17-transgenic a. thaliana are suggestive of a role for cks in abr <dig> action, particularly increased lateral branching and early flowering  <cit> . our suggestion was further supported by the elevated concentrations of endogenous cks in pr <dig>  transgenic b. napus as well as abr17-transgenic a. thaliana  <cit> .

these observations led us to hypothesize that pr <dig> proteins, including abr <dig>  may mediate the observed phenotypic effects through modulation of endogenous cks. additional evidence supporting this hypothesis has been provided by the demonstration that exogenous application of ck enhances germination under abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . in order to further investigate the abr17-mediated changes in a. thaliana we investigated global changes in gene expression using microarrays. microarray analysis was carried out in an abr17-transgenic line compared to its wt, salt treated abr17-transgenic line compared to untreated abr17-transgenic line, and salt treated wt compared to untreated wt seedlings. our current findings reveal that, even in the absence of stress, the expression of genes involved in plant growth and development are significantly  increased in the transgenic line. salt treated abr17-transgenic a. thaliana seedlings showed general salt response theme comparable to that of the wt counterpart used in this study. however, both the trend as well as the degree of changes in gene expression of many defense related genes including plant defensins and heat shock proteins was different providing additional insights into the possible ways in which abr <dig> may mediate plant responses to stress.

RESULTS
characterization of abr17-transgenic plants/seedlings
the appearance of 2-week-old wt and abr17- transgenic a. thaliana seedlings grown in soil as well as on ms medium   <cit>  plates are shown in figure  <dig>  at all growth stages investigated, the abr17-transgenic line was considerably more developmentally advanced compared to its wt counterpart. for example, in the 5-day-old transgenic seedlings  cotyledons were more developed than in their wt counterparts and at 14-days the transgenic seedlings possessed more rosette leaves . similar developmental differences were also observed at  <dig> days where many transgenic seedlings had started to bolt whereas very few  wt seedlings had advanced to this developmental stage . at  <dig> days, the transgenic seedlings also possessed more lateral branches . the transgenic seedlings also flowered earlier than wt with an average difference of at least  <dig>  days . seedlings for microarray experiments were grown on semi-solid ms media in order to maintain sterility and it was evident that under these growth conditions also the transgenic seedlings were more developmentally advanced . these results are consistent with our previous observations of seedlings from this and other independently derived abr17-transgenic lines grown on semi solid ms media  <cit> . in addition, the abr17-transgenic seedlings grown on ms media with  <dig> mm nacl were greener and their roots appeared to be longer compared to the wt seedlings grown under similar conditions .

ns: non-significant

characteristics like root length, fresh weight, chlorophyll a/b content and carotenoid contents were measured in salt treated- abr <dig> and wt seedlings. roots of abr17-transgenic seedlings were relatively longer in the absence of salt whereas upon salt treatment, the differences in lengths were not that obvious . the fresh weight of abr17-transgenic seedlings was not significantly different from its wt counterpart in the absence of stress. however, in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl, the fresh weights of the transgenic seedlings were significantly  higher than their wt counterparts . although the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were almost similar in abr <dig> and wt seedlings without any stress, upon nacl treatment the transgenic seedlings had significantly  higher levels of chlorophyll . our results indicate that the nacl treatment had less deleterious effects on the abr17-transgenic seedlings compared to the wt.

in order to further characterize the differences between the wt and abr17-transgenic lines, the ability of both wt and abr17-transgenic seedlings to germinate in the presence or absence of light at rt was compared. in the dark, 85% of abr17-transgenic a. thaliana had germinated after one week, whereas only 10% of the wt seeds had germinated under the same conditions . in contrast, in the presence of light, 100% of both abr17-transgenic and wt seeds had germinated in the same period . most arabidopsis ecotypes require light for germination, which is primarily controlled by a reversible red light dependent equilibrium of the photoreceptors  <cit> . it is also known that exogenous cks can substitute for red light and enhance the germination of certain light-requiring species in the dark  <cit> . furthermore, a. thaliana detiolated  mutants exhibits many characteristics of seeds germinated in the presence of light even when germinated in dark  <cit> , a phenotype that has been attributed to cks because of the fact that even wt seedlings exhibit the same phenotype when germinated in the dark following exogenous ck application  <cit> . a role for cks can also be inferred from the observation that coumarin or far-red light, both of which prevent the formation of ck-nucleosides from storage forms of cks, inhibit germination of lettuce seeds in the dark  <cit> . interestingly, amp <dig> a. thaliana mutants, which possess higher endogenous cks, also exhibited a photomorphogenic response that in part similar to our abr17-transgenic seedlings  <cit> . taken together, all these results seem to suggest that endogenous cks play an important role in the germination of light-sensitive seeds and the elevated endogenous cks in abr17-transgenic seedlings previously reported  <cit>  may be responsible for the enhanced germination of this genotype in the dark .

transcriptional profiling using microarrays
in order to characterize the molecular changes brought about by the expression of pea abr <dig> cdna in a. thaliana that resulted in the observed phenotypes, we analyzed gene expression by profiling the transcripts of abr17-transgenic plants in the absence and presence of  <dig> mm nacl. as described earlier, the first set of microarray analysis was the investigation of the differences in gene expression between abr17-transgenic and wt a. thaliana in the absence of nacl . the second set of microarray analysis was between  <dig> mm nacl-treated wt and untreated wt a. thaliana . the third set of microarray analysis was between  <dig> mm nacl treated abr17-transgenic versus untreated abr17-transgenic a. thaliana .

microarrays  consisting of probes presenting  <dig>  unique genes identified by arabidopsis genome initiative  locus identifiers were used. we identified transcripts as those with mean signal intensities that differed significantly from  <dig> at α =  <dig>  in a student's t-test in each set of microarrays. the transcripts were categorized based on shared structural elements and/or inferred function. we selected  <dig> genes representing different functional categories, which according to our microarray analysis showed enhanced or reduced levels of transcript abundance to validate our microarrays. the results from microarrays and qrt-pcr analysis are discussed below.

first set of transcriptional profiling: genes responsive to abr17
of the significantly responsive transcripts due the expression of pea abr <dig> in a. thaliana,  <dig> were observed to be modulated in the transgenic line at least  <dig> -fold compared to wt with  <dig> increasing and  <dig> decreasing in transcript abundance . many of these genes had annotations that were associated with either defense or plant growth and development, or both. a total of  <dig> genes showed significant differences in transcript abundance about 2-fold, where  <dig> genes exhibited increased transcript abundance and  <dig> genes showed a decrease in transcript abundance .

all expression ratios are significant  and are in a log <dig> scale where fold change is abr17/wt.

among the highly induced transcripts in transgenic seedlings that were putatively related to defense responses , we detected  <dig> members of the plant defensin  family which exhibited an increased in abundance ~2–3-fold in the transgenic line. pdfs are small , highly basic cysteine-rich peptides belonging to the large defensin family, and are present throughout the plant kingdom. these proteins are known for their involvement in ancestral non-specific innate immune defense system  <cit> . in addition to being involved in mediating plant responses to pathogens, defensins may also play an important role in plant growth and development. for example, the constitutive expression of atpep <dig> induced the expression of pdf <dig>  which resulted in better root development in a. thaliana suggesting that plant defensins may regulate root development  <cit> .

another interesting transcript that exhibited increased abundance  in abr17-transgenic plants was a putative mitogen-activated protein kinase . mapk cascades are known to play crucial roles in physiological processes such as cell growth, cell cycle regulation and developmental control as well as plant defense signaling  <cit> . they are also known to activate wrky type transcription factors that are involved in transcriptional activation of disease resistance genes  <cit> . indeed, we have observed a modest, but elevated expression of four genes belonging to the wrky family and disease resistance protein .

we also observed increased transcript abundance for several genes involved in plant growth and development . for example, expansins were detected as highly induced transcripts in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana . expansins are cell wall proteins that are known to induce ph-dependent plant cell wall extension and stress relaxation  <cit> . the expansins have been related to cell differentiation in tissues such as xylem, leaf primordia and root hairs  <cit> . previous studies on transgenic plants expressing expansin genes have demonstrated precocious leaf development, longer petioles and larger leaf blades  <cit> .

glycine-rich proteins  were also detected among growth related genes that whose transcripts increased in abundance in abr17-transgenic plants . grps consist of quasi-repetitive glycine-rich domains, most commonly gggx, ggxxxgg or gxgx repeats  <cit> . some grps have been reported as structural components of the plant cell walls based on their co-localization with cell wall  <cit> . grps have also been reported to be activated by osmotic stress  <cit> , cold shock  <cit>  and wounding  <cit> .

the genes that exhibited significant enhanced expression in abr17-transgenic plants also included genes for proline-rich protein  family, xyloglucon endotransglycosylase , glycosyl hydrolase , phytosulfokine precursor  <dig> , no apical meristem  protein family and glutaredoxins . prps represent a family of structural cell wall proteins that have been implicated in various plant developmental processes  <cit> . similarly, xth and gh family genes are involved in structuring xyloglucan cross-links in plant cell wall and plant development . the psk <dig> gene is also involved in cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . similarly, the nam gene product is required for shoot apical meristem  formation during embryogenesis as well as for normal flower development  <cit> . glutaredoxins have also been demonstrated to be involved in flower development, probably by mediating post-translational modifications of target proteins required for normal petal organ initiation and morphogenesis  <cit> . our current observations that the significantly  higher expression of the above mentioned genes related to growth and development including flowering correlates well with the observed phenotypes which include early flowering, increased lateral branching and seed pods as observed in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana .

a role for cytokinins in abr17-induced changes in gene expression?
interestingly, members of most of the gene families described above  that are involved in plant defense as well as growth and development, have been previously reported to be regulated by cks. for example, genome-wide expression profiling of immediate-early and delayed ck- response genes of a. thaliana, has led to the identification of many genes that are up- regulated by cks including members of expansin , grps , nam , f-box protein , erbfs, putative ring zinc finger protein , a member of the bhlh family , blue copper binding protein  and psk <dig>  <cit> . the blue copper binding protein  and putative ring zinc finger protein  identified by brenner et al.   <cit>  as ck-induced were observed to be up-regulated in our microarrays analysis. similarly, gene expression analysis of transgenic a. thaliana seedlings transformed with bacterial isopentenyl transferase   <cit>  gene revealed increased transcript abundance for many members of mapk and wrky gene families, which included the specific wrky gene – at1g <dig> that has been detected in our microarray studies as being induced by abr <dig> expression . another investigation into ck action in arabidopsis has demonstrated increased expression of genes for cytochrome p <dig>  pdf, expansin, patatin, wrky members and putative disease resistance protein in response to cks  <cit> . therefore, it is apparent that several genes whose transcript levels were modulated by abr <dig> expression in a. thaliana have been previously reported in the literature as being ck-responsive, there by suggesting an important role for ck-mediated gene expression in abr <dig> action in planta.

second set of transcriptional profiling: genes responsive to salt stress in wt a. thaliana
microarray- based analyses of the salt responses in arabidopsis have been published in several reports. however, most of these studies have investigated responses to very short-term exposure to salt. in this study, we report the transcriptional changes in a. thaliana as a result of long-term, continuous exposure to  <dig> mm nacl. here, we allowed a. thaliana seeds to germinate and grow on semi-solid medium in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> weeks, and the rna extracted from whole seedlings were used for cdna synthesis and subsequent microarray analysis. the results from microarray analysis of salt treated wt arabidopsis seedlings  agreed with previous studies using similar approaches  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes that showed more than four fold changes in transcript abundance which have been previously reported as being responsive to salt. our results, therefore, indicate that both short-term "shock" treatments with nacl as well as long-term treatment used in this study elicit similar responses in a. thaliana at the transcript level .

members of protease inhibitor/lipid transfer protein  family were seen among highly up regulated and/or down regulated genes. at least five members showed increase in transcript abundance and  <dig> member showed decrease in transcript abundance of more than  <dig> fold . ltp genes contain aba-responsive  element  and are induced by abscisic acid   <cit> . it has been reported in the literature that nacl, mannitol or aba treatments induce the expression of a gene encoding an ltp-like protein in tomato  <cit> . in addition, the changes in the expression of ltp genes during salt stress have been previously reported  <cit> . although, most of the ltp genes were up regulated after short term treatment with salt, they were found to be down regulated after  <dig> h of salt treatment  <cit> . from our studies, it appears that many of the ltp genes will get up regulated in response to long term stress as a result of expected increase in aba levels.

other major groups of genes with increase in transcript abundance following nacl treatment included two members of glycosyltransferases  and five members of glycoside hydrolases . gts and ghs are major families of carbohydrate-active that play a primary role in structuring xyloglucan cross-links in plant cell wall  <cit> . they have been previously reported to be induced by salinity stress in plants and this has been implicated in drought and salt tolerance in a. thaliana  <cit> . other genes exhibiting increased transcript abundance included ribonuclease rns <dig>  osmotin-like protein, hydroxycinnamoyl benzoyltransferase-related, oxidoreductase, 2og-fe oxygenase family, glutathione transferase and zinc finger  protein family . similarly, the genes which showed decrease in transcript abundance more than  <dig> fold included many photosynthetic genes, plant defensins, heat shock proteins, auxin-induced proteins, disease resistance protein, bet v i allergen family and bhlh protein. these results are once again consistent with the previously reported results from microarray-based investigation into salinity stress responses  <cit> .

third set of transcriptional profiling: genes responsive to salt stress in presence of abr17
the results from microarray analysis of salt treated abr <dig> transgenic a. thaliana seedlings are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we identified  <dig> genes showing either increase or decrease in transcript abundance more than 4-fold, which included transcription factors , stress responsive genes , carbohydrate and cell wall metabolism , electron transport and oxidoreductases , lipid metabolism , protein and amino acid metabolism , proteins involved in transport across membranes  and  <dig> unknown or unclassified genes.

transcriptional factors are necessary for the proper transcriptional regulation in response environmental cues  <cit>  and those exhibiting significant increases in transcript abundance included bhlh,  <dig> members of ap <dig> related,  <dig> members of nam, zinc finger  protein family, atmyb <dig> , athb- <dig> , and wrky families. bhlh <dig> has been indicated among the highly induced transcripts in response to nacl treatment in the previous transcriptomic studies and are suggested to be important regulators of the nacl-stress response in arabidopsis  <cit> . the apetala <dig>  domain defines a large family of transcription factors which play important roles in plant growth, development as well as stress tolerance  <cit> .

similarly, as previously stated, nam genes have been found to be induced by abiotic stresses implying roles in stress responses in addition to those in plant growth and development  <cit> . nam/nac proteins belong contain highly conserved nac  domains in their n-terminal regions, that specifically binds target dna  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that nac transcription factors are aba-responsive  <cit>  and are also induced by other plant hormones like naa and ethylene  <cit> . overexpression of nac genes has been shown to result in an increase in lateral roots, and tolerance to abiotic stresses like drought and salt stress. nac genes are believed to exert their stress ameliorating activity through the regulation of stress-inducible genes  <cit> . similarly, the wrky family tf genes and myb family genes are known to be biotic and/or abiotic stress responsive  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the increased tolerance of abr17-transgenic seedlings to nacl is the combined effect of the modulation of the levels of abundance of transcripts for these transcription factors with demonstrated roles in stress tolerance.

the highest transcript abundance of any gene observed in salt treated abr <dig> plants was xtr- <dig>  which showed  <dig> -fold increase, compared to the untreated abr17-transgenic line. xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase  has been suggested to be a key enzyme involved in the modification of the xyloglucan cross-links that controls the strength and extensibility of the plant cell wall  <cit> . three members of gh family were also seen among genes which up regulated more than 4-fold change . the importance of ghs genes in plant stress  <cit>  has already been discussed in the previous section.

others salt responsive genes in the abr17-transgenic line included osmotin, mannitol dehydrogenase, steroid sulfotransferases and rd <dig>  which are known to be regulated by aba, are expressed in salt-stressed plants and have been used to engineer salinity tolerance  <cit> . in addition, we also observed increase in transcript abundance for ribonuclease- rns <dig>  peroxidases, copper/zinc superoxidase dismutase , cytochrome p <dig> family, mate efflux protein and protein kinases which have been previously demonstrated to accumulate in salt treated tissues by others  <cit> . from our microarray results, it appears that many genes involved in mediating responses to salinity stress are increased in transcript abundance as would be expected.

comparison of salt responses in wt and abr <dig> transgenic seedlings
although transcriptional changes were almost similar both in salt treated- abr <dig> and wt seedlings, the transcript abundance of some genes exhibited significant differences in both the trend as well as the degree of modulation of transcript abundance . for instance, as mentioned previously, transcript abundance of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase   increased  <dig> -fold in salt treated abr <dig> seedlings, whereas it showed only a  <dig> -fold increase in salt-treated wt seedlings . similarly, ap <dig> domain related transcription factor rap <dig>   increased  <dig> -fold in salt treated abr <dig> compared to  <dig> -fold in treated wt plants. the expressed proteins- aba-responsive protein-related  and unknown protein  also showed increase in transcript abundance of at least 4-fold in salt-treated abr <dig> transgenic line compared to the 2-fold increase observed for the wt in response to salt. other genes which exhibited increase in transcript abundance of more than  <dig> fold in salt-treated abr <dig> transgenic but showed less abundance in treated wt included pathogenesis-related protein,  and glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase . on the other hand, the retroelement pol polyprotein  with unknown function showed a down regulation of more than 2-fold in salt-treated transgenic abr <dig> line, but was up regulated in salt treated wt arabidopsis plants.

footnote: all expression ratios are significant  and in a log <dig> scale where fold change is salt treated abr17/control abr <dig> and salt treated wt/control wt.

interestingly, many members of heat shock protein  family and pdf family showed the opposite response in salt-treated abr17-transgenic seedlings compared to the salt-treated wt counterparts, with an increase of transcript abundance in salt-treated abr17-transgenic . this difference in the direction of the response in gene expression i.e. induction in the transgenic seedlings versus the repression in the wt may have important consequences with respect to the ability to tolerate salinity  stress. for example, the hsp family contains chaperones, which have important roles in protein folding, assembly and in the disposal of unwanted nonfunctional proteins. hsps are usually induced by environmental stress, and the accumulation of hsps coincides with enhanced stress tolerance  <cit> . in addition, transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing athsp <dig>  accumulate high levels of athsp <dig>  protein and show enhanced tolerance to drought and salinity  <cit> . the abundance of hsps in plants and their functional characteristics suggest that hsps play an important role in plant stress tolerance. thus, the increased abundance of hsp transcripts in the abr17-transgenic seedlings may be important for the increased tolerance of this line to the imposed stress.

the up regulation of pdfs in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana grown under normal conditions  and their importance in growth and development has already been discussed earlier. the literature also supports a role for pdfs in stress tolerance  <cit> . most of the previously characterized pdfs exhibit anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti- insect and protease inhibitor activity  <cit> . however, the halophyte salt cress , a relative of arabidopsis over expresses pdfs under normal conditions and hence defensins are believed to play a role in salt tolerance  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the observed relatively tolerant phenotype of abr17-transgenic seedlings could be due, at least in part, to the elevated expression of xtr <dig>  rap <dig>  transcription factors, unknown proteins , hsp and pdf gene. additional studies are underway in our laboratory to precisely characterize the role of the above-mentioned genes in stress tolerance of abr17- transgenic a. thaliana seedlings.

qrt-pcr validation of microarray observations
in order to confirm the fact that ck-responsive genes were indeed up-regulated in the abr17-transgenic lines, we performed qrt-pcr experiments with the following genes: plant defensin protein , expansin , grp  and putative mapk  <dig>  using qrt-pcr. among the ck- inducible genes identified from our first set of microarray experiments we chose the above  <dig> genes for qrt-pcr as their transcripts were observed to be at least ~2-fold  or higher in the transgenic line compared to wt. our microarray analysis revealed increase in transcripts for defensin, expansin, grp and mapk in pea abr <dig> seedlings by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively . our qrt-pcr results were consistent with the microarray data and showed up-regulation of defensin, expansin, grp and mapk by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -folds, respectively . from these results it is apparent that all the four genes that were up-regulated in our microarray analysis also demonstrated up- regulation in the qrt-pcr relative expression experiments .

because of the fact that the specific members of gene families whose transcripts were detected to be modulated by abr <dig> cdna expression in a. thaliana were not exactly identical to those specific members of these families identified by other studies, we wanted to investigate whether those specific members detected in our studies were indeed ck-inducible/repressible. in these experiments, we used wt a. thaliana tissue germinated and grown for 14-days medium supplemented with  <dig> μm zeatin for additional qrt-pcr experiments. this concentration of zeatin was chosen based on our earlier observations that it induced the largest phenotypic responses in a. thaliana when exogenously applied  <cit> . it must also be noted that even though  <dig> μm zeatin was used in our experiments, it is difficult to estimate how much of this exogenously supplied ck actually gets into the seed in order to exert a physiological effect. from the results shown in figure  <dig>  it is apparent that the expression of expl <dig> , putative mapk  and grp  was up-regulated in response to exogenous zeatin by  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 2-fold, respectively . in contrast, the expression of defensin gene was observed to be down-regulated  in response to the exogenous application of ck . the results for expansin, mapk and grp are consistent with our microarray and qrt-pcr results with respect to increased transcript abundance in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana previously shown to possess higher endogenous ck concentrations  <cit> . however, in the case of defensin, even though our microarray and qrt-pcr experiments revealed that this gene was up-regulated in the abr17-transgenic line , its expression was not induced by exogenous ck . the reason for this discrepancy is not immediately clear; however, this may be due to the concentration as well as type of ck used for our exogenous experiments. furthermore, as indicated previously, the amount of the exogenously supplied ck entering the seed to exert physiological affect may also be different from the concentrations required to elicit induction of this gene.

in order to confirm results from our second and third set of microarray analysis, we performed qrt-pcr experiments with the following  <dig> genes: unknown proteins , xtr <dig> , bhlh , ap <dig> domain transcription factor rap  <dig>  , atnac <dig> , acd <dig> , pdf <dig> a , expl <dig> , grp  and mapk  <dig> . the unknown proteins were chosen because expression of two of them  were among highly induced transcripts in salt treated abr17-trangenic line and also showed comparatively less but high level of transcript abundance in salt treated wt a. thaliana lines . two of them  were among highly down regulated genes in both salt treated abr17-transgenic line and wt a. thaliana lines . our qrt-pcr data showed similar trend as observed by microarrays for all the above-mentioned genes in both salt-treated abr17-transgenic and salt-treated wt microarrays .

the genes at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig> showed transcript abundance with fold changes of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively in our microarray analysis of salt treated wt a. thaliana . our qrt-pcr analysis of salt treated wt a. thaliana showed transcript abundance of and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold for genes at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig>  compared to qrt-pcr indicated transcript abundance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold for genes at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig>  respectively . our qrt-pcr analysis of salt treated abr <dig> a. thaliana showed transcript abundance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold for genes at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig>  respectively . from these results, it is apparent that all the four genes showed the same trend both in our microarray analysis and qrt-pcr studies  although the absolute values were different with these two experimental methods.

the gene xtr <dig>  was selected because it was among one of the most highly induced transcripts of any gene on our salt treated abr17-transgenic a. thalina microarray . the genes bhlh , rap  <dig>   and atnac <dig>  were chosen because their expression was the highest among any other transcription factors identified in response to salt in abr17- transgenic line . the genes at4g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at3g <dig> showed transcript abundance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively in microarray analysis of salt treated wt a. thaliana, while our qrt-pcr analysis of salt treated wt a. thaliana showed transcript abundance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> - fold . similarly, microarray analysis of salt treated abr <dig> a. thaliana showed transcript abundance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   and our qrt-pcr analysis values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> - fold for genes at4g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at3g <dig>  respectively . our microarray analysis and qrt-pcr results showed the similar trend in both salt treated-abr <dig> and wt samples , the genes pdf <dig> a, expl <dig>  grp, and mapk  <dig> were chosen as these were validated in our first set of microarrays . once again, a similar trend was observed between microarrays and qrt-pcr analysis thus validating our microarray results.

relative expression of ck-biosynthetic genes  in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana
as discussed earlier, our observations indicated that many of the genes identified in the transgenic plants as being up-regulated are from families that contain ck-responsive members. we have also previously reported higher endogenous concentrations of ck in this line  <cit> , which suggested the possibility that this may be due to either enhanced de novo ck biosynthesis or decreased degradation. specifically, the endogenous concentration of total ck in the transgenic line used in this study was ~1–3-fold higher, with the concentration of zeatin  being ~ <dig> -fold and ip being ~2-fold higher in these transgenic lines. however, we did not detect any ipt  or ckx  genes as being significantly up- or down-regulated genes in our microarray experiments suggesting that the elevated endogenous ck concentrations previously reported may not be the result of increased or decreased activities of ipt and ckx genes, respectively. in order to confirm our microarray results and to lend additional support to our above- mentioned hypothesis with respect to the roles  of ipt and ckx expression in abr17-transgenic a. thaliana, we also performed qrt-pcr analysis of the expression of ipt and ckx genes using qrt-pcr. there are  <dig> known ipt genes and  <dig> known ckx genes but sequence of ckx <dig> and  <dig> are very similar therefore we performed qrt-pcr analysis on the  <dig> ipt and  <dig> ckx genes. the results from these experiments are summarized in table  <dig> and it is apparent that most of the ipt genes exhibit similar expression patterns in both transgenic and wt seedlings. the only exception appears to be ipt  <dig> where only  <dig> -fold expression of this gene was observed in the transgenic line . similarly, ckx expression in the transgenic line was also quite similar to its expression in the wt . our results suggest that the differences in endogenous ck concentrations previously observed in the abr17-transgenic line may not be the result of increased ipt or decreased ckx levels. however, frequently, there is no correlation between transcript abundance and protein levels and therefore it is possible that ipt and/or ckx protein concentrations may have been affected in the transgenic line resulting in increased endogenous cks as a result of post-translational processes. however, our previously reported proteome studies on this transgenic line did not reveal any differences between transgenic and wt seedlings with respect to the levels of these proteins  <cit> .

*the expression of each gene in wt was normalized to  <dig> and fold change in transgenic line was calculated as described in methods

it is possible that the activity of neither ipt nor ckx is responsible for the increased endogenous concentrations of cks in the abr17-transgenic lines and the increased endogenous cks previously reported in the abr17-transgenic lines may be the result of trna degradation by the previously demonstrated rnase activity of pea abr <dig> protein  <cit> . thus, an increase in free cellular ck would not necessarily involve enhanced ipt or reduced ckx activity; rather it may reflect an increased access to existing, yet trna-bound, ck.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that pea abr <dig> cdna expression modulates the level of a number of transcripts related to plant defense, growth and development, which may explain the observed phenotypic differences between wt and abr17-transgenic a. thaliana. the gene expression of many transcription factors and defense responsive genes like hsps and pdfs showed different degree and kind of response between salt treated-abr <dig> transgenic and wt a. thaliana, which explains the observed enhanced germination and early seedling vigor in abr <dig> transgenic lines, compared to its wt counterpart. many of the genes exhibiting a 2-fold or higher increase in transcript abundance are known ck-responsive genes providing additional evidence of a role for cks in abr <dig> function. furthermore, a detailed expression analysis of ipts and ckxs revealed that the levels of these transcripts were similar in both wt and transgenic seedlings, suggesting the possibility that abr <dig> modulates endogenous cks through an, as of yet, uncharacterized mechanism including the possible degradation of trnas which contain ck moieties  <cit> . these possibilities are currently being investigated in our laboratory.
