BACKGROUND
northern australia has the ideal conditions for the establishment of the japanese encephalitis virus , given its dual abundance of both culex annulirostris skuse – a vector identified as transmitting jev in the region  <cit>  – and the feral pig populations that act as principal amplifying hosts for the virus's transmission to humans  <cit> . over the last decade jev has become endemic in papua new guinea , and now cycles yearly on islands in the torres strait  <dig> km from mainland australia . it has appeared twice on australia's cape york since  <dig>  but in each case the virus did not establish  <cit> .

given these conditions, the failure of jev to establish itself on the australian continent over the past decade has perplexed researchers. suggested explanations for this have included the presence of alternative blood-meal hosts and competition with antigenically related arboviruses for susceptible vertebrate hosts  <cit> . but another possibility is that unrecognized species or population variation of this vector throughout southern png and northern australia itself may limit the establishment of jev. are there differences between the cx. annulirostris populations that exist where jev occurs in png and the torres strait, and in mainland australia that work to contain rather than spread jev throughout this region? as this first unravelling of the genetic diversity of this species and its closely related sister species suggests, population variation around the southern limit of jev may in fact restrict the movement of an arbovirus.

although mosquitoes are the vectors of pathogens that cause significant human disease, their genetic diversity remains poorly understood. in our region of australasia  the closely related mosquito species cx. annulirostris, cx. palpalis taylor and the coastally restricted cx. sitiens wiedemann are abundant with distributions in australia, papua new guinea  and the solomon islands  <cit> . the morphospecies cx. annulirostris transmits exotic jev and is also australia's principal vector of endemic arboviruses that cause human disease, including ross river virus, barmah forest virus, murray valley encephalitis virus and kunjin virus   <cit> ]. the potential establishment of jev in northern australia is of serious concern to public health officials in australia  <cit> , as this virus, which was restricted to southeast asia, is responsible for an estimated  <dig> – <dig>  cases there annually  <cit> . yet despite regular jev activity in the torres strait and seroconversions of sentinel animals in  <dig> and  <dig> on australia's cape york, there is no evidence that jev has become enzootic on the australian mainland  <cit> .

overlapping morphology exists between these culex taxa and allozyme and pcr-based procedures, previously developed to separate these mosquitoes, have suggested the presence of cryptic species within these morphospecies  <cit> . in this study we have sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit i gene  to look at the genetic structure, evolution and distribution of cx. annulirostis, cx. palpalis and cx. sitiens collected in australasia. we evaluate this dna barcoding marker in a phylogenetic framework to examine the genetic diversity of three culex morphospecies, one of which is the most important arbovirus vector in australasia.

we present sequence data generated from  <dig> mosquitoes that support the distinction of the three morphospecies, as well as the recognition of multiple divergent lineages. the phylogeographic pattern is most complex in cx. annulirostris with two distinct paraphyletic lineages recognized within australia – both independently related to the png lineages. this data provides phylogenetic support for a recent historical connection of mosquito populations in australia and png that will facilitate more rational arbovirus competency experiments and better surveillance for these mosquitoes in the future. importantly, the southern limit of the two png cx. annulirostris lineages equates exactly to the current southern limit of jev activity in the australasian region.

RESULTS
mosquito identification: morphology versus rdna its <dig> and coi
there was 10% incongruity between the its <dig> diagnostic results and the morphology of  <dig> field collected adults . for cx. annulirostris, correct morphological identification occurred  <dig> % of the time ,  <dig> % for cx. sitiens  and  <dig> % for cx. palpalis . these results confirm the difficulty distinguishing cx. palpalis from cx. annulirostris and highlight the fact that cx. palpalis is probably underrepresented in studies that use morphology only for species discrimination.

of  <dig> different coi haplotypes found in  <dig> field-collected mosquitoes – comprising  <dig> cx. sitiens,  <dig> cx. annulirostris and  <dig> cx. palpalis – there was 100% agreement between the its <dig> diagnostic and the coi sequence grouping of culex spp. the final sequence alignment  was  <dig> nucleotides of which 77%  were constant, 19%  were parsimony informative and the remaining 4%  represented unique singletons. the majority  of the parsimony informative sites were detected at the 3rd codon position, compared with 11% at the 1st codon position and none in the 2nd position. a pronounced at-bias was observed at the 3rd codon position and when the three codons were examined separately, differences in nucleotide compositions were observed. for example, at the first codon position, guanine was represented  <dig> % of the time, compared to  <dig> % in the second codon position and  <dig> % in the third codon position, suggesting that significant differences in the model of sequence evolution between three codon positions are required. to counterbalance the effect of discrepancy between codon position and nucleotide diversity, a gtr model  was selected in agreement with modeltest  <dig>   <cit>  for the maximum likelihood analyses. the complex model of substitution including gamma distribution and invariant sites  was selected for the full alignment by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test  as well as the akaike information criterion . moreover, the dataset for the bayesian analysis was separated into partitions corresponding to first, second and third codon positions, thus allowing application of independent parameters for these partitions in order to better fit the model to the dataset.

the translation of the nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence, using the invertebrate genetic code, showed identical amino acid sequences for all considered haplotypes in the three species, except for a single amino acid valine substituted to leucine in haplotype a <dig>  of cx. annulirostris collected in png. both valine and leucine are similar in their chemical properties, being non-charged and hydrophobic. this mutation has been verified using three independent pcr amplifications and direct bidirectional sequencing.

both the maximum likelihood and bayesian methods show that the coi was able to discriminate the three taxa and confirmed all its <dig> identifications as well as several divergent lineages within cx. annulirostris and cx. palpalis . both phylogenetic methods produced the same tree with maximum likelihood showing lower branch support.

culex sitiens was the most divergent taxon, showing little geographic structure; the same haplotypes  occurred on both the east and west coasts of australia. the haplotypes  from png do form a clade within the australian grouping , but as only  <dig> individuals were assessed little can be interpreted from this.

both phylogenetic methods support the division of cx. palpalis into three divergent lineages  that show no geographic overlap . the pal-png lineage was restricted to png and the torres strait; the pal-n-aus lineage was restricted to northern australia; and the pal-s-aus was found only in southern australia.

culex annulirostris comprised four distinct lineages  with a fifth sublineage identified within the ann-aus lineage  in figures  <dig> and  <dig> due partly to the restricted distribution of this clade, which is the same as ann-png <dig>  these lineages showed clear geographic structure . the ann-aus lineage exists throughout australia and southern png while the ann-s-aus lineage appears to be more abundant in southern australia making up 92%  of collections in south australia  and also appearing sporadically along the east coast of australia . the png lineages ann-png <dig> and ann-png <dig> accounted for 76% of cx. annulirostris in png  with the torres strait and the top of queensland's cape york peninsula representing their southern limit . a fifth lineage ann-si occurred only in the solomon islands .

haplotype diversity was very high in all lineages with most lineages showing values above  <dig>  . apart from the major lineages described above and the sublineage ann-png <dig>  no phylogeographic structure was found among the remaining haplotypes.

genetic relationships within and between identified coi lineages
to evaluate the effectiveness of the barcoding methodology for identifying species biodiversity, we assessed the inter- and intraspecies divergence before and after the split of cx. annulirostis and cx. palpalis into their eight different lineages. for each population  we compared their minimum distance to a congener with the maximum divergence within each population . a threshold value of 3% was used to separate the graph into four quadrants representing the different categories of species  <cit> . the top right quadrant represents a high intra- and interspecific diversity suggesting that cryptic species are present, and the top left quadrant indicates high interspecific and low intraspecific diversity suggesting no cryptic species. the morphospecies cx. annulirostris and cx. palpalis appear in the top right quadrant , indicating high levels of genetic diversity within and between species and suggesting these as candidates for a taxonomic split  <cit> . the presence of cx. sitiens in the top left quadrant of figure 3a indicates that it did not display sufficient within-species variation to generate doubt as to whether it was a single biological entity. when the five lineages of cx. annulirostris and the three lineages of cx. palpalis, identified through phylogenetic inference, were reanalyzed, all eight lineages appeared in the bottom left quadrant , suggesting recently diverged populations and/or newly emerged species  <cit> .

alternative tree topologies
maximum likelihood methods were used to further characterize the phylogenetic relationship by testing alternative  trees. we used three haplotype subsets and inferred constrained trees using the au-test and the sh-test  <cit>  to test if the constrained trees were significantly better than our best unconstrained tree . first we constructed and bootstrapped an unconstrained tree using two alternative heuristic searching algorithms; this found trees showing identical topology with marginal differences in branch support . the relationship of the three cx. palpalis lineages was not fully resolved in the unconstrained tree and so we tested whether an alternative branching of these three lineages of cx. palpalis would be rejected if compared to the unconstrained topology supporting the following: . the au-test and sh-test could not reject the alternative topologies , indicating a trichotomy of the three lineages due to the lack of a robust phylogenetic signal.

approximately unbiased  and shimodaira-hasegawa  tests performed using consel  <dig> h. obs. – test statistics; * p-value <  <dig> , suggests that the constraints are significantly different – rejected; pal† – pal png, pal n-aus, pal s-aus; ann¶ – ann s-aus, ann png- <dig>  ann png- <dig>  ann aus. abbreviations: ann – culex annulirostris, pal – culex palpalis; for lineage description refer to figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

next we tested if we could reject the monophyly of the australian lineages of cx. annulirostris ann-aus and ann-s-aus as these two lineages appeared to be polyphyletic on the unconstrained tree . the au-test and sh-test rejected this constraint in subset  <dig> and  <dig> , and thus supported the separate evolutionary origin of the two australian cx. annulirostris lineages. in subset  <dig>  this topology was not rejected although the p-values for both tests were low. similarly, the monophyly of the cx. annulirostris lineage ann-png <dig> with ann-png <dig> in png was rejected by both tests in all three subsets .

the cx. annulirostris lineage ann-si from the solomon islands proved problematic as its placement on the phylogenetic tree was ambiguous . neither the au-test nor the sh-test could reject the alternative placing of ann-si:  as a sister to the rest of cx. annulirostris with cx. palpalis ;  as a sister to the rest of cx. palpalis only ; or  as a sister to the rest of cx. annulirostris only . hence, the evolutionary origin for the ann-si lineage is unresolved.

discussion
culex annulirostris and cx. palpalis have overlapping morphology and are made up of several distinct coi lineages whose major groupings are congruent with the its <dig> diagnostic developed to separate these cryptic species  <cit> . culex sitiens was most divergent and showed little genetic or geographic structure throughout our collection sites in australia, png and timor leste. its use of salt and brackish water larval habitats has allowed for the rapid exploitation of uniform coastal habitats throughout an extensive distribution that spans from asia to australia  <cit> .

culex palpalis comprises three geographically structured coi lineages. the branch to the pal-s-aus lineage from southern australia  is well supported. the pal-png and pal-n-aus lineages are supported biologically in that they appear restricted to southwest png and the torres strait  and to northern australia . the larval habitats of this mosquito are fresh-water sites with relatively low levels of organic matter  <cit> .

the four major lineages of cx. annulirostris indicate extended allopatric isolation, while the sublineage ann-png <dig> is a more recent event. the ann-si lineage includes specimens from the north and south solomon islands and probably represents a separate pacific island species. the ann-s-aus lineage is more common throughout southern australia and is found in much lower relative numbers along eastern australia and in torres strait; no ann-s-aus individuals were identified from the northern territory or western australia. the australian lineage  is the largest and most widespread, found throughout australia and extending well into png with one haplotype found in timor leste . there is increasing evidence that ann-aus may not have the intrinsic or extrinsic ability to be an effective jev vector. blood-meal studies from cx. annulirostris mosquitoes collected in northern queensland and cape york, that would represent ann-aus, indicate a feeding preference for marsupials, thus diverting host-seeking mosquitoes away from pigs and decreasing this lineage's efficiency as jev vector  <cit> . additionally, jev vector competency studies suggest that ann-aus may be a relatively inefficient laboratory vector for the jev genotype i strain which has been present in the torres strait and northern queensland since  <dig> . the ann-png <dig> and ann-png <dig> lineages exist in png and the torres strait, and though the monophyly of these two lineages is rejected, they both show a southern limit at the top of australia's cape york peninsula , which correlates exactly with the current southern limit of jev activity  <cit> .

in light of this coi diversity it is not surprising that cx. annulirostris is found in a wide variety of larval habitats including fresh and slightly brackish water, and in habitats with relatively high levels of organic matter as well as transient habitats  <cit> . if these divergent lineages represent separate biological species, it is unlikely that morphology will distinguish these taxa and another dna-based diagnostic tool will be required to study these mosquitoes.

mosquito phylogeography in australasia
the geological events of the miocene, pliocene and pleistocene are believed to be responsible for considerable speciation events in this region  <cit> . there were probably two dispersal opportunities for culicid fauna to move east into the australian region. the first was during the early pliocene  when the indo-malayan archipelago was in place and an easterly spread of oriental fauna was possible. the second was during the pleistocene glaciation periods , when vast areas of the sunda shelf  and sahul shelf  were exposed, facilitating the movement of fauna down the indo-malayan archipelago  <cit> . present coastlines of new guinea and northern australia were formed approximately  <dig> - <dig>  years ago and the land bridge between australia, the torres strait and new guinea was last flooded  <dig> - <dig>  years ago  <cit> .

we suggest two different biogeographic histories for these culex taxa. culex annulirostris and cx. palpalis have distributions limited mostly to australasia, with genetic and geographic structure suggestive of an extended evolutionary history in this region allowing the evolution of multiple divergent lineages. thus cx. annulirostris, cx. palpalis or an ancestor thereof appeared during the early pliocene , which would have permitted the necessary evolutionary time for geographic expansion and the development of divergent lineages. since cx. sitiens displays little genetic or geographic structure in australia and has a distribution spanning australasia and southeast asia to as far north as india  <cit> , we suggest a more recent expansion into australasia, probably during one of the more recent pleistocene glaciations .

barcoding closely related culex taxa
the mtdna coi sequence has been assessed as a marker for evaluating mosquito diversity and has proved useful in dna barcoding studies of mosquitoes across several genera and species identified through conventional morphological taxonomy  <cit> . in insect molecular systematics, other markers have been used with success: 18s rdna, 28s rdna, nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> and cytochrome oxidase ii  <cit> . here we have used the coi marker on closely related culex mosquito taxa that were genetically identified to species using the its <dig>  <cit> . we employed a maximum likelihood framework for hypothesis testing  <cit>  that provided insights into the evolutionary history of these three taxa. as both its <dig> markers and coi concurred with the latter, revealing several more divergent lineages within these taxa, we advocate that coi is a reasonable starting point for molecular identification of potential cryptic mosquito species of the genus culex.

CONCLUSIONS
the different geographic distributions of these distinct lineages suggest biological variety and thus it is reasonable to assume that many of these lineages will have different abilities to transmit endemic and exotic arboviruses. the coincidental southern limit of ann-png <dig>  ann-png <dig> and jev activity presents a plausible hypothesis as to why jev has not established on the australian mainland, despite the apparent abundance of local cx. annulirostris vectors and feral pig amplifying hosts  <cit> . as stressed above, the endemic ann-aus lineage may not be an effective jev vector due to its local marsupial feeding preferences and relative inefficiency in transmitting the jev genotype i strain and thus may provide northern australia with a natural buffer zone  <cit> . if either ann-png <dig> or ann-png <dig> is responsible for this jev activity it is important to determine their species status and monitor their distributions to determine if they are moving south into australia. if these lineages are not separate species then there is the possibility for gene flow from the png lineages to the ann-aus lineage on the australian mainland, and this may enhance the jev potential of local ann-aus populations. analysis of the vector competency of individual lineages is now required to characterize their intrinsic ability to transmit jev, while nuclear dna studies on sympatric populations would establish if natural mating barriers exist.

the question must now be asked as to whether ann-png <dig> and ann-png <dig> are exotic taxa naturally expanding their range from southwest png into australia – or are we observing the effects of climate change, such as have been suggested for the spread of the bluetounge arbovirus through europe alongside the northward movement of its culicoides vectors  <cit> . in australia, rapid shifts of latitude clines in drosophila over the last  <dig> years have provided evidence for biological changes through regional warming in queensland  <cit> , and this may also facilitate the expansion of independently mobile fauna from new guinea.
