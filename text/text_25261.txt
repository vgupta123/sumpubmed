BACKGROUND
the epigenetic process of genomic imprinting enables parent-of-origin expression of a cohort of mammalian genes  <cit> . imprinted genes have been shown to play a pivotal role in embryonic growth, development, placental function and postnatal behaviour and metabolism  <cit> . the distinctive monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is facilitated through asymmetrical epigenetic marks on either the maternal or paternal allele. generally, imprinted genes are arranged in clusters containing differentially marked, cpg rich domains, known as imprint control regions  and/or differentially methylated regions ; the most extensively studied of these marks is dna methylation  <cit> . mammalian dna methylation patterns required for genomic imprinting are subject to periods of dynamic reprogramming during development and are established at different developmental time points, depending on which germline they are transmitted through. paternal dmrs acquire their methylation marks in the prospermatagonia, with completion occurring prior to birth  <cit> ; while dna methylation marks at maternal dmrs are established postnatally in the growing oocyte  <cit> .

following fertilization, a global cascade of dna demethylation is evident in the preimplantation embryos of a number of mammalian species including mouse, rat and cattle  <cit> . this demethylation event occurs actively on the paternal genome in one cell embryos  <cit>  and passively on the maternal genome following each cell division from the two cell stage until blastocyst in mouse  <cit>  and up to the 8-cell stage in bovine  <cit> . interestingly, studies in mice have shown that the dna methylation landscape at the dmr of the imprinted h <dig> gene is resistant to these pan-genomic demethylation events  <cit> . although information is available in mice  <cit>  and there is some information on non-imprinted and imprinted genes in bovine embryos  <cit> , the fate of maternally methylated imprinted gene dmrs remains largely undetermined during the early stages of bovine embryogenesis, especially so between blastocyst stage and implantation. indeed, it has been suggested that murine dna methylation imprints may be dynamic in the early embryo  <cit> . however, this study demonstrated that regions around maternally methylated germ line dmrs may undergo some changes, leaving a core dmr methylated. extensive work has been carried out to elucidate which genes are involved with establishing and maintaining dna methylation marks, and it is now widely accepted that the dna methyltransferase genes  are responsible for establishing dna methylation imprints in the male and female germline  <cit> ; with dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> being primarily implicated with maintenance of methylation marks following dna replication  <cit> . gene targeting studies in mice have demonstrated that the methyltransferases dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt <dig> are indispensable for embryonic survival  <cit> . with regards to dnmt3l, transgenic mice carrying homozygous null mutations are viable  <cit> ; however, dnmt3l-/- male mice are infertile due to reactivation of long interspersed elements  and retrotransposons as well as meiotic catastrophe  <cit> , while females fail to deliver viable pups as a result of hypomethylation at imprinted loci  <cit> . more recently, expression of trim28/kap <dig> and zfp <dig> have been associated with the regulation of epigenetic stability in mouse oocytes and embryos  <cit> . in addition to establishing and maintaining dna methylation marks, evidence suggests that the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase  family members play a central role in active demethylation  <cit> .

in cattle, developmental epigenetic research has primarily focused on cloned bovine embryos, due to the low survival rates of embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer . a high degree of scnt embryonic loss occurs during the preimplantation period  <cit>  with further loss and morphological anomalies  being observed in embryos that successfully implant and progress through gestation  <cit> . it has been suggested that this low survivability   <cit> , may be due to erroneous epigenetic reprogramming  <cit> , such as aberrant dna methylation patterns observed at the imprinted snrpn locus in day  <dig> scnt embryos  <cit> . monoallelic expression and dna methylation patterns of imprinted genes associated with the human epigenetic disorder, beckwith-wiedemann syndrome, have also been shown to be conserved in bovine day  <dig> concepti  <cit> . the role of dna methylation programming has also been highlighted in studies involving dnmt <dig> sirna-based knockdown experiments during in vitro development of bovine scnt embryos. these investigations suggest that a significant increase in development to blastocyst was due to enhanced reprogramming efficiency elicited by dna demethylation in dnmt <dig> knockdown embryos  <cit> . in a recent study using fluorescent labelling techniques, dobbs and colleagues revealed global methylation patterns in pre-implantation bovine embryos  <cit> . results from this study showed that methylation patterns significantly differ between male and female embryos and that, in the blastocyst, the inner cell  mass is less methylated when compared to the trophectoderm , confirming previous findings by hou et al.  <cit> . however, in contrast to the investigations carried out on cloned embryos, non-manipulated in vivo derived embryos have received limited attention, particularly prior to day  <dig> 

in the current study, we investigated the dna methylation profiles at dmrs of six bovine imprinted genes  in in vivo derived embryos at several stages of development, including blastocyst and peri-implanting conceptuses. in addition, the abundance of rna transcripts, and proteins, known to be associated with the establishment and maintenance of dna methylation imprints were determined in embryos at parallel stages of development.

methods
ethical approval
all experimental procedures involving animals were licensed by the department of health and children, ireland, in accordance with the cruelty to animals act,  <dig>  and the european community directive 86/609/ec. all procedures were sanctioned by the university college dublin, ireland animals research ethics committee. all animals were processed in a commercial abattoir.

animal synchronization and embryo collection
collection of in vivo derived bovine embryos was performed using a previously described synchronization protocol  <cit> . briefly, crossbred beef heifers  were synchronized using an 8-day cidr treatment  with administration of a prostaglandin pgf2α analogue  injection one day prior to removal of the cidr. animals were checked for estrus four times daily, from  <dig> h following pgf2α injection. animals that were in standing estrus between 36- <dig> h were inseminated using frozen thawed semen. inseminated animals were slaughtered and embryos recovered from reproductive tracts on days  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

dna modification
isolation and bisulfite modification of dna was carried out using the ez methylation direct method  according to manufacturer’s guidelines. firstly, proteinase k digestion was performed in a  <dig> μl reaction volume, containing  <dig> μg/μl proteinase k and 1× m-digestion buffer, at 50°c overnight. sample input for the digests were as follows; individual day  <dig> or  <dig> μl  of disaggregated day  <dig>  day  <dig> embryonic disc and day  <dig> embryo proper. for trophectoderm  and extraembryonic  samples a  <dig> ul aliquot was used. following this,  <dig> μl of fresh ct conversion reagent  was added directly to the digests which were then incubated at 98°c for  <dig> min and 64°c for  <dig> h. bisulfite dna clean-up was carried out by adding the ct conversion reactions to zymo-spin columns pre-loaded with  <dig> μl m-binding buffer, centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm, washing with  <dig> μl m-wash buffer, desulphonation at room temperature for  <dig> min and a further two washes with  <dig> μl m-wash buffer. samples were eluted in  <dig> μl elution buffer, warmed to 50°c to enhance recovery. liver, kidney and heart samples were modified as in  <cit> . for experiments using limited starting amounts of dna, the dna was extracted using an allprep dna/rna micro kit  and quantified using a qubit® dsdna high sensitivity assay kit and a qubit®  <dig>  fluorometer .

bisulfite pcr
bisulfite pcr reactions were carried out in  <dig> μl reactions using primers outlined in  each pcr reaction contained  <dig> x pcr buffer ,  <dig>  μm forward and reverse primer,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  u platinum taq dna polymerase and  <dig> μl bisulfite dna template. amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation; 95°c  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c denaturation for  <dig> sec, variable °c annealing for  <dig> sec and 72°c elongation for  <dig> sec, with a final elongation step at 72°c for  <dig> min. all reagents were supplied by invitrogen life technologies™.

pyrosequencing
pyrosequencing assays for dmrs at maternally imprinted genes were verified previously  <cit> . the h <dig> assay was designed according to previously identified dmr  <cit>  and verified in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  biotin labeled bisulfite pcr products, verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, were made up to  <dig> μl reaction volumes containing  <dig> μl streptavidin-coated sepharose beads ,  <dig> μl nuclease free h <dig> and  <dig> ul binding buffer . mixtures were agitated, to enable binding of biotin labeled strands to beads, by shaking at room temperature for  <dig> min. template-bead complexes were immobilized to individual prongs on a pyromark q <dig> vacuum manifold  and subjected to a  <dig> sec ethanol wash ;  <dig> sec denaturation step  and final  <dig> sec wash step in  <dig> x pyromark wash buffer. the vacuum manifold was turned off and the bound template-bead complexes released into  <dig> μl primer mixes containing  <dig>  μm sequencing primer and pyromark annealing buffer. internal bisulfite controls were included in each pyrosequencing assay performed. only sequences that passed the internal control  were included in the analysis.

statistical analysis of methylation data
for this study, dmr methylation value was treated as a continuous variable. pairwise group comparison of the variance in methylation for each gene was analysed using levene’s homogeneity of variance test  <cit> , which assumes data are not normally distributed. a p-value threshold of ≤  <dig>  was chosen to identify significant differences in the variance between groups. all analyses were performed using the minitab version  <dig> software package .

gene and protein expression analysis
the tpm values for each gene of interest were retrieved from a bovine embryo rna-seq dataset  <cit> . the tpm values were log transformed and analyzed by the statistical package sas . analysis was performed using general linear model procedure  with day as the main effect. effect of day on embryo/conceptus gene expression were separated by tukey’s test and a p value of <  <dig>  was considered significant. gene expression data are presented as the mean tpm ± se. dna methyltransferase protein analysis was carried out using whole day  <dig> embryos or small fragments of day  <dig> and  <dig> embryos essentially as described previously  <cit> .

experimental model
the methylation profiles of six bovine genes  known to undergo genomic imprinting were analysed  <cit>  . these included the maternally imprinted small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide n gene ; mesoderm specific transcript homolog  gene ; insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor gene ; pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like  <dig> gene ; paternally expressed  <dig> gene  and the paternally imprinted maternally expressed transcript gene . the number of dmr-associated cpg dinucleotides analysed for each gene were as follows: snrpn ; mest ; igf2r ; plagl <dig> ; peg <dig>  and h <dig> . the dna methylation status of each individual cpg was determined by pyrosequencing, with the average methylation status of each gene  calculated for single in vivo embryos at different stages of development .figure  <dig>

investigations performed using mice models  <cit>  have demonstrated that dna methylation at imprinted loci is resistant to early embryonic dna methylation reprogramming events. therefore, we hypothesised that a similar mechanism exists at bovine imprinted loci. to test this hypothesis, the methylation patterns at a panel of dmrs, were assayed in embryos  across the pre- and peri-implantation axis: blastocyst , hatched ovoid embryo , filamentous embryo  and implanting conceptus . in addition, the methylation status of these dmrs was analysed in trophectoderm  and extra embryonic  tissues. for the day  <dig> embryos two sections of the trophectoderm, embryonic disc adjacent  and trophectoderm peripheral , were analysed, as differences in morphology  <cit>  and function  <cit>  have previously been identified between regions adjacent to the embryonic disc and the periphery of the trophectoderm. a minimum of  <dig> individual embryos were assayed at each time point.

RESULTS
dmr methylation during pre-implantation embryogenesis
comparison across the different embryonic stages revealed that the greatest range in methylation values occurred at the day  <dig> blastocyst stage , followed by the day  <dig> hatched ovoid embryos . notably, the range of methylation values for all six genes analysed were narrower at the day  <dig> and day  <dig> embryonic stages .figure  <dig> 
pyrosequencing analysis of dna methylation at six bovine imprinted differentially methylated regions during early embryogenesis. bisulfite pcr and pyrosequencing was performed using genomic dna isolated from embryos  at four separate time points; blastocyst , hatched ovoid embryos , filamentous embryos  and implanting conceptuses . at day  <dig>  trophectoderm embryonic regions adjacent  and peripheral to the embryonic disc  were analysed. trophectoderm samples at day  <dig> were also included in the analysis. an overall trend of imprint stabilization can be observed for the six genes with increasing days of embryonic development, post blastocyst.  methylation values for snrpn, mest, igf2r, plagl <dig>  peg <dig> and h <dig> at day  <dig> had the most significant differences, when compared to days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>   top panel; standard deviations were calculated using individual methylation values  for all genes in each group. overall, standard deviations are greatest in group  <dig>  with the smallest degree of variation occurring in the day  <dig> implanting concepti  and day  <dig> implanting concepti extra embryonic region. bottom panel; average methylation values, plotted with standard deviation values, for embryos isolated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post insemination .



previous studies have shown that methylation at dmrs of imprinted genes is stably maintained throughout early embryonic development  <cit> . for each gene, we compared the variances in sample group methylation across the development time course. for this, each developmental stage was considered a sample group and all possible pairwise group combinations were compared using the levene’s test  <cit>  for homogeneity of variance implemented in minitab. this test does not assume an underlying normal distribution and is appropriate for comparing variances when sample sizes are small  <cit> . we hypothesised that stable inheritance and maintenance of methylation at imprinted loci across the pre-implantation developmental stages analysed will result in non-significant differences in the variance of methylation values between sample groups . in contrast, fluctuations in methylation patterns across the pre-implantation developmental will result in significant differences in the variance of methylation values across sample groups .

pairwise group comparisons revealed statistically significant differences  between the variance in methylation values between the day  <dig> blastocysts relative to the later embryos for all genes. the variance of the plagl <dig> and peg <dig> dmr methylation values at day  <dig> was significantly greater to the variances observed for all three later developmental stages. in addition, the variance of the igf2r methylation at day  <dig> was significantly greater to that for the day  <dig> and day  <dig> embryos. significantly greater variances were also observed for mest , h <dig> and snrpn . notably, pairwise comparison of the variance in methylation values of the six gene-associated dmrs at the later developmental stages  revealed no statistically significant differences . furthermore, day  <dig> and day  <dig> embryonic methylation values were similar to those of adult somatic samples, from heart, liver and kidney . to address the possibility that the observed variability in the blastocyst stage embryos could be due to technical, not biological, variation pyrosequencing analysis was performed using limited starting amounts of dna- representative of the dna content from a single  or half  a bovine blastocyst. variation of dmr methylation between the two groups was assessed using the levene’s test outlined above. no significant differences were observed between the two starting input amounts of dna . however, further analysis of a subset of dmrs  using d <dig> methylation values and methylation values using limited starting amounts of embryonic and somatic  dna samples revealed some significant differences for snrpn and peg <dig>  and no differences for h <dig> . when methylation was analysed using d <dig> methylation values  with low input  d <dig> samples, with same cell equivalents of d <dig> samples, snrpn and peg <dig> showed no significant differences  & s2c ). in a similar experiment using d <dig> samples snrpn showed significant difference, while peg <dig> did not  & s2c ). comparison of d <dig> methylation values  with li somatic and li embryonic methylation values demonstrated that d <dig> values were significantly different to li somatic values and not to li embryonic methylation values  & s2c ).figure  <dig> 
embryonic imprints at day  <dig> and day  <dig> methylation patterns resemble those observed in adult somatic tissues. to investigate whether dna methylation imprints remained stable, levels for each gene  were analysed in several adult somatic tissues ; liver , heart  and kidney  and compared to the average methylation values obtained at day  <dig> and day  <dig> , for each gene. the methylation values were, snrpn; 37% , 42% , 39% , 39%  and 38% , mest; 36% , 34% , 32% , 33%  and 33% , igf2r; 43% , 49% , 43% , 36%  and 38% , plagl1; 30% , 29% , 28% , 36%  and 22% , peg10; 37% , 49% , 47% , 35%  and 35%  and h19; 29% , 32% , 30% , 35%  and 28% .



trophectoderm dmr methylation
as the elongating/filamentous embryo is comprised of embryonic disc and trophectoderm tissues, we analysed and compared the variance in methylation values for each gene-associated dmr for these tissues at the day  <dig> developmental stage. three sample types were included in this analysis—embryonic disc , trophectoderm peripheral  and trophectoderm adjacent to the embryonic disc . comparisons of variance in methylation values were performed for each gene between ed and te, ed and tp, and tp and te. with the exception of the comparison between the ed and te tissues  for mest, there were no significant differences in the variance methylation observed . similarly comparison of variance in methylation values was carried out using data from day  <dig> trophectoderm and day  <dig> embryo samples. with the exception of snrpn  no significant differences were observed.

methylation machinery abundance during bovine embryogenesis
analysis of global transcriptomic data generated by rna-seq profiling of day-  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bovine embryos  <cit> , revealed an overall effect of embryonic stage on the rna transcript abundance  of genes associated with the establishment and maintenance of dna methylation imprints, specifically dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt <dig>  and trim28/kap <dig> . these genes showed a significant temporal decrease in transcript copy number from day  <dig> to  <dig> and day  <dig> to  <dig> . the expression of both dnmt3a and dnmt3b was also significantly reduced in day  <dig> and  <dig> embryos compared to day  <dig> embryos . while, there was a trend for a decline in zfp <dig>  tet1- <dig> and tet1- <dig> mrna abundances over time, this decrease was not statistically different. transcripts for tet and uhrf <dig> family members, although expressed across all stages, were not significantly different. dnmt3l expression was not detected above background levels . in addition to analysis of rna, we also performed western blot analysis to investigate the levels of the dna methyltransferases; dnmt3a, dnmt3a <dig> and dnmt3b, using protein isolated from day  <dig>   <dig> embryos and day  <dig> conceptuses samples . a similar pattern of expression was observed for these proteins that was also present in the rna-seq analysis; demonstrating that both rna and protein molecules are abundant during the period of dna methylation imprint stabilisation.figure  <dig>

discussion
the current study details the methylation dynamics at a panel of differentially methylated imprinted gene loci, during pre- and peri-implantation bovine development. results generated from this investigation have yielded novel information regarding the stability of dna methylation imprints in this early developmental window. we provide evidence suggesting that dmrs may be subjected to a period of reprogramming in cattle, during the ontogeny from bovine blastocyst to hatched ovoid embryo/conceptus.

current understanding of the fate of gametic dna methylation marks at imprinted genes following fertilization has come from studies in mice  <cit> . these investigations, for example, have provided robust information regarding the paternally transmitted h <dig> dmr, demonstrating its stability during early embryonic development. despite limited information regarding the early embryonic stability of maternally derived dna methylation imprints, it is widely accepted that they follow a similar path to that of h <dig>  <cit> . here, we report for the first time a high level of variability in dna methylation at the dmrs of imprinted genes in the bovine blastocyst, relative to levels detected at later stages of peri-implantation embryo development. this is similar to previous results reported in human that showed, using pyrosequencing, variability of dna methylation at dmrs of imprinted genes in single blastocysts  <cit> . these findings suggest that there possibly could be a wave of imprint stabilisation post blastocyst stage, following which, embryonic dmr methylation values become comparable to those observed in adult somatic tissues.

this observed variability in methylation could, however, be due to a number of possible reasons. firstly, it is possible that the variation in dmr methylation observed in the bovine blastocyst may be due, in part, to technical issues, such as amplification bias of maternally- or paternally-derived genome copies involving small starting amounts of template material. to address this, pyrosequencing of each dmr was carried out using small amounts of bisulfite-modified heart and liver dna, equivalent to the dna content of single  and half a bovine blastocyst . while the effect of preferential amplification of maternal or paternal alleles cannot be fully excluded in the current study, there was a lack of statistical differences in dmr methylation between the two limited dna starting concentrations demonstrating reliability of the assays using small amounts of gdna. however, conflicting results were observed when using low starting amounts of d <dig> or d <dig> dna. no differences were observed at the snrpn, peg <dig> or h <dig> dmrs when analysing d <dig> methylation values, but snrpn was significantly different between d <dig> samples, suggesting the possibility of technical variation. secondly, it is possible that there is an overrepresentation of dna from the icm or the te in the day  <dig> samples. previous investigations have demonstrated differential global methylation patterns between the icm and te in bovine blastocysts. however, the results are unclear with reports indicating that the te is more methylated  <cit>  and another showing higher methylation within the icm  <cit> . thirdly, the effect of hormonal treatment during animal synchronization on dmr methylation cannot be excluded as there is evidence to suggest that superovulation/ovarian stimulation regimes may interfere with methylation at the dmrs of imprinted genes in the murine blastocyst  <cit> . fourthly, murine dmrs have been shown to be dynamic during murine pre-implantation development in their ability to expand, contract or shift  <cit> . to identify whether the dmrs interrogated in this study were behaving in a similar manner, and thus contributing to the observed variation, methylation of individual cpgs for each gene was assessed on an embryo by embryo basis in the day  <dig> group . these analyses revealed that variation was consistent across all the cpgs of each dmr, indicating that the methylation variability was unlikely to be due to a small number losing or gaining methylation. finally, previous studies investigating methylation at imprinted genes  in embryonic germ cells, derived from either male or female primordial germ cells, identified that sex can contribute to differential methylation patterns at these loci  <cit> . therefore, we cannot rule out that the sex of the embryos may be having an effect at dmrs at imprinted genes during the blastocyst stage.

subsequent to the variability in methylation at d <dig>  there was no difference in dmr methylation between trophectoderm regions and the embryo proper of implanting conceptuses, illustrating a pan-embryonic stability of dna methylation at dmrs of imprinted gene. considering the role of the trophectoderm in implantation and placenta formation  <cit> , and given the role of genomic imprinting in placental function  <cit> , these results are of particular interest. it has been previously proposed that normal function of the placenta may be impaired through alterations in the epigenetic landscape, such as those observed in cloned bovine placentas  <cit> . here, we show that non-manipulated in vivo derived bovine embryos have a balanced methylation profile at dmrs of imprinted genes across the embryo proper and trophectoderm regions, suggesting that this may be the optimal imprinted gene methylation profile to support implantation and subsequent placental formation.

targeted mining of bovine embryo global transcriptomic data  <cit>  revealed a distinctive temporal rna transcript profile for several key genes associated with establishing and maintaining imprints . high levels of mrna expression were observed during the period of greatest imprint instability, followed by a significant decrease in transcript abundance at later stages of development, in tandem with dna methylation imprint stabilization. this pattern of expression was also observed for dnmt3a, dnmt3a <dig> and dnmt3b, complementing the gene expression profiles. in mice, trim28/kap <dig> maternal knockouts present with severe phenotypic and epigenetic variability resulting in embryonic lethality  <cit> , it has been proposed that an epigenetic complex formed by trim28/kap <dig> and zfp <dig> facilitate imprint maintenance/protection during the period of pre-implantation reprogramming  <cit> . in addition, the de novo and maintenance dna methyltransferases, dnmt3a/b and dnmt <dig>  were shown to interact with zfp <dig> through its co-factor trim28/kap <dig> to maintain methylation imprints in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . taking all things in to consideration, it is likely that trim28/kap <dig> and zfp <dig>  along with the dna methyltransferases dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt <dig> actively facilitate a window of dna methylation reprogramming in bovine embryos post blastocyst development .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first comprehensive analysis of methylation patterns at maternally- and paternally- transmitted imprinted gene associated dmrs during early embryo development in cattle. in contrast to the murine model, our evidence suggests that bovine germline-acquired dna methylation imprints may be susceptible to instability at the blastocyst stage and are subsequently stabilized during a period involving notable increases in the transcription of genes involved in the regulation of dna methylation. however, variation in methylation in bovine blastocysts due to technical issues associated with limited amounts of dna cannot be fully ruled out. single nucleotide polymorphism analysis  to identify the ratio of maternal and paternal alleles, and therefore eliminate/confirm amplification bias, would be the most definitive approach to determine whether blastocyst methylation variability is biological or technical. unfortunately this information was not available for this investigation, but it should be considered in future studies investigating imprinted gene methylation in samples with limited numbers of cells. finally, our studies highlight the usefulness of larger mammalian species as models for investigating epigenetic regulation during embryo development.
