BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions in various organisms are increasingly becoming the focus of study in the identification of cellular functions of proteins. though small scale experiments have contributed significantly to our knowledge of protein-protein interactions, the bulk of the data is available from high-throughput methods like yeast two hybrid  and mass spectrometry of coimmunoprecipitated complexes   <cit> . such data is currently available for h. pylori  <cit> , s. cerevisiae   <cit> , c. elegans  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit>  and h. sapiens  <cit> . however, protein-protein interaction data obtained from high-throughput experiments is thought to have a large number of false positives i.e. interactions that are spurious or biologically irrelevant, and do not occur in the cell  <cit> . this fraction is estimated to be as high as 50% in yeast  <cit> . since the false positives are unknown, there is no consensus on which interactions from these data sets should be used in prediction studies. studies that use all the interactions run the risk of predicting spurious ones  <cit> , while those that completely ignore the high-throughput data are limited by the amount of data from small scale experiments <cit> . for some high-throughput studies, the authors specify the reliable interactions as 'high confidence' or 'core' interactions  <cit>  which have fewer false positives but which do not take into account those low confidence interactions which are known to be true. hence it is important to quantify the reliability of these interactions and identify the true positives i.e. interactions that actually occur in the cell.

several methods have been previously used to identify true interactions from high-throughput experimental data in yeast. sequence homology was used by deane et al.  <cit>  in the form of a paralogous verification method  whereby an interaction in yeast is judged to be true if the concerned proteins have paralogs that interact as well. but these results are limited by the number of proteins that have known paralogs. they also used similarity in gene expression profiles to identify true positives  <cit> . structurally known interactions were used by edwards et al., who compared experimental interactions found in rna polymerase ii, arp2/ <dig> complex and the proteasome with those observed in the 3d structures  <cit> . though this method has a high reliability, it is limited by the number of structures available in protein data bank   <cit> . von mering et al. found the interactions in yeast that are observed in more than one high-throughput experiment to estimate the fraction of true positives  <cit> . the results obtained were surprisingly small in this case due to inherent biases in different experimental methods. database annotations have been used by sprinzak et al. in the form of co-localization data of the interacting proteins and their cellular role to estimate the number of true positive interactions in yeast  <cit> . however, not all model organisms have well annotated genomes. interaction network topology is another means of identifying true interactions. saito et al. used an interaction generality measure , based on the topological properties of the interaction network, to assess the reliability of an interaction  <cit> . bader et al. used screening statistics and network topology to quantify the confidence of each interaction  <cit> . though these methods have a high specificity , they have low sensitivity , since the number of proteins with more than one interaction partners is relatively few.

since none of the methods give a good performance  by themselves, it follows that a combination of methods would perform better. jansen et al. have shown that a combination of genomic features results in a more accurate prediction of the yeast protein interaction network  <cit> . in this study, we use a similar approach of combining various genomic features using naïve bayesian networks to predict the true interactions in high-throughput data sets.

in selecting the genomic features to be used in our model, we decided to combine sequence, structure and database annotation information about the interaction. sequence information was incorporated through homologous interactions. we used our homologous interactions  database  <cit>  to obtain homologs for all high-throughput interactions  <cit> . structure information was incorporated in the form of interacting pfam domains  <cit>  found in the pdb. we used the 3did database to obtain a list of such pfam domains  <cit> . database annotation information was used in the form of gene ontology  terms used to describe the interacting proteins  <cit> .

we computed the reliability of each feature using likelihood ratios and combined their evidence using naïve bayesian networks in order to predict the true interactions from high-throughput data sets. bayes' rule provides a good method to estimate posterior odds of an event in the presence of prior evidence  <cit> . bayesian approaches have also been used frequently in the past to calculate the reliability or to assign probabilities to protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

in this study, we show that an interaction can be judged to be true if either or all of the following are true:

 <dig>  the interacting proteins have homologs that interact,

 <dig>  the interacting proteins each have a pfam domain found to interact with the other in pdb and,

 <dig>  the interacting proteins have at least one identical go annotation.

we used protein-protein interaction data from the database of interacting proteins   <cit>   and intact  <cit>  . we prove our hypothesis first in yeast by estimating likelihood ratios for high-throughput interactions based on the number of known true positives and false positives using bayesian network approaches. based on these results, we estimate the number of true positives in the high-throughput data sets of s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens. the results can be searched at and downloaded from our website  <cit> .

RESULTS
calculating the reliability of each genomic feature
we used protein-protein interactions from high-throughput data sets for yeast as our test set to calculate the reliability of each genomic feature . of these  <dig>  interactions, we chose a set of  <dig> interactions as our gold standard –  <dig> as the positive gold standard and  <dig> interactions as the negative gold standard . our goal was to maximize the interactions identified in the gold positive set  and at the same time minimize the number of interactions identified in the gold negative set .

in these interactions, we identified all those that had homologous interactions. the true positives  were those interactions with homologs that were in the gold positive set, and the false positives  were those that were in the gold negative set. using these values, we calculated the likelihood ratio  for the genomic feature of 'homologous interactions' . similarly, we calculated the likelihood ratios for the other two genomic features – interacting proteins with at least one identical go annotation and interacting proteins having one of  <dig> pfam domains known to interact in pdb. we also calculated the likelihood ratio for the absence of genomic features.

using naïve bayesian networks to combine the evidence of genomic features
we used naïve bayesian networks to combine the evidence of each genomic feature for a particular interaction. since naïve bayesian networks require that the genomic features be conditionally independent of each other, we calculated the pearson's correlation coefficient for a pair of genomic features to ascertain their independence . we then combined the evidence of each interaction by simply multiplying the l values of each genomic feature found for the interaction. thus, to each interaction in the gold set of  <dig> interactions, we assigned an l value based on the genomic features it had. an l value greater than  <dig> represents higher posterior odds of an interaction being true than prior odds . hence all interactions with an l value greater than  <dig> were predicted as true. table  <dig> shows the l values obtained for each possible combination of genomic features supporting an interaction. for instance, an interaction that is supported by the presence of all  <dig> genomic features has the highest l value, thus having the highest probability of being true.

assessing the accuracy of the predictions in yeast
to assess the accuracy of our method, we identified the number of predicted true interactions in the gold positive set and those in the gold negative set respectively. we conducted 10-fold cross-validation on the limited set of yeast high-throughput interactions to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the method. figure  <dig> shows the receiver operating characteristic  curve for our method. each point on the roc curve denotes the sensitivity and specificity obtained on the inclusion of interactions with a lower l value. a particular l value is associated with a specific combination of the  <dig> genomic features . thus, including the interactions supported by the presence of all  <dig> genomic features  in the results gives a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %. on further including interactions supported by interacting pfam domains and similar go annotations , the sensitivity rises to  <dig> % and the specificity marginally decreases to  <dig> %. as interactions supported by each individual feature or other combinations of features that have an l >  <dig>  are included in the results, the sensitivity increases at the cost of specificity. thus our method predicts interactions, which are supported by at least one of the  <dig> genomic features, to be true with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %.

predicting true interactions in all high-throughput data sets
we used our method to assign l values to all interactions in three other high-throughput data sets for c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens  <cit> . we also assigned l values to the interactions in yeast high-throughput data sets  <cit>  that were not part of the gold standard. we predicted all interactions with l >  <dig> as true interactions. table  <dig> shows the distribution of the predicted true interactions across different l values for each species. figure  <dig> shows the percentage of interactions predicted as true in the high-throughput data sets of each species.

authors of the high-throughput data sets usually assign a confidence level to interactions. those interactions that are either reconfirmed experimentally or have a high probability of being true based on some statistical method are deemed as high confidence with the rest being low confidence interactions. we tested the overlap between our predicted true interactions and the high and low confidence data sets given by the authors. as seen in figure  <dig>  more high-confidence interactions are predicted as true in all data sets, except in h. sapiens  <cit> . for instance,  <dig> % of the high confidence interactions in yeast are predicted to be true by our method, as opposed to  <dig> % of the low confidence interactions.

some validated predictions
discussion
we present here a method to identify the true interactions in high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets using a combination of three genomic features. we used the likelihood ratio  to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each genomic feature. we combined the evidence from each genomic feature using naïve bayesian networks. our method gives a sensitivity of  <dig> % which is higher than any of the other methods used so far. our method also has a good specificity at  <dig> %. we chose the three genomic features to maximize the inclusion of all aspects of information about the interactions.

structure information was incorporated through pfam domains found to interact in pdb structures in the 3did database. as would be expected, this feature has the highest accuracy and reliability as shown by its high l value . as seen in the roc curve , this genomic feature gives the lowest number of false positives . however, the number of true positives  is limited by the small number of complex structures in pdb that can be used to identify interacting pfam domains. the sensitivity will significantly improve as the number of structures in pdb increases.

database annotations were included through the use of go annotations of the interacting proteins. this feature shows the second highest reliability . it is also able to identify the maximum number of true positives. indeed, lin et al. have recently shown that go annotations are the dominant contributors in predicting protein-protein interactions  <cit> . as the number of annotated proteins increases, this method promises to be useful in filtering interaction data.

sequence information was included in the form of homologous interactions found using the hint database. homologous interactions do not give the reliability expected , perhaps because they are not limited to orthologous or paralogous interactions. however, it is the only feature that does not require any protein annotations and is useful in identifying true interactions of un-annotated or hypothetical proteins. methods based on network topology  <cit>  are also independent of protein annotations and would be a useful addition to the genomic features. however, we have not considered it in the current study.

though evidence from each feature can independently predict an interaction to be true, a combination of  <dig> or more features performs better . for instance, the combination of interacting pfam domains and similar go annotations  or interacting pfam domains and homologous interactions , has a higher l value than either of the features independently. both combinations increase the sensitivity without much compromise in the specificity. similarly, a combination of similar go annotations and homologous interactions , predicts an interaction to be true with a higher probability than each feature independently. this combination too adds to the sensitivity with only a slight decrease in the specificity. surprisingly, evidence from interacting pfam domains  performs better than that of the combination of the other two features , highlighting the importance of the incorporation of structural evidence.

due to the absence of information about non-interacting proteins, we prepared our gold negative set from proteins that have different subcellular localizations. however, some interactions are transient with interacting proteins residing in the same sub-cellular compartment for only a small fraction of their life time. as a result, some of the interactions in the gold negative set are actually true. thus, the specificity of our method is probably higher than  <dig> %.

using the evidence of the three genomic features, we predicted the number of true interactions in various high-throughput data sets. our prediction of  <dig> % true interactions in yeast high-throughput data sets is in conformance with the previous estimates of the number of false positives in these data sets  <cit> . however, yeast y2h  <cit>  and co-ip data sets  <cit>  show very different numbers of true positives independently – 37% and 73% respectively . the d. melanogaster data set  <cit>  shows a very low rate of true positives. one reason could be that this experiment was performed using most of the predicted transcripts in the d. melanogaster genome, including biologically irrelevant ones. the c. elegans data set  <cit>  includes a higher percentage of true positives than d. melanogaster, perhaps because the experiment was performed only on a restricted set of predicted proteins related to multi-cellular functions. the h. sapiens data set  <cit>  shows the highest number of true positives at  <dig> %. this data set was obtained from a study that focused on the identification of putative protein complexes in the tnf-α/nf-κb signal transduction pathway using co-ip  <cit> . there are two possible reasons for the high number of true positives. firstly, the choice of proteins from a specific signal transduction pathway precludes many random interactions between proteins of unrelated functionality. secondly, the co-ip approach to the identification of protein complexes, and thus interactions, is known to have a low false positive rate of around 20%  <cit> , in comparison to y2h approaches. this is also reflected in the prediction of a larger number  of true positive interactions in the co-ip data sets of yeast <cit>  by our method.

we also studied the overlap of the predicted true interactions with the high-confidence and low-confidence interactions as given by the respective authors. though the number of interactions predicted in high-confidence data sets is higher, 17–28% of the interactions in low-confidence data sets are also predicted to be true, except in the h. sapiens data set. this shows that some low-confidence interactions can be biologically relevant. when compared to other data sets, the predicted true interactions in h. sapiens data set show a much higher overlap  with the low confidence interactions. this is because the high confidence data set given by bouwmeester et al. primarily focuses on interactions, novel or otherwise, that are most likely to be a part of the signalling cascade triggered by tnf-α  <cit> . hence, interactions of proteins that are also part of other systems, like the cell cycle, are not included in this high confidence data set. these include interactions of nucleasome assembly proteins and mcm proteins, among others. other interactions which have been filtered out include those of frequently copurified proteins like the heat shock proteins. in order to limit their interaction map to the tnf-α/nf-κb signal transduction pathway, the authors have chosen a very stringent statistical criterion to identify the interactions of proteins that are expressed well above their normal levels on being triggered by tnf-α  <cit> . as a result, the high confidence data set as given by bouwmeester et al. forms only 10% of the total interactions identified in their study, while our method predicts a large number of low confidence interactions to be true.

we were also able to confirm several of the low confidence interactions, that were predicted as true, in literature using ihop  <cit> . in fact, most of the interactions of the lsm proteins, shown in figure 5b, are found in ihop. several interactions from the human dataset are also found in ihop and the human protein reference database  <cit> . among others, these include the low confidence interactions of the c-rel proto-oncogene with itself, nk-κb p <dig> subunit, nf-κb p100/p <dig> subunits, heat shock cognate  <dig> kda protein and nf-κb beta inhibitor. this further reiterates the biological relevance of a large number of low confidence interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that a combination of genomic features that includes sequence, structure and annotation information, can be used to identify true interactions from high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets. we use likelihood ratios to assess the reliability of each genomic feature and combine their evidence using naïve bayesian networks. we provide a likelihood ratio for each predicted true interaction based on the evidence that supports it. our method has a high sensitivity and a good specificity. the results of our study are available on our website  <cit> for search and download.
