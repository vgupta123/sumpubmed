BACKGROUND
proteases form a complex family of enzymes that possess different catalytic mechanisms with various active sites and divergent substrate specificities  <cit> . proteases hydrolyze peptides in aqueous environments  <cit>  and for years this ability has been utilized in industrial processes like food processing, waste treatment, textiles/detergent applications, and photography/chemical processing . proteases can be classified into four major groups: aspartic, cysteine, metallo and serine proteases  <cit> . protease inhibitors for each of these classes have been described  <cit> . these inhibitors regulate the activity of proteases by binding to the enzyme and eliminating unwanted proteolysis  <cit> . in recent years, proteases and protease inhibitors have gained additional interests in many health related areas as e.g. pathogenic agents by allergy, asthma and obese related illness  <cit> . proteases have been recognized as the most important industrial enzymes accounting for about 60% of the total enzyme market  <cit> .

proteases can be obtained from animal, plant and microbial sources  <cit> . however, microorganisms are the most important sources for industrial applications  <cit>  due to their high yield and productivity and a wide range of biochemical and catalytic properties  <cit> . the genus aspergillus represents a diverse group of filamentous ascomycetous fungi  <cit> , including human, animal and plant pathogens, but also species with a major role in industrial biotechnology  <cit> . several aspergillus species have the ability to produce a variety of proteases .

in this study we have performed a genome survey of several aspergilli based on the protein sequences of verified proteases and pfam domains. curated putative proteases were fed to a combination of protein subcellular localization  predictors to identify the potentially secreted proteins. the results of this in silico comparative secretomics were then tested by enzyme activity assays and proteomic experiments on samples from cultures grown on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp. protease inhibitors were used to determine the contribution of the various protease classes to the total protease activity. finally, by combining comparative genomes, proteomics and enzymology tests, we demonstrate the intriguing variety of protease productivity in the aspergilli.

RESULTS
genome mining and extracellular protein clustering
the genomes of seven aspergillus species, aspergillus niger atcc  <dig>  <cit> , aspergillus nidulans fgsc a <dig>  <cit> , aspergillus oryzae rib <dig>  <cit> , aspergillus flavus nrll  <dig>  <cit> , aspergillus terreus nih  <dig>  neosartorya fischeri cbs  <dig>   <cit>  and aspergillus fumigatus af <dig>  <cit>  , were included in the genomic comparison of protease-encoding genes. on the basis of putative protease clusters  already existing in aspgd, additional putative proteases were found by homology. gene models were manually corrected by multiple sequence alignments. a thorough pfam domain detection was carried out on the aspergillus genomes. proteins containing no known protease-related pfam domain were removed when no additional literature support could be found. at the end,  <dig> extra putative proteases were added to the original set of aspgd protein clusters by jaccard  <cit>  and orthomcl  <cit>   . while investigating the gene presence/absence patterns, genome scale ortholog clusters were utilized to identify species-specific genes.  <dig> out of the  <dig> clusters appeared to be ubiquitous, by containing at least  <dig> protein from each species.  <dig> clusters contained only a single member with no homologs in other species, and were therefore considered “orphan genes”  <cit> . the other clusters cover the species partially .table  <dig>

six different protein scl predictors were applied to all  <dig> putative proteases. by using majority vote  <dig> proteins were considered extracellular, among which  <dig> were in the original aspgd protease clusters .

further classification of proteases was determined by combined manual literature search and pfam annotations. at the end, most putative proteases were classified into four major groups, namely amino, aspartic, metallo and serine, while the remaining genes formed the miscellaneous group .

effect of wheat bran and sugar beet pulp on extracellular protease induction in aspergilli
two cultivation media, minimal medium with 1% wheat bran  and minimal medium with 1% sugar beet pulp , were used to induce extracellular protease production in aspergilli, resulting in an interesting variability of protease activity . among the tested species, n. fischeri produced the highest protease activity on sbp, a.fumigatus produced the highest activity on wb whereas a. flavus had the most moderate activities in both substrates. in all cases wb induced more protease activity than sbp. this was particularly true for a. flavus and a. fumigatus, where the extracellular protease activities on wb were around twice as high as those on sbp. in contrast, for n. fisheri only a small difference  was detected.figure  <dig>

extracellular proteases in  <dig> aspergilli confirmed by proteomics
in order to confirm protease production variability by aspergillus species on different carbon sources, we performed proteomics experiments. in total,  <dig> putative proteases were identified . the identified proteases were then mapped to the extended protease clusters created by comparative genomics, resulting in the presence of  <dig> orthologous groups  in the cultures .table  <dig>

from all identified proteins,  <dig> were found on both wb and sbp, while  <dig> were found uniquely on wb and only two  were found uniquely on sbp. twenty-five out of these  <dig> identified proteases were not predicted to be extracellular according to our combined scl predictions. some of them may be secreted through alternative  secretion systems, as suggested for the spermidine synthase  from a. oryzae.

while comparing proteomics-confirmed protein productivities to enzymology-identified protease activities, a strong correlation was found: wb generally induced more proteases than sbp with all tested aspergillus species taking protein occurrence, abundance and enzyme activities all in consideration .figure  <dig> 
correlation of protease occurrence, abundance and activity in aspergilli on wb or sbp. while growing on  <dig> different crude substrates , the protease occurrence, abundance and the enzyme activity of seven tested aspergillus strains show a general positive correlation. in wb more occurrences of proteases with higher abundance have been identified than in sbp, so as the enzyme activities. the protease abundance is presented in this figure by spectral counts, the amount of identified proteins which is presented in the figure by framed numbers. legends: wb and sbp: protease activity in wheat bran and sugar beet pulp, respectively; wbp and sbpp: protease abundance in wheat bran and sugar beet pulp, respectively.



intriguingly, contradictions were also found when delving deeper into the protease production profile of individual species. for example, a. terreus has the second largest amount of proteases identified in wb  whereas only  <dig> proteins were found in sbp. however, the protease activity in sbp was only around 20% less than in wb . in n. fischeri a lower than average number of proteins was detected by proteomics, but the protease activity was amongst the highest of all species. in a. fumigatus only  <dig> additional proteins  were identified in wb compared to sbp, but the overall protease activity in wb was 40% higher. these findings demonstrate that the total protease activity does not only depend on the total production of proteases. this is likely due to the fact that the enzyme assays measure the combined activity of the available proteases. as they have different specific activities, the total activity is not equal to the sum of the protein amount. for instance, high abundance of a protease with a low specific activity may affect the overall protease activity less than moderate abundance of a protease with a high specific activity.

closer examination of the produced protease activity using protease inhibitors
in order to elucidate the extracellular protease composition in more detail, a series of inhibitor specificity tests was performed. most of the proteases that were identified in aspergilli could be classified into the following major groups: amino, aspartic, metallo and serine. based on literature, the main inhibitor of each group was bestatin  <cit> , pepstatin , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid   <cit>  and phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride   <cit> , respectively . these inhibitors were added to the supernatants and protease activities were compared to those without inhibitors .in general, for all samples protease activity was found to be inhibited predominantly by pmsf . lesser inhibition of activity was detected with edta , bestatin  and pepstatin  .

for pmsf inhibition the ratio of decrease was similar in all species , even though a. niger has the lowest overall protease activity and n. fischeri one of the highest . no significant difference of pmsf inhibited activities was found between wb and sbp in a. oryzae, a. nidulans, a. terreus, n. fischeri and a. niger. although the occurrence and abundance of serine proteases were different in the samples, pmsf inhibited around half of the protease activity in all samples . nevertheless, some of the prevalently produced serine protease clusters may be responsible for at least half of total enzyme activity in these species regardless of carbon source differences. examples could be og- <dig> that contains the lysosomal pro-xaa carboxypeptidase prota   <cit> , og- <dig> that contains the dipeptidyl peptidase ii   <cit> , og- <dig> that contains the carboxypeptidase cpyi   <cit>  and og- <dig> that contains the tripeptidyl-peptidase tppa   <cit>  .

in contrast, a. fumigatus and a. flavus showed noticeable inhibition differences depending on the growth substrate. in a. flavus inhibition of serine proteins on wb showed a 50% higher effect than that on sbp. the opposite was observed for a. fumigatus where sbp seemed to promote more serine-protease activity than wb .figure  <dig>

edta was the second best inhibitor, but a large variation of inhibited activity was detected . a. terreus and a. oryzae showed the highest activity inhibition in wb samples. a. nidulans also showed a significant inhibition effect , though only a small difference between wb and sbp was detected. the enzyme activity in these species did not show strong correlation to their protease profiles. in a. terreus minor amounts of metallo proteases were identified by the proteomics experiments. the spectral counts in wb were comparatively lower than in sbp, even though the activity inhibition was much higher in wb than in sbp, suggesting higher specific activity of metallo proteases present in wb. alkaline protease an <dig>  <cit>  was the only metallo protease detected in a. nidulans cultures by proteomics. the spectral counts of this protein in wb were two-fold higher than in sbp. edta showed an equal effect on this protein with both substrates. in a. oryzae the main metallo proteases identified were neutral protease i , neutral protease ii  and the leucine aminopeptidase   <cit> . they showed higher total abundance in wb than sbp, and the inhibition effects confirmed this.

among all species, a.oryzae and a.niger showed the highest activity inhibition when pepstatin was added to the supernatant produced with wb, indicating the presence of aspartic proteins in these species.in a. niger aspergillopepsin a   <cit>  was found to be the most dominant protease, with a four-fold higher abundance in wb than in sbp.

bestatin mainly inhibits the activity of amino-protease/peptidases. adding bestatin to the supernatants showed minor inhibition of protease activities . this was intriguing because a rather high presence of amino proteases was identified in a. terreus, a. nidulans, a. fumigatus, a. flavus and n. fischeri by proteomics. the putative aminopeptidase og- <dig>  <cit>   was the most abundant amino protease regardless of the carbon source in all species except a. niger .

discussion
we have performed sets of heterogeneous tests on aspergillus species using two complex substrates as carbon sources, aiming to construct a snapshot of fungal life that reflects the variation in protease productivity in different species. in contrast to commonly reported genome-scale protease analysis results  <cit> , besides comparative genomics and proteomics we also included the analysis of enzymatic measurements, which provided further elucidation on the composition of extracellular protease spectra.

by comparative genomics, a rather even distribution  of putative proteases was detected in aspergillus genomes despite genome size variations . among species, the proportions of proteins in each specific subgroup were also consistent, namely 25 ± 1% serine, 18 ± 1% metallo, 8 ± 1% amino and 5% aspartic proteases. further ortholog clustering revealed only a very low number of extracellular “orphan” genes . in fact, more than 60% of the extracellular putative proteases clusters were found to be ubiquitous by containing at least one gene per species. moreover, the major extracellular protease regulator prtt was also found to have a single presence per aspergillus genome  . this might have brought assumptions that in during evolution, moderate divergence of protease genes has occurred in this genus since most of the encoding genes were well conserved at sequence level and only a small number of species-specific genes was identified. if this hypothesis applies, the production rate of extracellular proteases in all aspergillus species should follow the distribution of encoded genes and have similar influence of the regulator prtt, meaning even protein count and quantitative measurement should be detected by proteomics. however, large variations in protein occurrence and abundance were found, indicating more profound mechanisms might be playing important roles.

for example, a. flavus and n. fischeri contain almost identical percentages of putative extracellular proteases in the genomes, but when cultivated on the same carbon sources a double amount of proteases and even higher abundance were identified in a. flavus. should the protease productivity in aspergilli follow the distribution of protease encoding genes, the production of each specific subgroup of protease would be consistent among categories and species. indeed at least one semi-ubiquitous protease ortholog group of genes were identified for each sub-category of proteases on at least one of the substrates, such as og- <dig>   <cit> , og- <dig>   <cit> , og- <dig>   <cit>  and og- <dig>   <cit> . moreover, a larger number of serine proteases were identified in all species, which correlates with the serine protease encoding genes being the largest subgroup of proteases in aspergilli. however when quantitative measurements  were taken into account this correlation was absent because the most abundant individual proteases were never in the serine group, neither did the sum of abundances of the total serine group per species make this the dominant group . in a. flavus , a. fumigatus , and a. oryzae  the most abundant protease belong to the amino protease group, while in a. nidulans  and a. terreus  the most abundant proteases were metallo proteases. in the other species aspartic proteases  were more abundant. taking a. niger as an example, the highest amount of serine proteases were indeed identified in the supernatant. however, based on comparative genomics the second most abundant group should be the metallo proteases, but no metallo protease was detected by proteomics on either substrate, which could possibly indicate that some of the proteases of the other classes also require metal ions  <cit> . the second most abundant group detected in a. niger were the aspartic proteases, including pepa   <cit> , opsa   <cit>  and opsb   <cit> . this demonstrated that even on the same substrate protease occurrence and abundance in aspergillus species can differ significantly.

although in industrial applications the productivity of proteases usually refers to the production rate of proteases per time per unit, in this study we aim to construct a snapshot of aspergilli life style which reflects the protease production mechanisms, therefore the productivity measurements of proteases did not only include the occurrence or abundance of proteins but also the enzyme activities.

summarizing the comparison results of genomics, proteomics and enzymology tests, a general trend was detected. wb induced higher total protease activity, richer proteomics profiles and more protein abundance than sbp. this strongly suggests that in aspergilli, carbon source difference is the most important factor that influences protease productivity . this was further confirmed by the fact that using glucose  or glucose plus casein  only low protease induction could be detected in a. nidulans while sampled at the same time point as the wb or sbp cultures .

while outside the scope of this study, it should be mentioned that it has been frequently reported that proteases are largely produced upon environment-induced cell lysis/damage  <cit> , especially with sugar or nitrogen depletion  <cit> . in our analysis, wb-based substrates showed higher protease activity as well as profiles than sbp-based substrates. this may indicate that wb cultivation resulted in a faster growth rate and earlier sugar depletion, and has therefore promoted an earlier production of proteases  <cit> . to further reveal the mechanisms behind aspergillus protease productivity, aspects such as sugar consumption and fungal growth rate should be taken into account in future studies.

besides amino, aspartic, metallo and serine proteases, a certain amount of ubiquitin and trypsin proteases were also detected by proteomics. the specificity of these proteases was not tested due to the unavailability of inhibitor kits. although very low abundance was found for these proteins, these proteins may also take part in the total extracellular protease activity in aspergilli.

other factors may also cause variability between individual aspergillus species. ph has been reported to be one of these factors  <cit>  and some of the data of this study supports this assumption. for example, an <dig>  has been reported to be an acidic protease  <cit>  and was not detected in a. nidulans . in contrast, the ortholog of this protein in a. niger  had high abundance   <cit> .

finally, even though  <dig> well known protein scl predictors were employed in order to guarantee the accuracy of extracellular protease prediction, improvements could still be made for secretome prediction. among all six used tools the prediction rate varied largely. the wolf-psort prediction fitted best with the proteomics results, while multi-loc was most different from this . interestingly, although with low area abundance  <dig> proteases were detected extracellularly by proteomics that lack a translocation signal peptide. most of them were found in a. flavus and a.terreus ,  <dig> were found in a. oryzae and the rest disseminated among the other species. if this was not caused by cell lysis or leakage, these proteins can be considered as indications of alternative secretion systems in aspergilli. hardly any of these proteins were correctly predicted by the scl predictors we used. hence, this study may also be of value as a testing or training set to improve currently existing prediction methods.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a series of in silico and biological experiments to gain understanding of protease production in aspergilli. according to the results of comparative genomics aspergillus species contain a similar proportion of protease encoding genes with serine proteases as the biggest group. the proteomics and enzymatic experiments generally confirm this composition, as serine proteases indeed make up the largest subcategory in the protease spectrum across the species. furthermore, taking carbon source differences into account, wheat bran resulted in a higher induction of proteases than sugar beet pulp. an interesting variation of total protease activity, composition of the protease spectrum, and their abundance were observed between the species. the broadest set of proteases was found in a. flavus, while the highest overall protease abundance was found in a. niger, and the highest protease activity was detected for a. fumigatus in wheat bran and for n.fischeri in sugar beet pulp. it is very likely that even cultivated in an identical environment, the tested aspergillus species were experiencing different physiology when sampled at the same time point. concerning the high protein sequence conservation level  among clustered proteases, it is likely that the variation of protease productivity is caused by more complicated mechanisms such as gene regulation related to environmental changes by carbon source differences  <cit>  but not by enzymatic differences between the orthologous proteases themselves.
