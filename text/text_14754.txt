BACKGROUND
anaplasma phagocytophilum is a tick-borne pathogen in the order rickettsiales that is increasingly recognized as a cause of disease in humans and animals world-wide  <cit> . it causes the potentially fatal disease of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, which typically manifests as a flu-like illness accompanied by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. it was initially recognized in the early 1990's when patients from wisconsin and minnesota developed febrile illness following a tick bite  <cit> . since that time the number of human cases has increased annually; between  <dig> and  <dig> the reported incidence in the u.s. increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cases/million persons/year  <cit> . the case fatality rate was  <dig> % and the hospitalization rate was 36%. in massachusetts during the  <dig> transmission season there were  <dig> confirmed cases with  <dig>  requiring hospitalization  <cit> . the human disease is also present in europe and asia  <cit> . a recent study of  <dig> a. phagocytophilum-infected patients in china reported a mortality rate in this cohort of  <dig> %  <cit> . in the u.s., there has been a parallel increase in cases of the disease  <cit>  and seroprevalence  <cit>  in dogs in the eastern and upper midwestern states. the tick vectors in the u.s. are ixodes scapularis and ixodes pacificus and wild rodents are the main reservoirs of human infections. a. phagocytophilum also infects numerous other mammalian species including ruminants, horses, cats, and bears and the symptoms are extremely variable, with some mammalian species exhibiting acute disease and others only persistent asymptomatic infections  <cit> . for example, a. phagocytophilum strains isolated from deer in the u.s. can have a slightly different 16s rrna sequence and be uninfective to mice and it is thought, humans  <cit> . in europe, this agent has been known to cause disease of ruminants for > <dig> years, yet there have been few human infections  <cit> . the genome sequence is available for a single strain of a. phagocytophilum derived from an infected human in the u.s. and it is apparent that, although this strain lacks type ii, iii, v and vi secretion systems, a type iv secretion system  is present  <cit> . as in other members of the rickettsiales, the t4ss of a. phagocytophilum is organized differently from most gram-negative bacteria with the component vir genes distributed between three major genome locations  <cit> .

the t4ss typically encodes a membrane-spanning multiprotein complex that forms a transmembrane channel through which solutes can pass into host cells. it can mediate transfer of dna and proteins into eukaryotic host cells, interfere with host signaling, and is essential for the survival of intracellular bacteria  <cit> . in a. phagocytophilum, which preferentially colonize neutrophilic white blood cells, it is thought that the t4ss secretes virulence factors that are responsible for subverting innate immunity and inhibiting host cell apoptosis  <cit> . interestingly, there appears to be differential transcription of the t4ss in ticks and in the mammalian host with virb <dig> and virb <dig> upregulated during infection of human neutrophils and different virb <dig> paralogs expressed in mammalian and tick cells  <cit> . there is evidence that virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig> are exposed on the outer membrane surface in the rickettsiales  <cit> , which has stimulated interest in their potential use as vaccine candidates. this possibility has been investigated more extensively in the related organism anaplasma marginale  <cit> . in a. marginale, unlike many other surface-exposed proteins, the t4ss proteins are conserved between strains  <cit> . also, cattle immunized with outer membranes and protected against challenge infection respond with igg and t cells to vir proteins, notably virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig>  to date, only two t4ss substrates have been identified and partially characterized in a. phagocytophilum: the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein, anka, and the anaplasma translocated substrate  <dig>  ats- <dig>  anka translocates to the host nucleus and interacts with dna  <cit> , while ats- <dig> is imported into the mitochondria where it is proposed to interfere with the induction of apoptosis  <cit> .

in this study, we compared the structure and diversity of the t4ss in different strains of a. phagocytophilum infecting humans, dogs, rodents and ruminants. most diversity was found in the proteins thought to be surface-exposed, which may be associated with the different virulence and cell invasion properties of this species.

RESULTS
the vir loci were sequenced in eight strains of a. phagocytophilum; seven of these were strains for which previous structural information was not available and included organisms originally isolated from u.s. dogs , a rodent , a horse , the ruminant ap variant  <dig> strain  and two strains from norwegian sheep . the human hz strain was also resequenced, as optical mapping had suggested a possible error in the previously sequenced virb <dig> locus. the data indicated considerable diversity in the individual vir loci between strains that will be discussed below. in all strains, however, as noted previously  <cit> , the vir loci were distributed mainly in three gene clusters comprising: virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig> and vird4; virb2′s and virb42; and virb <dig>  virb <dig>  and the four virb <dig> paralogs . these three loci may each be transcribed polycistronically  <cit> , although it is clear that t4ss structure in the rickettsiales is unique and more complex than initially thought. the number of virb <dig> paralogs was different between strains with the human hz strain having the least  and the ruminant strains having the most . the description of the t4ss components presented here follows the functional classification described by alvarez-martinez and christie  <cit> .

inner membrane channel/scaffold subunits: virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb10
the most conserved of these subunits are virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig>  with few differences between strains. virb <dig> has been linked in agrobacterium tumefaciens with pilus assembly and substrate translocation  <cit> . it is absolutely conserved between strains with no amino acid changes and conforms to the typical virb <dig> structure. two alpha-helical domains for insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane are strongly predicted by tmpred. virb <dig>  proposed to function as a nucleation factor during the assembly of t4ss  <cit> , is also well conserved, particularly virb8- <dig> in the polycistronic transcription locus . virb <dig>  proposed to function as a scaffold across the entire cell envelope  <cit> , is also generally well-conserved with the exception of one ruminant strain, apnorlamb-v <dig>  which has  <dig> amino acid substitutions with respect to aphz . however, all a. phagocytophilum virb10′s, including apnorlamb-v <dig>  have two strongly predicted transmembrane domains, which supports their function as membrane scaffolding subunits in these organisms.

of these inner membrane channel subunits, the data on virb <dig> are the most interesting. all virb <dig> subunits that have been described possess a highly hydrophobic membrane domain including five or more predicted transmembrane domains  <cit> . some virb <dig> proteins also have an extended c-terminal hydrophilic domain that has been proposed to protrude through the t4ss into the target cell, or may be proteolytically released from the n-terminal domain and then translocated into the target cell. evidence has been obtained for surface exposure of extended virb <dig> in some rickettsiales  <cit> . of all the membrane channel subunits, the most sequence diversity between a. phagocytophilum strains was in the four virb <dig> paralogs . although there were no amino acid changes in the virb6- <dig>  virb6- <dig> and virb6- <dig> paralogs between human, dog and rodent strains, the ruminant and horse strains had numerous substitutions throughout each molecule, agreeing with the closer evolutionary relationship between strains infecting humans and dogs in the u.s. . furthermore, major differences in repeat number and sequence were found in the c-terminal repeat region of virb6- <dig>  in ruminant and horse strains, with the horse strain showing the least variability from aphz.

the only amino acid differences detected between the human, dog and rodent strains were in the virb6- <dig> subunit. virb6- <dig> in these strains contains four repeat regions  and variability in repeat number, order and sequence were found mainly in r <dig> and r <dig> . within r <dig> , the only difference detected was in apdog <dig> which had  <dig> and  <dig> partial of  <dig> bp repeat units , compared to  <dig> and  <dig> partial repeats in the apdog <dig>  apjm and aphz virb6- <dig> r <dig>  optical mapping of the dog <dig> genome and comparison with aphz suggested that the sequence obtained previously for the human hz strain virb6- <dig> was incorrect . this was confirmed by pcr and sequencing, and mapped specifically to the 3′-most r <dig> region . because of its size and unusual composition it was only possible to resolve this sequence using the long read-length pacific biosciences technology . the corrected virb6- <dig> r <dig> of aphz, totaling  <dig>  kb, differed from the original by  <dig>  kb of additional sequence composed exclusively of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp  repeat units, giving a complex repeat structure containing  <dig> and  <dig> partial repeat units compared to  <dig> and  <dig> partial in the original sequence. further, the 5′- and 3′-most  <dig>  kb of this complex structure are identical in sequence, and the 3′-most  <dig>  kb of each of these segments is repeated again in the center of r <dig> . although the possibility exists that the aphz population from which we isolated gdna differs within the virb6- <dig> r3/r <dig> repeat regions from the population used to generate cp <dig>  the fact that all strains investigated herein presented expansive r3/r <dig> regions  would contradict that. instead, it is more plausible that the existence of  <dig>  kb of identical repeats at the ends of the aphz r <dig> may have lead to the excision of most of its sequence during construction/propagation of those libraries. interestingly, virb6- <dig> r <dig> and r <dig> were identical both in size and sequence in the dog <dig> and rodent strains despite differing markedly from the hz and dog <dig> strain regions . within r <dig>  these strains had  <dig> additional  <dig> bp repeats compared to aphz and one more compared to the dog <dig> strain. however, differences between strains were most dramatic within r <dig>  not only was this region in apdog1/apjm  <dig>  kb larger than in aphz bringing the total number of repeats to  <dig> and  <dig> partial, but intriguingly, the repeat pattern was completely unrelated to that in the hz strain. also, the dog <dig> and rodent strain r <dig> lacked t1b repeat units, while having a third type  <dig> repeat variant, namely t2c, which differed from t2b by  <dig> snp and a  <dig> bp deletion . partial analysis of the apdog <dig>  <dig> reads spanning r <dig>  showed that the order of the 5′- and 3′-most three repeat units differed from either the hz or dog1/rodent strain r <dig> repeat patterns . notably, our preliminary analyses of the horse and ruminant  <dig> reads suggest the absence of distinct r <dig> and r <dig> regions in virb6- <dig> in these strains. rather, the few repeat units identified to date appear to be a combination of r <dig> and r <dig> repeats . it is also unclear if the ~ <dig> kb and ~ <dig> kb pcr products generated with primers ab1393/ <dig> in apvar- <dig> and apnorlamb-v <dig>  respectively , are composed mainly of repeats, or alternatively if a fifth virb- <dig> gene paralog exists in these strains. taken together, the data presented here clearly demonstrate the extreme variability of the t4ss virb6- <dig> subunit among a. phagocytophilum strains. although the differences between the more closely related human, dog and rodent us strains were mainly within repeat-laden regions, the fact that an extensive, distinct repeat pattern was maintained in two strains would speak against the possibility that the variability may be attributed solely to the highly recombinogenic nature of such structures. worth noting, camp ripley, where the infected jumping mouse was captured  is only ~ <dig> miles away from the city of baxter, mn, where dog <dig> resides. although there are no records of where this dog may have actually acquired the infection, it presented with severe clinical disease in  <dig> 

the unusual structure and likely antigenicity of the c-terminal region of the a. phagocytophilum virb6-4′s is apparent in hydrophobicity plots . what specific properties these distinct repeat patterns may confer onto each strain awaits functional analysis of these proteins in a. phagocytophilum. the corrected virb6- <dig> translated protein had a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  da containing  <dig>  amino acid residues compared to molecular weights of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  da for the hz strain virb6- <dig>  virb6- <dig> and virb6- <dig>  respectively. interestingly, the predicted acidity of the virb6′s also increased from virb6- <dig> to virb6- <dig> . the apdog1/apjm virb6- <dig> polypeptides had a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  da containing  <dig>  amino acids, and a pi of  <dig> . despite these dissimilarities, at least eight transmembrane segments were predicted for all virb <dig> paralogs.

periplasmic/outer membrane channel subunits: virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb9
several other t4ss subunits contribute to the secretion channel across the periplasm and outer membrane. virb <dig> subunits are typically small lipoproteins that may stabilize virb <dig>  <cit> . in a. phagocytophilum strains a putative virb <dig> is absolutely conserved between strains and may be lipid modified through an n-terminal cysteine on the mature molecule. virb <dig> is hydrophilic and also localizes to the periplasm and outer membrane. in a. tumefaciens the c-terminal region of virb <dig> is part of the outer membrane protein channel and is surface accessible  <cit> . there is also evidence for surface exposure of virb <dig> in ehrlichia chaffeensis and a. phagocytophilum <cit> . virb9- <dig>  which is encoded on the polycistronic virb81vird <dig> transcript  <cit> , has a strongly predicted signal peptide and two transmembrane helices. of all the potentially exposed components of the t4ss, virb <dig> of a. phagocytophilum appears to be the least diverse among strains. there are some amino acid substitutions in ruminant and horse strains  but in the other strains virb9′s are unchanged .

unlike virb9′s, virb2′s are the most diverse of all t4ss subunits in a. phagocytophilum, in terms of both copy number and sequence. virb <dig> proteins are typically constituents of pili and of the secretion channel and their diversity in anaplasma suggests the possibility of exposed, antigenically variable structures. in a. marginale, virb <dig> is expressed together with the major outer membrane protein msp <dig> on a sequence-variable polycistronic transcript  <cit> . the mechanism of expression in a. phagocytophilum is not known. virb2′s of other genera are typically small hydrophobic proteins with a long signal peptide sequence and two hydrophobic alpha helices for integration into the cytoplasmic membrane. this also appears to be the case for a. phagocytophilum. the virb <dig> paralogs in the different strains are predicted to have two hydrophobic alpha-helices of lengths 22+/− <dig> and 20+/− <dig>  amino acids and signal peptides of length 27+/− <dig> amino acids. this is true despite their sequence diversity . as with many other t4ss components, the ruminant and horse strains are more distant taxonomically in virb <dig> sequence compared to virb2′s of human and dog strains. alignment of all virb <dig> paralogs and orthologs shows that sequence diversity is primarily localized to two hypervariable regions either preceding an n-terminal cysteine or close to the c-terminus . this is similar to the hypervariable regions found among virb <dig> paralogs of a. marginale <cit> .

energetic subunits: virb <dig> and virb11
atpases are typically used in t4ss to energize substrate transfer and have been found in every t4ss described. in gram-negative bacteria these are typically integral membrane proteins encoded by genes residing upstream of virb <dig> . this is true for all strains of a. phagocytophilum and it has been suggested that this arrangement of multiple virb <dig> paralogs and virb <dig> may allow assembly of an antigenically variable surface organelle  <cit> . the energetic subunit itself, virb4- <dig>  is however, well conserved between strains. the most distant taxonomic relationship was found between human and ruminant strains . the other energetic subunit, virb <dig>  was also well-conserved between strains .

type  <dig> coupling protein: vird4
type  <dig> coupling proteins such as vird <dig> are atpases that function in substrate recognition and translocation using the t4ss. they are associated with most effector translocator systems. they typically possess a minimum of two n-terminal transmembrane domains. often most heterogeneity exists in these n-terminal regions  <cit> . the a. phagocytophilum vird4′s conform somewhat to this stereotype with three strongly predicted n-terminal transmembrane segments. as with the other atpases of the a. phagocytophilum t4ss, there is little variation in vird <dig>  a total of  <dig> amino acid substitutions of which  <dig> are n-terminal but more  are c-terminal. again, the evolutionary relationships among vird <dig> sequences position the ruminant and horse strains more distantly to the u.s. dog, human and rodent strains .

CONCLUSIONS
a. phagocytophilum represents a recent reclassification of intracellular organisms infecting different animal species and humans and causing diverse disease symptomatology  <cit> . these bacteria were previously known as ehrlichia phagocytophila, ehrlichia equi, and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. despite the differences within this species, the overall genome structure and synteny of the t4ss is maintained. however, gene structural analysis reveals evidence of gene duplication and considerable diversity of t4ss components in strains infecting different animals. taxonomic trees suggest a close evolutionary relationship of a. phagocytophilum strains infecting u.s. humans, mice and dogs and a more distant relationship with ruminant and horse strains. this relationship is not unique to the t4ss but is also supported by similar taxonomic trees of other a. phagocytophilum proteins of conserved metabolic function . within the t4ss multicomponent membrane complex, the energetic and internal scaffolding protein components are the most conserved. in contrast, components that form the proposed exposed structures of the t4ss, such as virb <dig> and virb <dig>  are more variable. t4ss are important virulence determinants of bacteria, therefore these differences may result in the different infectivity and virulence profiles observed with different strains. it will be of interest to determine the molecular architecture of virb <dig> paralogs in different strains, including interactions with other t4ss components and effectors. of the known surface exposed components of the t4ss, virb <dig> is the most conserved. this protein has been proposed as a vaccine component against a. marginale and may also be suitable against a. phagocytophilum.
