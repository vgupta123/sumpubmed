BACKGROUND
vacuolar h+-atpases are large multi-heteromeric protein complexes located at endomembranes of all eukaryotic cells. plant v-atpase has been identified at the vacuolar and various other endomembranes, and also at the plasma membrane  <cit> . the total molecular mass of v-atpase is estimated to surpass  <dig> kda. v-atpase pumps protons into membrane-surrounded intracellular compartments at the expense of hydrolysis energy of atp  <cit> . v-atpases share a common structure composed of a ball-like head, a membrane-intrinsic part and connecting stalks similar to atp-producing f-atp synthases. biochemical examinations of the subunit composition revealed that v-atpases are built from up to  <dig> subunits. the protein subunits are denominated vha-a through h for soluble components protruding into the cytoplasm , and vha-a, c, c', c", d and e for membrane-associated subunits   <cit> . in plants, the molecular characterisation of vha-subunits is only beginning to include also the genes that were identified recently  <cit> . following the cloning of cdna sequences coding for vha-a, -b, -c, and -e until  <dig>  vha-d, -f, -c and -g were cloned from a. thaliana, oat and barley  <cit> . however, the first complete set of subunit sequences only became available with the sequencing of the genome of a. thaliana  <cit> . the second set was cloned from the halotolerant, facultative cam plant mesembryanthemum crystallinum  <cit> , and a third set is now available from rice. a comparative analysis of the genes/ests revealed that arabidopsis and mesembryanthemum express a similar set of subunits  <cit> . a detailed analysis of the sequences from both species showed that all examined subunits share the same properties in binding of atp and conducting protons through the proteolipid ring  <cit> . an important question concerns the composition of the plant v0-sector since its subunit composition is not resolved yet. vha-a is the subunit with the highest molecular mass within the v-atpase and reveals a bipartite structure. as first shown in yeast, vha-a consists of a  <dig> kda hydrophilic n-terminal domain and a hydrophobic, membrane-spanning c-terminus  <cit> . interestingly, li and sze  <cit>  could not observe the vha-a subunit in functional v-atpase of oat. therefore, they suggested a role of vha-a in assembly of plant v-atpase. the conclusion is in contrast to results in yeast where site directed mutagenesis had allowed to identify amino acids involved in the mechanism of proton translocation across the membrane. mutant yeast cells devoid of vha-a or complemented with modified vha-a variants exhibited the conditional phenotype of v-atpase deficiency  <cit> . another novel subunit in plants that was only addressed recently is vha-h. vma13p being the yeast orthologue of vha-h was cloned and represents the only crystallized subunit of v-atpase at present  <cit> . vha-h is considered to activate and regulate v-atpase by functionally coupling atp hydrolysis to proton flow through the vo-domain  <cit> .

the aim of the study was to improve the understanding of v-atpase distribution in plant cells with emphasis on the localization of vha-a and vha-h in the v-atpase structure. three specific questions were answered using different methodology:  is vha-a part of the v-atpase structure?  where are different subunits localized within plant cells?  is fret a suitable method to investigate subunit interaction within the complex, for example between vha-a and vha-c, and vha-h and vha-b.

RESULTS
primary structure of vha-a
from the database dbest  a cdna fragment from m. crystallinum was identified  with similarity to known genes coding for vha-a in yeast. using race-pcr a full length cdna was obtained with a size of  <dig> bp. its open reading frame encoded a hypothetical protein of  <dig>  kda. database search with the program fasta revealed the highest similarities to the entries at2g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  from the a. thaliana genomic database and also significant similarity on the amino acid level to the genes stv <dig>  and vph <dig>  from s. cerevisiae. these two latter genes are coding for isoforms of the yeast  <dig> kda subunit whereas all other subunits of the yeast vacuolar atpase are encoded by one gene each. the sequence alignment between the newly cloned amino acid sequence from m. crystallinum, the three isogenes from a. thaliana and the two isogenes from yeast  indicates a structure with two distinct segments distinguished by their degree of similarity: the n-terminus with a low degree of sequence conservation  and the c-terminus  with a higher degree of conservation between the sequences. this corresponds to the above mentioned domain structure of s. cerevisiae vha-a with a cytoplasmic and a membrane-integrated domain. the heterogeneity in the n-terminus is characterised through a high number of deletions and insertions most remarkably between the amino acid positions gly <dig> to ile <dig>  and gly <dig> to gln <dig>  in contrast to all other vha-sequences, in yeast-stv <dig> this region contains additional sequence insertions of approximately  <dig> amino acids. sequence variation between vha-a from distinct species and paralogues within same species continues until glu <dig>  other domains of the n-terminus vary to a lesser extent. the heterogeneity decreases in direction to the membrane-spanning c-terminus.

the n-terminal amino acids of vha-a that are conserved in all species are characterised by an above average portion of amino acids with an acid or aromatic character. a comparison of the first  <dig> amino acids of vha-a from  <dig> different species showed the presence of  <dig> amino acids conserved throughout all species,  <dig> of which have acidic and  <dig> aromatic residues. in all sequences compared the representation of aromatic amino acids is higher than the average. in yeast it was shown that sequence motifs with aromatic amino acid residues are involved in the targeting of proteins  <cit> . an assignment of vha-a sequences from a. thaliana and m. crystallinum to the distinct yeast isoforms vph <dig> and stv <dig>  in order to define orthologous genes, was not possible on basis of the amino acid sequence alignment. the comparison of the c-termini revealed a higher degree of sequence conservation interrupted through various short insertions or deletions. the sequence was analysed for secondary structures  and membrane topology . the prediction correlated regions of high sequence conservation with the localisation of putative transmembrane domains . furthermore, these hypothetical transmembrane domains are in accordance with the membrane-topology suggested by leng et al.  <cit>  for the yeast vph <dig> protein. mutations in single amino acids of vph <dig> have previously allowed the identification of  <dig> charged amino acids in the membrane spanning helices of the c-terminus whose mutation strongly affected  or fully inhibited  transmembrane h+-transport, although they did not affect the assembly of the vacuolar atpase  <cit> . these functional amino acids are also conserved in mc-vha-a.

detection of vha-a in membrane preparations in vitro
for further examination of mcvha-a, antisera were raised against two polypeptide fragments, i.e. a n-terminal  <dig> kda polypeptide and a  <dig> kda domain located between predicted transmembrane helices  <dig> and  <dig>  both were expressed heterologously in e. coli using the primer combination a-nterm-f and a-nterm-r, and a-memb-f and a-memb-r, respectively. the derived pcr-products were cloned into the expression vector pcrt7-nt , introduced and expressed in e. coli. the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda polypeptides were purified to homogeneity by chromatography on ni-nta and by preparative sds-page. the  <dig> kda polypeptide was recognized by a purified antibody against yeast vph <dig>  <cit>  . the antiserum produced in guinea pig reacted with the heterologously expressed protein an-term . the presence of vha-a was investigated in plant endomembranes and soluble fractions rapidly prepared from  <dig> week old m. crystallinum plants. in the soluble and the membrane-fraction, the serum against mcvha-an-term identified two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses between  <dig> and  <dig> kda . after increasing the nacl concentration to  <dig> mm, the apparently full size  <dig> kda band was detected in the membrane fraction corresponding to the expected size of untruncated mcvha-a . to test whether the addition of nacl to the membrane preparation affected the purification efficiency of other v-atpase subunits from the v1-sector, membranes and soluble fractions purified with buffer containing either  <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl were also reacted with antibodies against vha-e  <cit>  and anti vha-di recognizing vha-b and di  <cit> . the latter authors demonstrated that this antibody marked both vha-a and -b. the increased nacl concentration had no effect on the labelling strength of vha-e and vha-a/b . interestingly, also mcvha-a, -b and -e were detected both in the membrane and soluble fractions.

to examine the sensitivity of vha-a against proteases, membranes were isolated in second approach, in the absence and presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail . without protection from proteolysis, a band at about  <dig> kda and a doublet band above  <dig> kda were predominant. in the sample with protease inhibitor, the  <dig> kda band appeared although as one of five bands of similar intensity if decreasing transfer efficiency of high molecular mass polypeptides from the gel to the membrane is assumed. apparently, vha-a is prone to degradation. however, the results also indicate that vha-a is part of v-atpase. to further prove that tentative conclusion, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti vha-an-termand anti vha-amemb followed by western blot analysis with anti vha-e and anti-vha-a . each control, i.e. immunoprecipitation without serum and with preimmune serum, gave the expected results of no response . with serum, the  <dig> kda band of vha-a and the dimer of vha-e was seen. apparently, immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against the n-terminus as well as the membrane part of vha-a pulled down a complex also containing subunits of the v <dig> section, and thus probably the holocomplex.

immunochemical analysis of vha-distribution
a more detailed analysis of the distribution of the vha-subunits in the plant cell was performed by immuno-labelling of maize root tip cells. to highlight the distribution of the different vha-subunits in the cell, squashed maize root cells were incubated with anti vha-a, anti vha-e or anti vha-an-term. fig  <dig> shows the staining patterns of the antibodies in young cells devoid of large vacuoles , cells with beginning vacuolization  and older cells with many vacuoles of 2– <dig> μm diameter . in cells devoid of large vacuoles, anti vha-e as well as anti-vha-a marked punctuated compartments whereas in cells with developed vacuoles a nearly complete staining of the tonoplast and an unsteady staining of other small cellular compartments was observed. in a converse manner, anti-vha-an-term did not stain the tonoplast of cells of various vacuolisation state. the staining with anti-vha-an-term revealed a distinct reticulate pattern and a staining of the nuclear membrane reminding of er-labelling.

a double immuno-labelling-technique  <cit>  was then employed to identify the antibody-marked intracellular compartments in detail. the selected antibodies were directed against the aquaporin γ-tip located in the tonoplast of the lytic vacuole  and against marker components of the endoplasmic reticulum  . the results of this immuno-staining are shown in fig.  <dig>  in cells with developed vacuoles, anti-γ-tip-labelling of the tonoplast  co-localised completely with anti-vha-a . anti vha-e labelled similar structures as anti-vha-a and co-localised also with anti-γ-tip on the tonoplast . a co-staining of root cells with anti-vha-a and the er-marker anti-calreticulin was then performed. anti-calreticulin marks a specific er-network including the nuclear membrane . the double labelling with antibodies against vha-a  or vha-e  showed no significant co-localisation of the typical tonoplast staining with the er-marker. when performing a co-labelling of maize root cells with anti-calreticulin  and anti-vha-an-term  revealed a complete co-labelling of the two markers .

for high resolution, immunogold labelling with anti vha-an-term and anti vha-a was performed on ultra-thin cross sections of maize root cells . with anti vha-a pronounced label with gold particles was detected in er membranes , and occasionally a weak labelling of the golgi apparatus . a labelling of tonoplast membranes was not found, indicating that vha-an-term is predominantly located on the er. for comparison, immuno-gold analysis of ultrathin cross sections with anti-vha-a. revealed labelling of the tonoplast  and a labelling of the golgi apparatus significantly stronger than with anti-vha-a .

fluorescence resonance energy transfer between vha-subunits in vivo
fret allows to investigate protein-protein interaction in vitro and in vivo. both partners have to carry fluorescent labels with overlapping emission  and excitation spectra  and need to be situated in close proximity. half maximum energy transfer takes place at distance of the förster radius r <dig>  cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins constitute such a fret pair and were fused to the c-termini of various subunits of v-atpase. under the assumption of freely rotating fluorophores, r <dig> is close to  <dig> nm. the size of the v-atpase complex is about  <dig> nm  ×  <dig> nm . arabidopsis protoplasts were co-transformed with vector constructs of vha-a fused to yfp and vha-c fused to cfp under the control of the 35s promotor. upon excitation of doubly labelled protoplasts at  <dig> nm both, cfp and yfp showed strong fluorescence . fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a double dichroic mirror which exhibits high reflectivity at ~ <dig> nm. therefore, the two emission maxima were separated by a minimum . this fact renders the quantitative analysis of the fret efficiency due to the decrease in donor and increase in acceptor fluorescence more difficult. alternatively, the method of acceptor bleaching can be used to verify energy transfer  <cit>  and can be seen in fig. 7b, the fluorescence intensity of yfp decreased rapidly within  <dig> scan cycles upon excitation at  <dig> nm due to photobleaching to a residual intensity attributable to auto-fluorescence. simultaneously, the donor fluorescence increased substantially, thus providing direct evidence for energy transfer from cfp to yfp. from the increase in cfp fluorescence upon acceptor bleaching an overall fret efficiency of ~ <dig>  is estimated. assuming freely rotating fluorophores  this corresponds to a distance between vha-a, and vha-c of ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  nm . here it has to be pointed out that each ring of the rotor v <dig> contains  <dig> vha-c-subunits and one vha-c"-subunit. hence, dependent on the position of the vha-c/cfp-subunits in the ring different distances between cfp-labelled vha-c subunits and the yfp-labelled vha-a subunit will result.

similar experiments were performed with onion epidermis cells  co-transformed with vha-a/yfp and vha-b/cfp, and vha-b/cfp and vha-h/yfp, respectively. this system was employed for two reasons,  to confirm and extent the results from protoplasts and  to work in turgescent cells, not previously subjected to a protoplast isolation stress. emission spectra were recorded before and after photobleaching of acceptor. decreases in acceptor and increases in donor fluorescence intensities, respectively, were smaller for these pairs of vha-fusions than for vha-a-yfp and vha-c-cfp . nevertheless there was significant fret in the case of vha-a/yfp and vha-b/cfp and some indication of fret in the case of vha-b/cfp and vha-h/yfp, whereas the co-transformed pair of vha-a/cfp and vha-h/yfp gave no fret. it should be noted that in addition to the highly expressed fusion proteins, untagged endogenous subunits still are present in the cell. under such condition, formation of partial subcomplexes with possibly varied fret properties may not be ruled out.

discussion
the set of subunits that assemble plant v-atpase has recently been completed by similarity searches in plant genomic and est sequences using information on yeast vma and other orthologues  <cit> . the presence of a subunit of about  <dig> kda in the functionally active plant vacuolar atpase has been under discussion for a long time  <cit> . here, for the first time, a cdna coding for a plant vha-a was cloned and characterised. mcvha-a as well as the homologous arabidopsis gene products contain all charged amino acids that have been shown to be essential for proton-translocation at conserved positions in the membrane spanning region of the c-terminus . additional evidence for an essential function of vha-a in v-atpase was first obtained for v-atpase of bos bovis. the specific v-atpase-inhibitor bafilomycin  <cit>  was shown to bind to the  <dig> kda vha-a subunit and not, as previously suggested to the proteolipid vha-c. the results were confirmed for all tested species  <cit> . bafilomycin also is a potent inhibitor of plant v-atpase and is routinely used to distinguish v-atpase-dependent atp hydrolysis from background activity  <cit> . in  <dig>  li and sze  <cit>  detected two unknown polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda in purified catalytically active v-atpase but no polypeptide with a molecular mass of about  <dig> kda. the authors hypothesized that plant v-atpase is active in the absence of the  <dig> kda subunit. another explanation for this observation could be the sensitivity of vha-a to degradation through proteases  <cit> , and the detected unknown polypeptides could result from limited proteolysis of vha-a, producing subunit-fragments still capable of transporting protons. the immunoblots with soluble fractions and membrane-preparations of m. crystallinum  incubated with anti vha-an-term support this hypothesis. the  <dig> kda fragment in the cytoplasmic fraction is likely to derive from a proteolytic processing, releasing the soluble portion of mcvha-a. accordingly, high nacl concentration in the purification medium could inhibit involved proteases. the hypthesis is supported by the experiment with protease inhibitor cocktail, where the  <dig> kda subunit was detected as band with intermediate intensity, although only among other bands that were immuno-responsive to anti-vha-a antibody. thus even the protease inhibitors could not fully suppress proteolysis. immunoprecipitation with the antibodies anti vha-an-term and anti vha-amemb further proved that both the n-terminal hyrophilic portion and the membrane sector of vha-a are associated with a complete v-atpase complex.

in plants, immuno-cytochemical examinations of the subcellular localisation of single subunits or holocomplexes  have previously indicated a distribution of v-atpase among nearly all endomembranes of the secretory pathway including the plasmalemma  <cit> ,  <cit> . these findings were supported by measurement of bafilomycin-sensitive atpase activity in selectively purified endomembranes of plants  <cit> .

in our examination the antisera against vha-a and -e showed a staining of the tonoplast and to a lesser extent also of the er and golgi-apparatus . vha-a and e are part of the cytoplasmically exposed v1-structure of v-atpase. the presence of both subunits on all these membranes shows the presence of fully assembled v-atpase.

the presence of the active v-atpase in plants is not only necessary at the tonoplast, since matsuoka et al.  <cit>  could show that the activity of the vacuolar atpase on the er and the ga is necessary for correct targeting of soluble storage proteins to the vacuole. the presence of active v-atpase on the prevacuolar compartment was concluded from the acid ph-optimum of enzymes involved in vacuolar transport, for example the activity of the vacuolar sorting receptor bp- <dig> whose action is strictly ph dependent  <cit> . for this reason a similar staining pattern of all used anti-vha antisera would have been anticipated, but our results showed distinct staining patterns of anti-vha-a and -e on the one hand and anti-vha-an-term on the other hand. immuno-labelling indicates that vha-an-term antiserum exclusively labels the er with some rare association on golgi stacks. these results are surprising since the sequence features of mcvha-a suggest an essential involvement of vha-a in proton transport. a possible explanation might be the presence of three different isoforms in a. thaliana and o. sativa which all share the localisation of the charged amino acids responsible for proton-translocation . based on our results, we suggest that the isoform of vha-a recognised by anti vha a-nterm  is exclusively associated with v-atpase localised on the er. the hypothesis of a compartment-specific localisation of vha-a subunits is supported through several findings in plants and yeast. in yeast all known subunits and chaperones of the v-atpase are encoded by one gene. only the  <dig> kda vha-a is encoded by two different isoforms   <cit> . in general the subunit-isogenes of the v-atpase have a very high degree of similarity within each species  <cit> . in a converse manner, the sequences of the vha-a isogenes are very heterogenic in s. cerevisiae and a. thaliana  especially in the cytoplasmic region of the n-terminus  <cit> . a differential localisation was shown for the two yeast isoforms   <cit> . a detailed examination through kawasaki-nishi et al.  <cit>  showed a localisation of vph <dig> on the tonoplast, while stv <dig> was detected on the late golgi-apparatus and the prevacuolar compartment of yeast. by expressing chimeric proteins composed of the n-terminus of stv <dig> and the c-terminus of vph <dig>  and vice versa, the authors were able to show that the n-terminus defines subcellular sorting. following selective enrichment of the differentially localised complexes, both types of v-atpases were shown to differ in their stability of the v0/v1-complex and in their coupling efficiency  <cit> . the n-terminus was responsible for the differential coupling activity, whereas the c-terminus mediated the differential dissociation.

in plants, matsuoka et al.  <cit>  were able to distinguish between two different v-atpase activities through their differential response to the v-atpase inhibitor bafilomycin. these v-atpase activities were localised in distinct membrane fractions of the secretory pathway including the vacuolar compartments. an antibody directed against the v-atpase holoenzyme revealed significant differences in immuno-staining of endomembrane and vacuolar fractions. these and our results on sequence properties of the different plant vha-a isoforms and the intracellular localisation of vha-a support the hypothesis that at least two different v-atpase activities exist in plants, differing in intracellular localisation and sensitivity to bafilomycin. the target of bafilomycin is vha-a  <cit> . thus, both types of v-atpases might be distinguished through the presence of different isoforms of vha-a.

our results from fret analysis also allows to make some structural assignments: from crystal structure of f-atp synthase, the c-termini of subunit β, homologous to vha-a, and subunit α, homologous to vha-b, are located in close vicinity and oriented to the membrane  <cit> . occurrence of fret between vha-a/yfp and vha-b/cfp supports the same structural arrangement in v-atpase. following crystalization of isolated yeast vha-h  <cit> , the structure was fitted in 3d reconstructions of plant v-atpase based on electron microscopic analysis  <cit>  and suggests localization of the c-terminus of vha-h to the head structure in proximity to vha-b. in vivo-fret in protoplasts expressing vha-b/cfp and vha-h-yfp confirms the orientation of the c-termini of vha-b and h in close vicinity. it should be noted that co-expression of other pairs of chimeric donors and acceptors such as vha-e/cfp and vha-c/yfp did not elicit fret after excitation of cfp . the assumed location of the c-terminus of vha-c in the lumen of the endomembrane compartments and the c-terminus of vha-e most likely in the vicinity of the head is in agreement with the negative result, i.e. the absence of fret between vha-e/cfp and vha-c/yfp. the studies exemplify the suitability of fret to analyse structural features of v-atpase in vivo. the efficient but variable fret in cells expressing vha-c/cfp and vha-a/yfp allows two conclusions: first, the c-termini of vha-c and vha-a are likely to be located on the same, i.e. luminal, side of the endomembrane compartments supporting the topological model with nine transmembrane-domains of vha-a in plants as previously suggested for yeast  <cit>  . second, a significant portion of total vha-a is located in the neighbourhood of vha-c. the calculated distance of  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm between donor and acceptor fluorophore corresponds to the diameter of the proteolipid-ring of the rotor, consisting of  <dig> subunits of vha-c and  <dig> vha-c", respectively. the results confirm that vha-a is part of the functional complex and not only involved in v-atpase assembly. more than half , and possibly all v-atpase complexes contain the holopolypeptide of  <dig> kda.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the primary structure of plant vha-a revealed the presence of amino acid residues that are essential for proton pumping in yeast. employing immuno-co-precipitation and fret it could be demonstrated that subunits vha-a and vha-h are part of the v-atpase complex of plants. furtheron it is shown that one distinct vha-a subunit isoform is localized on the er. the study also shows the usefulness of fret to study multisubunit protein structures in vivo and in vitro.
