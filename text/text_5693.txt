BACKGROUND
in recent years, coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus epidermidis have become frequent causes of infections in connection with surgically implanted medical devices  <cit> . in parallel, the appearance of multi-resistant and vancomycin-resistant s. epidermidis strains has increased quickly due to the increasing use of antibiotics in hospitals  <cit> . the primary pathogenicity trait of s. epidermidis has been associated with its ability to form biofilms on surfaces of medical devices, limiting severely the efficacy of many conventional antibiotics, and biofilms may also protect the bacteria against attacks from the host defence system  <cit> . it has also been observed that aminoglycoside antibiotics may trigger biofilm formation in some bacteria  <cit> . there is therefore an urgent need to design novel antibiotics against staphylococcus infections, especially in relation to biofilm development. recently, the complete genome sequences of two s. epidermidis strains, viz. the non-biofilm-forming strain atcc <dig> and the biofilm-forming strain rp62a, have been published  <cit> , bringing about new opportunities to discover potential antimicrobial targets using in silico genome analyses.

two-component system  control proteins, harboring histidine kinase  and response transcription regulator activities, have been uncovered in most bacteria. recently, the tcss have attracted attention due to their potential as novel antibacterial targets, especially those required for regulation of bacterial growth and virulence in pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . one tcs, yycg/yycf, highly conserved and specific to low g+c gram-positive bacteria has been shown to be essential for bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus survival  <cit> . inhibitors of the yycg hk, such as synthetic imidazole and zerumbone derivatives, or aranorosinol b, obtained by screening acetone extracts from  <dig> microbes, have been documented to be effective antibacterial agents against b. subtilis  <cit> . identification of this limited number of yycg inhibitors required laborious biological and chemical experiments, and the side-effects of these compounds on mammalian cells remain unclear. moreover, b. subtilis may not be an optimal model organism to investigate biofilm formation, a process of major importance for the virulence of staphylococci. this prompted us to demonstrate that s. epidermidis possesses a homologous yycg/yycf tcs, and to investigate whether it would be an appropriate target for the design of novel antibacterial agents. as a prerequisite we set up a rapid and convenient procedure for screening novel inhibitors of the yycg/yycf tcs, testing the possible effects of these inhibitors on both planktonic and sessile bacteria, while using the extreme sensitivity of mammalian cells as a control to put aside compounds that would display a non-specific effect on membranes.

upon binding, many small molecules may affect the functions of proteins. functional analysis has been the basis of a variety of experiments, in which synthetic or purified small molecules have been used to probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological processes in which target proteins are involved. this chemistry-based approach has been coined "chemical biology"  <cit> . combinatorial chemistry and in vivo or in vitro high throughput screening  constitute preferred approaches for discovering active compounds against particular protein targets  <cit> . a complementary approach is to use computational methods to identify active compounds  targeting the three-dimensional  structure of the substrate binding pocket of a protein. this in silico approach is called structure-based virtual screening   <cit> .

in the present study, we first identified the homologous yycg/yycf tcs in the genomes of the s. epidermidis atcc <dig> and rp62a strains. next, a 3d structural model of the conserved hatpase_c domain of s. epidermidis yycg hk was constructed by using the homologous modeling approach. subsequently, the sbvs method was used to search for potential yycg inhibitors from the specs chemical lead-compound database. of the  <dig> candidates selected from the database by sbvs, seven compounds were active in inhibiting growth of s. epidermidis on plates or in liquid media. five of these compounds displayed bactericidal effects on both planktonic and biofilm cells of s. epidermidis. except for one, the compounds bound to the yycg protein and inhibited its auto-phosphorylation in vitro. these compounds displayed low cytotoxicity on mammalian cells and were not hemolytic, indicating that they may be good leads to develop new antibiotics against staphylococci infection.

RESULTS
in silico identification of the yycg/yycf tcs in s.epidermidis
based on sequence homology, we identified likely counterparts of the yycg/yycf tcs  in the genomes of s. epidermidis atcc <dig> and rp62a. the sequence of the yycg protein in s. epidermidis is highly homologous to those of s. aureus and b. subtilis . the same is true for the yycf protein . as yycg and yycf are "persistent" proteins in firmicutes  <cit>  we can be confident that their function is preserved in the clade. more importantly, attempts to inactivate the orthologous yycg/yycf genes identified in s. epidermidis  also failed with homologous recombination technology, indicating that this tcs is required for bacterial growth of s. epidermidis . domain analysis indicates that the yycg protein of s. epidermidis contains one transmembrane segment, and several domains identified in other proteins: hamp , pas , hiska, and hatpase_c, all common to bacterial hks  <cit> . moreover, the yycf protein of s. epidermidis possesses a conserved rec domain containing a phosphoacceptor site that may be phosphorylated by yycg, and a trans_reg_c domain, belonging to the ompr-like winged helix-turn-helix dna-binding domains . interestingly, multi-alignment of hatpase_c domain sequences with counterparts of bacteria from the structural protein data bank  showed that the sequences around the atp binding site in most bacteria were similar, showing four conserved important motifs – the n box, g <dig> box, f box and g <dig> box  <cit> . this demonstrated that the atp binding domain of hks is highly conserved in bacteria, suggesting that it may be used as a potential target for antibacterial agents screening  <cit> . comparison of the yycg hatpase_c domain of s. epidermidis with similar domains in the database showed that the most homologous sequence was the similar domain of the e. coli osmosensor envz, a tcs molecule, with 30% sequence identity and 49% conservative replacements . envz was therefore used as a template for modeling the 3d structure of the yycg hatpase_c domain of s. epidermidis.

a 3d model of the yycg hatpase_c domain of s. epidermidis
to search for potential inhibitors of yycg hk by virtual screening, we constructed a 3d model for the yycg hatpase_c domain of s. epidermidis based on the nmr structure of the homologous domain of the e. coli osmosensor envz   <cit> . the resulting model 3d structure is shown in figure  <dig>  the final structure was checked and validated using several programs such as prostat and profile-3d  <cit> . this model superposed well with the nmr structure of the homologous domain of envz, the root-mean-square deviation  for the cα atoms being about  <dig>  . the hatpase_c domain of yycg is thus predicted to fold in a similar way to that in envz, containing five stranded β-sheets and four α-helices, which form a two-layered α/β sandwich structure . the surface shape and the general features of the hatpase_c domain of yycg were further investigated by using the molcad module of sybyl  <dig>   <cit> . the atp binding site consists of two different cavities connected by a gorge-like channel . this structural prediction was used for virtual drug screening, bearing in mind that only further experimental evidence would validate the model.

discovery of potential inhibitors of the s. epidermidis yycg hk by virtual screening
the atp-binding pocket formed by residues within a radius of  <dig> Å around the atp site of the yycg hatpase_c model of s. epidermidis was used as the target site for high throughput virtual screening . in a first step,  <dig>  potential drug-like molecules, constituting an in-house database , were selected from the specs database using the drug-selection filter developed by zheng et al.  <cit> . the specs_ <dig> database was searched for potential binding molecule structures using the program dock <dig>   <cit>  in a primary screening. the most optimal  <dig>  structures were subsequently re-scored using the flexx program  <cit>  and cscore  <cit> , a consensus scoring method that integrates five popular scoring functions. two hundred molecules passed this highly selective filter. finally,  <dig> molecules were manually selected from the latter sample as inhibitor candidates, according to their molecular diversity, their shape complementarity, and their potential for forming hydrogen bonds in the binding pocket of the yycg hatpase_c domain. of those  <dig> candidates,  <dig> compound samples could be purchased from the specs company for further experimental assays.

antimicrobial activities of potential yycg inhibitors in vitro
since the yycg/yycf tcs is essential for growth and survival in b. subtilis and s. aureus  <cit> , its conservation in sequence and in genome organization in s. epidermidis strongly suggests that it is essential in this organism as well. to test this possibility, we explored whether the potential yycg inhibitor candidates obtained by virtual screening could inhibit bacterial growth. at a concentration of  <dig> μm in liquid culture in a first screening procedure, seven out of the  <dig> candidates completely inhibited growth of s. epidermidis. the seven inhibitors belong to four different classes of chemical structures: three thiazolidinone analogs , two benzamide analogs , one furan derivative  and one derivative of pyrimidinone , as shown in figure  <dig> 

subsequently, the minimal inhibitory concentration  values of these  <dig> compounds were determined, using the standard tube-dilution assay . these  <dig> compounds were further shown to have similar mic values when tested against  <dig> clinical isolates of s. epidermidis from different patients in the zhongshan hospital of shanghai, china . compounds 1– <dig> showed similar mic values  on the s. epidermidis non-biofilm-forming strain atcc <dig> and on the biofilm-forming strain rp62a, whereas compound  <dig> was only effective against the non-biofilm-forming strain atcc <dig>  we also investigated their inhibitory effect against other gram-positive pathogenic cocci which possess the homologous yycg/yycf tcs. this experiment showed that compounds  <dig> and  <dig> were effective against s. aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus mutans, compound  <dig> and  <dig> inhibited the growth of s. aureus and s. pyogenes, and compound  <dig> was only active against s. pyogenes. in contrast, none of these compounds were active against gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa at the concentration of  <dig> μm. this is consistent with the absence of a yycg/yycf tcs counterpart in these genomes and, taken together, this is a first observation suggesting that these compounds are not likely to act by trivial interaction with membrane structures. subsequently, we investigated the bactericidal activity of these compounds against s. epidermidis using a standard minimal bactericidal concentration  assay. five compounds  had their mbc values  below the threshold , and no obvious differences were observed between the biofilm-forming strain and non-biofilm-forming strain of s. epidermidis .

killing biofilm cells of s. epidermidis by potential yycg inhibitors
standard mic/mbc assays measure anti-microbial activities on planktonic bacteria, whereas antibiotic resistance is reported to be enhanced up to 1000-fold in the same cells when they develop in biofilms  <cit> . we therefore measured the bactericidal effect of compound  on sessile cells of s. epidermidis. vancomycin, one of the antibiotics usually used in multidrug-resistant staphylococci associated infections  <cit> , was as a comparison . compared with vancomycin, the potential yycg inhibitors  showed better killing efficiencies against 24-hour-old biofilm cells of s. epidermidis at their mbc values, respectively . the best chemical  reduced the cfu of the biofilm cells more than 100-fold . in contrast, vancomycin caused no increased killing of the biofilm cells even when the concentration was increased to  <dig> μg/ml, relative to that of its mbc value of  <dig> μg/ml . in addition, recent data by using confocal laser scanning microscope  also confirmed that these compounds exhibited much better killing effects than vancomycin on cells embedded in mature biofilms of s. epidermidis clinical isolates  was overproduced by using the pet28a plasmid, and purified using the probond™ purification system . the binding affinities of the seven putative yycg inhibitors to the yycg' protein were determined by using surface plasmon resonance  in vitro. six compounds  displayed high binding affinities to the yycg' protein , whereas compound  <dig> only bound very poorly to the yycg' protein. all the  <dig> positive compounds displayed a significant and dose-dependent binding pattern in the spr response. five compounds  showed characteristic square-wave binding curves, indicating that these compounds form unstable complexes with the yycg' protein in a process of fast association and fast dissociation . compound  <dig> displayed a slow association and slow dissociation reaction, forming a relatively stable complex with the yycg' protein . the data were fitted to a steady-state affinity model for compounds 1– <dig> and a kinetic-state model for compound  <dig> using the biacore  <dig> software to evaluate the corresponding binding affinities , as shown in table  <dig>  the kd value of compound  <dig> can not be calculated because of its very poor binding affinity to the yycg' protein.

inhibition of the yycg' protein atpase activity in vitro
the common characteristic of hks is atp-dependent auto-phosphorylation, associated with the conserved hatpase_c domain. we measured the effects of our potential yycg inhibitors on the protein atpase activity by using the kinase-glo™ luminescent kinase assay. firstly, the putative kinase activity of yycg' protein was measured by quantifying the amount of atp remained in solution after reaction. a direct relationship existed between the luminescence measured with the kinase-glo™ reagent and the amount of atp , indicating the sensitivity of this assay is good. after adding purified yycg' protein into the reaction system , the luminescence was decreased in all the groups containing different atp concentrations, compared with parallel groups without yycg' treatment , since the kinase can hydrolyze atp for its auto-phosphorylation. keeping the atp concentration constant , the luminescence was continuously decreased following the amounts of purified yycg' protein increased . the results indicated that the purified yycg' protein possesses the atpase activity in vitro. at a concentration of  <dig> μm, compounds 1– <dig> and  <dig> decreased the atpase activity of  <dig> μg yycg' protein in the presence of  <dig> μm atp by 52% to 86% , indicating that the binding affinities of these compounds to yycg' correlate well with their inhibitory activities of auto-phosphorylation of yycg'. in contrast, compound  <dig>  which binds poorly to the yycg' protein, showed almost no activity against yycg' atpase activity . the concentrations needed to decrease yycg' atpase activity to 50%  by the  <dig> active compounds  were calculated by gradual dilution of these compounds with an invariable concentration of protein  and atp , as shown in table  <dig>  the ic <dig> value of compound  <dig> was above  <dig> μm under the same reaction conditions. as a comparison, the fragment of another hk protein srrb' containing homologous domains with yycg' in s. epidermidis  <cit>  was also expressed and purified to observed the inhibitory effect on protein phosphotylation by these  <dig> potential yycg inhibitors  . at the concentration of  <dig> μm, only compound  <dig> displays much lower inhibitory effect  on srrb' than it does  on yycg', while the other  <dig> compounds have almost no inhibitory effects.

cytotoxicity and hemolysis of the antimicrobial compounds in vitro
while several of the compounds we identified could be used as excellent drug leads, acting on targets that are absent from eukaryotic cells, they still may display toxicity by interfering with unexpected targets. as a step to rule out this possibility we analyzed the cytotoxicity of compounds 1– <dig> on a vero cell line  by using the traditional 3-- <dig> -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide  method . this approach would also provide us a very sensitive assay to draw aside a trivial action of these products on membrane lipid bilayers. remarkably, as shown in table  <dig>  most cc <dig> values were higher than the highest inhibitor concentration used , except in the case of two inhibitors  which had cc <dig> values below  <dig> μm . furthermore, at the concentration of their respective mic values, all these compounds displayed very low  or almost no cytotoxicity . it has been reported that some tcs inhibitors induce hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes, which has hindered the further development and application of these inhibitors  <cit> . this prompted us to analyze the possible membrane damage caused by our potential yycg inhibitors by examining hemolysis of healthy human erythrocytes possibly induced by these compounds. at their mic concentrations, compounds 1– <dig> displayed no apparent hemolysis . this compares well with the effect of conventional antibiotics such as tetracycline and ciprofloxacin . at their  <dig> times mic concentrations, only compound  <dig> showed a little hemolysis , and at the highest concentration , the hemolytic activity of compound  <dig> was increased to ~16% of the zero control.

interaction models of potential yycg inhibitors to the target protein
as potential yycg inhibitors, six compounds  selected by in silico screening bound with high affinity to the yycg' protein and inhibited its atpase activity in vitro. to further investigate the sites of interaction between the compounds and the yycg protein, and to develop a strategy for designing novel inhibitors, models of the interaction of the compounds with the yycg protein were analyzed based on docking simulations.

the surface of the yycg hatpase_c domain shows two significant hydrophobic areas located in the atp-binding pocket. one is placed in the inner small cavity and is composed of residues phe <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig> and ile53; the other is positioned in the front of the outer larger cavity, consisting of residues phe <dig>  thr <dig>  ile <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  and leu <dig> . most of these residues are conserved in bacterial hks. the binding conformations of the inhibitors designed in the present study in the atp-binding pocket of the yycg hatpase_c domain are shown in figure  <dig>  although their structures are diverse, they adopt similar interactions with the conserved domain. according to the interaction models, a four-point pharmacophore can be figured out for describing the binding of the inhibitors : the middle part of each inhibitor has two hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bonding to asn <dig> and lys <dig>  which stabilize each one of the six inhibitor candidates in the binding pocket; the hydrophobic moieties of the inhibitors fit well into the two hydrophobic cavities. noticeably, the binding model revealed that asn <dig> is of prime importance for stabilizing the interactions between the inhibitors and the yycg protein. this is well in agreement with previous biological function studies which demonstrated that the conserved asn <dig> in the n box was necessary for ligand binding in both classes i and ii tcs  <cit> . in contrast, lys <dig> is a residue specific to yycg. our binding models have provided new possibilities for studies of the biological function of lys <dig> in ligand binding and catalysis of yycg . besides those interactions, the hydrophobic area  may bind hydrophobic parts of different compounds and stabilize these in the inner hollow of the pocket. most of these residues are conserved in homologous hks .

discussion
the yycg/yycf tcs is conserved and specific for low g+c gram-positive bacteria such as b. subtilis, s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . this tcs has been shown to be essential in b. subtilis  <cit>  and could not be inactivated by direct mutation in s. aureus  <cit> , and which also occurs in s. epidermidis . moreover, several genes involved in cell-wall biosynthesis and metabolism, such as teichoic acid biosynthesis protein f  <cit> , and cell wall synthesis protein ypfp  <cit>  were predicted to be regulated by this tcs in s. epidermidis based on the presence of a potential yycf consensus dna binding recognition sequence similar to the one described in b. subtilis and s. aureus  <cit> , although this predicted result needs to be further verified . we have therefore explored the possibility of using the yycg hk as a potential target in a screening for new antibiotics.

compared with biological and chemical screening for new antibiotics, the advantage of sbvs technology is the rapid, economical and efficient throughput. furthermore, lead-compound databases provide ample sources for screening, whereas chemical synthesis is time consuming and expensive. as a case in point, the use of lead-compound databases has already led to the discovery of the diarylquinoline lead-compound against mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> .

screening  <dig>  possible compounds in silico we finally retained  <dig>  among which  <dig> were promising candidates as potential yycg hk inhibitors. these  <dig> compounds bound to the yycg protein in vitro and inhibited its atpase activity, while they were also active antimicrobials against s. epidermidis. this does not prove, however, that yycg is the only target when compounds interact with bacteria. in fact, we have found a total of  <dig> putative tcss in the genome of s. epidermidis, including yycg/yycf. because they have many core features in common, we cannot exclude that some of the compounds may also bind to other hks. this would in fact enhance the antibiotic effect of the compounds. to investigate this possibility, we expressed and purified the fragment of another hk of s. epidermidis – srrb , which is involved in the tcs srrb/srra  <cit> . we analyzed the effects of the  <dig> active compounds  on the auto-phosphorylation of this purified protein. we observed that only compound  <dig>  inhibited the auto-phosphorylation of srrb'. the inhibition was approximately 20% lower than that demonstrated here on yycg'  under the same reaction conditions . this suggests that the compounds display a certain degree of specificity dependent on the characteristics of the hatpase_c domain structure in the different hks.

one of the interesting and challenging goals of new searches for anti-microbial compounds is to identify potential drugs which are equally active against planktonic and sessile bacteria . the yycg inhibitor compounds described here were found to have somewhat reduced bactericidal effect on mature biofilms of s. epidermidis. these compounds were, however, much more efficient against sessile bacteria than the commonly used staphylococcus antibiotic, vancomycin. in fact, vancomycin was almost without effect against biofilm cells , as also reported by others  <cit> . this was accounted for in s. aureus by reduced penetration of vancomycin and delay of the exposure of the bacteria in the biofilm deeper layers  <cit> . however, it remains unknown whether the situation is the same with our compounds in s. epidermidis biofilms. interestingly, seventeen compounds among the  <dig> candidates we retained for further studies were active in inhibiting biofilm formation without interfering with bacterial growth. most of them did not bind to the yycg' protein nor inhibit its auto-phosphorylation in vitro, indicating that these compounds are not potential inhibitors of the yycg hk . their targets in s. epidermidis and the mechanisms of inhibiting biofilm formation are still under investigation.

in previous studies, some potential inhibitors of histidine kinase appeared to display trivial side effects, such as membrane disruption, excessive protein binding or limited bioavailability. this prevented their further development  <cit> . in this study, the potential yycg inhibitors displayed low cytotoxicity and low hemolysis to mammalian cells at the effective concentrations we used in vitro. we are now in the process of finding out the more effective derivatives, using those as leads. in future work, an appropriate animal model also needs to be established to investigate the effect of these compounds in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, these novel inhibitors of yycg histidine kinase are considered as promising lead-compounds for developing new reagents against staphylococci infections. furthermore, the structure-based virtual screening  technology can be widely used for discovery of potential bacterial tcss inhibitors in both gram-positive and gram-negative species, even on other "drug target" proteins. and it is more rapid and efficacious than traditional screening technology.
