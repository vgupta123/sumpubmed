BACKGROUND
motile cilia/flagella propel eukaryotic cells in aqueous environment or circulate surrounding fluid. the movement is generated by a microtubule-based biological machine, the axoneme. most axonemes adopt a ‘9 + 2’ format with  <dig> outer microtubule doublets encircling two microtubule singlets. the former associate with outer dynein arms , inner dynein arms  and radial spokes , while the latter and a number of projections constitute the central pair  apparatus. these structures along with other less evident complexes operate in concert to generate the rhythmic beating. and, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  is a key 2nd messenger that regulates the movement. studies with isolated axonemes of various mutants of the oda, ida, rs, cp and pharmacological inhibitors have implicated camp-dependent protein kinase  and other phosphoenzymes in the dynein-driven microtubule sliding . since isolated axonemes - without flagellar membrane and soluble contents - were used in the sliding assay, it was proposed that a network of phosphoenzymes anchored to the axoneme regulate dynein–driven motility .

pka, a holoenzyme of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits, is anchored to scaffold protein; namely, the a-kinase anchoring protein . in  <dig>  akaps were first discovered as high affinity binding partners of the regulatory subunit of pka  <cit> . many more were discovered subsequently from several organisms and cell types by an overlay assay using the rii subunit  <cit> . in general, akaps are scaffold proteins sharing little sequence homology, but usually contain three common features – a region for targeting it to a particular micro-compartment, an amphipathic helix  that binds to a hydrophobic cleft of the dimerization/docking domain  present on the pka regulatory subunits, and additional motifs that recruit an array of molecules involved in signalling such as other protein kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, gsk3ß, and small gtpases  <cit> . this ah which binds to the d/d domain of the regulatory subunit of pka and non-pka proteins serves as a parameter for a protein to be designated as akap. recently, an in silico approach was adopted to determine amphipathic helices containing proteins which could be candidate akaps  <cit> .

consistent with multiple implicated roles of pka in ciliated cells, independent studies used rii overlays to reveal a number of akaps in this organelle, at least  <dig> akaps in the fibrous sheath surrounding the 9 +  <dig> axoneme in mammalian sperms  <cit> , one in cilia of the human respiratory tract  <cit>  and two  in the axoneme of chlamydomonas flagella  <cit> . analysis of flagellar mutants lacking specific axonemal complexes showed that akap <dig> is rsp <dig> in the rs complex, whereas akap <dig> resides in the cp. while this finding is consistent with the role of rs and the cp in regulating dynein motors, rss isolated from chlamydomonas flagella did not contain any pka catalytic subunits  <cit> . nonetheless, rsp <dig> and rs indeed harbour features related to pka and akaps. the n-terminus of rsp <dig> anchors the rs to particular sites in the axoneme. secondly, rsp <dig> forms a homodimer  <cit> , each monomer containing an ah for interacting with rsp <dig> or rsp <dig>  <cit>  that contains a rii domain but lack any features required for camp signalling or phosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, the rs in chlamydomonas flagella appears to utilize pka anchoring mechanism to tether different molecular modules for the function of the rs.

notably, a number of proteins with a rii domain have been discovered in mammalian cilia and flagella  <cit> . in addition, accumulated evidence indicates that rii harbours the d/d domain. in fact, two conserved rs proteins contain what is known as the dpy <dig> domain that share a similar secondary and tertiary structure with the rii domain and bind amphipathic helices of akaps  <cit> . another akap interactor, viz. myc-binding protein- <dig>  was found to bind to the ah. myc and mycbp- <dig> complex acts as a transcriptional regulator, enhancing the transcription of genes controlled by the e-box element and leading to erythrocyte differentiation  <cit> . it was proposed that mycbp- <dig>  pka and akap <dig> form a ternary complex in the nucleus negatively regulating the kinase activity  <cit> . mycbp- <dig> operates outside the nucleus as well, especially during the interphase. it was shown that mycbp- <dig> interacts with a few akaps, such as akap <dig> in sperm mitochondria, its splice variant s-akap <dig>  <cit> , and big <dig>  an akap in the trans-golgi network  <cit> . here, we show that fap <dig> in chlamydomonas flagella behaves like mycbp- <dig> in associating with an akap, viz. akap <dig> in the c <dig> microtubule.

RESULTS
fap <dig> in chlamydomonas is an mycbp- <dig> homologue predicted to form a rii-like domain at the n-terminus
several studies have shown that mycbp- <dig> is an akap interactor . blast search with the human mycbp- <dig> revealed a single homologue, fap <dig> in the chlamydomonas flagellar proteome and its presence in other non-ciliated organisms such as angiosperms. phylogenetic analysis with representative mycbp-1-like proteins from several organisms generated using mega <dig>  <cit>  showed that fap <dig> forms a cluster with the proteins from volvox and protozoans . it also appears to have branched from the mammalian lineage of mycbp- <dig>  sequence alignment using clustal omega  <cit>  of fap <dig> and mycbp- <dig> from a few species of plants, animals, fungi and protozoans revealed substantial sequence identity or similarity  in the n-terminal region . this region also shares a.a. of similar properties with proteins containing the d/d domain similar to that of rii and dpy- <dig> . homology detection and secondary structure analysis revealed high sequence similarity with the n-terminus that spanned the helix-turn-helix fold typical to the rii clan of proteins . this was done using hhpred  <cit> . the sequences with the riia d/d domain and dpy- <dig> domains that showed significant match were aligned using multiple sequence alignment software , . from secondary structure prediction of fap <dig>  it appears that c-terminus is a helix with a strong propensity to form a coiled-coil, known for protein-protein interaction. therefore, we speculate that fap <dig> has two molecular modules, one for binding an ah and one for partnering with proteins .fig.  <dig> fap <dig> harbours a rii-like fold  a blast of fap <dig> was carried out and representative mycbp-1-like sequences from species of plants, animals, algae and protozoans were selected and a phylogenetic tree was generated using mega <dig>  organisms and their accession numbers used for this exercise are c. reinhardtii acr <dig>  v. carterii xp_ <dig> , b. rapa np_ <dig> , a. thaliana np_ <dig> , c. arabica ady <dig> , c. sativus xp_ <dig> , o. sativa eec <dig> , s. bicolor xp_ <dig> , s. lycopersicon xp_ <dig> , p. sitchensis abr <dig> , a. mellifera xp_ <dig> , s. kowaleskii xp_ <dig> , x. tropicalis np_ <dig> , m. domestica xp_ <dig> , p. troglodytes xp_ <dig> , m. mulatta xp_ <dig> , h. sapiens baa <dig> , p. tetraaurelia xp_ <dig> , t. cruzi xp_ <dig> , p. sojae xp_ <dig> , a. anophagefferens xp_ <dig> , e. siliculosus cbn <dig>  and t. gondii xp_ <dig> .  alignment of representative sequences from those used for the phylogenetic analysis. the sequence homology is the highest at the n-terminal region that is predicted to fold into a helix-loop-helix structure as expected of dimerization and docking domains. the c-terminus of fap <dig> shows a propensity to form coiled-coils. identical residues are shaded, arrows represent the helix-forming residues and the lines represent coiled-coil forming residues.  multiple alignment of fap <dig> with proteins contianing the d/d domain using the best matches from hhpred. . the sequences with the riia d/d domain and dpy- <dig> domains that showed significant match were aligned using multiple sequence alignment software . identical regions are shaded



localization of fap174
the c. reinhardtii flagella contain two akaps; one localized to the rs and the other to the cp  <cit> , . to determine whether fap <dig> is interacting with the akap in the rs or cp, we over-expressed 6his-fap <dig> in e. coli. the freshly purified recombinant protein migrated as ~12 kda monomers in sds-page; after storage at −20 °c, it appeared as monomers and stable dimers. the purified protein was used to raise rabbit anti-6his-fap <dig> polyclonal antibody. the affinity-purified antibodies were used for probing flagella of wt and representative mutant strains lacking specific axonemal structures. western blot analysis of axonemes showed that the antibody recognized a single ~10 kda protein as expected of native fap <dig> in wt axonemes . the band was present in pf <dig> lacking the rs and pf <dig> that is deficient in the c <dig> microtubule, but normal in the c <dig> of the cp apparatus. however, fap <dig> is either absent or less abundant in pf <dig>  pf <dig>  pf <dig> and pf <dig> mutants that lacks the entire cp apparatus or is partially defective . this suggests that fap <dig> is present in the c <dig> microtubule or the associated projections.fig.  <dig> the radial spoke and central pair akaps. schematics depicting the two akaps in the 9 +  <dig> axoneme. akap <dig> is rsp <dig> proposed to be a scaffold protein binding to radial spoke proteins  with rii and dpy <dig> domains. the identity and partners of akap <dig> in c <dig> of the central pair apparatus remain elusive. this study attempts to identify these interactors. only part of the 9 +  <dig> axoneme cross section is illustrated. also note, that the entire rsp harbours  <dig> different proteins; however, the figure depicts molecules significant for the current study

for immunofluorescence imaging, whole cells and the isolated nucleo-flagellar-apparatus  were incubated with affinity-purified anti-6his-fap <dig> antibody and mouse anti-acetylated tubulin antibody. as compared to the pre-immune serum control , both, anti-acetylated tubulin  and anti-fap <dig>  decorated the entire flagella, the basal bodies of wt cells and nfa . notably, two pairs of spots are particularly prominent at the flagellar base. consistent with the western blot, anti-6his-fap <dig> did not decorate mutant pf <dig> flagella lacking the cp; but, still revealed the bright spots at the flagellar base . taken together, these observations suggest the localization of fap <dig> in the c <dig> part of the cp as akap <dig>  the localization near the basal body and transition zone  could be the protein being transported to the flagella. in cells with less intense autofluorescence from plastids, fap <dig> was also evident around the nucleus  as reported previously for mycbp- <dig>  <cit> .

in vitro interaction of fap <dig> with the flagellar akaps
we tested whether fap <dig>  like rii, can bind to flagellar akaps in overlay and in vitro 6his pull-down assays. the recombinant 6his-fap <dig> and gst-tagged rsp <dig> were co-expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  . as a control, a clone co-expressing gst with fap <dig> was generated. it was found that 6his-fap <dig> pulled down gst-rsp <dig> and another polypeptide  of a similar molecular weight that was also seen in the gst tag control . this suggested that the full-length gst-rsp <dig> did not interact with fap <dig> under the current assay conditions. this led us to test the interaction of fap <dig> with the rii-binding ah in rsp <dig>  we generated bacterial strains co-expressing 6his-fap <dig> and the ah  of rsp <dig>  henceforth referred to as gst-rsp <dig> ah. since low co-expression hindered the experiment, individual fusion proteins were purified . 6his-fap <dig> pulled down the gst-rsp <dig> ah with a low stoichiometry; but, not the gst tag . as a control, we tested the interaction between gst-rsp <dig> ah and a non-relevant 6his-tagged recombinant protein  from chlamydomonas reinhardtii . with no interaction observed for the negative control , we found that fap <dig> has rather weak affinity to the ah in rsp <dig> fig.  <dig> interaction of fap <dig> with gst-rsp3-ah 96– <dig> in vitro.  purified proteins used for the assay.   negative control for the assay, which depicts no interaction between arl <dig> and gst-rsp <dig> ah.  co-purification of fap <dig> with gst or gst-rsp3-ah 96– <dig>  testing the in vitro interaction of the gst-rsp3-ah 96– <dig> with 6his-fap <dig> protein. note the rather weak interaction as evidenced in the last lane 



it may be emphasized that an akap <dig> pull-down assay was not possible, since the akap <dig> gene and protein have not yet been identified. therefore, we used an overlay assay to test the interaction of 6his-fap <dig> and akap <dig> in the axonemes from wt, rs and cp mutants . as compared with the only anti-his antibody control , rii overlays on axonemal blots revealed a band corresponding to akap <dig> in the wt, pf <dig> and partially defective pf <dig> cp mutant . in our gels, akap <dig> migrated near 260 kda. this polypeptide was clearly absent in pf <dig>  pf <dig> and pf <dig> axonemes that lack the entire cp apparatus. on the other hand, the band corresponding to rsp <dig> was seen in all the axonemes; except pf <dig>  like rii proteins, 6his-fap <dig> in the overlay  binds to the expected ~240 kda molecule in only wt and pf <dig> axonemes. interestingly, though, unlike riia , 6his-fap <dig> did not evidently bind to rsp <dig> in the overlay, consistent with the low stoichiometry co-purification of fap <dig> and rsp <dig> . the additional two unknown polypeptides of ~ <dig> and 125 kda whose identity remains elusive were also detected in 6his-fap <dig> overlay .fig.  <dig> the recognition of akap <dig> by recombinant fap <dig> and rii in vitro.  the blots were probed with recombinant 6his-tagged riia d/d protein and revealed by hrp-conjugated anti-his antibody. the polypeptide migrated above 250 kda in the axonemes of wt, pf <dig> and pf <dig> but were absent in mutants lacking the central pair, as expected of akap <dig>   6his-fap <dig> overlays also show the same band above 250 kda. 6his-fap <dig> also reacted with two other proteins. the polypeptide migrated above 250 kda in the axonemes of wt, pf <dig> and pf <dig> but were absent in mutants lacking the central pair.  control overlay blots with wt and mutant axonemes were probed with the anti-his antibody coupled to hrp without the interacting proteins



discussion
mycbp- <dig> was found to bind akaps in a few organelles, including the akaps in flagellar structures that are unique to sperms  <cit> . the current work demonstrates that the mycbp- <dig> orthologue, fap <dig>  binds to akap <dig> in the axoneme of chlamydomonas flagella. the findings expand the roles of rii-like domain in protein complex assembly and reveal new insight in the composition of the cp apparatus.

independent lines of evidence indicate that fap <dig> is a conserved structural component in a novel molecular complex in the c <dig> part of cp apparatus. it was first identified in chlamydomonas flagella proteome project  <cit> . western blots using the fap <dig> specific antibodies showed that it is absent in mutant axonemes missing the c <dig> microtubule of the cp ; but, is retained in the mutant axonemes missing the c <dig> fraction . while pf <dig> mutant which also shows reduced amounts of fap <dig> is considered cp minus, its axoneme often contains an electron-dense core in the place of the cp  <cit> . it has been demonstrated recently that selective cp proteins remain in the core of cp mutants  <cit> . the absence of rs, on the other hand, does not affect the assembly of fap <dig> . consistent with this, immunofluorescence microscopy show anti-fap <dig> decorated the entire flagella of wt but not a cp mutant. likewise, overlays showed that fap <dig> and riia  recognize a 260 kda polypeptide in the axonemes of wt corresponding to akap <dig> present in the c <dig> microtubule and no band corresponding to the 97 kda rsp <dig> polypeptide. the latter result and its localization only to the central pair suggest that fap <dig> is not a physiological interactor of rsp <dig> 

mycbp- <dig> was initially identified in the nucleus and the surrounding membranous networks for assisting c-myc trafficking between the compartments. it also forms a ternary complex with akaps and mycbpap in the nucleus. it seems that mycbp- <dig> uses its rii-like domain to associate with akaps and its coiled-coil region to bind c-myc and mycbpap. as far as the presence of fap <dig> in basal body or tz is concerned, the fluorescent signal could be indication of protein carried to these locations. another interesting scenario could be there are additional akaps in the tz or basal bodies anchoring fap <dig> and are yet to be determined. consistent with this notion, akap <dig> is present in the proteome of the human and fly centrosome  <cit> . in this regard, fap <dig> is rather versatile as proteins that contain the d/d domain  is involved in the assembly of several molecular complexes in distinct cellular compartments or organisms. to this extent, it would be very interesting to know the exact sub-flagellar localization of fap174-akap <dig> complex and the molecular identity of akap <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the current study has identified a mycbp- <dig> like protein with d/d like domain localized in the central pair of the chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella. similar to its mammalian equivalent, the d/d domain facilitates its binding to akaps. the study further adds fap <dig> as a new protein to the c <dig> microtubule protein complexes. our further efforts are to characterize this akap-fap <dig> complex, find the molecular identity of akap <dig> and explore the role of this complex in the motility of the 9 +  <dig> cilia.
