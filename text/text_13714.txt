BACKGROUND
oocytes have the unique ability to remodel the chromatin of the germinal nuclei into a totipotent state. these modifications are particularly striking for the male pro-nuclei: upon fertilization, the sperm chromatin packaging protamines are stripped off and replaced by histones, the dna is demethylated within  <dig> hours of fertilization, and the amino terminal tails of histones are modified including methylation of arginin  <dig> and phosphorylation of serin  <dig> of histone h <dig>   <cit> . remarkably, the reprogramming properties of oocytes are not restricted to the very specialized germinal nuclei. indisputably, the cloning of dolly has shown that the oocyte cytoplasm is able to extensively reverse the chromatin modifications associated with a differentiated state  <cit> . somatic cell nuclear transplantation  has since been extended to other species, including human cells, and to many cell types, including terminally differentiated cells such as granulocytes  <cit> . thus differentiation is not anymore considered as an irreversible process, but rather as modifications of the cellular epigenome and transcriptome, that are amenable to complete reversal. in addition to oocytes, other cell types can reprogram somatic cells towards pluripotency. for example, using cell fusion strategies, it has been shown that hybrid cell clones obtained by fusion of a differentiated cell with either teratocarcinoma cells or embryonic stem cells display features of pluripotent, undifferentiated cells with concomitant loss of the markers associated with differentiation  <cit> . more recently, and quite unexpectedly, takahashi and yamanaka have shown that the expression of only four selected transcription factors, oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  cmyc and klf <dig>  is sufficient to drive a mouse fibroblast into an induced pluripotent stem cell  with all the features of embryonic stem cells, including a high growth rate and the ability to form a variety of tissues from all three germ layers in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . these results have been confirmed by other studies, extended to human cells, and applied to non-fibroblastic cells such as mesenchymal stem cells , gastric epithelial cells or hepatocytes  <cit> . at the center of cellular reprogramming lies the activation of the pluripotency transcriptional regulatory circuitry involving pou5f1/oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  <cit>  and extensive chromatin-remodeling. however, the details of this process, such as the exact mediators of the chromatin modifications, remain ill defined. data from xenopus egg experiments point to nucleosomal atpases, but these findings await confirmation using mammalian oocytes  <cit> .

as oocytes and es cells are two cell types able to reprogram a somatic cell such as fibroblasts into pluripotent cells, the comparison of the gene expression program of these two cell types could contribute to the understanding of these cell reprogramming properties. therefore, we generated a transcriptome compendium of  <dig> samples by collecting public microarray data and compared the gene expression profile of oocytes and hesc to that of somatic tissues. we defined a common oocyte/hesc signature, which comprised many cell cycle genes, but also several biological pathways not associated with cell growth. strikingly, a large set of genes is coding for genes involved in protein ubiquitination and the proteasome pathway. upon hesc differentiation into embryoid bodies, the transcription of this pathway declines. in agreement with this preferential expression in pluripotent cells, we observed a selective sensitivity of hesc to the pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome activity, suggesting a role for this machinery in the maintenance of pluripotency.

RESULTS
human oocytes and hesc share a common transcriptome signature
to identify a gene expression signature shared by mature oocytes and hesc but not by somatic cells, we confronted  <dig> oocyte and  <dig> hesc expression profiles to a transcriptome collection of  <dig> samples spanning a wide variety of fetal and adult somatic cell samples . this microarray compendium quantified the expression of  <dig>  <dig> unique refseq transcripts in a total of  <dig> samples . a non-supervised analysis using principal component analysis  mapped the samples in a two dimensional space with a differentiation gradient ranging from undifferentiated hesc samples to highly specialized tissues such as hematopoietic cell samples or nervous system tissue samples . the hesc samples grouped together very tightly, even though the transcriptomes were obtained from six different studies and included  <dig> different hesc cell lines, in agreement with the low variation between hesc cell lines  <cit>  and the robustness of the affymetrix microarrays  <cit> . strikingly, the human mature oocyte samples were situated in the vicinity of the hesc samples, distantly located from most somatic tissues samples. a hierarchical clustering confirmed these findings, showing that mii oocytes and hesc clustered together, sharing a signature of overexpressed genes, demonstrating a close gene expression . we computed an oocyte and a hesc signature by comparing each of these two categories to somatic cells. using significance analysis of microarrays  software with a false discovery rated  of  <dig> % and a ratio between groups of at least  <dig>  we determined that oocytes overexpressed  <dig> probesets   compared to somatic samples, whereas hesc overexpressed  <dig> ps  . the "oocytes signature" comprised dazl, sox <dig>  zp <dig>  gdf <dig>  aurkc, pttg <dig>  etc.  which have previously been identified as overexpressed by female germinal cells by our group and others  <cit> . similarly, the "hesc signature" displayed numerous genes known to be specifically overexpressed in hesc such as pou5f1/oct <dig>  nanog, dppa <dig>  tdgf <dig>  cd <dig>  podxl, hells, etc.  <cit> . these findings validated the biological relevance of our compendium and the signatures specific to oocytes and hesc. we intersected these two lists of genes and established a "oocyte/hesc signature", composed of  <dig> ps  .

a summary of the microarray samples used in this study 

a strong cell cycle signature
to get an insight into the oocyte/hesc signature, we searched for overrepresented gene ontology  functional annotations. as expected from our previous studies on oocytes transcriptome or hesc transcriptome  <cit> , the oocytes/hesc signature was highly enriched in genes associated with intra-cellular localization, dna and rna binding, and conversely, it was significantly depleted in genes which encode for secreted proteins or proteins implicated in signal transduction . remarkably, we observed that the biological process annotations related to cell cycle such as "mitotic cell cycle", "cell cycle progress", "nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide synthesis" were among the most highly enriched in the oocyte/hesc signature . these findings were in line with the very short cell cycle duration of primate esc  <cit>  and with the fact that mii oocytes samples are pure populations of cells undergoing the second meiotic division, which has many features of mitosis. thus, these two tissue types highly express genes involved in the process of cell division. to delineate more clearly the cell cycle contribution to the oocyte/hesc signature, we defined a cell cycle signature independently from the oocytes and hesc samples. we compared samples characterized by a high proliferation index to our somatic samples series. proliferating samples included normal cells such as rapidly dividing cd71+ early erythroid progenitors and cd105+ endothelial cells, as well as cell lines originating from haematological, hepatic, breast and colorectal tumors . a sam analysis with a fdr of  <dig> % identified  <dig> ps  overexpressed in proliferating somatic samples, composing a "cell cycle signature". intersection with the oocyte/hesc signatures revealed that  <dig> ps  were shared with the cell cycle signature . this cell cycle part of the oocytes/hesc signature included enzymes involved in general cell metabolism , nucleoside synthesis , dna repair including mismatch repair  or base excision repair , main components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery , regulator of the topologic state of dna  and components of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint  . however, it must be noted that  <dig> genes from the oocyte/hesc signature that are functionally annotated "cell cycle" by gene ontology were not included in the cell cycle signature. these are cell cycle genes that are preferentially expressed in mature oocytes and hesc as compared to other cycling cell types such as malignant cell lines or proliferating primary hematopoietic cells, and included the spindle checkpoint gene chek <dig>  fbxo5/emi <dig>  the cyclin dependent kinase-activating kinase cdk <dig> and a component of transcription factor iih, cdk <dig> 

human oocytes and hesc share a large chromatin remodelling network
we focused the second part of our analysis on the non-cell cycle part of the oocyte/hesc signature. removing the  <dig> cell cycles ps led to the definition of a "non-cell cycle oocyte/hesc signature" that retained  <dig> ps . this signature contained many transcripts involved in dna and histone modifications. one of these transcripts was dnmt3b, involved in dna methylation. the high fold change of dnmt3b in hesc and oocytes compared to somatic samples  suggests a central role of this dna methyltransferase in the control of the epigenome of these cells. in addition, several transcripts, comprising jarid <dig>  smarca <dig>  cbx <dig>  chaf1a and cbx <dig>  were involved in histone modification processes . we selected two chromatin remodelling genes, dnmt3b and smarca <dig>  and validated by qrt-pcr their preferential expression in oocytes and hesc compared to somatic samples .

zinc finger genes
mature mii oocytes and hesc overexpressed numerous zinc finger domain genes. the zinc finger motif is a dna binding domain dependent on a zinc ion, frequently found in transcription factors. the non-cell cycle oocyte/hesc signature was significantly enriched in zinc finger ps :  <dig>  out of  <dig> ps  in the signature compared to  <dig> out of  <dig> ps  in the complete list of ps  . the expression bar charts for the zinc finger domain gene znf <dig> is shown in figure 1c and that of all  <dig> zinc finger domain genes from the non-cell cycle oocyte/hesc list is available as additional file  <dig>

ubiquitination and proteasome
surprisingly, we found that a highly significant proportion of genes of the non-cycle oocytes/hesc signature was involved in the protein ubiquitination and proteasome canonical pathway  . enzymes from the three e1/e2/e <dig> ubiquitination classes were found significantly overexpressed in the functional regulatory network: the e <dig> ubiquitin-activating enzyme ube1c, the e <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes ube2g <dig>  ube2v <dig> and ube2v <dig>  and the e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligases ube3b and breast cancer  <dig>  early onset  . it was recently showed that brca <dig> is part of a holoenzyme complex containing brca <dig>  brca <dig>  bard <dig> and rad <dig> which is called the brca1- and brca2-containing complex  that displays an ubiquitin e <dig> ligase activity  <cit> . we found that three out of the four components of brcc, namely bard <dig>  brca <dig> and rad <dig> are overexpressed in mii oocytes and hesc whereas brca <dig> is simply expressed. one key consequence of protein ubiquitination is to target proteins for degradation by the 26s proteasome. in line with the biased high expression of ubiquitination pathway components, we also found many subunits of the proteasome significantly overexpressed in mii oocytes and hesc . as expected for a ubiquitous cell machinery complex, the expression of most subunits of the 26s proteasome is detected by microarrays in oocytes and hesc. among these, four catalytic alpha proteasome subunits  and three regulatory subunits, the atpase psmc <dig> and the non-atpase psmd <dig> and psmd <dig>  are significantly upregulated in mii oocytes and hesc as compared to somatic tissues  , in line with the overexpression of the ubiquitin pathway. in addition, three ubiquitin-specific proteases , that are deubiquitinating enzymes, were also found highly expressed in the oocytes and hesc. remarkably, microarray analysis showed that upon differentiation, the expression level of proteasome components that are overexpressed in hesc decreased to a level similar to that of somatic cells .

high sensitivity of human embryonic stem cells to proteasome inhibition
the high expression level of the proteasome machinery in hesc and its decrease during hesc differentiation suggested that this pathway could play an important role in pluripotent cells. to determine the consequence of functional blocking of the proteasome activity in hesc, we tested the effect of mg <dig>  a specific proteasome inhibitor, on embryonic stem cells  <cit> . increasing doses of mg <dig> were added to the culture media of hs <dig> hes cells. at  <dig> nm the morphology of the hesc colonies clearly showed large patches of differentiation and at  <dig> nm no undifferentiated cells remained . furthermore, when colonies contained mixed populations of undifferentiated and differentiated cells,  <dig> μm of mg <dig> induced the detachment of the undifferentiated cells whereas the differentiated progeny stayed tightly sticked to the dish. these results were reproduced on two other hes cell lines . by contrast, the morphology and adhesion of human foreskin fibroblasts  were not altered by mg <dig> at concentration up to  <dig> μm . moreover, we differentiated the hd <dig> and hs <dig> hesc into hes-differentiated fibroblasts  that display features characteristic of fibroblasts: flattened cells with elongated nucleus and branching pseudopodia, expression of membrane markers such as p4h, cd <dig> or cd <dig>  treatment with mg <dig> did not induce changes in cell morphology of the hes-df-hd <dig>  and hes-df-hs <dig> , even at high concentrations. rt-pcr analysis showed that expression of pluripotency markers decreased when hesc were treated with mg <dig>  whereas the expression of pou5f1/oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog decreased with the proteasome treatment, gapdh expression was not modified . this effect was also substantiated by flow cytometry. we observed decreasing expression of the pluripotency marker tra-1- <dig> on hs <dig> hesc after exposition to mg <dig> . however, high concentration of mg <dig>  up to  <dig> μm, did not affect two different fibroblasts cell surface markers, cd <dig> and cd <dig> on hff, on hes-df-hs <dig> or on hes-df-hd <dig>  thus, our results showed that pluripotent hesc are highly susceptible to the action of proteasome blockage, whereas somatic cells such as hff or the differentiated progeny of hesc such as hes-df were not affected.

discussion
early human embryo development results in the reprogramming of highly specialized germinal cells into totipotent and then pluripotent cells that are the progenitors of all the specialized cell types of the human body. this unique biological property has been harnessed to restore pluripotency in human somatic cells by scnt or cell-fusion using embryonic stem cells  <cit> . hesc share with pluripotent stem cells from the inner cell mass pluripotency transcription factors and multi-lineage differentiation properties, and are considered a good in vitro model for pre-embryo pluripotent stem cells. though human oocytes and esc are developmentally separated by less than one week, the transcriptome of the oocyte undergoes rapid changes after fertilization  <cit> . we undertook to find out a common expression signature to these two cell types, that share somatic cell reprogramming properties, by comparing them to a large collection of somatic tissues samples. a first observation was that the oocytes/hesc signature was highly enriched in genes involved in cell cycle. whereas this was expected because of the cell cycle status of these two cell types, the expression of a large set of genes associated with cell division is nevertheless of interest for cellular reprogramming. as recently reported, prior mitotic remodeling of the somatic nuclei, involving topoisomerase ii -dependent shortening of chromatin loop domains and an increased recruitment of replication initiation factors onto chromatin, is essential for reprogramming of differentiated nuclei  <cit> . strikingly, we found that top2a was highly up-regulated in both oocytes and hesc. this observation suggests that top2a could be a major factor in the reprogramming properties of oocytes and hesc by participating in chromatin remodeling. conversely, the identification of a "cell cycle signature", shared with highly proliferating tissues such as cancer cell lines, provided a mean to identify by subtraction a "non-cycle oocytes/hesc" signature of  <dig> ps. this signature included transcripts coding for proteins involved in chromatin structure modifications such as dnmt3b, jarid <dig>  smarca <dig> or cbx <dig> that contribute to the dna methylation and chromatin remodeling . consistent with these observations, hesc display a distinct, permissive, chromatin structure compared with other tissues  <cit> . expression of dna methyl-transferases or several atp-dependent chromatin remodelling factors are elevated in murine oocytes or es cells  <cit> . thus our findings show large similarities between murine and human es cells, and put forward several genes whose strong overexpression could contribute to the specific chromatin state of hesc.

another lesson from our transcriptomic approach is that the common oocytes/hesc gene expression profile has a very low number of genes that are either secreted or membrane bound . this is in line with our previously published data that booth oocytes and hesc "specific genes" are significantly depleted in extracellular signalling components, suggesting that this feature is indeed a common characteristic shared by oocytes and hesc and is not simply due to a lack of overlap  <cit> . hence, genes specifically shared by oocytes and hesc are largely nuclear proteins. one assumption that can be inferred from these findings is that determinant of pluripotency may be mostly intrinsic factors. this observation converges on a recent model, which proposed that pluripotency is a ground state that is intrinsically self-maintained when protected from extrinsic differentiation stimuli  <cit> .

an unexpected observation was that genes involved in protein ubiquitination and proteasome pathway were also overrepresented in the oocytes/hesc signature. this could be linked to the strong proliferation signature of hesc and oocytes as this pathway is by many way implicated in the regulating the cell cycle  <cit> . however, the overexpression of the ubiquitination/proteasome pathway was still significant when the cell cycle signature was substracted, suggesting that this pathway could have a role in pluripotent cells in addition to its house keeping or cell cycle functions. in line with these results, we showed a selective sensitivity of hesc to the inhibition of the activity of the proteasome, resulting in loss of pluripotency and cell growth at doses without any detectable effects on differentiated but cycling cells such as primary fibroblasts or hesc derived fibroblast like cells. in addition, it must be stressed that the dramatic effects on hesc pluripotency were observed at doses of the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  significantly lower than those typically found in the literature  or in mice es cells   <cit> . this observation is highly interesting in light of the recent findings of the role of the proteasome in transcription, especially in hesc. the 26s proteasome consists of a 20s core proteolytic part, capped by a 19s regulatory complex. specificity of degradation of proteins is mediated in part by poly-ubiquitination of the substrate bound for destruction. based on early work in yeast, the proteasome is known to interact with chromatin and function at multiple steps in transcription, both through proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities  <cit> . recently, szutorisz et al. reported that the 26s proteasome is assembled on intergenic and intragenic regions in es cells and act as a transcriptional silencer by blocking non-specific transcription initiation  <cit> . this mechanism involves the proteolytic activity of the 20s core by degrading non-specific preinitiation complexes, thereby preventing permissive transcription and spreading of the modified chromatin. our results are consistent with this hypothesis, but final answer on this issue will require further investigations.

this work has compared human mii oocytes and hesc to somatic tissues gene expression profiles. one goal was to provide new hints on the process of nucleus reprogramming which takes place in vivo during early embryo development or in vitro during scnt, and may thus help to improve the ips technology. indeed, since the seminal work of the team of shinya yamanaka, numerous improvement have been made, including the identification of new genes able to replace some of the original ones in the reprogramming cocktail, the use of small molecules or the replacement of the retroviral vectors by adenoviruses or plasmids  <cit> . a first observation is that human mature oocytes do not express the pluripotency core transcriptional genes pou5f1/oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  <cit> , except pou5f1/oct <dig> at low level . they neither express klf <dig> nor cmyc, which compose, with pou5f1/oct <dig> and sox <dig>  the four factors that can reprogram somatic cells by virus-mediated overexpression  <cit> . from the six "reprogramming" factors described to date, only lin <dig> was found in the oocyte/hesc signature. however, pou5f1/oct <dig>  nanog, sox <dig>  klf <dig>  lin <dig> and cmyc are all expressed by hesc. therefore, during early embryo development, the expression of these genes is induced. thus, two different molecular pathways that can reprogram adult somatic cells can be envisioned:  the process taking place in the oocyte cytoplasm, able to activate the core transcriptional genes, or  the overexpression of the core transcriptional genes themselves together with adjuvant genes, either by viral overexpression or by fusion with cells already expressing these genes. it can be speculated that the factors that lie upstream of the pluripotency core transcriptional circuitry are expressed as mrna in mature mii oocytes and are still present at blastocyst stage from which hesc are derived. thus, the oocytes/hesc signature likely includes these factors, and therefore this information could be highly informative for cell reprogramming. the signature contained numerous transcritption factors, including many zinc finger such as znf <dig>  several still poorly annotated genes such as klhl <dig>  mrs <dig>  or the selenophosphate synthetase  <dig> , displayed a strong cell cycle signature, chromatin modification genes, and also many actors of the proteasome pathway. all these genes are candidate genes to improve the efficiency of ips generation, especially in the light of the recent advances that uses non retroviral vectors but at the cost of lower efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS
human esc are not only a very promising source of cells for regenerative medicine, but are also a unique tool to understand early embryo development that can not easily be studied on live embryos because of ethical and technical limits. our comparison of human mature oocytes and hesc to a large collection of somatic samples helps to understand the early embryo development and pluripotency, and is therefore relevant for therapeutics, including improvement of the pregnancy success rate in ivf and regenerative medicine applications such as those involving cell reprogramming.
