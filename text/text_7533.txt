BACKGROUND
entamoeba histolytica is the protozoan parasite which causes human amebiasis. it is estimated that between  <dig>  and  <dig>  people die annually worldwide from this condition  <cit> . four sequential steps have been described during the trophozoite-target cell interaction: 1) adherence, 2) extracellular cytolysis, 3) contact-dependent cytolysis and 4) phagocytosis  <cit> . lysis of epithelial cells inside trophozoites requires specific and precise ph that is provided in different vacuoles  <cit> . the vacuolar h+-atpase  is the key enzyme in many, if not all, acidification processes inside vacuoles. this enzyme is a multisubunit complex that translocates protons across membranes against their electrochemical potential through atp hydrolysis. the v-atpase is formed by the v <dig> complex, corresponding to the integral membrane sector, and the v <dig> complex that constitutes the globular headpiece responsible for the catalytic activity  <cit> . the v-atpase is located in endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles, golgi vesicles, clathrin-coated vesicles, endosomes, lysosomes, storage vesicles, synaptic vesicles and the central vacuole , but it can also be found in plasma membranes  <cit> . v-atpase also participates in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways, transmembrane transport of viral contents and toxins, and in coupled transport of small molecules  <cit> . moreover, v-atpase is involved in cytosolic ph regulation, in na+, ca2+ and cd2+ uptake via h+-driven antiport, in h+-dependent transport of monoamines and γ-aminobutyrate neurotransmitters carried out by the difference in h+ concentration, and in glutamate uptake driven by the membrane voltage  <cit> . additionally, it is thought that the v-atpase is the ph sensor that regulates transport from early to late endosomes. this assumption is supported by the interaction between v-atpase and the small gtp-binding protein arf <dig> and its gdp/gtp exchange factor arno in a ph-dependent manner  <cit> .

several years ago acidification inhibition experiments of pinocytic vesicles with bafilomycin a <dig> revealed the presence of the vacuolar atpase in e. histolytica  <cit> . however, only two genes encoding for e. histolytica atpase subunits have been cloned: ehvma <dig> is an intron-less gene that encodes for the  <dig> kda subunit a of v <dig> complex  <cit> . ehvma <dig> encodes for an  <dig>  kda polypeptide corresponding to the c subunit of the v <dig> complex  <cit> . recently, proteins related to v-atpase have been identified by proteomic analysis of purified phagosomes in e. histolytica  <cit> . in order to continue with the study of subunits forming the atpase in this parasite and to investigate their role in phagocytosis, we report here the cloning and characterization of the ehvma <dig> gene which encodes for the e. histolytica b subunit of the v <dig> complex. we also performed the subcellular location of its encoded protein in trophozoites during phagocytosis.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of the gene encoding for the subunit b of the vacuolar atpase of e. histolytica
a  <dig>  bp dna fragment  was cloned into the pgem-t-easy vector. dna sequencing revealed that cloned dna contains two open reading frames  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp , separated by a  <dig> bp non-coding region  . in region i we localized a splicing consensus sequence for nuclear-encoded genes, suggesting that it could be an intron. rt-pcr assays using the primers bvac-s- <dig> and bvac-as- <dig> gave a  <dig> bp product, whereas amplification with genomic dna produced an  <dig> bp fragment, indicating that ehvma <dig> gene  contains a  <dig> bp intron . ehvma <dig> gene from clone a was 100% identical to the corresponding gene of e. histolytica hm1:imss  reported in the e. histolytica genome data bank. it encodes for a predicted  <dig> amino acid polypeptide of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . blast search of the amino acid sequence encoded by ehvma <dig> revealed a high degree of conservation with other v-atpase b subunits from a number of organisms with an identity from 34% to 78% and a similarity varying from 53% to 90%.

the ehv-atpase b subunit  has three domains : domain i,  is the beta-barrel domain . domain ii  corresponds to the core region containing the highly conserved nucleotide binding domain . domain iii  is the domain found in the atp synthase alpha/beta family . the conserved central domain contains the p-loop structure, which forms a flexible loop that interacts with one of the phosphate groups of atp in α and β subunits of f-atpase, and in v-atpase subunit a  <cit> . v-atpase b subunit from bos taurus brain cells has a region which works like a p-loop and binds bzatp, an atp analog  <cit> . b subunits conserve all residues implicated in the interaction with actin, the nucleotide binding site and the atp synthase alpha and beta subunits signature. the actin-interaction domain found in ehv-atpase b subunit was located in the region from k <dig> to v <dig>  the bzatp consensus binding site  was localized from v <dig> to q <dig> and the atp synthase alpha and beta subunits signature  was found in the region from p <dig> to s <dig> . finally, the ehv-atpaseb n- and c-terminal regions differed in size and sequence with respect to the corresponding ends of b subunits from other organisms.

expression of a specific polypeptide of the e. histolytica vacuolar atpase subunit b in bacteria
to determine if the e. histolytica genome contains sequences related to the v-atpase b subunit, we performed a blast search and found that the v-atpase a subunit was the only sequence related. it showed 23% identity and 38% similarity to ehv-atpaseb . the most divergent region between these sequences resides in their n-terminal ends. thus, we selected a  <dig> bp region  of the gene encoding for the v-atpase subunit b to be cloned in frame into prset a vector to express a  <dig> kda recombinant his-tagged polypeptide  in e. coli . this polypeptide was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography  through a ni2+-nta agarose column under denaturing conditions . in western blot assays the anti-6his-tag monoclonal antibodies recognized the induced rehbvac <dig> polypeptide band in extracts of  <dig> mm iptg induced bacteria  and purified rehbvac <dig> . this result confirms the nature of induced polypeptide. therefore, rehbvac <dig> protein was electroeluted from 12% sds-page gels and used to produce mouse polyclonal anti-rehbvac <dig> antibodies that specifically identified rehbvac <dig> in induced bacteria , while pre-immune serum did not recognize any bacterial polypeptide . mouse polyclonal anti-rehbvac <dig> antibodies reacted with a  <dig> kda band in trophozoite total extracts , which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of the full length ehv-atpase b subunit.

localization of the subunit b of v-atpase in e. histolytica trophozoites
we carried out immunodetection experiments of endogenous ehv-atpaseb protein using anti-rehbvac <dig> antibodies and paraformaldehyde-fixed trophozoites. through confocal microscopy, antibodies anti-rehbvac <dig> located the ehv-atpase b polypeptide in many small vesicles . the ehv-atpase b subunit was also observed in ehkos, but not in nuclei . some cells presented the ehv-atpase b subunit in two ehkos located in different planes . ehkos were also stained with propidium iodide   indicating they are dna-containing organelles  <cit> . nuclei did not appear pi stained in figure  <dig> because they were located in different planes  to those containing ehkos. colocalization of green and red fluorescent signals is also shown , corroborating that dna and ehv-atpase b subunit are in the same organelles. as a negative control we incubated cells without primary antibodies . light microscopy images showed cellular integrity . immunolocalization of ehv-atpase b subunit in ehkos was confirmed by western blot of an ehko-enriched fraction prepared as described, which detected the  <dig> kda band found in total protein extracts . we also determined the v-atpase activity in this fraction  using the method described in  <cit> , obtaining a specific activity of  <dig>  nanomoles of phosphate produced in one hour per microgram of protein at 37°c.

the e. histolytica vacuolar atpase subunit b was found widely distributed in all cellular membranes in phagocytic trophozoites
in confocal microscopy experiments of trophozoites during the phagocytosis of red blood cells  we observed a wide distribution of ehv-atpaseb protein through all the trophozoite membranes with the exception of nuclear membrane . ehv-atpaseb was found surrounding many vesicles of different sizes  and in plasma membrane . some areas concentrated huge amounts of the protein located in cytoplasm . the subunit b of ehv-atpase was detected in phagocytic vesicles surrounding rbcs as expected , confirming the presence of subunit b in phagocytic vacuoles as it has been previously reported  <cit> . however, our results showed no difference in the distribution of the subunit b of the vacuolar atpase at the different times of phagocytosis tested. a negative control using preimmune serum was also carried out with no fluorescent signal . nuclei were stained in red , and a merge of red and green fluorescent signals was also performed . it is noteworthy that subunit b was accumulated in huge amounts in the phagocytic mouth of a trophozoite ingesting a red blood cell . to determine if the ehvma <dig> gene was being expressed in trophozoites during erythrophagocytosis, we carried out rt-pcr experiments that showed that this gene is being expressed . as control we used the actin gene that showed that it is also being expressed during this process .

putative subunits of the vacuolar atpase found in the e. histolytica genome
we searched for the orthologous genes encoding for all the subunits of vacuolar atpase in the e. histolytica genome database  <cit> . a blast search was done using the genes encoding for the vacuolar atpase polypeptides from saccharomyces cerevisiae. e. histolytica has orthologous genes encoding for all subunits of v <dig> complex of the vacuolar atpase . the corresponding entamoeba genes were designated by the nomenclature used for the yeast vacuolar atpase. ehvma <dig> gene  encoded for the subunit a. subunit b is encoded by ehvma <dig> gene . we also found a pseudogene related to ehvma <dig>  denoted as Ψ ehvma <dig>  that was located at a different scaffold. subunits c, f, g and h are encoded by ehvma <dig>  ehvma <dig>  ehvma <dig>  and ehvma <dig> genes, respectively. on the other hand, we found two genes  encoding for the putative subunit d located in different scaffolds, which predict proteins sharing a 98% identity. subunit e is also encoded by two genes, ehvma4- <dig> and ehvma4- <dig>  which are arranged in tandem on the same dna strand in the e. histolytica genome , and encode for proteins with a 51% identity between them. orthologous genes encoding for the probable subunits of v <dig> complex were also found in the e. histolytica genome with the exception of c' and e subunits. v-atpase a subunit is encoded by two genes, ehstv <dig> and ehvph <dig>  the former is encoded at a single locus. the latter has two identical copies located at two different scaffolds. ehstv <dig> and ehvph <dig> predicted for putative proteins with 51% identity. subunits c and c" are putatively encoded by ehvma <dig>  and ehvma <dig>  respectively, and their polypeptides have 25% identity. a blast search in the e. histolytica genome using the s. cerevisiae c' protein sequence  as query reported the same genes mentioned above, but showing a lesser identity than that shown when comparing with s. cerevisiae subunits c and c" , suggesting that e. histolytica genome lacks an orthologous c' subunit encoding gene. finally, subunit d is encoded by a single copy of the ehvma <dig> gene. noteworthy all the v-atpase subunit encoding genes are located in different scaffolds.

discussion
the ehvma <dig> gene encoding for the b subunit of v-atpase is highly conserved . the protein was located in cytoplasm , plasma membrane, vacuolar membrane and in ehkos . labeling in cytoplasm could correspond to free v <dig> sectors and to v-atpase complexes found in small fluorescent vesicles which might be lysosomes  <cit> . in yeast cells, the rave complex mediates the reversible dissociation between the v <dig> and v <dig> complexes by binding to peripheral stalk subunits   <cit> , that is considered as one of the mechanisms controlling v-atpase activity  <cit> . this event seems to be regulated by the cellular environment as in yeast in response to glucose depletion  <cit> . the gene encoding for the skp <dig> subunit of the rave complex is found in the e. histolytica genome , suggesting a similar v-atpase regulation mechanism in this parasite.

on the other hand, the v-atpase b subunit found in the e. histolytica plasma membrane  could indicate that the v-atpase complex is located there and has a role in tissue invasion in a similar process of metastasizing cells that increase the acidification of the extracellular fluid to produce the destruction of normal tissue and facilitate invasion  <cit> . moreover, it could be involved in the transport of diverse solutes in a similar way as it has been described for plasmodium  <cit> . it is noteworthy the subunit b localization in ehkos , which are cytoplasmic dna-containing organelles of unknown function  <cit> . ehkos carry ehtbp  <cit> , ehc/ebp  <cit> , and ehp <dig>  <cit>  transcription factors, and the ehpfo enzyme  <cit> , but their roles in ehkos remain to be determined. another cytoplasmic dna-containing organelle described in this parasite is the crypton, which harbors the chaperonin hsp <dig>  <cit> .

mitosomes, which are dna-lacking organelles, also contain the chaperonin cpn <dig> and are considered as mitochondrial remnants  <cit> . mitosomes have also been found in other organisms  <cit> . ehkos and cryptons could be similar organelles as they carry dna. however, ehkos and mitosomes are clearly different  <cit> . a possible role for the v-atpase located in ehkos could be the atp synthesis using the membrane-bound h+- translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase  activity found in some organelles in trophozoites  <cit> . alternatively, v-atpase could be pumping out h+ as a consequence of the b subunit localization towards the lumen of these organelles , in order to keep ph regulated and avoid degradation of their content.

rbcs ingestion by trophozoites revealed a clustering process of ehv-atpase b subunit in the vicinity of phagosomes after  <dig> min of phagocytosis . the principal route of v-atpase delivery to phagosomes in d. discoideum is by fusion with pre-existing acidic endosomal vesicles, prior to their content delivery into phagosomes  <cit> . a similar process might be occurring in entamoeba, where lysosomes could be stored in the cytosol prior to their fusion with phagosomal vacuoles. during erythrophagocytosis a pre-phagosomal vacuole  containing rab <dig> and rab7a proteins is gradually acidified by fusion with lysosomes. during the first 5– <dig> min rab <dig> is dissociated from ppvs, and digestive proteins are transported from ppvs to phagosomes via rab7a-mediated vesicular transport  <cit> . although this process needs more studies to identify all proteins involved, v-atpase should be released during ppv maturation. in addition, interactions of v-atpase to cytoskeleton through subunits b and c, which are able to bind actin, are essentials for its proper function. for example, the osteoclast subunit b is responsible for microfilaments-v-atpase interactions  <cit> . the putative actin-binding domain that was found in ehv-atpase subunit b suggests that this process is conserved in this parasite .

in eukaryotic cells the v <dig> complex is formed by the subunits a3b3cdefg2h1– <dig> and the v <dig> complex by subunits ac4c'c"de  <cit> . based on the genes found in the e. histolytica genome, we propose a putative model for the structure of the vacuolar atpase in this parasite . the v <dig> complex might be composed of a ring of five or six proteolipid subunits  and one molecule of each a and d subunits. remarkably, e. histolytica v-atpase lacks subunits e and c'. however, the existence of non-related proteins to e and c' subunits that could evolve separately very early in evolution in entamoeba is possible. it is important to note that the stoichiometry of the e and g strong interaction is not well established yet. a relationship of two g molecules per one e molecule was assumed, however recent data support that in v-atpase, g and e subunits are present in more than one copy and thus two peripheral stalks connecting v <dig> to v <dig> could exist  <cit> .

most of the subunits of the e. histolytica v-atpase are encoded by single genes, excepting for subunits d, e, and a, which are encoded by two genes in each case . in the case of the subunit e, two e isoforms have been found in mouse  <cit> , and three in arabidopsis  <cit> . several pea epicotyls v-atpases isoenzymes exhibiting different ratios of e <dig> and e <dig> isoforms have been purified, exhibiting differences in their km and vmax of atp hydrolysis, and different tissue distribution in the whole plant  <cit> . yeast has two subunit a isoforms: 1) vph1p, which is targeted to the vacuolar membrane, and 2) stv1p which is targeted to the late golgi apparatus  <cit> . mammals have four genes encoding for different subunit a isoforms, often showing cell-type or tissue-specific locations  <cit> . a special case is paramecium, which contains  <dig> a subunit isoforms, which provide a specific location and function for v-atpase in at least seven different compartments  <cit> . thus, e. histolytica could have at least two v-atpase isoforms, one distributed in vacuoles, and the other in the golgi apparatus that could be more primitive in trophozoites than those from other systems due to the lack of a typical golgi structure  <cit> . more studies are needed to elucidate the v-atpase role in the physiology of e. histolytica trophozoites.

CONCLUSIONS
we cloned the ehvma <dig> gene which encodes for the highly conserved v-atpase b subunit. this protein was immunolocated in ehkos, in plasma membrane, vesicles, phagocytic vacuoles, and also in the cytoplasm. most of the orthologous genes encoding for the v-atpase subunits were also identified in the e. histolytica genome showing that this ehv-atpase is a highly conserved complex. the in silico analysis of the genes encoding for the v-atpase subunits in the e. histolytica genome revealed that the v <dig> complex has all the eight subunits found in v-atpases. however, the v <dig> complex lacks the subunits e and c'.
