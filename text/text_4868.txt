BACKGROUND
non-typhoid salmonellosis is one of the most frequently-reported bacterial foodborne diseases and is a major economic and public health issue worldwide. european data show that salmonella is the second most predominant bacterial pathogen, causing around  <dig>  human cases in  <dig>  <cit> . in the united states, salmonella serotypes cause an estimated  <dig>  million cases of foodborne disease each year  <cit> . the primary reservoirs of salmonella are food-producing animals, the three main sources being poultry, cattle and pigs. of the numerous different serotypes, only a few are frequently isolated from human and animal sources. serotypes enteritidis and typhimurium are the most frequently encountered in human and animal sources. together, they represent 80% of confirmed human salmonellosis cases in europe, with a marked decrease in serotype enteritidis cases but an increase in s. typhimurium cases  <cit> . serotype typhimurium was implicated in 47% of the notified foodborne outbreaks in france in  <dig> http://www.invs.sante.fr. of non-human isolates, this has been the most commonly-reported serotype in the french salmonella network in its  <dig> years of surveillance. furthermore, in many countries, definitive phage type  <dig>  has increased among serotype typhimurium in the two past decades. identifying typhimurium phage types requires maintaining a phage library and specially trained personnel. there is thus a real need, therefore, to develop alternative molecular approaches for identifying typhimurium dt <dig> strains. a dna sequence unique to the dt <dig> phage type has already been described   <cit> . molecular analysis using relevant gene markers can improve the surveillance and typing of this well-isolated serotype. markers selected in this study were especially related to virulence and antimicrobial resistance. salmonella pathogenicity is based on the presence of various mobile elements. five salmonella pathogenicity islands  are known to be involved in the virulence expression and invasivity of salmonella  <cit> . spi genes encode various functional proteins implicated in cellular invasion and the interaction between host and bacterial cells, such as the type iii secretion system and effector proteins. in this study, the presence of four spis was investigated by targeting their gene determinants: the ssaq gene implicated in the secretion system apparatus protein , the mgtc gene encoding the intramacrophage survival protein for spi- <dig>  the spi4d gene encoding hlyd family secretion protein for spi- <dig> and the sopb gene implicated in the translocated effector protein of t3ss for spi- <dig>  the diversity of the salmonella genome is related to the acquisition of plasmids that confer a selective advantage via antimicrobial resistance and/or virulence expression  <cit> . the common feature of salmonella virulence plasmid loci is a well-conserved  <dig>  kb region that plays a major role in the expression of the virulence phenotype in salmonella. this spv-locus may be present in serotype typhimurium isolates and was tested by targeting the spvc gene.

salmonella genomic island sgi <dig> is a  <dig> kb integrative mobilizable element that confers multidrug resistance and may also be involved in the increased virulence and invasivity of salmonella typhimurium dt <dig> strains. sgi <dig> has also been described in other serotypes, possibly acquired by horizontal transfer  <cit> . in this study, the presence of sgi <dig> was investigated by targeting the left junction in the flanking region of sgi <dig> <cit> . sgi <dig> harbors a cluster of genes containing the complex class  <dig> integron that encodes multidrug resistance, most often associated with the acssut pentaresistance to amoxicillin , chloramphenicol/florfenicol , streptomycin/spectinomycin , sulfonamide  and tetracycline . the 5' well-conserved region including the inti <dig> determinant that encodes integrase from class  <dig> integron was targeted, as was the sul <dig> gene that codes for resistance to sulphonamides. antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams has also been reported in isolates from human and animal sources . resistance mechanisms such as penicillinase hyperproduction, extended spectrum beta-lactamases  or inhibitor-resistant tem beta-lactamase are encoded by the plasmid-mediated blatem gene. the presence and diffusion of blatem genes are a serious public health issue, and could be responsible of treatment failure.

the aim of this work was to develop a simple, easy-to-use tool for salmonella genotyping based on the detection of genes of significant public health concern. the macroarray-based assay was applied to a large collection of serotype typhimurium isolates representative of various sources and sampled at different times over a 10-year period.

methods
principle of the genedisc® array
the principle of the genedisc® array  has been described previously  <cit> . it is a disposable plastic tray the size of a compact disc. its rim is engraved with  <dig> reaction microchambers preloaded with desiccated primers and fluorescence-labeled probes for target detection. the genedisc® is divided into six sectors, each linked to six microchambers. a duplex real-time pcr can be performed in each microchamber using reporter dye 6-fam  or rox . each genedisc® can be used to simultaneously investigate six strains in order to detect  <dig> markers. the 40-cycle thermal pcr program takes  <dig> minutes. results are recorded and can also be followed in real time on the computer screen. genesystems' genedisc® system has been recently used to genotype verotoxin-producing escherichia coli  <cit> .

genedisc® array developed in this study
the genedisc® array was designed to simultaneously detect  <dig> specific gene targets, together with a negative control and a positive salmonella genus control   <cit> . this "stm genedisc®" array was set up as follows: microwell 1) inti <dig>  and sopb ; microwell 2) blatem  and ssaq ; microwell 3) spvc  and spi_4d , microwell 4) dt <dig> 16s to 23s spacer  and mgtc ; microwell 5) ttrc gene  and sul <dig> ; and microwell 6) sgi <dig> left junction  and negative control . the oligonucleotide primers and gene probes used in the genedisc® are given in table  <dig>  all the oligonucleotides were purchased from sigma-aldrich . genesystems  was responsible for genedisc® spotting and manufacturing. all the gene markers are detected with the genedisc® system in less than one hour of operation.

bacterial strains
a total of  <dig> isolates selected from  <dig>  serotype typhimurium isolates from the french food safety agency  collection were analyzed. they were isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> in france and identified as salmonella enterica enterica serotype typhimurium according to the white-kauffmann-le minor scheme by agglutination with o- and h-antigen specific sera . the salmonella isolates are sent on a voluntary basis through a network  <dig> veterinary or food analysis laboratories covering different french districts. sampling was carried out firstly to remove duplicate strains and to select different sources of isolation and secondly on a random basis. the selected isolates can be considered representative of the total collection of the salmonella network. thus, for each year, at least one representative isolate from the three main sectors--animals, food or the environment --was tested. within each sector, we then selected strains from various food-animal sources  including primary production sites, livestock farms and raw materials from processing sites or from domestic or wild species. as described in table  <dig>  isolates were from samples of pigs , poultry , cattle  and from other minor domestic or wild animal species . the latter included strains from birds , sheep , horses , goats , snakes  and rabbits . we also investigated strains isolated from the environment  and food products , including ready-to-eat foods , pork , dairy products , beef , seafood , egg products  and vegetables . analyses were also conducted on a panel of few clinical human salmonella typhimurium isolates  collected by the national reference centre for salmonella  and selected according to their various sources and pfge genetic diversity.

1birds , sheep , horses , goats , snakes , rabbits , unknown .

 <dig> cooked dishes , pork , diary products , beef , seafood , egg products , vegetables , unknown .

a set of control strains was used to validate the stm genedisc® array . reference strain lt <dig> was used as a positive control for testing spi genetic markers , and virulence plasmid pslt . typhimurium strain 08ceb5766sal was used as a negative control for testing the ssaq, sopb and spvc markers, whereas the 00- <dig> strain kindly provided by the federal institute for risk assessment  in berlin, germany, was used as a negative template to test the spi4_d and mgtc markers. all these negative control strains had been tested previously using conventional pcr.

the specificity of the phage type dt <dig> marker targeting the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region was tested with  <dig> strains of different phage types: atypical dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> variant , u <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt12a , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , u <dig>  and  <dig> strains of phage type dt <dig> 

phage-typing had already been performed either in the laboratory of gastrointestinal pathogens at the health protection agency  or in the national reference centre on salmonella at the institut pasteur . the presence of sgi <dig> was explored by targeting the left junction sequence and detecting integrase of class  <dig> integron gene  and a sulfonamide resistance determinant . the positive control strain used for these three markers was s. typhimurium strain 05ceb1571sal, a strain isolated from turkey and well-characterized by a european project. positive results had already been detected for the left junction sequence, inti <dig> and sul <dig> genes. finally, the study validated detection of the beta-lactam resistance gene  by testing anses and european collection strains 07ceb5289sal of serotype virchow, 07ceb9150sal and  <dig>  of serotype paratyphi b var.java, and  <dig>  of serotype isangii carrying respectively blatem- <dig> , blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig> and blatem- <dig> variants linked to esbl phenotypes .

for test purposes, bacteria were cultured from a single colony on agar plates and grown overnight at 37°c. dna from a small aliquot of the colony corresponding to approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria was extracted using the instagene matrix  and  <dig> μl of the dna extracts were tested using the stm genedisc® array.

data analysis
results are based on reaction curves and other features of real-time pcr that can be analyzed and printed as tables with ms excel . to normalize results, a maximum cycle threshold--indicating the pcr cycle th at shows a significant increase in the fluorescence signal compared to the background--and minimum fluorescence amplitude were defined at  <dig> cycles and  <dig> arbitrary fluorescence units respectively. all percentage values for each genetic marker were calculated with their confidence interval at 95% according to a fisher-snedecor distribution. for phage-type dt <dig> determination, the specificity calculation was the proportion of negative tests which are true negative. the sensitivity was the proportion of positive tests which are true positive.

the normalized presence or absence of each gene determinant for each strain was analyzed as character values using bionumerics software version  <dig>  . a cluster analysis was performed with the dice coefficient using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages . cluster analysis was used to define different groups of genotypes, the term "genotype" indicating strains with a similar gene determinant profile.

RESULTS
prevalence of gene determinants in serotype typhimurium strains
-virulence determinants
all the investigated strains carried the ttrc marker specific to the salmonella genus. the virulence potential of typhimurium strains was characterized by testing five virulence-associated determinants. four of them are located on spi- <dig> to - <dig> and one, spvc, is related to the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid . each marker was tested against one positive strain  and against a specific negative control. the efficiency of each marker was checked and validated. spi determinants are well conserved and usually present in all salmonella enterica strains because they were acquired during salmonella evolution  <cit> . nevertheless, in this study, some atypical strains  were observed and tested negative for one or two spi markers.

we found three strains that were negative for ssaq, and a single strain negative for spi4_d or sopb. these results suggest that there has been deletion or changes in the spi- <dig> and/or spi- <dig> region. the mgtc marker was detected in all  <dig> tested strains, indicating that the spi- <dig> region was always present, whatever the strain . the spvc gene pslt determinant was frequently present  in the studied strains whatever their isolation source . these results are consistent with a recent virulotyping study on a large european collection of salmonella strains, where spvc was found only in serotype typhimurium  and enteritidis  among the five serotypes regulated in europe  <cit> . in the same study, spi- <dig> to - <dig> determinants were conserved in the five serotypes.

-salmonella genomic island  determinants
the sgi <dig> structure was detected using the left junction region, the integrase of class  <dig> integron gene  and the sul <dig> resistance determinant located in the multidrug resistance region. the left junction sequence, inti <dig> and sul <dig> genetic markers are all closely associated with sgi <dig>  not surprisingly, the frequencies of each marker were similar. nevertheless, some strains carrying inti <dig> and/or sul <dig> were negative for the left junction region. moreover, a few sul <dig> positive strains were negative for inti <dig> and/or the left junction region. such results could suggest these markers are plasmid-mediated.

- phage type dt <dig> determinant
the phage type dt <dig> determinant was explored by targeting a 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer sequence. this sequence is considered to be specific to dt <dig> strains  <cit> . positive and negative control strains were used for this marker. of the  <dig> confirmed dt <dig> strains, all but four were positive. furthermore, the sequence was not detected in the atypical dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> variant , u <dig> , dt <dig> , dt <dig> , dt12a , dt <dig> , dt <dig>  or u <dig>  strains. however, we observe a cross-reaction with one dt <dig> strain and nine of the ten dt <dig> strains investigated out of the  <dig> strains tested. the specificity and sensitivity values for this gene target were of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the dt <dig> marker was detected in 47% of the  <dig> tested strains with unequal distribution among isolate sources. this marker was carried by 71% of human strains . furthermore, the dt <dig> marker was observed in around 60% of environmental samples. nearly half the food product strains carried this marker, while the lowest frequencies occurred in poultry and other animal species, with around 40% of positive strains.

- antimicrobial resistance determinants
beta-lactam resistance including esbl and non-esbl producing strains was explored by targeting a family of blatem genes encoding tem beta-lactamase enzymes. reference positive strains carrying blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig> and blatem- <dig> were correctly detected with the genedisc® array.

the blatem determinant was unequally distributed among the tested strains. the highest level--36%--was detected in human isolates. in animal or food sources, it was found in around  <dig> to 20% of strains .

sulfonamide resistance was detected by targeting the sul <dig> determinant, most often associated with the sgi <dig> gene cluster and phage type dt <dig> strains. sul <dig> rates varied according to isolation sources, the highest levels being found in swine  and bovine  isolates and the lowest in poultry  and other minor animal species .

assignment of typhimurium genotypes
all the strains were classified according to their genotype determined by the combination of the ten investigated markers. using this combination of markers, the  <dig> strains were grouped into  <dig> different genotypes according to the upgma method. a dendrogram was generated using the dice correlation coefficient. genotypes were clustered into three main groups and two minor groups named a to e .

group a was composed of  <dig> strains divided into nine profiles: a <dig> to a <dig>  some of them were relatively rare, whereas two were very frequently observed . strains in this group were usually negative for the dt <dig> determinant  but positive for the sulfonamides resistance marker . the class  <dig> integron marker  was never detected, though some group a strains harbored the sgi <dig> determinant. moreover, the beta-lactam resistance determinant tem was present in three strains with a <dig> profiles. the major genotype a <dig> accounted for 67% of group a strains and was linked to the presence of all four spi determinants and the plasmid-associated spvc determinant. a second profile, a <dig>  occurred more frequently than the others, accounting for 24% of group a strains. a <dig> and a <dig> genotypes were very closely related as the a <dig> profile shared the a <dig> determinant profile, differing only by the absence of spvc. both profiles were encountered every year in strains from various sources . group b was the largest, containing  <dig> strains. the  <dig> genotypes of group b were distributed throughout the 10-year study period . the most common genotype was b <dig>  detected in all types of sources and encountered in 76% of group b strains . all determinants except the blatem gene were positive in this genotype. the other  <dig> profiles were much less frequent . furthermore, 84% of group b strains were positive for the dt <dig> marker. group b strains consistently exhibited sul <dig> and inti <dig> determinants, whereas 88% of these strains  carried the sgi <dig> left junction marker. as previously reported, the sgi <dig> left junction region was not conserved among all isolates  <cit> . atypical profiles were detected in three strains, of which two were isolated from rabbit farms and feces. these two strains were negative for the spi_4d determinant located on spi- <dig> and assigned to the b <dig> profile. the third atypical strain, isolated from an eagle, was negative for the ssaq marker and assigned to the b <dig> profile .

group c included  <dig> strains divided into  <dig> genotypes that were found throughout the study period. all strains from group c were negative for sul <dig> marker. they were also negative for inti <dig> and sgi <dig> left junction determinants except for two inti <dig> positive strains  isolated either from poultry or swine sources. likewise, the dt <dig> marker was rare, observed in only  <dig> %  of group c strains .

two other minor groups--d and e--were identified, each composed of a single strain. genotypes derived from these groups were considered atypical and uncommon. some spi virulence genes were missing: ssaq for the single group d strain and both mgtc and spi4d for the group e strain. group d and e strains were both recovered from environmental samples, suggesting the presence of such atypical isolates in ecosystem niches .

association of the genetic markers from poultry, swine and human sources
strains from human and swine sources showed the three sgi1-associated markers  more frequently  than those from poultry . for the three markers, statistical differences in percentages were observed between swine and poultry sources. table  <dig> highlights the finding that poultry-source strains harbored all the investigated determinants less frequently, with the exception of spi-associated genes.

in poultry sources , great diversity was observed as  <dig> different genotypes were identified and distributed over the main three groups, a, b and c. six different genotypes identified in group a accounted for 54% of the isolates  mainly detected in two major genotypes a <dig> and a <dig>  these two genotypes are those with low-marker patterns and account for more than half of the poultry strains. the frequently-encountered b <dig> and b <dig> genotypes were also detected for 33% of poultry strains out of a total of  <dig> different genotypes found in poultry sources the five group c genotypes contained few poultry strains  compared to the total. in swine sources, the  <dig> strains were assigned to  <dig> genotypes . most of the strains were categorized in seven group b genotypes, especially b <dig> . a single strain of genotype c <dig> was detected in a swine source. all these group b and c strains carried most of the tested determinants, especially the three sgi1-associated markers and the antimicrobial resistance determinants. finally, the  <dig> strains from human sources were divided into nine different genotypes. the human strains shared the same genotypes as the poultry or swine strains whether in group a, b or c, with the exception of a single strain that exhibited the c <dig> pattern never found in other sources. sixty-four percent of group b human strains carried the sgi <dig> determinant . genotype b <dig>  positive for all determinants was almost distributed in human source .

discussion
over the past decade, serotype typhimurium has been the most prevalent among salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotypes in human and animal sources worldwide. furthermore, multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged, most often linked to phage type dt <dig>  many data regarding both the emergence and increase of phage type dt <dig> strains over the past years are available in some countries  <cit> . in contrast, no recent data are available regarding phage-type frequencies in french typhimurium strains. a recent publication highlighted the lack of standardization of the phage-typing method within laboratories  <cit> . detecting the phage type dt <dig> determinant using the genedisc® appears to be a valuable fast alternative method for monitoring isolates. markers for sgi <dig> , dt <dig>  and antibiotic-resistance  were tested in the genedisc® array developed here. analysis of the results confirm the link between the three markers as previously described  <cit>  and show that most of the tested typhimurium collection carried all three markers simultaneously. thus, of the  <dig> isolates tested,  <dig>  were assigned to genotype b <dig>  the most common genotype of the  <dig> identified. the b <dig> genotype was characterized by the presence of all ten tested markers, except the blatem gene. other genotypes were closely related to b <dig>  differing by only one or two markers. the majority of occurrences of b <dig> and b <dig> genotypes characterized by a high number of markers were host-specific. they have been observed in 64%, 60% and 57% of pig, cattle and human isolates respectively whereas only detected in 28% of poultry sources. the integrase of class  <dig> integron  is usually detected in isolates carrying sgi <dig>  in our study, the inti <dig> determinant was only detected in 52% of the overall panel of isolates. in contrast, the two strains assigned to genotype b <dig> were positive for the dt <dig> marker and inti <dig> but negative for the sgi <dig> left junction and also exhibited a multi-drug-resistant phenotype. another study also described this situation and concluded that class  <dig> integron gene cassettes should be detected in  <dig> % of salmonella isolates in which the sgi <dig> left junction is absent  <cit> . in another study, one dt <dig> strain  <cit>  presented the same pattern associated with an acssut pattern indicating the presence of an sgi <dig> variant in which molecular determinants could not be detected.

our results revealed 36% blatem-positive strains in human strains and 11% in animal strains. beta-lactamase production continues to be the leading cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, there have been reports of an increased incidence and prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases  in recent years. the first esbls arose in the early  <dig> s from mutation from widespread, broad-spectrum beta-lactamases such as tem- <dig> or shv- <dig>  monitoring the frequency of blatem in salmonella is therefore a major public health concern. in our study, we identified  <dig> different genotypes harboring the blatem gene, representing 13% of isolates . the most frequent blatem gene source was observed in human isolates , whereas it was detected in only 8% of environment-source strains and 11% of animal and food-product isolates. these results are consistent with a study performed on french salmonella typhimurium isolates to determine blatem emergence in human and non-human sources which revealed the presence of blatem in 26% of human isolates and 23% of animal isolates  <cit> . of the  <dig> different blatem genotypes, six of the group b genotypes were always associated with the inti <dig> marker. the inti <dig> gene includes a site-specific recombination system capable of integrating and expressing genes contained in structures known as mobile gene cassettes. integrons are described as a structure with high gene diversity in cassettes and a major reservoir of antibiotic-resistance genes, suggesting a broad role in adaptation during bacterial evolution and a major public health concern. in our study, the presence of inti <dig> from sgi <dig> in the absence of the sgi <dig> left junction was observed in nine group b genotypes, two group c genotypes and never in group a. moreover, all the group b genotypes harboring the blatem gene contained the sul <dig> determinant. other such atypical strains were encountered during a european study on the molecular sub-typing of salmonella genomic islands on a large collection of isolates from different countries. this last study highlighted a correlation between spvc positive strains and the presence of blatem not observed in the current study  <cit> . one of the main genotypes, a <dig>  exhibited the four spi- <dig> to - <dig> determinants in the absence of all the other targeted genes. a frequent, closely-related a <dig> genotype also harbored the same spi pattern in addition to the plasmid-associated spvc determinant. along with the b <dig> and c <dig> genotypes, these two major a <dig> and a <dig> genotypes were detected in all sources, particularly human, poultry and swine sources, which suggest that they are widespread throughout various niches. salmonella plasmid-encoded virulence factors are a selective advantage to some salmonella variants for colonizing new niches over the course of salmonella evolution  <cit> . our finding also indicates that typhimurium strains could share common combinations of markers whatever their source. in contrast, some genotypes were unique to animal sources: a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig> were unique to poultry sources; b <dig> and c <dig> were unique to swine sources. no genotypes were assigned exclusively to human strains, but the number of clinical strains tested was fairly low. although the studied collection of strains was representative of the main animal and food sources, the salmonella network collects salmonella isolates on a voluntary basis. there may, therefore, have been some bias in the selected strains, especially for serotype typhimurium mainly serotyped in other veterinary or food analysis laboratories. moreover, the number of strains tested from each source was not evenly distributed. the high proportion of poultry isolates is due to european regulations in this production sector, leading to many surveillance and sampling programs with monitoring and official controls.

studies suggest that salmonella plasmid-encoded virulence factors are a selective advantage to some salmonella variants for colonizing new niches over the course of salmonella evolution  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the genedisc® macroarray presented in this study made it possible to easily explore variability of the ten relevant gene determinants within typhimurium very quickly during a on-hour run. based on the presence or absence of these markers,  <dig> different marker combinations  were observed among the  <dig> studied isolates, recovered mainly from food, animal or human sources. three major genotypes were defined, being observed in 75% of the studied strains. although spi determinants were almost always present, our findings show variation in the detection of other gene determinants, especially for the sgi <dig> specific determinants , sul <dig> and blatem. in a microarray-based study on the characterization of salmonella subspecies i isolates, most intra-serotype variation involved differences in only a few regions of the core genome  <cit> . this is the case for serotype typhimurium. this study found major variation in the presence or absence of other gene determinants, as most of these determinants are plasmid- or transposon-mediated. these variations can be explained by intra-serotype horizontal gene exchanges that generate numerous genotype combinations. these horizontal gene transfer events may also occur between serotypes, as described in some studies demonstrating sgi <dig> lateral transfer from serotype typhimurium to other serotypes  <cit> . this study highlighted variations in genotype frequencies according to source. low-marker determinant genotypes were mostly detected in poultry sources, whereas high-marker determinant genotypes were observed in swine, cattle and human sources.

serotyping cannot detect intra-serotype variation, so microarrays are currently most commonly used for comparative genome hybridization and gene expression studies. nevertheless, although the high-density microarray-based approach has become more popular, these tools are limited by the availability of skilled personnel and require sophisticated equipment generally not available in routine surveillance laboratories  <cit> . this study demonstrates a very simple, specific, high-throughput, real-time multiplex pcr-based method that can determine genotypes for a preliminary analysis of typhimurium intra-serotype diversity. based on the same principle, the genedisc® system can be enhanced and extended to other pertinent targets and genes according to the issue to be addressed, such as serotype identification or emerging new resistance mechanisms.
