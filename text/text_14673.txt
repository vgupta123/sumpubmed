BACKGROUND
methionine residues of polypeptide chains are common targets of oxidation phenomena which alter conformation, sub-cellular localization, and aggregation state of proteins causing detrimental effects on vital cell functions and activities  <cit> . aerobic organisms thus urgently need to repair their methionine-oxidized proteins and their minimal gene sets systematically include msr genes  <cit> .

increasing concentrations of water-borne signaling proteins , which euplotes raikovi uses to promote its vegetative  growth and the sexual phenomenon of conjugation  <cit> , were observed to undergo oxidation in cause-effect relationships with cell ageing  <cit> . this oxidation hits the methionine residues that are more exposed on the surface of the pheromone molecular structure and was shown to cause remarkable modifications of protein activity  <cit> , as is the case in other cell systems  <cit> . to shed light on the molecular mechanism evolved by e. raikovi to repair its methionine-oxidized pheromones, attention was focused on the msr genes that are transcribed in the cell somatic nucleus  characterized by an eccentric sub-chromosomic organization in which individual, gene-size dna molecules are replicated in thousands of copies fully autonomous for both replication and transcription  <cit> .

differently from the msrb gene showing a single form, the gene specifying msra was found to be present in the e. raikovi macronucleus in multiple isoforms  <cit> . one isoform, designated as msrab gene, is described here for its unique nucleotide sequence containing information for the synthesis of msra and msrb proteins characterized by unequivocal structural relationships with msra and msrb of alphaproteobacteria.

RESULTS
the msrab gene cloning involved two pcr steps. a 231-bp msra-specific dna fragment was first generated through amplification of total dna preparations run with a combination of degenerate oligonucleotides  specific to amino acid sequence stretches conserved in msra proteins of various organisms. in a second step, two nested pcr amplifications were run using primers  specific to this dna fragment in combination with a primer  specific to the c4a4/g4t <dig> repeats that are distinctive of the telomeric ends of every euplotes macronuclear gene-size molecule  <cit> . among four structurally distinct gene isoforms that were obtained, we reconstructed the full-length sequence of the longest isoform  by overlapping the individual sequences. the reconstructed sequence was then confirmed by sequencing the amplification product of a pcr run with primers  specific to regions located close to its telomeric ends.

instead of including a single open reading frame  like the other three gene isoforms , the 1595-bp isoform exceptionally included three potential orfs .figure  <dig>

the first orf , spanning from atg at position  <dig> to taa at position  <dig>  matched the orf of the three other gene sequences . it encodes a 168-amino acid msra protein showing a much closer structural identity  to msras of rhodobacterales, such as thalassobacter  and oceanicola, and rhizobiales such as sinorhizobium, than to any eukaryotic msra those of ciliates such as tetrahymena and paramecium included .figure  <dig>

the second orf , spanning from atg at position  <dig> to tag at position  <dig> and partially overlapping with orf- <dig>  includes  an in-frame tga codon which, however, is most likely not committed to stop translation. at least in principle, it should code for cysteine, or selenocysteine, so as tga usually does in euplotes  <cit> . the 152-amino acid n-terminal region of the 281-amino acid sequence encoded by this orf shows significant relationships not with other msra proteins, but with bacterial msrbs lacking cys-xxx-xxx-cys zn-ion binding motifs  <cit> . its alignment is much closer  to msrbs of rhodobacterales such as roseovarius, roseobacter, thalassobacter and oceanicola, and rhizobiales such as sinorhizobium and rhizobium, than to any eukaryotic msrb including the msrb of e. raikovi itself .figure  <dig>

the third orf , spanning from atg at position  <dig> to taa at position  <dig> and containing another in-frame tga, encodes a 75-amino acid protein not related to msr proteins. its 40-amino acid n-terminal segment is 55_60% identical to the c-terminal sequence of the lysr-type transcription regulator of rhizobium, sinorhizobium, and sphingopyxis. in addition to being strongly conserved among rhizobiales and sphingomonadales  <cit> , this regulatory protein is known to be determined by genes carried by dna regions destined to be transferred from one to another bacterial genome  <cit> .

to obtain evidence that the msrab gene is a functional and effectively expressed gene, cdna preparations were obtained from cells previously induced to increase their anti-oxidative enzyme synthesis by a mild oxidative stress , and subjected to pcr amplification with primer combinations specific to each orf . two msra-specific 368-bp and 660-bp products were obtained, indicating that orf- <dig> is either the only one to be expressed, or is expressed to a much higher extent than the other two orfs.

the bacterial origin of the three orfs of the e. raikovi macronuclear msrab gene is well explained by a comparative analysis with the organization of the msra, msrb, and transcription-regulator gene sequences in thalassobacter arenae, sinorhizobium meliloti and sphingopyxis alaskensis genomes  <cit> . in all these alphaproteobacteria, the msrb and msra coding genes lie adjacent to one another and the tga stop codon of the msrb coding region partially overlaps , or is separated by none , or only two nucleotides  from the atg start codon of the msra coding region . in addition, in t. arenae and s. alaskensis the transcription-activator gene is located apart from the msr coding genes  <cit> . in s. meliloti, instead, the distance is only 114-bp from the atg of the msrb coding region  <cit>  and the msra/msrb/transcription-activator gene cluster does not lie in the chromosome, but in one of the two symbiotic mega-plasmids   <cit> .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
genome analysis from a large variety of pro- and eukaryotes indicates that gene transfer among the three domains of life is a recurrent phenomenon in biological evolution. it also suggests that eukaryotic genomes preferentially retain those prokaryotic genes which encode enzymes capable of conferring adaptive and evolutionary advantages  <cit> . the finding that e. raikovi uses msrs from alphaproteobacteria to repair methionine-oxidized proteins supports these concepts, and implies that ciliates in general expand their genetic resources from the acquisition of bacterial gene sequences.

the pervasive tendency of euplotes species to host endosymbiotic bacteria in their cytoplasm  <cit> , and the fact that rhizobiales include numerous symbiotic species  <cit>  would suggest that the origin of the msrab coding sequence lies in some sinorhizobium species living as endosymbionts in e. raikovi. however, present-day stable cytoplasmic hosts of e. raikovi appear to be gammaproteobacteria, in primis francisella endociliophora  <cit> , which have msr genes with sequences markedly different from those of the e. raikovi msrab coding sequences .

an alternative hypothesis accounting for the origin of the msrab gene is suggested by the doolittle’s aphorism “you are what you eat”  <cit> . it considers that the origin of the msrab gene resides in some rhodobacterales or rhizobiales species that are usually ingested as food by e. raikovi. molecular investigations and cultivation-based studies have consistently revealed that both rhodobacterales of the so-called “marine alpha group” and rhizobiales of the genus rhizobium are cosmopolitan and dominant members of microbial communities in marine sediments  <cit> . furthermore, they contribute to the mediterranean subsurface microbial community of which e. raikovi is a common member  <cit> .
