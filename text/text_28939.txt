BACKGROUND
the signaling pathways that drive different normal and pathological cellular responses are controlled by microenvironmental cues, including cell-cell interactions, ecm-integrin engagement and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors. this intracellular signal transduction creates unique response-dependent epitopes that can be detected by specific antibodies providing the opportunity to measure signaling events by various immuno-techniques. phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry enables measurement of the phosphorylation status of multiple intracellular signaling proteins at a single-cell level  <cit> . however, the laminar fluidic flow systems of standard flow cytometers require that cells are in suspension and a near-spherical configuration for effective analysis. to allow the adaptation of phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry approach to study primary adherent human cells, we took advantage of the broad temperature-independent activity of trypsin to allow proteolytic release of single adherent cells at low temperatures. we show that cold-trypsin phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry analysis can be used to quantify phosphorylated erk  levels in single human pulmonary artery-derived smooth muscle cells  exposed to different ecm proteins.

methods
cold trypsin phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry analysis of adherent cells
low passage  pasmcs  were grown at 37°c, 5% co <dig> in human fibroblast growth factor -supplemented smooth muscle growth medium- <dig>  on ecm protein coated tissue culture plates until about 80% confluence. tissue culture plates were coated by passive adsorption with collagen i , fibronectin  and laminin  . pasmc were serum starved overnight prior to stimulation with  <dig> nm phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate  for 5 minutes or 20% fetal bovine serum  for 15 minutes. the cells were placed on ice immediately after stimulation to quench cell signaling. the cells were then washed twice with ice cold phosphate buffered saline  before adding ice cold  <dig> % trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid . culture plates were kept on ice and monitored by microscopy until the cells had completely rounded up and detached from the cell culture dish . alternatively, cells were detached with  <dig> % trypsin-edta at 37°c for 2 minutes. a 16% paraformaldehyde  solution  was added directly to the single cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of  <dig> % pfa. the cells were incubated in the fixative for 20 minutes at room temperature. the cells were thereafter washed with ice cold pbs and pelleted before they were permeabilized in 100% ice-cold methanol  overnight at 4°c  <cit> . to stain the cells for flow cytometry, the samples were first centrifuged at  <dig> × g for 5 minutes to remove the methanol and then washed with facs buffer . cells were then stained with rabbit anti-p44/ <dig> mapk  antibody  at a dilution of 1: <dig> for 30 minutes at room temperature. the cell suspension was then washed with facs buffer before goat anti-rabbit igg-alexa fluor  <dig>  was added at a concentration of 1: <dig>  as a secondary antibody. the cells were incubated for 1 hour in darkness at room temperature before being washed once more with facs buffer. samples were run on a bd accuri c <dig>  equipped with 488 nm and 640 nm lasers at the university of bergen flow cytometry core facility. daily quality control is performed on the instrument using 8- and 6- peak bead sets. the standard bandpass filter used for alexa fluor 647: 675/ <dig> alexa fluor  <dig> . a minimum of  <dig>  events was collected for each sample. the gating strategy comprised a standard fsc/ssc live cell gate, followed by a fsc-a/fsc-h single cell gate to minimize inclusion of debris, dead cells and aggregates in the analysis of alexa fluor  <dig> fluorescence. alternatively fixable live/dead dyes may be added to prior to pfa treatment to enhance discrimination of dead cells in the analysis. flow data analysis and median fluorescence intensity  calculations were performed using flowjo . all fluorescence values were corrected by subtracting the mfi value of the secondary only goat anti-rabbit igg-alexa fluor  <dig> staining. cell viability of trypsinization protocols was evaluated by propidium iodide exclusion  and flow cytometry analysis . no difference in the percentage of dead cells within the pi-positive gate  was observed following either warm or cold trypsinization of pasmc.

pasmc were grown in ecm protein coated 10 cm cell culture plates until 80% confluence, serum starved and treated with 50 nm pma for 5 minutes or 20% fbs for 15 minutes at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  after stimulation the cells were washed twice with ice cold pbs before 300 μl ice-cold nonidet-p <dig>  lysis buffer was added and cells were scraped off the dish using a cell scraper and transferred to an eppendorf tube and kept on ice for 20 minutes. the samples were sonicated  <dig> times for 10 seconds and then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 minutes at 4°c. supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -20°c. the protein concentration was then determined by bca protein assay kit . xt sample buffer  was added to the samples and heated at 95°c for 10 minutes, cooled down and loaded onto nupage 10% bis-tris gels , and run for 50 minutes at  <dig> volts in nupage mops sds running buffer . proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride  transfer membrane  for 1 hour at  <dig> volts. the membrane was blocked in tbs/t  with 5%  dried skimmed milk powder. after blocking, the membrane was washed  <dig> times for 5 minutes in tbs/t. the membrane was then incubated with anti-perk primary antibody  at a dilution of 1: <dig>  the primary antibody was added in tbs/t with 5%  bsa and incubated over night at 4°c. the membrane was then washed  <dig> times for 5 minutes in tbs/t before staining with goat anti-rabbit igg -hrp conjugate 170– <dig>  secondary antibody at a dilution of 1: <dig> . the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody in tbs/t with 5%  dried skimmed milk powder for 1 hour at room temperature before being washed again,  <dig> times for 5 minutes with tbs/t. loading control was performed using monoclonal mouse anti-human smooth muscle actin clone 1a <dig>  with goat anti-mouse igg -hrp conjugate 170– <dig>  as secondary antibody. the membrane was developed in a chemi doc xrs  using pierce ecl western blotting substrate . quantification of western blot bands was conducted using the imagelab  <dig>  software . mean pixel intensity was measured for each band, background was subtracted and samples were normalized to beta-actin.

RESULTS
quantifying perk in single adherent cells by phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry
flow cytometry of adherent cells is routinely carried out by first detaching cells from tissue culture dishes or dissociating intact tissues by treating with the serine protease trypsin. trypsin is known to activate cell signaling via the protease-activator receptor  <dig> , a seven transmembrane-spanning domain g protein-coupled receptor, by cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain  <cit> . par <dig> activation stimulates map kinase pathway activity in epithelial and smooth muscle cells  <cit> . trypsin activation of par <dig> is also shown to activate map phosphatase activity and attenuate perk level induction by other receptors  <cit> . hence, trypsin can lead to both potentiated and attenuated perk levels induced by other receptors.

we reasoned that adherent cells could be prepared for phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry using a cold trypsin solution . trypsin remains nearly 50% active at 4°c, a temperature where intracellular kinases lack activity  <cit> . trypsinization of pasmc on ice  did not adversely affect cell viability , consistent with a previous report  <cit> . semiconfluent low passage pasmc cultures were stimulated with pma at  <dig> nm for 5 minutes, or with 20% fbs for 15 minutes and prepared for phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry analysis by trypsinization at 37°c or on ice. cells were kept on ice during the cold trypsin protocol in order to quench cell signaling. pasmc detached within 25 minutes on ice and within approximately 2 minutes at 37°c. detached pasmc were collected, fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol and stained with anti-perk1/ <dig>  antibody. stained cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine perk levels. in preliminary experiments we noted variation in perk levels following trypsinization at 37°c in unstimulated cell cultures, while basal perk levels remained low following trypsinization at on ice . this is in part due to the rapid detachment of pasmc at 37°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  pasmc treated with  <dig> nm pma and recovered by trypsin treatment at 37°c showed a  <dig> -fold increase in perk  as compared to the unstimulated cells . in contrast, perk levels in cells recovered by cold trypsin showed a  <dig> -fold increase following treatment with pma . relative perk activation was  <dig> -fold increase by 20% fbs treatment when trypsinized at 37°c  and  <dig> -fold increase by 20% fbs treatment with cold trypsin . in order to verify the specificity of the anti-phosphorylated erk signal detected by phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry, cells were pretreated with an inhibitor of the upstream map kinase mek <dig>  at 30 μm for 3 hours. pretreatment with pd <dig> inhibited perk activation in pasmcs stimulated with pma or serum stimulation . collectively, these results indicate that the cold trypsin phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry protocol is a preferable approach to measure cell signaling changes in adherent cells.

activation of the map kinase pathway is regulated by ecm
vascular smooth muscle cells  are normally surrounded by a laminin-rich basal lamina. during homeostatic or pathological vascular remodeling, vsmcs are exposed to dynamic changes in the local ecm, including loss of basement membrane and synthesis of new ecm components such as fibronectin, that can lead to vsmc proliferation, a major contributor to restenosis, vein graft thickening and atherosclerosis  <cit> . the laminin-rich basal lamina suppresses growth and promotes vsmc differentiation, while fibronectin transitional matrix deposited during vascular remodeling stimulate growth  <cit> .

to address the effect of different ecm proteins on map kinase signaling in vsmc, we cultured pasmcs on tissue culture plates coated with collagen i, fibronectin or laminin with growth factor  and serum supplemented culture medium. semiconfluent pasmc cultures were starved overnight and stimulated with pma or serum. western blot analysis of pasmc lysates  showed relative increases in both perk1/ <dig> bands at  <dig> and 44 kda, following treatment with pma or serum. in order to quantify these ecm-induced changes in map kinase pathway activation, we conducted the cold trypsin phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry analysis to measure perk levels. histogram plots of the anti-perk fluorescence  revealed a uniform increase in perk activation in pma and serum treated pasmcs cultured on different ecm. basal perk levels in pasmcs cultured on laminin were  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold less than pasmc cultured on collagen i or fibronectin respectively . treatment with pma or serum strongly activated perk under all conditions. compared to unstimulated cells , perk levels in cells cultured on tissue culture dishes with no coating were upregulated  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold when treated with pma  and serum  respectively. for cells growing on collagen i, treatment with pma and serum upregulated perk levels  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold . cells on fibronectin were upregulated  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold when treated with pma and serum respectively , while in cells grown on laminin-coated dishes the upregulation of perk levels were  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold when treated with pma  or serum  compared to the unstimulated cells . pasmc cells cultured on collagen and fibronectin display a nearly identical perk response profile to that of cells cultured on uncoated plates when normalized against unstimulated cells, while cells cultured on laminin displayed an increased relative perk responsiveness to pma stimulation .

CONCLUSIONS
exploiting the limited temperature dependence of trypsin facilitated development of a generally applicable phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry method facilitating cell signaling analysis in adherent cell types including primary patient derived cells. we demonstrate the utility of cold trypsin-phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry analysis of cell signaling to measure ecm influence in single adherent vsmc. our results indicate that vsmc adherence to laminin reduces basal perk levels consistent with suppressed growth, but maintain responsiveness to serum and pkc-dependent signaling.

flow cytometry analysis offers an attractive alternative to other approaches to multiparametric measurement of phosphorylation-dependent cell signaling events in adherent cells at single cell resolution, such as fluorescence scanning of arrayed cells or high content microscopy-based systems  <cit> . in particular, phosphorylation-specific flow cytometry offers superior quantification of phospho-epitopes detected by immunofluorescence  <cit> . as this sensitivity is achieved at the expense of cell morphological information, an integration of complementary flow cytometry and microscopy approaches is optimal.
