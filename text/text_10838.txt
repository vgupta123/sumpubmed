BACKGROUND
ng <dig> is a large transmembrane proteoglycan of the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan  family, with a large ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail  <cit> . it is expressed in many different tissues, especially during development, but in the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord, it is expressed predominantly by a subset of glial cells with astrocyte-like morphology and the antigenic characteristics of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  <cit> . these cells are present throughout white and grey matter at a density similar to that of oligodendrocytes and microglial cells, and in recent years it has been proposed that they constitute a novel class of glial cells  with as yet poorly understood roles in adult nervous system function  <cit> .

there is evidence from studies in vitro that ng <dig>  like most other cspgs, inhibits neurite outgrowth in culture  <cit> , and possesses several domains that cause growth cone collapse  <cit> . it has also been shown that antibodies against ng <dig> block its inhibitory effects on neurite growth  <cit>  and that among a variety of cspgs expressed by a growth-inhibitory astrocyte cell line, ng <dig> is the one with by far the strongest inhibitory effects on neurite growth  <cit> . this evidence is complemented by evidence, from in vivo studies, that ng <dig> is present at sites at which regenerative growth of axons within or into the cns is arrested, notably around cns injury sites and at the dorsal root entry zone , where ng2-expressing cells proliferate and accumulate after injury  <cit> ; see reviews by butt et al,  <dig>  <cit> , and nishiyama,  <dig>  <cit> .

findings such as these have led to a widespread belief that ng <dig> is one of the major inhibitors of axonal regeneration within or into the mammalian cns after injury  <cit> , a view that has been strongly reinforced by recent work reporting that neutralising monoclonal antibodies against ng <dig> applied at dorsal column lesion sites in adult rats, promote regeneration of sensory axons into the lesion site, and when combined with a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve, result in regenerative growth of axons rostral to the lesion site  <cit> .

however, in addition to abundant evidence for the presence in the cns of other molecules which are thought to inhibit regenerative axonal growth , there are numerous findings that cast doubt on the general validity of the view that ng <dig> is a major axon growth inhibitor and suggest the need for further investigation. for example, an <dig>  the mouse homologue of ng <dig>  does not inhibit outgrowth of mouse dorsal root ganglion  cell neurites growing on a laminin substrate  <cit>  and mouse cerebellar granule cells adhere to and extend neurites on substrates containing an <dig>  <cit> . also, whereas ng <dig> inhibits neurite outgrowth from rat cerebellar granule cells plated on a substrate of l <dig> , it has no effect on the outgrowth of neurites from drg cells on the same substrate  <cit>  suggesting that the inhibitory effects of ng <dig> are exerted selectively on only some types of neuron. there is also evidence that regenerating cns axons may grow through regions rich in ng2-expressing cells  <cit> . moreover, in very recent work, it has been shown that ng2-expressing cells promote neurite outgrowth from hippocampal and neocortical neurons in vitro and that both in vitro and in vivo ng2-expressing cells are preferentially and extensively contacted by axonal growth cones  <cit> , in keeping with earlier evidence that ng2-expressing cells may receive synaptic input from glutamatergic axons  <cit> .

the presence of ng <dig> in the normal and regenerating pns raises further questions about its roles. ng <dig> is expressed by fibroblast-like cells and microvascular pericytes in peripheral  <cit> , is present at nodes of ranvier  <cit>  and may also be expressed by a subset of non-myelinating schwann cells  <cit> . moreover, the peripheral axons of drg cells in the sciatic nerve regenerate through the prominent cap of ng2-positive cells that forms over the proximal stump following resection of the nerve, and continue to grow along the distal stump in close proximity to ng2-expressing cells  <cit> . such observations suggest that ng <dig> has no generalised inhibitory effect on regenerating pns axons or that it is involved in subtle focal inhibitory functions directed at preventing profuse branching of the axons and/or perhaps serving to confine regenerating axons to the bands of von büngner.

our approach to elucidating the possible roles of ng <dig> in inhibiting axonal regeneration after injury was to compare regeneration and reinnervation in a variety of well-established cns and pns injury models, between normal and ng <dig> knockout mice. thus we have studied axonal regeneration in the cns after lesions of the corticospinal tract and dorsal column, and at the dorsal root-spinal cord interface following dorsal root injury. we have also examined regeneration and reinnervation in peripheral nervous system following facial and sciatic nerve injuries.

RESULTS
analysis of phenotype
for all of the studies reported below, identification of knockout and wild-type mice was based on immunohistochemical phenotyping of tail snips with anti-ng <dig> antibody, which provided unequivocal evidence for the absence or presence of ng <dig> . no differences were apparent between knockout and wild-type mice with respect to appearance, behaviour, weight or gross features of brain and spinal cord.

cns injury models
dorsal column injury
following dorsal column lesions  no differences were apparent at autopsy or in overall histological appearance of the lesion site or other areas of cns tissue, between knockout and wild-type mice. in all cases the dorsal column above and below the lesion site was separated by a zone of collagenous connective tissue  which was adherent to the overlying meningeal tissue and was often lost during tissue processing, leaving a cyst-like cavity.

in both knockout and wild-type mice surviving  <dig> days after transection of the dorsal column at t <dig> , axons labelled transganglionically with ct-hrp were present in the dorsal column below the level of the lesion , but with the exception of a small number of axons which appeared to penetrate into the most caudal region of the lesion , labelled axons were not detected at more rostral levels . furthermore, most of the labelled axons at the caudal margin of the lesion displayed enlarged end-bulbs suggesting arrested regeneration at this level. systematic examination of serial sections showed no labelled axons growing around the lesion or bypassing it ventrally.

dorsal root injury
in both knockout and wild-type mice  <dig> days after l <dig> dorsal root transection  labelled axons  were present in the dorsal root central to the injury site. however, the great majority appeared to be arrested at the drez where some formed end-bulbs  and some appeared to turn back into the root . no labelled axons were detected in the dorsal column or dorsal column nuclei  in either knockout or wild-type animals.

corticospinal tract injury
twenty-one days after transection of the dorsal column  at c <dig> and anterograde labelling of cst axons with bda injected into the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, labelled axons were abundant in the cst rostral to the injury site but appeared to be arrested at the rostral border of the latter in both wild-type  and knockout mice . many of the labelled axons displayed terminal end-bulbs in this area. no labelled axons penetrated the lesion site, none was observed bypassing the lesion site laterally or ventrally, none was found in the dorsal part of cst caudal to the lesion site, and there was no evidence to suggest that axons in the injured cst had grown or sent branches into the intact contralateral cst in either group. fine lateral branches were observed to emerge from labelled cst axons rostral to the lesion site  but these were as likely to have been normal collateral branches as regenerative sprouts and no difference in the distribution or frequency of such side branches was detected between knockout and wild-type mice.

functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury
sciatic nerve crush and transection
recovery of sensory function, as a measure of the rate and extent of regeneration of sensory axons in the injured sciatic nerve, was assessed by twice-daily monitoring of the withdrawal reflex in response to stimulation of the lateral hindpaw with von frey hairs from  <dig> day following nerve injury to  <dig> days after full recovery was first observed. the threshold stimulus for eliciting withdrawal was identical for both hindpaws preoperatively and for the control hindpaw postoperatively in both wild-type and knockout mice. after sciatic nerve crush, wild-type mice recovered the preoperative withdrawal reflex threshold after a mean of  <dig>  days and knockout mice after a mean of  <dig>  days . after simultaneous excision of  <dig> mm of the saphenous nerve, recovery times were not significantly different: the withdrawal reflex was restored by  <dig>  days in wild-type mice and by  <dig>  days in knockout mice ; fig. 5b). these results confirm that recovery times after sciatic nerve injury alone could not be due to reinnervation as a result of sprouting from branches of the saphenous nerve, which, if it occurred, might give rise to false positive results. after sciatic nerve section and reanastamosis, which presents a greater barrier to regeneration than crush injury, recovery times were  <dig>  days on average for wild-type and  <dig>  days for knockout mice .

recovery of motor function, as a measure of the rate and extent of regeneration of motor axons in the injured sciatic nerve, was assessed at the same time that sensory function was tested, by recording the toe spreading reflex when the hindpaw is raised above the supporting surface . the toe spreading reflex was restored, on average, at  <dig>  days in wild-type and  <dig>  days in knockout mice after sciatic nerve crush  and at  <dig>  versus  <dig>  days after simultaneous sciatic nerve crush and saphenous nerve resection . after sciatic nerve transection and reanastamosis, the toe-spreading reflex recovered on average after  <dig>  days in the wild-type versus  <dig>  days in the knockout mice, but this apparent 3-day lag in recovery of knockout mice was not statistically significant .

facial nerve crush
recovery of motor function after facial nerve crush was assessed twice daily, from  <dig> to  <dig> days postoperatively, by monitoring spontaneous whisker twitching and the corneal blink reflex. whisker twitch took, on average,  <dig>  days to recover in the  <dig> wild-type animals and  <dig>  days in the  <dig> knockout animals , with the corneal reflex recovering in  <dig>  days versus  <dig>  days . thus there was no significant difference between wild-type and knockout mice with respect to regeneration of facial nerve axons .

anatomical studies after peripheral nerve injury
retrograde labelling of drg cells
the number of drg cells with axons that had regenerated into the glabrous skin of the hindpaw at various time points following sciatic nerve crush was determined by retrograde labelling with diasp to provide information on both the extent and timing of reinnervation. di asp was injected two days prior to sacrifice, because it takes this time to be taken up by the axons and retrogradely transported in sufficient quantity to fill the neuronal cell bodies. because of variable uptake of diasp after injection into the hindpaw and variability in the intensity of neuronal cell body labelling, the threshold for identifying  labelled cells was set at a relatively high level. the numbers of labelled cells recorded may therefore represent gross underestimates of the actual number of drg cells with regenerated axons. in all cases both feet were injected with diasp, and counts of labelled cells were made in both ipsilateral and contralateral l <dig> and l <dig> drg as a control for inter-animal variability in uptake of diasp.

at  <dig> and  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush , the contralateral drg were heavily labelled but there were no labelled cells in ipsilateral l <dig> or l <dig> drg  indicating that the crush lesions were complete, that l <dig> and l <dig> drg are not labelled via routes other than injured sciatic nerve, and that regenerating sensory axons had not reached the hindpaw at these survival times. very few labelled neurons were present in the ipsilateral drg  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush , in either wild-type or knockout mice, with an average of  <dig> labelled neurons per drg in wild-type mice compared to  <dig> in knockout mice . the appearance of retrograde label in injured drg neurons  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush, but not before, correlates with the onset of functional recovery being 9– <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush in our other experiments .

much larger numbers of labelled drg cells were present  <dig> days after injury, averaging  <dig> per drg in the wild-type mice and  <dig> in the knockout mice . thus, differences between wild-type and knockout mice groups were not significant at either  <dig> or  <dig> days after injury.

there were no significant differences in the numbers of retrogradely labelled drg cells in the l4/ <dig> drg on the control side between wild-type and knockout mice at either  <dig> days ; on average  <dig> labelled neurons in the wild-type and  <dig> in the knockout; p =  <dig> ) or at  <dig> days . the marked phenotype-independent difference in the number of labelled neurons in the contralateral  l <dig> and l <dig> drg at  <dig> days versus  <dig> days was, however, a consistent and unexpected finding. a possible explanation for this may be that diasp is a more effective retrograde label for drg cells in mature animals than in young ones.

reinnervation of denervated endplates in the soleus muscle
the progress and extent of muscle reinnervation  <dig> and  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush was examined by light microscopy, using silver-cholinesterase histochemistry. endplates in control soleus muscle from both wild-type and knockout mice were almost all innervated by a single axon . at  <dig> days after injury no endplates had been reinnervated in either group . at  <dig> days, however, there was extensive reinnervation of endplates in both wild-type  and knockout mice  and no consistent differences in the appearance of the endplates were observed between the two groups. the mean percentage of non-innervated endplates at  <dig> days was  <dig> % in wild-type and  <dig> % in knockout mice  and the proportion of endplates reinnervated by a single axon was  <dig> % in wild-type and  <dig>  % in knockout mice , the proportion of polyinnervated endplates  was not significantly different between the two groups .

sensory reinnervation of hindpaw glabrous skin
the extent of sensory reinnervation of the glabrous skin of the hindpaw was assessed at  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush by light microscopy after immunostaining for pgp  <dig> . no differences were observed between wild-type and knockout animals on the control or injured side . in the sampled microscope fields  the mean number of immunostained  sensory axons in the dermis was  <dig> for the wild-type group and  <dig> for the knockout animals . there was an apparent difference between the wild-type and knockout animals with respect to pgp  <dig> -positive nerve fibres in the uninjured hindpaw where a mean of  <dig> axons was counted in the wild-type versus  <dig> in the knockout, but this finding was based on only  <dig> animals per group, and significance could not be reliably established .

axon counts in digital nerves after sciatic nerve crush
ultrathin sections of the digital nerves in the fourth toe distal to a sciatic nerve crush were analysed by electron microscopy  <dig> and  <dig> days after a sciatic nerve crush to compare numbers of regenerating unmyelinated and myelinated axons . there were no gross morphological differences in the ultrastructure of the digital nerves of wild-type and knockout mice  <dig> days after a sciatic nerve crush. all axons were unmyelinated and the mean number counted in the dorsal digital nerves of wild-type mice was  <dig>   compared to a mean of  <dig>  axons in the knockout mice  . in the mice surviving  <dig> days after sciatic nerve crush, premyelinating axons  and remyelinating axons  were counted in all digital nerves  of the ipsilateral fourth toe. wild-type mice had a mean of  <dig>   myelinated axons in the 4th toe digital nerve  compared to a mean of  <dig>  axons  in the knockout mice . in summary, the regenerative growth of sensory axons into digital nerves after sciatic nerve crush appears to be unaffected by the ng <dig> null mutation.

axon counts in the tibial nerve after sciatic nerve crush
transverse sections of the tibial nerve  <dig> mm distal to a sciatic nerve crush injury site were analysed  <dig> days after injury. the mean number of myelinated axons in wild-type mice was  <dig>  compared to  <dig> in knockout mice. estimates of the surface area of the wild-type and knockout tibial nerve cross sections were sufficiently similar to suggest that overall size differences in the nerve cross sections were unlikely to be a confounding factor in the numerical estimates. the difference in the number of regenerating myelinated axons between wild-type and knockout animals was not statistically significant .

facial motor nucleus neuron counts after facial nerve injury
the numbers of facial nucleus neurons retrogradely labelled with fluorogold  applied to the whisker pad  <dig> days after facial nerve transection and  <dig> days before the animals were killed, were determined in  <dig> wild-type and  <dig> knockout mice . the mean number of labelled neurons in the wild-type mice was  <dig>  and in knockout mice was  <dig>  .

in order to confirm that retrograde label was being uptaken sufficiently, a further  <dig> wild-type and  <dig> knockout mice received diasp  <dig> days after facial nerve transection . wild-type mice had a mean of  <dig>  labelled neurons and the knockout mice a mean of  <dig>  labelled neurons .

similarly, the numbers of facial nucleus neurons retrogradely labelled with diasp applied to the whisker pad  <dig> days after facial nerve crush  and  <dig> days before the animals were killed, were determined in three of the wild-type and three of the knockout mice used for assessing functional recovery . the mean number of labelled neurons in wild-type mice was  <dig> and in knockout mice was  <dig> . this difference could not be tested for statistical significance because of the small number of animals included in these groups .

the fact that there were apparently more diasp-labelled neurons in the knockout mice than in the wild-type mice after facial nerve transection, but more in the wild-type than in the knockout mice in the facial nerve crush group further suggests that the difference between wild-type and knockout animals in the crush group was not significant and reinforces the conclusion that the absence of ng <dig> in the knockout mice has no detectable effect on the regeneration of axotomised facial nerve axons.

these findings are entirely consistent with those obtained with fg, thus strengthening confidence in diasp-based results. the control side facial nucleus had a mean of  <dig>  neurons labelled with fg in the wild-type mice and  <dig> neurons labelled in the knockout mice , suggesting that there was very little variability in fg uptake or retrograde transport of fg .

discussion
the major findings
the role of ng <dig> in the injured nervous system is controversial. although ng <dig>  a molecule widely regarded as a potent inhibitor of axonal regeneration, is strongly expressed at injury sites in the cns, where regeneration is abortive, it is also strongly expressed in injured peripheral nerves, where axonal regeneration is vigorous . it might have been expected, therefore, that the absence of ng <dig> would enhance axonal regeneration in the cns and/or reduce regeneration in peripheral nerves. our findings were consistent and in some respects surprising: the absence of ng <dig> had no effect on axonal regeneration in vivo. specifically, we could find no evidence that regenerative growth of dorsal root axons into the spinal cord after dorsal root injury, or of ascending  axons within the spinal cord following dorsal column injury, was enhanced in the ng <dig> knockout mice. similarly, descending corticospinal tract axons failed to show enhanced regeneration in ng <dig> knockout mice following spinal cord injury. in addition, we have shown, by quantitative methods and for the first time, that sciatic nerve fibres, both motor and sensory, and facial  nerve fibres, regenerated and re-established functional innervation of target tissues to the same extent and at the same speed in the ng <dig> knockout and wild-type groups.

because there is evidence that neurons may vary in their sensitivity to ng <dig>  it is important that we have examined regeneration in a number of models. two different populations of projection axons within the spinal cord , dorsal root axons at the pns/cns interface, and motor and sensory axons of two peripheral nerves  were all tested for possible effects of the absence of ng <dig> on regeneration after axotomy. furthermore, in the case of the injured peripheral nerve, different types of lesion were examined, and both functional and multiple types of anatomical analyses of regeneration were carried out. in all of the systems and experimental conditions tested we found only insignificant differences between ng2-deficient and normal animals. we therefore conclude that: i) ng <dig>  on its own, does not exert a profound influence on the regenerative growth of peripheral nerve fibres; and ii) absence of ng <dig> from the microenvironment of the cns does not enhance the regenerative growth of injured axons or facilitate the entry of regenerating dorsal root axons into the cns even when the regenerative potential of the drg cells is enhanced by a conditioning lesion. in other words, ng <dig> cannot be viewed as a major cause of failure of axonal regeneration within or into the cns. the latter conclusion is entirely in keeping with the recent findings of de castro et al.  <cit> , who carried out closely related studies on ng <dig> knockout mice. they transected the spinal cord at vertebral level t9/ <dig> and found that the penetration of immunohistochemically visualised cgrp-containing  into the ng2-rich scar tissue at the transection site was no more extensive in the knockout mice than in the wild-type controls, and that penetration into the scar tissue of serotoninergic  axons was greater in the wild-type than in the knockout mice.

our findings and conclusions are also in line with other evidence that ng <dig> is neither a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the cns nor a promoter of longitudinal regeneration in peripheral nerves. this includes the recent work of yang et al.  <cit>  which provides some of the strongest and most direct in vitro evidence that ng2-expressing cells do not inhibit or repel growing/regenerating neurites, and indeed provides both in vitro and in vivo data suggesting the opposite, albeit based heavily on cns neurons derived from neonatal rather than mature animals .

ng <dig> as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the cns
a number of previous in vivo studies have suggested that ng <dig> and other cspgs play an important part in limiting axonal regeneration in the cns. ng <dig> is the most strongly upregulated cspg at cns injury sites, with a time course very closely matched to the arrested growth of axonal sprouts  <cit> , and enzymatic degradation of cspgs  promotes regenerative axonal growth in the adult cns  <cit> . however, such enzymatic degradation is not specific to ng <dig> and will affect many other molecules with potential axon growth inhibiting properties and it is relevant that there are strongly inhibitory domains in the ng <dig> core protein which would be unaffected by treatment with chondroitinase abc  <cit> . more recently, tan et al.,  <cit>  have described more direct evidence that ng <dig> is involved in inhibiting cns regeneration by well controlled studies of regenerative growth of transganglionically ctb-labelled dorsal column axons at thoracic cord transection lesion sites in young adult rats. they demonstrated a convincing enhancement of growth into  the lesion site, when ng <dig> was neutralised with function-blocking monoclonal antibodies applied directly at the lesion site, especially when the drg neurons were primed with a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve. we recognise that the work of tan et al. provides a strong challenge to the conclusion de castro et al. and we have reached on the basis of our studies of ng <dig> knockout mice. a possible explanation of the effects of the antibody reported in the study of tan et al. is that they may have resulted from modulation of the behaviour of ng2-expressing cells or cell complexes, rather than by direct blocking of axon/ng <dig> interactions.

ng <dig> as a facilitator of regeneration in peripheral nerves
whether or not ng <dig> has an insignificant role in preventing axonal regeneration in the cns – as our findings suggest – or is a contributory factor in this process, ng <dig> is upregulated in vigorously regenerating peripheral. hence it may be that ng <dig> has facilitatory roles with respect to axonal regeneration, especially in the pns where it has been suggested that ng <dig> may promote enhanced mobility of non-neuronal cells after injury, thereby aiding the formation of cellular  bridges to act as a supportive substrate for regenerating axons  <cit> . we have also previously suggested, based on its distribution within normal and injured peripheral nerve, that a plausible role for ng <dig> might be to facilitate regeneration by helping to confine regenerating axons within the endoneurial compartment and/or within the bands of von büngner of the distal stump  <cit> . however, our finding that regeneration of sensory and motor axons in peripheral nerves is not reduced or delayed in ng <dig> knockout mice suggests that any such effects are of very minor significance for peripheral nerve regeneration.

potential confounding factors
it is pertinent to consider why the absence from the transgenic mice of ng <dig>  a molecule with powerful effects in vitro, had so little effect on axonal regeneration in vivo. first, it is possible that ng <dig> has a redundant role in this process since ng <dig> is only one of a number of potential growth inhibitory or repulsive molecules at injury sites in the nervous system. for example, ng <dig>  tenascin-c and cspgs other than ng <dig> are expressed in similar regions of lesion sites in spinal cord  and peripheral nerves   <cit> . it would be interesting to analyse with immunohistochemistry whether these molecules are upregulated in the ng <dig> ko mice compared to wild-type mice in the tissues studied.

second, elimination of the ng <dig> gene may have induced upregulation of other molecules with similar functions during development, thus further compensating for any effects of the absence of ng <dig> in the knockout animals. conditional knockout and/or knockdown experiments  would be necessary to test this hypothesis.

third, it is also possible that the neuronal populations investigated in this study were particularly insensitive to ng <dig>  it is known that neuronal populations differ in their responsiveness to ng <dig> in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> , and it is conceivable that  the neuronal populations we examined do not normally express receptors for ng <dig> and are thus intrinsically less responsive to ng <dig> than other populations. however, among neuronal types that have been reported to show inhibition of neurite growth in the presence of ng <dig> are drg cells  <cit>  and neocortical neurons . this and the fact that we tested several types of neurons make it extremely unlikely that our findings are not generally applicable. it is also possible that age is a relevant factor when considering the negative findings in our study. thus we used adult animals and studied regeneration in vivo whereas much of the data suggesting inhibitory effects of ng <dig> on axonal growth derive from in vitro studies using embryonic or neonatal neurons: for example, embryonic or neonatal rat  drg neurons  <cit> ; rat e <dig> cortical neurons  <cit> ; e24- <dig> chick retinal ganglion cells  <cit> ; and early postnatal rat cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . inhibition by ng <dig> of regenerative axonal growth from adult neurons has not been directly demonstrated, and it would not be surprising if developing neurons differed significantly from their adult counterparts with respect to their responsiveness to ng <dig>  however, in view of the body of  evidence favouring a role for ng <dig> in inhibiting axonal regeneration in the adult cns , our failure to find evidence for such a role of ng <dig> is unlikely to be explicable solely in terms of the age/maturity of our experimental animals.

experiments on mice lacking the putative myelin-derived inhibitory molecule nogo-a have also failed to show consistent enhancement of axonal regeneration after injury  <cit> , even though treatment with nogo-a-blocking antibodies increase sprouting and regeneration of injured corticospinal neurons  <cit> . similarly, genetically inactivating the nogo receptor  failed to produce significant regeneration of one class of axon  that express the receptor strongly  <cit> , whereas subcutaneous administration of the ngr antagonist nep1- <dig> enhanced regeneration of corticospinal axons  <cit> . the reason for the discrepancy between genetic and pharmacological inactivation of both nogo and ngr is not clear  <cit> . part of the lack of effect of knocking out ng <dig> may have been due to the genetic background of the mice we studied- c57bl/ <dig>  genetic background can have considerable effects on axonal regeneration in strains of transgenic mice. recently dimou et al.  <cit>  showed that corticospinal axons regenerated less well in nogo-a knockout mice with a c57bl/ <dig> background  than in knockout mice with a 129x1/svj background, a finding that may be produced by a weaker intrinsic regenerative response by neurons from the c57bl/ <dig> strain. none the less, c57bl/ <dig> mice can regenerate axons vigorously following peripheral nerve injury and intrinsic cns neurons from such animals can regenerate axons into peripheral nerve implants in the brain . if ng <dig> was the major factor preventing axonal regeneration in the spinal cord of c57bl/ <dig> mice, some enhancement of regeneration in the knockout animals would have been expected.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies suggest that ng <dig> is not a major inhibitory molecule preventing regeneration in the cns and, further, that it is not essential for successful axonal pathfinding, regeneration and functional reinnervation in injured peripheral nerves. it is conceivable that if cns regeneration-promoting interventions such as enhancing the intrinsic regenerative ability of cns neurons, expressing neurotrophic molecules to support regenerating axons and neutralising other putative inhibitory molecules were to be applied, ng <dig> knockout mice would show enhanced regeneration relative to wild-type mice. however, such studies have not yet been carried out and for the moment the evidence that ng <dig> is not a key inhibitor of axon regeneration appears to be very strong.
