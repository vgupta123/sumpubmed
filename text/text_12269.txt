BACKGROUND
how many genes are truly involved in the response of organism to a challenge such as pathogen infection, and what are the roles of those genes? global assays of gene expression, for example by microarray analysis, are typically conducted to test the hypothesis that a small, defined set of genes are responsible for an organism's response to some challenge. gene expression changes below a certain threshold  are often disregarded as being irrelevant and/or unreliable. a major challenge in evaluating the importance of low magnitude transcriptional changes is that the level of replication used in a typical microarray experiment is insufficient to detect small changes given the technical and biological variability in the system. although several methods appear to be promising for precise quantification of gene expression, it remains uncertain what constitutes a significant change in response to treatments  <cit> .

high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as affymetrix genechips can detect up to 90% of all the mrnas in a transcriptome  <cit> . for example, nearly 90% of all yeast mrnas could be detected in cells grown under both rich and minimal media growth conditions, with approximately 50% being present at average levels between  <dig>  and  <dig> copy per cell  <cit> . of the  <dig>  genes on affymetrix rat genomic  <dig>  <dig>  genechip microarrays,  <dig>   could be detected in growing rat bone  <cit> . in a study with human abdominal aortic aneurysms, of the  <dig>  genes common to affymetrix and illumina arrays,  <dig>   were expressed in either aneurysmal or normal abdominal aorta  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  of the soybean genes  on the affymetrix genechip could be detected in soybean cyst nematode -colonized root pieces <cit> .

markedly varied numbers of genes, from only a few up to several thousands, have been reported to be differentially expressed in response to diverse challenges, depending on the system and the statistical methodology. for instance, of the approximately  <dig>  protein-encoding genes in the saccharomyces cerevisiae  genome, over  <dig>  showed significant changes in mrna levels during sporulation  <cit> . in rat,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  expressed genes  had a significant change in gene expression during growth, about half up-regulated and half down-regulated  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> out of approximately  <dig>  genes showed a statistically significant response to cold stress, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated  <cit> .

one of the most profound challenges an organism can suffer is pathogen infection. in a meta-analysis of  <dig> studies involving  <dig> transcriptomic experiments with  <dig> different host-pathogen interactions  <cit> ,  <dig> human genes showed transcriptional changes in response to at least one challenge, and a cluster of  <dig> co-regulated genes was identified as representing a common infection response. during infection of the plant arabidopsis by the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae, approximately  <dig>  of the approximately  <dig>  genes monitored showed significant expression level changes  <cit> . in soybean, the affymetrix genechip has been used to profile gene expression during infection with soybean rust fungus and soybean cyst nematode   <cit> . during nematode infection,  <dig> of  <dig> soybean transcripts , while  <dig> out of  <dig> scn genes  showed expression changes  <cit> .

to identify genes involved in the responses of several soybean genotypes to infection by the oomycete pathogen phytophthora sojae, we conducted a very large-scale microarray experiment using affymetrix genechips. three soybean genotypes  were included within each of the  <dig> experimental blocks. replicates of each set of the three genotypes, incubated in the same growth chamber, were harvested at three different times . for each soybean line, approximately  <dig> seedlings were inoculated on the roots with p. sojae and after  <dig> days,  <dig>  mm root segments were collected from immediately above and below the upper margin of the visible lesion . from approximately  <dig> mock-inoculated plants,  <dig> mm root segments  were collected from positions on the roots matching the lesions on the pathogen-inoculated plants. rna was extracted from each of the samples, labeled and hybridized to affymetrix soybean genechips. this paper reports our analyses of a total of  <dig> genechips with the samples obtained from  <dig> blocks from which a full set of  <dig> successful microarray assays were obtained.

RESULTS
the entire soybean transcriptome is significantly remodeled by genotypic differences and phytophthora infection
the primary genechip data were pre-processed using gc-rma background correction, quantile normalization and median polish summarization. to identify factors that significantly affected expression of individual genes, linear mixed-model analysis  was used, and three methods to control the false discovery rate  were employed.

lmma indicated that 89% of the detectable genes  were significantly affected by infection in both the upper and lower infection courts, even when using the most conservative fdr method  at a level of  <dig>  . with the least conservative method  at a level of  <dig> ,  <dig> % of the detectable genes were identified as significantly affected. the analysis also identified very large numbers of genes whose transcription level was significantly affected by genotype. for instance, at moderate stringency ,  <dig>  genes  showed significant expression differences among the three soybean lines. furthermore,  <dig>   showed a genotype-sensitive response to infection . genes showing significant responses to infection and/or infection × genotype interaction constituted  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the detectable transcriptome . genes showing significant responses to genotype and/or infection × genotype interaction constituted  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the detectable transcriptome . the experiment was also able to identify a large number of genes that responded significantly to the subtle differences in the times of harvest  , although as expected this number was smaller than the overall response to infection and genotype.

to verify that our statistical analysis was effectively controlling false discovery, we separated the  <dig> blocks into two "sub-groups" consisting of odd-numbered and even-numbered blocks respectively. we then included the effect of sub-group in our linear mixed model and used lmma to identify genes showing significant differences between the sub-groups. very few genes showed differences under even the most relaxed criteria , while at moderate criteria  none showed differences. similarly, when the  <dig> blocks were randomized into  <dig> sub-groups, each containing  <dig> blocks, only  <dig> genes showed significant differences among sub-groups . these small numbers of genes that show differences among sub-groups may reflect genes that are unusually sensitive to small variations in conditions used to assay the different biological replicates.

to verify that our results did not depend on the preprocessing methods , we preprocessed the genechip data with the bioconductor mas <dig> algorithm and re-analyzed the results by lmma. for the fixed factors, genotype, treatment, and genotype × treatment interaction, the agreement between the results of the two methods was between 92% and 98% at all levels of significance . for the time factor the agreement was less, but still at least  <dig> %.

transcriptional changes display both consistency and fluctuation
to assess to what extent the transcriptional changes we observed were biologically reproducible, we compared our results to those obtained from a pilot experiment carried out two years previously with cultivars v71- <dig> and sloan. that pilot experiment had a near identical design except that all plants were harvested at one time during the morning. also, the upper and lower infection courts were harvested together. to enable comparison with the  <dig> sample experiment, in which the upper and lower infection courts were harvested separately, the results from the upper and lower courts were averaged. the overall correlation in the expression changes measured for all genes by microarray analysis in the two experiments was very high  indicating a high level of reproducibility. even genes showing less than two-fold perturbations by infection showed excellent consistency between the two experiments. for example, in v71- <dig>  gma. <dig> .s1_at  was down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold in the two experiments, and in sloan down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold. as another example, gma. <dig> .s1_at  was up-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold in v71- <dig>  and down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold in sloan. in a third example, gmaaffx. <dig> .s1_at  was down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold in v71- <dig>  and down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold in sloan. only one measurement showed a statistically significant difference between the two experiments . this agreement is remarkable given that this is a two-organism interaction and that two experiments were conducted two years apart with different batches of soybean seed.

during the pilot experiment, transcript levels of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> housekeeping genes, were also measured by quantitative real-time pcr , using the same rna preparations as for the microarrays. for the  <dig> selected genes, the correlation between the microarray measurements from the two experiments was  <dig>   and the correlation between the microarray and qrt-pcr measurements was  <dig>    . in most cases, the agreement between the qrt-pcr results and the microarray results was very good. in only two cases  were statistically significant differences  observed between the qrt-pcr and the array results; possibly in these cases the two assay methods differed in their sensitivity to the presence of mrnas from close paralogs and homeologs of the assayed genes.

to further explore the biological reproducibility of the measured gene expression differences, we divided the  <dig> blocks into  <dig> sub-groups, each consisting of  <dig> consecutive blocks  and compared the results for each of the sub-groups for the same set of  <dig> genes . since the  <dig> blocks each constitute independent biological replicates spread over  <dig> months, each of the  <dig> sub-groups also constitute independent biological replicates. in most cases, only minor fluctuations were observed. two genes showed significant fluctuations .

comparing the power of large and small experiments
to compare the power of our experiment with experiments of a size comparable to those more commonly found in the literature, we again divided the  <dig> blocks into  <dig> sub-groups, each consisting of  <dig> consecutive blocks, and then reanalyzed the data by lmma for each sub-group separately. as expected, each individual data set had less power than the overall data set. an average of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % genes were detected as significant for genotype, treatment and genotype × treatment interaction, respectively, with tst-fdr control at a level of  <dig>  . however, different sub-experiments detected different subsets of the genes detected in the overall data set . thus genes significant in all the  <dig> sub-groups comprised only  <dig> % of those detected in the overall experiment . this lack of agreement among the gene lists became worse at more stringent  fdr levels. as is well-known, increased stringency produces more precise results  but at the expense of a sometimes major decrease in power, i.e. an increase in the number of false negatives. however, the union of all genes that were significant in any of the six sub-groups comprised  <dig> % of the genes with significant changes detected in the overall experiment . these results demonstrate that the most common error made with small experiments is false negatives, rather than false positives, and the common practice of combining results of multiple experiments by only considering the intersection of the gene lists is unnecessarily extremely conservative. a simple union, the techniques of meta-analysis, or where possible a joint analysis, may be most appropriate for combining data from multiple independent experiments.

low-magnitude transcriptomic remodeling differs among functional categories
many researchers use two-fold change as an arbitrary cutoff. our results show that  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the significantly changed genes in the upper infection court and  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the lower infection court changed by two-fold or greater in the three tested genotypes  . however,  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the genes with significantly changes showed only subtle changes . to examine the functional significance of gene expression changes of various magnitudes, we plotted the distribution of changes for genes in six functional categories relevant to infection, namely defense and disease, signal transduction, transcription, intracellular trafficking, cell structure and metabolism  . in the lower infection court of the susceptible cultivar, sloan, which had the greatest level of infection,  <dig>  genes showed significant changes in response to infection. compared to the entire set of modulated genes, the distribution of changes was significantly different for all six categories  . the disease and defense category and to a lesser extent metabolism showed a bias towards strongly up-regulated genes, whereas transcription and to a lesser extent signal transduction and intracellular trafficking, showed a bias towards down-regulation of genes. similar patterns were observed in the upper infection court of sloan and in both courts of the resistant cultivar v71- <dig> . to test if significant changes in distribution were present among genes showing low magnitude modulation, the distribution comparison was restricted to genes showing less than two-fold or less than  <dig> -fold modulation. five of the categories , and three categories , respectively, showed significantly different distributions from the overall gene set . even among genes with less than a  <dig> -fold change, those in the transcription and metabolism categories still showed significantly different distributions   .

athe fold changes were calculated by contrast analysis with sas proc mixed using gc-rma normalized data. "full" = full range from the greatest down-regulation to the greatest up-regulation; "±  <dig> x" = from down-regulated  <dig> x to up-regulated  <dig> x; "±  <dig> x" = from  <dig> x down-regulated to  <dig> x up-regulated; "±  <dig> x" = from - <dig> x down-regulated to  <dig> x up-regulated. bfunctional category of each gene drawn from annotation of the affymetrix soybean genechip by the goldberg group at the university of california, los angeles . cp-value obtained by resampling for the kolmogorov-smirnov test for distribution differences between a particular functional category and the whole gene set for genes with significant infection responses in the lower court of sloan; p values were adjusted for fdr by the tst method. results for other cultivars and infection courts are shown .

discussion
infection profoundly affects the physiology of host cells, including the levels of mrnas within each cell. the ability to measure changes in host mrna levels during infection is greatly limited by the intrinsic variability of the tissue and the difficulty of accurately reproducing infection across multiple replicates. as result, typical studies report significant changes in only a few percentage of the genes being assayed  <cit> . similar difficulties limit the power of many other experiments that measure transcriptional responses to genetic and physiological perturbations. here we have shown, by means of an experiment of unprecedented statistical power, that significant changes in the levels of nearly all host transcripts can be measured during infection of soybean with the eukaryotic pathogen phytophthora sojae. up to  <dig> % of the changes were greater than 2-fold in magnitude but the majority were of lower magnitude. up to 15% of the changes were less than  <dig> -fold in magnitude. similar widespread reprogramming of the transcriptome was also detected in response to genotypic differences among soybean cultivars, and even in response to different times of the day at which plants were harvested.

an experiment such as this, combining  <dig> biological replicates, each comprised of 20– <dig> plants, is very successful at identifying overall trends, in this case identifying overall responses to pathogen infection. in many of the individual genes we examined, the overall measurement also was a very good representation of a consistent response to infection observed across many independent experiments. on the other hand, some genes showed significant fluctuations from experiment to experiment. a major challenge in the future will be to design experiments that can dissect these changes and ask whether the fluctuations simply result from technical variations in the assay, whether the fluctuations result from small uncontrolled variations in the conditions in which the biological material is grown, or the more interesting possibility that fluctuations in mrna are a normal physiological event. it is possible for example that organisms have evolved the ability to tolerate significant changes in the levels of mrnas or other cellular components, and there is no evolutionary advantage to imposing extremely ranges on mrna levels.

by re-analyzing subsets of our data that represented the scale of replication more commonly found in microarray experiments , we showed that approximately half of the transcriptional changes that we detected could not be observed with the small-scale experiments. taking the intersection of six independent subsets greatly reduced the number of detected changes further, showing that this common practice for combining the results of multiple experiments is extremely and unnecessarily conservative. on the other hand, taking the union of multiple gene lists more closely approximated the results from the full-scale experiment.

a recent expression qtl study in saccharomyces cerevisiae showed variations in the levels of 79%, 69% and 47% of the detectable transcripts in response to treatment, genotype and treatment × genotype interactions respectively  <cit> . those findings, together with ours, suggest that widespread, low-magnitude transcriptional remodeling may be a normal process during physiological adaptation in eukaryotes, but one that is missed by conventional experimental designs. the extensive treatment × genotype interactions observed in both these studies suggest that the transcriptional reprogramming is genetically controlled.

the overall physiological response of an organism or cell to a stimulus may require coordinated changes in a wide array of cellular components. those changes in turn may require compensating or reinforcing changes in an even wider array of functionally-connected cellular components. as a result, understanding how a specific set of transcriptional changes relates causally to a physiological change at a whole system level, is a major challenge. our analysis suggests that low magnitude expression changes may be of functional significance. the observation that the patterns of low-magnitude transcriptional remodeling were significantly different among most functional categories, in some cases even among genes with less than 20% perturbation, is consistent with the hypothesis that low amplitude remodeling has functional significance. however, we cannot rule out that some percentage of genes may show low magnitude transcriptional modulation that has no functional significance, that is, they represent a low uncontrollable level of transcriptional variation that soybean  may have evolved to tolerate. interestingly, most of the transcriptional remodeling of defense and disease response genes was of high magnitude, while low-magnitude remodeling was widespread in the other functional categories. we speculate that strong transcriptional modulation of disease and defense-related genes is required for the host to directly engage the pathogen, while the numerous other genes that function in other categories are coordinately modulated to support or adjust to the direct response.

biological gene regulatory networks are highly interconnected systems. non-linear, synergistic interactions are common. large numbers of genes with low magnitude transcriptional modulation could potentially be just as important in conferring phenotypes and mediating physiological adaptation as the small numbers of genes that show large magnitude modulations. however, understanding the role of pervasive low magnitude remodeling may require using computational modeling approaches at a systems level, as well as improved technologies for accurately and cheaply measuring those changes. systems approaches will also be needed to develop a deeper understanding of how consistent small magnitude changes and stochastic fluctuations are integrated to produce phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings, consistent through two different normalization methods and two different statistical analysis procedures, suggest that almost the entire soybean genome undergoes significant transcriptional remodeling in response to pathogen infection and genetic variation. the majority of the transcriptional differences are less than two-fold in magnitude. the low amplitude modulation of gene expression  is highly statistically significant, even for modulations of less than 20%. these findings demonstrate that low amplitude transcriptional modulation forms an integral component of physiological adaptation in soybean, and, we speculate, in all eukaryotes.
