BACKGROUND
alpha1-adrenergic receptors  are members of the g-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. both pharmacological and molecular cloning studies have indicated the existence of multiple subtypes of α1-ars including α1a/c-ar, α1b-ar, and α1d-ar  <cit> . α1-ars play a key role in a variety of physiological processes, such as contraction of vascular and cardiac muscle, contraction of the spleen, liver glycogenesis, or melatonin secretion in the pineal gland  <cit> . activation of α1a-ar promotes hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes  <cit> . recently it has been shown that all three subtypes of α1-ar are also expressed in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells   <cit>  and their activation with norepinephrine stimulates migration, proliferation and protein synthesis  <cit> . however, norepinephrine increased smc hypertrophy, but not dna synthesis, through α1a-ar stimulation in uninjured aorta whereas norepinephrine stimulated proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts through the α1b-ar subtype  <cit> .

nonvascular fibroblasts, including cardiac fibroblasts  <cit> , generally do not express α1-ar and have been used for stable transfection of different subtypes of α1-ar to study their respective functions. however, a recent study showed the expression of a functional α1a-ar in primary tendon fibroblasts  <cit> . in rat- <dig> cells, a transformed cell line from embryonic fibroblast, expressing different subtypes of α1-ar, phenylephrine , an α1-ar agonist, activates phospholipase d and releases arachidonic acid  <cit> . however, unlike smc, activation of α1-ars in rat- <dig> cells also increases camp levels and pka activity  <cit> . α1a-ar is more efficiently coupled to phospholipase d activation, arachidonic acid release and camp than α1b-ar or α1d-ar in these cells  <cit> . activation of α1a-ar expressed in cos- <dig> and hela cells  <cit>  and α1b-ar or α1d-ar in cos and cho cells  <cit>  also increase camp levels. in hepg <dig> and m <dig> cells expressing α1b-ar, pe causes cell scattering and inhibits proliferation through activation of map kinases  <cit> .

the family of connective tissue cells includes fibroblasts, cartilage cells, bone cells, fat cells and smooth muscle cells. fibroblasts seem to be able to transform into any of other members of the family – in some cases reversibly – although it is not clear whether this is a property of a single type of fibroblast that is pluripotent or of a mixture of distinct types of fibroblasts with more restricted potentials. these transformations of connective tissue cell type are regulated by the composition of the surrounding extracellular matrix, by cell shape, and by hormones and growth factors  <cit> . heterologous expression of α1a-ars in cho cells inhibits basal and growth factor-stimulated dna synthesis, in contrast to the α1d-ar  <cit> . a recent study in the same model has reported camp as the mediator of the antiproliferative effect of α1a-ar stimulation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that activation of α1a-ar with pe in rat- <dig> cells affects their growth and/or differentiation status. to test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effect of pe and camp modulators on proliferation, growth and morphology in rat- <dig> cells expressing α1a-ars. moreover, we have examined the effect of pe and camp modulators on the expression of cell cycle regulators and muscle cell markers, because of the ability of fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts. our results show that activation of α1a-ars in rat- <dig> cells exerts profound effects promoting hypertrophy and expression of specific smooth muscle cell markers. we also show here that α1a-ar-induced cessation of dna synthesis is independent of camp and involves the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor, p27kip <dig> 

RESULTS
stimulation of α1a-ar inhibits dna synthesis at the g1/s checkpoint of the cell cycle in rat- <dig> fibroblasts
rat- <dig> fibroblasts stably transfected with α1a-ar expressed  <dig> ±  <dig> fmol/mg protein of receptors  <cit> . cells at 80% confluency were serum-deprived for  <dig> h in dmem and then incubated with pe  for different periods prior to the addition of thymidine. pe decreased basal thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum effect at  <dig> μm pe . reduction of basal dna synthesis was significant after  <dig> h of treatment with a maximum effect at  <dig> h of incubation with pe  . rat- <dig> fibroblasts stably transfected with α1a-ar incorporate thymidine in dna in a time-dependent manner , even after  <dig> h of serum-deprivation .

to determine whether pe at different concentrations delays the re-entry of rat- <dig> cells into the cell cycle, we examined the kinetics of cell cycle re-entry. flow cytometry studies showed that incubation of the rat- <dig> cells with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μm pe resulted in inhibition of the re-entry of  <dig>   <dig>  or 85%, respectively, of the cell population into the s phase of the cell cycle . therefore, stimulation of α1a-ar inhibits dna synthesis at the g1/s checkpoint in rat- <dig> fibroblasts.

cells were subjected to flow cytometric dna analysis as described in methods. different concentrations of pe inhibited the re-entry of the cell population into s phase of the cell cycle. data show the number of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. values are the mean ± s.e. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate on different batches of cells .

stimulation of α1a-ar increases protein synthesis and promotes hypertrophy in rat- <dig> fibroblasts
stimulation of α1-ars in vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit>  and in adult rat ventricular myocytes  <cit>  increases hypertrophy and protein synthesis. however, the α1-ar subtype mediating these effects is not known. exposure to  <dig> μm pe for  <dig> h increased leucine incorporation by 64%  and decreased basal thymidine uptake , as shown earlier in fig  <dig>  these effects were blocked by prazosin , an α1-ar antagonist. propranolol , a β-ar antagonist , or yohimbine , an α2-ar antagonist , had no effect on the decrease in basal thymidine or the increase in leucine incorporation in rat- <dig> cells caused by exposure to pe. these results show that pe stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits dna synthesis in rat- <dig> cells through activation of α1a-ars. the hypertrophy index, an indicator of cellular hypertrophy, is defined as the ratio of protein synthesis  to dna synthesis   <cit> . at  <dig> h, this ratio was  <dig>  fold as high in pe-treated cells  than in control cells , indicating that pe promotes rat- <dig> cell hypertrophy.

protein synthesis elicited by α1-ar stimulation was time-dependent and remained significant from  <dig> to  <dig> h of exposure with pe . egf and camp have opposite effects on rat- <dig> fibroblasts proliferation  <cit> . therefore, we tested the effect of egf and forskolin , an activator of adenylyl cyclase  <cit> , on protein and dna synthesis. egf  slightly increased, whereas fn decreased, leucine incorporation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h . surprisingly, pe was a better activator of protein synthesis than egf. in contrast, egf increased thymidine incorporation by 272% , an effect blocked by fn and the camp analog, 8-cpt-camp, as well as by pe.

pe inhibits dna synthesis and promotes hypertrophy by a mechanism independent of camp
previously, we have shown that pe induces camp accumulation in rat- <dig> cells  <cit> . it is also known that camp-dependent pka-mediated inhibition of cell division is due to blockade of growth factor-stimulated cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase  <cit> . therefore, to determine whether camp mediates the antiproliferative effect of pe, we examined the effect of fn  and 8-cpt-camp  and of fn and pe on dna synthesis in the presence and absence of adenylyl cyclase and pka inhibitors. fn and 8-cpt-camp inhibited thymidine incorporation to the same extent as pe . the fn but not the pe-induced decrease in thymidine incorporation was blunted by the selective inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase sq  <dig>  and by the p-site inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase 2',5'dideoxyadenosine, and 2'-deoxyadenosine 3'-monophosphate . the selectivity of camp modulators, fn, 8-cpt-camp and sq  <dig> has been tested previously in rat- <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . to further determine the contribution of camp pathway, rat- <dig> cells were transfected with πlxx-pki  <cit> , a vector that expresses the pka inhibitor, pki  <cit> . transfection with pki reversed the inhibitory effect of fn, but not that of pe, on thymidine incorporation in rat- <dig> cells . these observations indicate that camp and pka do not mediate the pe-induced inhibition of dna synthesis.

the antiproliferative effect of pe, fn and 8-cpt-camp could be the result of cell loss due to a cytotoxicity. however, the trypan blue exclusion test and ldh assay showed that more than 90% of cells were viable  and less than 1% of the cells were found in the supernatant, indicating very little cell loss.

cells were incubated for  <dig> h with pe , forskolin , 8-cpt-camp and 8-br-camp. the percentage of viable cells was calculated. values are representative of five different experiments.

morphological change elicited by α1a-ar stimulation and by camp in rat- <dig> cells
although both pe and fn inhibited dna synthesis in rat- <dig> cells, they produced different effects on cell morphology. pe increased, whereas fn decreased, the apparent size of rat- <dig> cells as shown in fig  <dig>  prazosin , an α1-ar antagonist, reversed the shape change produced by pe. to determine if pe-induced cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy of rat- <dig> fibroblasts is also independent of camp, we preincubated the cells with sq <dig>  and then treated them with pe  or fn  for different time periods. sq <dig> reversed the morphological changes produced by fn and restored the normal fibroblast shape, whereas it enhanced the effect of pe, i.e. the cells became more hypertrophic.

p27kip <dig> mediates pe-induced inhibition of dna synthesis
cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitors p27kip <dig> and p21cip1/waf <dig> play an important role in cell-cycle regulation  <cit> . high levels of p27kip <dig> and p21cip1/waf <dig> in quiescent  cells decline upon induction of mitogenesis  <cit> . this decrease in cdk inhibitors appears to be critical in enabling cell cycle entry. western blot analysis showed that α1a-ar stimulation increased the expression levels of p27kip <dig>  and p21cip1/waf <dig>  . the protein levels remained elevated for  <dig> h, with levels of p27kip <dig> reaching 389% of control at  <dig> h of incubation and remaining elevated for up to  <dig> h. this increase was concomitant with the inhibitory effect of pe on dna synthesis, which was also maximal at  <dig> h of incubation. pe increased the expression of p27kip <dig>  more efficiently than p21cip1/waf <dig> suggesting a greater contribution of p27kip <dig> to pe-induced cell cycle arrest and a delayed induction of p21cip1/waf <dig>  retinoblastoma protein  hyperphosphorylation and subsequent release of e2f is required for cell cycle progression  <cit> . however, α-ar stimulation of neonatal myocytes has been shown to induce prb hyperphosphorylation without induction of cell proliferation  <cit> . our results demonstrate that pe promotes an early increase in prb levels  in rat- <dig> cells , associated with a decrease in dna synthesis . the nuclear envelope proteins lamin a and c, used as control, were not altered by pe treatment .

in vsmc, p27kip <dig> level is a critical determinant of the cell response, hyperplasia vs. hypertrophy, to angiotensin ii and other growth factors  <cit> . we postulated that the response of rat- <dig> cells to pe was mediated by p27kip <dig>  pe upregulates the expression of p27kip <dig> at  <dig> h of treatment in rat- <dig> cells at all concentrations . we therefore explored further the role of p27kip <dig> in modulating the antiproliferative response of rat- <dig> cells to pe by transfecting these cells with p27kip <dig> antisense and sense odn. p27kip <dig> antisense , but not sense odn , diminished p27kip <dig> level  and blocked the antiproliferative effect of pe in rat- <dig> cells . these observations suggest that pe-induced inhibition of dna synthesis is mediated by p27kip <dig> 

pe increases the expression of cyclin d <dig>  proliferating cell nuclear antigen , cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> in rat- <dig> cells
we next investigated the effect of pe on several cell cycle proteins important for g1/s phase progression. fig.  <dig> shows that treatment of serum-deprived rat- <dig> cells with pe increased the levels of cyclin d <dig> , pcna , and cdk <dig>  in a time-dependent manner. the levels of nuclear envelope proteins lamin a and c, were not altered. these results are unexpected since pe promotes cell cycle arrest at g1/s checkpoint . however, the up-regulation of p27kip <dig> seems to be sufficient to block cell cycle entry into s phase and dna synthesis. surprisingly, we also observed an increase in the protein levels of cdk <dig> , which normally do not change even during mitogenic stimulation.

pe increases expression of specific smooth muscle differentiation markers as well as myod
cell cycle arrest is closely coupled to muscle cell differentiation and is required for activation of muscle cell specific gene expression  <cit> . since stimulation of α1a ars promoted a change in morphology associated with hypertrophy, we examined the effect of pe on expression of the specific smooth muscle cell markers, α-smooth muscle actin , caldesmon and myosin heavy chain   <cit> . the smooth muscle markers were not expressed in serum-deprived rat- <dig> cells . stimulation of α1a ars with pe  promoted a time-dependent increase in the levels of smα actin  , caldesmon   and sm-mhc   as shown by western blot analysis we also investigated the expression of myod, a helix-loop-helix protein that plays an important role in the regulation of muscle development  <cit> . western blot analysis showed that pe also increased the expression of myod in a time-dependent manner , further supporting the evidence that stimulation of α1a ar induces differentiation of rat- <dig> fibroblasts into muscle-like cells, which is closely coordinated with cell cycle arrest . the expression of vimentin, an intermediate filament protein used as a control, was not altered by treatment with pe . the α1a ar stimulation of smooth muscle differentiation markers was independent of camp because fn did not increase the expression of smα actin, caldesmon or sm-mhc . myod expression was not altered by fn . the level of vimentin expression was not altered by pe or fn . together, these data demonstrate that stimulation of α1aars increases expression of smooth muscle markers and myod in rat- <dig> cells, independently of camp.

discussion
this study is the first demonstration of the ability of an α1a-ar subtype to promote differentiation of a fibroblast into a smc/myocyte-like cell. further, it demonstrates that α1a-ar-induced cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy as well as differentiation is mediated through a mechanism dependent upon the increased expression of the critical cell cycle protein p27kip <dig> and selective smooth muscle markers.

stimulation of α1a-ars promotes hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes  <cit> . norepinephrine increases smc hypertrophy, but not cell proliferation, through α1a-ar stimulation in uninjured aorta  <cit> . in hepg <dig> and m <dig> cells transfected with α1a-ar, pe stimulates cell scattering and inhibition of proliferation  <cit> . similar observations have been made in cho cells expressing α1a-ars  <cit> . in the present study, pe inhibited cell proliferation, promoted hypertrophy and differentiation through stimulation of α1a-ars in rat- <dig> cells expressing this subtype. analysis of the effect of α1a-ar stimulation on cell cycle progression revealed that it inhibits the re-entry of cells from g0/g <dig> into the s phase of the cell cycle.

next we attempted to define the mechanism mediating α1a-ar-induced cell cycle arrest, hypertrophy and differentiation of rat- <dig> cells. previous studies have shown that in rat 1-cells expressing α1a-ars, pe promotes increase in camp accumulation and pka activation  <cit> . since camp has been reported to inhibit growth in various cell types, including cells of fibroblastic origin  <cit> , it seemed possible that camp mediates the inhibitory effect of pe on rat- <dig> cells proliferation. stable camp analogs or adenylyl cyclase activation promoted cell cycle arrest similar to α1a-ar stimulation. however, activation of the camp/pka pathway did not promote hypertrophy or differentiation of rat- <dig> cells. moreover, inhibition of camp/pka did not reverse the α1a-ar-induced inhibition of dna synthesis. therefore, α1a-ar-induced cell cycle arrest, hypertrophy and differentiation, is independent of the camp/pka pathway in rat- <dig> cells. recently, the camp pathway has been implicated in α1a-ar-induced cell cycle arrest in cho cells expressing α1a-ars  <cit> . the difference between these cell lines may be due to the inhibitory effect of pe on erk in rat- <dig> cells  <cit>  vs. pe-induced erk activation in cho cells  <cit> . in addition, the potential effect of α1a-ar stimulation on cho cells hypertrophy and differentiation is not known. during our investigation of the possible mechanism by which pe induces cell cycle arrest, we observed that although both pe and fn inhibited dna synthesis, these two agents produced remarkably different morphological changes in rat- <dig> cells. fn promoted a change in rat- <dig> cells to a small, shrinked, round shaped morphology whereas pe shifted the cells to a hypertrophied, enlarged and spindle shaped smooth muscle-like phenotype. this α1a-ar-induced morphological change was again independent of camp. differences between pe and camp on different cell functions are reported in table  <dig>  egf increases dna synthesis in rat- <dig> fibroblasts  <cit>  and slightly increased protein synthesis . however, egf was a far less potent hypertrophic agent than pe and did not change the morphology of rat- <dig> cells.

the arrows indicate a significant increase or decrease elicited by pe or fn in the corresponding cell parameter studied. these agents' stimulated camp production, decreased basal dna synthesis, and up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. pe and camp have opposite effects on protein synthesis, cell morphology and smooth muscle differentiation markers.

the different effects of α1a-ar stimulation and camp on rat- <dig> cell hypertrophy and morphology led us to explore the effects of pe and fn on different cell parameters associated with morphological changes, i.e. cell cycle regulators and smooth muscle cell differentiation markers. recently, it has been reported that the cdk inhibitor p27kip <dig> mediates angiotensin ii-induced cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy in cultured renal tubular cells  <cit> , and vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit>  and induces intestinal epithelial cell differentiation  <cit> . in the present study, stimulation of α1a-ars increased the expression of p27kip <dig> to a much greater extent than p21cip1/waf <dig>  suggesting an important role for the former cdk inhibitor in the action of α1a-ar stimulation. interestingly, the time of upregulation of p27kip <dig> by pe correlated closely with its effect on inhibition of dna synthesis, which was maximal at  <dig> h. depletion of p27kip <dig> prevented both pe-induced upregulation of p27kip <dig> and reversed pe-induced decrease in dna synthesis. therefore, p27kip <dig> plays a central role as a mediator of α1a-ar-induced inhibition of dna synthesis and probably hypertrophy and differentiation of rat- <dig> fibroblasts.

an important finding in the present study was that pe produced a change in the morphology of rat- <dig> cells characterized by an increase in cell size. supporting this phenotypic and hypertrophic change was our demonstration that pe increased global protein synthesis and the expression of markers specific to smooth muscle cells such as smooth muscle actin, caldesmon, and myosin heavy chain. the protein levels of these smooth muscle cell markers were found to remain elevated for up to  <dig> h, consistent with the pe-induced morphological change that persisted for the same time period. although stimulation of α1a-ars shifted rat- <dig> fibroblasts to smc/myocyte-like phenotype, it also increased the expression of the helix loop helix protein myod, a skeletal muscle-specific regulatory transcription factor  <cit> . surprisingly, pe also caused an increase in prb expression to a level similar to p27kip <dig>  myod has been shown to interact with prb and to promote muscle gene activation and cell cycle arrest  <cit> . indeed, prb has been found to contain a differentiation-promoting activity that is distinct from its cell-cycle progression functions  <cit> . more recent evidence has indicated an essential role for prb in promoting functional synergism between myod and mef <dig> proteins  <cit> . although pe increased the expression of myod in our study, the rat- <dig> cells had a smooth muscle/myocyte-like phenotype. it has been reported that vascular smooth muscle cells can spontaneously adopt the skeletal muscle phenotype  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that pe increases expression of myod in rat- <dig> cells during differentiation into myocyte-like cells. however, expression of myod is not sufficient for the coordinated program of skeletal myogenesis in smooth muscle cells  <cit> .

pe-induced hypertrophy and differentiation of rat- <dig> cells was also associated with increased levels of cell cycle proteins prb, cyclin d <dig>  pcna and cdk <dig> that are important for g1/s phase progression  <cit> . these data indicate that stimulation of α1a-ars promotes the transcriptional/translational activation of the machinery required for g1/s cell cycle progression. however, a simultaneous increase in cdk inhibitors such as p27kip <dig> prevented dna synthesis. elevation of p27kip <dig> protein level alone is sufficient for induction of cell cycle arrest, independent of cyclins or cdk level  <cit> . surprisingly, pe also increased the protein level of cdk <dig>  which is normally not affected by mitogenic stimuli. although the cdk inhibitors bind to cyclin/cdk complexes and reduce their activity, their interaction is probably much more complex  <cit> . cdk inhibitors may paradoxically activate these kinases, particularly cyclin d/cdk <dig>   <dig> complexes  <cit> .

the mechanism by which stimulation of the α1a-ar promotes the up-regulation of cdk inhibitors , smooth muscle cell markers, myod, and g1/s transition cell cycle proteins  leading to inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of hypertrophy and differentiation is not known. the camp/pka pathway was excluded by our results as well as the erk pathway  <cit> . the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and akt/pkb pathway, a pro-survival/mitogenic and hypertrophic pathway is also unlikely to be involved, because pe does not stimulate this pathway in rat- <dig> cells  <cit> . recently, a study on the genetic profiling of rat- <dig> fibroblasts expressing different subtypes of α-ar has shown that in cells expressing the α1a-ar, epinephrine  increased the gene expression of il- <dig>  gp- <dig>  and stat- <dig>   <cit> . moreover, in cells expressing α1a-adrenergic receptor, epinephrine also increased il- <dig> secretion and stat- <dig> ser <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that il- <dig>  gp <dig>  and/or stat- <dig> contributes to the upregulation of one or more of the cell cycle associated proteins and smooth muscle cell markers responsible for the cells arrest, hypertrophy and/or differentiation caused by α1a-ar activation in rat- <dig> cells.

with regard to functional significance in vivo, our model uses a transformed embryonic fibroblast cell line that expresses high levels of α1a-ar  <cit> . therefore, the relevance of these results to fibroblasts in tissues remains to be determined. these features in our model may underlie the ability of pe to cause expression of smc markers and myod through α1a-ar.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that stimulation of α1a-ars in rat- <dig> cells promotes cell cycle arrest by increasing levels of cdk inhibitors and promotes hypertrophy and differentiation into a phenotype having the characteristics of smooth muscle cells by a mechanism independent of camp or egf. moreover, cell cycle progression was blocked at g1/s transition without causing apoptosis, and this cycle arrest was critical for rat- <dig> cell hypertrophy and differentiation. reducing p27kip <dig> levels reversed α1a-ar-promoted inhibition of dna synthesis. furthermore, it shows that cell cycle arrest and differentiation are closely coordinated processes but temporally separable. further studies are underway in our laboratory to characterize the signaling pathway involved in α1a-ar-induced differentiation of fibroblasts to smooth muscle cells.
