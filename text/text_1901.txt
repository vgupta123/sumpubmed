BACKGROUND
elevated serum free fatty acids  and hepatic lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues can lead to cellular dysfunction or cell death, due in part to the diversion of unoxidized ffas to nonoxidative pathways, resulting in lipoapoptosis  <cit> . excess amounts of nonesterified ffas that fail to convert to triglyceride in liver cells, enhance the risk for hepatocellular lipoapoptosis, a pathogenic feature observed in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis   <cit> . the mechanisms involved in ffa-induced toxicity have remained unresolved, however recent studies suggest that hepatic lipoapoptosis arises predominantly from ffa-induced lipotoxic stress of intracellular organelles, in particular the endoplasmic reticulum  and mitochondria  <cit> .

the er is one of the largest organelles in the cells, and perturbing er homeostasis or inducing er stress has profound effects on cell survival. cellular perturbations, such as alterations in calcium storage in the er lumen or an imbalance in the luminal-oxidizing environment will cause er stress. this stress is sensed by the cells through three er transmembrane proteins, inositol requiring enzyme  1α, pkr-like er kinase , and activating transcription factor  6α  <cit> . they activate signaling processes to restore er homeostasis, and are collectively termed the unfolded protein response . upr signaling pathways coordinate cellular response by down-regulating protein translation, enhancing expression of er chaperone proteins that promote protein refolding, and activating proteases involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins. when these corrective actions are insufficient to attenuate er-stress, the upr switches to a pro-apoptotic mode. however, the mechanisms regulating er-stress-induced apoptosis have not been clearly defined.

of the er transmembrane proteins, perk is involved in regulating both translation and transcription to return the folding demand and capacity to homeostasis. like pkr , one of the eukaryotic translation inhibition factor 2α  kinases, perk  also phosphorylates eif2α at ser  <dig>  and phosphorylated eif2α impedes global translation initiation to decrease the protein load in the er  <cit> . however, activated eif2α paradoxically favors an increase in the translation of the activating transcription factor- <dig> , a member of the activating transcription factor/the camp-responsive element-binding protein  family of basic zipper-containing proteins  <cit> . atf <dig> binds to camp response element ) as a homodimer to induce transcription of many pro-survival genes that are involved in amino-acid metabolism, redox reactions, stress response and protein secretion  <cit> . under sustained er-stress, atf <dig> activates chop  transcription by binding to the ccaat/enhancer binding protein /atf response element  sequences, likely as heterodimers with members of the c/ebp family transcription factor. chop in turn inhibits the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig>  protein  <cit> . concomitantly, chop forms a heteromeric complex with the phosphorylated c-jun to bind the puma  promoter and contributes to the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins  <cit> .

saturated long chain-ffas, especially palmitic acid, have been implicated in er stress-induced apoptosis in liver cells  <cit> . since both transcriptional regulation and translational control of atf <dig> plays a central role on er stress-induced apoptosis, recent studies have focused on the regulation of the atf <dig> gene mediated by palmitate. in h4iie liver cells, a rat liver hepatoma cell line, palmitate has been shown to induce er stress, as evident by increased mrna levels of atf <dig>  <cit> . similarly human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, such as hepg <dig> cells, respond also to palmitate by elevating atf <dig> mrna and inducing er stress  <cit> . however, with the highly dynamic nature of upr signaling, it would be judicious to integrate signaling pathways which are involved in the regulation of atf <dig> and further elucidate the dynamics of the main signaling axis for er stress-induced apoptosis, perk/eif2α/atf <dig>  the complexity of the signaling pathways involved makes it difficult to experimentally test all possible interactions to determine which pathways in the signaling network are functional for a given condition. therefore, we applied a discrete dynamic network model to integrate potential interactions and components of er signaling and its feedbacks in hepg <dig> cells to gain a better understanding of how palmitate induces er stress in liver cells. the predictions are confirmed with further experiments.

RESULTS
the conventional signaling pathway  cannot explain the prolonged atf4-dependent er stress induced by palmitate in hepg <dig> cells
to evaluate the dynamics of the conventional er signaling pathway, we measured the protein expression levels of perk, eif2α, and atf <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hrs upon palmitate treatment. as shown in figure 1a, the phosphorylated protein levels of perk at ser  <dig> and eif2α at ser  <dig> were signficantly increased by palmitate treatment at  <dig>  24 hr and  <dig>  6 hr, respectively, while their total protein levels remained constant. palmitate transiently increased the phosphorylation levels of eif2α but induced a sustained increase in the protein expression level of atf <dig>  we note several discrepancies from the conventional signaling pathway. first, although eif2α is activated transiently by palmitate, atf <dig> continued to be strongly induced by palmitate, i.e. remained stably upregulated through 24 hrs . in support of our results, a recent study also observed similar trends in a time-course analysis of eif2α phosphorylation and atf <dig> protein expression in hepg <dig> cells treated with thapsigargine, an er calcium-atpase pump inhibitor that induces calcium release from the er  <cit> . the eif2α phosphorylation was transientlty activated by thapsigarine and reached a maxium at 30 min, while atf <dig> induction continued to rise for up to 8 hrs. however, it remains unclear why atf <dig> remained stably upregulated even though the level of eif2α phosphorylation was only transiently activated.

in addition, our group recently found that camp promoted apoptosis in palmitate-treated hepg <dig> cells, suggesting that camp-creb <dig> signaling may be involved in palmitate-mediated er stress  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that the phosphorylation of creb <dig> can be up-regulated by thapsigarine  in human glioma cells  <cit> . since atf <dig>  belongs to a family of atf/creb proteins, it raises a possibility that crosstalk exists between these two proteins during palmitate-induced er stress. therefore, we assessed whether the phosphorylation of creb <dig> in hepg <dig> cells is up-regulated upon palmitate treatment. as shown in figure  <dig>  the phosphorylation of creb <dig> was significantly induced by palmitate at all time points .

to resolve these discrepancies from the conventional pathway and incorporate our findings with the current knowledge, we collected and integrated information from the literature on palmitate-induced er stress signaling, with an emphasis on how atf <dig> could be activated by palmitate. we constructed a network of palmitate-induced signaling processes by collating the literature information . we formularized the signaling network into a discrete dynamic model. our discrete dynamic modeling approach was previously proposed and successfully applied to dissect the insulin signaling pathways in the same human liver cell system  <cit> . we applied this modeling and simulation method to the palmitate-treated cells , and integrated current knowledge to generate a signaling network, which was probed in silico to provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms involved.

pkr pathway is essential for eif2α phosphorylation in palmitate
our simulation results suggest plausible dynamic profiles of the network upon palmitate-stimulation . the simulations are based on current knowledge of the regulatory interactions between the components in the network. we initially assume that the activation steps  of the different components are at similar time scales. as shown in figure 4a, creb <dig> phosphorylation level was increased by palmitate over the simulation time, which matched the results obtained by western blotting analysis shown in figure  <dig>  however, the simulation results show that eif2α and atf <dig> were not activated by palmitate treatment , which is inconsistent with the experimental results of figure  <dig>  the in silico results suggest an inconsistency with the current knowledge of the palmitate-induced signaling processes mediated by eif2α and atf <dig> 

since pkr, another eif2α kinase, has been shown to be involved in atf4-dependent er stress in human embryonic kidney cells  <cit> , we questioned whether pkr is involved in eif2α phosphorylalion to regulate the pamitate-mediated atf <dig> protein expression in hepg <dig> cells. the experimental results suggest that pkr shows a prompt response at 3 h , while perk takes longer to be activated  . in addition, since pka -dependent protein kinase a) regulates creb <dig> phosphorylation both directly and indirectly )  <cit> , we measured the protein expression level of pka upon palmitate treatment. the catalytic subunits of pka, which plays an important role for pka activation, were significantly upregulated at 24 hr . thus we concluded that palmitate initiates signaling at different times through pkr , perk , and pka . we subsequently incorporated this new information into the discrete dynamic model, by imposing different delays in the palmitate-induced perk and pka activation. the resultant eif2α profile  matches the experimental observation  of a transient elevation in its phosphorylation level, which initiates the early er stress response. the network model thus suggests an important role of the different response time of pkr vs. perk in the regulation of the downstream effectors of palmitate. thus we hypothize that the prompt response of pkr could initiate the signal that activates the eif2α pathway.

creb <dig> may be involved in atf4-dependent er stress
another significant discrepancy between the in silico simulation and the experimental observation lies in the prolonged activation of atf <dig>  the experimental measurements  show that atf <dig> level is higher  at both 6 h and 24 h. such a prolonged activation cannot be explained by the model simulation where the atf <dig> level is reduced to lower than control at 24 h, although the initial upregualtion of atf <dig> in response to the upstream eif2α is captured by the model. the discrepancy suggests the downsteam feedback regulation of atf <dig> in the current model is incorrect in our liver cell system. the downstream feedback regulation in the model is mediated by phosphoprotein phosphatase  <dig> , which is known as a major regulator of atf <dig>  <cit> . we measured the level of phosphorylated pp <dig> at different times upon pa treatment and found that, in contrast to current knowledge of the atf <dig> pathway, there is no significant change on the activity of pp <dig>  in our system that could affect the atf <dig> level. the lack of involvement of pp <dig> explains in part the discrepancy between the current knowledge and our experimental observation of atf <dig> activation. indeed, when we updated our model with this new information of a constant pp <dig> level , the atf <dig> profile is no longer “inhibited” in the simulation . nevertheless, the simulations are still unable to capture the prolonged activation of atf <dig>  because there is no other regulators that connect to atf <dig> in the model to support its sustained activation after 6 h. this suggests that the current knowledge of the signaling process is incomplete and there should be other  regulatory relationship in the network that could lead to the accumulation of atf <dig> and finally lipoapoptosis.

creb <dig> is of the same family as atf <dig> and the phosphorylation of creb <dig> was significantly enhanced upon palmitate treatment . multiple cre binding sites  are identified on the atf <dig> and creb <dig> genes. both creb <dig> and atf <dig> proteins could bind the putative cre binding sites to enhance their gene expressions. thus, we tested whether silencing either gene affects the protein expression level of atf <dig> and creb <dig>  as shown in figure 5a, creb <dig> silencing significantly reduced the protein expression of atf <dig>  while atf <dig> silencing did not significantly affect the protein expression level of creb <dig>  from these results, we hypothesized that both atf <dig> and creb <dig> regulate the gene expression of atf <dig>  this potential crosstalk  between atf <dig> and creb <dig> pathway was integrated into our system model , and the simulation results  predict a prolonged activation of atf <dig> level, with either atf <dig> binding to its own promoter, or creb <dig> binding to the atf <dig> promoter to induce atf <dig> gene expression.

atf <dig> protein binds to the cre site on the atf <dig> promoter in vitro
since chip-chip data for pcreb <dig> are available, we determined whether the creb <dig> protein interacts with the atf <dig> promoter. the hepatocyte-specific chip-chip data for pcreb <dig> binding on creb <dig> and atf <dig> promoters were obtained from the creb <dig> target gene database  <cit> . a cut-off value of binding ratio ≥  <dig> and confidence level p-value ≤  <dig>  was used to determine pcreb positive promoters . chip-chip data showed that both atf <dig>  and creb <dig>  are positive for pcreb <dig> in hepatocytes, suggesting that the creb <dig> protein directly binds on both the creb <dig> and atf <dig> promoters. in addition, to experimentally examine whether the atf <dig> protein interacts with the atf <dig> promoter, we designed an atf <dig> probe  which contains one cre site  and performed an emsa assay. as shown in figure  <dig>  the atf <dig> probe formed a dna-protein complex with the nuclear extract from the palmitate-treated hepg <dig> cells . the igg antibody does not cause any significant change of the dna-protein complex , while the atf <dig> antibody eliminated the complex . since the disappearance of a band by the addition of a specific antibody, but without a supershift, provides evidence of dna-protein complex  <cit> , our results suggest that the atf <dig> protein directly binds to the cre site on the atf <dig> promoter. thus, the chip-chip data and our emsa data confirmed our potential models in figure 5c and 5d, supporting that both atf <dig> and creb <dig> proteins could regulate the atf <dig> gene expression.

in-silico perturbation study suggests the essential signaling pathways for atf <dig> and creb <dig> activation mediated by palmitate
to identify the essential signaling pathways of atf <dig> and creb <dig> activated by palmitate, we simulated a model that incorporated our experimental findings and then evaluated the dynamics of eif2α phosphorylation, atf <dig> expression, and creb <dig> phosphorylation, by systematically deleting specific pathways. we addressed whether pka, p <dig>  ca2+ activation regulated by palmitate are essential for creb <dig> phosphorylation. the in silico knock-out results  showed that pka-creb <dig> and p38-creb <dig> interactions did not alter the dynamics of the model. however, the deletion of ca2+ signaling dramatically reduced creb <dig> phosphorylation . the model further showed that the pka-, p38-, ras-deficient model was able to capture the dynamic response of creb <dig> and atf <dig>  as long as the ca2+ signaling was able to induce creb <dig> phosphorylation in response to the palmitate treatment. it has been shown that ca2+ dependent-calmodulin  plays an important role in the activation of the creb <dig> pathway  <cit> , and our simulation results suggest that the calcium signaling pathway should be an essential component in the signaling network in response to palmitate stimulation of the liver cells. in other words, calcium signaling is sufficient to activate creb <dig> phosphorylation, without the other pathways, and to recapitulate the dynamic behavior observed experimentally.

since pkr and perk are two main upstream signaling components of atf <dig>  we further evaluated whether knock-out of either pkr or perk perturbs the signaling dynamics of atf <dig>  simulation results  suggest that the differences between pkr and pekr perturbations  show up at an early time step . the atf <dig> level under pkr-silencing decreased much more significantly than the level under perk-silencing in the earlier time point . this subtle difference comes from the underlying mechanism of the regulatory network where pkr and perk plays different roles , and is captured by the model. our experimental results confirm this difference , that pkr-knockdown cells showed significantly lower atf <dig> gene expression level at the earlier time point , while perk-knockdown started to reduce the atf <dig> gene expression level at a later time . these results are consistent with the in-silico simulations , suggesting that pkr is responsible for the early activation of atf <dig>  in addition, since er stress in human embryonic kidney cells has been shown to involve the activation of pkr by pact   <cit> , we experimentally tested whether pact silencing blocks atf <dig> mrna expression levels. treating the cells with palmitate for 3 hr resulted in a significant decrease in the atf <dig> gene expression , suggesting that the pact-pkr pathway is essential for the early atf <dig> gene expression, and possibly for an early er stress response. based on our computational analysis and experimental results, we identified the essential pathways involved in activating atf <dig> and creb <dig> in hepg <dig> liver cells upon palmitate treatment .

discussion
increased long-chain saturated fatty acids, a characteristic feature of obesity and nash  <cit> , can induce er stress, activate the upr, and lead to cell death in hepatocytes  <cit> . increasing number of studies implicate an involvement of palmitate in er stress-induced apoptosis in liver cells  <cit> , but the mechanism by which palmitate regulates the upr signaling pathways is unclear. the present study sought to determine which signaling pathways are essential for the activation of atf <dig>  which plays a crucial role as a mediator of er stress-induced apoptosis.

pkr, an eif2α kinase, has recently emerged to be involved in er stress-induced apoptosis by pharmacological er inducers, thapsigargine and tunicamycin  <cit> . lee et al. found that activated pkr phosphorylated the eif2α in a perk-independent manner when hek293a cells were treated with thapsigargine  <cit> . they showed that pkr was responsible for approximately 40% and perk for over 50% of the total phosphorylated eif2a at 12 h upon thapsigargin treatment. however, our study suggests that the contributions of pkr and perk on eif2α phosphorylation change in a time dependent-manner upon palmitate treatment. at an earlier time , pkr is entirely responsible for eif2α phosphorylation , with perk adding to this contribution, to the eif2α phosphorylation, at 6 hr . the relative contributions of pkr and perk on eif2α phosphorylation would also depend on the types of inducers and cells  <cit> . it would be worthy in future to investigate the kinetics of pkr and perk activations to obtain more information on the roles of pkr and perk-dependent er stress.

along with the positive regulation of pkr and perk on eif2α phosphorylation, a negative feedback loop could relieve the translational inhibition during er stress, through gadd34-mediated pp <dig> activation  <cit> . atf <dig> has been shown to bind specifically to a conserved atf site on the gadd <dig> promoter in a stress-dependent manner. gadd <dig> in turn binds and activates the pp <dig> protein, which leads to eif2α dephosphorylation and the resumption of general translation. in contrast to the conventional mechanism, we found that palmitate did not promote pp <dig> phosphorylation and the negative feedback mechanism was not activated in the palmitate-induced er stress in hepg <dig> cells. blockage of the negative feedback by palmitate may promote atf <dig> accumulation in the cells while maintaining a normal level of eif2α phosphorylation. in keeping with the concept of our study, a recent report suggested that salubrinal  interrupts the feedback mechanism by inhibiting gadd34/pp <dig> complex activity, thereby potentiating palmitate-induced er stress in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> . similar to the synergistic roles of salubrinal and palmitate in β-cells, palmitate alone may be sufficient to induce er stress-induced apoptosis in hepg <dig> cells  <cit> .

atf <dig> is known to form homo and heterodimers for dna binding  <cit> . one study showed that er stress induces a complex formation between endogenous atf1/creb <dig> and atf <dig>  subsequently binding to the atf/cre site of the grp <dig> promoter  <cit> . along with the chip-chip data  <cit> , one group recently suggested that creb <dig> is able to bind the cre site  on the atf <dig> promoter and a constitutively active pka catalytic subunit dramatically activated atf <dig> promoter through pka-creb <dig> signaling  <cit> . consistent with this study, our experimental and computational data showed that pka activated by palmitate at a later time  upregulates creb phosphorylation, subsequently inducing the atf <dig> expression. in addition, our emsa data suggested that atf <dig> protein binds its own atf <dig> promoter region containing the cre site  and the positive-feedback stabilizes the atf <dig> expression. upon palmitate treatment, pka or ca2+-dependent cam signaling pathways could enhance the interaction of creb <dig> alone or the atf4/creb <dig> heterodimer with the atf <dig> promoter to prolong atf <dig> accumulation. although these remain open questions, our findings suggested that both atf <dig> and creb <dig> binding on the atf <dig> promoter plays an important role in prolonging atf <dig> accumulation upon palmitate exposure.

in this study, our in silico model provides a framework to integrate regulatory information into a complex network and test the network for consistency by comparing the dynamic simulations with experimental measurements. our simulations show inconsistencies between current knowledge of the network and our observation of palmitate-induced er stress in the liver cells, which led us to explore the temporal response of the different pathways  to palmitate stimulation. this led to the identification of an essential feedback structure in the downstream atf4/creb <dig> regulation that differs from the conventional understanding of the mechanism. the study demonstrates an iterative learning process in which we begin by integrating the current knowledge to build a model to generate hypothesis, which is tested with experiments to obtain novel information. the new information is then incorporated into the network model to correct and update our understanding of the regulation. the updated model can be used to guide new experiments, thereby forming an iterative process that can systematically be applied to study biological processes. the discrete dynamic modeling approach developed in  <cit>  for signaling network was expanded to account for transcriptional regulation by introducing delays into the regulation. new data and new information could be easily incorporated by adding delays , altering gene activity states  or the network wiring , as demonstrated in this study of the regulatory network underlying palmitate-induced er stress. this systems biology approach can be applied to other biological process to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory network by integrating experimental measurements and computational simulation.

CONCLUSIONS
integrating experiments and computational simulations helped to identify several notable findings, summarized in figure  <dig>  first, the dynamics of the signaling profiles show that palmitate initiates the pkr-eif2α-atf <dig> pathway through pact-pkr activation at an earlier time and perk later helps to maintain eif2α phosphorylation. second, atf <dig> and creb <dig> bind the atf <dig> promoter to contribute to a prolonged atf <dig> accumulation and their feedbacks appear necessary for er-stress induced apoptosis. third, palmitate responds later to pka activation and possibly along with the ca2+ dependent-cam signaling pathway to increase creb <dig> phosphorylation. thus this systems biology approach helped provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which palmitate induces er stress in liver cells.
