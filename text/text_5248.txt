BACKGROUND
the mouse tongue contains three types of taste papillae: fungiform, circumvallate, and foliate. each papilla houses one  or many taste buds . in mice, each taste bud contains approximately 60- <dig> taste cells that are divided into  <dig> types: i, ii, and iii elongated or fusiform cells, and round, basal type iv cells. type i cells are thought to have a glial function within the bud, and express blood group h antigen, a membrane-associated carbohydrate moiety, and glast, a glutamate-aspartate transporter often present in glial cells, as well as ntpdase <dig>  a member of the family of calcium-dependent ecto-atpases  <cit> . recent studies suggest that type i cells may also function in salt taste transduction  <cit> . type ii cells are receptor cells, which transduce sweet, bitter and umami stimuli  <cit> , and overlapping subsets of type ii cells are immunoreactive for α-gustducin, phospholipase cβ <dig>  <cit> , and the inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate receptor  <dig>   <cit> . α-gustducin-knockout mice are insensitive to bitter tastants  <cit> , linking this particular marker to the bitter sensitive subpopulation of type ii cells  <cit> . type iii cells transduce sour stimuli  <cit>  and salty  <cit> , and form synapses with nerve fibers  <cit> . this latter cell type expresses ncam  <cit>  and is serotonin immunopositive  <cit> , as well as immunoreactive for snap- <dig>  <cit> .

in the adult tongue, cells within taste buds undergo continual turnover; peripheral epithelial cells around taste buds are proliferative, while elongated cells and type iv cells within taste buds are post-mitotic  <cit> . both the intragemmal  basal and perigemmal  epithelial cell populations have each been suggested to be responsible for generating cell types i-iii  <cit> . birthdating studies, however, imply that perigemmal cells are the exclusive progenitors for taste buds cells, as proliferating cells are observed only around taste buds, and then appear to become post-mitotic, enter the taste bud as immature taste cells, and differentiate, as they move from the border region into the central region of taste buds  <cit> . for example, immature type ii taste cells are born at least 2- <dig> days before they express specific type ii cell markers  <cit> .

little is known about molecular regulation of taste cell turnover, although a number of well known signaling pathways are expressed in cells within and surrounding taste buds. for example, sonic hedgehog  is expressed in basal cells  within taste buds, while the shh receptor, patched <dig> , is expressed in perigemmal epithelial cells adjacent to shh-expressing cells  <cit> . mash <dig>  a transcription factor in the notch pathway, is expressed in a subset of differentiated type iii cells, and is also expressed in a subset of shh expressing basal cells, suggesting a possible function for mash <dig> in the transition from basal cells to type iii cells  <cit> . prox <dig>  another transcription factor, has strong expression in basal cells and weak expression in elongated cells, again suggesting a role in taste cell differentiation  <cit> . sox <dig>  an hmg box transcription factor implicated in stem cell regulation in numerous other systems  <cit> , is expressed in large numbers of circumvallate taste cells residing in the basal and middle compartment of each bud, as well as in perigemmal cells, again suggestive of a role in differentiation of immature taste cells into mature taste cells  <cit> .

bone morphogenetic proteins  are multifunctional signaling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor ß  superfamily. bmps regulate many cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration   <cit> . in the developing taste organs of embryos, bmp <dig> is precisely co-expressed with shh in taste placodes  <cit> . a recent study using cultured embryonic tongue explants revealed that bmp influences formation of fungiform taste papillae  <cit> . in adult mice, however, the role of bmp in taste cell renewal has not been explored.

following up on a report that bmp <dig> is expressed in mature taste buds  <cit> , we have examined the pattern of bmp4-ß-gal expression in both circumvallate and fungiform taste buds with respect to taste cell type, and proliferative state. interestingly, we find both differences and similarities in the expression pattern of bmp4-ß-gal in fungiform versus circumvallate taste buds. in fungiform papillae, bmp4-ß-gal-expressing cells are located exclusively in a small number of basal epithelial cells outside of taste buds and are never encountered inside taste buds; whereas in the circumvallate papilla, bmp4-ß-gal is expressed by perigemmal cells, as well as by immature taste cells and a subset of each of the  <dig> elongate taste cell types. these data suggest both conserved and divergent roles for bmp <dig> in these  <dig> papillae. specifically we find that in both fungiform and circumvallate papillae bmp4-ß-gal marks a slowly dividing, perigemmal taste bud stem cell population and/or local signaling center, which perhaps regulates taste cell renewal, while, unique to the circumvallate papilla, bmp4-ß-gal is expressed additionally in differentiating taste cells.

RESULTS
bmp4-ß-gal is expressed in epithelial and taste cells of the circumvallate papilla, but only in perigemmal epithelial cells around taste buds in fungiform papillae
to determine the expression pattern of bmp4-driven ß-galactosidase  in taste buds, we examined the distribution of ß-gal immunopositive or x-gal reactive cells in the tongues of bmp4lacz hemizygous mice  <cit> . this mouse line has been engineered so that a nuclear lacz coding sequence replaces that of bmp <dig> at the native locus. thus ß-galactosidase protein expression is a reliable reporter of native bmp <dig> expression  <cit> , although ß-gal expression likely persists longer than bmp <dig> protein  <cit>  .

in circumvallate papillae, bmp4-ß-gal is present in perigemmal cells adjacent to taste buds proper , as well as in intragemmal fusiform cells . although we did not quantify this, we also noticed that there appeared to be different levels of transgene expression within circumvallate taste cells, with some cells expressing high levels , while other cells had much lower x-gal activity . from our first perusal of the circumvallate papilla expression pattern, it appeared that more intragemmal cells were bmp4-ß-gal positive in the deeper part of each circumvallate trench . this bore true after quantitative analysis; the number of bmp4-ß-gal intragemmal cells per taste bud was significantly greater in the bottom part of papilla . however, we detected no significant difference in the number of bmp4-ß-gal expressing cells per bud with respect to medial versus lateral epithelium location with the circumvallate papilla.

by contrast, in the anterior tongue, bmp4-ß-gal was detected in filiform papillae  and in fungiform papillae, where perigemmal epithelial cells adjacent to taste buds displayed ß-galactosidase activity . however, ß-gal positive cells were never present within cells detected inside of taste . these expression patterns were identical using either x-gal histochemical staining or anti-ß-galactosidase immunostaining. this dichotomy in bmp4-ß-gal expression with respect to papillae type suggested that: 1) bmp4-ß-gal marks a subset of perigemmal taste bud progenitor cells in both fungiform and circumvallate papillae; and 2) in the circumvallate, bmp4-ß-gal is also labeled by a subset of taste cells, perhaps those in the process of differentiating.

we also detected bmp4-ß-gal in the mesenchyme of the lamina propria beneath taste buds in both circumvallate and fungiform papillae . to further define the epithelial versus mesenchymal identity of the bmp <dig> cells in both circumvallate and fungiform papillae, we performed double labeling for bmp4-ß-gal and cytokeratin 14-ir , which marks basal keratinocytes of oral epithelia  <cit> . we observed several patterns of labeling in both taste papilla types:  in the same section, we found bmp4-ß-gal extragemmal cells  outside taste buds and perigemmal cells  were double-labeled with k <dig> ;  k <dig> immunonegative bmp4-expressing perigemmal cells located near k14-immunopositive cells in the epithelium ; and  lamina propria  and epithelial  bmp4-ß-gal and k14-immunonegative cells immediately adjacent to one another .

bmp4-ß-gal is expressed in a small percentage of all three differentiated taste cell types in circumvallate papillae
to further characterize the expression of bmp4-ß-gal in circumvallate taste bud cells, we performed double immunofluorescence for ß-gal and mature taste cell markers. double staining with antisera against known taste cell markers revealed a small number of all  <dig> fusiform taste cell types  were also immunoreactive for bmp4-driven ß-gal . using anti-ntpdase <dig> to detect type i cells  <cit> , we observed that  <dig> % of ntpdase2- immunoreactive  cells were also ß-gal-ir . to detect the extent of bmp4-ß-gal expression in type ii cells, we employed anti-gustducin or anti-plcß <dig> antisera . very few double-labeled gustducin-ir cells were encountered, while  <dig> % of plcß2-ir cells expressed ß-gal . ncam and serotonin antisera were used to assess bmp4-ß-gal expression in type iii cells , and 8% of serotonin-ir cells and  <dig> % of ncam-ir cells were ß-gal-immunopositive . finally, pgp <dig>  antiserum recognizes a subset of both type ii and iii cells, which are not immunoreactive for gustducin or serotonin, respectively  <cit> . double immunolabeling for ß-gal and pgp <dig>  revealed that  <dig> % of pgp <dig> -ir expressing cells also were ß-gal-ir .

in contrast to bmp4-ß-gal expression within circumvallate taste buds and as expected from our initial analysis of xgal staining, fungiform taste buds were virtually devoid of bmp4-ß-gal, and thus were not co-labeled with markers of differentiated taste cells . in the anterior tongue, intragemmal bmp4-ß-gal was never detected in fungiform papillae. interestingly, however, there were rare cases of ß-gal expression in the middle and posterior fungiform taste buds . the type of taste cells expressing bmp4-ß-gal was not explored further, as their incidence was infrequent.

co-expression of bmp4-ß-gal and sox2
because bmp4-ß-gal was expressed in only a small percentage of mature taste cells within the circumvallate papilla, we tested if bmp4-ß-gal co-localized with sox <dig>  a putative marker of immature taste cells  <cit> . sox <dig> is involved in embryonic taste bud formation  <cit> , and has been suggested to play a role in the differentiation of all  <dig> taste cell types in circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . consistent with the hypothesis that bmp <dig> is expressed in immature taste cells, we found most, but not all, sox2-ir taste cells were also bmp4- ß-gal-ir , although many sox2-ir were not double labeled . similarly, while most bmp4-ß-gal-ir cells were immunoreactive for sox <dig>  singly labeled bmp <dig> cells were readily detected .

birthdating of bmp4-ß-gal -expressing taste cells within circumvallate taste buds
we hypothesized from our analysis of expression of sox2-ir and of immunomarkers of differentiated taste cells, that the bmp4-ß-gal immunopositive intragemmal cells in circumvallate taste buds may represent an early phase of taste cell differentiation. to test the idea that immature taste cells express bmp4-ß-gal as they undergo differentiation, mice were injected with brdu, and then sacrificed at  <dig> hour intervals, up to  <dig> hours post-injection, encompassing the time frame when type ii and type iii taste cells are known to begin differentiation  <cit> . at  <dig> hours post-injection, some bmp4-ß-gal cells inside taste buds were brdu-ir , consistent with the idea bmp4-ß-gal is expressed by newly generated taste cells. at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-injection, double-labeled cells were also observed in the basal region of taste buds . specifically at these  <dig> later time points, the number of co-labeled cells was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  at  <dig> hours post-injection, and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  at  <dig> hours post-brdu injection . the number of double labeled taste bud cells showed a statistically significant increase at  <dig> hours post-injection compared with  <dig> hours post-injection , but not with  <dig> hours post-injection. these data suggest that bmp <dig> is expressed in immature taste cells as they enter the taste bud, and this expression may mark a transition stage as immature cells differentiate into mature taste cells.

the relationship between proliferating epithelial cells and bmp4-ß-gal perigemmal cells
in circumvallate and fungiform papillae, bmp4-ß-gal expressing perigemmal epithelial cells are also found adjacent to taste buds, suggesting that these cells may be involved in the continual renewal of adult taste cells. to address this issue, we assessed the distribution of actively cycling cells in circumvallate and fungiform taste papillae, with the expectation that a few stem cells and all transit amplifying cells would be mitotically active. we employed  <dig> immunomarkers to identify dividing cells: 1) proliferating cell nuclear antigen  present in all phases of cell cycle except early g <dig>  <cit> ; 2) ki- <dig>  which detects all phases in actively cycling cells, i.e., g <dig>  s, g <dig>  and m  <cit> ; 3) brdu, which is incorporated into dna during s phase  <cit> ; and 4) phospho-histone  <dig>  which marks cells in m phase   <cit> . the vast majority of basal epithelial cells of both the fungiform and circumvallate taste papillae were actively cycling, as evidenced by broad ki- <dig>  and pcna-ir , while a small percentage of cells were mitosing and were ph3-ir . in both circumvallate and fungiform papillae, a significant number of perigemmal cells were ki-67-immunopositive or pcna-ir . however, cells expressing proteins indicative of actively cycling cells were never encountered within taste buds, only in adjacent taste epithelial cells, consistent with the model that epithelial cells around taste buds are proliferative and give rise to immature, postmitotic taste cells, which then enter the taste buds  <cit> .

because bmp4-ß-gal perigemmal cells appeared to reside in the proliferative regions of each of the taste papillae, we investigated whether bmp4-ß-gal perigemmal cells adjacent to taste buds were actively cycling. using double-staining for x-gal histochemistry with ki- <dig> immunocytochemistry, we found that bmp4-ß-gal perigemmal cells were never ki-67-immunopositive , indicating that bmp <dig> expressing cells are not mitotically active.

characterization of the timing of cell renewal in fungiform vs. circumvallate taste buds
because bmp4-ß-gal intragemmal cells are absent in fungiform taste buds, yet are present in circumvallate buds, we wondered if this difference reflected differences in the timing of taste cell renewal between the papillae; are circumvallate taste cells generated more rapidly from the proliferative pool, and thus persistent bmp4-ß-gal expression inside taste buds is an artifact of ß-galactosidase perdurance? to assess if the rate of cell movement into taste buds differs between circumvallate and fungiform taste buds, mice were injected with brdu, and then harvested at distinct times after injection. initially,  <dig> hours after brdu injection, after cells in s phase had incorporated the labeled nucleotide, all labeled cells are found outside of both circumvallate and fungiform taste buds, in the basal papilla epithelium adjacent to buds, as well as elsewhere in taste papillae . brdu-labeled cells were never detected within taste buds at this early time point. however, at  <dig> hrs post-brdu injection, some brdu-ir cells were observed inside circumvallate taste buds, but not inside fungiform taste buds . by  <dig> hours post-injection, however, brdu-ir cells were detected in both circumvallate and fungiform taste buds , indicating that immature taste cells enter taste buds between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after their last division. by  <dig> hours, numerous brdu-ir cells were evident within taste buds in both papillae , consistent with the reports of others that have detected brdu-ir cells inside taste buds at 12- <dig> hours post-injection  <cit> . numerous brdu-ir intragemmal taste cells were present  <dig> and  <dig> hours post injection . importantly, despite the differences in bmp4-ß-gal expression in fungiform versus circumvallate taste buds , we did not detect any significant difference in cell cycle kinetics for taste cell genesis between these  <dig> different taste fields . thus, the rate at which new cells are contributed does not differ between circumvallate and fungiform taste buds.

the number of brdu-ir cells inside taste buds per taste bud profile at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours post-injection . there is no statistical difference between the number of new cells at any time point between the circumvallate and fungiform taste buds .

discussion
bmp <dig> regulates embryonic development of taste papillae  <cit> , but its expression and role in adult taste buds has not been investigated. we show here that bmp <dig>  via a genetically engineered lacz reporter mouse line, is expressed in a subset of cells associated with mature taste buds, but that the pattern of expression differs between the circumvallate and fungiform taste papillae. in the circumvallate, bmp4-ß-gal is expressed within taste buds, by a subset of cells of each taste cell type, as well as by likely immature taste cells. perigemmal epithelial cells within the circumvallate trenches are also bmp4-ß-gal positive. by contrast, bmp4-ß-gal intragemmal cells are absent from fungiform taste buds; instead, only a small number of perigemmal epithelial cells are bmp4-ß-gal positive. these differing expression patterns suggest that bmp <dig> expression marks the same perigemmal cell population in both fungiform and circumvallate taste epithelia, but hints at an additional role for this gene product in within taste buds of the circumvallate papilla.

throughout our study we have equated bmp4-ß-gal expression with that of bmp <dig> protein. this reporter allele comprises a lacz knockin to the bmp <dig> coding region and regulation of transcription of this locus should thus be unaltered. further, ß-galactosidase expression in this mouse line has been shown repeatedly and in a variety of tissues and developmental stages to accurately reflect bmp <dig> mrna expression  <cit> , including faithfully replicating bmp <dig> mrna expression in the developing taste bud progenitor cells of mouse embryos  <cit> . nonetheless, we were unable to confirm this concordance in adult mouse taste epithelium. we used  <dig> different bmp <dig> antisense probes and were never able to detect signal above background in the lingual epithelium, even though one of these probes worked well in our positive control tissue, i.e., hair follicles . one explanation is that bmp <dig> mrna is expressed at very low levels in adult taste tissue, and is undetectable via in situ hybridization. given the persistence of ß-gal protein, we suspect that the bmp4lacz line reports subtle, perhaps more short-lived, bmp <dig> protein expression patterns that would otherwise be missed. alternatively, albeit less likely, bmp <dig> mrna may be specifically degraded in taste epithelium resulting in the absence of protein, while lacz transcripts escape this suppression due to differences in mrna structure. however, given the documented conformity of bmp <dig> mrna expression patterns with those of ß-galactosidase expression in this knockin line, we are reasonably confident that the reporter reveals bmp <dig> expression in adult taste epithelium.

one explanation for the differences in expression patterns and potential roles of bmp <dig> between circumvallate and fungiform papillae may be due to differences in their embryonic origins  <cit> . although in all vertebrate, taste buds arise from local epithelium  <cit> , fungiform and circumvallate taste buds may derive from epithelia of different origins. in rats, keratin 20-ir is distributed in the posterior third of the tongue, suggesting that this region, including circumvallate papillae, derives from endoderm  <cit> , while the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, in which fungiform papillae reside, is derived from ectoderm   <cit> . we have observed rare bmp4-ß-gal expressing cells inside fungiform taste buds, but only in the most posterior fungiform papillae , which may possess this expression pattern due to an endodermal origin. these ideas remain to be tested until we obtain a clear understanding of the contributions of endoderm and ectoderm to the epithelium lining the oral cavity.

in fungiform and circumvallate taste buds, bmp4-ß-gal is expressed by a relatively small number of perigemmal epithelial cells located adjacent to taste buds, in the same general location as the progenitor population for taste cells. stone  <cit> , using x-inactivation mosaic mice, reported that multiple progenitors give rise to individual taste buds, and these progenitors are assumed to comprise the basal cells located at the base of taste buds, and/or perigemmal cells situated adjacent to taste buds proper  <cit> . most recently, okubo  <cit>  have shown that cells within taste buds arise from k14-expressing basal keratinocytes, which sit along the basement membrane of the lingual epithelium, including that of taste papillae. taste cells within buds do not express k <dig>  but rather express cytokeratin  <dig>  <cit> . in our studies, while bmp4-ß-gal perigemmal cells are located in a position consistent with that of proposed progenitors and many of bmp <dig> cells were also k <dig> positive, we could find no evidence that these cells are actively dividing, via both brdu birthdating and immunostaining for known markers of proliferation. however, it is possible that these bmp4-ß-gal cells divide so infrequently that we simply did not examine enough taste buds from enough mice at a larger range of times, although we did assay  <dig> mice ranging in age from  <dig> months to  <dig> months, and in no case encountered a single bmp4-ß-gal expressing cell that was in any state of proliferation. intriguingly, another set of bmp4-ß-gal cells in the taste epithelium does not express k14; thus, while these singly labeled cells do reside within the perigemmal taste epithelium, they are not within the progenitor pool identified by okubo and colleagues  <cit> . in conclusion, our expression data indicate that the perigemmal bmp4-ß-gal cells in both the circumvallate and fungiform papillae are a heterogeneous epithelial population potentially comprising:  a slowly cycling taste bud stem cell population ; and  a niche population or a signaling center for taste bud stem cells in combination perhaps with nearby bmp4-ß-gal cells of the lamina propria, which together may regulate taste cell genesis from taste bud stem cells.

in circumvallate taste buds, bmp <dig> is expressed in early differentiating taste cells
our birthdating analysis with brdu is consistent with the model that taste cells are born outside of taste buds proper, and then, within a day, move into the taste bud at the margins, and ultimately come to occupy the taste bud core  <cit> . brdu is incorporated into dividing cells outside taste buds within 1- <dig> hours after injection, but brdu-ir cells are not evident in taste buds until 12- <dig> hours, mainly in the basal compartment. at later time points, as has been described by others, we find labeled taste cells become more centrally located, progressing toward the taste bud core within 24- <dig> hours post brdu injection  <cit> . this timeframe is consistent with reports where taste cells typically express markers of differentiation by  <dig> - <dig>  days after birth. for example, expression of brdu in gustducin-ir cells is first detected  <dig>  days after injection  <cit> .

to test the idea that bmp <dig> marks immature taste cells in the circumvallate papilla, we labeled newly dividing cells with brdu and followed these cells for  <dig> days to assess when bmp4-ß-gal expressing fusiform cells are born. as type ii cells differentiate at  <dig> - <dig> days after birth, we predicted that, if bmp <dig> marks a transitional stage from transit amplifying cells to mature taste cells, we would detect bmp4-ß-gal and brdu co-labeled cells within  <dig>  days of brdu injection. in fact, brdu is detected in bmp4-expressing fusiform cells beginning at  <dig> hours post-injection, suggesting that bmp4-expressing fusiform cells are indeed immature taste cells. it is possible, however, that ß-galactosidase in taste buds persists longer than native bmp <dig> protein would, which in vitro, is known to decay within  <dig> hours  <cit> , while ß-galactosidase has a much longer half-life   <cit> . thus, bmp4-ß-gal inside taste buds might not accurately reflect bmp <dig> expression, but rather would represent residual ß-galactosidase that was intially driven by the bmp <dig> promoter in cells outside of taste buds. if this were the case, the number of bmp4-ß-gal and brdu-ir double labeled cells inside taste buds should peak within  <dig> hours after brdu injection, as the half-life of ß-gal is  <dig> hours  <cit> . however, we find that the number of brdu and x-gal double positive cells inside taste buds peaks at  <dig> hours post-injection, well after the expected decay of ß-gal, indicating that bmp4-ß-gal inside taste buds must instead be due to active transcription and translation of lacz under the bmp <dig> promoter within newly generated taste cells in the circumvallate papilla.

there are at least  <dig> models for cell lineage relationships in taste buds:  taste cells derive from a single lineage, progressing from basal cells to type i, then to type iii, and finally to type ii cells during maturation  <cit> ;  taste buds are composed of at least two cell lineages, each of which produces a subset of differentiated taste cell types  <cit> ; or  all  <dig> taste cell types arise via distinct lineages  <cit> . to determine if bmp <dig> expression is limited to one cell type, and potentially marks one or a subset of taste cell lineages, we examined which cell types within circumvallate taste buds expressed bmp4-ß-gal. we found that a small percentage of each taste cell type  co-express bmp4-ß-gal, suggesting that intragemmal bmp <dig> is expressed by differentiating taste cells regardless of cell type. except for the subset of type ii cells immunopositive for gustducin, the percentages of double labeled bmp4-ß-gal and type i, ii, iii cells  are not statistically different , tending to support the hypothesis that bmp <dig> is broadly expressed by differentiating taste cells, regardless of cell type. however, this may not be the case for gustducin-ir cells, which are the subset of type ii cells within the circumvallate that transduce bitter taste  <cit> . as very few double-labeled gustducin-ir cells were detected, it may be that bmp <dig> is not involved in differentiation of the bitter-sensing cell lineage. the fact that the number of bmp4-ß-gal-expressing cells per taste bud is higher at the bottom portion of the circumvallate trenches suggests the possibility of more rapid turnover of cells in taste buds in the deeper regions of the papilla epithelium, but this idea remains to be tested.

to investigate further our hypothesis that bmp4-expressing cells within buds are immature taste cells, we assessed the expression of a proposed marker for immature taste cells, sox <dig>  <cit> , and compared this pattern to that of bmp4-ß-gal. high levels of sox <dig> expression have been found in the progenitor cells that are committed to taste cell lineage  <cit> . we, too, found that in circumvallate taste buds, a large number of bmp4-ß-gal intragemmal cells are co-immunoreactive for sox <dig>  providing another piece of evidence that bmp4-ß-gal marks immature taste cells.

what is the nature of the mitotically quiescent bmp4-ß-gal expressing epithelial cells in taste papillae?
it has been proposed that basal and/or perigemmal cells adjacent to taste buds comprise the taste progenitor population, responsible for continual generation of adult taste cells  <cit> . as in generalized epithelium, taste bud stem cells are thought to undergo asymmetric division to produce a progenitor daughter that goes through transit amplifying divisions to produce a number of immature taste cells  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized initially that the bmp4-ß-gal cells were stem cells and/or transit amplifying cells of the taste bud lineage. if so, these cells should express markers of actively cycling cells, including ki- <dig> and brdu incorporation during s phase dna synthesis. however, double labeling with ki- <dig>  which labels mitotically active cells in all phases of the cell cycle  <cit> , showed that these bmp4-ß-gal expressing cells were not actively cycling. we further confirmed this lack of mitotic activity with additional markers of cell proliferation , and in short duration birthdating studies employing brdu. in sum, these data indicate that bmp4-ß-gal expressing cells are not rapidly dividing transit amplifying cells.

that bmp4-expressing cells found outside of taste buds are not mitotically active suggests at least two possibilities:

1) bmp4-ß-gal-expressing epithelial cells are taste bud stem cells. in general, stem cells in adult tissues divide very infrequently, occupy protected microenvironments or niches, and are predominantly in the resting phase  of the cell cycle  <cit> . cells in g <dig> typically do not express gene products of cell proliferation, and our failure to detect mitotic bmp4-ß-gal cells is consistent with this criterion. in skin, quiescent stem cells are normally intermingled with the transit amplifying population   <cit> ; similarly, bmp4-ß-gal cells are located in the basal epithelium surrounding taste buds, where we find that the majority of cells are actively cycling. finally, okubo  <cit>  have recently suggested that multipotent stem cells located in the basal epithelium of fungiform papillae give rise to transit-amplifying daughters, which contribute to both taste buds and keratinocytes of the gustatory papillae. however, these latter studies involve genetic mapping of cells that express k <dig>  while the precise identity of the initially labeled cells was not assessed. in our study, while some bmp <dig> cells express k <dig>  another subset of perigemmal bmp4-ß-gal cells are not immunoreactive for k <dig>  yet are located in the taste papilla epithelium immediately adjacent to taste buds. this heterogeneity in basal keratinocyte marker expression may reflect different functions for these cell subpopulations. regardless of k14-immunoreactivity, however, we failed to detect proliferation of bmp4-positive cells.

2) a second possibility is that, instead of a taste bud stem cell population, bmp4-ß-gal-expressing epithelial cells represent a signaling center or compartment of the stem cell niche, which controls stem cell and/or transit amplifying cell division and/or differentiation. our double-staining experiments for bmp4-ß-gal and proliferation markers revealed that the bmp4-expressing cells in the subepithelial lamina propria are also mitotically inactive, suggesting that in concert, these epithelial and mesenchymal bmp <dig> cells adjacent to taste buds may maintain the niche, or signaling center for taste bud stem cells. interestingly, miura  <cit>  report that shh is expressed exclusively in basal cells within taste buds, whereas ptch <dig>  a shh receptor   <cit> , is expressed in the epithelial cells outside of taste buds, but adjacent to intragemmal shh expressing cells. moreover, mitotic cells, as detected via short term brdu incorporation are mainly in the ptch <dig> expressing region, raising the likelihood that ptch <dig> expressing cells comprise the transit amplifying population, and possibly the taste bud stem cells  <cit> . in both fungiform and circumvallate papillae, bmp4-ß-gal-expressing cells may lie adjacent to the ptch <dig> expressing cells, or may express ptc <dig> suggesting the possibility that bmp <dig> and shh may coordinate taste cell turnover, as has been demonstrated for regeneration of a number of other epithelial appendages, including hair follicles  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our expression and birthdating data suggest both shared and divergent functions for bmp <dig> in adult mouse taste buds of the fungiform and cirumvallate papillae. in both papilla types, bmp <dig> is found in epithelial cells adjacent to taste buds proper, and these cells, while resident in the proliferative zone, are themselves, mitotically quiescent. this suggests that bmp <dig> may be involved in taste cell renewal for taste buds of both anterior and posterior taste papillae. however, only in the circumvallate taste buds, we find bmp <dig> expressed by taste cells within taste buds, and expression occurs in a subset of all taste cell types, with the exception of bitter detecting type ii cells. combined with our birthdating analysis, we suggest that bmp <dig> expression occurs in early differentiating taste cells, and thus may function in taste cell maturation; this putative maturation function would, however, be restricted to circumvallate taste buds.
