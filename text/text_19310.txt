BACKGROUND
tapeworms belong to one of the three major groups of worms that parasitize humans, the other two comprises flukes  and round worms . despite their public health importance, genome-wide data are currently available only for a few parasitic platyhelminth species including schistosoma mansoni  <cit> , schistosoma japonicum  <cit> , schistosoma haematobium  <cit> , clonorchis sinensis  <cit> , and the tapeworms taenia solium, hymenolepis microstoma, echinococcus multilocularis, echinococcus granulosus   <cit>  and spirometra erinaceieuropaei  <cit> . recently, the  <dig> helminth genomes initiative headed by the wellcome trust sanger institute provided several additional draft genomes of nematodes, cestodes and trematodes .

cystic hydatid disease is a zoonosis caused by echinococcus granulosus sensu lato species complex which is associated with poverty and poor hygiene practices, particularly in livestock-raising communities  <cit> . it is a preventable condition that is recognized by the world health organisation as a “neglected” disease. it has been estimated that 1– <dig>  million disability-adjusted life years are lost worldwide due to human cystic echinococcosis  <cit>  and that up to $ <dig> billion are lost annually in the livestock industry  <cit> . e. granulosus s.l. has a complex life cycle, including intermediate hosts , where the hydatid cyst develops by asexual reproduction, and definitive hosts , where adult flatworms develop by sexual reproduction. humans are accidentally infected by the ingestion of tapeworm eggs in contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with definitive hosts. hydatid cysts develop mainly in the liver  and lungs , and less frequently in muscles, spleen, bones, kidneys, brain, eyes, heart and pancreas  <cit> . the rupture of an hydatid cyst and the sequelae of rupture are named secondary hydatid disease and are more important than the mass effect of hydatid cysts, mostly in the brain, where the mass effect has severe consequences.


echinococcus granulosus s.l. was initially described as being composed of ten genotypes   <cit> . in recent years, mitochondrial phylogenetic analyses allowed to classify most of the genotypes as new species  <cit> . the new classification determines that e. granulosus s. l. is composed of five species: echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto , echinococcus equinus , echinococcus ortleppi , echinococcus canadensis  and echinococcus felidis. all of them cause unilocular echinococcosis and are macroscopically indistinguishable at the larval stage . for many years they were considered to be the same species; nevertheless, some species show clear differences such as intermediate host infectivity, antigenic profile and infectivity to humans  <cit> . in human beings, e. granulosus s. s. and e. canadensis are the most prevalent species, representing ~ <dig> and ~22% of total worldwide cases reported for each species, respectively  <cit> . at present, there is no clear link between echinococcus genetic diversity and human infection features. some reports suggest that human infections caused by e. canadensis  presented smaller liver cysts than those caused by e. granulosus s. s.   <cit> , and that e. canadensis  is found more frequently in the brain  <cit> . in previous studies of e. canadensis isolates from south america we have demonstrated that g <dig> and g <dig> genotypes are genetically indistinguishable by most of the molecular markers employed . particularly, e. canadensis  was shown to differ from e. granulosus s. s.  in the rate of development in the definitive host  <cit> . recently, we demonstrated that e. canadensis  protoscoleces are unable to establish an infection in the murine model  <cit> . however, very little is known about the factors that determine its host specificity or developmental differences. in order to address biological differences among e. granulosus s. l. species, systematic experiments need to be performed involving all of the species. this approach is very difficult to carry out with echinococcus species since biological material from natural infections is difficult to sample and it is not possible to obtain the complete life cycle neither in vivo nor in vitro.

regard the disease control technics, albendazole is the only drug recommended by the world health organisation to treat cystic echinococcosis . however, this drug has low dissolution, low absorption and several side-effects  <cit> . in addition, resistance and/or differential efficacy can potentially arise in some echinococcus species; therefore new effective anti-echinococcosis drugs need to be urgently developed. hence, knowledge of the universe of potential gene product targets is essential.

despite its biological and public health importance, no genome-wide data have yet been produced for echinococcus canadensis . in this work we are describing the genome sequencing and annotation of e. canadensis  genome. we are showing comparative genomics and genome-wide snps analyses performed among three echinococcus species which revealed particular snps sites in known drug targets and metabolism genes. specific cestode gene families were identified based on large-scale orthology comparisons of gene families across the phyla. in addition, a curated list of potential new drug targets is presented. finally, phylogenetic analyses based on different approaches allowed to determine the genetic distance among echinococcus species. these data contribute to the growing global resources that allow new treatments and to understand the biology and particular features of these parasites.

RESULTS
the genome of echinococcus canadensis  and gene annotation
the e. canadensis  genome sequence was assembled from a combination of two illumina libraries. high-quality genomic dna was purified from a large unilocular cyst. polymerase chain reaction  amplification of cytochrome oxidase  <dig>  followed by direct sequencing confirmed the  genotype. five de novo assembly strategies were performed and the best assembly of e. canadensis  genome was chosen based on quality metrics such as n <dig>  deep coverage, number of contigs, %gc and the coverage of the e. multilocularis genome. the best assembly was achieved using spades  <cit>  . after removing putative non target contigs , the genome was composed of  <dig> contigs whose quality assembly parameters were: n <dig>  <dig>  kb, 55× depth coverage . the e. canadensis  genome assembly comprised 115 mb with  <dig> % of gc content. mapping and ordering of e. canadensis  contigs on the e. multilocularis chromosomes resulted in  <dig> – <dig> % of coverage and  <dig> – <dig> % of identity . the total number of contigs included a  <dig> -bp contig length belonging to the mitochondrial genome, with 85% of coverage, 95% of genes and  <dig> % of nucleotide identity in relation to the e. canadensis  mitochondrial genome, currently deposited in the genbank under the accession number ab <dig> . the core eukaryotic genes mapping approach  software  <cit>  was used to assess the completeness of the genome. the gene space was estimated to be > <dig> % complete and the most conservative cegma reference gene sets were recovered up to >95% rate in the e. canadensis  genome. protein-coding genes were predicted using the maker <dig> software  <cit>  along with species-specific gene models of e. multilocularis and e. granulosus  and transcriptomic data of e. canadensis . a total of  <dig>  gene model predictions were obtained comprising a gene density of  <dig>  genes per mb . a total of  <dig> proteins were functionally annotated as follows:  <dig> proteins were associated with interpro2go terms,  <dig> were associated by using a cestode-specific orthology group and  <dig> were annotated by reciprocal blast against uniprot database. the remaining  <dig> proteins were classified as hypothetical . the frequency of go  terms obtained for the annotated proteins is presented in additional file 2a. the two main categories found were binding  and catalytic activity , which is in accordance with the go terms frequency observed in other cestode genomes  <cit> . in addition, a total of  <dig> proteins of e. canadensis  were assigned to one or more ko  orthology) identifiers classified into  <dig> categories of the main  <dig> kegg pathways . we found that e. canadensis  had  <dig> ko terms associated with metabolism, grouped in  <dig> pathways. we found ~ 80% of kegg pathways expected in echinococcus. pathways such as de novo synthesis of nucleotide bases, amino acids and lipids seem to have been lost, which is in accordance with previous results obtained by zhang et al. and tsai et al.  <cit> , and reinforces the dependence of echinococcus on its host metabolites . regarding non-coding genes, a total of  <dig> microrna genes were identified in agreement with our previous results  <cit> . also  <dig> 18s,  <dig>  <dig> s and  <dig> 28s rrna genes were found in addition to  <dig> trna genes with  <dig> –100% of identity to previously described trnas sequences . a total of  <dig> trna gene clusters with up to  <dig> trna genes were identified, according to what has been reported for nematodes and mammalian genomes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> statistic measures of quality assembly. a cumulative length distribution using e. multilocularis assembly as reference genome. b

repetitive elements

e. canadensis  repeat sequences , including simple repeats, interspersed repeats and satellite dnas, were identified in the assembled genome using repeatmodeler  <cit>  and an in-house flatworm repetitive database. we found that the repeat content of the parasite genome was  <dig> % and included well-known repetitive elements, such as e. canadensis  genotype treg element described in previous studies by us  <cit> . to perform comparative genomic analyses, we selected a subset of sequences with more than 50% of coverage of the consensus repetitive sequences. this highly reliable set of repetitive elements was composed of  <dig> sequences and comprised  <dig> % of the e. canadensis  genome. repetitive sequences were classified as dna transposons , long terminal repeat  retrotransposons , long interspersed nuclear elements  , short interspersed nuclear elements   and unknown class  . moreover,  <dig> microsatellite sequences representing  <dig> loci in the e. canadensis  genome were identified as tandemly repeated multi-loci microsatellite emsb, which have been used to study the genetic diversity of the genus echinococcus  <cit> . the identity of the repetitive elements between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  ranged from  <dig> % to 100%, whereas between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis ranged from 57% to 100%. the most frequent e.cang7_rep sequence identified was the e.cang7_brep , which had high similarity with e. granulosus  egbrep repetitive dna element   <cit>  . this sine sequence had less conservation in e. multilocularis . also, e.cang7_brep sequences seem to be specific for flatworms since positive hits were found in hymenolepis microstoma, taenia solium, schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma japonicum, and no sequence similarity was observed in any other organisms. the e.cang7_brep sequence had  <dig> % of identity and  <dig> % of coverage in relation to terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature  sequences of e. granulosus   found by koziol  <cit> . the second most frequent repetitive element was e.cang7_rep <dig>  which had a high copy number in all of the flatworm species sequenced so far, being variable in all of the echinococcus species , and included an open reading frame  encoding for pol polyprotein. furthermore, e.cang7_rep <dig>  e.cang7_rep <dig> and e.cang7_rep <dig> contained sequences encoding for replicase domain, reverse transcriptase domain and rna recognition domain, respectively. recently, a novel trim has been found in e. multilocularis  <cit>  but lacked evidence of active retrotransposition in e. canadensis  and e. granulosus . in addition, most of the e.cang7_rep  detected in e. canadensis  had expression evidence  in the protoscolex and metacestode stages. e.cang7_brep and e.cang7_rep <dig> had a high number of rna-seq reads .

comparative genomics among echinococcus species
to determine the gene-order arrangement, we retrieved one-to-one orthologous gene pairs among e. multilocularis, e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  having previously ordered their contigs on e. multilocularis chromosomes and then using the orthomcl gene clustering . we found a high degree of conservation in the structure and organisation of genes within the three echinococcus species . the range of syntenic genes was from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis and from  <dig> to  <dig> %  between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  . in order to perform orthology analysis, we constructed orthologs groups from a total of  <dig> proteomes of different organisms, including model organisms and representatives of the phylum platyhelminthes. the total number of genes and orthology groups obtained in each organism are shown in additional file 1:  <dig>  and  <dig> . from a total of  <dig>  clusters of orthologous genes obtained,  <dig> were present in all of the flatworm parasites and in at least one species of metazoan, among which  <dig> orthologous groups were contained in all of the species of cestodes. the cestode category shared  <dig> groups with at least one non-cestode species of flatworm parasites,  <dig> were cestode-exclusive and  <dig> groups were found only in echinococcus species . a total of  <dig> e. canadensis  proteins belonging to echinococcus specific orthologous groups were further analysed , among which 80% were classified as hypothetical proteins. a total of  <dig> proteins had conserved domains and  <dig> proteins had molecular function go term associated with them . two of the five go categories grouped the 90% of all the echinococcus specific proteins. these categories were binding  and catalytic activity .fig.  <dig> circos plot of the genome of e. canadensis , e. granulosus and e. multilocularis. one-to-one orthologs connected according their distribution on their corresponding chromosomes

expanded protein families in echinococcus
a total of  <dig> expanded protein families consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> members were found in echinococcus . among them, we found the heat-shock protein  <dig>  family, which has been described by tsai et al.  <cit>  in all of the tapeworm genomes obtained so far  <cit> . we also found three interesting expanded families that were present only in the cestode orthology group: gps motif-containing protein, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and glycosyl transferase. the e. canadensis  gps motif-containing protein is related to polycystin- <dig>  a protein involved in central signal-transduction pathways and the gps motif  is the responsible of protein-protein interactions. polycystins form an expanded family of proteins composed of multiple members in fish, invertebrates, mammals and humans. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme is known to be involved in the ubiquitination pathway, modulating proteins degradation and protein-protein interactions. the ubiquitin-conjugating  complex consisted of up to  <dig> genes in echinococcus. protein sequence alignments showed a high conservation of the ubc superfamily domain  only among cestode parasites. the third expanded proteins family is the glycosyl transferases family, which is involved in glycan biosynthesis and modifications. this important pathway could play an important role in the biogenesis of the acellular carbohydrate-rich laminated layer, which is a unique echinococcus-specific trait and one of the morphological traits that differs among echinococcus species. these protein families are composed of  <dig> members that are conserved in cestodes but are very divergent in relation to other organisms .

drug targets
protein drug targets previously described by us  <cit>  were searched in the e. canadensis  counterpart gene repertory. comparative genomic analyses showed  <dig> –100% of identity with e. granulosus and e. multilocularis proteins, whereas the range of identity with s. mansoni proteins was lower, from  <dig>  to 97%. phylogenetic analyses including reference proteomes showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> drug targets had human orthologs . in order to obtain more specific drug target genes we selected new candidates considering the following criteria: to be present in all of the cestode species, to have high sequence conservation among cestodes  and to be absent or to have a high degree of divergence in humans . a total of  <dig> cestode proteins were selected and all these putative drug targets were grouped into  <dig> categories: 1- antigens: taeniidae antigen  and immunogenic protein ts11; 2-defence: antimicrobial peptide; 3- signalling: neuropeptides and peptide hormones; 4- transport: vacuolar  atpase g subunit containing protein; 5- metabolic processes: dolichol phosphate mannosyl transferase subunit containing protein and ef-hand calcium-binding protein; 6- transcription processes: zinc finger c2h2-containing protein and 7- conserved hypothetical proteins.  these proteins were subject of manual curation and are further described in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

cytosine methylation in echinococcus
cytosine methylation is a conserved epigenetic feature that is found throughout the phylum platyhelminthes. metazoan dna methyltransferases  are involved in catalysing this feature by transferring a methyl group  from s-adenosyl methionine  to the 5-carbon  position of cytosine in the genomic dna  <cit> . these “epigenetic marks” are subsequently recognized as binding cpg sites by methyl-cpg-binding domain proteins  and converted into signals that are necessary for generating phenotypic diversity  <cit> . dnmts and mbds complexes together with other proteins constitute the core of the metazoan dna methylation system in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. cytosine methylation has been observed in the s. mansoni genome and this epigenetic feature was directly dependent upon the presence of enzymatically active dnmt <dig>  <cit> . dna methylation has been described in several platyhelminthes species and homologous dnmt <dig> has been found in s. mansoni  <cit> . dnmt <dig> and cytosine methylation have been identified in the e. multilocularis protoscoleces. dnmt <dig> was also identified among the gene repertory of e. canadensis , but neither dnmt <dig> nor dnmt <dig> orthologs were found . mbds have been also observed in several species of platyhelminthes  <cit> , which seem to be members of the ancestral mbd2/ <dig> family  <cit> . despite sharing more than 70% of amino acid identity, which is indicative of a gene duplication event, mammalian mbd <dig> can bind methylated cytosine within genomic dna, whereas mbd <dig> cannot. therefore, further research is needed to identify whether these new platyhelminth mbd2/ <dig> proteins are functionally closer to methyl-cpg-binding mbd <dig> or to non-methyl-cpg-binding mbd <dig>  so far, only one mbd candidate has been found in each of the platyhelminth genomes. however, we not only found the previously described mdb protein in the e. canadensis  genome , but also identified a novel mbd that showed conserved domains and characteristic motifs of the mbd domain across members of the class cestode. the phylogenetic analysis grouped them into a specific cluster . these novel mbd proteins contain the n-terminal methyl-cpg-binding domain, which consist of  <dig> residues, a phd domain  of  <dig> amino acids in length and a bromodomain  toward the c-terminal comprising  <dig> residues.

cpg islands
cpg is the pair of adjacent nucleotides that appear in a row on the same strand of dna linked by a phosphodiester bond. cpg islands  are palindromic stretches of dna comprising about  <dig> base pairs long that contain a higher cpg density than the rest of the genome and are not methylated  <cit> . cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions can be considered gene markers and may also play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. approximately 70% of gene promoters reside within cgis  <cit> . enhancer elements can be located between cpgs or even include cpgs, thus hiding both the core promoter qualities and the enhancer qualities of the cgi  <cit> . since many transcription factors binding sites are gc-rich, cgis are likely to enhance binding to these sites, even in the absence of common promoter elements such as tata boxes  <cit> . the methylation of cgis results in stable silencing of gene expression  <cit> . it was also observed that, during gametogenesis and early embryonic development, cgis undergo differential methylation  <cit> . in this work, cgis distribution was evaluated in the three echinococcus species and particular differences were detected among distinct genomic regions. we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cgis, comprising a cgi density of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   in e. canadensis , e. multilocularis and e. granulosus , respectively. compared to studies carried out on mammalian genomes  <cit> , echinococcus genomes exhibited similar length of the stretches of dna where cgis reside but higher levels of both, cgi density and observed/expected ratio of cpg. when we performed cgis distribution analysis on coding regions and non-coding regions of echinococcus genomes we observed that the number of cgis and the cgis density were much higher in the coding regions. we also evaluated the distribution of cgis 5 kb upstream from coding regions and we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cgis in e. canadensis , e. multilocularis and e. granulosus , respectively. the cgi density was calculated considering only those regions where cgis were found. the values of cgi density observed were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively and slightly lower values than in coding regions but higher than in the rest of the genome were found . furthermore, we estimated the correlation between cgis density and other genomic features such as genome gc content, contig size and observed/expected ratio of cpg. in this regard, we observed a significant correlation between cgis density and genome gc content, and between cgis density and contig size in the three genomes of echinococcus . by contrast, there was no correlation between cgis density and the observed/expected ratio of cpg . we also estimated cgis density per contig length only in those contigs containing cgis for each echinococcus species . the median of cgis density in e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  genomes was lower in relation to e. multilocularis genome. the correlation between cgis density and genome gc content differed among the three analysed regions, i.e. whole genome, coding regions and upstream coding regions. the same pattern was observed for the three echinococcus species . in e. canadensis , the median of distance of cgis from the start codon of genes was roughly 2 kb, and the range for most of the genes was between  <dig> and 3500 bp approximately. the same results were found in e. granulosus  and e. multilocularis . we also identified cgis differentially distributed along the genome of the three echinococcus species, suggesting that the presence/absence of cgis upstream echinococcus genes could differentially regulate the gene expression. cgis upstream echinococcus genes are summarized in additional file 6:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the numbers of genes differentially preceded by cgis were  <dig> between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus ,  <dig> between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis and  <dig> between e. multilocularis and e. granulosus . interestingly, we found drug target genes differentially preceded by cgis. the genomic context for the ribonucleotide reductase small subunit and for the protein kinase that are differentially preceded by cgis is shown in fig.  <dig> for the three echinococcus species.fig.  <dig> correlations between cgi density and genomic features in the genomes of the three echinococcus species. a cgi density  versus contig gc content . b cgi density  versus log . c cgi density  versus contigs obs.cpg/exp.cpg. d cgi density  by echinococcus species

small rna pathway
since the discovery of mirnas in cestodes  <cit> , many reports have highlighted the importance of mirnas in several parasite species  <cit>  because of their relevant roles in mammals where they control several pathways, such as developmental timing, haematopoiesis, organogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. an important effector in mirna pathways is the protein argonaute . phylogenetic analyses showed two clades for the ago proteins: one clade grouped a highly conserved ago protein found in all of the organisms. the other clade grouped new ago/piwi-like proteins present only in flatworm parasites and are very different from any other ago/piwi-like protein described in humans, mice and flies  <cit> . in order to further characterise ago proteins in echinococcus  we identified the orthomcl clusters that included the ago proteins and searched for the characteristic paz and piwi domains. we found  <dig> ago proteins with an amino acid identity that ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> %. we confirmed the gene expression by rt-qpcr for the  <dig> agos in e. canadensis  metacestodes . in order to identify conserved domains and the possible interaction with a mirna, 3d structures of ago proteins were obtained by comparative modelling. for analysis purposes, we grouped the proteins into  <dig> groups , where the first one contained the conserved ago proteins, which have high identity with the mammal ago- <dig>  and the three other groups contained the echinococcus proteins of the new ago clade . each of the structures obtained showed rnaseh-like fold in concordance with the ago/piwi family proteins studied so far  <cit>  , except for proteins from group  <dig>  which lack the n-terminal region and a stretch of the paz domain.

ago proteins form a kind of channel or pocket in which the mirna resides and interacts with residues of piwi, mid and paz domains and the target mrna has access to mate with the mirna  <cit> . the argon domain located in n-terminal region contributes to the final conformation and has been described as being involved in the slicer activity. in spite of overall domain conservation, some particular residues are divergent between canonical and the platyhelminthic ago/piwi proteins, but they are conserved among proteins of this new clade . moreover, the presence of motifs l <dig> and l <dig> adjacent to the paz domain, which consists of two beta-sheets and two alpha-helices, respectively, confirmed that proteins from echinococcus ago group  <dig> belonged to the mammal conserved ago family . in contrast to mammals, where other agos lack the core related to slicer activity, we found the “dedh” core in all of the echinococcus ago protein groups located in the piwi domain which is decisive for the slicer activity of the protein on the target mrna  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of two defined motifs  at the n-terminal is also needed for the slicer activity . in humans, the methionine in motif i plays an important role in the slicer activity of the messenger. on the other hand, motif ii comprises two alpha-helices on the exposed surface of the protein, which is involved in the activation of the rna-induced silencing complex  and removal of the passenger strand  <cit> . in echinococcus, the secondary structure of motif i and ii is conserved, but the expected methionine of the motif i in the n-terminal region is not present in any ago protein. the ago proteins of the group  <dig> of e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  lack the domain argon but present the act_ <dig> domain instead. act domains bind to amino acids and regulate associated enzyme domains that could alter the interaction with risc. finally, we searched for residues involved in binding the seed region of the mirna. the amino acid residues  constitute a motif that bind to the mirna seed region in the echinococcus ago group  <dig> which is conserved in relation to human ago- <dig>  whereas the proteins motif of the new ago- piwi-like clade  have a different amino acids sequence. surprisingly, this motif is conserved among the proteins of this new clade. the seed amino acid sequence of proteins in these groups is kdgt, except for the e. multilocularis emuj_ <dig> protein that changes an aspartic acid  for a glutamic acid  .

whole genome echinococcus single nucleotide polymorphisms
next-generation sequence reads were mapped to a reference genome to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms/variations . for all the analyses; the reads were first mapped against their own reference genomes and then against the genome of the corresponding analysed species. homozygous and heterozygous variant sites were identified and were marked in both the reference and the alternative allele . first, we evaluated the intraspecific variation in each echinococcus genome. we observed the highest number of intraspecific variant sites in the e. granulosus  genome, exhibiting a total of  <dig>  snps which comprised a snp rate of  <dig>  snps each 1000 bp. the lowest number of intraspecific variant sites was observed in the e. multilocularis genome consisting of  <dig> snps which exhibited a rate of  <dig>  snps each 1000 bp. in regard to the e. canadensis  genome, the number of intraspecific snps sites was  <dig> resulting in a snp rate of  <dig>  snps each 1000 bp.

genome-wide snps analyses performed among the three echinococcus species revealed more snps between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  than between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis. a total of  <dig>  snps were identified between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  genomes, comprising  <dig> heterozygous and  <dig>  homozygous snps. when we compared e. canadensis  with e. multilocularis we found  <dig>  snps sites comprising  <dig> heterozygous and  <dig>  homozygous snps. in both cases the transition/transversion ratio was  <dig> . furthermore, the comparison of e. granulosus  with e. multilocularis revealed  <dig>  snps which included  <dig> heterozygous and  <dig>  homozygous snps and a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>  . the number of snps located in introns and intergenic regions was also higher between e. canadensis and e. granulosus. by contrast the number of snps in coding regions among the three echinococcus species was fairly similar . regarding the analysis of polymorphic sites in coding regions, we demonstrated that the percentage of synonymous substitution was higher than the percentage of non-synonymous substitution in all of the analysed species. moreover, the rate of missense snps between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  was slightly higher than between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis , which involved  <dig> more non-synonimous snps. to confirm these results, we performed the same analysis as above using the e. granulosus  genome obtained by zhang et al.  <cit> , which comprised a different parasite isolate, sequence technology and assembly methods than the employed by tsai et al.  <cit> . the results obtained were virtually the same for both e. granulosus  genomes. finally, we assessed the snps distribution that causes changes in amino acid residues in  <dig> e. canadensis  proteins and its respective one-to-one ortholog in e. granulosus  and in e. multilocularis. this analysis revealed a higher distribution of amino acid changes per each  <dig> residues of protein between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  than between e. granulosus  and e. multilocularis, and even higher than between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis. this result showed differences among the species that were statistically significant according to the anova test . we also analysed the distribution of missense snps in genes of echinococcus species associated to keggs pathways classified in  <dig> pathways. these results showed again a higher snp density by gene between e. canadensis  and e. granuosus  than between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis, and between e. granulosus  and e. multilocularis too. snps distribution among keggs pathways is shown in figure .

snps validation
in order to validate and verify polymorphisms detected by mapping ngs reads, we performed pcr amplification followed by direct sequencing of coding regions of some selected genes. this analysis was focused on validating missense snps; therefore the primers were designed based on exon sequences flanking at least one missense polymorphism. since there are many snps among the different echinococcus species, to select the best regions for primer design we detected exon regions with low variability. selected regions were amplified by pcr of dna extracted from  <dig> independent parasite isolates, three hydatid cyst of e. canadensis , three hydatid cysts of e. granulosus  and four metacestode isolates of e. multilocularis. our results allowed us to characterise  <dig> polymorphisms  as “high confidence” since all of the selected snps that were detected by ngs were also found by direct sequencing and in all of the analysed organisms .

phylogenetic studies of three echinococcus species
the study of the echinococcus phylogeny was addressed using  <dig> different approaches: mitochondrial genome, single copy genes and genome-wide snps analysis.

the mitochondrial genome assembly in addition to all the available echinococcus mitochondrial genomes were used for the phylogeny reconstruction whereby it was possible to classify and discriminate among the echinococcus species. the mitochondrial phylogeny obtained was according to nakao  <cit>  .

from the total of  <dig>  clusters of orthologous genes we identified  <dig> single-copy groups which were subsequently used to perform a phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic trees obtained recovered the monophyly of chordata, arthropoda, nematoda and platyhelminthes in agreement with previously published results  <cit>  .

furthermore, to better understand the phylogenetic relationship between the taxa and to evaluate the contribution of snps to the genetic diversity among echinococcus species, we selected only the homozygous snps and used them to perform a phylogenetic analysis. after removing heterozygous snps, the homozygous snps were concatenated and the resulting alignment was used to create a phylogenetic tree by implementing the maximum likelihood method. the tree topology demonstrated a higher genetic distance between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  than between e. canadensis  and e. multilocularis, comprising a total of  <dig>  homozygous polymorphic sites. moreover, e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  diverge from a common node close to e. multilocularis node . since we observed that the number and type of changes varied according to the group of proteins analysed, random combinations of concatenated snp sequences were also subjected to phylogenetic studies and all converged into the same topology. in addition, we registered how many polymorphic loci are shared among the echinococcus species. for that purpose, we used a different reference genome in each one of the three rounds of mapping and we mapped the reads of the other two genomes against the selected reference. using e. canadensis  as reference,  <dig>  snps were found at the same loci . by contrast, using e. multilocularis as reference, we found  <dig>  shared loci . finally, using e. granulosus  as reference,  <dig>  loci were found,  . indeed, most of the snps were unique to one of the species and the highest number of shared loci was observed when the e. multilocularis genome was used as reference. it doubled and tripled the number of loci in relation to e. canadensis  and e. granulosus , respectively.fig.  <dig> snps and phylogeny based on genome-wide snps analysis a homozygous snp sites between e. canadensis , e. multilocularis and e. granulosus  species. the numbers in the overlap region indicate the number of snps between the species. the numbers in triple overlapping indicate the number of triallelic loci. b phylogenetic tree based on genome-wide snps analysis by maximum likelihood method




discussion
the echinococcus canadensis  genome

e. canadensis  is one of the most distributed parasites worldwide responsible for many human echinococcosis cases. in recent years, several genomes of platyhelminthes have become available; however it is yet an underexplored area. in this work we sequenced, assembled and annotated the 115-mb genome of e. canadensis  whose genome size is in the same order of magnitude as other platyhelminthes including other members of the genus echinococcus. the e. canadensis  genome contains  <dig>  genes with a core set of  <dig> orthologs shared among five cestode species. our work demonstrated that the genome of e. canadensis  is highly syntenic in relation to the other echinococcus genomes, which makes comparative genomic analysis exceptionally interesting and crucial for addressing the study of flatworms.

comparative genomics based on snps analyses results were unexpected. the intra specific snp frequency of e. canadensis  is almost  <dig> fold lower than the intra specific snp frequency found in e. granulosus . a high snps rate had already been observed for e. granulosus  by zheng et al.  <cit> ; even though both genomes were sequenced from genomic material from a single cyst . this observation indicates a lower intra cystic genetic diversity among protoscoleces of e. canadensis  in comparison with protoscoleces of e. granulosus . the higher genetic diversity between e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  was indeed unexpected due to they belong to the complex e. granulosus sensu lato, and therefore were supposed to be phylogenetically closer to each other than to e. multilocularis. on the other hand; despite the relevant number of snps among the echinococcus species, a similar distribution of snps for all the kegg pathways is observed for every gene, suggesting that there is no bias to accumulation of snps in a specific pathways.

new drug targets
the analyses of protein domain sequences of new putative drug targets demonstrated that some e. canadensis  proteins have greater differences with e. granulosus  than with e. multilocularis. this information is relevant for developing a drug against these parasites and to be effective in geographic regions where different species coexist. as previously described by cucher et al.  <cit> , both species are the most frequent in human echinococcosis cases and are sympatric in many countries worldwide. at present, there are only two methods for the treatment of hydatid disease: surgery and the use of benzimidazole, but both have often unsatisfactory results  <cit> . hence, novel treatment compounds are urgently needed. in this study, we identified several new potential drug targets against echinococcosis, which provided an expanded drug target repertoire. these proteins are highly conserved in cestodes but are absent or highly divergent in humans. one relevant feature would be related with the function of antimicrobial peptides. there is certain evidence that some proteins secreted by helminth parasites play a key role in modulating host immunity  <cit> . furthermore, studies of fasciola hepatica have described a secreted peptide that exhibits similar biochemical and functional characteristics to the human cathelicidin ll- <dig> and modulates the innate cell response by mimicking the function of host antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . analysis of peptide structure in addition to orthology studies and its conservation in cestodes suggest that the e. canadensis  possesses peptides that may exert an antimicrobial activity, as the proposed for the leucine-rich-repeat--containing proteins and the lectin-like proteins identified by zheng et al.  <cit> , or may play an immunomodulatory role as the proposed for the cathelicidin-like peptide of f. hepatica. highly expressed secreted peptides at infectious stages of the life cycle could be involved in host-parasite cross-talk and could play an essential role in regulating host immune responses which would prolong the parasites survival in mammalian host species. another relevant feature is related to e. canadensis  neuropeptides that could be useful for performing biochemical studies of signal transduction, which have been hindered due to the inability to obtain large quantities of flatworm neuronal tissues. indeed, these genes may represent potential drug targets for developing new therapeutic interventions or novel biopharmaceutical components.

regulation of gene expression
a relevant genomic feature is related to the cgis distribution that was studied in echinococcus genomes for first time in this work. since cgis are considered gene markers, they are expected to have a high correlation with the gene density which indeed was found in the echinococcus genome structure. both the number of extant cgis and the cgi density were much higher than in non-coding regions, which is similar to what was observed in mammalian genomes. our studies also demonstrated that the cgi density is in correlation with the distance from the start codon of genes and the corresponding upstream region. the position cgis and its corresponding cgis density in upstream coding regions may help to identify promoter regions by experimental and in silico approaches; tasks that have not yet been addressed in platyhelminthes. the diversity of eukaryotic promoters is the main obstacle for their characterisation, which is very important to understand the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription and would provide valuable information for the genetic manipulation of these parasites. echinococcus genomes exhibited a higher cgis density than the mammalian genomes, which is in accordance with the low levels of dna methylation reported in some platyhelminthes genomes and similar to many non-mammalian model organisms, such as round worms and flies, which also lack or have low levels of methylated dna  <cit> . experimental and computational studies corroborated that cgis tend to vanish during genome evolution by a mechanism of de novo methylation of their cpg dinucleotides, which subsequently change to tpgs or cpas due to a very high methylation-dependent transition rate . the mammalian proteome contains many members of dnmts and mbds proteins, which is in accordance with the significantly lower cgis density rate in comparison with the genomes of echinococcus species. the high cgis density rate ~  <dig> cgis/mb in the echinococcus genomes is well explained by the absence of other members of the family of dnmts and mbds proteins. this phenomenon is in agreement with the low levels of methylation observed in other members of the platyhelminthes phylum, such as e. multilocularis, the monogenean protopolystoma xenopodi and the turbellarian polycelis nigra and macrostomum lignano species  <cit> . e. canadensis  also provides an interesting model for studying fine-tune gene regulation during parasite development, because protoscoleces can rapidly respond to environment signals, giving rise to hydatid cyst or adult worms. on the other hand, since the e. canadensis  genome has a small number of members of the dna methylation system, as well as a novel and genus-specific mbd protein family member, this organism will provide an important parasite model for studying the evolution of methylation in platyhelminthes.

another regulatory mechanism is related to the differential expression of small rnas during parasite development in e. canadensis   <cit> . we performed structural analyses of ago proteins to gain further insight into small rna pathways. computational analyses including phylogenetic and protein structure studies confirm a new protein ago clade in echinococcus and suggest a possible interaction with mirna. the conservation of some particular residues could play an important role in binding small rna, in the stabilization of the mrna target and in the slicer activity. on the other hand, specific amino acid changes in the motif that binds the seed mirna site were also identified and are conserved through the new ago clade. these particularities may result into a distinctive small rna specificity and therefore a differential genes regulation that could be evaluated in future experiments. furthermore, since echinococcus lacks classical piwi proteins  <cit>  and also seems to lack pirna molecules  <cit>  it would be interesting to perform studies to identify molecules that interact with this new ago clade.

expanded protein families
we have previously identified an expansion of the hsp <dig> gene family in tapeworms  <cit> . in this work, we identified three cestode-specific expanded gene families that could play important roles in the parasites biology: the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, gpcr-proteolytic site  motif-containing protein and glycosyl transferase. the e. canadensis  gps motif-containing protein and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme could be involved in important pathways, such as cell signalling and protein-protein interaction. echinococcus species exhibit an unusual high degree of developmental plasticity and gene expansions that could be explained by these phenomena. glycosyl transferases are involved in glycan biosynthesis and modifications. these important pathways are involved in the biogenesis of the acellular carbohydrate-rich laminated layer, which is an echinococcus-specific trait and one of the morphological traits that differentiate echinococcus species. this expanded gene family presents sequences that are different from known glycosyl transferases. it could be interesting to determine whether the non-canonical enzymes have a metabolic role in metacestode development of each echinococcus species.

phylogenetic relationship among echinococcus species
at present, there is not unequivocal taxonomic classification of echinococcus species neither genomic analysis that reveals particularities among them. the phylogeny studies based on three different approaches allowed us to understand the phylogenetic relationship among these three species. firstly, the reconstruction of the mitochondrial phylogeny from complete mitochondrial genomes confirms the monophyly of the e. canadensis species. moreover; the phylogenetic tree topology of single-copy genes based on amino acid or nucleotide sequences demonstrates the status of e. canadensis , e. multilocularis and e. granulosus  as different species. however, slightly different topologies are observed when protein or nucleotide sequences are used for the phylogeny reconstruction, which make this analysis robust enough to discriminate among species but it is not sufficient to define a common ancestor. furthermore, considering only coding regions, the analyses could be biased due to sampling bias and/or due to the small divergence rate among proteins, therefore the real genetic distance could be underestimated. otherwise, whole-genome sequencing and a snp-based approach provided the requisite level of genetic detail to resolve the paradigm of these echinococcus species. this analysis demonstrates that e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  are phylogenetically more distant to each other due to a higher rate of genetic diversity and suggests that e. multilocularis would be the ancestral species of both. this result is in accordance with the phylogeny reconstructed from single-copy genes based on nucleotide sequences here obtained and with previous studies carried out by saarma et al.  <cit> . the fact that e. canadensis  and e. granulosus  share more homozygous polymorphic loci with the same variant reinforces the hypothesis of a basal e. multilocularis that accumulated mutations over time until a speciation phenomenon occurred. afterwards they would have diverged independently by increasing the genetic diversity. indeed, whole genome sequencing is crucial not only for exposing differences among the species, but also for unequivocally defining the phylogeny and the evolutionary history of these parasites and other species. hence, additional cestode genomes need to be sequenced in order to understand the complete evolutionary history and to obtain an accurate echinococcus phylogeny.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study we are presenting a new genome of echinococcus. we sequenced, assembled and annotated the genome of the human flatworm parasite e. canadensis  which highly contributes to the source of knowledge of the flatworm biology. the present work focused on the description of a group of genes that are involved in parasite development and survival, metabolic features and relevant genomic structures involved in gene expression regulation. and finally; we performed a thorough genetic variability analysis among the echinococcus species that was taken in advantage to perform phylogenetic analyses. these results lay the groundwork for further research of echinococcus phylogeny and many others aspects of the evolutionary history of these parasites. the resources given in this work not only promote the study of parasite developmental mechanisms, but will also provide new tools for drug discovery and control strategies.
