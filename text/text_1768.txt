BACKGROUND
breast cancer is one of the most important oncologic diseases worldwide, and in mexico is the second most frequent neoplasia in women population  <cit> . it is widely accepted that among the factors involved in the development of this ailment are long-standing inflammation and steroid hormone regulation. on this respect, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha  has been postulated as a key player in the tumor microenvironment, but has a paradoxical role in disease evolution: it can act both as a necrotic or as a promoting factor  <cit>  e.g., the endogenous tnf-α chronically produced in the tumor microenvironment enhances both tumor development and spreading, while local administration of high-doses of tnf-α is antiangiogenic and has a powerful anti-tumoral effect  <cit> . it is worth to note that tnf-α acts as a mediator of the apoptotic process and has selective cytotoxicity against malignant breast tumor cells, promoting an apoptotic type of cell death in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> .

tnf-α, a  <dig>  kda polypeptide, elicits a wide range of biological responses, including inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . the binding of tnf-α to the tnf receptor type i  promotes the recruitment of several intracellular adaptors which in turn, activate multiple signal transduction pathways  <cit> . while recruitment of death domain  containing adaptors such as fas associated dd  and tnf-r associated dd  can lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways that induce apoptosis, recruitment of tnf-ri associated factors  can lead to the activation of multiple cell survival intracellular signals such as nf-κb, jnk, p <dig> and erk  <cit> .

glucocorticoids  are essential steroid hormones required for the maintenance of several key physiological and developmental processes. gcs act through binding to the gc receptor , which is followed by gr translocation into the nucleus and trans-activation or trans-repression of target genes  <cit> . in addition, rapid nongenomic effects of gcs have been described  <cit> . there is a dual and cell-type-specific role for gcs in cell death regulation: gcs are able to induce apoptosis in lymphocytes, leukemic cells, lymphomas and multiple myeloma cells . however, in other cell types such as hepatocytes  <cit> , vascular endothelial cells  <cit> , osteoclasts  <cit>  and particularly in mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , gcs can inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of different stimuli. besides, in the human breast tumor derived cell line mcf- <dig> the synthetic gc dexamethasone  is able to completely abrogate the tnf-α-mediated cell death  <cit> . in fact, this system has been recognized as a valuable experimental model to study hormone dependent breast cancer cells. however, and despite many efforts, the mechanism used by dex to interfere with the tnf-α-dependent cell death remains poorly understood.

to investigate the interaction of tnf-α and dex we used the mcf- <dig> cell line and evaluated the contribution of two main routes involved in cell survival: the nuclear factor κb  and the phosphatidyl inositol  <dig> kinase  activated pathways. nf-κb is a heterodimer, typically consisting of the p <dig> and p <dig> monomers, sequestered in the cytoplasm of most un-stimulated cells by members of the family of inhibitory proteins iκb  <cit> . nf-κb is activated by tnf-α through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of iκbs  <cit> . after iκb degradation, nf-κb translocates to the nucleus and binds to κb sites up-regulating a panel of proteins, including the anti-apoptotic proteins  c-iap <dig>  c-iap <dig> and xiap  <cit> . deficiencies in nf-κb activation or interference with the synthesis of new proteins render a cell extremely sensitive to tnf-α induced apoptosis  <cit> .

in addition to their participation in survival and proliferation, pi3k and its target pkb/akt, have emerged as critical signaling molecules that regulate multiple cellular processes  <cit> . the ability of pi3k or akt to suppress apoptosis has been attributed to both, bad and caspase- <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> , as well as ceramide regulation  <cit> . in addition to these anti-apoptotic effects, akt can also contribute activating nik, with the consequent nuclear translocation of nf-κb  <cit> . thus, depending on cell context and cell type, tnf-α is able to induce cell survival or apoptosis pathways.

it has been demonstrated that nf-κb is able to inhibit apoptosis triggered by tnf-α, and that nf-κb activation by both, constitutively active pi3k or akt, suppresses tnf-α-dependent apoptosis in mcf- <dig> and hek  <dig> cells  <cit> . we found that dex protection against a tnf-α-dependent cell death was not affected by the expression of a dominant-negative pi3k mutant protein . however, expression of a non-degradable iκbα mutant protein  completely abrogated dex protection against tnf-α-induced cell death. in addition, expression of dniκbα was accompanied by downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-iap <dig> 

RESULTS
dexamethasone blocks the cytotoxicity of tnf-α in the breast carcinoma-derived cell line mcf-7
in order to determine the sensitivity of mcf- <dig> cells to tnf-α cell cultures were incubated with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng ml- <dig> of tnf-α for different periods of time. cell survival was determined by crystal violet assay . like it was reported before  <cit> , tnf-α showed a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on cell survival. we observed that the minimum cell survival of  <dig>  % was at the highest dose of tnf-α used  at the longest period of incubation . the maximum change in cytotoxicity occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> h with about 80% to 45% survival respectively with a dose of  <dig> ng ml- <dig>  at longer periods of time cell mortality increased even further . to evaluate the range of the protective doses of dex against tnf-α cytotoxicity, mcf- <dig> cells were co-incubated with tnf-α  at different concentrations of dex or its vehicle for  <dig> h . dex protected cells against tnf-α-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner.  <dig> μm dex offered a complete protection against the cytotoxic effect of tnf-α and, at  <dig> μm, had a toxic effect on its own. in subsecuent experiments we used a concentration of dex of  <dig> μm. as shown in figure 1c, dex  <dig> μm was able to prevent the tnf-α-dependent reduction in cell number in mcf- <dig> cultures without any alteration of cellular morphology even after  <dig> h of incubation. to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the protective effects of dex against tnf-α dependent cell death, we evaluated the possible participation of the pi3k and nf-κb survival pathways.

dexamethasone protection from tnf-α cytotoxicity is not mediated by the pi3k/akt pathway
activation of akt is a phosphorylation dependent event mediated by a pi3k dependent kinase  that occurs in response to different extracellular stimuli. as is shown in figure 2a, tnf-α stimulation of mcf- <dig> cells resulted in an increase of the phosphorylated state of akt . dex treatment did not affect the levels of pakt in unstimulated or tnf-α treated cells , suggesting that akt phosphorylation does not participate in dex protection. expression of the pi3k dominant negative mutant  protein in three independent clones, a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  abrogated the tnf-α-associated phosphorylation of akt  without affecting total akt protein levels . it is worth to note that akt activation has been reported to play an important role in iκb degradation and nf-κb activation in diverse cell types  <cit> . to assure that pi3k/akt signal pathway inhibition did not affect the nf-κb survival route, we tested if overexpression of Δp <dig> could alter the iκb degradation and nf-κb nuclear translocation. figure 2c shows that the inhibition of akt phosphorylation by Δp <dig> in the clone  <dig> did not affect the iκb degradation induced by tnf-α stimulation. moreover, the nf-κb activation induced by tnf-α was not affected in these cells . taken together, these results showed that, despite the fact that the Δp <dig> mutant protein was able to interfere with akt activation this did not affect the tnf-α-dependent nf-κb activation.

finally, we evaluated the survival of cells from the three different clones expressing the Δp <dig> mutant protein after tnf-α and dex treatment. as shown in figure 2e, no statistical difference was observed in the protection conferred by dex in any one of the three clones when compared to the parental cell line. dex-dependent protection against tnf-α remained unchanged in cells transfected with the empty vector . these results suggest that the pi3k/akt pathway is not involved in the dex protection against tnf-α cytotoxicity.

nf-κb participates in the dexamethasone protection from a tnf-α mediated cell death
our next goal was to determine the role of nf-κb in the protection conferred by dex analyzing by emsa the nf-κb nuclear translocation after dex treatment in the absence or presence of tnf-α. tnf-α treatment showed two dna/nf-κb complexes ; supershift analysis with anti p <dig> and p <dig> antibodies revealed the presence of p <dig> in both of them, whereas p <dig> was present only in the complex with lower mobility . on its own, dex treatment led to a slight decrease in the nf-kb signal , but it had no effect on the two nf-κb complexes induced by tnf-α. taken together, these results indicate that dex protection does not affect nf-κb activation.

to further analyze the participation of nf-κb in dex protection, a non-degradable recombinant iκbα mutant protein  was transfected into mcf- <dig> cells. endogenous  and recombinant  forms of iκbα were clearly distinguished due to the presence of a tag sequence in the mutant form resulting in a higher molecular weight protein. as expected, wtiκbα was degraded in all clones when stimulated with tnf-α while dniκbα, lacking the two serine phosphorylation sites, was not degraded after tnf-α stimulation . when the clone c <dig>  with a high level of expression of dnikbα, was treated with tnf-α, nf-κb translocation was significantly reduced both in the presence or absence of dex . in contrast, when the clone c <dig>  expressing low levels of dniκbα, was stimulated with tnf-α, nf-κb activation was almost as intense as in the parental mcf- <dig> cells or in those transfected with the empty vector . when cell survival was determined in the different clones after exposure to tnf-α in the presence or absence of dex, we found that dex protection was completely abrogated in the clone expressing high levels of the dniκbα . in addition, the clone c <dig> became more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of tnf-α since cell viability fell by half when compared to the clone c <dig> or parental untransfected cells. in both clones dex protection was dramatically reduced when compared to the parental cell line: viability was indistinguishable from that of cells exposed only to tnf-α . these results suggest a dose-dependent effect of active nf-κb in the protection mediated by dex.

loss of dexamethasone protection in dniκbα expressing cells correlates with a lower c-iap <dig> content
as has been previously reported  <cit> , dex protection against tnf-α cytotoxicity correlates with inhibition of xiap and c-iap <dig> protein degradation. tnf-α exposure resulted in a time dependent decline of both xiap and c-iap <dig> in the parental mcf- <dig> cells . dex treatment alone had no effect on the levels of either of the two antiapoptotic proteins even after  <dig> hrs . simultaneous stimulation with tnf-α and dex led to higher levels of the two proteins when compared to the effect of tnf-α alone , as previously shown  <cit> . when mcf- <dig> cells expressing dniκbα were treated with tnf-α  the downregulation of xiap and, especially that of c-iap <dig>  was accelerated and resulted in lower levels than those reached in parental cells. treatment with tnf-α plus dex led to a differential effect in the two antiapoptotic proteins: in the case of xiap, the protein downregulation time course was similar to that of the parental cells , while in the case of c-iap <dig> the protein downregulation was stimulated in response to dex . these results indicate that only ciap <dig> levels correlate with the protection conferred by dex and with nf-κb activation.

discussion
to contribute to the understanding of cancer genesis, the breast cancer derived cell line mcf- <dig> has been used as a prominent model for the study of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. in mcf- <dig> cells dex is able to prevent the cytotoxic effect of tnf-α, and the anti-apoptotic proteins iap <dig>  iap <dig> and xiap have been postulated as effector molecules  <cit> . however, and despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms of this protection are just beginning to be described. on this respect, the role played by anti-apoptotic routes others than the one regulated by iap proteins in the dex protection from tnf-α cytotoxicity has not been analyzed. also, tnf-α stimulation does not only activate cell death pathways, but survival ones too. in consequence, it can be assumed that the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators defines the apoptotic threshold of a cell. the anti-apoptotic effect of tnf-α requires the activation of pi3k and nf-κb and, as active participants of survival routes, these proteins could participate in the dex protection against tnf-α cytotoxicity. thus, we analyzed their participation in dex mediated-protection against tnf-α cytotoxicity.

it has been suggested that the scarcity of breast tumor derived cell lines has led to the apparition of several sub-lines, evidenced by different results obtained for the evaluation of related phenomena  <cit> , including their susceptibility to tnf-α induced apoptosis  <cit> .

this led us to corroborate the ability of tnf-α to induce cell death and to evaluate the protection mediated by dex in our cell system. as previously reported, tnf-α treatment induced cell death in a dose and time dependent fashion and co-incubation with dex protected mcf- <dig> cells against tnf-α-induced cell death.

we have found that in mcf <dig> and zr-70- <dig> human mammary tumor cells the protective effect of dex was compromised in the presence of  <dig>  μm of bay- <dig>  a pharmacological inhibitor of nf-κb activation . this result correlates with those observed in figure 3d, where protection is lost in cells expressing the dominant negative form of ikbα, thus providing further support to the notion that dex protection requires nf-κb activation. furthermore, the use of the inhibitor of nf-κb lead to a marked decrease in c-iap <dig> cellular content in zr-70- <dig> cells . while c-iap <dig> could not be detected in tnf-α-treated cells, in the presence of tnf-α + dex c-iap <dig> content returned to control levels. this behavior reproduced the results presented in figures 4c and 4d, and documents the correlation between dex protection and c-iap <dig> cellular content.

in our system the akt phosphorylation level was not affected by dex treatment in the presence or absence of tnf-α. besides, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of pi3k  in mcf- <dig> cells did not affect dex protection, suggesting that the pi3k/akt pathway is not involved in dex protection against tnf-α. nf-κb activation through pi3k/akt has been a controversial issue due to cell type variations  <cit> . although in some cells akt acts upstream of nf-κb  <cit> , we found that nf-κb activation is completely independent of akt function.

in our cell system dex did not modify the nf-κb activation in the presence or absence of tnf-α. however, a non-degradable iκbα mutant protein , which prevents nf-κb nuclear translocation; completely blocked dex protection against tnf-α induced cell death. in the absence of dex, dniκbα expression increased the susceptibility to tnf-α-induced death. these results suggest that the tnf-α-dependent nf-κb activation participates in the protection conferred by dex. furthermore, in dnikbα transfectant mcf- <dig> cells, the susceptibility to tnf-α cytotoxicity correlated with the level of expression of the iκbα mutant form, suggesting a threshold for the protective action of nf-κb activation.

nf-κb regulates the expression of a great number of genes, including several antiapoptotic gene products such as members of the bcl- <dig> family  <cit>  and the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, nf-κb regulates xiap  <cit>  and ciap <dig> promoters  <cit> . thus, we analyzed the effects of interfering with nf-κb signaling pathway during dex protection on xiap and c-iap <dig> protein content. we detected that, as previously reported  <cit> , tnf-α-induced apoptosis in mcf- <dig> cells correlated with downregulation of xiap and c-iap <dig> proteins, postulated as effectors of the protective effect against tnf-α-mediated cytotoxicity. however, only the expression level of c-iap <dig> correlated with the protective effect of dex: in cells expressing dniκbα stimulated with tnf-α  the protein level of this antiapoptotic factor was lower than in parental cells and correlated with an increased cell death and,  in parental mcf- <dig> cells dex treatment correlated with a slower rate of decrease of the anti-apoptotic factors content.

while estrogen dependence in mammary tumor cells is being extensively studied due to its clinical importance, the dependency on gc has received less attention. the protection conferred by dex against tnf-mediated cytotoxicity has been extensively analyzed in mcf- <dig> cells and, interestingly, this synthetic gc has also been reported to confer protection against pharmacological mediators of cell death  <cit> . in contrast, gcs have been reported to interfere with proliferation in mcf <dig>  zr-75- <dig>  con- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> mammary tumor cells  <cit> . at present, gc therapy is not included in patients with mammary tumors, although no comparative study has been performed to discard its efficacy. whether or not the antiproliferative effect of natural or synthetic gcs is related to the protection against tnf-mediated cytotoxicity remains to be determined.

also, iaps belong to a diverse group of proteins which modulate the apoptotic pathways by binding to caspases and inhibiting their proteolitic activity  <cit> . in addition to this well characterized anti-apoptotic effect, some iap isoforms have been reported to interfere with apoptosis through caspase-inhibition independent mechanisms. expression of iaps in mcf- <dig> cells in response to dex has been previously described and is suggestive of the anti-apoptotic protection against tnf-mediated cytotoxicity. nevertheless, the contribution of iap expression to this protective effect remains to be shown by specific interference with iaps expression, possibly through irna technology. without this kind of experiments, it is difficult to establish the relative contribution of iap expression to the protective effect of dex.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the protective effect of dex is dependent on tnf-α-mediated activation of nf-κb, and it seems likely that the nf-κb-dependent gene expression of antiapoptotic proteins is strenghtened by dex treatment, probably through the gc receptor. this protection appears to be independent of the pi3k pathway. moreover, gc-receptor activation through dex has been reported to induce the expression of different anti-apoptotic gene products, including c-iap <dig> and xiap  <cit> , serum and gc-inducible protein kinase one , and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase one   <cit> . on this respect, we found the existence of a suggestive correlation between susceptibility against tnf-α-induced cell death and the diminished c-iap expression in the absence of nf-κb translocation. although the interaction among glucocorticoids and cytokines is often cell type specific and depends on the physiologic context of the cell, our data point towards the nf-κb system as a potential therapeutic target in the combat against some hormone-dependent forms of mammary cancer.
