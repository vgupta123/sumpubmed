BACKGROUND
the anterior-posterior  identity of the body axis at the level of the hindbrain and the spinal cord is largely dependent upon the regulated expression of hox gene clusters  <cit> . at early embryogenesis, hox genes are up-regulated sequentially in the epiblast and establish their ordered expression patterns along the a-p axis  <cit> . they also play an instructive role in distributing cells in an ordered manner along the a-p axis during ingression of epiblast cells  <cit> . as a consequence, hox gene expression exhibits nested patterns in the paraxial mesoderm as well as in the neuroepithelium. one unique feature of conferring a-p identity by hox genes is that these nested expression patterns display sharp anterior boundaries, creating codes of expression along the a-p axis  <cit> . for example, expression of paralogue  <dig> hox genes, such as hoxb <dig>  have an anterior-most limit at the rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary, while the anterior most limit of paralogue  <dig> genes lies at the rhombomere 7/ <dig> boundary. thus rhombomere  <dig> is defined as a hox paralogue  <dig> positive and hox paralogue  <dig> negative segment. as evidence of this code-dependent positional identity, null mutant mice of hox genes exhibit the loss of a segmental identity only of the anterior-most domain of the gene expression  <cit> . hence, regulation of hox expression at the anterior-most domain is the most crucial step in the process of conferring a-p identity.

while the expression of hox genes begins at the primitive streak stage, cells are not committed to express specific hox genes and the pattern does not strictly follow the cell lineage. instead, the expression patterns of many hox genes display dynamic changes during neurulation. in addition to hoxb <dig>  as described below in detail , hoxb <dig>  b <dig>  <cit>  and b <dig>  <cit>  in chick and hoxb <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> in mouse  <cit>  have been shown to exhibit dynamic alterations in their expression patterns during axis elongation before the final pattern is established.

what is the possible factor responsible for the dynamic change in hox gene expression in the neural tube? one strong candidate is the influence from flanking somites. it has been shown in chick embryos that transposition of regions of the neural tube along the a-p axis results in the reprogramming of hox codes  <cit> . furthermore, somites have been shown to be able to up-regulate hoxb <dig> when grafted ectopically in regions that do not normally express hoxb <dig>  <cit> . similar results were obtained in zebrafish embryos, where grafting of non-axial mesoderm causes transformation of forebrain to a hindbrain character  <cit> . these observations led to the idea that the neural tube undergoes continual assessment of its environmental signals in order to establish the correct pattern of hox gene expression in the cns after neural tube formation  <cit> .

retinoic acid  is the most likely molecule responsible for the up-regulation of hox genes by the somites. an enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase- <dig> , which converts the inactive form retinaldehyde to ra, is expressed in the somites from early stages of development  <cit> . ra appears to be abundant in the neural tube as well as in the somites  <cit> . cyp1b <dig>  another ra synthesizing enzyme, is also expressed in somites during early embryogenesis  <cit> . in mice, at least, raldh <dig> seems to be the main ra synthesizing enzyme in early embryogenesis at  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, since the ra-responsive transgene rare-hsp-lacz  <cit>  does not show expression in raldh2-/- embryos at these stages except in the eye  <cit> . ra deficiency caused either by genetic deletion of raldh <dig> in mice  <cit>  or by placing quail hens on a ra-deficient diet  <cit>  results in defects in axial development and patterning. the defects do not span the whole hox-territory; rather, the defect is restricted to the posterior hindbrain , demonstrating that this region requires correct ra levels  <cit> .

to account for the complex organization of hox genes by signaling mechanisms, a number of models have been proposed. for example, individual hox genes have specific retinoic acid response elements  with different sensitivities to ra, thereby allowing each hox gene to be controlled differently depending on the concentration of ra  <cit> . another example of differential regulation of hox genes is by fgf signaling, where some hox genes have the binding sequence for a downstream transcription factor, cdx, in their enhancers  <cit> . in addition to the above, it is likely that there are more mechanisms that are responsible for establishing the correct a-p pattern, such as the duration of exposure to signals, the degree of dependence on signals, the involvement of planar signaling, and the competence of the neural tube to respond to signals. this study aims at clarifying two issues. first, to what extent does endogenous hox expression depend upon the somite signal? second, what determines the competence of the neural tube to respond to the somite signal? in order to address these questions, hoxb <dig> has been chosen as a model because the dynamic changes in its expression pattern occur at the stages when the tissues involved are accessible for refined dissections. the chick explant culture system was employed to identify tissue interactions that are responsible for the up-regulation of hoxb <dig> expression in the neural tube.

RESULTS
the dynamics of hoxb <dig> expression in the developing chick neural tube
we first investigated in detail the changes in the hoxb <dig> expression pattern that occur after neurulation. hoxb <dig> is first detectable at the full streak stage   <cit>  and the anterior-most boundary resides at the level of the future 6th somite both in the mesoderm and the neural tube until the  <dig> somite stage   <cit>  . this level is about  <dig> somite segments more posterior than the final anterior-most boundary of neural tube expression, the rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary, which corresponds to the anterior edge of the 1st somite. during somite stages  <dig> to  <dig> , which is approximately a difference of  <dig> hours, the expression pattern rapidly changes exclusively in the neural tube; the domain here extends anteriorly while mesodermal expression remains at the same level . expression extends until it finally establishes its anterior most limit at the future rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary. this does not involve cell movement as cells in the neural tube maintain their relative positions to the flanking somite at these stages  <cit> . during somite stages 10– <dig> , the expression becomes stronger while the domain remains unchanged . by the  <dig> somite stage , the rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary is formed and the hoxb <dig> domain is clearly defined .

signals from the mesoderm are necessary for the initial up-regulation of hoxb4
although it has been previously shown that somites are capable of inducing hoxb <dig> in ectopic locations  <cit> , it is not known whether somites are required for the endogenous up-regulation of hoxb <dig>  if so, at which stage are they required and are they sufficient for the correct patterning of the neural tube in normal development? in order to address these questions, the somite level 1– <dig> region was analyzed using the explant culture system. first, in order to test whether the initiation of hoxb <dig> expression in the neural tube is recapitulated in the explant culture system, the neural tube at somite level 1– <dig> including flanking somites, as well as surface ectoderm, notochord and endoderm, were dissected from embryos between  <dig> and  <dig> somite stages. it was found that, in all explants dissected at the above stages, hoxb <dig> expression was up-regulated in the neural tube along the axial length after  <dig> hours of culture . presence or absence of notochord did not have an effect on the result . next, in order to investigate the requirement of somites, the neural tube was dissected without somites  and compared to a neural tube that included flanking somites . the results show that neural explants taken between somite stages 3– <dig> did not show any up-regulation of hoxb <dig> after  <dig> hours . some weak expression was observed in the posterior half when the explant was taken at the  <dig> somite stage . conversely, from the  <dig> somite stage onwards, the removal of somites did not affect the level of expression , indicating that somites are not required at these stages.

at a given a-p level, signals from the somites are not sufficient to up-regulate hoxb <dig> expression
the requirement of somites in the above experiment led us to consider whether each somite is solely responsible for inducing hoxb <dig> at the same level of neural tube. in other words, at a particular level of the neural tube, are the adjacent somites sufficient to pattern this level or not? in order to test this, the neural tubes of  <dig> to  <dig> somite stage embryos were dissected at each somite level including somites . after  <dig> hours, it was found that posterior levels  strongly expressed hoxb <dig> in the neural tube , whereas neural tube at somite levels  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited weaker hoxb <dig> expression . the neural tube at somite level  <dig> displayed no expression . these results suggest the following:  vertical signals  alone are not sufficient, and hence planar communication and signaling in the neural tube along the a-p axis are to be considered.  different axial levels exhibit different degrees of vertical signaling, either by posterior somites producing a greater signal than anterior ones or by different axial levels of the neural tube responding differently to the somite signal, or both. there are two pieces of evidence that support the idea that somites send different degrees of signal strength to the neural tube. firstly, ectopic somite grafting showed that the more posterior somites have a stronger inducing capability in the adjacent neural tube  <cit> . second, raldh <dig> is expressed strongly in posterior somites whereas there is very little or no expression in somite  <dig>  <cit>  . in fact, the ability of each somite to induce hoxb <dig> expression in the adjacent neural tube, both ectopically  <cit>  and at endogenous locations , coincides spatially and temporally with the graded expression of raldh <dig> in somites . however, there is some discrepancy in considering raldh <dig> as the sole factor responsible for up-regulating hoxb4: at the  <dig> somite stage when hoxb <dig> is being up-regulated but is not yet being expressed in anterior regions , raldh <dig> has already been down-regulated at most of the somite 1– <dig> levels . in addition, while the hoxb <dig> expression domain extends anteriorly during the course of development, raldh <dig> expression is down-regulated in an anterior to posterior direction . another ra synthesizing enzyme, cyp1b <dig>  is expressed in somites at young stages without any significant down-regulation  <cit> . however, despite the expression of cyp1b <dig> in somites, anterior somites such as  <dig> and  <dig> failed to fully up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the adjacent neural tube in the above experiment . these results led us to further analyze the role of somites in up-regulating hoxb <dig> in the neural tube.

the above experiments suggest that the ability of somites to induce hox genes in the adjacent neural tube is not simply determined by the production of ra. other factors to be considered include the identity of the hox gene, the relative timing of up-regulation of hox genes and ra production, and the a-p position within the hox gene expression domain. in order to address these, we used hoxb <dig> as another hox marker. hoxb <dig> has an anterior-most expression domain at the rhombomere 5/ <dig> boundary and establishes its final expression pattern at the  <dig> somite stage, slightly earlier than hoxb <dig>  <cit> . we first confirmed using the explant culture method that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> requires flanking somites at the  <dig> somite stage, in a similar manner to hoxb <dig> . by dissecting somite level  <dig> neural tube along with flanking somites, it was observed that somite  <dig> is sufficient to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the adjacent neural tube . hence, the 1st somite is not incapable of inducing hox genes; the failure to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in somite level  <dig> neural tube is not due to the specific feature of the 1st somite; rather, different signal strengths are required for the up-regulation of different hox genes. nevertheless, the result of dissecting neural tube and flanking somites at each of the somite levels  <dig> to  <dig>  is in clear contrast to the result of explanting the neural tube and somites as a whole , where the neural tube displays homogenous expression along its axial length. these data suggest that vertical signals alone are not sufficient and planar communication or signaling is required.

involvement of planar signaling
to directly test the possible involvement of planar signaling, attempts were made to block planar signaling in the neural tube explant. neural tube from a  <dig> somite stage embryo was dissected from somite level 1– <dig> including adjacent somites. a foil barrier was placed in the neural tube at the level of the somite 2/ <dig> boundary  . positioning the barrier in such a manner would block the possible occurrence of planar signals, yet still allow the transmission of vertical signals at each level. following a 24-hour culture, hoxb <dig> failed to be up-regulated significantly in the neural tube at somite level  <dig> and  <dig> . this implies that the placement of a barrier did block transmission of signals travelling anteriorly through the plane of the neural tube. weak expression present in the region anterior to the barrier might be attributed to vertical signals coming from somites immediately adjacent to the neural tube.

barrier-placing experiments were further conducted using whole embryos at the  <dig> somite stage, by placing a barrier posterior to the 2nd somite . the barrier was placed across the neural tube as well as all other tissues including somites. embryos were incubated ex ovo on albumen-agar plates  <cit> , which helped stable positioning of the barrier. after 24– <dig> hours of incubation, hoxb <dig> induction on the anterior side of the barrier was found to be clearly blocked, either completely  or to significantly low levels compared to the posterior side of the barrier  . this result is consistent with the above experiment of explant culture suggesting planar signaling; however, it is not in agreement with the study by gaunt and strachan  where the hoxd <dig> expression domain was shown to 'spread forward' regardless of physical barrier after  <dig> hours of culture. the reason for this discrepancy is not clear. one possible explanation is that ex ovo culture may cause delays in chick development and hoxd4/b <dig> might be up-regulated after a longer incubation, although embryos incubated ex ovo in the same condition without barriers showed a clear up-regulation of hoxb <dig> as normal . however, there was one case showing strong hoxb <dig> induction anterior to the barrier , suggesting that the results may vary among the cases. nonetheless, both our explant and in vivo studies suggest the requirement of tissue continuity in up-regulating hoxb <dig> in the neural tube, suggesting involvement of planar signaling. the planar signaling may be required for the initial extension in expression, and/or the maintenance of the expression initiated by signals from flanking somites.

given the importance of planar signaling in the neural tube, it was next asked whether anterior somites are required for the planar signaling or not. somites  <dig> and  <dig>  although unable to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the adjacent neural tube in a vertical manner , are still required for hoxb <dig> expression, since removal of somites  <dig> and  <dig> from the explant of somite level 1– <dig> abolished up-regulation of hoxb <dig> in the anterior neural tube . this could be because somites are either required for instructive vertical signals or for sending permissive cues that allow the anterior neural tube to respond to planar signals. we have noticed that the neural tube and somites from level  <dig> or  <dig> cause a stronger induction in the level  <dig> neural tube compared to those from more anterior levels such as levels 1– <dig> . we therefore designed experiments where a neural explant dissected at somite levels 1– <dig>  was combined with a level  <dig> neural tube with flanking somites . following a  <dig> hour culture, significant up-regulation of hoxb <dig> was seen in the anterior neural tube in an area approximately one somite diameter in length . hence, the neural tube is able to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the absence of flanking somites when combined with a more posterior neural tube with somites. in a similar experiment where the neural explant of somite level 1– <dig> was combined with a level  <dig> neural tube, where all levels included somites, it was noted that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> was fully extended to the anterior-most end of the explant , despite that these anterior somites are not capable of sufficiently up-regulating hoxb <dig> in the adjacent neural tube . these results demonstrate that somites  <dig> and  <dig> are required for up-regulation of hoxb <dig> in the neural tube, at least in part to assist in the response of the neural tube to planar signaling, suggesting a synergistic effect between planar and vertical signals.

dorso-ventral difference of hox gene expression
the above results collectively demonstrate that vertical signals do not sufficiently establish the correct expression pattern of hoxb <dig>  this led us to consider the possibility of a factor located within the neural tube that may be able to affect or modulate the response of the neural tube to the somite signal. in line with investigating factors that facilitate the neural tube to express hoxb <dig>  we have noticed that the neural tube shows a considerable difference in hox gene expression along the dorso-ventral  axis, where the dorsal side expresses more strongly than the ventral side during the course of up-regulation at 10– <dig> somite stages . transverse sections clearly show that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> begins at the dorsal-most side of the neural tube, with this d-v difference being seen at all axial levels at these stages . it is noticeable that the dorsal side of the neural tube, which is where hoxb <dig> is strongly expressed initially, does not necessarily have close contact with the flanking somites , suggesting that up-regulation in the dorsal side cannot be explained solely by somitic signals. at the  <dig> somite stage, the d-v difference is less evident, except that the floor plate does not express hoxb <dig> . at the  <dig> somite stage, the neural tube shows homogeneous expression of hoxb <dig> along the d-v axis except in the floor plate .

there is additional evidence indicating that the dorsal side of the neural tube precedes the ventral side in hoxb <dig> expression: when the neural tube is translocated posteriorly, the graft up-regulates hoxb <dig> in response to the new posterior environment. in this situation, the dorsal side of the graft expresses hoxb <dig> earlier than the ventral side  <cit> . in another situation, where somites are grafted anteriorly into the pre-otic region causing ectopic induction of hox genes, hoxb <dig> up-regulation can be seen predominantly in the dorsal edge of the neural tube, which is particularly the case when anterior somites with weak inductive abilities are used  <cit> . furthermore, during the normal course of development , there is a transient up-regulation of hoxb <dig> in the dorsal rim of rhombomere  <dig> while the anterior-most limit of the main expression domain is at the rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary  <cit> . these observations collectively imply that the dorsal side of the neural tube might have a greater susceptibility to expressing hox genes than the ventral region.

bmp signals are involved in up-regulating hoxb <dig> in the neural tube
the above observations prompted us to investigate the cause of the dorsal precedence, since this may provide us with a key to understanding the susceptibility of the neural tube to expressing hoxb <dig>  there are two possibilities that may account for this d-v difference in hox expression:  the dorsal region of the somite is sending a stronger signal to the neural tube than the ventral region.  the somite is sending a uniform strength of signal to the neural tube along its d-v axis, but the dorsal neural tube is more responsive to this signal than the ventral neural tube. to investigate whether the dorsal region of the somite is transmitting a stronger signal to the neural tube than the ventral region, ectopic induction of hoxb <dig> was reassessed using dorso-ventrally rotated somites. a single somite was taken from a posterior level of a 8– <dig> somite stage embryo   <cit>  and ectopically grafted, while either preserving or reversing the d-v orientation, into the region adjacent to prospective rhombomere  <dig> of a stage-matching host embryo . following a 24– <dig> hour culture, when the ectopic induction was clearly observed, expression of hoxb <dig> in the rhombomere  <dig> region was not significantly different between the cases of rotated and non-rotated somites . therefore, it is unlikely that the dorsal region of the somite is sending a stronger signal than the ventral region; rather the somite conveys a uniform strength of signal along its d-v axis. this raises the possibility that the neural tube itself is responding differently along its d-v axis to the somite signal, where the dorsal neural tube is more responsive to the somite signal than ventral regions.

an obvious feature of the dorsal neural tube is its contact with the surface ectoderm and subsequent expression of bmp ligands and other dorsal neural tube markers such as msx1/ <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit> . it has been shown that a neural explant induces dorsal markers msx1/ <dig> in response to contact with the surface ectoderm  <cit> . in fact, transverse sections of an embryo at the  <dig> somite stage revealed that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> appears to occur most strongly in the region where the neural tube is in contact with the surface ectoderm . hence, an experiment was conducted to determine whether hoxb <dig> expression is up-regulated in response to the dorsalizing signal from the ectoderm in vivo. the dorsal neural tube  was ablated at the level of prospective somites 1– <dig> on one side together with the surface ectoderm immediately overlying the neural tube . in some cases, a foil barrier was placed at the edge of the surface ectoderm to prevent it from regenerating and fusing to the dorsal neural tube . the ablation was conducted on  <dig> to  <dig> somite stage embryos, after which they were incubated until the 10– <dig> somite stage. without a foil barrier, the surface ectoderm rapidly regenerated within  <dig> hours following ablation and formed a continuous epithelial layer with the ablated end of the neural tube. in these cases, up-regulation of msx <dig> was seen at the dorsal tip of the ablated side of the neural tube , as was hoxb <dig> . in contrast, in cases where regeneration of the surface ectoderm was inhibited by the barrier, neither msx <dig>  nor hoxb <dig>  were up-regulated. this suggests that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> in the dorsal neural tube is associated with contact with the surface ectoderm and subsequent dorsalization of the neural tube.

bmp <dig> requires ra signalling to up-regulate hoxb4
since the dorsalization of the neural tube by the surface ectoderm is known to be mediated by bmp signaling  <cit> , we next directly tested whether bmp signaling up-regulates hoxb <dig>  embryos at 4– <dig> somite stages were cultured ex ovo  <cit>  using either conditioned medium of hek <dig> cells transfected with bmp <dig> or recombinant bmp <dig>  and analyzed at  <dig> to  <dig> somite stages when the d-v difference of hoxb <dig> expression was prominent in a control condition. embryos treated with bmp <dig> displayed a significant ventral expansion of hoxb <dig> expression in the neural tube, while maintaining the anterior-most limit at the rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary . this difference was not prominent at later stages when control embryos also express hoxb <dig> ventrally . hence the result suggests that bmp <dig> may facilitate the neural tube to up-regulate hoxb <dig> ventrally.

since ra is able to up-regulate the expression of hoxb <dig> and is known as the likely candidate for the somite-derived signals, the possible mechanism for up-regulating hoxb <dig> expression by bmp <dig> was further examined to determine if bmp <dig> is capable of up-regulating hoxb <dig> independently of ra or whether bmp <dig> requires ra in order to up-regulate hoxb <dig>  with the aim of blocking ra signaling, embryos at 4– <dig> somite stages were cultured ex ovo in the presence of a ra receptor antagonist, bms <dig>  <cit> . bms493-treated embryos failed to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the neural tube at the level of somites 1– <dig>  when observed at both the 10– <dig> and  <dig> somite stages . this was consistent with the result seen in vitamin a deficient quail and raldh2-/- mouse embryos  <cit> . in the presence of bms <dig>  additional bmp <dig> protein did not up-regulate hoxb <dig> expression at the level of somites  <dig> to  <dig> . therefore it is suggested that, during the course of hoxb <dig> up-regulation at the level of somites  <dig> to  <dig>  ra is absolutely required and bmp <dig> cannot compensate for its absence. this was supported by explant culture experiments, where the neural tube at the level of somites  <dig> to  <dig> was dissected without flanking somites and cultured in the presence of ra or bmp <dig> . while exogenous ra sufficiently up-regulated hoxb <dig> expression in the neural tube explant , bmp <dig> was not able to do so , suggesting that bmp <dig> cannot exert its function to up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the absence of somites. hence, while ra plays an instructive role in the up-regulation of hoxb <dig>  bmp4's role is likely to be permissive rather than instructive.

we further investigated whether ra is able to promote ventral expansion of hoxb <dig> expression in a similar manner to bmp <dig> in vivo. while bmp <dig> showed clear up-regulation in the ventral side of the neural tube , exogenous ra only enhanced the dorsally dominant hoxb <dig> expression and did not show up-regulation in the ventral neural tube as significantly as bmp <dig> did . the result that exogenous ra cannot up-regulate hoxb <dig> in the ventral neural tube while bmp <dig> can, underscores a distinct role of bmp signaling in the in vivo context. collectively, these results suggest a two-phase model in establishing hoxb <dig> expression in the axial level of somite 1– <dig>  first hoxb <dig> is up-regulated at the dorsal neural tube by signals from the surface ectoderm, likely mediated by bmp or tgfβ signaling . ra is required for the dorsal patterning process , and hence this initial phase likely employs both signals. second, hoxb <dig> expression spreads more ventrally, which can be promoted by exogenous bmp <dig> but not by ra. however, this process does not occur in the absence of ra, at least at the somite level  <dig> to  <dig>  it is not clear in the experiment of figure  <dig> using bms <dig> in vivo, whether the requirement of ra is only in the initial step at the dorsal side, or also in the up-regulation at the ventral side. however, the result that after removal of dorsal neural tube, the remaining ventral neural tube shows hoxb <dig> expression in a comparable manner to the control side  suggests that ra/somite up-regulates hoxb <dig> at the ventral side independently of the preceding dorsal expression. given the direct role of ra on the hoxb <dig> enhancer  <cit> , the data suggest distinct functions of ra and bmp signals for up-regulating hoxb <dig> in the ventral neural tube, where ra provided by somites functions as an essential signal, while bmp <dig> functions as a factor facilitating the neural tube to respond to the ra/somite signal.

it was noted that, in the neural tube at the level posterior to the 7th somite, bmp <dig> is able to up-regulate hoxb <dig> even in the presence of bms <dig> . this axial level does not require ra signaling for hoxb <dig> expression  <cit> . hence there remains a possibility that bmp signals may be able to up-regulate hoxb <dig> independent of ra.

dorsalization of the neural tube precedes up-regulation of hoxb4
we further examined whether the up-regulation of hoxb <dig> by bmp <dig> is a direct effect of activation of bmp pathway, or as a consequence of the dorsalized feature of the neural tube. consistent with the result of embryo cultures with exogenous bmp <dig>  electroporation of bmp <dig> in the neural tube at the  <dig> somite stage followed by 6– <dig> hours of incubation caused a noticeable up-regulation of hoxb <dig> expanded toward the ventral side . this was accompanied by up-regulation of other dorsal neural markers such as msx <dig>  and pax <dig> . electroporation of a gfp construct did not show any changes . hence, the d-v pattern of the neural tube has already been altered by the time we observe the changes in the hoxb <dig> expression. next, the same stage of neural tube was electroporated with smad <dig> to test the requirement of bmp signals for hoxb <dig> expression. smad <dig> blocks transduction of bmp and tgfβ signals at the intracellular level  <cit> . smad <dig> successfully inhibited hoxb <dig> expression at the dorsal side of the neural tube . however, the down-regulation was not seen at  <dig>  or  <dig> hours  but at  <dig> hours of incubation , which was presumably due to the late onset of exogenous smad <dig> expression, which might not be prompt enough to override the endogenous programme. in fact, smad <dig> electroporation caused down-regulation of msx1/ <dig> not at  <dig> hours, but after  <dig>  and  <dig> hours . these data suggest that hoxb <dig> expression is preceded by the bmp signal-dependent dorsalization of the neural tube. it should be noted that the dorsalizing activity of exogenous bmp <dig> could be mediated by other members of the tgfβ super family whose function bmp <dig> can mimic. because of the delay in the change in hoxb <dig> following smad <dig> electroporation, and the fact that no known smad binding sites have been identified in hox gene enhancer elements, it is likely that up-regulation of hoxb <dig> is due to the dorsal feature of the neural tube induced by bmp signals, rather than the direct effect of activation of the bmp pathway.

discussion
many previous studies have focused on vertical signals during the process of neural a-p patterning. while ra is likely to be the main signal derived from somites, it has been difficult to explain the neural a-p patterning process solely by ra/somite signals. the aim of this study is to shed light on new aspects other than the factor derived from somites, that is, ectoderm-derived bmp/tgfβ signals and the subsequent acquired competence of the neural tube to respond to the somite/ra signal, together with planar signaling. this work also highlights a mechanism where ra and bmp <dig> act in a concerted manner to initiate neural hoxb <dig> expression.

vertical and planar signaling
the classical idea of vertical and planar signaling has been proposed in studies of neural induction and patterning in amphibian embryos  <cit> . with regard to neural a-p patterning, nieuwkoop proposed that extrinsic 'caudal influences' originate from the mesoderm  <cit>  whereas others showed that planar signals alone can induce neural a-p pattern based on experiments with exogastrula embryos and keller's explants  <cit> . hence the role of vertical and planar signals in amphibian gastrulae remains debatable.

this work has focused on the process of neural patterning long after neural induction, revealed by up-regulation of hoxb <dig>  it has been demonstrated that vertical signals from somites are required but not solely responsible for the establishment of the hoxb <dig> pattern . additional signals emanating from more posterior tissues  work in conjunction with the vertical signals to up-regulate hoxb <dig> expression in anterior regions. these signals travel within the plane of the neural tube , however, the source and identity of the planar signal remains to be determined. based on the requirement of flanking somites for planar signaling , we suggest that somites provide not only instructive signals for hoxb <dig> up-regulation but also permissive signals that assist in planar signaling.

other studies have also suggested the existence of planar signals. this includes experiments where rhombomeres were transposed and incorporated at different a-p levels of the neuroepithelium. induction of hox genes was only observed in the grafted fragment of tissue providing the graft was perfectly incorporated into the host's neuroepithelium  <cit> . this suggested that the inducing signals are being transduced along the plane of the neural tube. in contrast, studies by others have discounted the possibility of planar signals. analysis of the anterior extension of the hoxd <dig> expression domain demonstrated that tissue continuity was not required in order for hoxd <dig> expression to be established  <cit> . implantation of a glass barrier in the neural tube of a  <dig> somite stage embryo posterior to the 2nd somites did not prevent the extension of hoxd <dig> expression, thus implying that planar signals are not necessary after the stage at which the glass barrier was placed. this experiment was reassessed in the present study using the ex ovo culture system with hoxb <dig> as a marker . the result showed a variable yet significant block of hoxb <dig> induction at the anterior side of the barrier, suggesting that tissue continuity is indeed required during the normal course of hoxb <dig> up-regulation.

the actual mode of action of the planar signal remains elusive. it is possible that one hoxb4-expressing cell activates hoxb <dig> expression in the cell adjacent to it. this idea comes from an observation in xenopus embryos, where injection of hoxb <dig> mrna into one blastomere causes induction of endogenous hoxb <dig> expression outside of the injected lineage  <cit> , suggesting that hoxb <dig> expression is able to induce its expression in adjacent cells in a cell non-autonomous manner.

the mode of action of the somite signal is influenced by the competence of the neural tube
this study, as well as previous work by others, has shown that in order to establish hoxb <dig> expression in the neural tube, ra from the adjacent somites is required  <cit> . however, as seen from transverse sections of normal embryos , the somite, although adjacent to the neural tube, is not necessarily close to the dorsal side of the neural tube, which is where hoxb <dig> is strongly expressed initially. this raises the question of how the neural tube exploits the ra/somite signal to initiate hoxb <dig> expression. somite rotation experiments showed no evidence of d-v difference in the strength of inducing ability in somites. this is in agreement with the expression pattern of raldh <dig>  which shows homogeneous expression along the d-v axis of the somites  <cit> . our data suggest that ra is provided evenly at the dorsal and ventral sides of the neural tube, and it is the action of bmps or other members of the tgfβ super family that may sensitize the dorsal neural tube to the ra signal, causing stronger hoxb <dig> expression dorsally.

the effect of d-v differences in establishing the regional specificity along the a-p axis
this work has suggested that bmp signaling is involved in rendering the neural tube competent to express hoxb <dig> in response to ra or somite signals. since bmp signaling is a specific feature of the dorsalization of the neural tube, this provides evidence that establishment of the hoxb <dig> expression pattern, and hence establishment of a-p positional identity, is under the influence of d-v specific cellular characters, demonstrating interplay between the patterning of these two axes.

the phenomenon of a-p positional markers being initially up-regulated at the dorsal side of the neural tube is common in many hox genes in the spinal cord and in krox <dig> in rhombomere  <dig>  <cit> . however, it should be noted that the d-v difference might be only to influence the initial up-regulation and not to affect the expression domains of each hox gene along the a-p axis. genetically modified animals with affected d-v patterning in the neural tube, such as zebrafish embryos with compromised bmp signaling  <cit>  and mouse embryos with deficiency in shh signals  <cit> , exhibit correct a-p patterns. therefore the dorsal specific features are, at most, to facilitate the establishment of the a-p patterns and not to give a clue for the correct a-p patterns. in fact, over-expression of bmp <dig> causes a ventral expansion of hoxb <dig> only at the specific a-p level where hoxb <dig> is normally expressed, and never anteriorly beyond the normal rhombomere 6/ <dig> boundary . thus the mechanism to prevent the anterior extension of expression domains is yet to be clarified.

the effect of ra on hoxb <dig> up-regulation
ra signaling is important not only in rhombomere patterning along the a-p axis but also in specifying the dorsal neural tube. quail embryos deficient in ra exhibit a great loss of dorsal neural tube-specific markers such as bmp4/ <dig>  msx <dig> and pax3/6/ <dig>  <cit> . however, ra does not appear to be sufficient for dorsalization of the neural tube. it is rather bmp <dig> that is responsible for dorsalization  <cit> . hence it appears that ra is required to exert bmp4's dorsalizing activity. another example of ra functioning in such a supporting manner is observed in the ventral neural tube during motor neuron differentiation. ra is required for the shh signal to induce olig <dig> in the ventral spinal cord  <cit> . again, ra is not sufficient to induce olig <dig> in the absence of shh signaling; it is shh which induces olig <dig>  hence, in these contexts, ra acts as a factor to render the neural tube competent to other extrinsic signals such as shh and bmp <dig>  in the case of hoxb <dig>  it has been shown that ra works directly as an inducer of hoxb <dig> expression through an rare in its enhancer  <cit> . in addition to this, the present study proposes that ra might also act to maintain the dorsal-specific domain that serves as an 'initial up-regulation area' for hoxb <dig>  which is likely induced by ectoderm-derived bmp4/tgfβ signals. furthermore, our data showed distinct functions of ra and bmp signals: excess ra expands the hoxb <dig> expressing domain anteriorly  <cit>  but not ventrally , while excess bmp <dig> facilitates its ventral expansion. however, bmp <dig> cannot accomplish ventral expansion of hoxb <dig> in the absence of ra . hence ra and bmp <dig> are mutually required for hoxb <dig> expression both in the dorsal domain as well as in the more ventral side of the neural tube.

CONCLUSIONS
the mechanism of up-regulating hoxb <dig> after neural tube formation was investigated. while vertical signals from somites are necessary for up-regulating hoxb <dig> expression in the adjacent neural tube, these signals are not always instructive in nature; especially in the anterior-most region of the hoxb <dig> expressing domain, the flanking somites do not sufficiently up-regulate its expression in the adjacent neural tube, yet they are necessary to provide permissive cues that allow the neural tube to respond to planar signals. hoxb <dig> is initially up-regulated at the dorsal neural tube, with this up-regulation correlating with the dorsalized character of the neural tube. moreover, somite/ra-dependent up-regulation of hoxb <dig> is promoted by bmp signals. these data suggest that establishment of the hoxb <dig> expression pattern, and hence establishment of a-p positional identity, is under the influence of d-v specific cellular characters, demonstrating interplay between the patterning of these two axes.
