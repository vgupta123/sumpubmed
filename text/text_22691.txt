BACKGROUND
insect cell lines are essential for basic studies of insect viruses and arboviruses and represent critical components in the baculovirus expression vector system. in addition insect cell lines have been used for studies of immunological, toxicological, and hormonal responses  <cit> . for instance, hemocyte-like cell lines have been used to characterize signaling pathways and other processes regulating hemocyte immune responses  <cit>  and an epidermal cell line derived from the integument of helicoverpa armigera showed gene expression responses to 20-hydroxyecdysone  <cit> . an insect specific scorpion toxin, aait, was demonstrated to be highly toxic to sf <dig> cells but not to a human mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . new cell lines that are permissive for replication of the autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus  have potential for use in biotechnological applications related to the baculovirus expression vector  system. specifically, cell lines that provide improved protein production or post-translational processing are particularly desirable as they have the promise of higher protein yields, and may provide more biologically active or useful recombinant proteins for research, therapeutics, or vaccine production. for applications in biotechnology, desirable characteristics of an insect cell line include rapid growth , adaptation to and rapid growth in large-scale suspension cultures, growth in serum-free media, and susceptibility to infection by acmnpv and/or other expression vectors. an additional factor in the utility of an insect cell line is the possible presence of adventitious agents. in some cases, the presence of such agents may pose no difficulties. in other cases, cell lines that are free of adventitious agents are more highly desirable since industrial production of human therapeutic proteins or vaccine candidates must adhere to rigorous specifications related to purity and content.

the baculovirus acmnpv is one of the most commonly used and well-developed of eukaryotic protein expression vectors. this is due in large part to the so-called hyper expression of genes inserted under the control of the polyhedrin promoter of this virus. while very late genes of acmnpv are expressed at extremely high levels, the level of expression achieved from heterologous proteins may vary considerably in different cell lines. lines such as the high five  cell line have been used widely since they were initially shown to produce as much as  <dig> fold higher levels of heterologous protein when compared with standard sf <dig> cell lines  <cit> . while the high five cell line likely represents the most highly productive cell line currently in widespread use, there remains enormous potential for development of new cell lines from different insect species, from different tissue sources, and by engineering existing cell lines for specific improvements.

in the current studies, we generated primary cell cultures and individual cell lines from eggs of the black witch moth , a large moth indigenous to central and north america. here we describe the generation and analysis of single-cell derived lines from primary cultures, and the characterization of one line, ao <dig>  to examine the potential utility of ao <dig> cells, we measured the production of secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase  and β-galactosidase expressed from recombinant acmnpv baculoviruses. we also examined cell growth under various conditions and found that ao <dig> cells adapted readily to serum-free culture medium and to a suspension culture system. we also found that ao <dig> cells appear to be free of an alphanodavirus that was recently reported to latently or persistently infect high five cells.

RESULTS
primary ascalapha odorata cell cultures and cell line cloning
primary cultures of cells were generated from ascalapha odorata egg tissue suspensions in various dilutions of tnmfh medium. floating and attached cells were separated and maintained separately. seventy-seven days after primary cultures were initiated, several isolated colonies of cells were observed in culture flasks containing attached cells  although vigorous cell proliferation occurred only in culture  <dig> aa which contained three distinct foci of cells producing proliferating cells at the edge of dark brown flat tissue explants. two foci producing cells with different shapes and sizes are shown in fig.  <dig>  minor foci producing proliferating cells were also present in culture  <dig> aa. the parental culture consisting of mixed cells derived from  <dig> aa was named aop  and was first sub-cultured  <dig> days after the primary cell culture was initiated. aop was initially passed at  <dig> -  <dig> day intervals  and later by similar dilution at 3-day intervals. single cell-derived lines were generated by dilution of cells from the  <dig> aa primary culture in 96-well plates, and single cells were confirmed by visual screening. twenty-three rapidly growing cell lines were obtained from  <dig> single cell-derived ao cell lines generated in this manner. some of the rapidly growing cell lines showed variation in morphology, size, and aggregation .

susceptibility to acmnpv infection
in preliminary studies, aop and aof1-f <dig> cells were challenged with wt acmnpv at  <dig> iu/cell. acmnpv virus infection and replication were observed in all cultures. rapidly growing ao cell lines  were initially screened by analyzing protein production from cell lines infected with a recombinant acmnpv  that expresses secreted alkaline phosphatase   <cit> . based on that analysis, cell line ao <dig>  was selected for further studies. a recombinant acmnpv expressing β-galactosidase  was also used to evaluate the ao <dig> cell line for susceptibility to viral infection and for analysis of recombinant protein production  <cit>  .

morphology and growth characteristics
similar to the morphology of high five cells, ao <dig> cells have a flat spindle-like shape in tnmfh medium . based on microscopic examination, the average cell size of ao <dig> cells appeared similar to that of high five cells although the general morphology shows slight differences in cell shape, with high five cells exhibiting slightly longer cell extensions. some cell aggregates were observed in ao <dig> cell culture as cell densities approached confluency and this was observed in both tnmfh and sf-900iii media. aggregates of cells appeared to consist of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> cells.

adaptation to serum-free medium
adaptation of ao <dig> cells from tnmfh medium into serum free medium  was performed in two steps, by incrementally lowering the fbs concentration over a  <dig> day period. thereafter, the culture was passed by diluting cells 1: <dig> in fresh medium. the interval between the passages decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> days over time . during adaptation to sf-900iii medium, the cell morphology changed slightly, becoming more rounded. after adapting ao <dig> cells to sf-900iii medium, we also attempted to adapt ao <dig> cells to several other commercially available serum-free media formulations, including sf-900ii, ex-cell  <dig>  express v, and esf <dig>  ao <dig> cells cultured in sf-900ii and ex-cell  <dig> media were maintained for several passages without apparent ill effects. however, in those media the cells later began dividing more slowly and showing irregular shapes and sizes, and granules were observed in the cytoplasm. express v and esf <dig> media did not initially support growth of sf-900iii-adapted ao <dig> cells  and extended efforts were not attempted.

adaptation to suspension culture
after >  <dig> passages of ao <dig> cells in sf-900iii medium in t-flasks, the cells were used to establish a suspension  culture. approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml  were added to a  <dig> ml erlenmeyer flask  and placed on a shaker platform at  <dig> rpm. after growth for approximately 3- <dig> days in shaker cultures, cell aggregates were removed by placing the flask on a stationary platform and allowing aggregates to settle for 3- <dig> min. the single and less aggregated cells from the top of the culture flask were then removed to another culture flask and placed again at  <dig> rpm. after repeating this process for five passages, the majority of cells in the shaker culture appeared to be single suspended cells and cell morphology did not appear to change during adaptation to the shaker culture system. passage of cells by diluting 1: <dig> in fresh medium every  <dig> days appeared to be optimum for maintaining shaker cultures of ao <dig> cells .

cell growth in adherent and suspension cultures
growth rates for attached ao <dig> cells grown in t-flasks were determined by one-step growth curves. for these studies ao <dig> cells were propagated in either tnmfh or sf-900iii culture media and for comparisons, high five and sf <dig> cells were propagated in tnmfh culture medium . during the first four days, sf <dig> and high five cells grew at a higher rate than that of ao <dig> cells. however, high five cells peaked at approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml at approximately  <dig>  days whereas ao <dig> and sf <dig> cell densities peaked slightly later, at  <dig> days, with densities of  <dig>  -  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. doubling times for sf <dig>  high five, ao <dig>  and ao <dig>  cells were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  hr, respectively. thus growth rates and doubling times were similar for ao <dig>  high five, and sf <dig> cells. in addition, growth curves of ao <dig> cells in serum-containing and serum-free media were similar to those of high five and sf <dig> cells in tnmfh. while the above data represent studies in adherent cultures, we also examined ao <dig> cell growth in suspension cultures . growth curves and cell viability assays in both one-step and continuous multi-step shaker cultures showed greater than 90% cell viability and cell densities up to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml.

cell volume comparisons
to compare the relative size of ao <dig> cells with that of the commonly used sf <dig> and high five cells, we measured packed cell volumes  of cells from each cell line  <cit> . pcv measurements suggest that the size of ao <dig> cells is  <dig>  and  <dig>  times that of sf <dig> and high five cells, respectively . thus, ao <dig> cells were substantially larger than sf <dig> cells yet appear to be slightly smaller than high five cells .

virus susceptibility
to examine the relative susceptibility of different cell lines to infection by acmnpv, we used a standard preparation of the βgal-acmnpv virus that was previously titred on sf <dig> cells , for infection of each cell line. in parallel, the titre of the standard virus preparation was determined on each candidate cell line. titration of the standard virus inoculum on sf <dig> cells produced a titer of  <dig>   ×  <dig> iu/ml. the titres determined on ao <dig> and reference high five cells were  <dig>   ×  <dig> and  <dig>   ×  <dig> iu/ml, respectively. these results indicated that ao <dig> cells were similar to, or slightly more susceptible to acmnpv infection than sf <dig> cells. in addition and as reported previously  <cit> , high five cells were approximately three times more susceptible to acmnpv infection than sf <dig> cells .

acmnpv replication in ao <dig> cells
to compare acmnpv production in ao <dig> cells to that in sf <dig> and high five cell lines, we infected cells with wt acmnpv and generated one-step viral growth curves in each cell line . peak virus titres were  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> iu/ml in high five, ao <dig>  and sf <dig> cell lines, respectively. although the kinetics of viral production were generally similar, acmnpv titres from sf <dig> cells appeared to peak earlier that in ao <dig> or high five cells. thus, ao <dig> cells generated virus titers at relatively high levels  that exceeded levels measured from high five cells, but below that from sf <dig> cells. we also examined ao <dig> cells that were propagated in, and infected in serum-containing tnmfh and in serum-free  media. cells propagated and infected in both media resulted in similar acmnpv yields. thus the presence of serum did not appear to substantially affect virus production.

recombinant protein production in ao <dig> cells
for maximal utility of new lepidopteran insect cell lines in biotechnology, the capacity for high-level protein production is an important characteristic. to determine whether ao <dig> cells were suitable for high-level protein production, ao <dig> cells propagated in both tnmfh and sf-900iii media were infected with recombinant acmnpv viruses that express either an intracellular, or a secreted reporter protein under the control of the acmnpv polyhedrin promoter. for these studies, ao <dig> cells were compared with sf <dig> and high five cells as standards for high-level protein production. the virus βgal-acmnpv was used for studies of intracellular protein production, and recombinant β-galactosidase expressed in the cell lines was quantified . β-galactosidase production peaked at day  <dig> for high five and sf <dig> cells, and at day  <dig> for ao <dig> cells. peak levels for high five cells were  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/ <dig> cells whereas those for ao <dig> were  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/ <dig> cells . thus, while β-galactosidase production peaked one day later in ao <dig> cells, expression levels were 152% of that observed for high five cells and 231% of that observed for sf <dig> cells.

to examine the production of a secreted protein in ao <dig> cells, cells were infected with seap-acmnpv  and levels of secreted alkaline phosphatase  were measured at various times post infection. seap production from infected sf <dig> and high five cells was examined in parallel. seap production in ao <dig> cells was measured at levels of >  <dig> u/ml . as also observed for β-galactosidase production, seap production from infected ao <dig> cells continued for a longer period of time and was 300% of that observed from sf <dig> cells and 150% of that from high five cells. thus, in both cases of intracellular and secreted proteins, recombinant protein production in ao <dig> cells peaked slightly later and was substantially higher than that from high five or sf <dig> cells.

analysis of seap n-glycans
to examine protein glycosylation in ao <dig> cells, we used lc-ms/ms to examine the n-linked carbohydrate from the  <dig> kda seap glycoprotein produced from the recombinant virus seap-acmnpv. using sds-page analysis of culture medium from seap-acmnpv infected ao <dig> cells, we identified an intensely staining band of approximately  <dig> kda . a similar band was absent from culture medium from wt acmnpv infected ao <dig> cells. the  <dig> kda band was excised and the tryptic peptide composition was examined by lc analysis and confirmed as seap. the seap protein has two n-glycosylation motifs  located at n <dig> and n <dig>  the two predicted motifs are located in the tryptic glycopeptides, fnqcn139ttr and yvwn266r. the observed masses of these glycopeptides are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the additional file  <dig> also shows the proposed structures of these n-glycans  and their predicted relative abundance. the mass spectrometry spectra showed the presence of an isoform at the n <dig> glycopeptide with a difference in mass of  <dig> da in the amino acid backbone. ms/ms spectra showed the additional  <dig> da on the alkylated cysteine residue  <dig> . we suspect that the difference reflects an additional methylene  group and is caused by residual acrylamide in sds gel labeling free cysteine to produce propinamide-cys rather than expected acetamide-cys or the presence of a mixture of cysteine and homo-cysteine in the tryptic peptide. in both n-glycans at n <dig>  the major sugar composition of the n-glycan was a fucosylated, mono- or bi-antennary, pauci- or oligo-mannose structure . the n-glycan at n <dig> had a molecular mass corresponding to a non-fucosylated pauci- or oligo-mannose structure . a small portion of the n-glycan corresponds to a bi-antennary tri-mannose structure with a glcnac at one branch . in sf <dig> cells infected with seap-acmnpv, pauci- or oligo-mannnocidic n-glycans with and without fucose were also produced in the major portion of n-glycan. in high five cells infected with seap-acmnpv, similar glycan components were also found by pngase f digestion followed by ce capillary analysis of released glycans  <cit> . but complex type n-glycans such as gal3glucnac3man3gucnac <dig>  gal3glucnac3man3gucnac2fuc, gal3glucnac4man3gucnac2fuc were reported as a substantial proportion  of the total n-glycans in high five cells  <cit> . seap produced from cho cells contains complex and sialylated n-glycan structures in >50% of the n-glycans  <cit> . a comparison of biochemical features of seaps expressed from three insect cell lines is summarized in table  <dig> 

a percent composition of the major component of n-glycans were determined by lc/ms/ms for each glycan  of ao38-expressed seap, and compared with published data from total glycans of seap expressed in sf <dig> and high five cells .

absence of tncl virus
recently, an alphanodavirus named tn <dig> cell line virus, or tncl virus, was described in high five cells . tncl virus was induced upon infection by wt and recombinant acmnpv  <cit> . in order to determine a) if that virus resulted from the initial cell cultures or isolation of bti-tn-5b1- <dig> cells, and b) whether ao <dig> or other ao cell lines also carried this virus, we used rt-pcr to examine acmnpv infected and uninfected cells from ao <dig>  sf <dig>  and high five. for analysis of high five cells, we used a relatively early passage of that cell line . rt-pcr was performed to detect tncl virus rnas in total rna isolated from wt acmnpv infected aop  and ao <dig> cells . five primer sets were used to sample the bipartite rna genome of tncl virus . the five primer sets produced amplicons with the expected sizes from acmnpv-infected high five cell rna, confirming the presence of the tncl virus. however, in a parallel analysis no amplicons were detected from cellular rna preparations from acmnpv-infected aop, ao <dig> or sf <dig> cells. as an internal control, acmnpv gp <dig> transcripts were examined in each rna preparation to confirm the quality and specificity of each preparation. one-step rt-pcr and pcr was performed with the rnas, either with or without dnase i treatment to confirm the detection of transcripts. when a dnase i-treated total rna preparation from acmnpv infected cells was used as template, the gp64-specific product was detected by one-step rt-pcr, but not by pcr alone, confirming the detection of the gp <dig> transcript .

discussion
in the current studies, we established a variety of proliferating cell lines from ascalapha odorata egg tissue. after generating primary cultures, proliferating cells were identified as individual colonies at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> days. cells from proliferating colonies were used for single cell cloning by limiting dilution at this relatively early stage  in order to preserve the diversity of potentially useful cells. the  <dig> rapidly growing cell lines exhibited variations in size, shape, substrate adherence and growth rates. in a preliminary screen, cloned cells were examined based on growth characteristics, acmnpv infectivity, and production of recombinant secreted alkaline phosphatase  from a baculovirus vector. from these, one cell line  was selected for more detailed analysis.

ao <dig> cells grown in tnmfh are moderately-to-tightly adherent, spindle shaped, and are relatively large in comparison with the more commonly used sf <dig> cells. measurements of packed cell volumes indicated that ao <dig> cells are larger than sf <dig> cells, but smaller than high five cells. ao <dig> cells have a morphology similar to that of high five cells . our subsequent analysis showed that ao <dig> cells had the following culture characteristics. ao <dig> cells can be plated at low densities  without substantial effects on growth rate, and cells grow rapidly  to relatively high densities of over  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml in stationary cultures. as cells grow beyond confluency, some vertical aggregation of cells was observed. the observed clumping may result from a lower level of contact inhibition than observed in other cell lines, and that may contribute to the observation of higher cell densities in adherent and suspension cultures and continued recombinant protein production. cell clumping was minimized by stepwise adaptation to suspension culture: removing cell aggregates at intervals.

perhaps the most important and widespread applications of insect cell lines involve the production of secreted proteins that will be later purified from the growth medium. therefore growth of cells and production of recombinant proteins in serum-free medium is an important characteristic. ao <dig> cells were adapted to a commercial serum-free medium, sf-900iii, within a relatively short time period  and without laborious or stepwise adaptation. however, the sf-900iii-adapted cells did not grow successfully in three other commercial media that have been used for sf <dig> and/or high five cells. ao <dig> cells also adapted readily to shaker cultures, using  <dig> steps to remove aggregates of cells during the first  <dig> days of growth in the suspension cultures. the procedures for adaptation to suspension cultures were similar to those we have previously used for high five cells. cell growth curves in suspension cultures and cell viability assays indicated that ao <dig> cells grew optimally in shaker cultures at cell densities ranging from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per ml.

we also examined ao <dig> cells in terms of viral infectivity, yields, and production of recombinant proteins. comparisons with sf <dig> and high five cells revealed that ao <dig> cells were similar to sf <dig> cells in susceptibility to wt acmnpv infection and both were less susceptible than high five cells. in contrast to viral susceptibility studies, we found that yields of infectious virus were highest in sf <dig> cells. wt acmnpv yields from ao <dig> cells were slightly less than observed from sf <dig> cells, but higher than virus yields from high five cells. thus, in comparisons of viral susceptibility and virus yield in sf <dig> and high five cells, ao <dig> cells compare favorably and are intermediate between these two well-established cell lines. the kinetics of β-galactosidase and seap protein production also suggest that progression of the infection cycle is similar in the three cell lines although future studies will examine this in more detail. more importantly though, recombinant protein yields from acmnpv-infected ao <dig> cells were higher those from sf <dig> and high five cells. while the kinetics of β-galactosidase production were generally similar among the three cell lines, peak protein levels were substantially higher from ao <dig> cells. although β-galactosidase production in high five and sf <dig> cells appeared to decrease after  <dig> days, we found that β-galactosidase continued to accumulate through  <dig> days post infection in ao <dig> cells. a decrease in intracellular β-galactosidase activity in sf <dig> and high five cells after  <dig> or  <dig> days p.i. has been previously reported  <cit> . production of peak levels of the secreted protein, seap, was most rapid in high five cells. however, peak seap levels in ao <dig> cells were approximately 50% greater than peak seap levels in high five cells . this may be explained by the observation that seap production in ao <dig> cells appears to continue over a longer time period, permitting accumulation of higher quantities of the secreted protein. it was previously reported  <cit>  that on a culture volume basis, high five cells produced at least fivefold more seap than sf <dig> cells. the maximum concentration of seap reported for high five cells was  <dig>  u/ml. these results are comparable to seap data from the current study . we measured peak seap production in high five cells at  <dig>  u/ml whereas peak seap production in ao <dig> cells was measured at  <dig>  u/ml in serum-containing medium, and  <dig>  u/ml in serum-free medium. overall our analysis of protein production using two reporter proteins expressed from recombinant baculoviruses indicates that ao <dig> cells are capable of producing higher levels of both intracellular and secreted proteins. the reason for higher level protein production by ao <dig> cells is unclear although it may result from either more robust protein synthetic machinery, more efficient protein transport and processing, or some combination of these factors. alternatively, our preliminary observations suggest that when compared with sf <dig> and high five cells, ao <dig> cells appear to remain viable for a longer period after infection initiates, possibly resulting in a prolonged period for protein production. future studies will address these and additional questions.

insect cells are known to produce glycoproteins with paucimannnosidic or oligomannose n-glycan structures and this is believed to be due to either divergence of n-glycan processing pathways in subcellular organelles, and/or different regulation of the enzymes responsible for generating complex n-glycan structures  <cit> . to examine and evaluate protein glycosylation in ao <dig> cells, we performed lc-ms/ms analysis on the n-glycan of recombinant seap protein produced from an acmnpv expression vector. based on the consensus sequence for n-linked glycosylation, seap has three potential n-glycosylation sites at n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  and prior studies suggested that only the n <dig> site was utilized for glycosylation  <cit> . in the current study of ao <dig> cells, we applied the precursor ion scans monitoring the specific marker ion  in lc-ms/ms analysis for selective identification of all glycan isoforms associated with each of peptides. we identified n-linked glycosylation of two tryptic peptides at position n <dig> and n <dig> which were eluted at  <dig>  min and  <dig> min, respectively under our lc conditions . this analysis is complementary with previous approaches for released glycans from seap protein, allowing us to determine the glycoisoforms and the difference for each of the n-glycan sites. sugar composition at both n-glycan sites was paucimannosidic or oligomannose, but more mannose residues were present in the n-glycan at n <dig>  interestingly, fucosylation at n-acetylglucosamine linked to asn selectively occurred for the n-glycan at n <dig>  it is possible that the selective fucosylation may have occurred due to the nature of the structure around n <dig>  the nature of the fucose linkage  in seap from ao <dig> cells is not known but insect cell lines have been reported to differ in whether or not their glycoproteins contain core alpha  fucose , and fucosylation may have significance in various applications. while recombinant glycoproteins with a core alpha  fucose may not be problematic as therapeutics  <cit> , they have resulted in false positives when used in diagnostic assays  <cit> . it will be of interest in future studies to determine whether this specific linkage is found in glycans from ao <dig> cells.

glycans at the n <dig> residue were predominantly man3f and man2f in composition . in contrast, man <dig> and man <dig> are the dominant glycan isoforms found at the n <dig> residue. nevertheless, the identification of the glycans in seap expressed in the ao <dig> cell line reported in this work is similar to that identified previously from sf <dig> and high five cell lines  <cit> . it should be noted that the relative quantitation of identified n-linked glycan isoforms should be treated as an estimate since the assumption that all sugar isoforms share a similar ionization efficiency may not be accurate.

recently an adventitious virus was identified in high five cell lines. the alphanodavirus, tncl virus, was identified during production of hepatitis e virus-like particles in high five cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus vector  <cit> . using rt-pcr and primers specific for five regions of the tncl virus genome, we were unable detect the tncl virus in acmnpv infected ao <dig> cells, an uncloned parental cell line  from ascalapha odorata, or sf <dig> cells  . however, tncl virus was detected in acmnpv-infected high five cells  used as a positive control. persistent viral infections have been observed occasionally in insect cell lines  <cit>  and nodaviruses are thought to occasionally infect wild marine invertebrates either latently or persistently  <cit> . a betanodavirus was also reported to be latently infecting a cell line derived from the brain tissue of the barramundi fish, lates calcarifer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the development and characterization of a new cell line, ao <dig>  derived from cells of the black witch moth, ascalapha odorata. ao <dig> cells were found to be highly productive for expression of recombinant protein and exceeded protein expression from the well-characterized sf <dig> and high five cell lines. the data described in this study indicate that ao <dig> cells will be a valuable new tool for protein expression using the baculovirus expression system, and in addition, ao <dig> cells may be important for cell line engineering by insertion of genes into the ao <dig> cell genome.
