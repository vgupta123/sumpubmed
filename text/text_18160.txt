BACKGROUND
human atp-binding cassette  transporters form a large family of structurally highly related membrane transport proteins. based on sequence similarities, the human abc transporter family is categorized into seven subfamilies, denoted abc a-g, and consists of  <dig> members. abc transporters translocate a wide range of substrates across cellular membranes, e.g. lipids, sugars, peptides, ions and xenobiotics such as anticancer drugs  <cit> . defective abc transporters cause monogenetic disorders and contribute to the development of complex diseases  <cit> . the physiological importance of abc proteins is highlighted by the fact that mutations in  <dig> human abc transporter genes have thus far been linked to a spectrum of unrelated hereditary diseases  <cit> .

beside protein coding genes for abc transporters, it has been shown that the human genome contains several abc transporter pseudogenes  <cit> . however, the exact number of abc transporter pseudogenes present in the human genome is still unclear. generally, pseudogenes are defined as non-functional sequences that are present in the genome with high similarity to one or more paralogous genes. this lack of function is a result of either failure of transcription or translation, or production of a protein that differs in function from the protein encoded by the functional gene  <cit> . pseudogenes are thought to arise either by gene duplication and subsequent degeneration of the duplicated gene or by retroposition of a reversely transcribed mrna of the paralogous gene into the genome. the latter are intronless and referred to as "processed" pseudogenes  <cit> .

during the past years, we and others provided evidence for the existence of abc transporter pseudogenes which are transcriptionally active  <cit> . for example, we recently demonstrated that the human ortholog of the rodent testis-specific abc transporter abca <dig>  a protein coding gene, is a pseudogene  which is transcribed into up to  <dig> alternative splice variants  <cit> . these results raise the intriguing possibility that abc transporter pseudogene transcripts may serve biological functions other than providing the genetic blueprints for protein biosynthesis.

in this study, we applied a comprehensive bioinformatic approach to identify all abc transporter pseudogenes in the human genome and systematically searched for evidence of transcribed pseudogenes. we identified a total of  <dig> pseudogenes within the abc transporter family with a significant subfraction  exhibiting transcriptional activity. we find evidence for transcription of the two previously known abcc <dig> pseudogenes abcc6p <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  respectively, and report their gene structures. moreover, we demonstrate, for the first time, a regulatory interdependency between abcc6p <dig>  and its translated counterpart, the pseudoxanthoma elasticum gene abcc <dig> 

RESULTS
the human genome contains  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes
to identify homologs of human abc transporters, we performed a genome-wide search based on the sequences of the known  <dig> human and the five murine abc transporter genes, for which no orthologous counterpart as yet have been documented in the human genome . the strategy relied on a blast homology search  in which the abc transporter nucleotide reference sequences were used as query sequences. these were compared with a version of the human genome  in which the known exons of the abc transporter query sequences were masked. our search algorithm resulted in  <dig> , <dig> primary hits. detailed sequence analyses revealed that a surprisingly large fraction  of the known human abc transporter cdnas contain repetitive elements . we then excluded all hits that were attributable to repetitive elements and assorted the remaining hits  according to their chromosomal position. neighbouring hits were merged to a single pseudogene candidate when they  displayed highest similarity to the same protein coding abc transporter gene,  were localized at a distance <  <dig>  mb apart from each other and  were oriented in the same 5'→ 3' order as the matching protein coding abc transporter nucleotide sequence. in those cases where a neighbouring hit was absent, a flanking  <dig>  mb genomic region was aligned with the respective abc transporter nucleotide sequence using the more rigorous alignment tool "matcher" from the emboss package. this approach warrants that more distantly related abc transporter pseudogenes are overlooked at a minimal rate. hits with > 70% identity across at least one complete exon of the respective abc transporter nucleotide sequence, were considered homologous and evaluated by the above criteria . merged hits were regarded as pseudogenes when they encompassed at least two homologous exons of the protein-coding gene and had defective reading frames which preclude translation into polypeptides that meet the minimum structural requirements for functional abc full-size or half-size transporters. using this strategy, we identified a total of  <dig> loci in the human genome that represent degenerated copies of protein coding abc transporter genes. they show > 70% similarity to the cdna of their protein coding counterparts across a range of  <dig> –  <dig> bp and contain the homologs of two up to  <dig> exons of the respective parental gene. the abc transporter pseudogenes we identified could be assigned to all seven subfamilies, abc a- abc g . we found that, within the genome, they are routinely present on chromosomes which also harbor protein coding abc genes  with the exception of chrs.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, from which protein coding abc transporter genes are absent . of note, half of the  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes are localized on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. intriguingly, the seven pseudogenes on the short arm of chr.  <dig>  are clustered within a segment of  <dig> mb in the order tel-abca17p – abcc6p <dig> – abcc6p <dig> – abca14p – abca15p <dig> – abca15p <dig> – abcd1p3-cer.

**accession numbers refer to identified est or mrna sequences representing transcribed pseudogenes

a total of  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes  were intronless, directly flanked by repetitive sequences , and most of them  also exhibited poly-tails. these structural features are diagnostic of processed pseudogenes  <cit>  strongly suggesting that they originated from retrotransposed transcripts of ancestral functional abc transporter genes .

a significant portion of human abc transporter pseudogenes are transcriptionally active
to assess which of the identified human abc transporter pseudogenes are transcribed, we analyzed all  <dig> pseudogenic abc transporter loci for homologies with est or mrna sequences using the ucsc genome browser. using this approach  <dig> est and/or mrna sequences were identified that exhibited best hits  with  <dig> of the  <dig> human abc transporter pseudogenes. these sequences displayed higher sequence identity to their corresponding pseudogene locus than to any other location in the human genome. this indicates that a significant portion  of the human abc transporter pseudogenes is transcriptionally active . among these, n =  <dig>  are processed pseudogenes. consistent with our in-silico results, rt-pcr expression analysis of all abc transporter pseudogene transcripts that span at least two exons demonstrated that the pseudogenes abca10p, abca15p <dig>  abca17p, abcc2p, abcc6p <dig>  abcc6p <dig> and abcg2p <dig> are in fact transcribed . interestingly, we identified alternatively spliced transcripts in three out of the  <dig> transcribed pseudogenes .

gene structures and expression profiling of abcc <dig> and its pseudogenes abcc6p <dig> and abcc6p <dig> in various human tissues
two pseudogenes, abcc6p <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  have been reported for the pseudoxanthoma elasticum gene abcc <dig>  a member of the abc c-subfamily  <cit> . they are located  <dig>  mb centromeric  and  <dig>  mb  telomeric, respectively, of the protein coding abcc <dig> gene . when we performed a detailed bioinformatic analysis of both pseudogenes, we retrieved a poly-containing  <dig>  kb mrna from the genbank ncbi database which had been isolated from human liver cells during the course of the mammalian gene collection program  <cit> . the transcript  exhibits perfect homology with the  <dig> putative exons of abcc6p <dig> indicating that this pseudogene is transcriptionally active. comparison of the genomic sequence and the  <dig>  kb transcript revealed that the abcc6p <dig> gene consists of  <dig> exons . the abcc6p <dig> intron sizes range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. exons 1– <dig> have perfect or near perfect identity  to the corresponding exons of the parental gene abcc <dig>  in contrast, the final exon  of abcc6p <dig> shows no homology to abcc <dig>  due to the observed sequence disparity in exon  <dig>  the transcripts of abcc6p <dig> and abcc <dig> can be reliably distinguished by rt-pcr. moreover, it allows selective targeting of the pseudogene transcript using rna interference strategies.

we also found in silico evidence for transcription of the second abcc <dig> pseudogene, abcc6p <dig>  consistent with this, our rt-pcr experiments using pooled mrna from  <dig> human tissues confirmed expression of this pseudogene . abcc6p <dig> is composed of four exons whose lengths vary between 59– <dig> bp which exhibit highest sequence similarity  with the corresponding exons of its parental gene. intron sizes of abcc6p <dig> range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. interestingly, genbank mrna database searches revealed a  <dig>  kb poly-tail transcript which displays perfect identity with abcc6p <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> plus additional  <dig> bp of the second intron . this transcript has been independently identified in the mammalian gene collection program  <cit>  from the kidney .

we next tested whether and to which degree regulatory interdependencies exist between abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  for this, we performed expression profiling of both genes in various human tissues by real-time pcr. expression levels were normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin. we observed a similar gene expression pattern for abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> with highest expression levels in liver and kidney . in most tissues abcc <dig> mrna levels were moderately higher  than those of abcc6p <dig>  however, abcc6p <dig> was the predominant transcript in bone marrow and fetal brain . similar results were obtained when the expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin b, another housekeeping gene .

the striking co-expression of the abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> raises the possibility that transcription of both genes is controlled by similar regulatory elements. when we compared the 5' regulatory region sequences of both genes, we found that they share an overall sequence similarity of  <dig> % within the first  <dig>  kb upstream of the start codon, the region that contains the putative core promoters . of note,  <dig> out of the  <dig> potential transcription factor binding sites, which we identified within the predicted abcc6p <dig> promoter region, are fully intact. in particular, an nf-κb consensus binding sequence , known to confer high-level abcc <dig> expression in hepg <dig> hepatoma cells  <cit> , is completely conserved in the putative abcc6p <dig> promoter region. three binding sites, a glucocorticoid response element , an octamer binding factor  and a gata- <dig> consensus site , respectively, show single base exchanges. in addition, a usf binding site  exhibits a nonamer-deletion which disrupts the respective consensus sequence. intriguingly, single base exchanges give rise to five novel transcription factor binding sites  in the predicted abcc6p <dig> promoter.

comparison of the abcc <dig> promoter sequence with the abcc6p <dig> 5' utr revealed an even higher degree of homology  than that observed for abcc6p <dig>  a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> transcription factor binding sites were fully conserved strongly suggesting that the abcc6p <dig> expression pattern is highly similar to that of abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  respectively. we were unable, however, to quantitate abcc6p <dig> expression levels by real-time pcr because the small size of the transcript and its exceedingly high sequence homology with abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> hampered specific detection of abcc6p <dig> mrna.

targeted knockdown of the pseudogene abcc6p <dig> results in downregulation of abcc <dig> mrna expression
the abcc6/abcc6p <dig> gene-pseudogene pair is unique in that  both components exhibit similar expression patterns,  share the extensive similarity of their  promoter regions and  are positioned in close spatial proximity on chr. 16p <dig>  the combination of these features raises the question as to whether regulatory interdependencies exists between abcc6p <dig> and its paralog abcc <dig>  to address this question we tested whether silencing of abcc6p <dig> has an effect on abcc <dig> expression. for this, a sirna-mediated gene knockdown approach targeting the non-homologous exon  <dig> of abcc6p <dig> was used which allows selective silencing of abcc6p <dig> but not abcc <dig>  among several exon <dig> specific sirnas, we selected the one by which the most efficient gene silencing could be obtained in hepg <dig> liver cells. knockdown effects were normalized to the housekeeping genes β-actin and cyclophilin b, respectively. using this approach, an average 69%  knockdown of the abcc6p <dig> pseudogene was achieved in six independent experiments . importantly, knockdown of abcc6p <dig> led to a significant reduction of abcc <dig> mrna expression. the residual expression of abcc <dig> was 84% , when normalized to β-actin, and 82%  relative to cyclophilin b, respectively . no significant changes in abcc <dig> or abcc6p <dig> expression levels were observed in hepg <dig> cells when unspecific sirna were used or lipid transfection agent alone were used . in contrast, gapdh-specific sirna  showed an 89%  knockdown relative to β-actin and cyclophilin b . similarity searches using the abcc6p <dig> sirna target sequence  as a bait consistently showed mismatches >  <dig> bp throughout the entire promoter region and all exons and introns of abcc <dig>  therefore, the sirna mediated suppression of abcc <dig> cannot be attributed to "co-targeting" of a common sequence motif in both genes. our finding that silencing of abcc6p <dig> has a suppressive effect on abcc <dig> thus suggest that the expression of abcc6p <dig> and its parental gene are interdependent.

discussion
in our study, we report the existence of  <dig> human abc transporter pseudogenes. the total number of pseudogenes in the human genome has been estimated to ~ <dig>  <cit> , whereas the predicted number of protein coding genes amounts to  <dig> –  <dig>  <cit> . this estimation indicates a genome-wide gene/pseudogene ratio of app. 1: <dig>  given the existence of  <dig> functional human abc transporters, the abc transporter genes/pseudogene ratio is app. 2: <dig>  thus, the number of abc transporter pseudogenes in the human genome is significantly lower than the expected average frequency of pseudogenes within currently identified gene-pseudogene families  <cit> .

our results indicate that the pseudogenes of the abc transporter family are distributed unevenly across the chromosomes. approximately one-half of the abc transporter pseudogenes  is dispersed across several chromosomes, whereas the other half is clustered on chr.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. of these, seven pseudogenes are located on the short arm of chr.  <dig> within a segment of  <dig> mb  and three processed  pseudogenes are clustered on the long arm of chr.  <dig>  the abc transporter pseudogene cluster on chr. 16p consists of three protein-coding abc transporter genes, six duplicated pseudogenes and one processed pseudogene. clustering of pseudogenes has been observed for other gene families in various vertebrates including the group of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes, α-globin, and the variable gene segments of the immunoglobulin heavy and light genes, respectively  <cit> . these gene clusters are usually composed of both protein coding genes and pseudogenes from the same gene family, which likely reflects the fact that pseudogenization is a mechanism that is highly associated with gene duplication events. the close spatial proximity of genes and pseudogenes suggests that the gene duplications are more recent evolutionary events because dispersion across the genome has not yet occurred. in light of this, it is reasonable to assume that the abc transporter pseudogenes located on chr.  <dig> and  <dig> are indeed the result of gene duplication and subsequent pseudogenization of the previously functional abc transporter genes. of note, the rodent genome contains protein-coding genes for abca <dig>  abca <dig>  <cit>  and abca <dig>  <cit> . it is thus conceivable that the human orthologs of these intact genes were functional for a certain time period after duplication before they ultimately became disabled. as for abcc6p <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  the other two duplicated pseudogenes on chr  <dig>  it remains unclear whether they arose by complete duplication of the parental abcc <dig> gene and thus may have temporarily maintained their function or whether only fragments of this gene were duplicated ab ovo.

unlike in the case of non-processed pseudogenes, the chromosomal distribution of processed pseudogenes generally appears to be random with the number of pseudogenes per chromosome being proportional to chromosomal length  <cit> . this is consistent with the view that processed pseudogenes originate from nondirected retrotransposition of preexisting transcripts. interestingly, the pseudogene cluster on chr.  <dig> contains three processed pseudogenes  which are localized in close proximity to each other . because it is unlikely that the abcb10p cluster is the result of three independent retrotransposition events targeting one and the same chromosomal segment, two of the three abcb <dig> pseudogenes most likely arose by gene duplication. the homology analyses, which we conducted, indeed suggest that abcb10p <dig> may have originated from abcb <dig> by a retrotransposition process. intriguingly, they also strongly support the view that abcb10p <dig> arose by duplication of abcb10p <dig> and abcb10p <dig> is the result of the duplication of abcb10p <dig> . because abcb10p <dig> and abcb10p <dig> most likely arose by duplication of an already disabled processed pseudogene, it is reasonable to assume that these pseudogenes never had the capacity to encode proteins. to our knowledge, the abcb10p cluster thus represents the first example of the multiplication of a processed pseudogene in the human genome.

importantly, we obtained bioinformatic evidence indicating that app. one-half  of the human abc transporter pseudogenes are transcriptionally active. consistent with this, our rt-pcr based survey demonstrated that at least  <dig> out of the predicted transcriptionally active pseudogenes were in fact transcribed. little attention has so far been paid to the phenomenon of pseudogene transcription  <cit>  owing to the fact that pseudogenes are generally thought to be functionless genomic relics. however, this view is challenged by some recent studies. for example, a comprehensive study focussing on transcription of processed pseudogenes in the human genome revealed that a subfraction of app. 5% of all processed pseudogenes identified are transcribed  <cit> . moreover, analysis of pseudogene transcription on human chr.  <dig> using a combined bioinformatic/microarray approach demonstrated that up to 20% of the pseudogenes identified on this chromosome are transcriptionally active  <cit> . the surprisingly high proportion of potentially transcribed pseudogenes questions the traditional view of pseudogenes and raises the intriguing possibility that transcribed pseudogenes may serve defined biological functions in the genome. the concept is supported by two recent studies which provide experimental evidence for pseudogene function. korneev et al. reported direct interference of a gene and its transcribed pseudogene by demonstrating that the antisense pseudogene anti-nos, whose transcript forms stable rna-rna complexes with the mrna of nnos, inhibits protein expression of its parental gene  <cit> . another study highlights the fact that pseudogene expression can exert a biological function that is unrelated to its ancestral gene as evidenced for the human xist noncoding rna gene, which initiates x chromosome inactivation and has evolved in eutherians by pseudogenization of the protein coding gene lnx <dig>  <cit> .

to test whether and to which degree regulatory interdependencies exist between transcribed abc transporter pseudogenes and their protein coding counterparts, we selected the pseudoxanthoma elasticum gene, abcc <dig>  and its transcribed pseudogene abcc6p <dig>  this gene-pseudogene pair appeared to be an ideal candidate for interference studies because abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> exhibit near perfect sequence homology in their transcripts but, at the same time, can still be discriminated by rt-pcr due to non-homology disparity in the final exon  of abcc6p <dig>  moreover, this sequence disparity allowed the selective targeting of the pseudogene transcript using an sirna approach. mrna expression profiling of abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> revealed that both genes are consistently co-expressed in a wide range of human tissues with predominant expression in adult liver, kidney and fetal liver . the tissue expression pattern we observed for abcc <dig> is in keeping with a recent genome-wide gene expression study involving  <dig> human tissues  <cit> . regrettably, this work does not include expression data on the pseudogene abcc6p <dig>  our finding that abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> share near-perfect identity in their respective core promoter regions together with the observed co-expression pattern strongly suggests that the expression of the gene-pseudogene pair is governed by the same transcription factor machinery.

intriguingly, we found that selective knockdown of abcc6p <dig> leads to a reduction of abcc <dig> mrna expression suggesting that the expression of abcc6p <dig> and its parental gene are interdependent. at this point, the regulatory mechanisms which underlie the observed gene-pseudogene interference remain speculative. it is well established that mrna stability and degradation significantly depends on specific cis-acting elements in mrna molecules. these cis-acting destabilizing elements, which can be found both in the utr and the coding regions of mrna are attacked by trans-acting machineries facilitating mrna decay  <cit> . transcripts from distinct genes which exhibit extensive sequence homology  and thus contain identical destabilizing cis-elements may compete for such trans-acting elements. it is thus conceivable that the abcc <dig> and the abcc6p <dig> transcripts due to their high sequence similarity and their topological proximity compete for the same cellular rna degradation route. as a consequence, lower abundance in abcc6p <dig> transcripts may thus lead to an increased abcc <dig> mrna degradation rate. it will be challenging to characterize in more detail the molecular interdependency between the abcc <dig> and abcc6p <dig> transcription units. knowledge of abcc6/abcc6p <dig> regulatory interaction may be of potential relevance to clinical medicine because abcc <dig> is the underlying gene defect in the syndrome pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we established the existence of  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes in the human genome. combined bioinformatic and experimental results indicate that a significant portion of these pseudogenes  are transcribed and we provide evidence, for the first time, for expression of alternatively spliced pseudogene rnas in the human genome. moreover, we show that abcc6p <dig>  one of the pseudogenes of the pseudoxanthoma elasticum gene abcc <dig>  is co-expressed with abcc <dig> in a variety of tissues and that knockdown of abcc6p <dig> expression impacts the expression of abcc <dig> strongly suggesting a regulatory interdependence between abcc6p <dig> and its ancestral gene. the emerging concept of pseudogene transcription and functionality has recently found its reflection in the redefinition of pseudogenes as "genomic sequences that arise from functional genes but that cannot encode the same type of functional product  as the original gene"  <cit> . accordingly, a subclassification into  'ghost' pseudogenes with some intermediate functionality, i.e. similar to a functional gene and transcribed and/or functional, and  'dead' pseudogenes that lack any functionality has recently been proposed. our results presented here strongly support this novel differentiated view on the biology of pseudogenes.
