BACKGROUND
the lower urinary tract is subject to a number of functional disorders in which a cross-communication between urothelium and detrusor muscle is a factor. bladder overactivity has been attributed to detrusor muscle dysfunction, and several in vitro and in vivo methodologies have been developed to better understand its pathophysiology  <cit> . although the detrusor muscle participates intensively in the inflammatory response, practically every major disease of the urinary bladder, including cancer, interstitial cystitis, and infection  <cit> , involves the urothelium  <cit> .

the urinary bladder develops as a result of indispensable epithelial-mesenchymal interactions responsible for directing urothelial differentiation and for normal smooth muscle development  <cit> . however, in adulthood, the urinary bladder is a highly heterogeneous organ, consisting of a large variety of cell types, and this complexity presents challenges to the study of physiological and cellular processes in health and disease. this was evident in studies determining gene regulation  <cit>  and target validation  <cit> . in the latter study, the expression of protease-activating receptors  was differentially distributed between bladder mucosa, detrusor smooth muscle, and nerve elements. moreover, during inflammation, par expression was up-regulated in the mucosa contrasting with its down-regulation in the detrusor muscle  <cit> . these results suggested a possible differential distribution of proteins between bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle and indicated the need for reduction of the whole tissue into specific layers.

the present work was undertaken to elucidate the transcriptional complexity of inflammation, as modeled in the mouse urinary bladder. the first step towards the study of individual layers was the separation of the mucosa and submucosa layers away from the detrusor smooth muscle and adventitia . we went further to determine low abundant transcripts, using suppression subtractive hybridization  and selected ones were confirmed by real time pcr. next, the ssh-originated transcripts were annotated and analyzed for significantly enriched transcriptional regulatory elements  using paint . paint utilizes transfac database  <cit>  containing eukaryotic cis-acting regulatory dna elements and trans-acting factors. the pattern search tool match in transfac suite is employed to identify the tres on cognate 5' upstream regulatory sequences  <cit> . putative regulatory networks were assembled using known interactions among genes and their coded proteins as well as information about tres that were significantly over-represented in the genes comprising inflammatory and control transcriptomes. together, these results constitute the first demonstration of the transcriptional complexity underlying the different layers of the urinary bladder and their contribution to the early phases of bladder inflammation.

RESULTS
ssh. from each library, at least  <dig> clones were further sequenced and annotated, for a total of  <dig> clones. the present work reports only tissue-specific transcripts  and treatment-specific transcripts .  <dig> transcripts were considered to be unique. these indicate that each of these  <dig> transcript occurred in a specific subtraction. transcripts that appeared in more than one subtraction were not considered unique and therefore, not included. selection of clones ceased when a substantial number of additional sequences  did not reveal any additional unique transcript. next,  <dig> clones were sequenced and analyzed for homology in the genbank and embl databases.

seventy six cdna fragments  were further annotated using the mouse genome information  <cit>  according to gene ontology and presented in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> fragments selected for futher annotation,  <dig> fragments had homology with expressed sequence tags  and cdna clones for which information about tissue specificity, biologycal or molecular function is not available. interestingly, one of these clones  was originally isolated from an adult male bladder cdna library  <cit> .

ssh-selected transcripts
target validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
from the annotated transcripts , twenty six were selected for further analysis by qrt-pcr. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  in tissues isolated from saline-treated mice the following transcripts were expressed preferentially in the detrusor muscle when compared to the mucosa layer: ctsh, eif4ebp <dig>  gstm <dig>  gsto <dig>  serpina3n, sprr2a, upk1a, and upk1b. with the exception of serpina3n, all detrusor-specific transcripts were also preferentially up regulated in the inflamed detrusor. in contrast, calm <dig>  cnn <dig>  and smoc <dig> were preferentially expressed in the bladder mucosa of control mice. with the exception of calm <dig>  all other mucosa-specific transcripts were up-regulated during inflammation. table  <dig> also segregates transcripts that were represented in both layers of control mice and that were up-regulated during the inflammatory process. the latter include: bcap <dig>  catenin, pls <dig>  mafb, prss <dig>  mpp <dig>  syn <dig>  lamp <dig>  and sepp <dig>

***female c57bl/6j mice were instilled with saline  or lps . twenty four hours after lps instillation, mice were euthanized, the bladder was removed and placed in rnalaterâ„¢  for separation of the mucosa and submucosa from the detrusor smooth muscle, as described in material and methods. four sample groups were obtained as follows: control mucosa , control detrusor , lps-treated mucosa , and lps-treated detrusor . the qrt-pcr amplifications were accomplished on an abiprism  <dig> using sybrgreen i dye assay chemistry

all samples were run in triplicate with the appropriate single qrt-pcr controls . from the qrt-pcr data, an average cycle threshold  value was calculated from the triplicate reactions. averaged ct values were then normalized  to the exongenous control gene, rca. the relative expression level of each transcript within each sample group  was determined by calculating the ratio of the antilog <dig> of the delta ct values.

discussion
we used a highly effective method for differential gene analysis, termed suppression subtractive hybridization , which has been developed for the generation of subtracted cdna libraries. it is based primarily on suppression pcr and combines normalization and subtraction in a single procedure  <cit> . the normalization step equalizes the abundance of cdnas within the target population and the subtraction step excludes the common sequences between the target and driver populations. in a model system, the ssh technique enriched for rare sequences over  <dig> -fold in one round of subtractive hybridization  <cit> . unlike microarrays, which mainly identify moderate to high abundant genes, ssh identifies clones that are expressed at very low levels. it is possible that some of the extremely low-level gene expression is not biologically significant, as it might arise from 'random transcription'  <cit> . therefore, we confirmed the differential expression of twenty six ssh-selected transcripts by qrt-pcr and the results were highly correlated. in addition, we introduced a redundancy factor by comparing the data generated from the analysis of multiple ssh libraries . nevertheles, the question of validation certainly is an important one, and it is one we have considered. for one, we examined properties of the candidate genes that were independent of expression, such as the presence of promoter sequences, to increase the probability that mechanisms suggested by the expression data were not simply statistical anomalies. moreover, the finding that mechanisms known to be operant emerged from the analysis also increases confidence that novel ones are valid as well.

this study was carried out at a single time point. the  <dig> hour time point was chosen because it coincides with the peak of acute inflammation  <cit> . this point characterizes the acute inflammatory responses to lps and in addition to edema and vasodilation, the peak response of neutrophil infiltration occurred at  <dig> h in the mucosa and submucosa as well as in the detrusor smooth muscle  <cit> . the rationale for a single time point was to keep the number of variables within a reasonable limit. we understand that  <dig> h time point may not identify preceding or proceeding events as we indicated previously  <cit> . therefore, the results of regulatory network here presented should be viewed as a snapshot of the inflammatory transcriptome at the point of maximal inflammatory response. nevertheless, genes identified as important at this time point can now be followed over time by other techniques.

by using cdna subtractions between mucosa and detrusor smooth muscle layers isolated from control and inflamed bladders, several clones identified transcripts that were further annotated. it has to be taken in consideration that the mucosal layer contains the urothelial layer and the lamina propria which involves other cell types  in addition to urothelial cells that may underlie the transcriptomes identified. in addition, during the inflammation, inflammatory cells are present in the detrusor as well as in the mucosa and may contribute to the inflammatory bladder transcriptome.

some of the transcripts are riken sequences and therefore, have no biological process attributed. interestingly, some of these transcripts with unknown function, such as ambladder, have been reported in the adult male urinary bladder by others using ssh  <cit> . however, the present work indicates that the same transcript was isolated from female urinary bladder as well.

central to elucidation of hypothetical cis-regulatory networks is the identification and classification of naturally occurring transcription factor-binding sites in subtracted libraries. the combination of ssh-derived transcripts with paint-guided query of the transfac database permitted the generation of regulatory networks containing upstream tres connecting corresponding tfs to the respective transcripts. interestingly, many of the genes identified by ssh are transcription factors which emphasize the use of ssh to identify low expression transcripts.

mucosa control , 
the regulatory network for the control bladder mucosa  was obtained in comparison to detrusor control and contained the following over-represented tres: ga-binding protein , yy <dig> , sf- <dig> , ef <dig>  cre-bp <dig>  and sp- <dig> .

gabp, also known as nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> , is a transcriptional coordinator of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase genes  <cit> . nrf- <dig> responds to increased neuronal activity by translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it engages in transcriptional activation of target genes  <cit> . gabp is abundant in the kidney  <cit> , however, the information about gabp is scanty in the rest lower urinary tract.

yy <dig> is a zinc finger tf which is thought to regulate cell growth and differentiation. yy <dig> normally antagonizes serum response factor   <cit> . interestingly, in the inflamed mucosa yy <dig> was not expressed and srf was considered over-represented . yy <dig> along with gapb drives the expression of myosin light chain phosphatase  which can be developmentally regulated in mammalian urinary bladders  <cit>  and it is involved in the bladder response to obstruction  <cit> .

sf- <dig> is a zinc finger motif of nuclear receptors  <cit>  essential for steroidogenesis as well as for the development of the reproductive axis  <cit> . cre-bp <dig>  which is an ubiquitous basic-leucine zipper, is required for normal skeletal development.

yy <dig>  sf- <dig>  and ef <dig> were found upstream of ambladder . prothymosin alpha is an oxidative stress-protecting gene  <cit>  and transgenic mice over-expressing this transcript develop polycystic kidney disease pkd  <cit> . another gene downstream of sf- <dig> was calponin  <dig> . cnn <dig> encodes for a multifunctional protein whose expression is tightly restricted to differentiated smooth muscle cell lineages during embryonic and post-natal life  <cit> .

sf- <dig> and cre-bp <dig> were found upstream of sac <dig> . finally, an additional tre, sp- <dig> was found upstream of sc <dig> which is a calcium binging protein and an extracellular matrix protein precursor.

epithelial-stromal interactions in bladder development have been extensively studied  <cit> . however, the present results depicted in the mc regulatory network raises the hypothesis that the bladder mucosa exhibits tres and genes whose proteins may regulate the smooth muscle phenotype .

detrusor control  
the regulatory network for the control detrusor smooth muscle suggests that pax- <dig> plays a central role. in addition to pax- <dig>  other tres such as: pitx <dig>  cdp, and c-myb were also found over-represented .

pax- <dig> was found upstream of the following transcripts: prion protein , cathepsin l , stromal cell derived factor receptor  <dig>   <cit> , thrombospondin, type i domain containing  <dig> , and uroplakin 1b . prnp seems to be involved in cell-to-cell interaction and its expression has been observed in germ cell differentiation during spermatogenesis  <cit> . ctsl is a lysosomal proteolytic enzyme and an imbalance between ctsl and its inhibitors is believed to correlate with bladder tumor progression  <cit> .

in addition to ctsl, the detrusor also presents ctsh under the control of c-myb. interestingly, thsd is involved in bladder cancer development  <cit>  and is a target for methylation  <cit> . in addition, thsd has been described as inhibitor of angiogenesis. finally, upk1b gene is highly expressed in normal human urothelium and its mrna was undetectable or markedly reduced in bladder carcinoma  <cit> .

interestingly, the control detrusor normally expresses genes in the pax- <dig> pathway that maintain neural progenitor cells  <cit>  and myoblasts  <cit>  undifferentiated. therefore, our data suggests that pax-3-regulated suppression of neural development in control detrusor changed substantially during inflammation and genes involved in neuronal development such as syn were found to be up-regulated. the later implies that detrusor instability may be a consequence of alterations in pax- <dig> pathway leading to increased maturation of neural progenitor cells within the bladder smooth muscle.

mucosa inflamed versus control . 
of all regulatory networks , mic was the only one presenting nf-Îºb , . these results confirmed our previous observation that it is the bladder mucosa and in particular, the urothelium, that responds to lps with nf-Îºb translocation  <cit> . this independent identification of nf-Îºb  <cit> , which is known to play a key role in bladder inflammation  <cit>  strengthens confidence in the identification of novel pathways.

three transcripts were found downstream of nf-Îºb: catenin , cox7b, and pis <dig> . regarding catenin, others have described its presence in the bladder mucosa and in particular in the urothelium  <cit> . indeed, alpha1-catenin was reported to be reduced in bladder urothelial cells treated with anti-proliferative factor  <cit>  which make this transcript a possible target in cystitis. moreover, p120-catenin is frequently altered and/or lost in tumors of bladder  <cit> . finally, bladder cancers harboring a beta-catenin mutation may represent aggressive biological behavior with enhanced proliferating activity  <cit> . cox7b encodes cytochrome c oxidase, subunit viib which is the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. finally, pls <dig> was found by differential display to have increased expression in cisplatin-resistant human cancer cells  <cit> .

in addition to nf-Îºb, mic also had srf that along with several zinc finger tfs ; ik- <dig> ; and vmaf ), drive the activity of actg <dig>  actg <dig> is a highly conserved protein involved in various types of cell motility, and maintenance of the cytoskeleton.

the mic regulatory network also includes the following unique transcripts: smoc <dig> , amcq , prss <dig> , and ifit <dig> . smoc <dig> is a widespread glycoprotein with a calcium-dependent conformation  <cit> . prss <dig> encodes a secreted trypsin  that regulates the availability of insulin-like growth factors  by cleaving igf-binding proteins and therefore, may function as a regulator of cell growth  <cit> . htra is involved in stress response pathways  <cit> . interestingly, down-regulation of prss <dig> expression may be an indicator of melanoma progression  <cit> .

ifit <dig> was originally cloned from a cdna library prepared from the murine cell line, raw  <dig> , after bacterial lps stimulation  <cit> . although it is a transcript induced by ifn  <cit> , its function is still unknown.

grp <dig> encodes a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is part of the protein folding machinery  <cit> . it is likely that grp <dig> is involved in the oncogenic transformation <cit>  since expression analysis revealed an up-regulation of grp <dig> in breast, uterus, lung, and stomach tumors  <cit> .

together these results confirmed that the bladder mucosa expresses unique transcripts involved in cell growth, motility, and cytoskeleton, protein folding, and proteases. some of these transcripts have been described to be altered in cystitis as well as in lps-induced bladder inflammation. however, the most striking result was that of  <dig> different networks, the mic library was the only one to have over-representation of nf-Îºb.

mucosa inflamed versus detrusor inflamed , 
the question being answered by this experiment was whether or not the bladder mucosa sets the stage for lps-induced inflammatory responses by up-regulating a unique set of genes and tfs distinct from the detrusor muscle.

in terms of tfs, the upstream stimulatory factor  was the most significantly over-represented  and driving unique transcripts . usf dimerizes to regulate transcription through e-box motifs in target genes. although widely expressed, they can mediate tissue-specific transcripts. usf is stimulated by glucose in murine mesangial cells, binds to tgf-Î² <dig> promoter, contributes to tgf-Î² <dig> expression, and may play a role in diabetes-related gene regulation in the kidney  <cit> . others have shown that usf binding activity is enhanced in response to lps  <cit> .

another interesting tf was the liver x-activated receptors  found upstream of several transcripts bearing usf sequence. lxr is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily  <cit>  is a negative regulator of macrophage inflammatory gene expression  <cit> , and a putative therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation  <cit> , diabetes  <cit> , and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

lim-only proteins , which consist of lmo <dig>  lmo <dig>  lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig>  are involved in cell fate determination and differentiation during embryonic development  <cit> . lmo <dig> was originally identified through its involvement in t-cell leukemia and subsequently shown to be critical for normal hematopoietic and endothelial development  <cit> . accumulating evidence suggests that lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> act as oncogenic proteins in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas lmo <dig> has recently been implicated in the genesis of breast cancer <cit> .

maz , also known as serum amyloid a-activating transcription factor- <dig> , plays a major role in regulating transcription of several inflammation-responsive genes, including matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> , the mouse mast cell protease - <dig>  <cit> , and function as growth suppressor in fibroblasts  <cit> . saf- <dig> transgenic mice are prone to develop a severe form of inflammation-induced arthritis  <cit> . maz is upstream of aplp <dig> which is a key regulator of structure and function of developing neuromuscular synapses  <cit> .

in terms of unique transcripts isolated from the midi library, our results indicate that transcripts such as zfp <dig>  and sir <dig> are downstream of series of tfs including: usf, lxr, deaf <dig>  maz, and lmo <dig> complex . sir <dig> gene encodes a member of the sirtuin family of proteins which are nad-dependent histone/protein deacetylases  <cit> . zfp <dig> is a member of the rab family of small g proteins, and regulates intracellular vesicle traffic to late endosomes  <cit> . another unique transcript was the androgen-regulated tmprss <dig> protease  <cit>  known to be expressed in urogenital tissues  <cit> . tmprss <dig> has gained interest owing to its highly localized expression in the prostate and its over-expression in neoplastic prostate epithelium. once activated, the serine protease domain of tmprss <dig> is released from the cell surface into the extracellular space and activates par - <dig> that has a role in prostate cancer and tumor metastasis  <cit> . among the proteins correlating with cytoskeleton dynamics, our ssh identified a transcript  encoding a 67-kda wd <dig> repeat protein  <dig> which is the vertebrate homologue of actin-interacting protein  <dig>  <cit> . wdr <dig> is involved in actin dynamics and seems to be required to induce cell morphologic changes, especially mitotic cell rounding  <cit> . others have shown that wdr <dig> was found upregulated in the lung  <cit>  and cell lines  <cit>  following exposure to nickel oxide-induced carinogenesis. finally, midi library also contained a riken cdna 2310015n <dig> gene that was described to be isolated from developing mouse libraries but no function yet has been attributed  <cit> .

interestingly, a comparison between midi and dimi libraries indicates that both share lxr as a tre. the major difference between these two libraries was found downstream lxr activation. in the inflamed mucosa, lxr preferentially activates zfp <dig> and tmprrs <dig> whereas in the inflamed detrusor lxr was found as a co-modulator of actg <dig> 

in conclusion, the mucosa regulatory network presents usf in a central position raising the hypothesis that usf-target promoters such as the tgf-Î² <dig> promoter are involved in the mucosal response to inflammation and whether mucosa inflammation follows similar diabetes- related mucosal gene expression.

detrusor inflamed versus detrusor control , 
the regulatory network of the detrusor muscle, inflamed versus control, selected the following transcripts: syn <dig> , siva , and eif4ebp <dig> , .

syn <dig> is a member of the synapsin gene family which is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein of small synaptic vesicles.syn <dig> has been mapped to an evolutionarily conserved linkage group composed of: araf <dig>  syn <dig>  timp, and properdin located at human chromosome xp <dig>   <cit>  and mouse chromosome x  <cit> . of interest, araf <dig> is a proto-oncogene which is predominantly expressed in mouse urogenital tissues  <cit> . in contrast, siva has an important role in the apoptotic pathway induced by the cd <dig> antigen. others have described that siva is a direct transcriptional target for both tumor suppressors, p <dig> and e2f <dig>  <cit> . finally, the eukaryotic initiation factor eif4e and eif4e-binding proteins  control the initiation of protein synthesis and are part of a translational signaling pathway sensitive to insulin  <cit>  and rapamycin  <cit> . changes in the state of phosphorylation of eif4e and 4e-bps occur at an early stage of apoptosis  <cit> . interestingly, eif4e selectively enhances the translation of powerful angiogenic factors such as fgf- <dig> and vegf  <cit>  and therefore may have a role in oncogenesis  <cit>  as well as inflammation.

over represented tfs in dic regulatory network were nrsf , creb/cre-bp <dig>  e2f- <dig>  and evi- <dig> 

creb/cre-bp <dig>  also called transcription factor atf- <dig>  binds to the camp response element and its activity is enhanced after phosphorylation by stress-activated protein kinases such as c-jun n-terminal kinase and p <dig>  atf- <dig> plays a central role in tgfÎ² signaling by acting as a common nuclear target of both smad and tak <dig> pathways  <cit> .

nrf- <dig>  regulates expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and it was shown to be part of the response to lps in rats  <cit> .

foxp <dig> belongs to the forkhead gene family which comprises a diverse group of "winged-helix" tfs with important roles in development, metabolism, cancer and aging  <cit> . recently, several forkhead genes have been demonstrated to play critical roles in lymphocyte development and effector function  <cit> . foxp <dig> is a potential target for treatment of experimental chronic inflammatory renal disease  <cit>  and type i diabetes  <cit> . in addition, both foxp <dig> and nrsf seems to be downstream of wnt-frizzled signaling  <cit>  which was recently proposed to participate in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis  <cit> .

e2f, e2f- <dig>  and rb-e2f- <dig> belong to a family of tfs implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and their binding sites are present in the promoters of several growth-regulating genes. e2f family members are functionally regulated, in part, by complex formation with one or more members of the nuclear pocket protein family such as the retinoblastoma protein  and play a role in neuronal development  <cit>  by acting as negative regulator of cell proliferation. the interplay between rb and e2f is critical for proper cell cycle progression  <cit> . of interest, e2f- <dig> has a growth-promoting effect in bladder superficial tcc  <cit> .

atf- <dig>  is transcriptional repressor involved in survival and regeneration of sensory neurons  <cit>  that responds to insulin  <cit> . atf <dig> is also a novel stress-activated regulator of p <dig> protein stability/function providing the cell with a means of responding to a wide range of environmental insults  <cit> . in addition, atf <dig> represents a novel mechanism in which anti-inflammatory drugs exert their anti-invasive activity  <cit> .

the proposed role of nrsf/rest is that of a transcriptional silencer that restricts neuronal gene expression to the nervous system by silencing their expression in non-neural tissues  <cit> . interestingly, loss of nrst function in human prostate carcinoma cells is associated with neuroendocrine phenotype, tumor progression, and androgen independence  <cit> . others investigators indicated that nrst also modulates the cholinergic gene locus  <cit>  which may have some implication in detrusor instability. recently, it was proposed that activation of the rest/nrsf target genes overrides muscle differentiation pathways and converted myoblasts to a physiologically active neuronal phenotype  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether nrst promotes the same transformation in the inflamed detrusor muscle. the latter would explain the hyperactivity of detrusor muscle observed in over-active bladder disorders such as obstruction, incontinence, and inflammation.

in conclusion two major networks are proposed to be active in the detrusor inflamed when compared to control. one containing a neuron-specific phosphoprotein of small synaptic vesicles  and the other an important protein of apoptotic pathway . in both cases, analysis of the intense upstream promoter network leads us to the hypothesis that both genes represent a common downstream target of several pro-inflammatory stimuli.

detrusor inflamed versus mucosa inflamed , 
the question being answered by this experiment was whether or not the inflamed detrusor muscle expresses unique transcripts and tfs distinct from the bladder mucosa.

two major pathways could be constructed with the combination of ssh and paint results. the first involves key smooth muscle proteins, a myosin light chain encoded by my <dig> and gamma actin encoded by actg <dig>  gamma actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility, and maintenance of the cytoskeleton. in addition, a role for smooth muscle alpha actin in force generation by the urinary bladder has been suggested  <cit> . several tres upstream of actg  <dig> and my <dig> were over-represented in midi, including lxr which was described above, srf, coup, pax- <dig>  cp <dig>  and rfx <dig> 

a second pathway involved the transcripts elp <dig>  gus, and ddx <dig> and two tfs comp <dig> and irf. ddx <dig> is a putative rna helicase and a member of a highly conserved dead box subclass. rna helicases are highly conserved enzymes involved in transcription, splicing, and translation  <cit> . there are several examples of the involvement of rna helicases in differentiation of germ cells, particularly in spermatogenesis. upstream of ddx <dig>  paint selected a tf that cooperates with myogenic proteins  and interferon regulatory factor . transcription of irf is synergistically activated by products of inflammation such as ifnÎ³ and tnfÎ±  <cit> .

two other transcripts were found downstream of comp1: gus  and elp <dig>  gus is a sensitive indicator lps activation of macrophages. elp <dig> is one of the sub units of the elongator complex, an acetyltransferase important for normal histone acetylation involved in elongation of rna polymerase ii transcription.

by comparing the inflamed detrusor and mucosa , the fundamental difference observed was the up-regulation in the detrusor of genes and tfs related to smooth muscle function. it is fair to propose that this network could underlie detrusor instability during inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS
we here present a novel approach to understanding the bladder response to inflammation as a system. by using ssh, low abundance, differentially expressed transcripts could be detected that probably would have been lost in the background "noise" of a microarray study. that these genes were, in fact, key players was shown by the remarkable concordance in the transcriptional regulatory elements identified and by target validation with qrt-pcr. we suggest that the results identified key players governing the normal growth and differentiation of bladder mucosa and urothelium as well as the cross-communication of these layers during inflammation resulting from a number of pathologic processes.

as genes encoding dna-binding tfs are the largest class of genes involved in human oncogenesis, it was obvious that in several instances the vast amount of information was related to cancer, in general and to bladder carcinoma, in particular. interestingly, some of the tfs and their correlated downstream transcripts originally described to be involved in organogenesis were also activated during inflammation. the implications of these findings may represent one more link between inflammation and cancer.

the networks here described could well represent key targets for development of novel drugs for treatment of bladder diseases.
