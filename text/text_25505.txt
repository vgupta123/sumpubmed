BACKGROUND
since the advent of genomic sequencing, technology has constantly been improved, leading to an approximately 3000-fold reduction in price per nucleotide sequenced  <cit> . the traditional method of sequencing is based on synthesis of a strand complementary to the template dna with a reaction mix that contains dideoxy-nucleotides labelled with a fluorescent dye or a radioactive isotope  <cit> . despite great progress in sanger technology, alternatives were intensely sought to further decrease the sequencing costs and to approach the long-term goal of sequencing a genome for $ <dig>  <cit> . recently, a new technology applying the principle of "pyrosequencing"  <cit>  on a 'picotiterplate™'-based reaction chamber was launched  <cit> . "pyrosequencing" is a real-time "sequencing-by-synthesis" method promising similar accuracy like sanger dideoxy sequencing  <cit> . the name of the company offering the new technology,  <dig> life sciences corp., quickly became synonymous with the method which therefore meanwhile has been referred to as "454-sequencing"  <cit> . throughout this manuscript, we will refer to sequences obtained through the use of sanger dideoxy technology from either abi  <dig> and abi  <dig> sequencers as "abi-sanger sequences" and to those obtained by  <dig> pyrosequencing technology as" <dig> sequences".

for  <dig> sequencing, genomic dna is mechanically sheared into fragments of a few hundred bp and linked to microbeads in a 1: <dig> ratio. the microbeads are captured in droplets  of an emulsion, which serve as pcr microreactors for template amplification. the microbeads are then distributed into a fibre-optic slide  where the four dna nucleotides are added in turns. integration of a nucleotide into a dna strand in one of the wells is translated into a light signal by the firefly enzyme luciferase .

the intensity of the signal is proportional to the number of nucleotides, if any, that are integrated in one step  <cit> . utilising such a technological setup was shown to be highly effective for sequencing compact microbial genomes, which contain only very low amounts of repetitive dna  <cit> . however, it is not known how  <dig> sequencing technology would perform on template derived from a large and highly repetitive genome such as that of barley.

eukaryotic genome sizes vary enormously from  <dig> million base pairs  in yeast to more than  <dig>  mbp in the lily fritillaria assyriaca  <cit> . these differences are mostly attributable to repetitive dna . for example, the barley genome  is almost twice the size of the human genome and contains more than 80% repetitive dna  <cit> . to make large genomes accessible for sequencing, dna is usually stored as bacterial artificial chromosomes  of 100– <dig> kb size.

abi-sanger and  <dig> sequencing protocols share few common steps but differ in many ways  and a thorough comparison of the principles of the two sequencing procedures has been provided before  <cit> . in short: common to both technologies is mechanical shearing of the target dna  into fragments of 2– <dig> kb for abi-sanger and a few hundred bp for  <dig> sequencing. abi-sanger sequencing requires sub-cloning the sheared dna fragments into e. coli cells . individual clones have to be picked and grown in liquid media for propagation of plasmid dna. subsequent plasmid dna extraction provides the templates for the sequencing reaction. modern abi-sanger sequencers produce reads of about 800– <dig>  high-quality bases while  <dig> sequencing reads, thus far, only reach 100– <dig> bp. the time required for shotgun sequencing is directly proportional to the size of the dna to be sequenced. for example, a bac clone with a size of  <dig> kb requires about  <dig> shotgun clones which are sequenced from both ends to be sufficiently covered .

 <dig> sequencing can use fragmented bac dna directly, thus, making the production of cloned shotgun libraries unnecessary. independent of the technology used, raw sequences are assembled into sequence contigs which, in the finishing phase, are connected properly to the final sequence. in a highly repetitive genome such as the one from barley, the finishing phase is usually the most time consuming of the entire sequencing process.

the performance of  <dig> sequencing has been tested in compact microbial genomes and higher plant plastomes, which contain only very limited amounts of repetitive dna  <cit> . sequencing of preserved fragments of mammoth genomic dna is, the only application of  <dig> sequencing to a larger eukaryotic genome  <cit> . problems with repetitive sequences were described to a limited degree  <cit>  but so far no study focused specifically on the technological challenges of using  <dig> sequencing in large and highly repetitive  genomes.

the present study addresses the question of whether  <dig> sequencing could be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional abi-sanger sequencing in repetitive genomes. we re-sequenced two previously published barley bacs to compare results from the two technologies. additionally, we sequenced two new bacs to have unbiased information on what specific problems might arise if one uses only  <dig> sequencing. we found  <dig> sequencing to be very suitable and efficient for covering the gene-containing portions at a high quality and we describe in detail the problems that occurred specific to sequencing dna from repetitive genomes. additionally, we developed analysis and annotation strategies to obtain very useable and partially finished working drafts for the bac clones sequenced.

RESULTS
using  <dig> sequencing technology, we sequenced four bac clones from barley to different levels of sequence coverage, ranging from  <dig>  to 66-fold . bac clones 773k <dig> and 519j <dig> were previously sequenced with the sanger method on abi  <dig> and abi  <dig> capillary sequencers, respectively  <cit> , and served as controls for coverage of gene space and repetitive sequences by  <dig> sequencing.

bac 519j <dig> contains only two genes and is otherwise comprised almost exclusively of repetitive dna. it contains several retrotransposons which are flanked by long terminal repeat  sequences of several hundred bp that add another level of repetitiveness. thus, bac 519j <dig> is one of the most repetitive barley bacs published so far. in contrast, bac 773k <dig> contains four genes and, although it is comprised of ~70% known repetitive elements, the bac itself contains only a few multicopy sequences. bacs 604d <dig> and 509d <dig> were sequenced for the first time to provide unbiased information on how well bacs can be sequenced and assembled using  <dig> sequencing. est hybridisation experiments had indicated that these two bacs are gene-rich.

for all four bacs, we did two independent  <dig> sequencing runs, referred to as experiment  <dig> and  <dig>  with experiment  <dig> resulting in about ten times more sequencing reads than experiment  <dig>  estimated sequence coverage ranges from  <dig> -fold  to 66-fold . for all experiments,  <dig> life sciences corp. provided sequence assemblies. assembled contigs as well as individual  <dig> reads were obtained in fasta format. additionally, ssf files  were available.

sequence reads from experiment  <dig> were assembled into  <dig> to  <dig> sequence contigs whereas experiment  <dig> resulted in  <dig> to  <dig> sequence contigs . the assembly data from all four bacs show that the number of sequence contigs decreases rapidly with increasing coverage and appears to reach a plateau between  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold coverage . these data indicate that coverage of bacs with  <dig> reads beyond 15-fold redundancy will not significantly decrease the final number of independent sequence contigs and singleton reads.

because experiment  <dig> produced a higher number of sequences, all of our subsequent analysis was done on this dataset, unless stated otherwise. the sequence assemblies contain 64– <dig> gaps and are, thus, far from finished bac sequences. in comparison, the initial assembly of  <dig>  abi-sanger sequences from bac 519j <dig> resulted in  <dig> sequence contigs . indeed, due to the massively longer reads, it is virtually impossible to obtain such high numbers of gaps with abi-sanger reads. for example, if a bac clone of  <dig> kb is covered with  <dig> abi-sanger reads of  <dig> bp each , one would expect  <dig> gaps if the  <dig> reads were totally regularly distributed. but in reality, many of these reads will actually overlap and result in a massively reduced number of gaps.

the  <dig> sequence contigs range in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and  <dig> – 80% of the total sequences were assembled into contigs longer than  <dig> bp. the majority of sequence contigs have sizes of less than  <dig> bp, but they contribute only  <dig> – 14% to the total bac sequences. additionally, the cumulative size of all sequence contigs did not reach the actual size of the bac clones for any of the assemblies  due to repetitive sequences being pooled into consensus contigs. as described below, these properties of the resulting sequence were not problematic in the context of cataloguing gene content in bacs but pose major problems if finished bac sequences are needed.

gene space and other single-copy sequences are covered at a high quality by  <dig> sequencing
to study sequence quality, we compared the contigs assembled from  <dig> reads  with the two previously published sequences of bacs 519j <dig> and 773k <dig>  three  <dig> contigs from bac 519j <dig> and eleven from bac 773k <dig> were compared with the published sequences . these  <dig> contigs have a cumulative size of  <dig>  bp and cover mainly single copy regions of the two bacs. over large stretches, the two technologies provided virtually identical results  confirming the generally comparable level of accuracy provided by either pyrosequencing or sanger dideoxy reads  <cit> . forty differences occurred in stretches  of a or t. in all  <dig> cases, the stretches were one nucleotide longer in the  <dig> sequence, which is in contrast to previous findings that showed a tendency of homopolymers to be interpreted too short  <cit> . a survey of all a/t homopolymers in the analysed region showed that longer a/t stretches are more likely to cause problems . an additional  <dig> differences were found one nucleotide away from a poly-a/t stretch whereas the other  <dig> had apparently random character. surprisingly, there were no differences in the length of g/c homopolymers, although these are known to be problematic for abi-sanger sequencing. assuming the same error rates for the two newly sequenced bacs 509d <dig> and 604d <dig>  one can expect about  <dig> and  <dig> sequencing errors caused by a and t homopolymers, respectively, per  <dig> kb bac.

mapping of the  <dig> sequence contigs to the previously published bac sequences also showed that gaps between sequence contigs are often only a few bp in size. in some cases, the gaps had size zero because two non-overlapping contigs mapped immediately adjacent to each other. blast search of the gap-containing regions showed that many gaps were actually covered by multiple  <dig> sequences. for four gaps with sizes  <dig> or  <dig>  we could show that they were caused by poly a/t stretches of 9– <dig> bp. all  <dig> sequences covering these gaps had low quality values in the a/t homopolymer, which is probably the reason why the motif was not accepted for the assembly. this indicates that some gaps may merely be a consequence of the stringency of the assembly method rather than truly missed sequences.

apparently, stretches  of a and t pose the main problem in low copy regions. these findings are similar to those previously reported for  <dig> sequencing of plastid genomes  <cit> . if one excludes differences in a/t homopolymers and those found immediately next to such motifs, then the two technologies differ in only  <dig> positions which equals slightly more than  <dig> difference every  <dig>  bp. we consider this to be an excellent match between the results of  <dig> sequencing and abi-sanger technologies. however, assuming that a/t homopolymers are the most abundant repeat sequence motifs in most genomes, efforts should be undertaken to improve the accuracy for these in  <dig> sequencing. it is perceivable that adjustments in the interpretation of signal intensity could significantly improve the sequence quality of homopolymers.

repetitive dna is more problematic for  <dig> sequencing than for abi-sanger sequencing
repeats such as ltrs or entire multicopy transposons were very poorly covered by the assembled sequence contigs of all four bacs because sequences from different copies of repeats were pooled and assembled into "consensus contigs" . in principle,  <dig> sequencing has the same problem as abi-sanger sequencing but due to the shorter read lengths, sequence pooling already occurs with motifs that are only little longer than  <dig> bp. if sequence pooling occurs only in highly repetitive dna such as transposable elements, assembly of gene space can still easily be achieved at high quality. however, repetitive motifs in genic regions also can cause discontinuity in their assembly. for example, the short stretch between the two genes hveif4e and hvmll on bac519j <dig> contains three tandem repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively . with longer abi-sanger reads, this region is not problematic whereas in the assembly made from  <dig> sequences, the three repeat units were collapsed into one consensus contig, causing a gap in the otherwise completely assembled gene space .

any type of sequence at or below this size threshold of around  <dig> bp that occurs in multiple copies on a single bac is problematic for  <dig> sequencing, independent of the copy number of the dna elements in the whole genome context. a low-copy sequence that is duplicated locally might be an obstacle that would be hard to overcome whereas a transposable element that has  <dig>  copies in the whole genome might not pose any problem if only a single copy would be present on the bac clone of interest. thus, sequence pooling might be a problem if genic regions containing repetitive motifs are targeted . consequently, the determining factor for whether a sequence is covered well by  <dig> sequencing is its copy number on the sequenced bac. thus, even repetitive elements that are frequently found in or near genes  do not cause problems in the assembly as long as they are present in only one copy on the bac.

coverage with  <dig> sequences is more even than with abi-sanger sequences
to study coverage of bacs with  <dig> sequences and abi-sanger sequences, we used all individual raw sequences of bacs 519j <dig> and 773k <dig> in blastn searches against their published sequences to determine which part of the bac clone was covered by each individual sequence. the total of that dataset allowed a visual representation of the overall coverage of the two bac clones . for comparison, sequence coverage was simulated assuming a purely random distribution of the same number of sequences of the same average sizes . over most of the bac lengths, the coverage with  <dig> sequencing is very even, oscillating around an average value, and is virtually indistinguishable from the result of the simulation . except for a putative duplication , there is no obvious difference in coverage of genes and transposable elements in either of these two bacs.

for bac 519j <dig>  the original abi-sanger raw sequences were also available and could be used for comparison . coverage with abi-sanger sequences shows large fluctuations and leaves four gaps which are not covered at all . the simulation for abi-sanger sequencing shows a smaller variation and left a total of only  <dig> gaps during  <dig> repetitions of the simulation. the large fluctuations could be an effect of the cloning process which might discriminate against certain sequences. since  <dig> sequencing does not require in vivo propagation of sub-fragments, replicative or recombinational incompatibilities are minimized. interestingly, bac 519j <dig> shows a region with clearly higher coverage by  <dig> sequencing; this suggests the presence of a duplication that was not resolved in the original abi-sanger sequencing effort .

the coverage of bacs 519j <dig> and 773k <dig> with sequences from experiment  <dig> is very even, despite the fact that coverage was much lower for both bacs . for all four bacs, we specifically tested how well the gene space was covered by sequence contigs from experiment  <dig>  here, we defined gene space as the coding region plus  <dig>  kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream. for the two bacs with the lowest coverage  of  <dig>  and  <dig> ×, respectively, only 12% – 54% of the gene space was covered with  <dig> to  <dig> contigs. in contrast, on bac 604d <dig> , more than 99% of the gene space was covered by very closely spaced sequence contigs which left gaps of only a few bp. the bac  <dig> gene space was represented by 64%–93% at a coverage of  <dig> ×. at all coverage levels, all genes were at least partially covered and no genes were completely missed.

the availability of abi-sanger sequences for bac 519j <dig> allowed experiments with hybrid assemblies, which showed that the inclusion of only  <dig> abi-sanger sequences closed more than half of the gaps in the  <dig> contig assemblies . comparison with the published sequence showed that  <dig> sequence contigs were joined correctly by abi-sanger sequences in most cases. thus, a strategy which combines  <dig> sequencing with low-pass coverage of abi-sanger sequences may be helpful in scaffolding and gap closure when finished bac sequences are required. in a previous study, the reverse approach was described when adding the data of one or two  <dig> sequencing runs to a  <dig> -fold coverage by abi-sanger sequences was used as a strategy to increase quality and decrease costs in microbial genome sequencing projects  <cit> .

useful bac draft sequences can be assembled easily from  <dig> sequences
the two newly sequenced bacs 604d <dig> and 509d <dig> were found to contain  <dig> and  <dig> putative genes, respectively, and about 60% repetitive dna . all gene containing  regions were assembled in sequence contigs of > <dig> kb whereas most repeats were found in small contigs of only a few  <dig> bp. despite the numerous gaps, the linear order of several contigs could be inferred by combining repeat analysis, comparative genomics and use of low-quality  <dig> sequences, as follows.

the ends of multicopy transposable elements were often found at the outer edges of large sequence contigs, which allowed inference of contig order by identifying matching target site duplications . transposable elements are usually flanked by 2– <dig> bp target site duplications  which are generated during their integration into the genome. if the 5' and 3' ends of a single known transposable element are found on different sequence contigs and both are flanked by the same tsd, one can assume that the two ends belong to the same element. thus, in such instances the likely linear order of the sequence contigs can be inferred without precise knowledge of the size and sequence of the gap that separates them. for transposons that occurred only once on the bac, the linear order of  <dig> sequence contigs was deduced through alignment to reference transposon sequences . in bac 604d <dig>  six sequence contigs could be arranged through identification of target site duplications and alignment with reference transposon sequences  whereas in bac 509d <dig>  a cacta transposon was used to connect two large sequence contigs .

between grass species, the linear order of genes is often conserved, reflecting their descent from a common ancestor  <cit> . in the case of bac 604d <dig>  two large contigs containing three genes each showed perfect colinearity with the corresponding region of rice chromosome  <dig> and, thus, could be arranged in their likely linear order . in bac 509d <dig>  only two genes are colinear in rice and both were already placed on the same sequence contig.

additional clues as to the linear order of sequence contigs were obtained from  <dig> sequences which bridge some gaps but were not included in the assembly due to motifs with low sequence quality . a combination of the three approaches allowed the linear arrangement of  <dig> kb of sequence contigs for bac 604d <dig> whereas bac 509d <dig> could be arranged into two supercontigs of  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb, respectively .

CONCLUSIONS
the dataset presented here, although relatively small, has convinced us that  <dig> sequencing could provide an efficient alternative to abi-sanger sequencing even if sequences of a complex or repetitive genome are targeted. an important finding of this study is that for all four bacs,  <dig> sequencing technology provided an excellent coverage of all gene containing fractions already in the initial sequence assemblies. the four bacs contain a total of  <dig> putative genes and at least the coding sequences of all genes were covered completely by  <dig> sequence contigs. for most genes, up- and downstream sequences were also present on the same sequence contig. since genic sequences are usually the regions of the highest interest, the four bacs can be considered sufficiently covered.

as long as finished sequences are not imperative,  <dig> sequencing can provide advantages in cost and time over classical abi-sanger sequencing. in the present study  <dig> sequencing of  <dig> bacs covered by a single full  <dig> sequencing run  was approximately 2-fold less expensive than by abi-sanger sequencing the individual clones to 6-fold coverage . this direct comparison, however, is very much dependent on local personnel costs and capacity of the chosen sequencing facility/provider. the most profound cost factor in the comparison of both approaches is time:  <dig> mb of sequences are obtained in a single  <dig> sequencing run taking about  <dig> h  <cit> . depending on the availability of the setup this would provide 20-fold coverage and thus full gene content information of  <dig> bacs  in a single  <dig> run. on the contrary, to achieve 2-fold coverage by abi-sanger sequencing  of the same number of bacs would take  <dig> times longer if running a single  <dig> capillary abi3730xl device. costs for abi-sanger sequencing have decreased ~ <dig> -fold over the last  <dig> years  <cit> . although speculative, a similar development may be anticipated for pyrosequencing costs given a broader acceptance and use of high-throuput pyrosequencing, thus, inexpensive and rapid sequencing of large and complex genomes may soon enter a new era.

due to the difficulties described in the assembly of repetitive sequences, a whole-genome shotgun approach by  <dig> sequencing does not seem practical for multi-gigabase plant genomes. rather, a bac-by-bac approach, or perhaps small pools of bacs representing ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  mb contigs, may be the optimal formula for genomic sequencing in large and complex genomes. our data show that at  <dig> to 10-fold coverage, the gene content of sequenced bacs will be completely revealed – even at lower coverage all genes contained on the clones will be at least partially hit. thus, at a capacity of  <dig> mb sequence obtained during a single  <dig> sequencing run, a  <dig>  mb contig represented as pool of individual bacs could be sequenced to 10-fold coverage with a high probability of detecting all of the genic sequences. for purposes such as the acceleration of map-based cloning and development of markers for marker assisted selection, this level of sequence resolution, if available genome-wide, would be a tremendous leap forward. if the genes of barley are indeed generally concentrated into gene-rich "islands" as suggested before  <cit> , perhaps only about  <dig> to  <dig> contigs of an average size of  <dig> mbp would need to be sequenced as bac pools to collect most of the genic sequences of the barley genome. if so, then it should be possible within a  <dig> million dollar genome sequencing project, at today's costs, to apply  <dig> sequencing technology to a complete triticeae genome. considering current efforts to establish large bac contigs that are anchored to genetic maps and cover nearly all of the barley genic regions within the next several years, it appears that barley is well positioned to serve as a proof of concept organism for such a venture.

obtaining completely finished bac sequences from a repetitive bac clone using only  <dig> technology might by very problematic and time-consuming. it is perceivable that many gaps could be closed by designing primers at the ends of sequence contigs and using them for direct sequencing on the bac clone. however, the several dozens of gaps in the initial  <dig> sequence assemblies would require an equal number of primers. shotgun sequencing of bacs using abi-sanger sequencing has the advantage that information from forward and reverse reads of shotgun clones can help infer the linear order of sequence contigs.  <dig> sequencing so far, although under development  <cit> , cannot provide such information. for highly repetitive genomes, the finishing phase is time- and labour intensive. therefore, the choice of sequence strategy is crucial and our proposed combination of  <dig> with a small number of abi-sanger sequences seems promising.

in summary, we believe that our results describing a strategy combining detailed comparative genomics, refined repeat element analysis, the utilization of low-quality  <dig> sequences and taking advantage of low-pass abi-sanger sequences can lead to very useable working drafts of large and complex plant genomes in the near future.
