BACKGROUND
hybridization is widely used to generate varieties of angiosperms with agriculturally or horticulturally desirable traits. for this, and to optimize hybrid seed production, knowledge of plants’ flowering and other reproductive processes is highly important, and plants with inducible male sterility can be particularly valuable  <cit> . analyses of mutants with perturbations of anther development, cloning and functional analyses of the genes involved, and transcriptional studies of key regulatory networks have elucidated many aspects of pollen development . a key step is meiosis in the anther, which generates microspores that subsequently develop into mature pollen grains  <cit> .

hybridization has been particularly valuable for improving yields of the staple crop rice  <cit> . for example, hybrid rice lines provide 15–20% higher yields than the best semi-dwarf inbred varieties used in china and elsewhere  <cit> . currently, hybrid seeds are usually produced by the cumbersome three-line breeding system. this involves the use of cytoplasmic male sterile  lines for which limited numbers of appropriate maintenance and restoration lines are available  <cit> . however, photoperiod-sensitive and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile  lines have been recently developed, which allow simpler, cheaper, efficient, safe, two-line hybridization. no maintainer lines are required because pgms/tgms lines can serve as both sterile and maintainer lines under appropriate conditions, and negative effects due to sterile cytoplasm or use of cytoplasm from a single line are avoided  <cit> . moreover, almost all normal rice strains can restore the fertility of f <dig> hybrids generated using pgms/tgms lines. consequently, rice breeders can freely choose cross combinations that exhibit strong heterosis to breed super-hybrid rice varieties  <cit> . therefore, the two-line system based on pgms/tgms lines is increasingly used for hybrid seed production  <cit> .

numerous researchers have explored the genetic bases of pgms/tgms lines and mapped various genes associated with their male sterility on different chromosomes . some of these genes have also been cloned. an example is the pms <dig> gene encoding a  <dig> -base long noncoding rna  in the pgms line nk58s, described as a long-day–specific male-fertility–associated rna   <cit> . another is p/tms12- <dig>  which encodes a small  noncoding rna sequence  <cit> . it confers pgms and tgms in the japonica and indica rice lines nk58s and peiai 64s , respectively  <cit> . a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line carrying a mutation in the carbon starved anther  gene, a r2r <dig> myb transcription factor that regulates pollen development, has been subsequently created  <cit> . recently, thermosensitive genic male sterile  <dig>  was cloned in annongs- <dig>   <cit> . mutation of this gene causes the tgms trait through a loss of rnase zs <dig>  function  <cit> . rnase zs <dig> can process the mrnas of ubl <dig> , whose over-accumulation causes defective pollen production and male sterility  <cit> . however, the molecular regulation of the sterility transitions in these lines is not well understood.

we have previously shown that co <dig>  is a new type of tgms rice line. a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene  is cosuppressed in the line by over-expression of a ugp1-derived construct in an h <dig> background  <cit> . in the cited study we also showed that ugpase protein accumulated in tgms-co <dig> florets at low temperature, and that the sterility transitions of this line involve temperature-sensitive splicing. however, details of the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. therefore, in this work, we compared transcriptomic profiles of meiosis-stage inflorescences in tgms-co <dig> and wild-type  plants grown at high and low temperatures. the detected differences in expression profiles provide new insights into plants’ responses to temperature changes during reproductive growth and the regulatory networks underlying pollen development in general. in addition, the observed expression profiles of some genes indicated that they are involved in the male sterility transition in tgms-co <dig>  our results represent a source of reference data that should be useful when analyzing the molecular mechanisms underpinning sterility transitions in other pgms/tgms rice lines.

methods
plant materials and growth
two rice lines were used in this study: the transgenic line tgms-co <dig> and the wild-type japonica variety hejiang  <dig> .

for high temperature cultivation, tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> plants were germinated on may  <dig>  grown on may  <dig> and transplanted on june  <dig> in an experimental field at wuhan university institute of genetics . for low temperature cultivation, tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> plants were germinated on november  <dig>  grown on november  <dig> and transplanted on december  <dig> in a paddy field at lingshui , hainan province. this is a region of southern china that is suitable for growing rice in the winter. all experimental materials were transplanted in the fields with  <dig>  cm spacing between plants within rows and  <dig>  cm spacing between rows. meiosis-stage inflorescences of randomly selected plants grown at high and low temperatures were harvested in july and january, when the daily average temperature was  <dig> and 20°c, respectively, and the photoperiod was  <dig> -14 h and 12– <dig>  h, respectively.

rna isolation and microarray analysis
during the meiosis stage, when florets were 2–3 mm long  <cit> , inflorescences were harvested from both lines under both sets of conditions. total rna was isolated using an rnaiso plus kit  following the manufacturer’s recommendations. the transcriptomic profiles of the florets were then explored using standard affymetrix instruments, protocols and software . more specifically, the signal intensities for each probe set on the generated genechip microarrays were detected with a genechip® scanner  <dig>  the raw signals were then analyzed with genechip operating software, with quantile normalization using mas  <dig>  to standardize the distribution of probe intensities for each array in compared sets.

microarray data analysis
all transcriptomic data from samples of three biological replicates of both lines grown under both conditions were analyzed by principal component analysis  using the sbc analysis system  and hierarchical clustering  using multiexperiment viewer . differentially expressed gene  analysis was performed using the limma package  <cit>  with fold-change and probability criteria of ≥  <dig>  and <  <dig> , respectively. heatmaps were then constructed using genesis .

gene ontology  annotations of detected degs were downloaded from the us national center for biotechnology information , uniprot , and go . the elim fisher algorithm was used to iteratively remove genes mapped to significant go terms from more general  go terms and and thereby ensure that the former were not overshadowed by the latter  <cit> . gene ontology categories with p values <  <dig>  were selected.

quantitative rt-pcr  and semi-quantitative rt-pcr
total rna samples  from meiosis-stage florets were treated with dnase i  and used to synthesize cdna with oligo primers and a revertaid™ first strand cdna synthesis kit , following the manufacturer’s recommendations. the cdnas were then amplified by real-time quantitative pcr  using a biorad cfx <dig> real-time system and sybr green pcr master mix . expression levels of all detected sequences were normalized to those of the housekeeping genes β-actin, ubq <dig> and sdha. relative fold expression changes of genes, between lines and conditions, were calculated using the pfaffl method  <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed using a temperature program involving initial denaturation at 94°c for 2 min, followed by an appropriate numbers of cycles  of 94°c for 30 sec, 55°c for 30 sec and 72°c for 2 min, and then a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. takara ex taq™ polymerase was used in all semi-quantitative rt-pcr reactions. the amplified pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. the rt-pcr products were sequenced to ensure that they were derived from the targeted genes. primers used in the pcr experiments are listed in additional file  <dig> 

rna gel blot analysis
total rna was separated on a denaturing  <dig> % formaldehyde agarose gel. loading of equal amounts of rna was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining. the rna was transferred to a hybond n+ membrane . ugp <dig> orf was amplified as probe which was labeled with dctp using the prime-a-gene labeling system , and the membrane was hybridized for at least 10 h at 65°c with the labeled probes. the resulting blots were washed for 15 min at 65°c in 1 × ssc and  <dig> % sds followed by 15 min at 65°c in  <dig>  × ssc and  <dig> % sds. the membrane was then exposed to storage phosphor screens , and the hybridization signals were detected using a typhoon phosphorimager .

protein extraction and gel blot analysis
proteins were extracted from meiosis-stage florets, electrophoretically separated and electroblotted. they were then probed immunologically as previously described  <cit> , except that the secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit igg  conjugated to horseradish peroxidase . signals were subsequently quantified by chemiluminescentce using the wbkls <dig> immobilon western hrp substrate , biomax mr x-ray films  and a gs- <dig> scanner  operated in transmission mode following the manufacturers’ instructions.

gene co-expression network analysis
gene co-expression network analysis was performed to track interactions among the identified degs according to their normalized signal intensities in our microarrays. pearson correlation analysis was applied to each pair of genes and significantly correlated pairs  were used to construct the network  <cit> . in addition, to identify key regulatory genes in the networks, k core-scoring was performed to facilitate subsequent graph topology analysis  <cit> . the k core-score of a given gene indicates its hub or nodal status with respect to k other genes in a network  <cit> . the genes with the highest k core-scores and degrees of connection were thus identified as “key regulatory genes” in the generated network  <cit> .

RESULTS
phenotypes and osugp1expression in tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> lines
we previously found that high temperature induces male sterility in tgms-co <dig> by ugp <dig> cosuppression mediated by over-expression of a construct encoding aberrant ugp <dig> transcripts containing the ubi <dig> intron  <cit> . in the cited study we also found indications that this line’s fertility is restored at low temperature by rna splicing, which yields ugp <dig> transcripts, albeit at lower than wild-type levels  <cit> . accordingly, in the present study tgms-co <dig> was completely male sterile under natural summer conditions in wuhan but fertile in winter in lingshui . in contrast, the wild type line  was fertile under both conditions .figure  <dig>

western blotting indicated that fertility reversion at low temperature in tgms-co <dig> is due to accumulation of ugpase protein in florets . we designed pcr primers targeting the 3’ untranslational region and the open reading frame  of the ugp <dig> gene to detect endogenous ugp <dig> transcripts and total ugp <dig> transcripts , respectively. our qrt-pcr analysis indicated that transcription of the endogenous ugp <dig> was strongly suppressed in tgms-co <dig> florets under both growth conditions. in contrast, expression of total ugp <dig> mrna was higher at low temperature than at high temperature . we also designed pcr primers to detect the correctly spliced transgenic ugp <dig> transcripts by amplifying the sequence between the exon of the ubi <dig> promoter and the termination codon of ugp <dig> . more correctly spliced transgenic ugp <dig> transcripts were accumulated in tgms-co <dig> plants at low temperature than at high temperature. by combining the results of these genetic analyses, we were able to show that the slightly higher expression of total ugp <dig> mrna in tgms-co <dig> under low temperature conditions is caused by the correctly spliced transgenic ugp <dig> mrnas. these results are consistent with previous findings  <cit> . we also unexpectedly detected a slight increase in the expression of total ugp <dig> mrna in tgms-co <dig> under both conditions. this might be partly due to artefacts arising from partial reverse transcription of longer-than-full-length transcripts and rna degradation intermediates that were detectable by qrt-pcr but not by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. in accordance with previous studies, the abundance of correctly spliced ugp <dig> mrnas in tgms-co <dig> florets remained low under both growth conditions and these mrnas could not be detected by northern blot analysis   <cit> . these findings indicate that both temperature-sensitive splicing and translational regulation may be important for fertility reversion in tgms-co <dig> plants. to identify genes involved in the fertility reversion process, we used affymetrix microarray analysis to construct transcriptome profiles of florets of both lines grown under both conditions by affymetrix microarray analysis. meiosis-stage inflorescences were used for this because pollen mother cells  of tgms-co <dig> plants begin to degenerate at this stage  <cit> . samples from h <dig> plants grown at high temperature, tgms-co <dig> plants grown at high temperature, h <dig> plants grown at low temperature and tgms-co <dig> plants grown at low temperature were named h1493ht, co27ht, h1493lt and co27lt, respectively.

global analysis of the microarray data
our microarray experiments identified a total of  <dig>  probe sets expressed in at least one of the four sets of samples. for quality control, we compared expression files obtained for all of the samples by pca to ensure that samples representing plants of the same lines grown under the experimental conditions were similar . hierarchical clustering  of the data also indicated clear separation of samples representing different lines and different growth conditions . comparisons of the co27ht vs. h1493ht, co27lt vs. h1493lt, co27lt vs. co27ht and h1493lt vs. h1493ht datasets detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degs with a fold-change  ≥  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig> . these observations clearly indicate that the differences between the two growth conditions affected global gene expression more strongly than the genetic differences between the two lines in our four sets of samples. this is consistent with previous findings that temperature affects the expression of far more genes  than male sterility mechanisms mediated by a single dominant gene   <cit> .figure  <dig>

degs between tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> at high temperature
to elucidate the gene network regulating the temperature-inducible male-sterility of tgms-co <dig>  we first examined the  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> grown at high temperature . there was no significant difference between the numbers of up-and down-regulated genes in co27ht relative to h1493ht. the functions of the genes exhibiting differential expression between the two lines were investigated by assigning gene ontology  categories and enrichments to the up- and down-regulated degs . based on the assigned go terms, genes involved in developmental processes , cellular processes involved in reproduction, responses to stimuli , jasmonic acid -mediated metabolic processes and secondary metabolic process were enriched in the up-regulated genes. these findings indicate that the absence of normal anther development induces genetic buffering mechanisms via activation of development-, reproduction- and stress-related genes in the male sterile line. the involvement of ja-associated genes is consistent with expectations because in addition to responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, ja also plays pivotal roles in reproduction  <cit> . mutants with lesions in various ja biosynthetic enzymes have been shown to be male sterile and defective in pollen maturation and release  <cit> . in contrast, enrichment of genes involved in many other biological processes  was detected in the repressed sets of genes. these processes are mainly related to pollen development . ugpase is a key enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, playing crucial roles in cell wall biosynthesis and callose deposition in cell walls  <cit> . it also plays a major role in pollen formation and maturation  <cit> , as pmcs and meiotic tetrads are surrounded by callose before meiosis and the formation of the pollen grain wall, respectively  <cit> . our microarray, qpcr, northern blotting and western blotting analyses demonstrated that the expression of ugp <dig>  was much weaker in co27ht than in h1493ht. therefore, the expression of these pollen development-related genes may be influenced by low ugp <dig> expression levels. these findings indicate that the anther development regulation network is perturbed in tgms-co <dig> at high temperature.figure  <dig> 
go analysis of degs between h <dig> and tgms-co <dig> at high temperature. black and white bars indicate up- and down-regulated genes in co27ht, respectively.



degs between tgms-co <dig> grown under the two conditions
to further explore the molecular regulation of sterility transitions in tgms-co <dig>  we focused on degs between tgms-co <dig> plants grown at high and low temperatures . far more degs  were detected than in the co27ht vs. h1493ht comparison, so differences in growth conditions account for most of the significant transcriptomic differences detected. accordingly, numerous genes were differentially expressed in h <dig> under the two growth conditions , although there were no obvious phenotypic differences between them. we applied series-cluster analysis to the  <dig> probe sets that were differentially expressed in tgms-co <dig> at high and low temperatures to explore the expression dynamics of the corresponding genes in the four sample types. these probe-sets were classified into  <dig> clusters , but they were only significantly enriched in seven clusters. six of these clusters were very significantly separated from the others and could be divided into three pairs of antagonistic clusters . each of these six contained more than  <dig> probe-sets.figure  <dig> 
significant clusters  of genes differentially expressed between co27ht and co27lt. the four points on the abscissa represent the four sample types, from left to right: h1493ht, co27ht, co27lt and h1493lt. the digits in the top and lower left corners indicate cluster numbers and numbers of differentially expressed genes in the corresponding clusters, respectively. the sample names are the same as those in figure 1c.



clusters  <dig> and  <dig> include genes that were either most strongly or most weakly expressed in co27ht. the cluster  <dig> sub-set that was highly expressed in co27ht was enriched in genes associated with stress responses, like the pattern observed in co27ht relative to h1493ht samples, as discussed in the preceding section . more excitingly, some genes involved in mrna catabolic processes were significantly enriched in cluster  <dig> . cluster  <dig> and  <dig> were enriched in genes that were most strongly or weakly expressed in co27lt, and genes related to responses to various stresses and stimuli  . these findings indicate that expression of some stress-related genes in tgms-co <dig> was perturbed at low temperature as well as high temperature.

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> included the largest number of degs , corroborating the broad impact of growth conditions on gene expression. go assignations of cluster  <dig> indicated that it was enriched in many genes involved in low temperature response  . a considerable number of genes related to these stress responses were also found in cluster  <dig> . however, small numbers of photoperiod response-related genes were found in both clusters . this is consistent with a previous report that day length only regulated the expression of 100– <dig> genes in nk58s  <cit> . similarly, another study showed that a shift from high to low temperatures caused more pronounced changes in the protein expression patterns of peach trees than did a shift from long to short photoperiods  <cit> . these results indicated that temperature rather than day length was the main environmental factor affecting global gene expression in our sampled plants. as temperatures at both sites were suitable for rice growth, the detected differences in gene expression indicate that plants may fine-tune their expression profiles via adaptive responses to temperature changes that optimize their growth and reproduction processes. in accordance with this hypothesis, two rice cbf/dreb  genes, loc_os09g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> , were induced by low temperature. cbf/drebs are well known cold-responsive transcriptional activators, and their overexpression of cbf/drebf reportedly increases freezing tolerance in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . these results indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in plants’ chilling and cooling responses have common elements.

more significantly in the context of this study, cluster  <dig> was enriched in genes related to dna replication, repair and recombination; chromosome organization; and cell cycling , division and proliferation . this is consistent with the importance of meiosis in the sexual reproduction of rice for formation of haploid spores and gametes. it is also the most sensitive stage to various stimuli because most male fertility perturbations occur during meiosis  <cit> , including perturbations that occur in pmcs in tgms rice lines. for example, pa64s plants are reportedly completely male sterile when grown at high temperatures , but male fertile when exposed to lower temperatures  during the microspore mother cell  to meiosis stages  <cit> . the fertility of many other tgms rice lines is also temperature-sensitive between the stages of the pistil/stamen primordium-formation and meiosis  <cit> . furthermore, combinations of low temperature and long photoperiods or high temperature and short photoperiods may reduce male fertility in pgms rice plants. notably, the male fertility of nongken58s and w6154s  is thermosensitive from panicle primordium differentiation and from stamen/pistil primordium formation to the single nuclear pollen stage, respectively  <cit> . thus, although reported thermosensitive phases differ among pgms/tgms rice lines, they all include the most sensitive meiosis stage and temperature is a common regulator. the low temperature-induced genes in cluster  <dig> may help pmcs progress to meiosi, so this cluster appears to contain the genes with the greatest impact on pgms/tgms processe. this finding will hopefully support detailed investigations into the molecular mechanisms involved in sterility transitions in various other pgms/tgms rice lines.

tgms related-genes in tgms-co27
as already mentioned, tgms-co <dig> plants reverted to fertility and accumulated ugpase protein in their inflorescences at low temperature. while ugp <dig> remained cosuppressed in these plants, the levels of correctly spliced ugp <dig> mrnas that accumulated in them were far greater than those observed in co27ht plants, although lower than the wild-type levels. therefore, we hypothesized that the degs between co27lt and co27ht involved in post-transcriptional and translational process may have important functions in tgms. in accordance with this hypothesis, temperature- and/or photoperiod-sensitive post-transcriptional regulation of key transcripts has been detected in other pgms/tgms rice lines. for example, processing of ldmar  in nongken58s and a non-coding rna expressed from the corresponding locus in the indica line pa64s is involved in their pgms/tgms transitions  <cit> . in addition, rnase zs1-mediated ubl <dig> mrna regulation causes a tgms trait in tms <dig> rice mutants  <cit> . temperature- and photoperiod-sensitive translation is also important in various other organisms. for example, temperature-sensitive translational regulation of frequency  contributes to temperature sensing by the circadian clock of neurospora crassa
 <cit> , and light-sensitive translational regulation of doubletime contributes to circadian period modulation in drosophila
 <cit> .

as also mentioned,  <dig> probe-sets representing  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between co27lt and co27ht. according to the go terms in table  <dig>   <dig> probe-sets representing  <dig> of these degs may be directly involved in tgms-related post-transcriptional and translational processes . in addition, hierarchical clustering  of the expression profiles of these  <dig> probe-sets in the four sample types revealed that about two-thirds of them were up-regulated in co27lt relative to co27ht . however, most of these genes were not differentially expressed between tgms-co <dig> and h <dig> at either high or low temperature . we also matched these  <dig> genes to the  <dig> clusters we previously identified . eighty-six genes were significantly  included in cluster  <dig>  confirming that this is the most important cluster for fertility alteration in tgms rice lines. in contrast,  <dig> genes were included in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  which contained genes that were particularly weakly expressed in co27ht.table  <dig>

the up and down gene numbers indicate the numbers of genes that were expressed more strongly in tgms-co <dig> plants at low temperature than at high temperature and vice versa, respectively.



we constructed a gene co-expression network based on the normalized signal intensities of the  <dig> degs in our microarrays  to examine possible functional linkages among them  <cit> . the genes’ “k core-scores”  were used to identify “key regulatory” genes within this set, i.e. genes that have high networking degrees and appear to govern the interactions among the degs. fifty-eight genes were assigned k core-scores exceeding  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> of which were included in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. according to their go annotations,  <dig> and  <dig> genes included in cluster  <dig> have functions in post-transcriptional and translational processes, respectively, and one participates in both of these processes .figure  <dig> 
co-expression network of the  <dig> tgms-related differentially expressed genes. the color of each circle indicates the k core-scores of the corresponding genes, according to the key in the lower left corner, and its size indicates the k-core score of the genes.



post-transcriptional processes are very important in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and are associated with numerous plant responses to abiotic stresses  <cit> . one of the key processes is alternative splicing, which can increase protein diversity and affect mrna stability  <cit> . this occurs in the spliceosome, which contains abundant small nuclear rnas  and about  <dig> proteins, including various rna-binding proteins, rna-dependent atpases, rna helicases and protein kinases involved in splicing regulation .

two of the  <dig> “key regulatory” genes , which encode arg/ser-rich domain -containing zinc finger proteins , were down-regulated in co27lt compared with co27ht. expression of rszpz <dig> is also reportedly decreased in japonica and indica rice, while rszpz21a is up-regulated in japonica rice but down-regulated in indica rice, under cold stress  <cit> . our results show that rszpz <dig> was down-regulated in both rice lines at low temperature, but rszpz21a was down-regulated in co27lt. rszp21a, rszp21b and rszp <dig> are three human 9g8-type proteins that have a rna recognition motif  and a rs domain separated by a cchc-type zinc knuckle  <cit> . rszp <dig> has been shown not only to increase splicing efficiency but also to alter the selection of 5’ splice sites of the wxb intron and might affect other steps in rna processing and translation  <cit> . serine/arginine-rich  proteins play important roles in both the constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mrna  <cit> . we detected weak expression of these proteins  in co27lt.

in addition, a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein -encoding gene  was up-regulated in both rice lines at low temperature. ptbs are key splicing factors that influence splice site selection and orchestrate coordinated splicing programs during developmental processes. notably, two arabidopsis ptb-related genes  are reportedly involved in pollen germination  <cit> . therefore, stronger expression of the ptb gene is likely important for the correct splicing of exogenous ugp <dig> mrnas and restoring fertility in tgms-co <dig> plants at low temperature. as these genes involved in alternate splicing were temperature-regulated, transcripts of selected sr genes that are known to be alternatively spliced  <cit>  were analyzed to explore the influence of temperature on their splicing patterns . we found that low temperature had dramatic effects on the splicing pattern of sr <dig>  scl <dig> , scl <dig> and rsz <dig>  although scl30a did not show temperature-related differences in splicing patterns, its expression pattern was very similar to that of ugp <dig>  corroborating the conclusion that sr genes may be involved in temperature-sensitive alternative splicing of ugp <dig>  these results clearly indicate that low temperature affects the global splicing of mrnas.

two dead/deah box rna helicase-encoding genes, hen <dig>  and skiv2l <dig> , were also up-regulated in co27lt. athen <dig> is highly expressed in arabidopsis inflorescences, specifically in their meristems and developing flowers, where it is apparently required for maintenance of expression of mads-box genes, class b and c  <cit> . a homologue of the skiv2l genes in arabidopsis is mtr <dig>  which encodes a hen2-homologous protein required for proper rrna biogenesis  <cit> . plants lacking atmtr <dig> are viable but have several developmental defects, including aberrant vein patterning and pointed first leaves  <cit> . dexd/h box rna helicases have multiple functions in transcriptional processes that involve multi-step association/dissociation of large ribonucleoprotein  complexes and modulation of complex rna structures, including pre-mrna processing, ribosome biogenesis, rna turnover, rna export and translation  <cit> . thus, the higher expression levels of these two genes in co27lt indicate that they may also be important in the tgms process.

c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins  constitute one of the largest nucleic acid-binding protein families in eukaryote genomes. they have diverse functions, from dna or rna binding to involvement in protein-protein interactions. zfps of oryza sativa are called zos and the corresponding genes are numbered in the order of their physical positions on the chromosomes  <cit> . the tigr database includes  <dig> zos genes with corresponding locus ids, some of which are regulated by abiotic  stresses  <cit> . expression of c2h <dig> family genes is particularly strong during panicle development in rice  <cit> , and one  is involved in floral development  <cit> . we found that expression of zos8- <dig>  was down-regulated in co27ht compared with h1493ht, but restored to normal levels in tgms-co <dig> plants at low temperature. thus, it may have a different mode of action to other genes involved in splicing. another “key regulatory” gene involved in post-transcriptional processes , which was up-regulated in co27lt, encodes a polyadenylate-binding protein. this is an essential, well-conserved, multifunctional protein that is involved in polyadenylation, export of mrnas to the cytoplasm, translation initiation, translation termination, mrna biogenesis and degradation  <cit> . in summary, our results indicate that rs-containing zinc finger proteins, ptbs, dead/deah box rna helicases, zos, one or more polyadenylate-binding proteins, and some other rrm-containing proteins are important for post-transcriptional processes involved in tgms .table  <dig>

hh and hl refer to h <dig> plants grown at high temperature and low temperature, respectively, while co27h and co27l refer to tgms-co <dig> plants grown at high temperature and low temperature, respectively. significant changes  are indicated by boldface.



as mentioned, tgms-co <dig> plants accumulated ugpase protein in their inflorescences at low temperature although the ugp <dig> gene was cosuppressed in them and small amounts of correctly spliced ugp <dig> mrnas were detected by pcr . thus, we predicted that some degs between co27ht and co27lt involved in translational processes may be important for the accumulation of ugpase protein in co27lt. in this section, we mainly discuss the “key regulatory” genes of this type that we identified. translational control of existing mrnas allows for more rapid changes in cellular concentrations of the encoded proteins than transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. the translation process can be divided into initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling, but translation initiation is the most important stage for the regulation of protein synthesis  <cit> . this involves the assembly of elongation-competent 80s ribosomes  and requires at least nine eukaryotic initiation factors , numbered eif1- <dig>  <cit> . the 40s subunit first binds eif <dig> and an eif2-gtp-initiator transfer rna ternary complex, then the 48s initiation complex is assembled with the help of many eifs via numerous steps  <cit> . eif5b , which was most strongly expressed in both rice lines at low temperature, is essential for the binding of 60s subunits and dissociation of eif <dig>  eif1a, eif <dig> and residual eif2–gdp  <cit> . ribosomes play a basic housekeeping role in global translation. four genes encoding ribosomal proteins  were up-regulated in both rice lines at low temperature. previous studies have shown that the expression of the 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> and two 40s ribosomal proteins of arabidopsis increases during low-temperature treatment, indicating that they might enhance translation or support proper ribosome assembly and functions at low temperatures  <cit> . thus, eif5b and the four ribosomal proteins that we found to be induced by low temperature may enhance translation of ugp <dig> transcripts in low-temperature conditions. in addition, there are recent indications that ribosomal protein genes have regulatory roles in plant development  <cit> .

aminoacyl-trna synthetases  are housekeeping enzymes that are essential for protein synthesis and have many other functions including participation in dna replication, rna splicing and eukaryotic cell processes related to cytokine function and cell cycle control  <cit> . several ars genes are reportedly involved in gametogenesis and embryo development in arabidopsis  <cit> . seven arss were up-regulated in co27lt relative to co27ht, and may be essential for the accumulation of ugpase protein in co27lt. another gene induced in co27lt, which may play a role in translational termination, encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor tu . homologous proteins are the most abundant proteins in most bacterial cells and have established roles in translation and other processes, including cell shape maintenance  <cit> . nascent polypeptide chains should be released from peptidyl-trna when the ribosome encounters a stop signal in the mrna being translated. peptide chain release factor proteins play an essential role in this process  <cit> . loc_os05g <dig> encodes a peptide chain release factor protein and was up-regulated in co27lt. thus, together with the eef-tu gene it may play an important role in the termination of ugpase protein translation.

in summary, eif5b, four ribosomal proteins , seven arss, eef-tu and a peptide chain release factor protein may play significant translational roles in tgms .

qrt-pcr analysis
to validate our microarray data, qrt-pcr analysis was performed on  <dig> randomly selected degs that are probably important for pollen development, low temperature responses or tgms . the results, in terms of relative expression levels among the four sample types, were consistent with the microarray data, especially for loc_os01g <dig>  loc_os03g <dig>  loc_os04g <dig>  loc_os02g <dig>  loc_os09g <dig> and loc_os11g <dig>  although differences in expression levels of other genes were smaller than those detected in the microarray analysis. overall, we conclude that our microarray data are highly credible.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
our microarray analysis revealed that temperature strongly influences global gene expression, indicating that plants may fine-tune their expression profiles in adaptive responses to temperature changes that optimize their growth and reproduction processes. numerous genes involved in pollen development, particularly genes required for cell wall biosynthesis, were repressed in tgms-co <dig> plants at high temperature. we also identified a cluster of temperature-inducible genes  that appear to be vital for sterility transition. many enriched genes of this cluster are associated with the meiosis stage, indicating that low temperature may be a common regulator of fertility alterations in pgms/tgms rice lines. in combination with previous findings, our results also indicate that rs-containing zinc finger proteins, ptbs, dead/deah box rna helicases, zos, polyadenylate-binding proteins, and some other rrm-containing proteins play key post-transcriptional roles in the male sterility of tgms-co <dig> plants, while eif5b, several ribosomal proteins , arss, eef-tu and a peptide chain release factor protein play important translational roles. however, further studies are needed to verify the functions of these candidate genes and improve our understanding of tgms mechanisms.
