BACKGROUND
the organ of corti consists of four parallel rows of sensory hair cells along the longitudinal axis of the spiraled cochlea. the first row of hair cells from the center, or the medial side, of the cochlea are known as inner hair cells . the remaining three rows of hair cells toward the periphery, or the lateral side, of the cochlea are known as outer hair cells . invariably, hair cells are separated from each other by several types of morphologically distinct non-sensory supporting cells. the mosaic cellular arrangement in the organ of corti allows the tissue to sustain mechanic transduction and to maintain homeostasis required for the function and survival of the organ of corti.

the precise cellular architect of the organ of corti provides a unique system to examine mechanisms underlying cellular patterning. during development, the precursor cells that give rise to both the sensory hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of corti exit the cell cycle around embryonic day  <dig>   in mice  <cit> . subsequently, hair cell differentiation initiates near the base of the cochlea at the inner hair cell location and gradually reaches the ends of the cochlear duct along the longitudinal axis and toward the outer-most row of outer hair cells laterally  <cit> . the differentiation of hair cells requires a basic helix-loop-helix  protein, atonal homolog  <dig>  or mouse atonal homolog  <dig>   <cit> . the differentiation of the supporting cells appears to follow that of hair cells  <cit> . the molecular mechanism underlying the mosaic arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells has been shown to involve notch signaling-mediated lateral inhibition  <cit> . during notch signaling, the expression of a transcription activating bhlh gene, such as math <dig>  leads to the expression of notch ligands at hair cell membranes  <cit> . notch ligands bind to the receptor notch on neighboring cells to activate notch  <cit> . as a consequence of notch activation, hairy and enhancer of split  homologs or hairy-related  bhlh transcriptional repressors  <cit>  are expressed, which suppress the expression of the activating bhlh gene in these neighboring cells  <cit> . the neighboring cells therefore adopt a different cell fate. in zebrafish, mutations in notch signaling transform inner ear sensory organs into epithelia consisting entirely of hair cells  <cit> , supporting notch-mediated lateral inhibition in patterning sensory mosaics of the inner ear. in mice, components of notch signaling, such as notch ligands delta-like <dig>  and jagged <dig> , notch <dig>  hes <dig> and hes <dig>  are expressed in the organ of corti during terminal differentiation of the organ of corti  <cit> . consistent with their expression in the cochlear epithelium, loss-of-function of these genes leads to mis-patterning of the hair cells and variously increased numbers of hair cells  <cit> . these data together indicates that notch signaling regulates cellular patterning of inner ear sensory organs in mammals.

patterning defects within notch mutants vary greatly. in particular, notch <dig> mutants and dll1; jag <dig> double mutants have greatly increased numbers of hair cells and drastically altered patterning of the organ of corti  <cit>  while hes <dig> and hes <dig> mutants have much weaker patterning defects  <cit> , implicating compensatory pathways for hes <dig> and hes <dig> in the organ of corti. to explore compensating genes for hes <dig> and hes <dig>  we used differential gene expression profiling and candidate gene approaches and identified the expression of two additional hairy-related genes, hey <dig> and hey <dig>  <cit> , in the cochlea during terminal differentiation of the organ of corti. we further analyzed the function of hey <dig> in the development of the organ of corti.

RESULTS
dynamic expression of hey <dig> in the developing inner ear
the inner ear is derived from the otic placode near the hindbrain. in mice, the otic placode invaginates to form an enclosed otocyst by e <dig> . by e <dig> , specific molecular markers are expressed in regions that are designated for different cell lineages  <cit> . in particular, transcriptional factor islet <dig>  marks the sensory and neuronal lineages of the inner ear at early otocyst stages   <cit> . message rna for otoconin <dig>   <cit> , a major protein component of murine otoconia , is localized to anterior and lateral regions of the otocyst . we compared the expression of hey <dig> at e <dig>  to that of isl <dig> and oto <dig> . hey <dig> is expressed in the medial region of the otic epithelium . its expression abuts isl1-expressing and oto90-expressing domains at its posterior and anterior boundaries, respectively . therefore, at early otocyst stages, the expression of hey <dig> appears to be complementary to the sensory and neuronal lineages of the inner ear and excluded from cells expressing oto <dig> 

we further examined the expression of hey <dig> in later stages in the cochlea . at e <dig> , the precursor cells that will give rise to hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of corti are post-mitotic and are demarcated by the expression of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27/kip <dig>   <cit> . the expression of isl <dig> also marks the primordial organ of corti   <cit> . at this stage, a notch target gene hes <dig> is expressed in a broad region medial to the sensory region   <cit> , while the expression of hes <dig> has begun at the medial boundary of the sensory primordium and marks the differentiating inner hair cells   <cit> . the expression of oto <dig> is restricted to the roof of the cochlear duct . the expression of hey <dig> appears in a region overlapping with the developing organ of corti . careful comparisons with different molecular markers in the adjacent sections led us to conclude that the expression domain of hey <dig> may be shifted slightly to the medial side of the developing organ of corti marked by the expression of isl <dig> and p27/kip <dig> . in addition, another hey gene  <cit> , hey <dig>  is expressed in the primordial organ of corti at this stage . in contrast to hey <dig> and hey <dig> and hes <dig>  hes <dig> was not detected in the cochlea at e <dig>  .

following the establishment of the post-mitotic primordial organ of corti, the differentiation of hair cells and supporting cells is initiated near the base of the cochlea at the inner hair cell region  <cit> . by e <dig> , the organ of corti in the basal to medial regions of the cochlea has been patterned into a sensory mosaic consisting of one row of inner and three rows of outer hair cells interdigitated with supporting cells . from a cross section of the cochlear duct, hair cells are seen at the lumenal layer while the nuclei of supporting cells are localized to the basal layer of the cochlear epithelium , and the cytoplasmic phalangeal processes of supporting cells project into the lumenal hair cell layer to separate hair cells from each other. we compared the expression of a basic helix-loop-helix gene, hes <dig>  in the cochlea at e <dig>  to several other molecular markers. as we have previously shown  <cit> , hes <dig> is restricted to the hair cells at the lumenal layer at this stage . in contrast, hes <dig> message rna is limited to the supporting cell nuclei   <cit> . similarly, the expression of hey <dig>  and hey <dig>  is also seen in the supporting cells. by e <dig> , the expression of hey <dig> has been down-regulated starting from the base of the cochlea to the apex, while the expression of hey <dig> still remains in the supporting cells .

the early onset of hey <dig> in the developing inner ear at e <dig>  and the broad expression of hey <dig> in the cochlea at e <dig>  suggest that its initial expression might precede hair cell and supporting cell differentiation in the cochlea. to test this possibility, we examined the expression of hey <dig> in math1-/- animals  <cit> , and compared its expression with that of hes <dig> and isl <dig> . in the absence of math <dig>  the primordial organ of corti marked by the expressed of p27/kip <dig> is established  <cit> . however, hair cells fail to differentiate and cells within the primordial organ of corti die  <cit> . hes <dig> marks the sensory lineage in the developing inner ear and its expression in cochlear hair cells depends on math <dig>  <cit> . in math1-/- cochleae, hes <dig> was not expressed . isl <dig> is expressed early in the otocyst and its expression in the organ of corti is independent of math <dig>   <cit> . similar to isl <dig>  hey <dig> was expressed in the otocyst and its expression was maintained in the cochlear epithelium in math1-/- animals at e <dig>  .

in summary, hey  <dig> is expressed in the otocyst prior to the formation of the cochlear duct; its onset in the cochlea is independent of math1; and its expression in the cochlea is dynamic, partially overlapping with hes <dig> and hes <dig> in the developing cochlea . an additional hey gene, hey <dig>  is also expressed in an overlapping pattern with hey <dig> 

hey <dig> plays a role in patterning outer hair cells
to examine whether the dynamic expression of hey <dig> in the inner ear is required for inner ear development, we examined the loss-of-function of hey <dig> in mice. hey2-/- animals die around postnatal day  <dig>  due to massive postnatal cardiac hypertrophy and isolated ventricular septal defects  <cit> . we therefore examined inner ears from hey2-/- animals from e <dig>  to p <dig>  morphologically, no visible abnormality was observed in inner ears isolated from hey2-/- animals at all the stages examined . upon molecular examinations using cell type-specific antibodies, we consistently observed a minor patterning defect in the organ of corti from hey2-/- animals . in comparison to the normal three rows of outer hair cells in wild-type littermates , cochlear whole mount preparations from hey2-/- animals stained for hair cell-specific marker myosin <dig> showed segments of an additional row of outer hair cells . the apparent patterning defect in outer hair cells in hey2-/- animals is reminiscent of that observed in hes5-/- animals  <cit> , and the number of additional outer hair cells in hey2-/- animals is comparable to that observed in hes5-/-  animals among littermates .

hey <dig> belongs to the same bhlh gene sub-family as hes <dig>  which can function as downstream targets for notch signaling  <cit> . the similarity in patterning defect observed in hey2-/- and hes5-/- animals suggests that hey <dig> may play a similar role as hes <dig> in the organ of corti. the partially overlapping expression of hey <dig> and hes <dig>  during terminal differentiation of the organ of corti and the weak patterning defect in hey2-/- or hes5-/- animals further suggested that hey <dig> may function redundantly with hes <dig> for patterning the organ of corti. to test this possibility, we crossed animals carrying mutant alleles for both hey <dig> and hes <dig>  and compared hey2-/- , hes5-/- , and hey2-/-; hes5-/-  littermates, and quantified the number of mis-patterned outer hair cells in these animals . we found a statistically significant increase in the numbers of mis-patterned outer hair cells in hey2-/-; hes5-/- animals  in comparison to hey2-/-  or hes5-/-  animals . the effect of genetic inactivation of hey <dig> and hes <dig> on the patterning of outer hair cells appeared to be additive .

hey <dig> functions in parallel with hes <dig> in patterning inner hair cells
in addition to the presence of segments of additional row of outer hair cells, we also observed variable amounts of inner hair cell doublets in hey2-/- animals , in contrast to a single row of inner hair cells in control animals . however, statistic analyses showed that there is no significant increase in the number of inner hair cell doublets in hey2-/- animals  in comparison to wild-type  control littermates . since hey <dig> shows a partial overlapping expression with a homologous gene, hes <dig>  at the onset of terminal differentiation of the organ of corti  and the loss of hes <dig> results in an increase in inner hair cell doublets and, to a lesser degree, an additional row of outer hair cells   <cit> , we sought to determine whether hey <dig> plays a redundant role to hes <dig> in development of the organ of corti.

as reported previously, hes1-/- animals show progressively increased lethality after e <dig>   <cit> . we found that hes1-/-; hey2-/- animals have a complete penetrance in early embryonic lethality. all of the hes1-/-; hey2-/- animals died before e <dig> , prior to the terminal differentiation of the organ of corti. in addition, in littermate crosses between hes1+/-; hey2+/- double heterozygotes and hey2+/- single heterozygotes or within hes1+/-; hey2+/-double heterozygotes, eight hes1+/-; hey2-/- embryos were expected, none of which were recovered after e <dig> , indicating a strong genetic interaction between hey <dig> and hes <dig> for early development and survival of mouse embryos.

we were able to recover hes1-/- and hes1-/-; hey2+/- embryos and analyzed organs of corti isolated from these animals . in comparison to hes1-/- animals that showed frequent inner hair cell doublets , the loss of a single copy of hey <dig> in the hes1-/- background  led to a  <dig> fold-increase in the number of inner hair cell doublets . since hey2+/- had no more inner hair cell doublets than control samples , the increase in inner hair cell doublets in hes1-/-; hey2+/- animals appeared to be synergistic rather than additive. these data together indicate that hey <dig> genetically interacts with hes <dig> for early development of mouse embryos and for patterning inner hair cells in the organ of corti.

ectopic hair cells in hey <dig> compound mutant animals are accompanied by an increase in surrounding supporting cells
the mis-patterning of hair cells in hes <dig> and hes <dig> mutants was observed previously  <cit> . it was thought that the conversion of supporting cells to hair cells might account for the abnormality observed in hes <dig> and hes <dig> mutants, as predicted from a simple lateral inhibition model  <cit> . however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been tested. we observed enhanced phenotypes in hes <dig> and hey <dig> and in hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants , and explored the molecular roles of hes family genes in patterning the organ of corti.

we examined the cellular architect of the organ of corti in control and hey <dig> compound mutants in whole mount preparations and cross sections of the organ of corti . the precise rows of hair cells  are mirrored by corresponding parallel rows of supporting cells in the organ of corti   <cit> . as reported previously  <cit>  an antibody against a homeodomain transcriptional factor, prox <dig>  distinctively labeled outer pillar cells  between the inner and outer hair cells, and four rows of supporting cells that alternate with the three rows of outer hair cells . in hes5-/-;hey2-/- samples, the ectopic row of outer hair cells  were accompanied by an additional row of supporting cells . in hes1-/-;hey2+/- animals, the ectopic outer hair cells were also associated with additional supporting cells .

since inner hair cell doublets were observed in hes1-/-;hey2+/- animals, we also attempted to examine the arrangement of inner hair cells and its surrounding supporting cells in the mutant and wild-type cochleae . an antibody against p27/kip <dig> marks all the supporting cells at this stage . however, the supporting cells surrounding inner hair cells labeled by p27/kip <dig> at e <dig> , the latest surviving stage for hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants, showed variable arrangements in control cochleae . we could not determine whether the number of supporting cells surrounding inner hair cells changes accordingly in hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants . nevertheless, it is apparent that the ectopic inner hair cells in hes1-/-;hey2+/- animals do not contact other inner hair cells and are interdigitated by non-hair cells as shown in whole mount preparations of the mutant organ of corti , implying a preserved mosaic arrangement of inner hair cells and supporting cells in hes1-/-;hey2+/- animals.

no prolonged cell division was detected in the organ of corti isolated from hey <dig> mutants
the mirror increase in supporting cells in hes5-/-;hey2-/- and hes1-/-;hey2+/- animals was not predicted from a simple lateral inhibition model  <cit> , but consistent with an emerging complex role for the notch signaling pathway. indeed, the hes homologous genes hes <dig> and hes <dig> can regulate sequential stages during neurogenesis in several nervous systems  <cit> . initially, they define the domain undergoing neurogenesis and, subsequently, control the number of neural progenitors within the neurogenic domain. notch signaling can affect cell division and/or cell fate determination to regulate the pool of progenitor cells at both stages  <cit> . in the cochlea, mutations in notch receptor or ligands lead to perturbations in cell division  <cit> . cell proliferation was observed in notch or notch ligand mutants after e <dig> , when cells in the organ of corti have withdrawn from the cell cycle in wild-type animals  <cit> . to determine whether prolonged cell division contributes to mis-patterning and ectopic hair cells and supporting cells in hey <dig>  hes <dig>  and hes <dig> mutants, we analyzed the incorporation of a nucleotide analog, brdu, in the organ of corti from e <dig> –e <dig>  .

brdu was injected into timed-pregnant mice at e <dig> , and embryos were collected the same day after three consecutive injections . in control mice, the organ of corti was post-mitotic as demonstrated by the lack of brdu incorporation in the region at e <dig>  . no proliferating cells were detected in the primordial organ of corti in hes1-/-;hey2+/- embryos at e <dig>  . furthermore, to facilitate the identification of proliferating cells in the organ of corti after e <dig> , embryos injected with brdu at e <dig>  for three times were not collected until e <dig> , allowing a longer chasing period for the incorporation of brdu . hair cells generated after e <dig>  would be readily detected in embryos harvested at e <dig> . the control e <dig>  embryos had no brdu+ cells in the organ of corti . in hes1-/-;hey2+/- e <dig>  embryos, no brdu+ cells were detected . similar results were obtained with hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants , indicating that no detectable extension of cell proliferation contributes to the ectopic hair cells and supporting cells in hes1-/-;hey2+/-  or hes5-/-;hey2-/-  mutants. since hes1-/-;hes5-/- or hes1-/-;hey2-/- embryos die early in development, we could not examine perturbation of cell division in these mutants.

discussion
hes <dig> and hes <dig> play essential roles in patterning inner and outer hair cells, respectively  <cit> . in addition, they appear to interact mutually for the patterning of both inner and outer hair cells in the development of the organ of corti  <cit> . in this study, we show that the expression of hey <dig> overlaps with that of hes <dig> and hes <dig>  and that the patterning defects in the organ of corti in hes <dig> or hes <dig> mutants were increased in hes <dig> and hey <dig> , and hes <dig> and hey <dig>  compound mutants. these data together suggested that all three genes interact genetically to regulate patterning of the organ of corti.

theoretically, the production of ectopic hair cells may be resulted from conversion of supporting cells to hair cells, prolonged cell proliferation, expansion of the boundaries of the developing postmitotic sensory organ, and/or an increased pool of progenitor cells. previous studies indicate that prolonged cell proliferation occurs in notch or notch ligand mutants after e <dig>   <cit> , in addition to possible conversion of some supporting cells to hair cells in these mutants  <cit> . it is not known whether an increased pool of progenitor cells, or expansion of the boundaries of the postmitotic sensory primordium may also contribute to the hyperplasia of the organ of corti in these notch or notch ligand mutants. the expression of hey <dig> in supporting cells during terminal differentiation  is consistent with a role for mediating lateral inhibition, or repressing the cells surrounding hair cells to take on the same hair cell fate. such a role would predict a loss of supporting cells to account for the ectopic hair cells in hey <dig> mutants. surprisingly, we not only did not see a decrease in supporting cells but also observed ectopic supporting cells associated with ectopic hair cells in hes <dig> and hey <dig> and in hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants . in addition, we did not detect any perturbation of cell division in hes <dig> and hey <dig> and in hes <dig> and hey <dig> compound mutants after e <dig>  .

these observations imply that an increased pool of progenitor cells prior to terminal mitosis and/or expansion of the boundaries of the postmitotic sensory primordium may account for the hyperplasia observed in hes1;hey <dig> and hes5;hey <dig> compound mutants. consistent with either hypothesized roles, hey <dig> also shows an early expression in the developing otocyst prior to the formation of the cochlea  and in the cochlea prior to the terminal differentiation of the organ of corti , in addition to its expression in the supporting cells in the differentiating organ of corti . at e <dig> , the expression of hey <dig> in the otocyst is excluded from the expression domain of isl <dig> , which marks the neuronal and sensory lineages of the inner ear  <cit> . at e <dig>  when hair cell differentiation has just begun in the inner hair cell region at the base of the cochlear duct, hey <dig> is restricted to a domain that may be slightly medial to the primordial organ of corti , and this expression of hey <dig> in the cochlea is independent of math <dig> . it is possible that, consistent with the dual role of notch signaling in neurogenesis, hey <dig> has a role in redundantly restricting the pools for neuroprogenitors or the regions for the sensori-neural lineages of the inner ear, and/or the boundaries of the sensory primordium. the small but quantitatively significant defect made it impossible to detect whether there is an enlarged progenitor pool, through extra cell divisions or expansion of the lineage boundaries prior to terminal mitosis, and/or whether the boundaries of the developing organ of corti during terminal differentiation are expanded.

in comparison to recovered hes1; hey <dig>  hes5;hey <dig> , or hes1;hes <dig> compound mutants  <cit> , notch or notch ligand mutations cause a similar but much stronger patterning defect  <cit> . early embryonic lethality associated with hes1;hes <dig> and hes1;hey <dig> compound mutants prevented us to recover double mutants carrying homozygous mutant alleles for hes <dig> and hes <dig>  hes <dig> and hey <dig>  or triple mutants. hence, we were unable to conclusively ascertain whether hes <dig>  hes <dig> and hey <dig> are the key players mediating notch signaling in the organ of corti and whether additional players are involved. indeed, an additional hairy-related gene, hey <dig>  is also expressed in the organ of corti during terminal differentiation . it remains to be tested whether inactivation of other combinations or all of the hes and hey genes expressed in the developing cochlea by conditional inactivation will replicate the morphologic and molecular defects in notch or notch ligand mutants.

cellular patterning defects also occur in planar cell polarity  mutants  <cit> . cellular rearrangements characteristic of convergent extension occur during terminal differentiation of the organ of corti and lead to extension of the cochlear duct  <cit> . in pcp signaling mutants, the process of convergent extension is inhibited. the cochlear extension and the organ of corti patterning defects in pcp mutants are accompanied by misorientation of stereociliary bundles of hair cells  <cit> . the patterning defects in hes1-/-;hey2+/- or hes5-/-;hey2-/- mutants are distinctly different from that of pcp mutants. the extra row of outer hair cells or inner hair cell doublets in hes5-/-;hey2-/- or hes1-/-;hey2+/- mutants, respectively, were seen distributed along the entire length of the cochlear duct . no misorientation of stereociliary bundles and no shortening of the cochlear duct were observed in hes1-/-;hey2+/- or hes5-/-;hey2-/- mutants . however, these cochlear duct defects have been observed in notch and notch ligand mutants that show significantly increased hair cell numbers in the unit length of the cochlear duct  <cit> . it is not clear whether inactivation of all the family members of hey and hes genes will replicate also the pcp-like cochlear duct defects of notch mutants and whether the mis-patterning of hair cells in notch and notch ligand mutants is directly resulted from compromised convergent extension of the cochlear duct or a manifestation of altered cell fate determination and cell proliferation when notch signaling is affected.

while members of the putative notch target genes interact genetically in patterning the organ of corti, their expressions show dynamically distinct, albeit overlapping, patterns in the developing cochlea. accordingly, hey <dig> and hes <dig> appear to play a more important role in outer hair cells than in the inner hair cells while hey <dig> and hes <dig> act synergistically for correct patterning of the inner hair cells. these observations indicate a complex network of notch target genes with temporal and spatially distinct and overlapping roles regulating the patterning of the organ of corti and, possibly, cell lineage determination in the otocyst.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that the expression of hey <dig> overlaps with that of two notch target genes, hes <dig> and hes <dig> , and that the patterning defects in the organ of corti in hes <dig> or hes <dig> mutants were increased in hes1;hey <dig>  and hes5; hey <dig> compound mutants . these data together suggested that hey <dig> interacts genetically with hes <dig> and hes <dig> to regulate patterning of the organ of corti. in addition, early embryonic lethality is observed in hey2-/-;hes1-/- and hey2-/-;hes1+/- mice, indicating that hey <dig> interacts with hes <dig> for early embryonic development and survival. we also explored the underlying molecular role for hey <dig> and its family members, hes <dig> and hes <dig>  we found that neither conversion of supporting cells  to hair cells nor prolonged cell division  can be detected to account for the hyperplasia of the organ of corti in hey <dig> compound mutants. it is possible that an increase in the progenitor pool, by accelerated cell proliferation and expansion of the boundaries of the sensory domain prior to terminal mitosis, and/or the expansion of the boundaries of the developing sensory organ during terminal differentiation, may result in production of ectopic hair cells associated with ectopic supporting cells.
