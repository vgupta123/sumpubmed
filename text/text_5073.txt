BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a devastating disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord leading to muscle weakness. als can occur at anytime in adulthood. initial manifestations are weakness of limbs, or weakness in the bulbar region leading to abnormalities of speech, swallowing difficulties and facial weakness. the patient eventually becomes paralyzed and approximately 50% of patients die within  <dig> years after onset of symptoms, usually as the result of respiratory failure. the predominant presentation of als is sporadic accounting for >90% of cases whereas familiar als affects less than 10% of the patients, usually with autosomal dominant inheritance. genetic linkage studies have successfully identified several als-related genes in the familial forms of the disease. up to 20% of the familial cases are linked to mutations in the cupper-zinc  superoxide dismutase- <dig>  gene on chromosome 21q <dig> . sporadic and familial als are clinically indistinguishable except for a slightly earlier age of onset in familial variants.

the pathogenesis of sporadic als is largely unknown, but there is emerging evidence that several distinct molecular mechanisms may play a role including oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, protein misfolding, apoptosis, inflammation, dysfunction of axonal transport, and mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . recently, four genome-wide genetic association  studies have been performed to identify common genetic variation involved in susceptibility to sporadic als  <cit> . the gwa studies resulted in three new candidate genes for als, namely fggy , itpr <dig>  and dpp <dig> . recently, a validation study for dpp <dig> was reported  <cit> . other initial findings await further genetic validation, especially given the fact that these studies were performed in relatively small sample sizes compared to gwa studies of other, more prevalent, complex traits  <cit> .

while there is evidence of genetic heterogeneity underlying disease susceptibility, clinical manifestations of the devastating als phenotype are relatively homogeneous. the latter suggests that at the cellular and molecular level only a limited number of pathways may be involved in disease susceptibility and progression. the identification of molecular pathways related to als remains an important challenge, nevertheless. gene expression studies of spinal cord tissue from human sod <dig> transgenic als mice and autopsied als patients have identified upregulation of genes involved in specific pathogenic pathways such as antioxidant systems, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory cascades  <cit> 

drawbacks of previous studies include limited sample size, the use of monogenetic animal models, or human tissue from autopsy at the very end stage of motor neuron degeneration.

as many essential genes and signaling cascades are expressed in blood cells, suggesting that parts of their regulatory networks also exist in blood, we hypothesized that blood gene expression profiles could help elucidate pathways underlying disease etiology. a number of studies describe the search for blood markers for diseases without known clinical phenotypes present in peripheral blood. a proof-of-principle study of blood gene expression profiling in neurological disease was initially performed in a rat model in which a number of neurological conditions  were induced  <cit> . different patterns of gene expression were observed in peripheral blood cells one day after each experimental cerebral condition indicating the potential for applying genomic microarray technology to identifying peripheral markers of neurological disease. more recent studies show further evidence that peripheral blood gene expression can be used as a fingerprint of neurological diseases, including huntington's disease, alzheimer's disease and autism  <cit> .

RESULTS
standard gene expression analysis based on peripheral blood
we collected blood data from three independent patient sets . controls were matched for age and gender, with mean age between  <dig> and  <dig> at time of blood collection. we obtained a discovery dataset of  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls , a replication dataset of same size  and a third dataset with  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls  amounting to a total of  <dig> als patients and  <dig> controls. datasets  <dig> and  <dig> have similar proportions male/females and spinal/bulbar onset in patients. dataset  <dig> has more male subjects  and more spinal onset patients .

for the three independent datasets, we report sample sizes and patient characteristics. the close similarity between patients and controls reflects the fact that healthy controls were chosen such that they matched the age and gender of the patients.

¶ median years 

using a student t-test for comparing gene expression between als cases and healthy controls, we calculated a statistical significance level  for each of the  <dig> probes present in the discovery set. at a false discovery rate of  <dig> ,  <dig> probes are differentially expressed between als cases and controls. in additional file  <dig>  we report the fold change, the p-value, and the benjamini hochberg correction for each of these differentially expressed probes. a drawback of a standard analysis is that it ignores the strong correlation patterns between probes, which may lead to an erroneous estimate of the false discovery rate. but a more serious drawback of the standard analysis is that it fails to see the forest for the trees. below, we will show that two large clusters of genes  relate to als disease status. these modules turn out to be highly enriched with known gene ontologies which provides insights into the pathogenesis of als.

to predict als status based on the gene expression profiles, we used two alternative prediction methods: a random forest predictor and a k-nearest neighbor . unbiased test set estimates of the prediction accuracy show that both predictors classify 80% of the samples correctly. while the accuracy is relatively high , it is not clear whether a molecularly predictor of als  would be clinically relevant. a more basic research question is to identify disease related pathways and gene networks since this may lead to insights regarding the disease etiology and possible treatment regiments. gene co-expression network methods have been successfully applied in a variety of different settings  <cit> .

weighted gene co-expression network analysis
here we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  in a first attempt to identify als associated coexpression modules and their key constituents. wgcna starts from the level of thousands of genes, identifies modules of co-expressed genes, and relates these modules to clinical variables and gene ontology information. because gene modules may correspond to biological pathways, focusing the analysis on modules  amounts to a biologically meaningful data reduction scheme.

highly correlated module genes are represented and summarized by their first principal component . the module eigengenes are used to define measures of module membership which quantify how close a gene is to a given module. module membership measures allow one to annotate all genes on the array and to screen for disease related intramodular hub genes  <cit> . as described below, we use functional enrichment analysis with regard to known gene ontologies to understand the biological significance of module genes and to identify putative disease pathways.

detection of co-expression modules related to als
we applied wgcna to probes with a significant mean detection level . hierarchical clustering applied to the discovery set  led to the identification of five co-expression modules ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> genes . as can be seen from the color-band underneath the cluster tree, modules correspond to branches and are color-coded . grey is used to color background genes that are not grouped into any module.

to assess the robustness of the co-expression module definition, we replicated module detection in the second and third dataset  where we colored the genes according to the module color in data set  <dig>  the fact that genes of the same color stay close together in the three different cluster trees  shows that the blue and yellow module are highly preserved across the three data sets.

differentially expressed genes tend to be in the blue or yellow module
our module definition was solely based on the gene expression levels in peripheral blood and ignored als disease status. to incorporate a clinical outcome into the network analysis, wgcna makes use of suitably defined gene significance measure. here we defined the gene significance measure as the student t-test statistic for testing differential expression between cases and controls. thus, a large absolute value of the gene significance measure corresponds to a small 2-sided p-value. we found that the gene significance measures in the three independent data were highly correlated . thus, the gene significance measures is highly reproducible across the three data sets. figure 2a–b shows that genes that are consistently up-regulated in als cases tend to be part of the blue module while genes that are consistently down-regulated tend to be in the yellow module.

two co-expression modules are significantly associated with als
we defined a measure of module significance as average absolute gene significance across the module genes. figure 1b shows that the blue and yellow module genes were highly enriched with differentially expressed genes in the  <dig> independent data sets. the module significance  of the blue module corresponds to p-values  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in datasets  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the module significance of the yellow module genes corresponds to p values  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in datasets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. combining all datasets resulted in highly significant p values:  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for the blue module and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for the yellow module.

an alternative and statistically preferable way of relating a module to als disease status is to correlate disease status with a suitably defined module representative. as module representative, we used the module eigengene  which is defined as the first principal component of the module expression profiles. the correlations between als status and the module eigengene of the blue module  were r =  <dig>  , r =  <dig>  , and r =  <dig>   in data sets  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. note that the p-values remain highly significant even after using the most stringent multiple comparison correction  since only  <dig> comparisons  were carried out. this illustrates a statistical advantage of wgcna: instead of correcting the analysis for tens of thousands of gene comparisons, a module-based analysis involves orders of magnitudes fewer comparisons. for the yellow module eigengene meyellow we found highly significant negative correlations with als status: r = - <dig>  , - <dig>  , - <dig>   in data sets  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the negative correlations reflect that most yellow module genes were under-expressed in als patients.

no significant relationship between modules and other clinical variables
we related the module eigengenes to other clinical variables but did not find any other significant associations. in particular, meblue and meyellow were not significantly associated with age at time of collection, gender, specific characteristics of als patients such as bulbar or spinal onset, age at onset or el escorial criteria at time of collection. a multivariate cox regression analysis that regressed survival time on the module eigengenes, site of onset, sex and age at onset, resulted in no significant p-values for any of the covariates.

using module membership values to annotate the genes with regard to module membership in the data sets
as detailed in the methods section, we made use of a fuzzy measure of module membership  that can be defined for each module. the module membership measure with regard to the blue module mmblue = cor is defined as the correlation between the i-th gene expression profile xi and the blue module eigengene. large absolute values of mmblue indicate that the gene is close to  the blue module. in contrast, if mmblue is  <dig>  then the ith gene is uncorrelated with the blue module eigengene and is unlikely to be part of the blue module. the sign of module membership encodes whether the gene has a positive or a negative relationship with regard to the blue module expression profiles.

we also used a correlation test to compute a corresponding p-value of module membership. we found that the module membership measures of the blue and yellow modules are highly preserved across the three data sets as can be seen from additional file  <dig> 

in additional file  <dig>  we report the individual module membership values with regard to the different modules in each of the data sets and the mean module membership values across the three independent data sets is referred to as meanmmblue.

the wgcna r package also computes a gene selection score  based on gene significance and module membership  <cit> . analogous to a p-value, the smaller the value of p.weighted the stronger is the evidence that the gene is a disease related hub gene.

ingenuity pathway analysis of four top  <dig> gene lists
as detailed in the methods section, we used the module membership values to define four different gene lists. the first and second gene lists consisted of the top  <dig> genes closest to the yellow and the blue module, respectively. the third gene list consisted of  <dig> genes with the lowest wgcna gene selection score p.weighted. for comparison with a standard differential network analysis, we also drafted a fourth list of genes according to the average student t of differential expression across the three data sets.

in the methods section and additional file  <dig>  we provide details on these gene lists including p-values and local false discovery rates . we used ingenuity pathways analysis  to test for enrichment with regard to known gene ontologies. a detailed comparative functional enrichment study of the four lists is presented in additional file  <dig> and a condensed version involving only the first  <dig> lists can be found in additional file  <dig> 

we find that a standard differential analysis  leads to less significant findings than those of a module based analysis . this provides indirect evidence that a module centric analysis of these data leads to more significant biological findings.

we also applied to the biomarker search option of ingenuity to these top  <dig> genes.

the results can be found in additional file  <dig> which reports i) tissues where matching genes have been found to be expressed, and ii) known drugs for matching genes. we report these preliminary results to illustrate how wgcna coupled with ingenuity analysis can be used for generating hypotheses that may form the starting point of future studies.

functional enrichment analysis with david of the top  <dig> disease related intramodular hub genes
we also carried out a functional enrichment analysis with the data base david  <cit> . here we selected the top  <dig> most highly connected genes in both modules. additional file  <dig> reports highly significant gene ontology categories and representative genes.

the most significant pathway is the huntington's disease pathway . other interesting significant pathways include mrna processing, the neurodegenerative disorders pathway , the axon guidance pathway , and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system .

figures  <dig> and  <dig> visualizes the connectivity patterns of the  <dig> intramodular hub genes in the yellow and blue modules, respectively. edges between the intramodular hub genes indicate significant correlations. both modules contain hub genes involved in apoptosis and protein ubiquitination. several hub genes in the blue module are known to be involved in response to stress and vesicle transport. several hub genes in the yellow module play an important role in mitochondrial functioning  <cit> .

discussion
we use  <dig> hitherto unpublished blood gene expression data sets to provide the following novel insights regarding als. first, both a standard differential expression analysis and wgcna show that thousands of genes are differentially expressed between patients and controls in peripheral blood even though als is a disease primarily affecting neuronal tissue.

previous studies have shown similar findings in other neurological diseases. in parkinson's disease  for example, an assay of eight molecular markers in peripheral whole blood results in higher risk scores for pd patients compared to neurodegenerative disease controls and healthy controls  <cit> . in huntington's disease, a monogenetic disease, expression profile clustering in peripheral blood cells could distinguish not only patients from healthy controls, but also pre-symptomatic from symptomatic patients  <cit> . in neuronal disease, coordinated repression and expression of large chromosomal regions was found in caudate nucleus and whole blood  <cit> . in alzheimer's disease, changes were detected in the transcriptome of blood mononuclear cells of patients compared to normal controls  <cit> . these studies and our results support the hypothesis that complex neurological diseases may leave gene expression footprints outside their symptom-related tissue. since peripheral blood is easily accessible, identification of disease-specific gene expression profiles is a promising step toward the development of biomarkers that can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. however, our study also shows that more work is needed before blood gene expression profiling will have diagnostic value in clinical practice. we find that gene expression based predictors of als  have moderate predictive accuracy . similarly, we find that individual genes have moderate sensitivity, specificity and area under the roc curve for distinguishing als versus healthy controls. als biomarker development is especially important for distinguishing als patients from those patients mimicking als symptoms  in early stages of disease. for this reason, future biomarker development needs to include larger sample sizes as well as patients with als mimic disorders.

our network analysis reveals that two large co-expression modules  are significantly associated with als disease status. in three different and independent sample series we consistently observed that genes within the blue module were predominantly up regulated in als patients, whereas genes in the yellow module were predominantly down regulated in all three datasets. we did not observe a significant association between modules and other clinical characteristics of als patients such as gender, age of onset, site of onset or disease progression. our analysis does not address whether the two disease-associated modules are causally involved in als susceptibility or reflect reactive molecular mechanisms in response to onset of disease. we used ingenuity pathway analysis to study the functional enrichment of the disease related modules and als related genes. we find significant enrichment with regard to functional categories related to genetic disorders including psoriatic arthritis , congenital disorders of glycosylation , leigh syndrome , neurodegeneration of the nervous system , inflammatory disease  and connective tissue disorders . there are some reports that skin symptoms such as bedsores and a loss of normal elasticity do occur in als patients  <cit>  but this has not been observed in patients that are included in this study. alternatively, it is possible that that these functional categories represent a broader system of inflammation which is thought to be involved in neurodegeneration in general. we compared our findings with previously published gene expression studies of als patients. since these studies were much smaller in size and often based on post mortem neuronal tissue, a direct comparison using network analysis is hardly possible. we therefore compare gene expression patterns at the level of individual genes from als associated modules. we noticed a diverse functionality of overlapping genes, and only two genes belonged to a module . the largest overlap between a previous study and our analysis was found with expression patterns in motor cortex of  <dig> sporadic als patients and  <dig> control subjects  <cit>  with  <dig> genes coinciding, all down-regulated: abhd <dig>  pigb, ints <dig>  e2f <dig>  bcl <dig>  mfsd <dig>  sat <dig>  agtpbp <dig>  march <dig>  txn, mtmr <dig>  osbpl <dig>  hspbap <dig>  trib <dig>  chuk, ccpg <dig>  down-regulation of atp6v1a was found in a second study on motor cortex with  <dig> sals patients and  <dig> control subjects  <cit> . overlap with expression data generated from laser captured motor neuron of the spinal cord consisted of  <dig> genes, all up-regulated   <cit> . homogenate of whole spinal cord of both sporadic and familial als showed differential expression of cd <dig>  cyba, gys <dig>  pold <dig>  eng, sf <dig>  and camlg, srpk <dig>   <cit>  and upregulation of vil <dig> in a second study  <cit> .

to complement the individual gene information data and to make it a useful resource for others to determine how correlated their gene of interest is to als status and disease related modules, we provide a module based gene annotation table . this table represents for each gene its correlation to the als related modules and how associated it is with als status.

network analysis highlights individual intramodular hub genes that are centrally located in the disease related modules. for example, in the yellow module, glutathione synthetase  is worthy of note, since earlier studies have found a decrease of glutathione reductase in erythrocytes of sporadic als patients  <cit> . glutathione is an important anti-oxidant, mediating defense against lipid peroxidation, shown to be increased in als  <cit> . other stress responsive genes in the yellow module are stip <dig>  and hsp90ab <dig>  functional in the cytoplasm, and idh3b and aco <dig>  functional in the mitochondrion. a decreased ability of motor neurons to mount a defensive response through up regulation of heat-shock proteins, has been suggested to be part of als pathogenesis  <cit> . decreased levels of aconitase- <dig>  was found a potential sensitive and early biomarker for mitochondrial oxidant stress  <cit> . several apoptotic associated genes were found in the blue and yellow modules. arhgdia inactivates rho proteins by preventing dissociation of gdp. one of the genes that serve as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for rab <dig> is alsin. alsin mutations have been reported in a familial als with juvenile onset  <cit> . daxx, central in the yellow module, is a modulator of apoptosis of motor neurons in g93a mutant sod <dig> transgenic mice  <cit> , and is a mediator of the heat-shock protein response  <cit> . in the blue network bnip <dig> , is a central apoptotic gene. bcl- <dig> is shown to be involved in the sod <dig> mediated cascade leading to motor neuron death  <cit> .

two genes in the yellow module are part of the inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate  pathway, itpk and pip5k1a. ip <dig> regulates the calcium homeostasis in the cell and a polymorphism within a receptor for ip <dig>  itpr <dig>  is associated with als in a sample from the same population from the netherlands  <cit> . increased intracellular calcium levels are shown to be crucial for the induction of motor neuron death  <cit> .

an important question is how well our findings fit with current hypotheses of als disease pathophysiology. the most commonly found mutations linked with familial als are those in sod <dig>  the exact  pathway targeted by mutant sod <dig> is not known but the primary function of sod <dig> suggests that oxidative stress is involved which could lead to dysfunction of mitochondria and ultimately apoptosis of the neuron. interestingly, the als associated blue and yellow modules are enriched with a number of genes with oxidative and mitochondrial function, suggesting that similar pathways may be involved in familial and sporadic als. recently, mutations in tardbp and fus are found in familial als  <cit> . these genes both have rna processing functionality and this category too was significantly enriched in the blue module. whether dysfunction of rna processing proteins are part of the same pathogenic pathway as mitochondrial dysfunction is not known, but in our study we found some evidence that both pathways play a role in sporadic als.

we compare the findings of wgcna with those of a standard analysis based on differential expression. as can be seen from our functional enrichment analysis results of different gene lists , keeping track of module membership leads to statistically more significant enrichment results. while a standard analysis implicates thousands of differentially expressed genes, it fails to recognize that these genes are organized into two large co-expression modules. as a result, a standard analysis indiscriminately averages across modules and dilutes the functional enrichment signal inherent in these modules. in contrast, wgcna's systems biologic, module-centric approach hones in on disease related pathways and their key drives.

CONCLUSIONS
weighted gene co-expression network analysis applied to blood gene expression data from als patients is combined with ingenuity pathway analysis to implicate disease pathways, molecular mechanisms, and connections to other disorders. our results suggest that development of an als biomarker based on gene expression in peripheral blood may be possible. moreover, functional insights derived from these genes imply involvement of rna processing and mitochondrion in sporadic als.

for each gene, our module annotation catalogues report the relationship to als disease status and its membership to the als related co-expression modules in blood. our results do not point to a single disease pathway. instead, we find several highly significant pathways and genes in the als related modules. our gene and pathway catalogues are meant to inform additional biological studies.
