BACKGROUND
dna duplication is an important source of novelty regarding evolution, providing the basis for new molecular activities  <cit> . the genomes from the three kingdoms of life have been modulated by this mechanism, having multiple copies of genes  <cit> . multigene families might evolve in line with a concerted or birth-and-death evolutionary model  <cit> ; paralogous genes keep the same function in the former due to gene conversion whilst paralogous genes could lose or acquire a new function in a birth-and-death model. since functional importance is highly correlated with evolutionary conservation  <cit> , molecular biologists have used evolutionary approaches to infer functional changes in paralogous genes/proteins using dna/amino acid sequences .

gene duplication seems to be recurrent in plasmodium genus. these parasites are able to infect several vertebrates such as birds, rodents and primates. more than  <dig> species have been described to date. clustering in different lineages occurs according to host   <cit> . several genes produced by gene duplication are involved in host-cell invasion . msp <dig> is a merozoite surface protein encoded by a gene belonging to a multigene family located in chromosome  <dig> in hominid- and rodent-parasites but in chromosome  <dig> in monkey-parasites. this family has a different copy number amongst plasmodium species  <cit> . these genes are expressed simultaneously but they are independently regulated . functional assays have shown that p. falciparum msp <dig>  is proteolytically processed; the resulting 22 kda c-terminal region fragment is not covalently associated with msp <dig>  <cit>  and has cross-reactivity with other msp <dig> proteins  <cit> . furthermore, this fragment appears be involved in invasion by binding to red blood cells  <cit> . the c-terminal regions in p. yoelii from different msp7s seem to be necessary to interact with the 83 kda msp <dig> fragment  <cit> . the msp <dig> knockout reduces the normal growth rate of the mutant parasite in p. berghei; however, it becomes restored a few days later  <cit> .

the msp <dig> family appears to follow the birth-and-death evolutionary model; some gene copies have been maintained in the genome for a long time and others appear to be more recent  <cit> . this family has had a complex evolutionary history regarding p. vivax. the c-terminal region is involved in gene conversion  <cit> . moreover, this region is highly conserved and under negative selection, suggesting functional/structural constraint ; by contrast, some p. vivax msp <dig> proteins’ central regions have high genetic diversity, maintained by balancing selection, possibly as an immune evasion mechanism  <cit> .

recent protein-protein interaction assays have shown that msp <dig> proteins do not appear to bind to the same host receptor  <cit> ; moreover, these proteins seem to be forming different protein complexes in the parasite , maybe to perform different parasite-host interactions. such results flout the functional redundancy hypothesis  <cit> ; functional divergence in msp <dig> paralogs thus appears to be probable. this study has analysed data concerning msp <dig> multigene family evolution, including  <dig> available plasmodium genomes by evaluating their phylogenetic relationships and adopting different and new molecular evolutionary approaches for assessing functional divergence amongst msp <dig> proteins.

methods
sequence data, alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstruction
genome sequences from  <dig> plasmodium species  as well as the partial genome sequences from p. gallinaceum  were analysed to obtain msp <dig> multigene family genomic regions. the msp <dig> gene copy number for these  <dig> genomes was established, as reported previously  <cit> .

all gene sequences found were used to deduce amino acid sequences by using gene runner software; these sequences were then screened to distinguish the msp_7c domain using the pfam server  <cit>  . all amino acid sequences were then aligned using the muscle algorithm  <cit>  and manually edited by genedoc software  <cit> . the best amino acid substitution model was selected by akaike’s information criterion using the prottest algorithm  <cit> ; the jtt + g + f model was used to infer phylogenetic tress using maximum likelihood  and bayesian  methods. raxml was used for ml analysis  <cit>  and topology reliability was evaluated by bootstrap, using  <dig> replicates. a metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo  algorithm was used for by analysis  <cit>  with mrbayes  <cit> . this analysis was run until reaching a standard deviation of split frequencies  value lower than  <dig> ; sump and sumt commands were used for tabulating posterior probabilities and building a consensus tree; in addition to asdsf, the psrf parameter was used for monitoring convergence. both analyses were performed at cipres science gateway  <cit> . a recent evolutionary multigene family model called dlrts  <cit>  was also performed; this method infers a gene tree by evolving down on a given species tree  by means of duplication, loss and transfer events according to a birth-death-like process  <cit> . the species tree was inferred with a fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> and divergence times were obtained from pacheco et al.  <cit> . dlrts was run using the mcmc algorithm for  <dig> million generations.

gene conversion amongst msp <dig> members
it has been shown that some msp <dig> family members  have evolved by gene conversion, thereby contributing to these members’ homogenisation  <cit> . msp <dig> sequences were obtained from  <dig> p. vivax isolates   <cit>  and used to assess whether this pattern has also taken place in other msp <dig> members. betran’s method was used for gene conversion amongst paralogous genes  <cit>  as well as the geneconv algorithm  <cit> . dnasp software was used for the former method  <cit>  where only conversion tracts larger than  <dig> nucleotides were considered whilst rdp <dig> v <dig>  software was used for geneconv  <cit> , considering just conversion tracts having p <  <dig> . the same approach was followed for p. falciparum msp <dig> genes, using the 3d <dig>  fcr <dig>  ro <dig>  7g <dig>  k <dig>  t9/ <dig> and w2mef isolates.

identifying episodic diversifying selection on msp <dig> tree branches
the random effects branch-site model  was used for assessing whether msp <dig> multigene family lineages had been subject to episodic diversifying selection  <cit> . this method identifies branches where a percentage of sites have evolved under episodic diversifying selection. the muscle algorithm was used for independently aligning each orthologous cluster’s amino acid sequences ; pal2nal software  <cit>  was then used for inferring codon alignments from the aligned amino acid sequences. the best evolutionary models for dna and protein alignments were inferred by using jmodeltest  <cit>  and prottest  <cit> , respectively. ml phylogenetic trees were obtained for dna and protein alignments for each orthologous cluster and used as phylogenetic framework to perform the branch-site rel method using the hyphy software package  <cit> ; additionally, the datamonkey web server  <cit>  was also used to perform this method. the meme method  <cit>  from datamonkey server was used to infer which sites were under episodic positive selection in each cluster.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the chromosomal msp <dig> loci in  <dig> plasmodium genomes. the genes flanking the msp <dig> chromosome region in plasmodium species are represented by orange boxes. the coloured boxes within flanking sequences represent msp <dig> genes in each species whilst black boxes symbolise pseudogenes. the genes are given in alphabetical order from left to right. the dashed lines connect orthologous genes. all genes are represented to scale, but the distance between them is not representative. question marks refer to what were not clearly orthologous relationships. by contrast with hominid-parasites, species from monkey-parasite and rodent-parasite lineages seem to have similar evolutionary histories regarding msp <dig> expansion. the grey boxes are lineage-specific genes only found in hominid-parasite species, as they do not belong to the msp <dig> family

evolutionary analysis for testing functional divergence
functional redundancy was previously proposed for the msp <dig> family by using sequences from seven species  <cit> . the sequence number in this research was increased and two different phylogeny-based approaches were used to assess functional divergence or redundancy between msp <dig> members; one involved using diverge v. <dig> software  <cit>  to estimate type-i functional divergence  <cit>  which is an indicator of functional changes between members of a multigene family . this method is based on  shifted evolutionary rates. it assesses whether there has been a significant change in evolution rate after duplication  events by calculating the coefficient of divergence  and determining  whether it is statistically significant for rejecting the null hypothesis . the software then computes a posterior probability for detecting amino acids responsible for such divergence. taking into account that new functions in paralogous proteins might emerge after gene duplication whenever selective strength is relaxed or whether positive selection is intensified, a second approach was used with the relax method  <cit> . this method allows partitioning a phylogeny into two subsets of branches to determine whether selective strength was relaxed or intensified in one of these subsets  relative to the other . the datamonkey web server was used for this analysis.

RESULTS
msp <dig> chromosomal locus genetic structure in plasmodium spp
whole genome sequences from  <dig> plasmodium species,  <dig> subspecies and  <dig> partial draft genome sequence were screened for describing the msp <dig> chromosomal locus. the msp <dig> locus is circumscribed by pvx_ <dig> and pvx_ <dig> genes in p. vivax  <cit> ; genes sharing high similarity to them were thus searched in the remaining species. since msp <dig> proteins appear be encoded by a single exon  <cit> , the contigs enclosing flanking genes were analysed using orffinder and gene runner software to identify open reading frames  encoding proteins larger than  <dig> amino acids. seventy-nine orfs  in  <dig> genomes having the same transcription orientation were found . these orfs had  <dig>  to  <dig>  kilobases  but p. gallinaceum msp <dig> had a  <dig>  kb length. like previous studies  <cit> , the copy number was different in plasmodium spp. p. vivax and p. cynomolgi had the largest copy number  whilst the lowest copy number was found in p. gallinaceum . shorter fragments  were also found in p. vivax, p. cynomolgi, p. falciparum and p. reichenowi. these orfs  were named in alphabetical order regarding pvx_ <dig> and its homologous genes .

data regarding p. inui, msp7b  was incomplete due to gaps in the contig whilst pcynmsp7j, pcynmsp7l, pcoamspb, preimsp7d and pvinvmsp7a had premature stop codons. however, pcynmsp7l could encode a full msp <dig> protein since it was shown to have intron donor/acceptor sites by genescan  <cit>  screening, as previously shown  <cit> . despite genescan not showing an intron/exon structure for pvinvmsp7a, it has putative donor/acceptor sites . the phobius algorithm was used for determining the presence of signal peptides within orfs and pfam for the msp_7c domain; some genes did not have a signal peptide or the characteristic msp_7c domain in the c-terminal region .table  <dig> in-silico characterisation of putative msp <dig> proteins

the plasmodium msp <dig> family’s phylogenetic relationships
phylogenetic relationships for this family were identified as previously described  <cit> . a multiple alignment was performed for deducing  <dig> msp <dig> genes’ amino acid sequences . a phylogenetic tree was then inferred by using ml and by methods with the jtt + g + f model; both topologies gave similar branch patterns, displaying  <dig> major clades , with clade  <dig> clustering sequences from  <dig> plasmodium species considered in this study, clade  <dig> another  <dig> of them and clade  <dig> clustering the last gene in the chromosomal region from rodent-parasites, p. vivax and p. cynomolgi. the remaining clades put together sequences according to plasmodium lineages . clades  <dig>   <dig>  3a, 3b,  <dig> and 6b only contained orthologous proteins whilst clades 3c and 3d had orthologous and paralogous proteins from monkey-parasite lineage, the clade 6a clustered sequences from hominid-parasite lineage whilst the sequence in clade  <dig> appeared to be exclusive to p. inui. in addition to previous studies  <cit> , the dltrs model was implemented which reconciles the gene tree to the species tree  <cit> . the fraction of sampled values discarded as burn-in during analysis was  <dig>  but the mcmc chain did not converge after more than  <dig> million generations, therefore, gene duplication, loss or transfer rates were not obtained. however, the reconciliation of the msp <dig> gene tree to the plasmodium species tree was obtained. the tree inferred by dltrs had  <dig> major clades , thereby agreeing with the ml and by clades . in all phylogenies  the sequences without the msp_7c domain  appeared to be phylogenetically related to sequences having an msp_7c domain. however, this relationship was only supported by posterior probabilities but not by bootstrapping . furthermore, these sequences, like others not containing an msp_7c domain, had noticeable similarity  with msp <dig> members at the n-terminal end .

since pgalmsp7a is larger than other msp7s, we did not take it into account for the aforementioned analysis; then, only the msp_7c domain was used for inferring their phylogenetic relationships to determine whether pgalmsp7a was orthologous to msp7a/h. the branch pattern from this topology  was similar to the phylogeny obtained by using all sequences . pgalmsp7a clustered with msp7a; however, posterior probability and bootstrapping were low. pgalmsp7a did not cluster with any other msp <dig> in dltrs tree; instead it appeared as an outgroup.

gene conversion amongst msp <dig> genes
an atypical pattern in the clades clustering msp7h/7i and msp7b/7e/7g was observed in the phylogenies inferred above . contrary to what would have been expected, pvivmsp7b was clustered with pvivmsp7e and pvivmsp7g and not with their respective orthologues; likewise, pvivmsp7h and pvivmsp7i seemed to share a common origin. it has previously been reported that gene conversion takes place between pvivmsp7h and 7i  <cit> . we obtained the pvivmsp7s sequences from  <dig> p. vivax isolates to assess whether gene conversion takes place in pvivmsp7b, 7e and 7g. alignments for pvivmsp7c, 7h and 7i and another for pvivmsp7b, 7e and 7g were performed; betran’s method and the geneconv algorithm were then used, displaying recombination tracks between isolates but also between paralogous genes. the betran algorithm found  <dig> conversion tracks between pvivmsp7c and 7i, whilst there were  <dig> conversion tracks between pvivmsp7b and 7e and another two between pvivmsp7e and 7g. figure  <dig> shows the conversion tracks found by geneconv. the same approach was followed for p. falciparum by using different reference isolates. by contrast with p. vivax, pfmsp <dig> members did not seem to be affected by gene conversion since no conversion tracks were found amongst them .fig.  <dig> schematic representations of gene conversion tracks identified by the geneconv method. each gene is represented by a colour bar , pvivmsp7h , pvivmsp7i , pvivmsp7b , pvivmsp7e , and pvivmsp7g ); a different coloured rectangle is a graphical representation of sequence fragments potentially originating from gene conversion. conversion tracks were mainly located in the 3′-ends. the % value refers to the similarity value for the sequence region involved in gene conversion 




episodic positive selection on msp <dig> branches
previous studies have shown ancestral positive selection regarding the msp <dig> gene in the monkey-parasite lineage  <cit> . such episodic positive selection could have occurred in order to adapt to newly-appeared macaque species  <cit> . since msp <dig> and msp <dig> form a protein complex  <cit>  involved in parasite invasion, both proteins should have similar selective pressures. since this has been assessed just for msp7e and 7l  <cit> , the branch-site rel method was used here for assessing whether other lineages are subject to episodic diversifying selection in msp <dig> evolutionary history; evidence was found of strong episodic diversifying selection in a few internal branches and in several external branches . regarding rodent-parasites, the lineages leading to msp7a and 7b in p. vinckei vinckei; p. vinckei petteri, p. chabaudi  and p. berghei  were under selection. just one internal branch  displayed episodic selection. concerning monkey-parasites, a percentage of sites regarding the lineages leading to msp7a in p. vivax, p. cynomolgi and p. inui as well as the p. inui/p. knowlesi/p. coatneyi and p. knowlesi/p. coatneyi lineage ancestors  were under very strong episodic positive selection . likewise, the lineages that gave rise to p. cynomolgi msp7b, 7e, p. vivax msp7b, 7e ; p. inui 7b ; p. vivax 7f ; p. knowlesi 7c, p. cynomolgi 7g, p. inui 7d ; p. coatneyi 7d, p. knowlesi 7d, p. vivax 7h, p. inui 7e, p. cynomolgi 7i  and p. vivax 7l  also were under positive selection. very strong episodic positive selection was observed in the p. knowlesi/p. coatneyi 7c, p. inui 7d/p. vivax 7g, p. coatneyi/p. knowlesi 7d, p. inui 7e/p. cynomolgi 7i/p. vivax 7i and p. cynomolgi/p. vivax msp7i ancestral branches .fig.  <dig> phylogenies analysed for episodic selection. each orthologous cluster was analysed by the branch-site rel method. the shade of each colour on branches indicates strength of selection . the size of each colour represents the percentage of sites in the corresponding class found by branch-site rel. branches have been classified as undergoing episodic diversifying selection by the p-value corrected for multiple testing using the holm-bonferroni method at p <  <dig> . a. clade 1; b. pviv/pcynmsp7b and 7e; c. pviv/pcynmsp7c and pinumsp7b; d. pviv/pcynmsp7f and pinumsp7c; e. pviv/pcynmsp7g, pkno/pcoamsp7c and pinumsp7d; f. pviv/pcynmsp7h/7i, pkno/pcoamsp7d and pinumsp7e; g. clade 2; h. pviv/pcynmsp7l and pinumsp7h and i. clade  <dig>  at the bottom of each phylogeny there is a scale representation of msp7s. the blue boxes represent the encoded n-terminal region, the light brown ones symbolise the central region and the purple boxes the msp_7c domain. numbers within boxes represent the number of codons under positive selection inferred by meme, slac, fel, rel and fubar methods using the datamonkey web server




evolutionary analysis for testing functional divergence
gu’s type-i functional divergence and relax methods were used to identify functional divergence amongst msp <dig> proteins. pairwise comparisons between paralogous proteins  as well as between orthologues , showed high coefficient of divergence  values ; between  <dig> and 20% of the sites had a significant change in their evolutionary rate . likewise, we found either a relaxed selection or an intensified selection amongst msp <dig> paralogues .table  <dig>

the coefficients of divergence  and their lrt values from pairwise cluster comparisons in the msp <dig> multigene family. lrtθd is the  score for the likelihood ratio test against the null hypothesis   <cit> . it is the output of diverge and it follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom; thus, values greater than or equal to  <dig>   indicate functional divergence between pairwise clusters. selection intensity  found by the relax method is shown for paralogous pairwise comparisons . comparisons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> revealed fewer positive selected sites on test branches than on reference branches as well as an intensification of negative selected sites and non-significant θd. comparisons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> revealed an increased proportion of positive selected sites on the test branches, having an intensification of this kind of selection, while the proportion of negative selected sites stayed the same or decreased. the θd values were statistically significant. comparisons  <dig> and  <dig> gave a statistically significant θd and relaxed selection . np: analysis was not performed because proteins came from different species




discussion
it has been suggested that dna duplication is the main source of evolutionary innovation  <cit>  since duplicate dna fragments might evolve to new functions. however, acquiring new functions  is not always the duplicate’s outcome  <cit> . there are other fates for paralogous fragments such as non-functionalisation , subfunctionalisation  <cit>  or even functional redundancy. encoded-protein gene duplication in parasitic organisms involved in host recognition could provide an advantage, regardless of whether such duplicates increase host recognition ability. plasmodium genomes have a lot of genes as multigene families , some of them are functionally equivalent whilst others have functionally diverged  .

the msp <dig> family has been previously described in eight species  <cit> , displaying different expansion. the present study has analysed  <dig> new species and completed analysis for p. reichenowi. an unequal copy gene number was found in plasmodium species, suggesting lineage or specie-specific duplications or deletions. we also found genes which have become pseudogenes, thereby confirming the birth-and-death model of evolution for this family . then again, phylogenetic analysis was used for establishing phylogenetic relationships amongst msp <dig> paralogues. according to the phylogenetic trees , msp7a/h  was the most ancestral gene, followed by clade  <dig> which is shared by monkey- and rodent-parasites. clade  <dig> was also an old clade since it is shared amongst monkey- and rodent-parasites; however, not all monkey-parasites had this copy and it thus became lost in p. knowlesi, p. coatneyi and p. inui. moreover, these proteins in monkey- and rodent-parasites did not have the msp_7c domain. the remaining clades were clustered in agreement with plasmodium species’ relationships  and they were syntenic, suggesting they are orthologues. these expansions reproduced the genus phylogenetic relationships. species belonging to monkey-parasite lineage had the highest copy number. p. vivax and p. cynomolgi  shared the whole msp <dig> repertory. p. inui is the phylogenetically closest species to the aforementioned ones, having  <dig> orthologues followed by p. knowlesi and p. coatneyi having  <dig> orthologues. the latter species are sister taxa sharing a common ancestor as well as the whole msp <dig> repertory. the monkey-parasite lineage is a sister taxon to rodent-parasite lineage. at least two orthologous genes were found within these two lineages whilst only one gene was shared between these and the hominid-parasite lineage . the most ancient plasmodium lineage is the bird/reptile-parasite. we analysed p. gallinaceum and found just one large msp <dig> gene. according to the msp <dig> c-terminal phylogenetic tree , it is still unclear whether this large gene is orthologous to the most ancestral gene . as we did not find any more msp <dig> genes in the p. gallinaceum partial genome, gene expansion should have taken place after mammal-parasite radiation  <dig> million year ago  <cit> .

we found  <dig> sequences between bordering genes in the  <dig> genomes ; however,  <dig> protein sequences did not have the msp_7c domain at the c-terminal end, though some of them did cluster with msp <dig> proteins . proteins lacking such domain had high similarity with msp7s at the n-terminal end . this suggested that proteins lacking an msp_7c domain  are incomplete duplicates or have lost the domain throughout plasmodium evolutionary history.

on the other hand, groups clustering paralogous proteins  displayed an unusual pattern . proteins such as pviv/pcynmsp7e and pviv/pcynmsp7b seemed to be more similar within species than between species. a similar branch pattern was observed in the msp_7c phylogenetic tree , where pvivmsp7b was more similar to pvivmsp7e than pcynmsp7b. likewise, pvivmsp7h was more similar to pvivmsp7i whilst pcynmsp7h clustered together with pcynmsp7i. a previous study has shown that gene conversion takes place in pvivmsp7h and 7i genes  <cit> ; such branching pattern is therefore a consequence of gene conversion. we also observed gene conversion tracks amongst p. vivax reference isolates in the aforementioned genes, suggesting that this mechanism also occurs in pvivmsp7b, 7e and 7g; however, such genes are not near each other  and there was no complete gene homogenisation. therefore, it is not clear whether this mechanism is taking place at present or they are ancient gene conversion events.

parasite invasion involves several protein-protein interactions between parasite and host. msp <dig> is the protein mediating initial interaction, this protein and msp <dig> form a complex involved in parasite-host interaction  <cit> . msp <dig> has shown an episodic positive selection signal throughout its evolutionary history  <cit> ; such positive selection is shown at ancestral branches and is likely the result of adapting to newly-appeared macaque species  <dig> – <dig>  million years ago  <cit>  or during human switching  <cit> . since msp <dig> is in a complex with msp <dig>  <cit> , the former should have similar selective pressures and therefore similar behaviour. we have found several lineages under strong diversifying selection . as in msp <dig>  <cit> , few internal branches were under episodic selection ; this pattern could be the outcome of adaptation to new hosts during plasmodium sympatric speciation, as has been suggested for other antigens  <cit> . on the other hand, several external lineages  were under selection. this could be the outcome of changes in evolutionary rates throughout msp <dig> paralogous evolution which have been favoured by selection since they may have promoted adaptation to a new host or acquiring new molecular activities.

previous work did not recognise codons under positive selection  <cit> ; however, here we identified codons under selection by using improved and/or newly developed methods . the greatest amount of codons under positive selection was located in central msp <dig> regions and a few at 5′ or 3′-ends. population genetics studies have shown the central region to be the most polymorphic and it seems to be involved in immune evasion  <cit> . the positive selected sites found amongst species in central regions could thus be the consequence of host adaptation to avoid host immune responses. on the other hand, positive selected sites at the encoding c-terminal region could be the outcome of coevolution between host receptor and parasite msp <dig> ligands and also the result of the acquisition of new roles .

despite functional redundancy having been suggested for the msp <dig> family  <cit> , some groups have shown that msp <dig> proteins appear not to bind to the same host receptor  <cit> . likewise, some pvivmsp <dig> proteins seem to be forming different protein complexes in the parasite  which might allow different parasite-host interactions. we could not find evidence of functional divergence in msp <dig> paralogues when comparing different clades  in a previous in silico study  <cit> . this could have been because orthologous proteins might use different regions to interact with a host or with their own parasite proteins. the p. falciparum  msp <dig> region involved in host recognition is the 19 kda fragment  <cit> ; nevertheless, the 33 kda fragment in p. vivax  facilitates parasite-host interaction  <cit> . therefore, even though they are orthologous, both proteins have differences in their evolutionary rates within functional regions  <cit> . whether this behaviour also took place in msp <dig>  diverge gave false negatives regarding functional divergence. we thus analysed msp <dig> proteins from other plasmodium species to assess functional divergence amongst msp <dig> clades  but also within clades . unlike a previous study  <cit> , just the msp <dig> c-terminal region was analysed here, taking into account that this region has the domain  defining members of this family, it is the only msp <dig> region in the protein complex  <cit> , in p. vivax msp7s c-terminal regions are highly conserved and under negative selection whilst other regions are highly polymorphic  and most regions binding to red blood cells are in the msp <dig> c-terminal region  <cit> . we have found changes in evolutionary rates amongst paralogous proteins in this region. the coefficients of divergence  were statistically significantly larger than  <dig> between some clades , suggesting that some msp7s have diverged functionally. such divergence could mean that different msp <dig> proteins could form different parasite protein complexes or that mps7s could interact with different host receptors. we also found changes in evolutionary rates within clades  leading to large θd values . this could have been due to functional divergence or different protein regions carrying out the function .

it has been demonstrated that duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history  <cit> . this relaxation could have led to pseudogenisation or, rarely, evolving to new functions  <cit> . moreover, positive selection in duplicates could also lead to them acquiring new molecular activities  <cit> ; relaxed selection or intensification of positive selection must thus be identified in msp7s having functional divergence. our diverge results were consistent with relax results . proteins showing functional divergence also displayed functional constraint relaxation or intensification of positive selection. however, some clades having high θd did not show relaxation or intensification. this could have been due to episodic positive selection. this kind of selection acts very quickly and involves a switch from negative selection to positive selection and back to negative selection  <cit> . episodic selection was found in all msp <dig> paralogous clusters by two different approaches ; consequently, episodic positive selection allowing functional divergence could not have been detected by relax.

on the other hand, some paralogous proteins had no statistical θd values; they also displayed intensification of negative selection, thereby suggesting that they are functionally equivalent. furthermore, functional redundancy in msp7h, 7i and/or 7b and 7e could be favoured by gene conversion; some msp <dig> members could therefore evolve by “partial gene conversion” affecting some but not all msp <dig> paralogous proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the msp <dig> family in different plasmodium species, using different phylogenetic and molecular evolution analyses. although msp <dig> evolved mainly in line with a birth-and-death evolutionary model, some members have evolved in a concerted way. gene conversion has taken place between some paralogous genes allowing gene sequence homogenisation, these paralogous genes consequently keeping the same function. however, some gene conversion tracks could be ancient and thus the homogenisation has been lost. in addition, some paralogous proteins did not show changes in their evolutionary rates; thus, msp7a, 7b, 7c, 7e, 7h and 7i in monkey-parasites seem to be functionally equivalent copies. other msp <dig> members showed alteration in their evolutionary rate as well as relaxed or intensified  selection; functional divergence may thus have occurred in them. such functional divergence could enable msp7f, 7g, 7k and 7l  and msp7a, 7b and 7c  to form different parasite protein complexes and/or recognise different host receptors during invasion. in fact, protein-protein assays have shown that pvivmsp7a interacts with pvivtrag <dig>   <cit>  whilst pvivmsp7l has been found forming a complex with a member of the msp <dig> family  <cit> . moreover, pvivmsp7g  is able to bind to human p-selectin whilst pbermsp7c binds better to mouse p-selectin than pbermsp7a  <cit> . the results described here highlight this family’s importance in the plasmodium genus. further functional assays should be performed based on these results to gain a deeper understanding of the biology of plasmodium invasion.

msp <dig> gene family phylogeny inferred by the maximum likelihood method. numbers represent different clades  whilst numbers on branches are bootstrap and posterior probability values. thirteen major clades were identified on the tree; however, clades  <dig> and  <dig> were not clearly supported by bootstrap values. proteins were clustered in agreement with parasite phylogenetic relationships, clades  <dig>  and  <dig>  being the most ancestral ones; clade  <dig> could also be an old cluster. the clades clustering genes from monkey-parasite lineage are depicted in green, proteins from rodent-parasite lineage in blue and hominid-parasite lineage in grey. the protein cluster in brown is a p. inui specie-specific duplicate. both ml and by trees showed similar topologies, but only the ml tree is shown. some internal branches were inconsistent between by and ml trees. since msp <dig> family has a complex evolutionary history  the tree inference is affected. however, external branches were consistent in both topologies as well as in fig 2’s tree. in by analysis, the settings for prior and likelihood were: prset aamodel = fixed ; prset statefreqpr = fixed ; lset rates = gamma . more than  <dig> million generations were required for reaching an asdsf value lower than  <dig> . the psrf parameter was also used for monitoring convergence . 


additional file 4: similarity values in the n-terminal region between msp <dig> proteins and sequences lacking an msp_7c domain. 


additional file 5: phylogenetic tree inferred with the c-terminal  domain. mammal-parasite msp <dig> sequences containing the msp_7c domain and the pgalmsp <dig> c-terminal domain were aligned and phylogenetic trees were then inferred. pgalmsp <dig> clustered with the most ancestral msp <dig> protein  though this group was not supported by bootstrap and/or posterior probability. the remaining sequences clustered according to host-parasite lineages. numbers on branches show bootstrap and posterior probabilities values. clades shown in red and yellow were the most ancestral ones. the clades clustering genes from monkey-parasite lineage are depicted in green, proteins from rodent-parasite lineage in blue and hominid-parasite lineage in grey. both ml and by trees showed similar topologies but only the ml tree is shown. numbers outside the clades represent the number of clades in fig.  <dig> from the main text. 


additional file 6: episodic positive selection on msp <dig> branches. ω + values reflect the maximum likelihood estimate rate of positive selection. p-value obtained after holm-bonferroni multiple testing correction. the branch-site rel method was performed by hyphy software using both amino acid and dna phylogenies. the datamonkey web server was also used for calculating this method. the number of sites under episodic positive selection was identified by meme using datamonkey. the letters in the first panel correspond to the letters in fig.  <dig> from the main text. 


additional file 7: putative sites involved in functional divergence. diverge computed a posterior probability for detecting putative amino acids responsible for functional divergence in pairwise comparisons having statistical significant θd values. such putative sites were highlighted in green and sites in the c-terminal region  under positive selection found by the meme method were tagged with a red plus symbol . since functional divergence could involve relaxation of functional constraint or could be due to positive selection, a perfect correlation between putative amino acids responsible for divergence and positive selection would not have been expected. positive selection might be involved in the acquisition of a new role but could also be the outcome of adaptation to a new host during plasmodium’s evolutionary history. positive selected sites were inferred using the clade  but not using the sequences from the comparison . 


additional file 8: selection intensity  throughout msp <dig> paralogous genes using the partitioned descriptive model. three ω parameters  and the relative proportion of sites are plotted for test  and reference  branches. the grey vertical dashed line at ω =  <dig> represents neutral evolution. the numbers in parenthesis indicate the comparison number in table  <dig> from the main text. comparisons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show that the percentage of positive selected sites decreased on test branches; they also showed an intensification of negative selected sites , having non-significant θd. these results suggested functional redundancy. comparisons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> displayed an increased percentage of positive selected sites having an intensification of this kind of selection on the test branches whilst the percentage of negative selected sites remained equivalent or decreased. the θd values in these comparisons were statistically significant, suggesting functional divergence. comparison  <dig> showed a statistically significant θd and relaxed selection, indicating functional divergence.
