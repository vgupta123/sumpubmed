BACKGROUND
many metabolites are prone to spontaneous and enzymatic side-reactions that form damaged compounds – a phenomenon known as metabolite damage  <cit> . damaged metabolites are often unusable and may become toxic if they accumulate, so they must be dealt with  <cit> . two common solutions are  to repair the damaged metabolite by reconverting it to its original form  <cit> , or  to pre-empt damage by converting a potentially harmful compound into a benign one before damage occurs  <cit> . cells may also simply excrete damage products  <cit> .

certain members of the diverse and widely distributed yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family were recently shown to pre-empt metabolite damage by deaminating reactive intermediates of the branched-chain amino acid  biosynthesis pathway, and were accordingly named rida . specifically, the isoleucine biosynthesis enzyme threonine dehydratase produces enamines that tautomerize to imines , and rida proteins catalyze hydrolysis of the imines to 2-oxoacids   <cit> . in bacteria and plants, the serine-derived enamine 2-aminoacrylate  can attack the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate  cofactor of branched-chain aminotransferase, which inactivates this enzyme and perturbs bcaa synthesis; rida proteins forestall this damage by hydrolyzing the corresponding imine 2-iminopropanoate   <cit> . 2aa could in principle attack any plp-enzyme, and has been shown to inactivate alanine racemase  <cit> , serine hydroxymethyltransferase  <cit> , and aspartate aminotransferase  <cit> , so that the protective effects of rida likely extend beyond bcaa biosynthesis.

a few other disparate activities have been assigned to yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family members. these include in vitro molecular chaperone activity for drosophila melanogaster duk <dig>  <cit> , endoribonuclease activity for rat l-psp  <cit> , and specialist chorismatase  <cit>  and 2-aminomuconate deaminase  <cit>  activities in bacterial aromatic metabolism.

there is good reason to think that yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family proteins have other – and widespread – roles in metabolic processes. the family occurs in nearly every organism in all domains of life, and some species encode multiple members. salmonella enterica, for instance, has three yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family genes, and streptomyces coelicolor has eleven. although yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> proteins or domains are uniformly small , their sequences are diverse and some members share <8% sequence identity  <cit> . the phylogenetic distribution pattern and sequence diversity strongly imply multiple roles, and several have been suggested in pyrimidine degradation  <cit> , mitochondrial maintenance  <cit> , and metabolic regulation  <cit> .

to explore additional functional roles, we made phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses of the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family. this work enabled prediction of two novel roles for rida proteins, for which experimental support was obtained by biochemical, genetic, and metabolomic approaches.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis and nomenclature of the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family
yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family proteins are split into eight subfamilies in the ncbi conserved domain database , which uses a position-specific scoring matrix to determine conserved domain footprints that imply potential functional sites  <cit> . each subfamily could accordingly have distinct functional activities. we henceforth refer to the whole family as the rid family, to the subfamily containing the characterized rida proteins as the rida subfamily, and to the other seven subfamilies as rid <dig> through rid <dig> . this nomenclature meshes with that used in previous studies  <cit> . a subset of rida proteins  has three rida domains fused in tandem . as rid proteins typically assemble into trimers  <cit>   the 3x-rida proteins are presumably covalently linked trimer units. other arrangements such as fusions of two or four rid domains occur, but are rare and so were excluded from this study.table  <dig>

crystal structures and mutagenesis studies have identified functionally important residues in the rida subfamily. the highly conserved arg <dig> forms salt bridges with the carboxylate oxygens of benzoate in human hp <dig>   <cit>  and the corresponding arg <dig> hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate oxygens of serine, threonine, and 2-oxobutanoate in escherichia coli tdcf   <cit>  . changing this arginine to alanine almost completely abolished imine-hydrolyzing activity in plant and s. enterica rida proteins  <cit> . it has been suggested that conserved tyr <dig> and glu <dig> residues of e. coli tdcf also play a role in substrate binding and positioning of a water molecule used for imine hydrolysis, but replacing the corresponding residues with alanine had little effect on the activity of s. enterica rida  <cit> .

we analyzed residue conservation for all the rid family proteins listed in the ncbi conserved domain database, paying particular attention to the predicted active site residues . the rid <dig>  rid <dig>  and rid <dig> subfamilies retain the conserved arginine and glutamate residues found in rida. the rid <dig>  rid <dig>  rid <dig>  and rid <dig> subfamilies have the glutamate residue but the arginine residue is replaced by tryptophan in rid <dig> and rid <dig>  and is variable in rid <dig> and rid <dig>  the tyrosine is conserved, or conservatively replaced by phenylalanine, in all subfamilies except rid <dig> where it is replaced by isoleucine and rid <dig> where it is variable. the presence or absence of the critical arginine residue thus separates rid subfamilies into two groups:  subfamilies rida and rid1-rid <dig> that have this residue and are predicted to hydrolyze imines, and  subfamilies rid4-rid <dig> that lack it and presumably serve other functions. finally, it should be noted that a small minority  of rida proteins have a serine residue instead of arginine, suggesting there may be functional diversity even within the rida subfamily .

to assess their phylogenetic distribution, we mapped rid family members onto a phylogenetic tree containing almost  <dig> sequenced organisms representing all three domains of life  <cit>  . this mapping showed that the rida subfamily is widely distributed among all domains of life whereas the other seven subfamilies occur primarily in bacteria, especially proteobacteria. this pattern suggests that the rida subfamily is archetypal and gave rise to the other subfamilies. we also mapped genome size onto the phylogenetic tree and found that it correlated positively  with the number of rid genes per genome . similar correlations have been observed for other large gene families  <cit> .figure  <dig>

comparative genomic analysis of the rid family
we used comparative genomic analysis to explore the possibility that rid family proteins have functions besides hydrolysis of threonine dehydratase-derived imines, as suggested by their sequence diversity and phylogenetic distribution. the analysis was made on a representative set of  <dig> prokaryotic genomes   using the seed database and its tools, which enable ready detection of gene clustering patterns  <cit> . gene clustering in prokaryotes strongly implies a functional relationship, particularly when clusters occur in more than one configuration and in diverse organisms  <cit> . full results of the analysis are available at the seed database .

because rida can pre-empt damage to various plp-dependent enzymes by hydrolyzing the reaction products of threonine dehydratase, we expected clustering between the corresponding genes. indeed, rida genes were found to cluster consistently with threonine dehydratase genes in bacteria and archaea . aspartate aminotransferase, which is prone to damage by 2aa , also clusters with rid genes in diverse bacteria – usually with rida and less often with rid <dig> . l-cysteine desulfurase and d-cysteine desulfhydrase likewise cluster in diverse bacteria with rida, or sometimes rid <dig> . like threonine dehydratase, these enzymes can form the damaging intermediate 2aa  <cit> . rida, rid <dig>  or rid <dig> genes also cluster with the plp enzymes cystathionine β-lyase and tryptophanase, both of which can produce 2aa  <cit>  . the above instances of clustering, while expected, clearly confirm that gene clustering patterns can reflect rid gene function.figure  <dig>

we were therefore intrigued to find two additional clustering patterns in bacteria. first, rida or sometimes rid <dig> genes frequently cluster with fad-dependent amine oxidase family genes . as fad-dependent amine oxidases produce an imine intermediate that spontaneously hydrolyzes to a 2-oxoacid  <cit>  it is possible that rida and rid <dig> accelerate the hydrolysis of these imines, as rida does for imines produced by threonine dehydratase. second, rida and occasionally other rid genes cluster with genes of arginine or pyrimidine metabolism . about 80% of clustering occurred with rida genes; rid <dig> genes were the next most common but >70% of these occurred in a cluster that also contained rida.figure  <dig>

rid family genes cluster on bacterial chromosomes with pyrimidine and arginine metabolism genes, particularly those related to carbamoyl phosphate.  the layout is the same as in figure  <dig>   the metabolic pathways of pyrimidine and arginine synthesis  and breakdown  are shown. dark blue bars under each enzyme indicate the relative proportion of genomes  in which each gene of pyrimidine or arginine metabolism is clustered on the chromosome with a rid family gene. the longest bar  corresponds to  <dig> instances of clustering.



to home in on functional associations, we mapped the frequency with which rid genes cluster with individual arginine and pyrimidine metabolism genes. this analysis showed that clustering centered on genes for carbamoyl phosphate-related enzymes, none of which have a plp cofactor or are known to form enamines or imines . this association suggests a novel role for rid proteins in carbamoyl phosphate metabolism.

rida hydrolyzes reactive imines produced by amino acid oxidases
to assess the ability of rid family proteins to hydrolyze imines produced by fad-dependent amine oxidases we used an assay based on the ability of imines to react rapidly with semicarbazide to produce semicarbazones, which absorb in the uv range  <cit> . the competition between semicarbazone formation and rid-mediated hydrolysis of the enzymatically produced imines can thus be monitored spectrophotometrically. we chose to assay the three rid proteins of s. enterica because s. enterica rida is well studied and so can serve as a benchmark for imine-hydrolyzing activity, and because s. enterica rid <dig>  has the catalytically important arginine residue and s. enterica rid <dig>  does not.

purified l-amino acid oxidase  from crotalus adamanteus venom was used as a model fad-dependent amine oxidase because it has been used previously in assays containing semicarbazide  <cit> . recombinant s. enterica rida, rid <dig>  and rid <dig> were purified to near-homogeneity by ni2+-affinity chromatography . rapid semicarbazone formation was observed when lox was incubated with leucine and semicarbazide . addition of 10 μm rida, rid <dig>  or rid <dig> caused a 93%, 46%, or <3% decrease in the rate of semicarbazone formation, respectively . to better assess the ability of the three s. enterica proteins to hydrolyze the leucine-derived imine, we varied the concentrations of the rid proteins included in the assay. rida was the most active, reducing the rate of semicarbazone formation by 50% at less than 1 μm compared to about 10 μm for rid <dig> . rid <dig> did not significantly reduce semicarbazone formation even at 100 μm, showing that it cannot hydrolyze the leucine-derived imine .figure  <dig>

we then tested the ability of the s. enterica proteins to hydrolyze other amino acid-derived imines. first, the rate of semicarbazone formation was determined in assays containing lox and various amino acid substrates without rid proteins . amino acids with polar and charged side groups proved to be very poor substrates, and thus non-charged methionine, phenylalanine, and glutamine were chosen to test further. the amount of lox in the assay was adjusted so that the rate of semicarbazone formation was the same for each amino acid substrate, thus allowing direct comparison of imine-hydrolyzing capabilities. at 10 μm, rid <dig> did not significantly reduce semicarbazone formation for any amino acid tested, indicating that it cannot hydrolyze any of the amino acid-derived imines . rida hydrolyzed the methionine-derived imine nearly as effectively as the leucine-derived imine, reducing the rate of semicarbazone formation by 91% compared to 93%, and was only slightly less effective  in hydrolyzing the glutamine-derived imine . rid <dig> hydrolyzed the glutamine- and leucine-derived imines at similar rates , and hydrolysed the methionine-derived imine more slowly . rida and rid <dig> also hydrolyzed the phenylalanine-derived imine, although relatively slowly, reducing semicarbazone formation by 35% and 12%, respectively. these results show that rida and to a lesser extent rid <dig>  but not rid <dig>  can hydrolyze several imino acids and that rida and rid <dig> differ in substrate preference.

genetic evidence supports a rida-carbamoyl phosphate connection
to explore the functional connection between rid proteins and carbamoyl phosphate predicted by comparative genomics, we engineered s. enterica to accumulate carbamoyl phosphate, and ablated genes encoding each of the three rid family proteins. s. enterica is particularly appropriate for this experiment because its rida gene clusters with the arginine metabolic genes encoding ornithine carbamoyltransferase and arg deiminase, the regulatory gene argr, the pyrimidine metabolic gene encoding asp carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase, suggesting that s. enterica rida plays a role in carbamoyl phosphate metabolism. the arginine biosynthesis pathway was blocked by disrupting the gene encoding ornithine carbamoyltransferase , and an expression plasmid containing the gene encoding the carb subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase  was introduced. this subunit is sufficient to produce carbamoyl phosphate provided that the medium contains ammonium  <cit> . the plasmid used  was isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible  <cit> . we reasoned that an iptg-inducible growth defect in strains lacking a rid family member would confirm a role for this rid protein in carbamoyl phosphate metabolism.

we compared the growth of the control strain containing all three native rid genes with strains lacking rida, rid <dig>  or rid <dig>  all strains grew similarly in nutrient broth at 37°c in the absence of iptg . when iptg was included, growth of the control strain, and strains lacking rid <dig> or rid <dig>  was indistinguishable from that in medium without iptg but the strain lacking rida had a substantial growth defect . these results indicate that accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate is detrimental to s. enterica cells lacking a functional rida protein, and thus point to a role for rida in controlling damaged caused directly or indirectly by carbamoyl phosphate.figure  <dig>

metabolomic analysis indicates division of labor among s. enterica rid proteins
two different analytical techniques, lc-ms and gc-ms, were used to explore the metabolic consequences deleting rid family genes. wild type and triple  knockout s. enterica cells were first profiled using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry  platform to favor detection of highly polar compounds. samples were collected as they entered late log phase; this harvesting point was selected to maximize the difference between wild-type and triple knockout cells . only two metabolites showed significant  accumulations of ≥ <dig> -fold in knockout cells. of these, the larger accumulation  was of dihydroorotate, a pyrimidine synthesis intermediate located one step downstream of the carbamoyl phosphate-dependent step in the pathway . the smaller accumulation  was of 4-aminobutyrate, a general stress metabolite. the specificity and size of the dihydroorotate pool size change suggest a role for the rid family in pyrimidine synthesis, possibly in countering an adverse effect of carbamoyl phosphate  on dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.figure  <dig>

rid knockouts reveals widespread metabolic disturbances. wild-type s. enterica and triple rid ko , and for gc-ms also single rida ko , cultures were grown, harvested, and analyzed as described in methods.  hilic-tof-ms identified dihydoorotate as having a significant  <dig> -fold change in the triple ko. part of the pyrimidine metabolic pathway is shown  with bars indicating the relative amount of dihydroorotate in each sample.  venn diagrams summarize the significant  -fold changes  for gc-tof-ms identified and unknown peaks.  gc-tof-ms identified compounds with significant -fold changes found in one or both knockouts are listed in order of -fold change  or single  rid ko is indicated) and colored yellow or green to indicate increased or decreased levels in the knockout, respectively. p-values are shown to the left of -fold changes. colored bars adjacent to compound names mark intermediates of metabolic pathways shown in the legend. data represent six  or twelve  independent cultures for each treatment.



the more general metabolic impact of ablating rid family members was surveyed using a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry  metabolomics platform. we compared single rida and triple rida rid <dig> rid <dig> knockout strains with wild-type s. enterica. in total,  <dig> compounds were detected in all three strains, of which  <dig> were positively identified. we then calculated the relative -fold change for each compound between the mutant strains and wild-type. about 22% of compounds in the single rida knockout had significant  -fold changes , while ~31% of compounds in the triple knockout showed significant -fold changes  . besides confirming that rid <dig> and rid <dig> cannot replace rida, these data suggest that rid <dig> and rid <dig> have roles of their own, i.e. that there is division of labor among s. enterica rid proteins. there was much overlap in the profiles of the two knockout strains; 78% of the compounds that changed significantly in the single knockout also did so in the triple knockout . furthermore, the changes in overlapping compounds were always in the same direction , and were generally of similar magnitude .

the compounds showing significant -fold changes came from diverse sectors of metabolism. one sector was sulfur metabolism; cysteine showed the largest change of any identified compound – almost 14-fold in the triple knockout . a second sector was bcaa metabolism; isoleucine and leucine changed in both knockouts, as did other bcaa pathway metabolites . several compounds involved in arginine, proline, and pyrimidine metabolism changed, possibly due to a lesion in carbamoyl phosphate metabolism . purine-related metabolites were also affected, as were various sugars and sugar derivatives .

discussion
separating the rid family into subfamilies, and analyzing patterns of residue conservation and chromosomal clustering in these subfamilies, led to one finding that was broadly predictable from previous work, and two that were not. the broadly predictable finding was that the largest and most widely distributed subfamily, rida, most probably pre-empts damage by hydrolyzing 2ip  that comes from other plp-dependent enzymes besides the known source threonine dehydratase. 2aa is formed in the normal catalytic or side-reactions of l-cysteine desulfurase  <cit>  and d-cysteine desulfhydrase  <cit> , cystathionine beta-lyase  <cit> , and tryptophanase  <cit> , with each of which rida clusters .

the first novel finding was that the rida subfamily, the rid <dig> subfamily, and probably the rid <dig> and rid <dig> subfamilies, which all retain the arginine residue shown to be essential for 2ip hydrolysis  <cit> , can hydrolyze imines produced by fad-dependent amine oxidases. this finding extends the known imine-hydrolyzing function of rid proteins to a wider range of imines that are formed by enzymes in pathways very different to those involving the imine-forming plp enzymes. the imine compounds formed by amine oxidases could potentially react with, and hence damage, various cellular components  <cit> . thus, the physiological implications are that enamine/imine damage to metabolism is not restricted to that from 2aa/2ip and that, collectively, rid family proteins with the conserved arginine residue could act as wide-spectrum enamine/imine damage-pre-emption enzymes.

the second novel finding was that the rida subfamily, and possibly other rid subfamilies, are closely connected to carbamoyl phosphate metabolism. under physiological conditions, carbamoyl phosphate breaks down spontaneously and rapidly  to phosphate and isocyanate, which tautomerizes to cyanate  <cit> . isocyanate is a potent damage agent because it reacts readily with amino, thiol, carboxyl, and other groups, and so carbamoylates amino acids, proteins and other molecules  <cit> . because isocyanate and carbamoyl groups have some similarity to imines, and rida proteins have imine hydrolase activity, it is reasonable to infer that this subfamily can pre-empt carbamoylation damage in an analogous way to its action in pre-empting imine damage. in this connection, it may be noted that a simple possibility – that rida proteins hydrolyze carbamoyl phosphate or isocyanate to release ammonia – was not supported by pilot experiments with s. enterica rida . another possibility is that rid proteins protect a carbamoyl phosphate-related enzyme or metabolite from damage caused by 2aa or another enamine/imine-containing compound.

CONCLUSIONS
the rid protein family comprises a large, widely distributed – and probably archetypal – subfamily  and seven smaller subfamilies  found mainly in bacteria. the rida through rid <dig> subfamilies share a catalytically critical arginine residue and apparently serve to hydrolyze the reactive imines generated by plp-dependent enzymes or fad-dependent amine oxidases, thereby pre-empting the damage these imines would otherwise cause. the rida subfamily most probably has an additional damage-pre-emption role in carbamoyl phosphate metabolism that has yet to be biochemically defined.

the biochemical activities and physiological functions of the rid <dig> through rid <dig> subfamilies remain completely unknown. thus far it is clear that these four subfamilies are most likely not imine hydrolases since they lack the arginine residue on which imine hydrolase activity depends, and because no imine hydrolase activity was detected for s. enterica rid <dig>  and although the rid <dig> through rid <dig> subfamilies are predicted – and in the case of s. enterica rid <dig>  demonstrated – to have imine hydrolase activity in vitro, nothing is known about the in vivo substrates for these three subfamilies.

in sum, the rid family as a whole still has only a few known functions, and additional functions surely remain to be discovered. it is nonetheless clear that rida proteins are iconic examples of the emerging principle of metabolite damage pre-emption  <cit> ; the same seems likely to prove true of proteins from other rid subfamilies.
