BACKGROUND
indigenous rangifer migrated to alaska more than  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , and have been separated from siberian reindeer since the disappearance of the bering land bridge  <dig> years ago. semi-domesticated reindeer  were introduced to alaska in  <dig> when  <dig> siberian reindeer were introduced to unalaska and amaknak islands  <cit> . over the next  <dig> years, a total of  <dig>  reindeer were imported to western alaska  <cit> . reindeer numbers in alaska peaked in the 1930's with a population estimate of about  <dig>  animals  <cit> . under current management, reindeer herds range freely on large designated grazing allotments and are periodically herded into handling facilities for ear tagging, censusing, husbandry and veterinary care  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years, the herds have drastically declined in size and many herds have completely disappeared. most of alaska's remaining  <dig>  reindeer are now found on the seward peninsula and nunivak, st lawrence and umnak islands  <cit> .

there are a variety of possible reasons for this population's decline including commingling and emigration into the migratory western arctic caribou herd  and increasing predation by wolves. the wah is the largest caribou herd in alaska, with a population of  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> . since  <dig>  this herd has expanded their seasonal migratory routes to include the range of alaskan reindeer on the eastern half of seward peninsula where caribou had been absent for over  <dig> years  <cit> . many reindeer have out-migrated with the caribou during spring migrations, reducing reindeer numbers. although alphaherpesviruses were previously shown to be endemic in alaskan caribou  <cit> , it was unknown which virus was present, if this virus was introduced to alaska with reindeer from either siberia or norway and if cross-transmission occurs between reindeer and caribou in alaska.

members of the subfamily, alphaherpesvirinae  have a broad host range, replicate quickly, lyse infected cells and establish latency in sensory neuron ganglia. in a range of ruminant species, clinical signs may be present in the eyes, respiratory tract, genital organs, and mammary glands. systemic spread can result in abortions and enteritis, usually achieved by invasion of the reticuloendothelial system  <cit> .

alphaherpesviruses antigenically similar to bohv <dig> have been found to be endemic in reindeer in norway  <cit> , sweden  <cit> , and finland  <cit> , as well as in caribou in canada  <cit>  and alaska  <cit> . in finland, a virus isolated in  <dig> was later shown to be genetically different from bohv <dig> and is now called cervid herpesvirus  <dig>   <cit> .

a recent serosurvey, based on a commercial elisa kit for cattle and bohv <dig>  complemented by a virus neutralization test  showed that cvhv <dig> is endemic in norwegian reindeer, with a mean seroprevalence across northern norway of 48%   <cit> . the presence of cvhv <dig> was also confirmed by virus isolation after reactivation of latent infection with dexamethasone in an experimental infection trial  <cit> .

the clinical impact of cvhv <dig> infections in reindeer is unclear. recently, cvhv <dig> was associated with an outbreak of infectious keratoconjunctivitis  in norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer  <cit> . of the sampled animals, clinically affected individuals had a cvhv <dig> seroprevalence of 86% , while the prevalence in unaffected reindeer was 42% . although bacteria including moraxella sp., streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and archanobacterium spp. were also isolated, it was concluded that cvhv <dig> was the primary agent during this outbreak, facilitating secondary bacterial infection. this conclusion was supported by the fact that virus could be isolated from eye swab samples more frequently in animals with a mild stage of the disease, whereas in severe cases of ikc, only bacteria were recovered  <cit> . however, it remains unknown if the ikc frequently reported in alaskan reindeer is related to a herpesvirus infection  <cit> .

cvhv <dig> has been isolated from respiratory and genital swab samples as well as fetal and ocular tissues of reindeer in norway  <cit> . clinical signs of cvhv <dig> seen during an experimental infection study demonstrated that respiratory inoculation leads to moderate fever, slight serous nasal discharge, and minor erosions and erythema in the nasal cavity, while genital inoculation leads to moderate fever, vaginal discharge, and erosions of the vulva  <cit> .

a study in saskatchewan, canada, found 55% of  <dig> woodland caribou  to have antibodies to a virus related to bohv <dig>  <cit> . similar results have also been reported in alaskan reindeer some decades ago  <cit> , indicating that either bohv <dig> or another closely related alphaherpesvirus with similar antigenicity was present. a survey of alaskan caribou found bohv <dig> related antibodies in sera of 6/ <dig>  animals  <cit> .

persistent viral infections such as those caused by cervid herpesviruses may affect calf mortality and fitness, and potentially result in abortions and weak offspring  <cit>  as also reported in bohv <dig> infections in cattle  <cit> .

our objectives were to 1) describe the level of exposure to herpesviruses in alaskan reindeer and caribou and to identify risk factors for exposure, 2) determine which herpesvirus is circulating among alaskan reindeer and caribou and 3) characterize the virus through sequencing of pcr amplicons obtained from nasal and ocular swabs.

RESULTS
reindeer
the overall frequency of seropositivity  for reindeer was 47% , showing no significant difference between years of sampling. two samples having inconclusive results were classified as negative prior to the statistical analysis. adults had a higher likelihood of exposure  than calves , whereas gender and year of sampling were not significantly associated with seroprevalence . the area under the roc curve was acceptable at  <dig> . the lowess curve  presents the age trends in reindeer showing an increase in seroprevalence for older animals.

pcr amplicons of the expected size  were obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> swabs collected from apparently healthy reindeer calves . sequences were found to be identical to the cvhv <dig> salla <dig> strain , except for the davis reindeer sample, which was similar to the norwegian reindeer isolates of cvhv <dig>  <cit> , having one single nucleotide synonymous mutation compared to the salla <dig> strain. sequences submitted to genbank .

from the subpanel of samples chosen for the virus neutralization test , all samples considered negative by elisa were negative for all viruses in the vnt . all samples considered positive by elisa, except one weak positive , were positive for at least one virus in the vnt. all samples classified as positive in the vnt neutralized cvhv <dig> to a higher titer than any other viruses. for reindeer, the highest serum dilution that neutralized cvhv <dig> was 1: <dig> followed by elkhv with 1: <dig>  then cvhv <dig> with 1: <dig> and finally bohv <dig> with 1: <dig> . virus back titrations for the reindeer and caribou neutralizations oscillated between  <dig> and  <dig> tcid <dig>  , a range considered to be narrow enough to compare viruses' neutralizations results.

neutralizing titers were calculated according to the spearman-k√§rber method as the serum dilution necessary to neutralize the cytopathic effect in 50% of the wells  and are presented as the mean values for each virus titration . virus back titrations for the reindeer and caribou neutralizations oscillated between  <dig> and  <dig> tcid <dig>  .

caribou
the overall frequency of seropositivity on elisa for caribou was 60%  with similar levels in mulchatna , teshekpuk , and western arctic . the logistic regression model showed that differences in seroprevalence between genders and herds were not statistically significant . as most animals were calves  it was not possible to assess the effect of age on seroprevalence.

pcr amplicons of the expected size  were obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> buffy coats samples. the amplicon sequences were identical to corresponding sequences of the cvhv <dig> finnish strain . sequences submitted to genbank .

in the vnt for caribou, the highest serum dilution that neutralized cvhv <dig> was 1: <dig> followed by elkhv with 1: <dig> then cvhv <dig> and bohv <dig> both with 1: <dig> .

discussion
the overall frequency of seropositivity of 60% in caribou and 47% in reindeer with no significant change over a time frame of  <dig> years for the latter, together with the fact that herpesviruses undergo latency and life-long infection, strongly indicates that an alphaherpesvirus is endemic in these animal populations. as other alphaherpesviruses cross-react serologically to bohv <dig>  <cit> , vnt and pcr were required to determine which virus was circulating in alaskan reindeer and caribou. while vnt titer differences between the viruses may not be considered as great, all samples neutralized cvhv <dig> to a higher extent than other viruses. likewise, viral dna sequencing showed, in a highly conserved gene such as ul <dig> coding for glycoprotein b, a 99-100% homology to cvhv <dig>  with lower degrees of homology for other ruminant alphaherpesviruses. based on the gb amplicon sequences, widely accepted to be sufficient to differentiate between ruminant alphaherpesviruses  <cit> , we believe the virus circulating in these populations to be cvhv <dig>  however future work in isolation or amplification of other less conserved areas of the genome should be carried out to help understand if the cvhv <dig> in alaska is similar to the strains described in scandinavia. based on the serological prevalence over this time-frame in reindeer, the finding of alphaherpesvirus sequences by pcr, and the knowledge that these viruses establish life-long infections as any other herpesvirus, indicates that an alphaherpesvirus is endemic in the reindeer population and strongly suggests that cvhv <dig> is the agent circulating in alaska. extended sequencing of less conserved areas of the genome than the gb gene might enable us to verify if the cvhv <dig> strain in alaska is indeed similar to scandinavian isolates.

the higher frequency in older animals is consistent with previous studies. in saskatchewan, it was found that the prevalence of herpesvirus antibody titers increased with age, with most seropositive animals being over three years old  <cit> . in norway, the seroprevalence increased with age, weight and reindeer density   <cit> . an increased frequency of seropositives in older animals is likely due to the increased time period that older animals have to become exposed and the age-cohort effect found in any enduring immunity. animals, due to latency of the virus, are infected for life, having reactivations which boost production of antibodies. there was not a sex difference in the frequency of seropositivity even though males would be expected to have more interactions during the breeding season .

the single nucleotide difference between our pcr amplicons sequences and that of the finnish cvhv <dig> strain  is identical to the substitution previously described in isolates obtained from norwegian reindeer  <cit> . this leads to the question of whether the virus was imported with siberian reindeer in the 1890s or if it has been present in the caribou population since they crossed the bering land bridge over  <dig>  years ago. further studies, focusing on historical samples from the wah, is needed to determine if the virus was circulating before the migratory pattern of this herd changed to cause more interaction with reindeer or if the caribou were exposed to the virus during these recent interactions. although serological evidence of an alphaherpesvirus has been found in woodland caribou in canada  <cit> , the species of that virus is unknown and further evaluation is necessary to determine if it is the same virus as in alaskan caribou and reindeer. if it is the same virus, this provides additional evidence that the virus has persisted in north america over several thousand years.

the impact of these viruses on the health of caribou and reindeer in alaska is unknown. in norway, cvhv <dig> has been shown to cause respiratory disease, abortions and keratoconjunctivitis  <cit> . it is, however, unknown if herpesvirus causes the keratoconjunctivitis reported in alaskan reindeer or if the virus is one of many contributing factors in a multifactorial disease process.

further research, including virus isolation from both reindeer and caribou is necessary to determine if the alphaherpesvirus circulating in reindeer and caribou in alaska represent only one virus or strain and if it is indeed identical to the scandinavian cvhv <dig>  studies on siberian reindeer or reindeer imported from siberia, having had less or no contact with caribou, may shed light on the origin of the virus in alaska. alphaherpesvirus infections in reindeer and caribou do not appear to induce high mortality or severe and obvious disease syndromes, but this is difficult to evaluate due to large and fluctuating herd sizes, remote areas and limited access to animals. however, being endemic and establishing latent infections, and having the potential to cause abortion, weak offspring, mucosal lesions as well as playing a part in the etiology of ikc, such infections may have greater impact on reindeer health and fitness than previously thought. this may be especially relevant to stress situations, reactivation of latent infections and shedding and transmission of virus within the herd, i.e. to calves and young animals.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that alaskan reindeer and caribou are infected with an alphaherpesvirus. based on sequence similarity, cvhv- <dig> is the most likely virus. further studies should be conducted to determine the impact of this infection on the health of these animals.
