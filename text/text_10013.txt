BACKGROUND
h. pylori is a highly successful micro-aerophilic spiral-shaped bacterium that has colonized the gastric epithelium of half of the human population  <cit> . h. pylori is a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  lymphoma  <cit> . it was the first bacterial pathogen to be classified as a class i carcinogen by the who. gastric cancer remains the second deadliest cancer worldwide, which makes h. pylori infection, also in light of growing bacterial resistances to antibiotics, a significant global health problem  <cit> .

h. pylori has evolved elaborate mechanisms to manipulate host cells during infection. following colonization of the gastric epithelial apical surface and adhesion, various h. pylori virulence factors interfere with signalling pathways in gastric epithelial cells. the presence of a pathogenicity island  in h. pylori is strongly associated with the development of gastric diseases. the cag pai encodes a t4ss that mediates translocation of bacterial virulence factors into the host cell  <cit> . the three major h. pylori virulence factors involved in bacterial-epithelial interactions that are associated with an increased risk of severe gastritis, gastric atrophy and/or gastric cancer, are the cag pathogenicity island , the vacuolating cytotoxin a , and the blood group antigen-binding adhesiona <dig> , which binds lewis b on gastric epithelial cells  <cit> . caga, one of the main virulence factors of h. pylori, also encoded in the pai, is translocated via the t4ss into the host cell cytoplasm, where it modulates cellular functions. attachment of caga-positive h. pylori induces cell scattering in human gastric epithelial cells  <cit> . cell scattering comprises cell spreading and elongation, and the cells become motile. therefore, cell scattering is one readout for the motogenic response of h. pylori infected cells. recent studies have shown that caga intracellularly modulates the receptor tyrosine kinase c-met  <cit> . binding of the natural ligand hgf to c-met stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis in epithelial cells  <cit> . abnormal c-met signalling has been strongly related to tumour genesis, in particular to the development of invasive and metastatic phenotypes  <cit> . numerous experiments indicate a particular role of hgf and the proto-oncogene c-met in tumour invasive growth  <cit> . it has been shown that c-met signalling induced by h. pylori leads to the activation of erk1/ <dig> in ags cells  <cit> . erk1/ <dig> activity promotes cell scattering in a transcription independent manner. it has also been shown that activation of erk1/ <dig> is critical for the induction of cell scattering in h. pylori-infected epithelial cells  <cit> , which could contribute to the invasiveness of tumour cells. therefore, blocking the activation of erk1/ <dig> represents a promising intervention goal to prevent h. pylori induced signalling changes, which could play a role for cancer metastasis.

the induction of cell scattering by h. pylori in epithelial cells, is an example how human microbial pathogens modulate signal transduction in the cell by translocated bacterial proteins. the presented work aims at translating these complex interactions into a logical network model.

signalling networks have not yet been modelled at a scale comparable to metabolic and regulatory networks. more than  <dig> members of the protein kinase superfamily of enzymes alone are encoded in the human genome, which allows for an enormous complexity of signalling. the wealth of data generated, describing signalling networks in molecular detail at a rapidly increasing rate makes the reconstruction of such large networks a difficult task  <cit> . the most often used formalism to model cellular networks is kinetic analysis, which has been applied to signalling networks of smaller size  <cit>  or for modelling single pathways  <cit> . a large scale reconstruction of signalling networks relying on kinetic data has not yet appeared due to the lack of available kinetic data for the interactions in the network. the data obtained by recent genomics and proteomics high throughput technologies are often only qualitative or semi-quantitative. therefore, qualitative  modelling seems to be the only feasible approach at the moment to represent and analyse large-scale signalling networks in a computer. a functional analysis of the network structure already enables to address important issues, such as detection of network-wide interdependencies, identification of intervention strategies and qualitative predictions on the effect of perturbations.

in our view it would be invalid to try to construct a complete network model of h. pylori infection due to the limited number of detailed information about the cellular processes triggered by this pathogen. thus, in contrast to a h. pylori infection model, we explicitly only considered the signal transduction events that directly arise from c-met-receptor-mediated signalling, which becomes modulated by the h. pylori virulence factor caga.

in order to construct a qualitative network model of c-met activation by hgf and h. pylori we used here a methodology introduced previously  <cit>  relying on logical interaction hypergraphs . our model reveals the differences and commonalities of the response of the network upon hgf and h. pylori induced c-met signalling. another goal of this study was to use the logical model to generate in silico predictions and to verify these experimentally. as one case study demonstrating the predictive capabilities of our model, we determine suitable interventions that prevent an activation of erk1/ <dig>  because of the above mentioned decisive role of erk1/ <dig> for cell scattering and tumour invasive growth.

RESULTS
logical modelling of signal transduction networks
for the reconstruction and qualitative analysis of the signal flow network we employ a logical modelling framework  as introduced previously  <cit> . boolean network modelling for biological systems has so far mainly been applied to the analysis of medium-scale regulatory networks  <cit> . in contrast to regulatory networks , signalling networks are much stronger structured in input, intermediate and output layers and the input signals usually govern the response of the network. for this characteristic network topology we introduced logical interaction hypergraphs   <cit>  as a special representation of boolean networks, which is well suited to formalize, visualize and analyse logical models of signal transduction networks. as in all boolean networks, nodes in the network represent species  each having an associated logical state  or "off" ) determining whether the species is active  or not. signalling events are encoded as boolean operations on the network nodes. for example, protein kinase c alpha  can be activated  if the level of calcium and of diacylglycerol  is high, i.e. calcium and dag must be "on" to activate pkcα . usually, a node can be activated by more than one signalling event, which are then or-connected, e.g. the mapkkk raf <dig> becomes active if either ras or pkcα is active .

in general, in lihs we make only use of the boolean operators and , or , and not , which are sufficient to represent any logical relationship. a signalling event in a lih is an and connection of nodes  describing one opportunity how the target species of this connection can be activated. hence, for the first example described above we would write

dag and ca2+ → pkcα or shorter dag ·ca2+ → pkcα

in a graphical representation of the network , such an and connection is displayed as a hyperarc. in contrast to arcs in graphs, a hyperarc  may have several start or end nodes. clearly, in some cases, only one species is involved in activating another as in the case

ras → raf <dig> 

in these special cases, the hyperarc is a simple arc as occurring in graphs; we will nevertheless refer to it as a hyperarc. as already pointed out, a species may be activated via several distinct signalling events , i.e. all these signalling events are or-connected. this is illustrated by raf <dig>  which can be activated via

ras → raf <dig> or pkcα → raf <dig> 

accordingly, all the hyperarcs pointing into a species are or connected. in this way we can easily interpret figure  <dig>  which displays graphically the interactions given in table  <dig> 

exclamation mark denotes a logical not and dots within the equation indicate and operations.

once we have constructed an lih, we may start to analyse it. a typical scenario is that we apply a pattern of inputs to the network and we would like to know how the nodes in the network will respond to this stimulation. as explained in  <cit> , by propagating input signals along the logical  connections  we obtain the qualitative response of the network. it depends on the functionality of positive or negative feedback loops in the network whether we can resolve a complete and unique logical response of all nodes for a given set of input stimuli . feedback loops are usually present in signalling networks, however, one can often identify at least one connection in each loop that becomes active at a later time-scale and does not play a significant role for the early signalling events. setting these late-event connections inactive, one obtains an acyclic network for which always a unique network response for a given set of inputs can be computed. using this technique, one can easily perform in silico experiments, for example check how knockouts  alter the network response.

with the idea of minimal intervention sets  one may even directly search for those interventions that enforce a desired response . as described by klamt et al.  <cit> , miss can be computed by testing systematically which combinations of knockouts  and knockins  fulfil a specified intervention goal. one usually starts with the single kos and kis: one clamps the logical value  of the respective node, computes the resulting logical steady state  and verifies whether the intervention goal is achieved. all those kos and kis, that were not successful are then combined in pairs which may lead to some miss of size two. then all combinations with  <dig> interventions  are tested and so forth. obviously, especially computing the miss of higher cardinality becomes a highly combinatorial problem and one usually restricts oneself to the low cardinality miss. there are also some heuristics that can be used to accelerate the computation  <cit> .

another advantage of lihs is, that we can easily derive the  interaction graph underlying the logical model: we only have to split hyperarcs with two or more start nodes  into simple arcs. interaction graphs cannot be used to give on/off predictions, however, they provide an appropriate formalism to search for signalling paths and feedback loops. another useful feature that can be extracted from interaction graphs is the dependency matrix as introduced in  <cit>  which displays network-wide interdependencies between all pairs of species. for example, a species a is an activator  of another species b, if at least one path leads from a to b and if all those paths are positive . this kind of information can be very useful for predicting effects of perturbations.

the model studied in this work was implemented in and analysed with cellnetanalyzer, a comprehensive toolbox for functional analysis of cellular networks  <cit> .

logical network of hgf and h. pylori triggered c-met signal transduction
the logical network of hgf and h. pylori induced c-met signal transduction was constructed as a bottom up approach. we restricted our network model explicitly to the signal transduction events that arise from stimulation or modulation of the c-met receptor. other virulence factors of h. pylori than caga that target different receptors of the host epithelial cell are therefore not included in the model. the modeling objective was to construct a logical network model that is capable to predict qualitatively how caga modulates the c-met receptor, and to compare hgf versus caga induced c-met signal transduction. only accurate and well-defined interactions were included in the model. the molecular interactions were all assembled manually by extensive use of literature search engines and databases . only data obtained from epithelial cell lines were considered for the model. the data were subjected to a careful meta-analysis; only data that were consistent with the current knowledge and did not interfere with recent publications were taken.

activation of the c-met receptor by its endogenous ligand hgf leads to autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain within the intracellular activation loop  resulting in an activation of the intrinsic kinase activity. subsequently, a multifunctional signal transducer docking site is formed by phosphorylation of y <dig> and y <dig>  <cit> . this docking site recruits intracellular adapters via src homology- <dig> domains , phosphotyrosine binding domains  and met binding domains .

recent studies have shown that infection of gastric epithelial cells by the bacterial pathogen h. pylori targets the c-met receptor and provokes some c-met-related cellular responses  <cit> . this includes especially the enhancement of cell scattering, which is mainly mediated by the bacterial virulence factor caga, translocated during infection via a t4ss into gastric epithelial cells.

in the following, the biochemical steps included in the logical model will be described briefly. the numbering corresponds to the hyperarcs in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> 

 <dig>  hgf is the natural ligand of c-met. upon ligand binding, c-met undergoes autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular region. phosphorylation of y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> located within the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain activates the intrinsic kinase activity of c-met  <cit> .

 <dig>  gab <dig> is subsequently recruited to activated c-met by direct binding to the tyrosine phosphate residues y <dig> and y <dig> of the receptor  <cit> .

 <dig> - <dig>  the c-met/gab <dig> complex forms a multivalent binding site for a number of downstream molecules, including shp <dig>  pi3k, grb <dig> 

 <dig>  fusion of gab <dig> with c-met induces tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with shp <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  activated c-met also interacts with shp <dig> independently of gab <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  the adaptor protein grb <dig> binds to the y <dig> docking site of c-met  <cit> .

 <dig>  c-met associates withpi3k via gab <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  c-cbl is a substrate of the activated tyrosine kinase receptor c-met  <cit> .

 <dig>  pi3k can also be activated by c-cbl  <cit> .

 <dig>  gab <dig> interacts with crk and crkl, two proteins with sh <dig> and sh <dig> protein interaction domains. this interaction is mediated via the sh <dig> domains  <cit> .

 <dig>  the c-met receptor associates with the shc <dig> adaptor, via the sh <dig> domain  <cit> .

 <dig>  grb <dig> binds to shc via its sh2-domain  <cit> .

 <dig>  phosphorylated c-cbl interacts with the sh <dig> domain of crk/crkl  <cit> .

 <dig>  activated crk/crkl recruits dock <dig> through its sh <dig> domain  <cit> .

 <dig>  dock <dig> binds and activates rac <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  rac <dig> directly binds and phosphorylates the transcription factor stat <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  activated c-met directly phosphorylates stat <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  pi3k activates ilk  <cit> .

 <dig>  pi3k converts the plasma membranelipid pip <dig> to pip <dig>  <cit> . the phosphatase pten selectively removes the 3-phosphate of pip <dig> to regenerate pip <dig>  counteracting pi3k activity  <cit> .

 <dig>  pdk <dig> is a key pip3-binding protein  <cit> .

 <dig>  akt <dig> is subsequently activated by pdk <dig> and ilk  <cit> .

 <dig>  akt <dig> phosphorylates a single serine residue of rac <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  akt <dig> activates pak <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  activation of rac <dig> leads to the activation of pak <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  rac <dig> interacts with iqgap- <dig>  thereby crosslinking actin filaments. under these conditions iqgap- <dig> does not bind to β-catenin and cannot dissociate α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex, leading to strong adhesion. when rac <dig> is not active, activated calmodulin allows iqgap- <dig> to interact with β-catenin to dissociate α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex  <cit> .

 <dig> , <dig>  pak <dig> stimulates jnk activity through a map kinase regulatory cascade. pak <dig> regulates the activity of an unknown map kinase kinase kinase, which controls activity of mkk <dig>  we used a dotted hyperarc between pak <dig> and mkk <dig> to indicate an unknown compound that links pak <dig> to mkk <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  jnk phophorylates the transcription factor c-jun  <cit> .

 <dig>  jnk phosphorylates the transcription factor elk <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  jnk phosphorylates atf <dig> on thr- <dig> and thr- <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig> - <dig>  hgf activates nf-κb through an akt <dig> -> pak <dig> pathway  <cit> . pak <dig> is required for the activation of nf-κb by activating the ikk complex through an unknown kinase. the hyperarc connecting pak <dig> and ikk is therefore also shown as unknown link. iκbα is phophorylated by the ikk complex and undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation, allowing nuclear translocation of nf-κb  <cit> .

 <dig>  gab <dig> interacts with rasgap sh <dig> domains, only under conditions when shp <dig> is not activated. shp <dig> downregulates rasgap by dephosphorylating rasgap binding sites on gab <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  grb <dig> forms a complex with sos <dig> and recruits it to the plasma membrane  <cit> .

 <dig>  sos <dig> is an exchange factor and activator of ras, which is downregulated by rasgap  <cit> .

 <dig> - <dig>  activated ras activates the raf <dig> kinase, which in turn activates the map kinase mek. mek activation leads to erk1/ <dig> activation  <cit> . ras proteins activate at least three families of downstream effector signalling pathways, involving raf kinases, phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -kinase, and ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors   <cit> . pi3k is also a downstream component of the adaptor gab <dig>  as such it is included in our model. we did not include the ras/pi3k/pip <dig> and the ras/ral-gef/ral pathways, because they are not described in the context of c-met signaling. for our model, we therefore only considered the ras-raf-mek-erk pathway.

 <dig>  erk1/ <dig> phosphorylates elk <dig> on its c-terminal activation domain  <cit> .

 <dig>  erk1/ <dig> phosphorylates and stabilizes c-myc  <cit> .

 <dig>  erk1/ <dig> phosphorylates ets <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  phosphorylated gab <dig> recruits plcγ <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig> , <dig>  plcγ <dig> hydrolyses pip <dig> to produce ip <dig> and dag  <cit> .

 <dig>  ip <dig> raises the calcium level by opening ca2+-channels  <cit> .

 <dig>  the activation of pkcα is ca2+-dependent. provided a high ca2+-level, dag binds to and activates pkcα  <cit> .

 <dig>  pkcα promotes activation of raf <dig> by direct phosphorylation  <cit> .

 <dig>  calmodulin is a ca2+-receptor protein and is regulated by the ca2+-level  <cit> .

 <dig>  iqgap- <dig> is a regulator of e-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion. when rac <dig> is not active, activated calmodulin allows iqgap- <dig> to interact with β-catenin to dissociate α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex. this leads to a reduction of cell-cell adhesions  <cit> .

 <dig>  attached h. pylori translocates caga via t4ss  <cit> . upon membrane localization translocated caga undergoes subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by c-src and fyn  <cit> . thus the node caga in the logical network corresponds to phosphorylated caga.

 <dig>  whereas resting host cells are characterized by almost inactive src kinases due to phosphorylation of their regulatory loops by c-terminal src kinase , it is known that h. pylori can transiently activate src family kinases by an unknown mechanism, which is figuratively shown as an inactivation of csk  <cit> .

 <dig> - <dig>  nascently phosphorylated caga activates csk and thereby leads to a subsequent inactivation of c-src and fyn  <cit> . as the activation of csk via caga occurs significantly later than the activation of other downstream events in the network, we set the time scale parameter of connection  <dig> on  <dig>  experimental data presented by tsutsumi et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  provide the basis for setting up two time scale scenarios. in the early events the translocated caga protein undergoes tyrosine phophorylation by src family kinases . in the later events tyrosine phophorylated caga binds and activates csk, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates src family kinases. the phosphorylation of caga has to occur at an earlier timepoint, because caga-csk interaction involves the sh2-domain of csk and is strictly dependent on caga tyrosine phophorylation  <cit> . csk then works as a negative regulator of caga-shp <dig> signalling, because the inactivated src family kinases lead to a down-regulation of the levels of caga phophorylation and subsequent diminished caga-shp <dig> complex formation.

in  <dig> mimuro et al. published data, that suggested that caga could interact with grb <dig> and thereby activate ras-raf-mek-erk  <cit> . this observation was clearly contradicted later by other groups. the groups of hatakeyama  <cit>  and naumann  <cit>  were not able to reproduce the published results of mimuro et al.. in light of these results and after careful evaluation of the available data we decided not to include the direct interaction between caga and grb <dig> in our network model.

 <dig>  phosphorylated caga directly binds to the adaptor proteins crk and crkl  <cit> .

 <dig>  phosphorylated caga binds and activates shp <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  shp <dig> inactivates fak by dephosphorylation and thereby induces/enhances cell scattering  <cit> .

 <dig>  fak phosphorylates pipkiγ <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylated pipkiγ <dig> associates with talin  <cit> .

 <dig>  fak physically associates with calpain <dig> and spatially couples it to its upstream regulator erk1/ <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  caga intracellularly interacts with phosphorylated c-met  <cit> .

 <dig>  in contrast to hgf activated c-met, caga replaces gab <dig> and/or grb <dig> and leads to plcγ <dig> activation  <cit> .

the model was built on the current understanding of the biochemical processes involved in hgf and h. pylori induced c-met signal transduction and iteratively improved by validation with published experimental results. if the proposed model failed to reproduce the experimental results, it was modified accordingly.

in total, the network model contains  <dig> species and  <dig> hyperarcs . the set of nodes includes  <dig> input elements  and  <dig> elements in the output layer .

network analysis: induction of the signalling cascades by hgf and by h. pylori
we first analysed the interaction graph underlying the logical network. two  feedback loops can be found in the network regulating caga phosphorylation by src family kinases. these loops, however, are not active during the early events because both feedback loops involve connection  <dig>  having a time-scale parameter of  <dig>  the computation of signalling paths revealed that  <dig> paths connect the input node hgf with one of the output nodes, whereas h. pylori may influence the ouput nodes only via  <dig> signalling paths . below we will discuss the reason for this difference in the number of signalling paths and show what the consequences of this reduced flexibility is.

the dependency matrix of the interaction graph  displays all functional dependencies between each pair of species. in the following we discuss some of these dependencies. hgf is an activator for the transcription factors stat <dig>  atf <dig>  c-jun and nf-κb, i.e. there are only positive paths from hgf to these nodes which can thus only mediate activating effects. in contrast, hgf is an ambivalent factor for erk1/ <dig> and its downstream effectors elk <dig>  c-myc and ets <dig>  i.e. there is at least one inhibiting and one activating path emanating from hgf to these species. the reason is that hgf has a positive effect on erk1/ <dig> via grb2-sos1-ras-raf1-mek but does also signal through rasgap, which has an inhibitory effect on ras and therefore on the map kinase cascade. however, we notice that the activity of rasgap on the other hand is downregulated by shp <dig> so that the above pathway running over ras is functional. in contrast to hgf, h. pylori is an activator for all seven transcription factors because erk1/ <dig> cannot be activated via grb2-sos1-ras-raf1-mek- and therefore only through the positive pathway pkcα-raf1-mek-erk1/ <dig> . another example for coexisting positive and negative effects is the α-catenin/β-catenin/e-cadherin-complex, for which both h. pylori and hgf are ambivalent factors, because they signal through rac <dig>  which has an inhibitory effect on iqgap- <dig>  and via calmodulin with a positive effect.

we then used the logical model to compute the response of the network  when the network is triggered with hgf  and  when c-met is stimulated by h. pylori , both for the early events .

interestingly, the resulting on/off states for the output nodes are identical for both triggers, but the signalling pathways that lead to these differ significantly . the main cause for these differences lies in the fact that h. pylori modulates the c-met receptor by translocating caga, which replaces adaptor molecules like gab <dig> and grb <dig> at the c-met receptor and leads to plcγ <dig> activation  <cit> . therefore, signalling events, including the whole pi3k pathway, that originate from the c-met/gab <dig> binding site in the hgf stimulated network are thus not included in the h. pylori triggered network. that is also the reason why the number of paths connecting h. pylori with the output layer is lower compared to the hgf case.

target identification: deactivation of erk1/2
to evaluate the usefulness and robustness of our model for the generation of in silico predictions, deactivation of erk1/ <dig> in the h. pylori triggered network was defined as an intervention goal having biomedical relevance. in silico identified targets would provide clues for anti-cancer therapies, as prevention of erk1/ <dig> activation would have an impact on cell scattering and thus invasiveness of tumour cells  <cit> .

a strong feature of cellnetanalyzer  is the possibility to compute minimal intervention sets . this function can be used to predict targets for knockouts  that lead to a desired response defined by an intervention goal. accordingly, erk1/ <dig> repression  was defined as intervention goal and h. pylori input was set to  <dig> and hgf input set to  <dig>  when searching only for single interventions , cna calculated  <dig> minimal intervention sets each proposing one knockout target . when hgf was the stimulus , cna finds only  <dig> knockout targets for erk1/ <dig> repression .

by comparing the miss for the two scenarios  stimulation with h. pylori and  stimulation with hgf) we can identify targets, that imply a deactivation of erk1/ <dig> for scenario  but not for . among those we chose plcγ <dig> for further evaluation.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the computed network response for the in silico knockouts of plcγ <dig> for h. pylori and hgf stimulation, respectively. in agreement with the computed miss, erk1/ <dig> is deactivated in the case of h. pylori stimulation , but is still activated in the case of hgf activation , demonstrating the different response of the network for the two stimuli. our model shows that the knockout of plcγ <dig> can be bypassed via grb <dig> – sos <dig> – ras – raf <dig> – mek in the case of hgf stimulation. next we wanted to verify this prediction experimentally. apart from plcγ <dig>  we also selected pi3k  and mek  as two further knockout candidates to be tested in experiments.

experimental validation of the predicted results from the model
mdck cells were used as a model system for the epithelial cells of the human gastric mucosa. the cells were stimulated with hgf or infected with h. pylori and the effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was evaluated via western blot analysis after cell lysis using anti-erk1/ <dig> and phospho-specific erk1/ <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 7a, erk1/ <dig> was activated after stimulation of the cells with hgf, as well as after infection with h. pylori, as demonstrated by the western blot analysis.

we then repeated the above experiments with different specific inhibitors to inhibit mek, pi3k and plcγ <dig>  when treating the cells with the pharmacological inhibitor pd <dig>  which specifically inhibits mek, our experimental results clearly indicated that erk1/ <dig> phophorylation was effectively reduced in the case of hgf stimulation as well as after infection with h. pylori . this corresponds to what we expect since mek is the only upstream effector of erk1/ <dig> in our model.

inhibition of pi3k using the specific inhibitor ly <dig> had no effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation for both stimuli, again in agreement with the model prediction.

for the inhibition of plcγ <dig> we used the specific inhibitor u <dig>  the western blot analysis could show that in the case of hgf stimulation, erk1/ <dig> activation was similar strong as in the untreated cells, but in the case of h. pylori infection erk1/ <dig> phophorylation was strongly reduced . this result confirms the prediction of the in silico knockout of plcγ <dig> in the logical model, which predicted no effect in the case of hgf simulation and a suppressive effect in the case of h. pylori infection .

CONCLUSIONS
a logical model of hgf- and h. pylori induced c-met signal transduction was presented. we used the formalism of logical interaction hypergraphs for network representation and analysis and it turned out that this qualitative approach is suitable for analysing a number of important aspects in this signalling network.

in a case study we could demonstrate the capability of the model to identify targets for erk1/ <dig> deactivation using the formalism of minimal intervention sets. three network species  were chosen for in silico knockout. the effects on erk1/ <dig> activity predicted from the model for both hgf and h. pylori stimulus could all be confirmed by experimental results in mdck cell culture, demonstrating the suitability of our logical model to generate in silico predictions for the effect of certain knockouts of species. this approach can also be used for the in silico identification of new targets against pathogen infection, as demonstrated here by the identification of plcγ <dig> as a target for erk1/ <dig> deactivation. inhibition of plcγ <dig> prevents h. pylori induced cell scattering, providing a possible intervention strategy against invasive gastric cancer.

as a major finding, our work shows that plcγ <dig> represents a key factor in h. pylori-induced erk activation. further, the identification of plcγ <dig> as a target for inactivation of erk could also have therapeutic implications. inhibition of erk1/ <dig>  which is critically important for the induction of cell scattering in h. pylori-infected epithelial cells, could represent a target for the treatment of invasive stomach cancers caused by h. pylori infection.

in the light of our observation, that the activation of erk by growth factor induced c-met signalling is not influenced by a plcγ <dig> inhibition, the use of specific pharmaceutical inhibitors for plcγ <dig> might thus represent a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent the pathogenic effects in h. pylori infection. furthermore, h. pylori eradication therapy however is complicated by increasing global antibiotic resistance in the pathogen. understanding of important epithelial signal transduction pathways  modulated by h. pylori could delineate potential chemopreventative agents to target oncogenic pathways. therefore, our study discovered plcγ <dig> as a potential novel therapeutic target that has the advantage that the microorganism can hardly develop resistances.

this work represents one of the first approaches in the direction of host-pathogen systems biology and is a first step to decipher signalling changes brought about by pathogenic bacteria. the need for the identification of new targets in treating pathogen infection in light of the growing emergence of resistance against antibiotics is a formidable task for the discovery of novel anti-infectives. in this context host-pathogen systems biology can provide highly relevant clues, not only for the elucidation how the pathogen captures the host signalling mechanisms, but also for the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

in our future work, the presented logical network will be systematically extended. this includes in particular the incorporation of relevant processes related to the cytoskeleton, tight junctions and adherence junctions. the three output nodes α-catenin/β-catenin/e-cadherin, talin and calpain <dig> represent starting points for this future work.
