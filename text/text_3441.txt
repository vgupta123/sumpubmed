BACKGROUND
adam  is a family of membrane-spanning multi-domain proteins containing a metalloproteinase-like domain and a disintegrin-like domain. currently, more than  <dig> adams have been identified in mammals. their biological activities implicate adams in fertilization, myogenesis and neurogenesis by proteolysis and adhesion. some types of adam are catalytically active metalloproteases and shed the extracellular domains of membrane-bound growth factors or receptors  <cit> . for example, adam <dig>  has been shown to cleave several substrates, including tumour necrosis factor alpha <cit> , heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor  <cit>  and transforming growth factor alpha  <cit> . studies of adam17-null mice have revealed that adam <dig> is critical in embryogenesis and plays an essential role in the supply of growth factors  <cit> . adams are also involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion through their interaction with integrins or syndecans. more than  <dig> adams have been shown to support integrin-mediated cell adhesion in vitro  <cit> . it has been reported that adam2-null and adam3-null male mutants are infertile and their spermatozoa lack egg-binding abilities  <cit> . both adam <dig> and adam <dig> are not metalloproteases because they lack catalytic site sequences in their metalloprotease domain. these studies clearly showed that non-proteinase members of adams also have significant roles in vivo.

we have reported the findings of adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> genes and their restricted expression in the human and murine nervous systems  <cit> . sequence analysis suggests that they are not metalloproteases, since they all lack a catalytic motif. it has been reported that adam <dig> protein is localised to the cell surface  <cit> , interacts with alpha-v beta- <dig> integrin heterodimer  <cit>  and the disruption of adam <dig> gene in the mouse results in premature death associated with ataxia and tremor  <cit> . although the cause of death in this mouse is unknown, for these phenotypes, impaired cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in the nervous system caused by loss of adam <dig> may be responsible. adam <dig> and adam <dig> share highly homologous sequences in their extracellular domains. especially, it is evident in their putative integrin binding loop sequences, cravncd, which is located centre of the disintegrin domain. these findings led us to hypothesize that adam <dig> is an integrin binder and plays an important role in the nervous system, as does adam <dig>  to determine the physiological functions of adam <dig>  we generated and analysed adam <dig> gene-targeted mice.

RESULTS
generation of adam22-deficient mice
mice carrying a targeted mutation in their adam <dig> gene were generated by homologous recombination . correct targeting events were confirmed by southern blot analysis . since the termination codon was introduced in exon  <dig> in the pro-protein domain, only the truncated form of the adam <dig> protein would be synthesized from this targeted allele. because a pro-protein domain is always removed in the mature functional adam-proteins by the furin-like proteases and is thought to be non-functional itself, we considered that this truncated form of adam <dig> protein has no function. absence of mature adam <dig> protein in homozygous mutants was confirmed by western blot analysis using the specific antibody, which recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of the adam <dig> protein . homozygous mutants showed no noticeable defects at birth and were indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous littermates during the first week. at postnatal day  <dig> , most of the homozygous mutants were distinguishable by abnormalities such as reduced body weight and uncoordinated movements of their limbs. after p <dig>  all homozygotes displayed severe ataxia  and began to die. to measure the survival rate and body weight of each genotype precisely, we backcrossed heterozygous male mutants to c57bl/ <dig> females more than  <dig> times. the resulting  heterozygous males and females were intercrossed and the produced offspring were analysed. the numbers of survivors of each genotype every  <dig> days are shown in table  <dig>  at p <dig>  the ratio of each genotype was in close accordance with the mendelian ratio . this result shows that adam <dig> is not essential for embryogenesis. at p <dig>  the average body weight of homozygous mutants was approximately half that of wild-type and heterozygous littermates . homozygous mutants died one by one after p <dig>  and all homozygotes died before p <dig>  of more than  <dig> homozygotes we have produced, none have survived more than  <dig> days after birth. meanwhile, heterozygous mutants looked normal, were fertile, and survived for more than one year without obvious defects.

histopathology of adam22-deficient mice
we have reported the predominant expression of adam <dig> mrna in the human and mouse brain by northern blot analysis  <cit> . to determine the distribution of adam <dig> transcript in the adult mouse cns precisely, in situ hybridisation analysis was performed using 35s-labeled rna probe. as shown in fig.  <dig>  adam <dig> mrna was expressed throughout the adult mouse cns. strong signal was detected in the cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal formation. in the spinal cord, hybridisation signal was restricted to the grey matter. the distribution of adam <dig> transcripts in the cns was quite similar with that of adam <dig>  whose neuronal expression has been reported  <cit> . these results suggest that the adam <dig> mrna expression is neuronal in the mouse cns.

based on the mrna distribution pattern, we performed immunohistopathological analysis of the cerebellum and hippocampus extensively. despite the high level of expression of adam <dig> mrnas in the cerebellar granule cells, granule cell layer was normally formed and purkinje cell morphology  of the mutant mouse looked intact . hippocampal formation was also normally formed . these results suggest that neuronal cell migration was not impaired in the mutant mouse. myelin-formation detected by mbp  staining of the mutant in the cerebellum  and spinal cord  was also indistinguishable with the wild-type littermate . in summary, we could not find any signs of abnormalities in the mutant mouse brain by the light microscopic examination.

next, the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of each genotype were analysed by toluidine blue stain, which reveals myelin formation. surprisingly, lack of myelin or thin myelin was observed in the sciatic nerves  and trigeminal nerves  in homozygous mutants. because no lesions were observed in the spinal cord , it was suggested that schwann cell specific myelination defect occurred in the homozygous mice. to analyse the state of myelinating schwann cells and axons, electron microscopic  analysis of the sciatic nerve was performed . schwann cells formed thin or no myelin in the homozygous mutant . in contrast, heterozygous mice showed complete myelination . morphology of the axons looked normal in each genotype. immunohistochemical analysis of the sciatic nerve showed that increased number of nuclei  and reduced staining of mbp  were remarkable in the homozygous mutant. the schwann cell marker, s <dig> staining signal was intensely observed in the homozygote as well as wild-type . these results suggest that proliferation of the schwann cells was not impaired but differentiation is severely delayed in the adam22-deficient mice.

novel adam <dig> transcript variants isolated from the peripheral nervous system
in the case of human adam <dig>  isolation of five splicing variants and existence of two terminating exons have been reported  <cit> . however, the latter terminating exon  of the mouse species has not been identified yet. to isolate the long form of mouse adam <dig> transcripts, at first, we sought the mouse genome by blast homology search. search results showed that the mouse genome contig nt_ <dig> contained most of the mouse adam <dig> gene. in this contig sequence, we found putative exons  <dig> and  <dig>  those sequences were quite similar to human adam <dig> isoform  <dig> . to confirm existence of transcripts, we designed primers on the putative exon  <dig> and performed rt-pcr using mouse cerebellum mrna as a template. ta-cloning of the amplified fragments and sequencing analysis showed that  <dig> of  <dig> clones were type  <dig> isoform ,  <dig> clones were type  <dig> isoform  and  <dig> clone  contained a novel exon between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  next, we performed rt-pcr analysis of mrnas purified from several adult mouse tissues, such as the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion , sciatic nerve and cultured primary schwann cells. interestingly, multiple dna fragments were amplified from each tissue , and length of major fragments in each lane was different. for example, length of major amplified pcr fragments from the sciatic nerve  and cultured schwann cells  were almost identical, and were shorter than those from other tissues. in contrast, major fragments from the drg  were longer than others. we performed ta-cloning and sequencing to analyse exon organization of the amplified transcripts . forty seven clones were isolated in total and were classified in  <dig> independent clones . comparison with the genomic sequence revealed the existence of  <dig> novel exons . these novel exons were flanked by well-defined introns that obey the gt-ag rule. exon organization of each clone was shown in fig. 8c. characteristic feature of adam <dig> transcripts is tissue specific insertion or skipping of exons. because the number of nucleotides of exons  <dig>   <dig>  27l,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  is a multiple of  <dig>  insertion or skipping of these exons will not change the downstream reading frame. known peptide motives were not found in the newly isolated sequences. this rt-pcr analysis is summarized as follows: adam <dig> transcripts were roughly subdivided in  <dig> groups, cns-form , drg-form  and schwann-cell-form . from these results, we concluded that adam <dig> is expressed in a cell-type specific manner, and plays an essential role in myelinogenesis in the pns.

discussion
in the present study, we examined the function of adam <dig> by generating mice that lacked the adam <dig> gene. adam22-deficient mice exhibited severe ataxia and premature death. in contrast, heterozygous mutants were healthy, fertile and survived more than  <dig> year without obvious abnormalities. the cause of death in the homozygous mutants is not clear; however, it is likely to be due to multiple seizures. this is because convulsive seizures were occasionally observed in homozygotes, after which the suffered mice appeared exhausted and, in most cases, died on the next day. it is known that cortical dysplasia resulting from aberrant brain development causes seizure syndrome  <cit> . for example, mice lacking the neuron-specific activator of cyclin  <dig>  p <dig>  exhibit seizures and a severe neuronal migration defect  <cit> . because adam <dig> protein is expressed on the cell surface and is likely to be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, we hypothesized that depletion of adam <dig> would generate aberrant neuronal migration. histochemical analysis was performed to verify this hypothesis. however, no marked abnormalities were observed in the mutant mouse brain, ruling out a critical role for adam <dig> in neuronal migration. another possible explanation is that the premature death in first  <dig> weeks of life is caused by the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. especially, nerves which control the breathing would be very important, because the respiration system undergoes significant maturation in the first 2– <dig> weeks after birth. for example, the myelin-deficient  rat, which carries a point mutation in the proteolipid protein  gene, exhibits ataxia, tremor, dysmyelination and dies at approximately postnatal day  <dig>  in md rat, early death is caused by the dysfunction of the brain stem which is essential for autonomic control of respiration during hypoxia  <cit> . further study is needed to verify the cause of death in adam22-deficient mice.

another interesting phenotype observed in adam22-deficient mice was hypomyelinogenesis. histopathological analysis revealed marked hypomyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves. however, myelin formation in the spinal cord and the brain was normal. it was therefore evident that hypomyelinogenesis occurred specifically in the peripheral nerves in the knockout mice, suggesting schwann cell dysfunction. in the mutant sciatic nerve, the density of pro-myelinating schwann cells  was markedly higher than that seen in heterozygotes. higher pro-myelinating schwann cell density and marked delay in myelin formation indicate that adam <dig> plays an important role in schwann cell differentiation, but not in proliferation.

investigations on why hypomyelinogenesis occurred in adam22-deficient mice centre on integrin. this is because several adams have been shown to interact with integrins via disintegrin domains  <cit> , and it has been suggested that alpha- <dig> beta- <dig> integrin on the schwann cell plays an important role in myelin formation  <cit> . in addition, laminin- <dig> is a key player in peripheral myelin formation, because laminin- <dig> deficiency causes dysmyelination in mice and humans, and its receptors, alpha- <dig> beta- <dig> integrin and dystroglycan, are also shown to be deeply involved in myelin formation  <cit> . the conditional knockout studies of beta- <dig> integrin and laminin gamma- <dig> in schwann cell suggested that both laminin- <dig> and integrins are essential for segregation of large bundles of axons in the early stage of myelin formation  <cit> . in contrast, the phenotype seen in the adam22-deficient mice was quite different: for example, unsorted bundles of axons were not seen in nerves and roots. we assume that adam <dig> partially modulates integrin-mediated signals or is involved at a later stage of myelin formation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we generated adam22-deficient mice and proved that adam <dig> plays an essential role in both the cns and the pns. the results of this study suggest that adam <dig> is involved in human diseases such as epilepsy and peripheral neuropathy. the human adam <dig> gene is relatively large, at  <dig> kb in length, and is comprised of more than  <dig> exons. it is assigned on 7q <dig>  where several chromosomal aberrations that are accompanied by neurological disorders have been identified  <cit> . further detailed molecular function analysis of adam <dig> may lead to progress in uncovering the mechanisms that underlie certain human neurological diseases.
