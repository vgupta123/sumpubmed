BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesised proteinaceous bactericidal substances produced by bacteria  <cit> . mutacins are bacteriocins produced by streptococcus mutans  <cit>  that are active against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . to date, four types of mutacin have been described: the mono- or di-peptide lantibiotic and the mono- or di-peptide non-lantibiotic mutacin  <cit> . lantibiotics contain unusual amino acids such as lan, bm-lan and dehydrated amino acid residues  <cit> . posttranslational modification of the prepeptide occurs through amino acid dehydration, formation of thioether bridges and cleavage of the leader peptide during transport outside of the cell  <cit> .

we previously classified mutacin-producing strains into  <dig> groups  and  <dig> clusters according to their activity spectra against bacterial pathogens and their immunity towards other mutacins  <cit> . the strain 29b producing mutacin h-29b was found to be closely related in its activity spectrum with strain t <dig> which produces mutacin ii   <cit> . the dna probe designed to hybridize with the muta gene of mutacin ii  also hybridised with the dna of strain 29b  <cit> . we present here a simple procedure for production and purification of mutacin h-29b, along with its partial characterization. the results show that the amino acid sequence of mutacin h-29b is identical to that of mutacin ii  over the first  <dig> residues. s. mutans strains of widely different origins may thus produce similar bacteriocins.

RESULTS
thermostability and ph stability
the activity of crude preparations of mutacin h-29b, calculated at  <dig> au/ml  at ph  <dig>  was not reduced in boiling water  after  <dig> h or after autoclaving , but lost 20% of its activity after  <dig> h at 100°c. all mutacin activity was retained at ph 2– <dig> after  <dig> h, but was reduced to 80% at ph 5– <dig>  to 60% at ph 8– <dig>  and to 30% at ph 9– <dig>  these results are in agreement with previously published results obtained on the activity of the mutacin-producing strain s. mutans 29b  <cit> .

purification and characterization of the mutacin h-29b
purification of mutacin h-29b was achieved by means of three hydrophobic chromatography steps . the final specific activity of the purified mutacin h-29b was  <dig>  ×  <dig> au/mg. as for mutacin ii   <cit> , the amino acid sequence of the purified mutacin h-29b was blocked at position  <dig> without alkaline ethanethiol treatment, indicating the presence of modified residues and the lantibiotic nature of mutacin h-29b. this n-terminal sequence was found to be identical to mutacin ii   <cit> . balakrishnan et al.  <cit>  also reported that mutacin m  <dig> presents the same n-terminal amino acid sequence. the absence of methionine at the n-terminus suggests that mutacin h-29b may be processed from a precursor form, as reported for lantibiotics in general  <cit> .

edman degradation performed after alkaline ethanethiol derivatization  <cit>  revealed a total of  <dig> amino acids. the complete sequence of mutacin h-29b confirms its identity with the mutacin ii . modified amino acids were obtained in positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  a bmsec signal seen as a doublet signal in cycle  <dig> indicates the presence of an abu or a dhb  <cit> . a sec signal was observed in positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> during sequencing, which indicate the presence of a dha residue  <cit> . in each case, the sec signal was not accompanied by a dser signal. at this stage, we can not tell if the dha or abu residues are implicated or not in the formation of thioether bridges. a deamidation was also observed for the asn and gln in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which can result from the treatment with alkaline ethanethiol. a phe residue was observed as a minor amino acid in position  <dig>  probably resulting from the carryover effect of the sequencing procedure.

comparison of the mutacin h-29b sequence with known bacteriocins revealed the high levels of homology to group aii lantibiotics . however, the tccs or tcc motif present at the c-terminus of other aii lantibiotics was not detected by edman degradation for mutacin h-29b. the dna sequence of the gene coding for mutacin h-29b will confirm whether the tcc motif is also present at the c-terminus of mutacin h-29b.

the molecular mass of mutacin h-29b determined by maldi-tof ms  is closely related to the one estimated for mutacin ii    <cit> . this strongly suggested that these two mutacins are identical, including the three terminal amino acids. thus, the experimentally-demonstrated thioether bridge pattern of mutacin ii   <cit>  can be proposed for mutacin h-29b. these would consist of one bm-lan bridge between the residues in positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , one lan bridge between residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as a second lan bridge between residues  <dig>  and  <dig> .

different strains can produce the same mutacin: s. mutans strains t <dig>  isolated in australia; ua <dig>  isolated in alabama, usa; and 29b, isolated in quebec, canada  <cit> , produce mutacin ii  ; s. mutans strains ch <dig> and ua <dig> produce mutacin i  <cit> ; and s. mutans jh  <dig>  isolated in florida usa  <cit> , and ua <dig>  isolated in alabama, usa  <cit> , produce the same mutacin, that only differs from mutacin b-ny <dig> by only two amino acids  <cit> .

genes coding for mutacin biosynthesis have all been located on the chromosome so far  <cit> . the mutacin ii  gene cluster has been identified and successfully transferred to a non-producing strain by transformation  <cit> . evolution of the mutacin-lantibiotics from a common ancestor and its propagation via mobile genetic elements is suggested by further observations. a silent transposase gene was reported in the upstream region of the genes coding for mutacin ii  production  <cit> . yonezawa and kuramitsu   <cit>  also observed direct repeats sequences flanking the smb locus with similarity to those of transposase genes directly downstream of the locus. sequences flanking the smb locus were found adjacent in the ua <dig> s. mutans genome . mutacin-lantibiotic coding genes could perhaps be transferred via mobile genetic elements.

CONCLUSIONS
mutacin  was isolated from an active liquid culture of s. mutans strain isolated in quebec  and proved to be identical to a previously characterized mutacin ii . mutacin-lantibiotic production by s. mutans seems to be widespread despite the fact that the reference genome strain for s. mutans  does not seem to produce any of the mutacin lantibiotics characterized to date.
