BACKGROUND
understanding human evolutionary history in the context of the colonization of the major continental regions by anatomically modern humans  over the past ~60- <dig>  years  has been a major focus of human population genetics since charles darwin and thomas huxley first proposed a single african origin for amh and a shared ancestry between humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . molecular studies over the past several decades have subsequently confirmed recent common ancestry between humans and the great apes  with common chimpanzees  and bonobos  our closest living relatives. in addition, studies of neutral genetic variation in the mitochondrial genome  and on the y-chromosome  have provided strong support for a common african origin of amh  <cit> . furthermore, analyses of autosomal genetic variation in the form of microsatellites  <cit>  uncovered patterns consistent with a serial migration of amh outward from central africa  as well as a time to the most recent common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees of  <dig> - <dig>  million years ago  <cit> .

microsatellites consist of short arrays of tandemly reoccurring repeats  of a 2–6 bp motif that vary in length between individuals and that generally have many distinct alleles within a population. abundant in diverse genomes , they are among the fastest-evolving dna sequences with relatively high mutation rates of at least 10-4–10- <dig> events per microsatellite per gamete per generation in humans  and other mammals . microsatellites mutate via a slipped-strand mispairing process during dna replication  and broadly follow a stepwise mutation model  <cit> , with ~68% of mutations at microsatellites with a dinucleotide repeat unit and >96% of mutations at microsatellites with a tetranucleotide repeat unit involving a change of a single repeat  <cit> . it is their high level of mutability compared to other genomic regions  and stepwise relationship between alleles that afford multiallelic microsatellites their generally higher informativeness in genetic studies than less variable markers such as biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms  .

since the landmark paper by bowcock et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the utility of microsatellites for the investigation of human evolutionary genetics, they have been used extensively to investigate genetic variation patterns among worldwide human populations. subsequent population-genetic studies have frequently utilized standardized genome-wide panels originally designed for linkage analysis  <cit>  that comprise hundreds of microsatellites genotyped in hundreds to thousands of individuals . in addition, an investigation into genetic variation patterns among chimpanzees utilized genotype data at putative orthologs of  <dig> human-derived microsatellites that overlapped those used in human studies  <cit> . recently, we reported the largest microsatellite dataset of its kind to date that subsumed these human and chimpanzee datasets and comprised  <dig> autosomal microsatellites common to all studies with genotypes in  <dig>  individuals from  <dig> human populations and in  <dig> individuals from six chimpanzee groups  <cit> . while our dataset provides a valuable resource for use in future population-genetic studies, such as those requiring a non-human out-group  <cit> , a major underlying assumption is that human and chimpanzee genotypes at orthologous microsatellites are commensurable.

microsatellite genotype data typically takes the form of polymerase chain reaction  fragment lengths obtained using locus-specific dna primer pairs to amplify the specific genomic region encompassing a particular microsatellite in a collection of individuals. the rationale being that changes in pcr fragment length reflect changes in repeat numbers at str regions embedded between the primer pair. thus, differences in pcr fragment length are commonly used as a proxy for differences in repeat number. however, there are a number of caveats to this approach. firstly, primer pairs are placed to optimize their pcr amplification efficiency rather than to satisfy specific distance criteria from the embedded str regions. the distances of a primer pair from the embedded str regions therefore vary markedly across microsatellites, and consequently pcr fragment lengths are incommensurable across microsatellites and do not allow absolute repeat numbers to be readily determined. secondly, changes in pcr fragment length resulting from insertion/deletion  events outside of the embedded str regions cannot be distinguished from changes in repeat number in the str regions . this is particularly acute in interspecies comparisons that utilize a common set of primer pairs to genotype all species as non-str sequences flanked by a primer pair may not be invariant across species .

here, we identify the genomic targets of the primer pairs used to amplify the  <dig> human-derived autosomal microsatellites included in the combined human-chimpanzee dataset  <cit>  in the chimpanzee reference sequence, and compare these chimpanzee sequences with their corresponding human sequences  <cit> . we investigate the extent of sequence differences at human and chimpanzee orthologs and their impact on human-chimpanzee comparisons based on two commonly used population-genetic statistics. calibrating pcr fragment lengths against the human and chimpanzee reference sequences, we infer repeat number in individual genotypes and use the resulting dataset to perform the first direct comparison of microsatellite variability and its determinants at orthologous microsatellites in humans and chimpanzees with genotype data for many individuals.

RESULTS
identification and analysis of chimpanzee microsatellite sequences
for all  <dig> autosomal microsatellites present in the human-chimpanzee dataset, putative pcr amplification targets were identified in release pantro <dig> of the ucsc chimpanzee reference genome sequence  <cit>  using an in silico pcr  approach  <cit>  applied to dna primer pairs obtained from the publicly available primer sequence files provided by the mammalian genotyping service  <cit> . despite the high level of sequence homology observed between the chimpanzee and human genomes  <cit> , it was unlikely that the genomic targets of all human-derived primers would be perfectly conserved in the chimpanzee genome. consequently, blastn “hits” for each primer were permitted to differ from its sequence by at most  <dig> nucleotides in alignment length and by at most 10% in sequence identity. using these primer alignment criteria, putative autosomal target regions were identified for  <dig> of the  <dig> microsatellites . a single target region on chromosome xq was identified by the primer pair of the remaining microsatellite ; however, only  <dig> of the  <dig> male chimpanzees in the dataset had homozygous genotypes---contrary to what would be expected for an x-chromosomal marker---and it was consequently excluded from further analysis.to maximize the likelihood that the epcr fragment identified for each microsatellite underlay the chimpanzee genotype data, its length was compared to the range of observed pcr fragment lengths. if an epcr fragment’s length differed markedly from its corresponding range of pcr fragment lengths, there was a higher likelihood that the genomic region amplified by the primer pair had been incorrectly identified. under the assumption that the genotype data captured the majority of length variability at each microsatellite,  <dig> microsatellites whose epcr fragment length was more than 6 bp outside of their pcr fragment length range were excluded from further analysis . six bp was a natural threshold: while there were a number of microsatellites with epcr fragment lengths between  <dig> and 6 bp outside of the pcr fragment length range, all epcr fragment lengths at these  <dig> microsatellites were at least 27 bp outside of this range. of the  <dig> microsatellites whose dna primer pair identified multiple epcr fragments that met our primer alignment criteria, four were retained for further analysis. the primer pair for two of the four “multiple hit” microsatellites  each identified two overlapping epcr fragments that shared the same reverse primer position but had different forward primer positions. both microsatellites were retained, with their target region defined as the smaller of the epcr fragments under the assumption that it would be more efficiently amplified via pcr. two further multiple hit microsatellites  were retained because only one of their epcr fragments met our length criteria; all of their other epcr fragments had lengths at least 32 bp outside of their pcr fragment length range.figure  <dig>

the repeat structure of the  <dig> microsatellites that met our criteria for retention was investigated, and str regions---defined as runs of four or more contiguous repeats of a motif 2– <dig> nucleotides in length  <cit> ---were identified within their epcr fragments . four microsatellites  had no str regions identified within their epcr fragment, while the remaining  <dig> had one , two , three , or four  str regions comprised of di-, tri-, tetra-, or penta-nucleotide repeat units .

comparison of fragment lengths at putative orthologs
under the null hypothesis of non-directional evolution, where in the absence of directional selection a microsatellite expands as often as it contracts within an infinite population, pcr fragment length distributions of orthologous microsatellites would be expected to be similar  <cit> . in this view, though microsatellites for which the chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length ranges do not overlap might reflect neutral genetic drift, they might also represent either pcr amplification of a non-orthologous region in the chimpanzee genome or different evolutionary constraints on the chimpanzee and human orthologs. in addition, under the assumption that the chimpanzee and human reference sequences are representative of a randomly sampled individual in the genotype dataset, epcr fragment lengths would be expected to lie within the union of the chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length ranges. epcr fragments that lie outside of their respective unified range had a lower likelihood of representing the genomic region amplified in the genotype data. thus, at  <dig> of the  <dig> microsatellites whose chimpanzee epcr fragments met our criteria for retention, the similarity of their chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length ranges in the genotype dataset was evaluated together with the location of their chimpanzee and previously reported human  <cit>  epcr fragment lengths within these ranges . one microsatellite  was excluded from further analysis as no human epcr fragment was available.figure  <dig>

consistent with the null evolutionary hypothesis, chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length ranges overlapped for  <dig> of the  <dig> microsatellites. four microsatellites  whose chimpanzee and human ranges did not overlap were excluded from further analysis. although their chimpanzee and human sequences were highly similar , their chimpanzee range was shifted toward smaller lengths compared with their human range and their heterozygosities  among chimpanzees  was markedly lower than among humans . considered together, these observations suggested that these four microsatellites may be regressing in the chimpanzee genome. compatible with this hypothesis, no str regions were identified within the chimpanzee epcr fragment of two of the four microsatellites .

at  <dig> of the  <dig> microsatellites with overlapping ranges, the chimpanzee range was subsumed by the human range, while the human range was subsumed by the chimpanzee range at only  <dig>  likely reflecting the smaller number of chimpanzees  compared with humans  in the dataset. just a single microsatellite  had the exact same range in humans and in chimpanzees. the remaining  <dig> microsatellites had partially overlapping chimpanzee and human ranges, with the chimpanzee range shifted toward smaller lengths compared with the human range at  <dig>  consistent with the observation that the majority of human-derived microsatellites are longer than their chimpanzee orthologs .

at the  <dig> microsatellites with overlapping chimpanzee and human ranges, chimpanzee and human epcr fragment lengths were jointly investigated with respect to their unified chimpanzee-human range. four microsatellites  whose chimpanzee epcr fragment length fell outside of their unified range and range overlap scores   <cit>  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, were below  <dig> ---the lowest ros among those microsatellites whose chimpanzee and human epcr fragment lengths lay within the intersection of the chimpanzee and human ranges---were excluded from further analysis.

comparison of str structure at putative orthologs
microsatellite variability is known to be influenced by the number of distinct str regions  as well as by their repeat unit size  and motif . thus, microsatellites whose chimpanzee and human amplicons contain discordant numbers of str regions, or str regions composed of different repeat unit sizes or motifs, might introduce interspecies incommensurability among genotypes. therefore, at each of the  <dig> microsatellites whose epcr fragment lengths and pcr fragment length ranges met our criteria for retention, the level of conservation of str regions embedded within their chimpanzee and human epcr fragments was evaluated.of the  <dig> microsatellites compared,  <dig> had the same str structure in both their chimpanzee and human epcr fragments . of the four microsatellites with no str regions identified within their chimpanzee epcr fragment, only one  was included in the comparison and alignment of its chimpanzee and human epcr fragments supported the presence of a single orthologous str region comprised of only three repeats in the chimpanzee fragment and eleven repeats in the human fragment. three microsatellites  whose chimpanzee and human epcr fragment sequences differed markedly , potentially reflecting pcr amplification of a non-orthologous region in the chimpanzee genome or misidentification of the genomic region via epcr, were excluded from further analysis.

of the  <dig> microsatellites with different numbers of str regions embedded in their chimpanzee and human epcr fragments,  <dig> were the result of a point or indel mutation disrupting an otherwise orthologous str region in either the chimpanzee  or human  epcr fragment. discordance at a further  <dig> microsatellites were the result of otherwise orthologous str regions being comprised of only two or three repeats in either the chimpanzee  or human  epcr fragment or both . of these  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> were retained for further analysis: the  <dig> and  <dig> microsatellites for which one epcr fragment contained an otherwise orthologous str region that was either comprised of only three repeats or disrupted by a mutation, respectively. the  <dig> microsatellites for which one epcr fragment contained an otherwise orthologous str region comprised of only two repeats, and seven microsatellites  that had one or more discordant str regions in their chimpanzee and human epcr fragments, were excluded from further analysis. intriguingly, at three of these seven microsatellites, a different motif had expanded in chimpanzees and humans to form an otherwise identically positioned str region. at two of these microsatellites, the motifs differed by just a single position---ctgt/ctgc  and cta/ata ---suggesting that an ancient point mutation in either the chimpanzee or human lineage might underlie this difference; at the remaining microsatellite  the motifs differed more markedly .

comparison of ortholog heterozygosities
investigation of he in the human-chimpanzee dataset for the  <dig> microsatellites that had either the same str structure in both the chimpanzee and human epcr fragments  or had an otherwise orthologous str region comprised of only three repeats  or disrupted by a mutation  in one epcr fragment found that the majority of orthologs generally had similar he in chimpanzees and humans . among the  <dig> microsatellites for which the human and chimpanzee epcr fragments had the same str structure ,  <dig> had he in chimpanzees and humans that were significantly positively correlated  and lay within  <dig> sd---calculated across all  <dig> microsatellites---of the identity line. the positive correlation remained significant when restricted to the  <dig> microsatellites with one tetranucleotide str region , but not when restricted to the  <dig> microsatellites with one trinucleotide str region  or to the  <dig> tetranucleotide and  <dig> mixed-repeat-unit-size microsatellites with two str regions  despite their he in chimpanzees and humans not being significantly different . the generally similar he in chimpanzees and humans is at odds with effective population size  estimates, where the larger ne of chimpanzees  <cit>  compared with humans  <cit>  would be expected to confer higher he
 <cit> . however, it is compatible with a scenario in which the effects of ne are largely abrogated by reduced mutability at human-derived microsatellites in chimpanzees compared with humans due to their generally shorter lengths .figure  <dig>

e at orthologous microsatellites in chimpanzees and humans are shown for   <dig> microsatellites where the human and chimpanzee epcr fragments had the same str structure, and   <dig> microsatellites where one or more str regions in the human or chimpanzee epcr fragment were comprised of only three repeats or disrupted by a mutation overlaid on the 92% utilization distributions for the microsatellites in a. each symbol’s line and fill color indicate the number of str regions in the chimpanzee and human epcr fragments, respectively, in b. black dashed lines depict the identity line, and black and grey dotted lines depict ± <dig> sd and ± <dig> sd departures from the identity line, respectively.



interestingly,  <dig> microsatellites had markedly lower he---more than  <dig> sd below the identity line---in chimpanzees than in humans . focusing on the  <dig> tri- and  <dig> tetra-nucleotide single str outlier microsatellites, their chimpanzee he were significantly lower than those of the  <dig> tri- and  <dig> tetra-nucleotide single str non-outlier microsatellites, respectively, while their human he were not significantly different . comparison of the distributions of repeat numbers at outlier and non-outlier microsatellites found that the outliers had significantly lower mean, maximum, and minimum numbers of repeats than the non-outliers in chimpanzees but not in humans . further, the distributions of repeat numbers at the outlier microsatellites were significantly more positively skewed than those at the non-outlier microsatellites in chimpanzees but not in humans . these findings accord with those of prior studies that identified positive correlations between mean and maximum numbers of repeats and he
 <cit>  as well as observed mutations at microsatellites with smaller numbers of repeats to be biased toward expansion  <cit>  and to increase in frequency as a function of repeat number  <cit>  owing to peculiarities in dna replication mismatch repair processes.table  <dig>

wilcoxon rank sum tests are shown for comparisons of continuous microsatellite sequence properties between the  <dig> tri- and  <dig> tetra-nucleotide single str outlier microsatellites and the  <dig> and  <dig> single str tri- and tetra-nucleotide non-outlier microsatellites. relative difference in means  was calculated by dividing the mean of the variable among the outlier microsatellites by the mean of the variable among the non-outlier microsatellites. p <  <dig>  are shown in bold.



at the  <dig> microsatellites for which the human and chimpanzee epcr fragments had discordant str structures owing to an str region being either comprised of just three repeats  or disrupted by a mutation  in one epcr fragment, he were found to be highly similar to those of the  <dig> microsatellites whose human and chimpanzee epcr fragments had the same str structure . he for the  <dig> microsatellites with an str region comprised of only three repeats in either their chimpanzee  or human  epcr fragment did not differ significantly between species . considering just the  <dig> microsatellites with two tetranucleotide str regions among these 17---the only group with a sample size greater than three---their he did not differ significantly from the  <dig> microsatellites with two tetranucleotide str regions comprised of four or more repeats in chimpanzees  or in humans . these findings support the retention of these  <dig> microsatellites for future analyses. while potentially discordant with prior observations that indicated four or more repeats were required for microsatellite mutability  <cit> , the three repeats present in the reference sequence might reflect truncations during reference sequence assembly or an unusually low number of repeats in the individual used to generate this sequence.

he for the  <dig> microsatellites with an otherwise orthologous str region disrupted by a mutation in either the chimpanzee  or human  epcr fragment did not differ significantly between species . considering the nine tetranucleotide microsatellites with two str regions in chimpanzees but one str region in humans, their he in chimpanzees were not significantly different from those of the  <dig> and  <dig> tetranucleotide microsatellites with one  or two  str regions, respectively, that had the same str structure in both species. additionally, the four tetranucleotide microsatellites with three strs in chimpanzees but two str regions in humans had he in chimpanzees that were not appreciably different from the  <dig> microsatellites with two tetranucleotide str regions . our findings with interrupted and uninterrupted arrays of tetranucleotide repeats therefore disagree with those of prior studies that found uninterrupted arrays of di- and tri-nucleotide repeats to be more polymorphic than those with interruptions both in genomic dna  <cit>  and plasmid construct  <cit>  environments. this discordance might reflect different tolerances to disruption by mutations of str regions comprised of tetranucleotide repeats compared with di- and tri-nucleotide repeats. however, we could not discount the possibility that some of the observed mutations might be rare variants captured in the reference sequence but largely absent in the general population.

impact of fragment length imbalances on estimates of genetic differentiation
during the alignment of chimpanzee and human sequences, it became apparent that nontrivial epcr fragment length differences that are not the result of embedded str regions existed, in accord with earlier studies of much smaller sets of microsatellites  <cit> . to investigate this further, at the  <dig> microsatellites that had either the same str structure in both the chimpanzee and human epcr fragments when considering str regions with three or more repeats  or had an otherwise orthologous str region disrupted by a mutation in one epcr fragment , the chimpanzee and human epcr fragment sequences were manually aligned and the number of nucleotides present in only one epcr fragment was tabulated .

non-str length differences at some microsatellites were appreciable , contributing up to an additional  <dig> nucleotides to the chimpanzee epcr fragment and  <dig> nucleotides to the human epcr fragment. the magnitude of non-str length differences was observed to decrease as a function of average str length across individuals for microsatellites with one or two str regions , consistent with the inverse relationship reported between flanking sequence divergence and str length at orthologous mammalian microsatellites  <cit> . such large differences create incommensurability between chimpanzee and human pcr fragment lengths, as chimpanzee and human pcr fragments of the same length may reflect different numbers of repeats. for example, the distributions of human and chimpanzee pcr fragment lengths at microsatellite na.d12s. <dig> were discordant , with the chimpanzee distribution shifted toward smaller lengths than the human distribution. however, when the distributions of the repeat numbers those pcr fragment lengths represent were compared the human and chimpanzee distributions were instead highly similar . conversely, at microsatellite d6s <dig>  while the distributions of human and chimpanzee pcr fragment lengths were similar , the distributions of repeat numbers were instead largely discrete . thus, the use of pcr fragment lengths in lieu of the repeat numbers they represent at orthologous chimpanzee and human microsatellites had the potential to detrimentally bias interspecies comparisons.figure  <dig>

to evaluate the extent to which chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length incommensurability might impact interspecies comparisons, pairwise estimates of the fixation index  and allele-sharing distance ---one minus the proportion of shared alleles---calculated on the basis of pcr fragment lengths and repeat numbers were compared. for these analyses, only the  <dig> microsatellites whose chimpanzee and human epcr fragments had the same str structure comprised of repeat units of a single size were retained. the  <dig> microsatellites for which an otherwise orthologous str region was disrupted by a mutation in one epcr fragment, as well as the  <dig> microsatellites containing two, three, or four str regions comprised of repeat units of different sizes, were excluded because of the resulting difficulty in assigning repeat number. under the assumption that within-species variability in pcr fragment lengths in the human-chimpanzee dataset are wholly due to changes in repeat number in embedded str regions, pcr fragment length genotypes were converted into the repeat numbers they represent via calibration against their chimpanzee and human epcr fragments .

next, separately for pcr fragment lengths and repeat numbers, pairwise fst was calculated among the  <dig> non-admixed human and five chimpanzee populations in the dataset with a sample size of at least five individuals . while fst values calculated on the basis of pcr fragment lengths and repeat numbers were highly correlated , interspecies fst values calculated on the basis of repeat numbers were significantly lower than those calculated on the basis of pcr fragment lengths . across all interspecies comparisons, a maximal fst reduction of  <dig> % was observed  with the magnitude of the reduction generally increasing with the distance of the human population from addis ababa, ethiopia, a reasonable proxy for the origin of the out-of-africa migration of amh . if fst values calculated on the basis of repeat numbers at these  <dig> microsatellites were instead compared with those calculated on the basis of pcr fragment lengths at all  <dig> microsatellites in the human-chimpanzee dataset analogous reductions were observed . similar patterns were observed when pairwise dps values were compared .figure  <dig>

these results are compatible with a scenario in which non-str length differences lead to the misalignment of orthologous human and chimpanzee alleles when they are represented by pcr fragment lengths, distorting numbers of shared and private alleles in interspecies comparisons. this distortion is magnified by natural increases in numbers of private alleles as a function of the human population’s distance from africa  <cit> , owing to the concomitant reduction in genetic diversity  <cit>  as well as increases in population isolation  <cit>  and human-chimpanzee dissimilarity . in this view, the cumulative effects of distortions across microsatellites inflated levels of human-chimpanzee genetic differentiation compared with those obtained with repeat numbers, with comparisons for human populations more distant from africa affected to a greater extent owing to their naturally higher numbers of private alleles.

interspecies differences in microsatellite properties and their effects on heterozygosity
our human-chimpanzee dataset comprised of  <dig> microsatellites with the same str structure in humans and chimpanzees and genotypes represented as repeat numbers  afforded us the first opportunity to directly compare and contrast determinants of variability at orthologous microsatellites in humans and chimpanzees with genotype data on many individuals. in these comparisons, the  <dig> microsatellites were grouped by the number of distinct str regions embedded in their sequence and by their repeat unit size. for each of the  <dig> microsatellites, the values of investigated measures can be found in table s <dig> , and a summary of the mean, minimum, and maximum values across microsatellites in each group appears in table s <dig> .

interspecies differences in microsatellite properties
in agreement with an earlier study of  <dig> orthologous dinucleotide microsatellites in chimpanzees and humans  <cit> , chimpanzee microsatellites were found to generally have significantly larger numbers of distinct alleles than their human orthologs . consistent with this observation, chimpanzee microsatellites were also observed to generally have significantly larger ranges of repeat numbers than their human orthologs . these findings accord with the substantially higher levels of genetic diversity observed among chimpanzees than among humans , reflecting the larger effective population size of chimpanzees  <cit>  compared with humans  <cit> . despite the higher numbers of distinct alleles present in chimpanzees, variance in repeat number was generally similar in chimpanzees and humans . this would suggest that the majority of chimpanzee-specific alleles lie in the tails of the repeat number distribution, in agreement with observed levels of human-chimpanzee differentiation  as well as the reported relationship between inter-population levels of genetic differentiation and the location of private alleles within their allele size distributions  <cit> .table  <dig>

wilcoxon signed-rank tests are shown for comparisons of measures of variation across individuals calculated separately among chimpanzees and humans. microsatellites were grouped by their number of separate str regions and repeat unit size. no comparisons were performed for microsatellites with one dinucleotide str region, two trinucleotide str regions, or three or four tetranucleotide str regions because of small sample sizes . average relative difference  was calculated by taking the average across microsatellites of the division of the value in chimpanzees by the value in humans. the standard deviation  in relative difference across microsatellites is provided in parentheses. p <  <dig>  are shown in bold.



mean pcr fragment lengths in chimpanzees were significantly shorter than those in humans . these findings were not wholly a consequence of non-str length differences between chimpanzee and human pcr amplicons , suggesting that chimpanzee microsatellites contain fewer repeats than their human orthologs on average. indeed, comparison of repeat number distributions at orthologous microsatellites found that chimpanzees generally had significantly lower mean, maximum, and minimum numbers of repeats than humans . across the  <dig> microsatellites in our dataset, the human ortholog was on average  <dig>  repeats longer than the chimpanzee ortholog, similar to the value of  <dig>  reported for  <dig> dinucleotide microsatellites genotyped in six chimpanzees and six humans  <cit> , but slightly smaller than the value of  <dig>  determined via comparative genomics  <cit> . thus, our findings further support the view that human-derived microsatellites generally have greater repeat numbers than their chimpanzee orthologs , potentially reflecting interspecies variability in directional biases in the mutation process  <cit> , the biological and evolutionary bases of which remain enigmatic.

effect of microsatellite properties on heterozygosity
in agreement with our earlier study  <cit> , the number of distinct alleles, the range of repeat numbers, and the variance in repeat number were generally positively correlated with he in both chimpanzees and humans . similarly, in accord with prior studies in humans  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster
 <cit> , the mean and maximum numbers of repeats were also generally positively correlated with he in both chimpanzees and humans . however, consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the minimum number of repeats and mean pcr fragment length were generally not significantly correlated with he in either chimpanzees or humans . while some of these observations might arise from a general correlation among the various measures , how can their patterns be explained in terms of their relationship to the microsatellite replication slippage mutation mechanism ?table  <dig>

spearman’s rank correlation coefficients  are shown for comparisons of microsatellite h
e with measures of variation across individuals calculated separately among chimpanzees and humans. microsatellites were grouped by their number of separate str regions and repeat unit size. no comparisons were performed for microsatellites with one dinucleotide str region, two trinucleotide str regions, or three or four tetranucleotide str regions because of small sample sizes . correlations with p <  <dig>  are shown in bold.



replication slippage occurs because of homology among microsatellite repeats, providing the opportunity for the two dna strands to realign incorrectly after polymerase dissociation and strand separation, introducing a loop in one strand and leading to microsatellite expansion or contraction after the resumption of replication  <cit> . the direct relationships observed between the mean and maximum numbers of repeats and he are consistent with a scenario in which the probability of slipped-strand mispairing during dna replication increases as a function of repeat number, with a concomitant increase in the probability of microsatellite mutation  <cit> . the absence of a similar relationship between he and the minimum number of repeats is compatible with the idea that the minimum number of repeats, while an important predictor of the lower bound of microsatellite mutability  <cit> , is not informative about overall levels of mutability. the direct relationships observed between he and the number of distinct alleles, the range of repeat numbers, and the variance in repeat number accord with the increased probability of observing heterozygous genotypes as a function of the number of available alleles and the concomitant increases in their range and variance. finally, as a consequence of pcr primer pairs being positioned to optimize their amplification efficiency rather than to satisfy specific distance criteria from the embedded str regions, the absence of a relationship between mean pcr fragment length and he accords with the view that pcr fragment lengths are not comparable in a meaningful way across microsatellites.

CONCLUSIONS
by identifying and comparing the genomic sequence and repeat structure of orthologous human and chimpanzee pcr amplicons that underlie the genotypes in the largest human-chimpanzee microsatellite dataset of its kind to date, our study provides new insights into the parallel evolution of orthologous microsatellites used in population-genetic studies for over a decade. our results demonstrate that human-chimpanzee differences within the flanking sequences of embedded str regions are frequent and can introduce non-trivial length imbalances into their pcr amplicons. the latter observation is important as it creates incommensurability among chimpanzee and human pcr fragment length genotypes, which we show can inflate the commonly used fst and dps population-genetic statistics by up to ~ <dig> %. our results therefore suggest that the findings of prior interspecies comparisons based upon pcr fragment length genotypes derived from a common set of dna primer pairs  should be interpreted with caution, as the extent to which non-str length differences contributed to their observed patterns remains unknown. furthermore, they indicate that future interspecies studies utilizing microsatellites should implement the approach we describe here, based either on available reference genome sequences or microsatellite-specific sequencing in a small number of individuals, to avoid potential pitfalls stemming from pcr fragment length incommensurability among species.

to overcome sequence-derived incommensurability among human and chimpanzee genotypes in the human-chimpanzee dataset, we use the human and chimpanzee reference sequences for  <dig> microsatellites whose str structure we found to be identical in both species to convert their pcr fragment length genotypes into the repeat numbers they represent . this resource offers new opportunities for more accurate comparisons of patterns of human and chimpanzee genetic variation in numerous areas of application than were possible with earlier datasets. while future studies jointly investigating millions of orthologous human and chimpanzee snps should have greater power to resolve fine-scale interspecies relationships than our dataset of  <dig> microsatellites, frequent homoplasy at orthologous positions in the human and chimpanzee genomes  <cit>  poses a significant challenge in developing the necessary resources for such undertakings. moreover, the findings of recent studies would suggest the joint investigation of future snp datasets together with our dataset of  <dig> “gold standard” microsatellites may afford future studies a more complete view of intergroup relationships than can be obtained from analyses of either marker type alone  <cit> .

finally, our study provides the first direct comparison of determinants of variability at orthologous microsatellites in humans and chimpanzees, jointly considering sequence properties together with measures of genetic diversity among human and chimpanzee populations. although it is important to note that we have not sequenced these human-derived microsatellites in each individual, and have instead assumed that pcr fragment length differences are wholly due to changes in their embedded str regions, we have no reason to suspect that these issues might have systematically affected the particular comparisons we have performed.
