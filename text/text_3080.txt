BACKGROUND
apple  fruit development involves a series of biochemical events determinant for qualitative traits, such as appearance, flavour and texture  <cit> . fruit growth involves cell divisions and cell expansion resulting from a dynamic interplay between cell turgor pressure, cell wall biosynthesis and remodelling  <cit> . apple ripening involves starch conversion to simple sugars, skin colour changes, ethylene production, a respiration burst and flesh softening  <cit> . reduction in tissue firmness combines a decrease in cell turgor pressure as well as cell wall polysaccharide remodelling and metabolism .

cell walls largely contribute to fruit textural characteristics. in apple, like other fleshy fruit, they are made of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose, together with some structural proteins  <cit> . apple cell wall polysaccharide composition and structure varies with genetics, developmental stages and growth conditions  <cit> . the relative content of the major cell wall sugars represented by galacturonic acid attributed to pectin, and glucose from cellulose and hemicelluloses increase during apple ripening  <cit> . galactose and arabinose content decreases during fruit expansion and further declines during ripening . this is due in part to β-galactosidases and α-arabinofuranosidases degradation of the galactan and arabinan side chains of the pectic rhamnogalacturonan i   <cit> . methyl ester substitutions of the homogalacturonan structural domain of pectins  are partly removed by the action of pectin methylesterases  during apple development  <cit> .

this metabolism of pectin increases cell wall porosity, decreases cell adhesion and affects fruit texture  <cit> . the loss of rgi galactan and arabinan side chains was associated with softening  <cit> , whereas high content of galactan side chains was associated with firmness  <cit> . a high arabinofuranosidase activity related to mdaf <dig> gene expression was reported in mealy apples  <cit> . pectin hg structure and its methyl esterification are also important for apple texture. down regulation of the mdpg <dig> gene coding a polygalacturonase maintains fruit firmness during ripening  <cit> . in contrast local action of pme  was associated with mealiness development  <cit> .

unlike pectin, the overall apple hemicellulose composition and molecular weight are not significantly affected during fruit development and ripening  <cit> . however, their structure and interactions with cellulose are likely remodelled, as observed in the changes of activities and gene expression levels of endo- <dig> -β-d-glucanase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase  and expansin which are involved in cutting, cutting and pasting and breaking hydrogen bonds between xyloglucan and cellulose .

in addition to cell wall chemistry and macromolecular interactions, apple texture elaboration involves other complex mechanisms related to tissue organization  and cellular water partition  <cit> .

as the whole fruit development is involved in texture elaboration  <cit> , we investigated the parallel evolutions of cell wall chemical composition and structure with that of cell wall related gene expression during fruit development and cold storage. the transcriptomic analysis focused on genes annotated for cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis, remodelling and degrading proteins as well as for structural proteins. because turgor pressure is involved in fruit development and texture, genes annotated for transporters were also analysed. gene expression results and correlation analyses between biochemical and transcriptomic profiles highlighted new candidate genes and provided new insights into possible coordinated activities involved in cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism during apple development and storage.

RESULTS
cell wall characterization
the global sugar composition of cell wall prepared as an alcohol insoluble material  was analysed at each developmental and storage stage . as expected, apple fruits accumulated starch during the developmental phases reaching  <dig>  % of the aim dry weight at 110daf. starch content decreased at harvest and during the cold storage period. the cell wall polysaccharides after deduction of starch glucose content in aim sugars  were mainly glucose, uronic acids , arabinose and galactose in decreasing order of proportion. the total amount of these  <dig> main sugars reached  <dig> to 88 % of nsp depending on developmental and storage stages. galactose content decreased constantly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nsp while uronic acids content increased slightly from  <dig>  to 29 % of nsp when fruits reached late development stages. smaller amounts of xylose, mannose, and traces of rhamnose and fucose were also detected. xylose and fucose contents increased slightly at ripening stages while mannose contents decreased. acetyl ester content also decreased during the ripening stages from  <dig>  % at 60daf to  <dig>  % of nsp at 2 m. in contrast, methyl ester content did not show any significant change.table  <dig> chemical composition of fruit cell wall

determination of hemicellulose fine structure
a structural profiling approach by enzymatic digestion coupled with maldi-tof ms analysis of the degradation products was used to follow modifications of hemicellulose fine structure. as apple hemicelluloses include xyloglucan , galactoclucomannan  and glucuronoarabinoxylan  , mannanase, xylanase and glucanase degradations were done sequentially. the order of the enzymatic treatments was chosen to maximise oligosaccharides release.

to facilitate enzymatic treatments, aim was first washed with water  and then partially depectinated by pectin lyase and rhamnogalacturonase . uronic acids  and neutral sugars  contents were analysed after each treatment. in the ws fraction, ua content increased continuously from  <dig>  % at 60daf to  <dig>  % of nsp at 2 m . in contrast, ns content decreased from  <dig>  % at 60daf to  <dig>  % of nsp after 2 months of cold storage . this decrease affected the mannose, galactose and glucose content, but not that of arabinose, which was the major sugar of this fraction . as expected, the subsequent pectinase treatment  had a drastic effect and removed  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nsp depending on the fruit stages . the amount of ns content decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nsp from 60daf to 2 m , including the majority of the released rhamnose, arabinose, mannose and galactose . the difference between 60daf and 2 m was mainly due to the decrease in galactose content in the ps fraction . no significant change was observed in ua content between 60daf and 2 m  but the majority of ua was released with this treatment .table  <dig> soluble acidic and neutral sugars content released by sequential treatment of aim

structure of mannose-containing polysaccharides
endo-β-mannanase treatment on the remaining extracts allowed access to mannan-rich hemicelluloses. the treatment released  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nsp at 60daf and 110daf and significantly less from harvest to 2 m with only  <dig> %nsp . no ua was detectable at early stages of development and only traces afterwards . at 60daf, hydrolysis products were mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, mannose and galactose, each representing  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nsp  and respectively only  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of their respective initial content in nsp, as most of them was already removed in the ps fraction . the lower ns content of the mannanase fraction at 2 m was mainly due to the decline of galactose and glucose content with only  <dig>  % nsp remaining for each.

galactoglucomannan fine structures recovered in the mannanase hydrolysates were assessed qualitatively by maldi-tof ms spectra analysis . as expected, ms spectra showed a series of more or less acetyl-esterified hexo-oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from  <dig> to  <dig> attributed to mannans/glucomannans/galactoglucomannans fragments. major fragments in the mean spectrum were attributed to hex4a <dig> , hex4a <dig> , hex5a <dig>  hex5a <dig> , and hex6a <dig>  oligomers. an ion with mass corresponding to hexose and pentose containing structures, hex3a <dig> and pen <dig>  respectively, was observed at mz  <dig> . minor structures identified were hex <dig> , hex <dig> , hex5a <dig> , hex7a <dig> , hex7a <dig> , hex8a <dig>  and hex8a <dig> . the spectra also revealed the presence of minor pento-oligosaccharides: pen3u <dig> , pen3u1a <dig> , pen4a <dig> , pen4a <dig> , pen4u1m <dig> , pen4u1m1a <dig>  and pen5a <dig>  arising from the minor contamination of the commercial mannanase by xylanase. principal components analysis  of annotated oligosaccharides ion intensity was done to provide a synthetic view of sample variations as well as of the variables contributing to these variations. this analysis revealed a clear change in fine structure of mannose-containing hemicelluloses during fruit development particularly during the early phases . pca of ms spectra showed that the acetylated oligomers hex7a <dig> and hex8a <dig> differentiated the fruits at 60daf.fig.  <dig> mean maldi-tof ms spectra  and principal component analysis  of ms ions of annotated oligomers in the mannanase  and glucanase  digests.  <dig> daf: 60 days after flowering,  <dig> daf: 110 days after flowering, h: harvest, 1 m: 1 month of cold storage, 2 m: 2 months of cold storage. nomenclature of xyloglucan oligosaccharides followed that of  <cit>  extended to account for acetyl groups noted a. in brief, it uses uppercase letters representing an individual 1 →  <dig> linked β -d-glucose residue and its pendant side chains. accordingly, bare glucose residue is designated by the letter g while when branched by α -d-xylosyl residue on o- <dig>  it is refers to x. with further extension of the branch by one β-d-galactosyl linked on xylose o- <dig>  the trisaccharide structure formed is referred to l and when the latter is further extended by one α-l-fucose residue linked at o- <dig> of galactose, the structure is then referred to f. hexose containing oligosaccharides attributed to galactoglucomannans were noted hex. pentose based oligosaccharides were noted pen. these codes are extended by u, m and a when the residues are substituted by an uronic acid, a methyl and and acetyl group, respectively. the number following the structure codes denoted the number of building structures and substituent groups in the oligosaccharides 



structure of xylose-containing polysaccharides
treatment of the endo-β-mannanase residues by endo-β-xylanase was performed to analyse xylose-containing hemicelluloses. this treatment released a small amount of neutral sugars, only 1 % of nsp at 60daf, which decreased during cold storage to  <dig>  % of nsp at 2 m . no acidic sugar was detected in this fraction . arabinose, galactose and glucose were the main neutral sugars detected at 60daf with  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of the initial nsp . after 2 months cold storage, more arabinose , galactose  and glucose  were detected . they represented  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of their respective initial content in nsp . rhamnose and xylose contents increased in 2 m samples with respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the initial nsp, representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of their initial content in nsp. in contradiction with the global ns measurements by colorimetry , the gc method showed an increase in neutral sugars released by the treatment after 2 m when compared to 60daf . due to the overall low amounts of the xylose-containing oligosaccharides in the hydrolysis products , xylanase hydrolysates were not further analysed.

structure of glucose-containing polysaccharides
endo-β-glucanase was applied on xylanase residues as the last enzymatic treatment to access xyloglucan structures. the treatment solubilized from  <dig>  %nsp at 60daf to a maximum of  <dig>  %nsp at harvest stage and decreased to  <dig>  % nsp at 2 m . only a very small amount of ua  was released from the harvest stage and thereafter. as expected, the main soluble sugar was glucose with respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  % nsp at 60daf and 2 m  and representing  <dig>  % at  <dig> daf and  <dig>  % at 2 m of the initial content in nsp. with no remarkable differences between 60daf and 2 m stages, smaller amounts of the other sugars were also solubilized. most of the released fucose, glucose and xylose were found in the glucanase hydrolysis products .

in consistence with the high content of glucose in the hydrolysates , xyloglucan oligosaccharides  were identified by maldi-tof ms analysis . the mean spectrum revealed the presence of major acetyl-esterified xygos: xxfga <dig>  and xlfga <dig>  together with other structures attributed according to their respective mass to xxg , xlg , gfg , xfg , xlxg , xlxga <dig> , xxfg , xlga <dig> , xxfga <dig>  and xlfga <dig> . minor fragments were also detected as hexo or pento-oligosaccharides and attributed to hex <dig> , hex4a <dig> , hex4a <dig> , hex <dig> , hex5a <dig> , hex5a <dig> , hex6a <dig> , hex7a <dig>  and hex8a <dig> , pen3u <dig> , pen3u1a <dig> , pen4a <dig> , pen4u1m <dig> , pen4u1m1a <dig> , pen5a <dig>  and pen5u1m1a <dig> . these fragments reflected the activity of the commercial glucananase on glucomannan as well as the presence of minor contaminating xylanolytic activities. if no significant change in global ns composition was observed, a clear change of the oligosaccharide fine structures occurred during fruit development, particularly between the early developmental phases  and the matures stages . while most of the xygos oligomers, and particularly xxg, gfg, xlxg, xxfga <dig>  xlfga <dig>  were representative of mature stages, the hexo and pento-polysaccharides distinguished the spectra of fruits in early development. particularly, hex6a <dig>  hex5a <dig>  hex7a <dig>  hex4a <dig>  hex4a <dig>  hex5a <dig>  pen5u1m1a <dig>  hex8a <dig>  hex <dig>  pen4u1m1a <dig>  hex <dig>  pen4u1m <dig> and pen3u1a <dig> were representative of the early stages .

transcriptome profiling
in order to identify genes potentially involved in the structural modifications of cell wall polysaccharides, transcriptome analyses were performed on the same samples used for cell wall biochemical analyses. transcriptomic profiling performed with the aryane_v <dig> microarray revealed that 42 % of the tested transcripts were expressed at one or more developmental stages for at least one of the  <dig> genotypes analysed. differentially expressed transcripts between subsequent developmental stages were identified with significant p-values for t-tests . the highest numbers of differentially expressed transcripts were observed between 110daf and harvest, and harvest and 1 m storage. to study the changes between apple development and fruit ripening, the transcriptome at 60daf was compared with the transcriptome at 2 m. a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified. subsequent hierarchical clustering analysis on expression profiles led to the selection of  <dig> transcripts displaying similar expression profiles for the  <dig> genotypes grown in both orchards when considering the  <dig> time series . microarray data were validated by rt-qpcr experiments on a subset of differentially expressed genes, using cdna from 60daf and 2 m apple fruits. a similar difference between gene expression levels was observed with both techniques  .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts during kinetic of apple development and ripening. graph represents the number of significant differentially expressed transcripts between  <dig> time points. transcripts are down-regulated or up-regulated, respectively in dark and in light grey, in comparison with the earlier stage of development.  <dig> daf: 60 days after flowering,  <dig> daf: 110 days after flowering, h: harvest, 1 m: 1 month of cold storage, 2 m: 2 months of cold storage



in aryane_v <dig> microarray, sense  and antisense  probes were designed for each annotated apple coding dna sequence , and 26 % of the differentially expressed probes corresponded to as transcripts. celton et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that these as transcripts were likely to be involved in small interfering rna  dependent negative regulation of the coding mrnas. this study only considered genes with differentially expressed sense transcripts.

sense transcripts with higher expression during early fruit development  or during fruit ripening and cold storage  were selected for further analyses, and represented respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the selected differentially expressed transcripts. based on genes annotations, they were classified into functional categories.  <dig>  % had annotations related to cell wall biosynthesis and/or remodelling, or solutes flux changes . in order to refine the selection, deduced protein sequence from these genes were analysed for subcellular targeting and protein domain annotation. the potential cellular locations of  <dig>  % of the proteins corresponding to these genes were analysed with the protanndb tool  <cit>  . in concordance with a function on cell wall modifications,  <dig> proteins with a signal peptide for endoplasmic reticulum  targeting were potential candidates to be exported to the apoplast. for  <dig> predicted transporters,  <dig> had surprisingly no predicted transmembrane domain.  <dig> of the  <dig> peroxidases had a predicted signal peptide for er targeting and  <dig> were predicted to belong to class iii peroxidase superfamily when analysed through the peroxibase tool. among the enzymes and proteins related to cell wall modification, 15 % could not be allocated to a coherent subcellular compartment. this was probably due to the prediction models used and/or to potentially truncated protein sequences which were deduced from the apple genome sequence and annotation  <cit> . in addition, some annotations were different between protanndb and cazy databases. for example, several proteins were identified as pectin lyase-like with protanndb, but were grouped as glycoside hydrolases  <dig>   or carbohydrate esterases  <dig>   in cazy database. such discordances probably resulted from the markedly different methods and criteria used for protein annotation.

a total of  <dig> cell wall related genes were selected, 82 % were expressed during the early developmental phases and the remaining 18 % were expressed during later developmental stages and storage. according to their expression pattern, early expressed genes were grouped in cluster a while the later expressed genes were in cluster b . cell wall genes from cluster a included mainly genes potentially involved in pectin and cellulose/hemicellulose metabolism, respectively  <dig> and  <dig> genes. several genes potentially coding expansins, galactosyltransferases, glycoproteins and many β-galactosidases were also identified in this cluster, as well as peroxidases and transporters. in contrast, few cell wall related genes were identified in cluster b. those identified were mainly involved in pectin degradation, and very few genes were involved in cellulose/hemicelluloses metabolism including genes coding expansins .table  <dig> molecular and biochemical function of selected genes potentially involved in cell wall dynamic

integrative analysis
gene expression networks were realized within each cluster . gene correlation in cluster a yielded one large network composed of  <dig> genes . a subset of genes in the network showed strong correlations  and was centred on a gene annotated for a glycoside hydrolase belonging to family  <dig>  grouping mainly glucanases . this subset was composed of gh <dig>  β-glucosidase , β-galactosidase , xth , fla , agp , peroxidase  and sugar transporter . another subset containing csla , fla  and β-galactosidase  also significantly correlated . two small correlation networks were drawn for genes in cluster b . two gene networks showed significant correlations . one showed correlations between genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes such as pg and pectin esterases  and genes encoding transporters . the other network showed strong correlations  between genes encoding expansin like a , expansin like b , β-galactosidase  and peroxidase .

transcriptomic profiles were tentatively correlated with the cell wall monosaccharides contents and the oligosaccharides enzymatically released from hemicelluloses in order to reveal concomitant events . total monosaccharide contents in aim  were considered, except for arabinose and rhamnose whose content did not change . oligosaccharides relative contents in glucanase digests were also considered as markers of hemicellulose structural changes .

glucose and uronic acids contents were the least correlated with the selected gene expression levels. expression profiles of cluster a genes expressed during early developmental stages were positively correlated with galactose and mannose contents, as well as oligosaccharides content attributed to mannans  and xylans . they were also negatively correlated with fucose and xylose content as well as with oligosaccharides attributed to xyloglucans . the opposite correlations were observed with expression profiles from genes belonging to cluster b, showing higher expression at mature stages.

strong correlations were observed between expression profiles of β-galactosidases and galactose content , between expression profiles of expansins and the structure xxg of xyloglucans , between expression profiles of cellulose synthase like-a and glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> and the structure hex6a <dig> of mannans during apple development and ripening .fig.  <dig> expression level of genes correlated with monosaccharide content or oligosaccharides relative content ms from glucanase digest during apple development and ripening: a β-galactosidases and galactose content, b expansins and xxg, c cellulose synthases like a and hex6a <dig>  d glycoside hydrolases family  <dig>  and hex6a <dig>  green bold lines correspond to genes expressed during early apple development and red bold lines correspond to genes expressed during apple ripening.  <dig> daf: 60 days after flowering,  <dig> daf: 110 days after flowering, h: harvest, 1 m: 1 month of cold storage, 2 m: 2 months of cold storage



discussion
modifications in the chemical composition of apple cell wall polysaccharides during fruit development and ripening have already been described  <cit>  as well as enzymes and genes expression involved in ripening  <cit> . however a more detailed view of genes potentially involved in cell wall polysaccharide chemical composition, structure, water flux during apple development and storage provides insights into the mechanisms affecting texture characteristics and highlights novel candidate genes involved in these processes.

a dual approach to characterize apple cell wall dynamic
biochemical cell wall analyses were done to assess the changes in polysaccharide composition and particularly that of hemicelluloses fine structure during apple fruit development. for the latter analyses, pectin was partially removed by water washes and pectinolytic enzymes as it was reported to mask hemicelluloses  <cit> . our results showed that compared with previous studies of xgos profiles , pectin in apple parenchyma cell wall did not have a major impact on hemicellulose accessibility to enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, the changes observed by maldi-tof ms in the relative proportion of ggm oligomers in the glucanase hydrolysate, followed the decrease in mannose content in the cell wall of the fruit in development. although these observations pointed to some degree of representativeness of the cell wall hemicelluloses enzymatic profiling, the hydrolyzates composition likely reflected readily accessible structures and not those in strong interaction. additionally, the endogenous modifications of polysaccharides structure and access during fruit development possibly affected the enzymatic hydrolyzates composition.

transcriptomic analysis provided access to genes encoding specific proteins and enzymes related to cell wall construction and remodelling during apple development, ripening and cold storage. genes were selected according to their annotations from different databases but their respective biochemical activities remain to be characterized. genome-wide expression analysis of apple fruit development has already revealed the coordination between gene expressions with specific fruit developmental stages from floral bud to ripe fruit  <cit> . genes expressed during early fruit development are mainly involved in cell proliferation and expansion  <cit> . recently, this approach revealed that the down regulation of mdpme <dig>  an early-expressed pectin methylesterase-coding gene during fruit development was linked to the apparition of mealiness, during fruit cold storage  <cit> . several other functional categories have also been reported, such as solute transport and cell wall metabolism  <cit> .

the present analysis confirmed that the number of transcripts detected was similar from early apple development to harvest stage and that it was not affected up to 2 months after cold storage  <cit> . however, remarkably more cell wall-related genes were specific to early developmental stages than to ripening and storage phases. this could be explained by the fact that analyses were carried out on distinct genotypes with different fruit texture evolution after harvest . this difference in gene expression profiles highlights the plasticity of the genome with different expression time-frames and/or other genetic/environmental factors affecting markedly metabolic pathways during the ripening process. indeed, variations in transcript profiles already observed between different apple genotypes support a genetic dependent regulation of fruit growth and ripening  <cit> .

pectin modification during fruit development and cold storage
during early apple development, genes involved in pectin metabolism were co-expressed with genes involved in hemicellulose metabolism and their remodelling by xth . concomitant expression of genes involved in biosynthetic and degradation functions is in line with observations that hydrolytic mechanisms are required to achieve a proper cell wall polysaccharide synthesis and organ development .

changes in cell wall composition were observed as expected during fruit development and ripening, such as a decrease in galactose content  <cit> . the increase in xylose, fucose and uronic acids likely resulted from both the cell wall enrichment in xyg and pectin depletion in neutral side-chains. the presence of uronic acids in the water washes of apple aim at the ripening stage supports the hypothesis that hg depolymerization by pg contributes to the decrease of fruit firmness  <cit> . the removal of methyl esters facilitates pg action  <cit>  but also favours cell adhesion and the rigidity of pectin network  <cit> . in peach and tomato, pectin methyl-esterification decreased during development and ripening concomitantly with the increased activity of pme  <cit> . in apple, pme activity was reported to decrease during ripening  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> pectin esterases coding gene  showed a decreased expression during apple development and ripening. however, as previously reported  <cit> , no global significant variation was observed in methyl ester content of pectin during apple ripening. it was suggested that these enzymes could have a very local activity, at tricellular junctions, whose effect could not be evaluated at the whole fruit level  <cit> . acetyl-esterification is also a common feature of apple pectin  <cit>  and may be the target for the ill-defined function of these esterases. the latter may contribute to the significant decrease in the global cell wall acetyl esterification observed between  <dig> daf and 2 m.

the specific expression of a gaut coding gene  was also noticed during the ripening phases, as well as a significant increase of ua content. this suggests that new pectin could be incorporated into cell wall even after the developmental stages. this is in accordance with the observation that early ripening tomato has still cell wall synthetic capacities while being disassembled  <cit> .

hemicellulose changes during fruit development and cold storage ripening
the semi-quantitative variations of hemicellulose structural domains observed during fruit development  were in accordance with observations made on other plant organs or fruits  <cit> . this variation suggests different roles for different xyg fine structures in relation with cell wall expansion and extensibility mechanical properties by yet unclear mechanisms  <cit> . in several fruits, including apple, distinct xyloglucan transglycosylase/hydrolases -coding genes are expressed in young and mature fruits and are likely to contribute to xyg structure  <cit> . particularly found expressed in the early development phases in this study, xth gene expression was highly and positively correlated  with the expression of glycoside hydrolase gh <dig> , β-glucosidase , β-galactosidase , glycoproteins , peroxidase  and sugar transporter  . it points out the key role of xyg in the cell wall dynamic together with other cell wall events including remodelling of cell wall polysaccharides by hydrolases, oxidative reactions and likely cell turgor regulation. indeed, xyloglucans have been shown to be involved in cell wall mechanics, acting on the stability of microtubule cytoskeleton and the cellulose microfibrils biosynthesis and organization  <cit> . the concomitant expression of fla genes  with xyg remodelling suggests that the proposed cell adhesion and plant mechanical implications of fla proteins  <cit>  associate specific xyloglucan structures. genes potentially coding a dual α-l-arabinofuranosidase/α -xylosidase  and α-l-fucosidase  were also highly expressed during early apple development. these genes should be further characterized as they may be involved in developmental regulation of xyg structure  <cit> . in addition, the xylosidase/arabinofuranosidase may also be implied in the remodelling of arabinan side chains of pectin, glucuronoarabinoxylan and/or agp structures.

the present study revealed that galactoglucomannan , a minor component of apple hemicellulose, undergoes fine structural changes during early fruit development. it co-occurred with the high expression of one csla gene  , whose arabidopsis homolog was shown to encode mannan synthase  <cit>  and has a potential key role on cell expansion  <cit> . in particular, this csla gene expression was positively correlated with the detection of the hex6a <dig> structure in glucanase digest  and with the expression of the glycoside hydrolase gh <dig> gene  . the strong correlation of one csla  gene expression with the β-galactosidase expression profile    suggests that β-galactosidases may also be involved in the control of ggm synthesis and deposition in the wall. the function of ggm in primary walls remains unclear. their potential interactions with cellulose  <cit>  make them a candidate to control microfibrils aggregation and thus cell wall expansion  <cit> . this is consistent with the existence, at least in tomato, of mannan-degrading enzymes with transglycosylase activity  similar to xth activity  <cit> .

the large amount of mannose and glucose released by the combined action of pectin lyase and rhamnogalacturonase  suggests that ggm could be associated with pectin. such an association would also be affected by ripening as the amount of glucose decreased in 2 m samples when compared with 60daf. the specific timing of ggm biosynthesis in early fruit development and metabolism as fruit enlarges points to a specific role most likely during and/or just after cell division with an implication in cell-cell adhesion as in tomato  <cit>  and/or in the first rapid firmness decline observed during early fruit development  <cit> .

xylanase profiling did not show fine structural modifications of the minor glucuronoarabinoxylan  content in apple. this was likely due to the partial hydrolysis of the gax by the xylanase contaminating the mannanase used in the previous hydrolysis step but also probably due to hindrance of the binding/active sites by xylan substitutions. indeed, the xylanase activity contained in the following glucanase was able to release some more xylan oligomers. overall, the mannanase- and glucanase-released xylo-oligomers revealed that gax was particularly present at 60daf and 110daf, with different fine structures. there is no information on fine structure modifications of xylan-based polysaccharides in other fruits. as for ggm, the function of gax in apple remains to be established. in arabidopsis, xylan can be linked to pectin through agp  <cit>  and in tomato glucuronoxylan  are partly linked to ggm  <cit> . the identification of arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in the products of mannanase and xylanase hydrolysis supports the proposed connections between gax and the agp/pectin rgi complex. as with xth and mth, xylanase with hydrolase but also transglycosylase activity exists in fruit  <cit> , opening the way for xylan remodelling mechanisms. since tomato gux were located in cell wall lining the intercellular spaces  <cit> , it would be of interest to search for apple gax in a similar location and test their involvement in the formation of large intercellular spaces in fruit flesh during cell expansion.

expansins are also important proteins for loosening xyg-cellulose interactions during cell expansion  <cit> . they have been found in developing fruit, such as tomato  <cit> , pear  <cit> , strawberry  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . our results showed that  <dig> expansin  or expansin-like  genes  were specifically more expressed during early fruit development . their deduced protein sequence had various level of similarity with expansin domains from others fleshy fruit  . in contrast, the protein sequence from the  <dig> expansin-like genes   identified during fruit ripening was very different, suggesting different biochemical characteristics and biological functions . their gene expression profiles were correlated with oligosaccharides xxg relative content , suggesting a target preference for this fine structure, or their involvement in cell wall integration of new xxg structures. expansin genes  expression was also correlated with that of one β-galactosidase . this observation suggests that galactosylation of xyg structure may be involved in the recognition of xyg/cellulose complex by expansin.

two groups of β-galactosidases
β-galactosidases are common highly active enzymes during apple development and particularly during the ripening stage  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> genes coding β-galactosidases were expressed during early apple development and had glycoside hydrolase  <dig> domain . they are similar to those identified in tomato and japanese pear, but different from the arabidopsis atbgal <dig> acting on xyloglucans  <cit>  . in particular,  <dig> of these apple β-galactosidases were very similar to ppgal <dig>  ppgal <dig>  and ppgal <dig> whose expression was at their highest in expanding fruit but decreased drastically upon the onset of ripening  <cit> . these enzymes can potentially target several cell wall structures, such as agp, pectic rgi galactan side-chains, xyloglucan or galactoglucomannans. the positive correlation of the  <dig> apple β-galactosidases expression pattern with galactose content  suggests that rgi galactan side chains hydrolysis might not be their target unless these enzymes act also as transglycosylases as suggested by franková and fry  <cit> . in such a case, these enzymes would have more complex functions in the remodelling of cell wall polysaccharides. they might control pectin and hemicellulose polysaccharides interactions with cellulose through the modulation of their side chains structure , or regulate remodelling enzymes such as xth/xet by modifying xyg galactosylation . in any case, these glycosidases appear central in the remodelling of cell wall along with cell expansion.

three other β-galactosidase genes were observed preferentially expressed during apple ripening . these β-galactosidases gene expression profiles were weakly and negatively correlated with galactose content . two of them  corresponded to the up regulated β-galactosidase genes  during apple storage in controlled or regular atmosphere at 1 °c  <cit> . protein analysis showed that they were highly similar to the ripening specific pear proteins ppgal <dig> and ppgal <dig>  respectively , which suggests that they may play similar roles in apple and pear ripening  <cit>  in pruning of rgi galactan side chains  <cit> . ripening-specific β-galactosidase gene expression has also been reported in tomato  <cit>  and down-regulation of one of them, tbg <dig>  resulted in reduced fruit softening  <cit> .

these results emphasize the complexity of the β-galactosidase family which merits further studies to assess if it could be split into two groups, one principally acting on the regulation of cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins galactosylation, and another one mainly pruning pectin rgi side chains.

potential others actors in cell wall dynamics
peroxidases participate in a range of physiological processes  <cit> , such as cell wall degradation by cleaving polysaccharides bonds through the generation of reactive oxygen species  . genes encoding peroxidases were found mostly expressed during early apple development. some of them had expression profiles correlated with those from proteins and enzymes involved in biosynthesis, remodelling and degradation of cell wall polysaccharides. these results support a role for these enzymes in cell development as reported for arabidospis cell root elongation  <cit>  but their mechanism of action remains unclear. indeed, beside polysaccharide degradation, certain ros can inversely contribute to cell wall cross-linking and therefore limiting cell expansion  <cit> . results from this study suggest that the regulation of apoplastic ros production is important for cell wall biosynthesis and modifications during apple development.

during fruit growth and ripening, changes of internal turgor pressure lead to modifications of tissue mechanical properties  <cit> . transporters have a major role in the regulation of turgor pressure by acting on apoplastic/cell solutes concentration and ph that affect osmotic pressure  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , genes encoding ions and sugar transporters were found highly expressed during early developmental phases . their expression was highly correlated with genes involved in polysaccharides biosynthesis and degradation. four genes encoding ion and sugar channels/transporters were preferentially expressed during apple ripening  and correlated with genes related to pectin degradation . these early and late expressed transporter genes require further studies with regard to their implication in the regulation of turgor pressure during fruit expansion and ripening. during ripening, apple softening is known to involve a decrease in cell turgor pressure  <cit> . it would be of interest to assess the role of the hexose/sugar transporter genes expressed during late phases on the fate of the phloem downloaded sugars in the apoplast  <cit>  with regard to the change in water compartmentalization observed in ripening apples  <cit> . regulation of osmolytes concentration in ripening apples may contribute to changes in cell turgor pressure and loss of fruit firmness as proposed for grape berries  <cit> . this mechanism concomitant with cell wall polysaccharide remodelling and degradation may also participate in the elaboration of different apple textures, such as those perceived as mealiness and meltiness.

CONCLUSIONS
in addition to known cell wall pectin changes during apple fruit development and cold storage, this study revealed changes in hemicellulose fine structure particularly during early fruit development. the associated characterization of the transcriptome highlighted genes potentially involved in hemicellulose metabolism and the changes observed. at the ripening stage, the low number of genes identified was more specific of pectin metabolism. this study also pointed to β-galactosidases whose roles during fruit growth and ripening remain to be characterized in regard to the targeted substrates and molecular function. correlations observed between expression profiles from ion and sugar transporters, peroxidases and cell wall-related genes open the way to further studies on the interplay between cell wall assembly/disassembly mechanisms and cell turgor regulation during fruit development.
