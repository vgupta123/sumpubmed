BACKGROUND
sweet and umami taste involve tas1r receptors, which belong to the subclass  <dig> of the gpcr super family and are distantly related to the v2r pheromone-, metabotropic glutamate- and calcium sensing receptors  <cit> . they have a large n-terminal extracellular domain that is linked by a cysteine-rich domain to the seven transmembrane domains  <cit> . heterologous expression and functional analysis showed that cells co-transfected with tas1r2-tas1r <dig> responded to a variety of natural and artificial sweeteners, while the combination tas1r1-tas1r <dig> responded to l-amino acids  <cit> . in line with observed differences in the perception of these compounds between humans and rodents  <cit> , the artificial sweeteners aspartame and cyclamate, and the sweet proteins brazzein, monellin, and thaumatin only activate the human but not the rodent tas1r2-tas1r <dig> heteromer  <cit> . further studies of mouse-human interspecies chimeras and point-mutated receptors revealed that cyclamate interacts with the part of htas1r <dig> encompassing the seven transmembrane regions, whereas aspartame interacts with the n-terminal domain of htas1r <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the cysteine-rich motif in the n-terminal domain of htas1r <dig> is required for the activation of the sweet receptor by brazzein  <cit> . these results and modeling studies on the basis of the solved x-ray structure of the mglur <dig> ligand binding domain strongly suggest that multiple sites in both receptor subunits are involved in the activation of the sweet receptor by its ligands  <cit> . interestingly, differences in taste perception are not limited to sweet compounds but also have been observed for 2- propanoic acid sodium salt , which suppresses the sweet taste of various compounds in humans but not in rats  <cit> . functional studies of the human and rat sweet taste receptor recently showed that lactisole inhibits the human tas1r2-tas1r <dig> heteromer but not that of rats  <cit> . moreover it could be shown that that the lactisole sensitivity of the human sweet taste receptor involves the tas1r <dig> subunit  <cit> . thus, the inhibition of the sweet response by lactisole in humans is due to structural differences between the rat and human sweet taste receptor. using mutational analysis we investigated the molecular basis for these differences.

RESULTS
application of the artificial sweetener saccharin to hek293t-gα16gust <dig> cells transfected with the cdnas for the rat sweet receptor rtas1r3-rtas1r <dig> or its human counterpart htas1r3-htas1r <dig> elevated intracellular calcium levels . the responses were dose-dependent with half maximal effective concentrations  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for the human heteromer and of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for the rat receptor heteromer. thus, the rodent receptor is ~ <dig> fold less sensitive to saccharin than the human receptor. this shows subtle functional differences between the human and the rat sweet receptor. in addition to saccharin also other sweet tasting compounds of various chemical classes such as the disacchride sucrose, the dipeptide derivate aspartame, the sulfamate cyclamate, the dihydrochalcone neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, and the terpenoid glycoside stevioside the activated the human receptor . like its human counterpart, the rat sweet taste receptor could be robustly activated by saccharin, sucrose, and stevioside . but in contrast to the human receptor, aspartame, cyclamate, and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone did not activate the rat receptor  which reflects species specific variations in sweet taste perception  <cit> .

lactisole inhibited the responses of cells transfected with the cdnas for the human receptor to all tested sweeteners  while it did not inhibit the responses of cells transfected with the rat sweet receptor . this is well in line with previous studies of the receptor function  <cit> . based on the inhibitory effect of lactisole on the human but not on the rat receptor heteromer, we next asked which amino acids cause the functional difference of the receptors. we therefore analyzed cells co-transfected with cdnas of the interspecies sweet taste receptor combinations, i.e. htas1r3-rtas1r <dig> or rtas1r3-htas1r <dig>  the combination htas1r2-rtas1r <dig> responded to aspartame, saccharin, sucrose, and stevioside but not to cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone . the responses induced by all four agonists were lactisole insensitive . the combination rtas1r2-htas1r <dig> clearly responded to the sweeteners cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, although with markedly reduced amplitudes. aspartame, saccharin, sucrose, and stevioside failed to activate this receptor combination . this indicates that the htas1r <dig> subunit is involved in the response of the human sweet taste receptor to cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone. notably, the responses were lactisole sensitive . in line with previous observations  <cit>  we therefore conclude that the lactisole sensitivity is solely mediated by the htas1r <dig> subunit.

next we wanted to know which part of htas1r <dig> mediates the sensitivity to lactisole. to address this point we constructed two chimeric receptors. in the receptor chimera tas1r3-rn-htm we fused the n-terminal domain of rtas1r <dig> to the c-terminal part containing the transmembrane regions of htas1r <dig>  in the complementary chimera tas1r3-hn-rtm the human n-terminal domain was fused to the segment of the rat subunit encompassing the transmembrane regions. cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding htas1r <dig> and tas1r3-hn-rtm responded to aspartame, saccharin, sucrose, and stevioside but not to cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone . the responses to all four agonists were lactisole insensitive . cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding htas1r <dig> and tas1r3-rn-htm responded to all sweeteners tested . the responses to all six agonists were lactisole sensitive . based on these findings we conclude that the activation the human sweet receptor by cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone involves the htas1r <dig> transmembrane regions. moreover, the sensitivity towards lactisole is determined by the htas1r <dig> transmembrane regions.

sequence comparisons  between htas1r <dig> and its rat and mouse orthologs revealed  <dig> amino acid differences in the transmembrane regions. as mice and rats are lactisole insensitive while humans are lactisole sensitive, we reasoned that the amino acids responsible for this species difference are conserved in the rodent receptors but variable between rodents and humans. we therefore excluded  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids because they vary between rat and mouse. due to the polar nature of lactisole we assumed that it is membrane impermeable and should therefore interact with amino acids that are accessible from the extracellular site. based on this assumption we identified  <dig> amino acids  as the most promising candidates. we assumed that the conversion of one or several of these amino acids from the rodent to the human form should confer the lactisole sensitivity to the rat receptor. to test this hypothesis we created seven rtas1r <dig> variants  that contained 1– <dig> amino acids of htas1r <dig> . the functional analysis of these receptor variants revealed that receptor mutant m <dig> confered lactisole sensitivity to the heteromer, while all other rtas1r <dig> mutants did not . thus, the  <dig> amino acids exchanges l735f, v738a, and i740a of mutant m <dig> are sufficient to confer lactisole sensitivity to rtas1r <dig>  to test whether all exchanges in m <dig> are equally important, we created three variants, m6/ <dig>  m6/ <dig> and m6/ <dig> . in each of these, we reconverted one of the three human amino acids present in the mutant m <dig> back into that of the rat receptor. in case the amino acid is important for the inhibition of the sweet receptor, the variant should loose its lactisole sensitivity. only mutant m6/ <dig>  l735f and i740a, was lactisole insensitive, while the two other variants m6/ <dig>  v738a and i740a, and m6/ <dig>  l735f and v738a remained lactisole sensitive . thus, we concluded that the alanine to valine exchange in position  <dig> in transmembrane segment  <dig> is crucial for the lactisole sensitivity. to confirm this, we created a rtas1r <dig> variant where we only substituted the valine at amino acid position  <dig> by an alanine. functional analysis of this receptor variant, rtas1r3-v738a, co-transfected with rtas1r <dig> revealed that it was activated by saccharin, sucrose, and stevioside, but not by aspartame, cyclamate and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone . thus, rtas1r3-v738a shows the same agonist profile as the wild type rat receptor . however, in marked contrast to the rat wild type receptor, the response of rtas1r3-v738a was always lactisole sensitive .

to test if rtas1r3-v738a displays the same degree of lactisole sensitivity as the human receptor, we determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration  of lactisole on rtas1r3-v738a and compared it with the ic <dig> values of the human receptor and the mutants m <dig>  m6/ <dig>  m6/ <dig>  and m6/ <dig>  although all variants except the lactisole insensitive mutant m6/ <dig> were inhibited by lactisole, we observed subtle differences . the ic <dig> values were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the human receptor,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for m <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  m6/ <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  for m6/ <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for rtas1r3-v738a . thus, the human receptor and the mutants m <dig> and m6/ <dig> behave identical while the mutants m6/ <dig> and rtas1r3-v738a are ~ <dig> fold less lactisole sensitive. this result shows that the replacement of lysine  <dig> by phenylalanine is required for full lactisole sensitivity of the mutant rat receptor.

notably, the gain of lactisole sensitivity in the rodenttas1r <dig> variants m <dig>  m6/ <dig>  m6/ <dig>  is accompanied by a ~50% reduction of the signal amplitude compared to the wild type rtas1r <dig> . in marked contrast, the loss of lactisole sensitivity by the rtas1r <dig> mutant m6/ <dig> led to an increase in the signal amplitude . the diminished signal amplitudes are not caused by individual differences in the expression rates of the receptor variants . moreover the v738a receptor variant, that contains just a single amino acid exchange also showed a ~ <dig> % reduced amplitude compared to the native rat sweet taste receptor . this reduction is independent of the sweet taste agonist . the activation of the tas1r2-tas1r <dig> receptor by different sweeteners involves several receptor sites  <cit> . as the v738a amino acid exchange leads to an agonist independent amplitude reduction, this observation in combination with its localization in the fifth transmembrane region argues for a global or regional alteration of the receptor structure instead of a specific change at the agonist binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the lactisole insensitivity of rat sweet taste receptor is caused by valine  <dig> in transmembrane region five. the additional replacement of a lysine residue by a phenylalanine at amino acid position  <dig> again in transmembrane region five is sufficient to increases the lactisole sensitivity of the mutant rat receptors to the level of the human counterpart. thus, transmembrane region five is critical for the interaction of lactisole with the sweet receptor. the observation that the mutant receptors displays a generally reduced sensitivity towards all agonists suggests that the lactisole insensitivity of the rodent receptor might be more likely caused by an inaccessibility of the lactisole binding site rather then by its direct disruption. instead the lactisole insensitivity of the rodent receptor more is likely a side effect that is caused by a steric alteration in the fifth transmembrane region of the rat tas1r <dig> subunit induced by the valine at amino acid  <dig>  recently functional studies of the mouse and human sweet taste receptor in combination with mutational analysis led to a model of the lactisole binding site in human tas1r <dig>  <cit> . this model predicts that the alanine  <dig> in human tas1r <dig> which corresponds to valine  <dig> of rat tas1r <dig> is not directly involved in lactisole binding although it lies in close proximity to the lactisole binding pocket. the proximity of this amino acid to the predicted lactisole binding pocket further supports our conclusion that valine  <dig> in rat sweet taste receptor prevents the access of lactisole to its binding site.
