BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus , a novel orthobunyavirus, has swept through the major part of europe in the period 2011– <dig>  reaching as far north as finland, turkey in the east, and spain in the south  <cit> . a serological survey of blood samples, collected in the period november  <dig> – january  <dig>  from a representative sample of cattle in the netherlands indicated a high seroprevalence of antibodies against sbv  <cit> . so far, the impression is that the clinical impact of the disease on ruminant livestock is limited  <cit> . a vaccine against sbv has been developed  <cit>  and may be a possible preventive instrument against infection. presently, there is no data available to refute the assumption that natural sbv infection results in long-term immunity  <cit> , as was seen earlier with natural infection of cattle with bluetongue virus serotype  <dig>  <cit> . in that respect, it is of interest to know how long  virus-neutralizing antibodies are present in naturally infected animals. newborn calves acquire passive immunity from their dams by ingestion and absorption of antibodies present in colostrum. the estimated duration and benefit of this passively derived humoral immunity can vary greatly depending on the colostrum production  and the quantity of antibody ingested and absorbed  <cit> . passive immunity can block the production of serum antibodies when vaccine is administered to calves with maternally-derived antibodies  <cit> . in that respect, it is useful to know how long it takes for maternal antibodies against sbv to disappear in young animals born from infected dams. to examine the development and the course of neutralizing-antibodies against sbv over time, in a dairy herd in the eastern part of the netherlands where sbv rna was detected in a high proportion of culicoides caught in the autumn of  <dig>  <cit> , all animals were blood-sampled five times in a 17-month period, and tested for sbv specific neutralizing antibodies.

RESULTS
at the 1st sampling , all adult cows  tested seropositive, only four calves  tested seronegative. seventeen months later at the fifth sampling , 80% of the adult cows still tested seropositive, while only 9% of the cows < 1year of age tested seropositive . median 2log vnt titer of the adult cows dropped from  <dig>   to  <dig>   in a period of  <dig> months . it can be assumed that the adult cows became infected around the time that sbv rna was detected for the first time in culicoides biting midges caught at this dairy farm on  <dig> september  <dig>  <cit> . this means that at least 24months after natural infection, animals most likely were protected against re-infection.

eleven heifers seroconverted  in september 2012) and one dairy cow seroconverted between the september and december  <dig> samplings. the low rate of seroconversions matched with a significantly lower  proportion of sbv-infected culicoides observed in  <dig> compared to  <dig>  <cit> , and it can be assumed that there was a much lower level of sbv-circulation in the area in  <dig> compared to  <dig> 

calves that were bled ≤  <dig> days after birth had a median 2log vnt titer of  <dig>  and became seronegative  within 5– <dig> months . the presence of maternally-derived antibodies may hamper the effective response to vaccination. therefore, it is important to consider the age at which the calves lose their maternal antibody, previous to starting a vaccination campaign. there are sparse reports on the course of decay of maternal antibodies against orthobunyaviruses in ruminants. tsutsui et al.  <cit>  showed that dairy calves lost their maternally derived antibodies against akabane virus at an age of approximately  <dig> months, while grimstad et al.  <cit>  showed that young white-tailed deer lost their maternal antibodies against jamestown canyon virus at an age of 5– <dig> months. our results seem to be in range with the above-mentioned studies. to achieve an effective response to vaccination it can be advised to vaccinate calves at an age of at least  <dig> months.

there was a definite positive relationship  between the vnt titer of the dam and the vnt titer of the corresponding calf  of  <dig> dam-calf combinations sampled on the same day : the higher the vnt titer of the dam, the higher the vnt titer  of the calf.

CONCLUSIONS
our field data support the assumption that natural sbv infection in adult cows results in persistence of specific antibodies for at least two years. based on the observed decay of maternally-derived antibodies in calves, it is presumed safe to vaccinate calves against sbv at an age of approximately 6months.
