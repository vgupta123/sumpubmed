BACKGROUND
the grain weight of rice  and other cereals is determined by the rate of grain growth and the duration of the growth period  <cit> . high temperature stress increases the growth rate of grain during the early ripening period and reduces the duration of growth, but the increase in the rate of grain growth fails to compensate for the reduction in the duration of grain growth, which ultimately results in a decrease in final grain weight  <cit> . previous studies reported that high nighttime temperatures are more harmful to grain weight in rice and other crops than high daytime temperatures, because a deficiency of carbohydrates occurs in the leaves and culms due to increased respiration loss under high night temperatures  <cit> . rice is one of the word’s major food sources, feeding more than half of the global population, and the world rice production must increase by 1% annually to meet the growing demand for food that will result from population growth and economic development. unfortunately, the global surface temperature is rising consistently and the minimum nighttime temperature has increased approximately three times as much as the corresponding maximum daytime temperature over the past few decades  <cit> .

it is well studied that the typical symptoms caused by high temperature stress during rice grain filling include an increased rice grain-filling rate, a low amylose content, an increased chalkiness degree and a poor milling quality  <cit> . under high temperature stress, many of the starch synthase-related enzymes, such as granule-bound starch synthase , soluble starch synthase  and starch debranching enzyme , were shown to be regulated by high temperatures  <cit> . a high temperature can also play a role in the down-regulation of the isoforms of the sbe genes  and up-regulation of the sss isoforms , and some starch-consuming genes, i.e., α-amylase  that cause low amylase contents in rice grain under high temperature stress  <cit> . previous studies reported that the expression of cyppdkb and beiib was down-regulated by high temperatures, which resulted in an increase in rice grain chalkiness, suggesting that beiib and cyppdkb may be two of the candidate genes that play a critical role in grain chalkiness  <cit> .

the development of cereal endosperm, including rice, goes through three major phases. in the first phase, the endosperm mainly undergoes cell division and differentiation to increase cell number. in the second phase, macromolecules accumulate to complete the endosperm cell enlargement, and in the third phase, the endosperm reaches maturity by undergoing starch and protein transformation  <cit> . it is well known that the damages and responding molecules of high temperature stress move from the second to the third phase of endosperm development, and the influence of high temperatures on endosperm development have been studied at enzyme/protein  <cit>  and gene  <cit>  levels. previous studies also reported that the weight of rice grain was permanently damaged under high temperature stress at the early milky stage , and rice grain quality and weight could not be reversed, even if optimum temperature conditions were provided after the high temperature stress  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism underlying these observations remains unclear.

the advent of next-generation high-throughput rna sequencing technology has revolutionized transcriptome studies  <cit> . the technology is not only a powerful tool for discovering the full length of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, novel splice junctions, novel transcripts, alternative transcription start sites and rare transcripts  <cit> , but can also detect and quantify gene expression using digital measurements, and is especially sensitive for low-expressed genes  <cit> . in addition, rna-seq data show a high level of reproducibility in both technical and biological replicates  <cit> .

in the present study, we used illumina sequencing to compare the transcriptome differences between heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice lines responding to high night temperatures at the first phase of rice endosperm development . the goals of the current work were to identify potential candidate genes involved in the high night temperature response in rice. this may provide genetic resources that can be used for the improvement of heat-tolerant characters in rice. in addition, this work may provide a starting point for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the high night temperature stress response in rice.

RESULTS
high night temperatures decreased grain plumpness  of rice
it has been reported that plant growth and grain weight are strongly influenced by temperature  <cit> . in this study, rice grains were exposed to high night temperatures at the early milky stage , followed by normal growth conditions until maturity, and the grain plumpness of the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines was determined and compared. the results showed that grain plumpness of the two lines decreased after 48 h  of high night temperature stress, and the decrease ratio of grain plumpness in the heat-sensitive line decreased far more than in the heat-tolerant line . this indicated that high night temperatures have different effects on heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice lines.

sequencing information
to compare the transcriptomes between the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines responding to high temperature stress at the early milky stage, cdna libraries were prepared from rice grain and subjected to rna-seq analysis on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. a total of  <dig>  billion raw reads were generated from the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines.

a total of  <dig>  billion  high-quality 101-bp paired-end reads were selected for mapping to the nipponbare reference genome by tophat  <cit> . the alignment results showed that  <dig> million  of the high-quality reads were successfully mapped to the reference genome of o. sativa . of the mapped reads,  <dig> - <dig> % were mapped to exonic regions,  <dig> - <dig> % to intronic regions,  <dig> - <dig> % to intergenic regions and  <dig> - <dig> % to spliced regions . these results suggest that a significant number of transcripts likely originated from alternative mrna splicing or novel genes.table  <dig>

transcript analysis in response to high night temperature
gene expression levels can be estimated from illumina sequencing data based on the number of raw reads  <cit> . to identify differentially expressed transcripts , the number of fragments mapped to each gene was calculated and normalized using fragments per kb per million fragments   <cit> . the fpkm value of each gene from the treatment vs. control was calculated according to the following criteria: p-value ≤  <dig>  and fold change  log2 ≥  <dig>   <cit> . the transcripts with fpkm values that fit the above criteria were considered for further analysis and are referred to as the high night temperature response transcripts  in the heat-tolerant or -sensitive lines in the present study.

a total of  <dig>  transcripts showed up-regulation and  <dig>  transcripts showed down-regulation in the heat-sensitive line , whereas  <dig>  transcripts showed up-regulation and  <dig>  transcripts showed down-regulation in the heat-tolerant line, with a p-value ≤  <dig>  and fc log2 ≥  <dig> . among the degs,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated, both in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice lines. interestingly,  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated in the heat-tolerant line but up-regulated in the heat-sensitive line, and  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in the heat-tolerant line but down-regulated in the heat-sensitive line.figure  <dig>

to assess the reproducibility of rna-sequencing data, a cluster analysis of the 2-fold change values of the differentially expressed transcripts from three biological replicates was conducted, and the dendrogram analysis results  showed that the three biological replicates of the treatments and controls were clustered into one cluster, which suggested that the reproducibility of rna-sequencing is reliable. to confirm the validity of the deg data, rt-qpcr analysis was performed on  <dig> randomly selected genes, which indicated that these genes showed a similar gene expression to the pattern predicted by the rna-sequencing method .

geneontology  analysis for htrts
web gene ontology annotation plot  software was used to perform the go classifications and to draw the go tree to classify the up- and down-regulated transcripts into putative functional groups for the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were assigned go terms for the heat-sensitive and -tolerant lines, respectively. among the  <dig>  transcripts from the heat-sensitive line , there were  <dig>  transcripts  at the cellular level,  <dig>  transcripts  at the molecular level and  <dig>   transcripts at the biological level. among the  <dig>  transcripts from the heat-sensitive line , there were  <dig>  transcripts  at the cellular level,  <dig>  transcripts  at the molecular level and  <dig>  transcripts  at the biological level . within the cellular component category, transcripts that corresponded to cell  and cell organelles  were the most abundant. binding  and catalytic activities  were the most abundant groups within the molecular functional category. a total of  <dig> go functional groups were assigned to the biological processes category, among which metabolic processes  and cellular processes  were the most highly represented.figure  <dig>

a comparison of the go trees of the degs between the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines revealed a higher number of down-regulated transcripts involved in extracellular regions, and a higher number of up-regulated transcripts involved in membrane-enclosed lumens at the cellular location category in the heat-sensitive line compared with the heat-tolerant line. this indicates that a high night temperature disrupts the cell-cell interactions and plasmalemma functioning in plant cells, and these effects exhibited different patterns in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines. in the molecular functional category, there was a higher number of down-regulated transcripts involved in nutrient reservoir and translation regulator activities in the heat-sensitive line compared with the heat-tolerant line. for the biological processes category, there was a higher number of up-regulated transcripts involved in reproduction and reproductive processes in the heat-sensitive line compared with the heat-tolerant line. this suggests that a high night temperature affects the reproduction of the plant cell, and the effects were different between the heat-sensitive and heat–tolerant lines.

degs of the htrts between the heat-tolerant vs. heat-sensitive lines
to identify differentially expressed htrts between heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, the changes in the expression levels between the  <dig>  degs  from the heat-sensitive line and the  <dig>  degs  from the heat-tolerant line were further compared. the transcripts that showed a relative fold change  ≥  <dig>  were selected for downstream analysis. a total of  <dig> transcripts showed different expression between the heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice, and the base sequences and fpkm values of the  <dig> transcripts are presented in additional file  <dig>  the results suggested that a high night temperature triggered thousand of transcripts to differentially express in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, but only  <dig> transcripts showed a significant difference  in gene expression between the two lines. we suggest that these findings result from the similar genomics of the two rice materials  and the results provided a solid basis for our further study on selecting and cloning heat-resistant gene in rice.

of the  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in both the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines. in addition,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in the heat-tolerant line but down-regulated in the heat-sensitive line, and the other  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated in the heat-tolerant line but up-regulated in the heat-sensitive line .figure  <dig>

functional annotation of the degs of the htrts
to annotate the  <dig> degs of the htrts, assembled transcript sequences were blasted to the national center for biotechnology information  website, against the non-redundant  protein database with a cut-off e-value of 10− <dig>  among the  <dig> degs,  <dig> were functionally annotated based on the nr-ncbi database . based on the functional annotation, the  <dig> unigenes were classified into six groups: oxidation-reduction , metabolic , transport , transcript regulation , defense response  and photosynthetic  processes. of the  <dig> htrts ,  <dig> were found to have homologous genes but without functional annotation, whereas six htrts did not show any hits in the nr-ncbi database.table  <dig>

expression patterns of the unigenes
electron transfer is a fundamental process in all living organisms. in plants, most electron relay systems lie in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and in the photosystems in chloroplasts. in the present study, five unigenes  involved in electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and one  in the photosystem were found to be differentially expressed in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines after high temperature exposure. among the five unigenes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the molecular functions of three unigenes  was related to cytochrome p <dig> activity. cytochrome p <dig>  which catalyzes electron transfer through the pathway from nadph to flavin adenine dinucleotide , then to flavin mononucleotide , and finally to heme groups containing redox partners  <cit> , is also reported to be involved in reproductive development and act as a maternal regulator of seed size by stimulating integument cell proliferation in arabidopsis  <cit> . one unigene  with an annotation of molybdopterin-binding domain protein, which is known as the molybdopterin cofactor, is required for eukaryotic oxidoreductases to catalyze the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in a single polypeptide electron transport chain with electron flow from nadh-fad-cytochrome b5-molybdopterin-no  <cit> . another unigene  is alternative oxidase, which is a second terminal oxidase in the mitochondria, and which transfers electrons directly from reduced ubiquinol to oxygen forming water  <cit> .

comparing the gene expression patterns between the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, four unigenes  were up-regulated in both the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, but up-regulation was more pronounced in the heat-sensitive than in the heat-tolerant line . interestingly, one of the cytochrome p <dig> unigenes  showed a 3-fold up-regulation in the heat-sensitive line but more than a 2-fold down-regulation in the heat-tolerant line. the unigene , which is involved in electron transfer in the photosystem, showed up-regulation in the heat-sensitive line but down-regulation in the heat-tolerant line. it was reported that the overexpression of the p <dig> cytochrome gene cyp78a in arabidopsis produced a general growth phenotype such as reduced fertility, and the knockout line of the p <dig> cytochrome gene cyp78a <dig> showed a decreased cell number but not a decreased cell size  <cit> . in our study, the p <dig> cytochrome unigenes in the heat-sensitive line pronounced more up-regulation than in the heat-tolerant line, but the heat-sensitive line showed lower grain plumpness compared with the heat-tolerant line, which suggests that a higher expression level of the p <dig> unigenes would restrict grain plumpness in rice. collectively, these results suggest that the electron transfer chains of mitochondrial respiration and the photosystems were influenced by high night temperatures, but there were differences in the damage patterns between the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines.figure  <dig>

amino acid metabolism was influenced by high night temperature
some amino acids or metabolic intermediates play an important role in plant growth and developmental processes, as well as in the resistance of plants to a variety of stresses, including both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, brassinosteroids, a class of plant-specific steroidal hormones, were reported to influence grain yield, plant height, leaf angle, grain size and tiller number  <cit> . gamma-aminobutyric acid , a non-protein amino acid converted by l-glutamate, was reported to be related to a blast pathogen  <cit>  and salt stress  <cit> . aspartic proteases,which are distributed in all living organisms, were reported to be involved in pollen germination and growth  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit> , drought and abscisic acid -dependent signal transduction  <cit> . in the present study, unigenes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones , glycosyl , glutamate  and aspartic peptidase  were found to have different expressions in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines after high temperature stress.

with respect to the expression patterns, the unigenes involved in glycosyl, glutamate and aspartic peptidase synthesis showed up-regulation in both the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, but up-regulation was more pronounced in the heat-sensitive line. a previous study reported that the aspartic protease aspg <dig> gene in arabidopsis was significantly up-regulated and triggered the expression of downstream targets in aba signal transduction under drought conditions, which in turn promoted reactive oxygen species  production and caused oxidative damage in plant cells  <cit> . in the present study, the aspartic peptidase unigene tcons_ <dig> had a more pronounced up-regulation in the heat-sensitive than in the heat-tolerant line, which suggests that oxidative damage was more serious and led to low grain plumpness in the heat-sensitive line compared with the heat-tolerant line.

in plants, steroid hormones are involved in regulating gene expression to regulate plant growth and developmental processes such as cell elongation, photomorphogenesis and stress responses  <cit> . in the present study, the transcript  involved in steroid hormone synthesis was down-regulated in both the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines. the transcript showed more than 4-fold down-regulation in the heat-tolerant line but less than 2-fold down-regulation in the heat-sensitive line. however, the grain plumpness of the heat-sensitive line was lower than that of the heat-tolerant line under high night temperature stress, which suggests that reduced steroid hormones in plant cells may be beneficial for rice grain plumpness.

transmembrane transport of metabolic intermediates was influenced by high night temperature
transport of solutes and intermediates across cellular plasma membranes is necessary for complex metabolism. in this study, four unigenes involved in the transmembrane transport of sugar , acyl , hydrophobic molecules  and fatty acids  were found to be influenced by high night temperature stress.

for the expression pattern, the fatty acids transporter related unigene  was down-regulated in both the heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines, and the unigene showed more than  <dig> -fold greater down-regulation in the heat-tolerant line compared with the heat-sensitive line after high night temperature stress. the sugar transporter  and hydrophobic molecule transporter  showed higher expression in the heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice lines than in the controls, but up-regulation was more pronounced in the heat-sensitive line. in addition, the acyl transporter related unigene  showed a 4-fold up-regulation in the heat-sensitive line but was down-regulated in the heat-tolerant line under high night temperature stress . the results of the gene expression patterns suggest that night warming stimulates dark respiration and leads to a depletion of carbohydrates in plant cells  <cit> . however, there was greater depletion of carbohydrates in the heat-sensitive line than in the heat-tolerant line, and this resulted in a low grain plumpness in the heat-sensitive line.

hydrolysis and decarboxylization in rice cells were influenced by high temperature stress
some nudix hydrolases are reported to play regulatory roles in preventing accumulation of reactive nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, cell signaling molecules or metabolic intermediates by diverting them to metabolic pathways to maintain physiological homeostasis by sensing and modulating the levels of their substrates  <cit> . in the present study, three unigenes  involved in hydrolysis and two unigenes  involved in decarboxylization were influenced by high night temperature stress. comparing the expressed patterns of their parallel controls, the nudix hydrolase related unigene  and glycoside hydrolase related unigene  involved in hydrolysis, and the glutamate decarboxylase related unigene  involved in decarboxylization showed up-regulation in both the heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant lines. in addition, the expression of the transcript was  <dig> -fold higher in the heat-sensitive line compared with the heat-tolerant line. in contrast, the alpha/beta hydrolase related unigene  involved in hydrolysis and aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase related unigene  involved in decarboxylization were up-regulated in the heat-sensitive line but down-regulated in the heat-tolerant line. the expression patterns of the genes related to hydrolysis suggest that the disturbance of physiological homeostasis in the heat-sensitive line was greater than in the heat-tolerant line.

unknown transcripts may play an important role in rice responding to high night temperature stress
fourteen transcripts without functional annotation exhibited differentially expressed patterns between the heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant lines. interestingly, the unigene tcons_ <dig> showed more than 6-fold greater up-regulation compared with its control in the heat-tolerant line but less than 2-fold greater up-regulation in the heat-sensitive line. the unigene tcons_ <dig> was down-regulated more than 9-fold compared with its control in the heat-sensitive line but only down-regulated 3-fold in the heat-tolerant line. further, the unigene tcons_ <dig> was down-regulated more than 7-fold compared with its control in the heat-sensitive line but was only down-regulated  <dig> -fold in the heat-tolerant line. we suggest that these three unigenes may play an important role in rice response to high night temperature stress.

proposed model that regulates the expression of differentially expressed transcripts during high temperature stress in rice at the early milky stage
based on the functions of the differentially expressed htrts, we proposed a possible mechanism under which these unigenes function in response to heat shock in the plant cell . initially, heat shock influenced the enzyme  activities involved in electron transport under normal conditions, and disrupted electron transport from the intramembrane to the extramembrane in mitochondria, including the electron transport chains from nadp-nad+ to fmn, fad to ubiquinol-q, and ubiquinol-q to oxygen forming water, which led to changes in the concentration of the hydrogen ion in the mitochondrial and cellular matrix. in the mitochondrial matrix, the activities of the transporter for acyl-coa , glycoside hydrolase activities  and glutamate decarboxylase activities  were influenced by changes in the concentration of the hydrogen ion, which influenced the metabolism of oxaloacetic acid and citric acid, and further affected the metabolism of succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle . the disruption of the metabolism of succinate to fumarate may result in feedback regulation of electron transport from the tca to the mitochondrial membrane. in the cellular matrix, the electron transport chain from no3− to nh4+ was also influenced by changes in the hydrogen ion concentration. according to our proposed model and the different expression patterns of the unigenes related to electron transfer, oxidation, hydrolase activities, depletion of carbohydrates and the production of metabolic intermediates involved in physiological homeostasis, it suggested that a high night temperature resulted in a more pronounced up-regulation and increased depletion of carbohydrates in the heat-sensitive line than in the heat-tolerant line, which led to lower carbohydrate accumulation and resulted in a low grain plumpness in the heat-sensitive line.

comparing our previous results from transcriptome  <cit>  and proteomics  <cit>  studies in rice responding to high temperature stress , we suggest that high temperature may mainly affect the expression of genes related to oxidation, while a high night temperature could exert a major influence on the expression of genes related to the electron transport from the intramembrane to the extramembrane of mitochondria in rice grains at the early milky stage.

CONCLUSIONS
using illumina sequencing technology, the differences in the transcriptomes of heat-sensitive and -tolerant rice lines in response to high night temperature stress at the early milky stage are described here for the first time. the candidate transcripts may provide genetic resources for the improvement of heat-tolerant characters in rice. the proposed model, which is based on transcription expression differences between two rice lines, may facilitate future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying high night temperature responses in plants.
