BACKGROUND
the ciliate protozoan ichthyophthirius multifiliis is one of the most devastating pathogens. it infects fish skin and gills, and causes white spot diseases in many species of freshwater fish worldwide, which leads to significant losses in the aquaculture industry. the ciliate parasite has three main life-cycle stages: the reproductive tomont, the infective theront, and a parasitic trophont  <cit> . the mature trophont drops off the host to become the tomont where it attaches to a substrate, and undergoes multiple divisions to produce hundreds to thousands of tomites within a cyst. tomites bore their way through the cyst into water, and differentiate into theronts that infect fish. once they burrow into the fish epithelium, theronts become trophonts that feed and mature in the host.

in spite of great losses caused by ich to the aquaculture industry, molecular studies of the parasite have been scarce . limited studies have concentrated on immune responses of the host and factors affecting them  <cit> . one of the difficulties for the studies of ich is the problem involved in long-term maintenance of ich isolates. ich isolates appear to lose infectivity or become senescent after a certain number of passages  <cit> . most often a significant decrease in infectivity is observed after about  <dig> passages  <cit> . not only the infectivity decreases with higher numbers of passages, but also the development of the parasite as measured by the period required for trophonts to emerge from fish  <cit> .

the ich senescence phenomenon is interesting not only as a developmental biology issue, but also as a potential research system to study the virulence factors involved in the parasite pathogenesis. assuming the life cycles of ich and its infectivity are controlled by gene products, then it would be of great interest to learn what genes are involved in the loss of infectivity, and in the slowing down of its development. however, as very limited molecular information is available from ich, in-depth research is limited by the lack of information and the lack of genomic resources.

est analysis is one of the most effective means for gene discoveries, gene expression profiling, and functional genome studies  <cit> . it is also one of the most efficient ways for the identification of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . in order to provide genomic resources for the analysis of differentially expressed genes at different developmental stages of the ich parasite, and for the analysis of genes differentially expressed when infectivity is being lost, the objectives of this study were to create cdna libraries suitable for the analysis of expressed sequence tags  and to generate an est resource for ich to allow cdna-based design of microarrays for the study of gene expression in relation to the passages and development of the parasite. before this work, there were only  <dig> ich sequences in the genbank dbest   <cit> . a brief examination of these existing est sequences indicated that a large proportion of them were trophont only reads, histones, ribosomal proteins, and immobilization antigen-related sequences. here we report sequencing of  <dig>  ich est clones, and generation of  <dig>  high quality est sequences. this est resource should provide the material basis for the development of microarrays for ich, and serve as a platform for its functional genomic studies including the development and pathogenesis of ich, and the host-parasite interactions.

RESULTS
generation of the ich ests
as summarized in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced from a normalized ich library made from pooled cells from all three life cycle stages: theront, tomont, and trophont. readable sequences were generated with  <dig>  clones . after base calling, sequences were processed by using phred  <cit>  to eliminate low quality sequences below q <dig>  sequences passing q <dig> were uploaded into vector nti advance  <dig>  for vector trimming and removal of sequences with very short inserts . the post-sequencing processing resulted in  <dig>  high quality sequences.

1percentage of high quality sequences from successful sequences; 2percentage of unique sequences of the high quality sequences; 3percentage of unique sequences

the processed sequences were subjected to cluster analysis using vector nti to evaluate sequence redundancies. of the  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  sequences fell within  <dig> contigs while  <dig>  sequences were singletons. on average, each contig contained  <dig>  sequences. taken together, the  <dig> contigs and the  <dig>  singletons made up  <dig>  unique sequences .

the ich genome expression appeared to be extremely polarized with a few genes expressed at very high levels. in spite of normalization, transcripts from a few genes were sequenced at very high frequencies. the top  <dig> contigs with the largest number of ests are summarized in table  <dig>  of the top  <dig> most abundantly sequenced transcripts, four of them were detected over  <dig> % of total sequences. of these, the most abundantly sequenced est cluster, cluster  <dig> with  <dig> ests, accounted for  <dig> % of all sequenced clones. blastx searches indicated that this transcript was most similar to a hypothetical protein, ttherm_ <dig>  from tetrahymena thermophila. the second most abundantly sequenced transcript was cluster  <dig> with  <dig> ests. it was identified as a transcript most similar to a hypothetical protein, ttherm_ <dig>  from t. thermophila. the functions of these hypothetical proteins are unknown at present. these are two transcripts sequenced at exceptionally high frequencies. obviously, the presence of such abundant transcripts suggested a failure in the normalization processes. however, it is puzzling to us because we believe the overall normalization processes may have worked based on several other observations: 1) the overall gene discovery rate  was  <dig> %, a reasonable rate for the sequencing depth of approximately  <dig>  clones; 2) most other anticipated highly expressed genes such as ribosomal protein genes, actin genes, tubulin genes, and dynein genes were not detected at high levels. nonetheless, we believe that this information is relevant and important as these genes should be the subject for additional subtraction for further est sequencing in this species. in addition, such information should provide some basic picture about the most abundantly expressed genes in the parasite. as these hypothetical protein genes are transcribed at such high levels, they may be crucially important for the growth and development, or other life-cycle processes of the parasite.

this work demonstrated that pooling of samples from all three stages of ich life cycle followed by normalization was an effective way to reduce common messages across all three life stages. as one would expect, many structural genes would be expressed highly abundantly in all stages of the life cycle. in addition to making savings economically, pooling of samples allowed very effective normalization of these common transcripts without going through three rounds of normalization. this is consistent with our previous experience for the generation of a large number of catfish and oyster ests  <cit> . it is obvious that the pooling of samples from three developmental stages made it impossible to provide information concerning expression profiling in relation to developmental stages. however, such information would not be highly meaningful in normalized cdna libraries where the major focus was to develop est resources, rather than expression profiling. the other limitation caused by construction of a pooled cdna library is the loss of sequencing flexibility as to the number of clones to be sequenced from each developmental stage library if they had been separately constructed.

the ich transcribed sequences are highly a/t-rich, similar to the situation in t. thermophila. our unique sequences combined contain  <dig>  megabases, approximately 10% of the genomic sequence size of the related protozoan plasmodium falciparum, and  <dig> % of the t. thermophila genomic sequence. as ich is a ciliate and most closely related to tetrahymena, this est resource should represent a good sample of the transcribed fraction of the ich genome for the estimation of its genome contents as compared with tetrahymena. based on the est sequences, the average g+c content of ich transcribed sequences was found to be  <dig> %, even more a/t-rich than those of the closely related hymenostome t. thermophila, which has an average g+c content of 38% at protein coding regions  <cit> . the entire genome of t. thermophila was much more a/t-rich than the transcribed fraction, with a g+c content of only 22%  <cit> . it is highly probable that the ich genome is also highly a/t-rich. to further the analysis, we found approximately 1% of the unique ests sequenced contained simple sequence repeats. the majority of the simple sequence repeats were of di-nucleotide repeats  with ac and ag repeats being the majority. tri-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the identified microsatellites, respectively .

the putative identities of the sequenced ests were assessed using blastx searches against the non-redundant  database in genbank  <cit> . all the search results are summarized in supplemental table  <dig>  of the  <dig>  unique ests,  <dig>   had significant  hits. the remaining  <dig>   est sequences were not similar to any known sequences. additional searches using the swiss-prot database resulted in putative identities for six additional unknown ests .

identification of putative secretory proteins
secretory proteins have been shown to be an important component in many biological processes, including pathogenesis of parasites  <cit> . we therefore searched for transcripts with putative signal peptides  within the est set using the program signalp  <dig>   <cit> . we found  <dig> ests with signal peptides, representing  <dig> % of the unique sequences. of these,  <dig>  were from ests with no significant  blastx hit to the nr database in genbank .

comparative analysis to related taxa
the parasite ich is phylogenetically placed between the protozoan's plasmodium falciparum and tetrahymena thermophila. previous studies using 18s rdna, histone genes, and i-antigens  <cit>  suggested that ich was more related to t. thermophila than to p. falciparum. furthermore, t. thermophila and ich share the ciliate nuclear genetic code, while p. falciparum uses the standard genetic code for translation. as the entire genome sequence of p. falciparum is available and the macronuclear sequencing project of t. thermophila was just recently completed, we made comparative blast analyses against both genome sequences.

the tblastx or blastx searches of ich ests against the t. thermophila and p. falciparum genomes are summarized in supplemental table  <dig>  and are presented in figure  <dig>  as expected based on the phylogenetic relationships, more ich ests were similar to the genome sequences of t. thermophila than to that of p. falciparum. of the  <dig>  ich ests,  <dig>  sequences were similar  to the t. thermophila genome sequences; whereas  <dig> were similar to the p. falciparum genome sequences. in total,  <dig> ests were similar to both t. thermophila and p. falciparum genomes, and thus are common to all three protists.

of the  <dig>  significant hits against the t. thermophila genome,  <dig>  had been identified with a putative identity using blastx searches against the nr database, while the tblastx searches against the t. thermophila genome allowed identification of putative identities for additional  <dig> unique ests. similarly, blastx searches against the p. falciparum genome allowed identification of  <dig> additional ests. taken together, the blast searches against these two genomes allowed putative identities of  <dig> additional unique ests, bringing the total number of ests with significant similarities to known genes to  <dig> .

such genome searches also revealed that of the  <dig>  ests that had significant hits in blastx searches against the nr database,  <dig> had no significant hits to the tetrahymena genome. clearly, these ests were similar to sequences of organisms other than the ciliate tetrahymena.

these results clearly suggest conservation of a large fraction of gene sequences among the three protozoa parasites, with a higher level of conservation between ich and the t. thermophila genome than between the ich genome and the p. falciparum genome; although a significant fraction of gene sequences are also shared between the genomes of t. thermophila and p. falciparum. the results of this comparative analysis are compatible with existing phylogenetic analyses using several molecular markers such as the 18s rdna, histone genes, and the i-antigens. obviously, use of a large set of sequences should provide a greater confidence concerning genome evolution. the comparative analysis suggested that the est resource generated from this study should be useful for phylogenetic analysis and studies concerning genome evolution.

gene ontology
the unique ich sequences were compared to annotations through the gene ontology consortium  <cit>  using the automated software blast2go  <cit> . we were able to obtain go terms for  <dig>  unique sequences using this method. of these,  <dig> were contigs and  <dig> were singletons. sequence descriptions, gene ontology  and enzyme commission  numbers are summarized in supplemental table  <dig>  there were  <dig> sequences with both go terms and ec numbers.

gene ontology graphs using percentages of 2nd level go terms are presented in figure  <dig> under the categories of cellular components , molecular functions , and biological processes . of the cellular component go terms, 45% and 26% were related directly with cellular and organelle components, respectively. in the category of molecular functions, the vast majority were involved in catalytic activity  and binding activities . under the category of biological processes, 45% were involved in physiological processes; 43% were involved in cellular processes, 6% in regulation of biological processes, 4% in response to stimuli, and 2% in development .

CONCLUSIONS
we have produced  <dig>  high quality i. multifiliis est sequences. sequence analysis indicated the presence of  <dig>  unique sequences in the est set. this should represent a significant fraction of the ich genes, although the exact gene number of the parasite is unknown at present. the majority of the unique est sequences had similarities to known genes, making them more amenable to functional analysis. the est sequences should enhance the effectiveness of molecular studies, especially for gene expression profiling and the analysis of genes involved in virulence and infectivity. microarrays can now be designed using either cdna microarray or oligo-based platforms using the est information. additionally, the cluster and redundancy information should be useful for further subtraction of the most abundant transcripts included in the cdna library, making further est analysis in the parasite more effective.
