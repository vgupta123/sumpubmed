BACKGROUND
pollen, as the male gametophyte, participates in sexual reproduction in angiosperms and influences seed yield and quality. pollen development is one of the most fascinating and critical processes that are critical for successful reproduction in the life cycle of flowering plants  <cit> . by employing a variety of resources and novel techniques, scientists have made significant progress in pollen research toward a deeper understanding of pollen development. in  <dig>  the phytohormone brassinosteroid was verified to control male fertility by regulating the expression of key genes involved in arabidopsis anther and pollen development, such as spl/nzz, ems1/exs, dyt <dig>  tdf <dig>  atmyb <dig>  ams, ms <dig>  and ms <dig> <cit> . honys and twell conducted a genome-wide study on pollen transcriptome in arabidopsis based on microarray analysis. over  <dig> genes were predicted to be expressed in pollen, out of which more than  <dig> genes were pollen-specific  <cit> . a large-scale genetic screen was conducted in arabidopsis, and a number of genes were identified to be involved in pollen exine production, including fatty acid ω-hydroxylase cyp704b <dig>  putative glycosyl transferases at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  4-coumarate-coenzyme a ligase 4cl <dig>  and polygalacturonase quartet <dig> <cit> . until now, a series of genes which were successively renamed brassica campestris male fertile   <dig> <cit> , bcmf <dig> <cit> , bcmf <dig> <cit> , up to bcmf <dig> <cit> , have been demonstrated to be involved in pollen development in brassica campestris. for example, among these genes, one type was polygalacturonase gene, which participated in pollen extine or intine development, such as bcmf <dig> <cit> , bcmf <dig> <cit> , and bcmf <dig> <cit> . these previous studies provide important information for understanding the gene regulatory networks of pollen development. however, the mechanisms that underlie pollen development remain unclear, and further studies must be conducted.

mirnas are a newly identified class of endogenous non-coding small rnas that have become a research hotspot because of their negative regulatory function in gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by degrading target mrnas or repressing gene translation. numerous studies have previously shown that mirnas have important functions in regulating a wide range of plant developmental processes, including lateral root development  <cit> , leaf development and polarity  <cit> , vegetative phase change  <cit> , flowering time and floral organ identity  <cit> , plant nutrient homeostasis  <cit> , signal transmission  <cit> , and response to environmental biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . among mirnas that are known to function in a variety of plant development processes, few mirnas in pollen tissue have been reported. wei et al. identified  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in oryza sativa. a total of  <dig> out of the  <dig> known mirnas were enriched in developing pollen, and more than half of the  <dig> novel mirnas displayed pollen- or stage-specific expression  <cit> . with the use of microarray, chambers and shuai detected  <dig> mirnas which showed significant differences in expression between mature pollen and inflorescence in arabidopsis. they confirmed the expression of  <dig> mirnas in mature pollen by using real-time pcr, with most of mirnas being expressed in low abundance  <cit> . grant-downton et al. detected  <dig> different microrna families in mature pollen, and several showed pollen-enriched expression compared with leaves, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated the existence of mirnas in pollen or inflorescence. however, studies must be conducted to investigate whether mirnas participate in the pollen development and to determine their corresponding functions.

in this study, two small rna libraries were constructed from the flower buds of the sterile line bcajh97-01a  and the fertile line bcajh97-01b  plants. a total of  <dig> known mirnas were detected,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> pairs of novel mirna/mirna* were identified. meanwhile,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were identified by comparing their expression abundances in the two libraries. results from qrt-pcr agreed with those from high-throughput sequencing. to search for the target genes of identified mirnas, degradome sequencing was conducted with the inflorescences of the b line plants. a total of  <dig> targets were predicted to be cleaved by seven mirnas. our study provides clues to explore mirna group involved in pollen development and the interactions between mirnas and their targets.

RESULTS
analysis of small rna library data sets and the small rna profile
to identify mirnas involved in pollen development in the male sterile line ‘bcajh97-01a’ and the male fertile line ‘bcajh97-01b’, two independent small rna libraries from the flower buds collected from the two lines were sequenced by using illumina solexa high-throughput sequencing technology. the two libraries generated a total of  <dig> and  <dig> raw reads, respectively . the raw reads of the two libraries were uploaded to sra database of ncbi and two accession numbers were obtained, which were srx <dig> and srx <dig>  after removing the reads because 3adt was not found, reads < <dig> bases, and junk reads,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences were obtained with lengths that range from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, respectively. after further filtering the rfam  and repbase sequences, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mappable small rna sequences, respectively, were obtained . the length distributions of small rnas were very similar between the two libraries . in general, the majority of the small rnas ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt in size. the  <dig> nt small rnas in total sequence reads were the most dominant, followed by  <dig> nt small rnas .

identification of known mirnas
to identify known mirnas in brassica campestris, all mappable small rna sequences were compared with the known plant mirnas in the mirbase database. a total of  <dig> small rnas that have the same sequences with the known bra-mirnas in mirbase were identified . the numbers of reads of the  <dig> known mirnas in the two small rna libraries from flower buds of a line and b line are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> among the  <dig> known mirnas, bra-mir159a, bra-mir160a-5p, bra-mir171e, bra-mir1885b, and bra-mir <dig> showed very high expression levels.

novel mirna on the other arm of known pre-mirna
the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has given rise to the discovery that a great number of mirnas and mirnas* are simultaneously present on two arms of pre-mirna secondary structures. mirna and mirna* are renamed mirna-3p or mirna-5p, which indicates their locations in the 5′ arm or 3′ arm of pre-mirna secondary structures. through high-throughput sequencing, eight novel mirnas on the other arm of known pre-mirnas were identified. mirna sequences and the corresponding number of reads in flower buds of the a line and b line are listed in table  <dig> 

identification of new conserved mirna families and new mirna members
to identify conserved mirnas in brassica campestris, all mappable small rnas were mapped to the brassica campestris genome sequences and known plant mirnas in mirbase. if the small rnas can exactly map to brassica campestris genome sequences and can also match known plant mirnas with no more than three mismatches, these small rnas were classified as candidate conserved mirnas. five criteria described in the materials and methods were mainly used to strictly screen the candidate conserved mirnas. as a result,  <dig> mirnas  that belong to  <dig> families were identified . these  <dig> mirnas have not been previously reported as bra-mirnas in mirbase and show high sequence similarity to some of the known plant mirnas. most of these mirnas were  <dig> nt long, with only few mirnas having lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> nt; this characteristic is common in most plant species. for the bra-mir <dig> family, eight members were obtained by using deep sequencing. two family members  of bra-mir <dig> were identified. two pairs of mirnas that belong to bra-mir168a, with one pair being bra-mir168a-1-p <dig> and bra-mir168a-1-p <dig>  the other pair being bra-mir168a-2-p <dig> and bra-mir162a-2-p <dig>  were identified. the two pairs of bra-mir168a shared the same mature sequences. however, they were from different precursors, i.e., they came from different loci of the brassica campestris genome. the two precursor sequences of bra-mir168a were highly similar with each other. these two pairs of mirnas were called sub-members. this type of sub-member was also observed in the bra-mir <dig> family. four sub-members  were identified for bra-mir395a. this phenomenon suggests that some highly similar mirna gene might be produced by a replication event from one origin sequence to another one, which results in more copies of the mirna group. except the abovementioned three mirna families, only one mirna member was identified for the rest of mirna family. at the same time, six new mirna members that belonged to three known mirna families were discovered in the two small rna libraries .

identification of novel mirnas
to predict novel mirnas in brassica campestris, all the mappable small rnas were blasted to the brassica campestris genome sequence in brassica database and plant known mirnas in mirbase. the small rnas that exactly map to the genome sequence but not the plant known mirnas were classified as candidate novel mirnas. to increase predictive accuracy, five criteria described in the materials and methods were mainly used to search for novel mirnas. novel mirnas were discovered in pairs since the mirna/mirna* criterion was used. as a result,  <dig> pairs of novel mirnas/mirna* that belong to  <dig> mirna families were identified in this study . the bra-mirn <dig> had two sub-members , as well as bra-mirn <dig> . the lengths of mature mirnas were distributed in the range of  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt. the mfe of these predicted pre-mirnas ranged from -37 kcal/mol to - <dig>  kcal/mol. the mfei ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> , which is consistent with the characteristics of mirna. most of these novel mirnas were expressed in the flower buds of the a line and b line, but the expression levels were very low. bra-mirn22-3p showed obviously high expression abundance in the flower buds of the a line and b line, which was considerably higher than expression levels of other mirnas. the information about the numbers of reads and the sequence characteristics of all the identified mirnas by using high-throughput sequencing are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the hairpin structures for precursors of bra-mirn <dig> and bra-mirn10- <dig> are used as examples in figure  <dig>

expression profiling of differentially expressed mirnas in the flower buds of a line and b line
throughout all the identified conserved and novel mirnas,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with more than two-fold relative change between the flower buds of a line and b line were identified in high-throughput sequencing . the relative expression level was calculated based on the normalized number of sequence reads of these mirnas in small rna libraries from flower buds of a line and b line. among the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated in flower buds of the b line. the remaining three mirnas  showed higher expression levels in the flower buds of a line than in the b line . for all  <dig> mirnas enriched in flower buds of the b line, bra-mir824-p <dig> showed the highest relative expression level . for the three mirnas enriched in flower buds of the a line, the differential expression of bra-mir168a-p <dig> was the most obvious . qrt-pcr was conducted to verify the expression profile of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in deep sequencing. the results of qrt-pcr largely agreed with the deep sequencing results . in qrt-pcr, two more mirnas  were found to be up-regulated in the b line, which were enriched in the a line based on deep sequencing analysis. bra-mir390a-p <dig> was also up-regulated in the a line based on qrt-pcr analysis. in addition, expression profiles of these  <dig> mirnas were presented in terms of the number of reads in flower buds of the a line and b line libraries . the number of normalized reads of bra-mir159a was very high, followed by bra-mir160a-5p, p-bra-mir319b-p <dig>  and bra-mir168a-p <dig>  p-bra-mir319b-p <dig> was predicted to be the 3′ arm mirna of bra-mir319b. for all the identified mirnas in this study, 5′ arm and 3′ arm mirnas, namely, mirna and mirna*, were both detected, except for p-bra-mir319b-p <dig>  therefore, a “p” was added to bra-mir319b-p <dig>  which denotes “predicted”. the two members of bra-mir <dig> family, namely, bra-mir168a-p <dig> and bra-mir168b-p <dig>  were both up-regulated in flower buds of the b line. bra-mir824-p <dig> and bra-mir <dig> were consistently up-regulated in flower buds of the b line, which indicates that different members can have similar expression patterns.

identification of mirna target genes in brassica campestris by using degradome analysis
target identification of the mirnas is important to further understand the potential regulatory role and biological function of a mirna. in this study, degradome sequencing was used to search for the target genes of identified mirnas in brassica campestris. a total of  <dig> targets were predicted to be cleaved by seven mirnas . the seven mirnas were bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig>  and bra-mirn <dig>  bra-mir <dig> was identified in this study and was found to be highly conserved in plant species. three targets that encode squamosa promoter binding protein  transcription factors were identified for bra-mir <dig>  bra-mir <dig> and bra-mir <dig> were highly conserved mirnas. they respectively targeted three and two transcription factors that belong to myb domain protein family and ap2-like factor, respectively. bra-mir <dig> and bra-mir <dig> were both cruciferae-specific mirnas. bra-mir <dig> was identified in the present deep sequencing analysis and was found to target two pentatricopeptide repeat -containing protein family genes. bra-mir <dig> is a known mirna, which was predicted to cleave an agamous-like transcription factor. bra-mir <dig> is a known mirna that is only reported in brassica campestris and might be specific only to brassica. bra-mir <dig> was predicted to target two genes encoding disease resistance protein . bra-mirn <dig> is a novel mirna that was predicted to cleave two genes that encode unknown proteins. most of the identified targets are generally homologous to target genes found in arabidopsis . unfortunately, for most mirnas identified through deep sequencing, including conserved mirnas and novel mirnas, their target genes could not be detected in the present degradome analysis. in the above analysis,  <dig> target genes were identified for seven mirna families. among the  <dig> targets, nine were transcription factors. for each mirna family, one target was chosen and a t-plot was constructed . in t-plots, the cleavage site for each mirna:mrna alignment is shown. the t-plots for the remaining eight targets are illustrated in additional file 3: figure s <dig>

discussion
characteristics of conserved and non-conserved mirnas in plants
in plants, many mirnas seems to be universally expressed among diverse angiosperms, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and so on. among them, a small number of mirnas have also been detected in bryophyte, lycopod, gymnosperm, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  <cit> . however, there are a large number of mirnas which are just present in a few species, even in only one species. for example, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> have only been detected in arabidopsis and oryza sativa <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> have just been identified in brassica campestris <cit> . considering that some mirnas are widespread, while others distribute in limited plant species, mirnas are classified into two categories, ‘conserved’ mirnas and ‘non-conserved’ mirnas. in previous reports, the term ‘conserved’ mirnas are mainly used when the mirnas are present throughout at least one major ancient clade of land plants, for example angiosperms. ‘non-conserved’ mirnas are defined as those with a limited phylogenetic distribution and characterized by primarily being single-copy genes  <cit> . in present years, with the development of high-throughput sequencing, a high proportion of non-conserved mirnas have been identified in many species, such as larch  <cit> , populus euphratica <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and soybean  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> conserved mirna families, which had not been previously reported in brassica campestris but reported in other plant species, were identified. meanwhile,  <dig> pairs of novel mirna/mirna* were identified according to strict mirna/mirna* identification criteria. they are likely to be brassica campestris-specific mirnas, of course which are classified into non-conserved mirnas.

previous reports have indicated that non-conserved mirnas are often species specific, weakly expressed, and encoded by single loci  <cit> , while highly conserved mirnas are widespread, highly expressed, and most of them have more than one family member  <cit> .our results were just in accord with the previous results. in our study, the numbers of reads of the  <dig> pairs of novel mirna/mirna* were extremely low, except for bra-mirn22-3p. most of their read numbers were less than  <dig>  however, the read numbers of the conserved mirnas were very high. most of their read numbers were more than  <dig>  bra-mir <dig> had the highest number of reads, which was close to  <dig>  a similar phenomenon was also observed in arabidopsis lyrata <cit> . in addition, in our study, except for bra-mirn <dig> and bra-mirn <dig> families, only one member was identified for the rest of  <dig> novel mirna families, while most of the conserved mirna families have more than two family members. our results indicates that compared with conserved mirnas, most of the novel mirnas were encoded by a single locus., which was consistent with the previous study  <cit> . in general, all of the previous studies and our results verify that conserved and non-conserved mirnas present nearly opposite characters. as for why they show so different characters, more research on evolution and functional diversification of mirna genes will be helpful to elucidate it.

diverse mirnas are present in pollen and they are possibly involved in pollen development
previous studies have demonstrated that many mirnas exist in arabidopsis mature pollen. in  <dig>  grant-downton et al. detected  <dig> known mirnas in arabidopsis pollen by using  <dig> sequencing technology  <cit> . in the same year, chambers and shuai verified that many mirnas are expressed in the pollen and inflorescences of arabidopsis using mirna array  <cit> . many studies have also been conducted in rice. in  <dig>  wei et al. used deep sequencing technology to analyze the composition and expression patterns of mirnas in developing pollen of rice, including uninucleate microspores, bicellular pollen and tricellular pollen, as well as sporophytic tissues. a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were detected. among the  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> were enriched in developing pollen and more than half of the novel mirnas displayed pollen- or stage-specific expression. these pollen- or stage-specific mirnas might function during pollen development process  <cit> . in our study, we identified  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> conserved mirnas, and  <dig> pairs of novel mirna/mirna* in flower buds of the a line and b line plants. among all these mirnas,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with more than two-fold relative change between flower buds of a line and b line were identified. moreover, most of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were up-regulated in flower buds of b line. we speculate that these mirnas might be involved in pollen development process. previous studies and the present study demonstrate that diverse mirnas exist in plant pollen and they might have potential regulatory roles in pollen development.

in  <dig>  grant-downton et al. demonstrated that several mainly srna pathway genes, including ago family members, dcl1- <dig>  hasty, serrate, hen <dig>  and rdr family members, were expressed in unicellular microspores, bicellular pollen, tricellualr pollen, and mature pollen grains in arabidopsis by rt-pcr analysis. at the same time, they succeeded in amplifying the pri-mirnas, pre-mirnas, and mature mirnas from mature pollen cdna, which verified that mirna synthesis in pollen was going on as usual  <cit> . their results further verify that mirnas are not only present in pollen, but also may participate in the complex regulatory network of pollen development.

the application of degradome analysis have massively accelerated the research on the interactions of mirnas and their target genes
identification of target genes is the first and essential step to understand the regulatory roles of mirnas. in plants, most mirnas can perfectly or almost perfectly bind to their target mrnas. thus, bioinformatics prediction is a common approach for predicting mirna target genes. in recent years, many computational tools have been developed for predicting plant mirna targets, such as psrnatarget  <cit> , target-align  <cit> , tapir  <cit> , and pmrd  <cit> . 5′-modified race is frequently used to demonstrate mirna targets. this method is easy to operate, and the results are reliable. however, 5′-modified race is based on the premise that the candidate target is already predicted and its mrna sequence is known for primer design. 5′-modified race is not efficient for identifying a large number of candidate target genes. fortunately, in recent years, degradome sequencing analysis  <cit> , a new method for massively identifying target genes, is increasingly being developed for such applications. the application of this new method greatly accelerates the detection of mirna targets.

in recent years, degradome sequencing has been used for large-scale target identification in many species, such as populus euphratica <cit> , soybean  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , and brassica juncea <cit> . in the present study, degradome sequencing was performed and finally a large number of candidate target genes were detected. in order to confirm the reliable candidate targets, two criteria described in the materials and methods were mainly used. finally, a total of  <dig> targets were chosen and predicted to be cleaved by seven mirna families. nine of the  <dig> targets were transcription factors. they were squamosa promoter binding  transcription factors , myb transcription factors , ap2-like transcription factors , agamous-like transcription factors , which were targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> families, respectively. these target genes have been reported playing an important role in plant growth and development. mir <dig>  which targets ap2-like transcription factors, has been implicated in the regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity in maize and arabidopsis <cit> . in  <dig>  wu et al. indicated that mir <dig> and mir <dig> regulated the development transition from juvenile to adult  <cit> . in the next year, xing et al. concluded that fully fertile arabidopsis flowers required the action of multiple mir156/7-targeted spl genes in concert with spl <dig>  otherwise semi-sterile or fully sterile would emerge  <cit> . the results suggested that mir156/ <dig> and their targets, namely sbp transcription factors, might participate in gametophyte development. mir <dig> and its target genes, namely myb-like genes, were proved to inhibit growth and promote programmed cell death in arabidopsis <cit> . in addition to targeting transcription factors, the remaining  <dig> target genes were also shown to be involved in other biological processes. for example, mir <dig> and its two targets were involved in disease resistance  <cit> . mir <dig> and bra-mirn <dig> both had two candidate target genes and their functions in plants were unknown yet. in summary, degradome analysis has greatly accelerated the identification of mirna targets. meanwhile, it speeds up the research on mirna/target interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a large number of mirnas were identified in brassica campestris ssp. chinensis, including  <dig> novel mirnas on the other arm of known pre-mirnas,  <dig> conserved mirna families,  <dig> new mirna members that belong to  <dig> known mirna families, and  <dig> pairs of novel mirna/mirna*. meanwhile, by analyzing the sequencing reads of mirnas, we found that there were <dig> mirnas differentially expressed between the flower buds of a line and b line, and  <dig> of them were up-regulated in flower buds of b line. this result was validated by using qrt-pcr analysis. by using degradome sequencing, a total of  <dig> targets were identified for  <dig> mirna families, which reveal interaction between mirnas and targets. in a word, the identification of plenty of mirnas has greatly enriched the existing mirna group in brassica campestris. more importantly, the present study might provide valuable clues for exploring mirna-mediated regulatory networks during pollen development.
