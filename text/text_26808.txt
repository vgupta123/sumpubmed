BACKGROUND
non-coding rna  plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation, cellular function and defense, and disease. indeed, in higher eukaryotes, most of the genomic dna sequence encodes non-protein-coding transcripts  <cit> . in contrast to protein-coding mrnas, ncrnas do not form a homogeneous class. the best-characterized subclasses form stable basepairing patterns  that are crucial for their function. this group includes the well-known trnas, catalytically active rnas such as rrna, snrnas, rnase p rna, and other ribozymes, and regulatory rnas such as micrornas and spliceosomal rnas that direct protein complexes to specific rna targets. much less is known about long mrna-like ncrnas, which are typically poorly conserved at the level of both sequence and structure.

most non-vertebrate genome projects have put little emphasis on a comprehensive annotation of ncrnas. indeed, most non-coding rnas, with the notable exception of trnas and rrnas, are difficult or impossible to detect with blast in phylogenetically distant organisms. hence, ncrna annotation is not part of generic genome annotation pipelines. dedicated computational searches for particular ncrnas, for example, rnase p and mrp  <cit> , 7sk rnas  <cit> , or telomerase rna  <cit> , are veritable research projects in their own right. despite best efforts, ncrnas across the animal phylogeny remain to a large extent uncharted territory.

the main difficulty with ncrna annotation is poor sequence conservation and indel patterns that often correspond to large additional "expansion domains". in many cases, the secondary structure is much better conserved than the primary sequence, providing a means of confirming candidate ncrnas even in cases where sequence conservation is confined to a few characteristic motifs. secondary structure conservation can also be utilized to detect homologs of some ncrnas based on characteristic combinations of sequence and structure motifs using special software tools designed for this purpose.

in  <cit>  we described a protocol for a more detailed homology-based ncrna annotation than what can be achieved with currently available automatic pipelines. here, we apply this scheme to the genome of s. mansoni, and by comparison with the newly sequenced s. japonicum genome, identify ncrnas in both of these clinically important schistosomes.

schistosomes belong to an early-diverging group within the digenea, but are clearly themselves highly derived  <cit> . the flatworms are a long-branch group, suggesting rapid mutation rates .

schistosome genomes are comparatively large, estimated to be over  <dig> megabase pairs, and perhaps as high as  <dig> megabase pairs, for the haploid genome of s. mansoni and s. japonicum  <cit> . the other major schistosome species parasitizing humans probably have a genome of similar size, based on the similarity in appearance of their karyotypes  <cit> . these large sizes may be characteristic of platyhelminth genomes in general: the genome of schmidtea mediterranea is even larger, with the current genome sequencing project reporting a size of ~ <dig> million base pairs  <cit> http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/schmidtea_mediterranea/.

genome sequencing of the seven autosomes and the pair of sex chromosomes of s. mansoni with about 8× coverage has lead to a genome assembly comprising  <dig>  scaffolds  covering  <dig> mb  <cit> . similarly, shotgun sequencing of s. japonicum with coverage of  <dig> × decoded  <dig> mb of sequence  <cit> . these form about  <dig>  scaffolds. albeit both genome projects did not lead to complete finished genomes, we therefore know at least 90-95% of the genomic dna sequences of s. japonicum and s. mansoni, respectively.

the protein-coding portion of the schistosoma genomes have received much attention in recent years. published work includes transcriptome databases for both s. japonicum  <cit>  and s. mansoni  <cit> , microarray-based expression analysis  <cit> , characterization of promoters  <cit> , and physical mapping and annotation of protein-coding genes from both the s. mansoni and s. japonicum genome projects  <cit> . recently, a systematic annotation of protein-coding genes in s. japonicum was reported  <cit> . in contrast to other, better-understood, parasites such as plasmodium  <cit> , however, not much is known about the non-coding rna complement of schistosomes. only the spliced leader rna  of s. mansoni  <cit> , the hammer-head ribozymes encoded by the sine-like retrotransposons sm-α and sj-α  <cit> , and secondary structure elements in the ltr retrotransposon boudicca  <cit>  have received closer attention. ribosomal rna sequences have been available mostly for phylogenetic purposes  <cit> , and trnas have been studied to a limited degree  <cit> .

the wealth of available ests, in principle, provides a valuable resource for ncrna detection. since mostly poly-a ests have been generated, it is not surprising that most ests have been attributed to protein-coding genes  <cit> . the large evolutionary distance, with 55% of the genes without homologs outside the genus  <cit> , makes it hard or even impossible to reliably distinguish ests of putative mrna-like ncrnas from non-coding portions of protein-coding transcripts.

in this contribution we therefore focus on a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary conserved non-coding rnas in the genomes of s. mansoni and s. japonicum. we discuss representatives of  <dig> types of ncrnas that were detected based on both sequence and secondary structure homology.

RESULTS
structure and homology-based searches of the schistosome genomes revealed ncrnas from  <dig> different rna categories. table  <dig> lists these functional ncrna categories, the number of predicted genes in each category, and references associated with each rna type. supplementary fasta files containing the ncrna genes, bed files with the genome annotation, and stockholm-format alignment files can be accessed at http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/publications/supplements/08- <dig> 

 where are range of numbers is given, it remains uncertain whether multiple copies in the genomic dna are true copies of the gene or assembly artifacts.

transfer rnas
candidate trnas were predicted with trnascan-se in the genomes of s. mansoni, s. japonicum and s. mediterranea . after removal of transposable element sequences , trnascan-se predicted a total of  <dig> trnas for s. mansoni and  <dig> for s. mediterranea, while  <dig> trnas were found in the s. japonicum sequences. these included trnas encoding the standard  <dig> amino acids of the traditional genetic code, selenocysteine encoding trnas   <cit>  and possible suppressor trnas  <cit>  in all three genomes. the trnasec from schistosomes has been characterized, and is similar in both size and structure to trnasec from other eukaryotes  <cit> .

the trna complements of the three platyhelminth genomes are compared in detail in figure  <dig>  the amino acids are represented in approximately equal numbers in s. mansoni and schmidtea. nevertheless, there are several notable deviations. s. mansoni contains many more leucine  and histidine  trnas, while serine , cysteine , methionine , and isoleucine  are underrepresented. in addition, there are several substantial differences in codon usage. in most cases, s. mansoni has a more diverse repertoire of trnas: trna-asn-att, trna-arg-cgc, trna-his-atg, trna-ile-gat, trna-pro-ggg, trna-tyr-ata, trna-val-gac are missing in schmidtea. only trna-ser-act is present in schmidtea but absent in schistosoma. the trna complement of s. japonicum, on the other hand, differs strongly from its two relatives. not only is the number of trnas decreased by more than a factor of four, s. japonicum also prefers anticodons that are absent or rare in its relatives, such as trna-ala-ggc, trna-cys-aca, and lys-ctt. on the other hand, no trna-trp was found. since the ugg codon is present in many open reading frames we interpret this as a problem with the incompleteness of the genome assembly rather than a genuine gene loss. the reduction in the number of trnas is also evident by comparing the number of trnas with introns:  <dig> in s. mansoni versus  <dig> in s. japonicum.

it has been shown recently that changes in codon usage, even while coding the same protein sequences, can severely attenuate the virulence of viral pathogens  <cit>  by "de-optimizing" translational efficiency. this observation leads us to speculate that the greater diversity of the trna repertoire could be related to the selection pressures of the parasitic life-style of s. mansoni. the effect is not straightforward, however, because there is no significant correlation of trna copy numbers with the overall codon usage in both s. mansoni and s. japonicum, figure 1c. in contrast, a weak but statistically significant correlation can be observed in schmidtea mediterranea. it would be interesting, therefore, to investigate in detail whether there are differences in codon usage of proteins that are highly expressed in different stages of s. mansoni's life cycle, and whether the relative expression levels of trnas are under stage-specific regulation.

the most striking result of the trnascan-se analysis was the initial finding of  <dig>  glutamine trnas  in s. mansoni in contrast to the  <dig> gln-trnas in s. japonicum and  <dig> in s. mediterranea. nearly all of these  were trna-gln-ttg. in addition, an extreme number of  <dig>  trna-pseudogenes in s. mansoni  was predicted. of these,  <dig>  were also homologous to trna-gln-ttg. these two groups of trna-gln-ttg-derived genes  totaled  <dig> . these high numbers suggest a trna-derived mobile genetic element. we therefore ran the  <dig>  s. mansoni trna-gln-ttg genes through the repeatmasker program  <cit> . almost all of them  were classified as sine elements. further blast analysis revealed that these elements are similar to members of the sm-α family of s. mansoni sine elements  <cit> . removal of these sine-like elements yielded a total of  <dig> predicted glutamine-encoding trnas in s. mansoni. about  <dig> of  <dig> pseudogenes in s. japonicum derived from trna-pro-cgg.

homology-based analysis yielded similar, though somewhat less sensitive, results to those of trnascan-se. for instance, a blast search in s. mansoni with rfam's trna consensus yielded  <dig> predicted trnas compared to the  <dig> predictions made by trnascan-se.

ribosomal rnas
as usual in eukaryotes, the 18s,  <dig> s, and 28s genes are produced by rna polymerase i from a tandemly repeated polycistronic transcript, the ribosomal rna operon. the s. mansoni genome contains about 90- <dig> copies  <cit>  which are nearly identical at sequence level, because they are subject to concerted evolution  <cit> . the repetitive structure of the rrna operons causes substantial problems for genome assembly software  <cit> . in order to obtain a conservative estimate of the copy number, we retained only partial operon sequences that contained at least two of the three adjacent rrna genes. we found  <dig> loci containing parts of 18s,  <dig> s, and 28s genes,  <dig> loci covering 18s and  <dig> s rrna, and  <dig> loci covering  <dig> s and 28s rrnas . adding the copy numbers, we have not fewer than  <dig> copies  and no more than  <dig> copies . the latter is probably an overestimate due to the possibility that the  <dig> s rrna may be contained in two scaffolds. the copy number of rrna operons is thus consistent with the estimate of 90- <dig> from hybridization analysis  <cit> . an analogous analysis of the current s. japonicum assembly yields less accurate results. due to the many short fragments, we obtained  <dig> copies; the true number may lie between  <dig> and  <dig>  however.

the 5s rrna is a polymerase iii transcript that has not been studied in schistosomes so far. we found  <dig> copies of the  <dig> nt long 5s rrna in s. mansoni, compared with  <dig> copies in s. japonicum. four of the  <dig> copies are located within a  <dig>  nt cluster on scaffold <dig> 

spliceosomal rnas and spliced leader rna
spliceosomes, the molecular machines responsible for most splicing reactions in eukaryotic cells, are ribonu-cleoprotein complexes similar to ribosomes  <cit> . the major spliceosome, which cleaves gt-ag introns, includes the five snrnas u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  in the s. mansoni genome, all of them are multicopy genes. by homology search we found  <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>  and  <dig> u <dig> sequences in the genome assembly. interpreting all sequences that are identical in short flanking regions as the same, we would retain only  <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>   <dig> u <dig>  and nine u <dig> genes  <cit> . the true copy number in the s. mansoni genome is most likely somewhere between these upper and lower bounds. for s. japonicum, the corresponding numbers are u1: 2- <dig>  u2: 1- <dig> u <dig>  u4: 1- <dig> u <dig>  u5: 1- <dig>  and u6: 2- <dig>  due to the more fragmented genome assembly we expect the true numbers to be closer to the lower bounds. secondary structures for these candidates are similar to those of typical snrnas, figure  <dig> 

a second, much less frequent, minor spliceosome is responsible for the processing of atypical at-ac introns. it shares only the u <dig> snrna with the major spliceosome. the other four rna components are replaced by variants called u <dig>  u <dig>  u4atac, and u6atac  <cit> . the minor-spliceosomal snrnas are typically much less conserved than the rna components of the major spliceosome  <cit> . it was not surprising, therefore, that these rnas were detectable only by means of gotohscan <cit>  but not with the much less sensitive blast searches. although u4atac and u6atac are quite diverged compared to known homologs, they can be recognized unambiguously based on both secondary structure and conserved sequence motifs. furthermore, the u4atac and u6atac sequences can interact to form the functionally necessary duplex structure shown in figure  <dig>  as in many other species, there is only a single copy of each of the minor spliceosomal snrnas in both of the schistosome genomes, tab.  <dig>  an analysis of promoter sequences showed that the putative snrna promoter motifs in s. mansoni are highly derived. only one of the two u <dig> genes exhibited a clearly visible snrna-like promoter organization.

the spliced leader  rna is one of the very few previously characterized ncrnas from s. mansoni  <cit> . the  <dig> nt sl rna, which was found in a  <dig> nt tandemly repeated fragment , contains the  <dig> nt leader sequence at its 5' end which is transferred in the trans-splicing reaction to the 5' termini of mature mrnas. using blastn, we identified  <dig> sl rna genes. these candidates, along with  <dig> nt flanking sequence, were aligned using clustalx, revealing  <dig> sequences with aberrant flanking regions, which we suspect to be pseudogenic. the remaining sequences are  <dig> identical copies and  <dig> distinct sequence variants. a secondary structure analysis corroborates the model of  <cit> , according to which the s. mansoni sl rna has only two loops, with an unpaired sm binding site . this coincides with the sl rna structure of rotifera  <cit> , but is in contrast to the sl rnas in most other groups of eukaryotes, which exhibit single or triple stem-loop structures  <cit> . a blastn-search against s. mansoni est data confirms that the 5' part of the sl is indeed trans-spliced to mrnas. several nearly identical sl rna homologs are found in s. japonicum.

srp rna and ribonuclease p rna
signal recognition particle  rna, also known as 7sl rna, is part of the signal recognition particle, a ribonucleoprotein that directs packaged proteins to their appropriate locations in the endoplasmic reticulum. although one of the protein subunits of this ribonucleoprotein was cloned in  <dig>  <cit> , little is known about the other subunits or the rna component in s. mansoni. we found eight probable candidates for the srp rna, with one almost canonical sequence , and four possible candidates with point mutations which may influence their function.

the rna component of ribonuclease p  is the catalytically active part of this enzyme that is required for the processing of trna precursors  <cit> . we found one classic rnase p rna in the s. mansoni genome using both gotohscan and rnabob with the eukaryotic  rfam consensus sequence for rnase p as search sequence.

micrornas
micrornas are small rnas that are processed from hairpin-like precursors, see e.g.  <cit> . they are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mrna molecules. so far, no micrornas have been verified experimentally in s. mansoni. the presence of four protein-coding genes encoding crucial components of the microrna processing machinery   <cit> , and the presence of argonaut-like genes in both s. japonicum  <cit>  and s. mansoni , strongly suggests that schistosomes have a functional microrna system. indeed, most recently five mirnas were found by direct cloning in s. japonicum that are also conserved in s. mansoni  <cit> : let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  bantam, mir- <dig>  and a single schistosome-specific microrna. these sequences, including the precursor hairpins, are well conserved in s. japonicum. on the other hand, the microrna precursor sequences of both schistosomes are quite diverged from the consensus of the homologous genes in bilateria.

using bioinformatics  we were able to find only one further mirna candidate in s. mansoni, mir- <dig>  that is also conserved in s. japonicum. in insects, this mirna is clustered with mir- <dig>  the distance of both mirnas is approximately  <dig> kb in drosophilids. we found an uncertain mir- <dig> candidate in s. mansoni, however, on a different scaffold than mir- <dig>  although this sequence nicely folds into a single stem-loop structure, it is conserved only antisense to the annotated mature sequence in insects . this s. mansoni mir- <dig> candidate does not seem to be conserved in s. japonicum.

in  <cit> ,  <dig> micrornas are described for the distantly related trematode schmidtea mediterranea, and additional ones are announced in a recent study focussing on pirnas  <cit> . the overwhelming majority,  <dig>  were reported to be members of  <dig> widely conserved metazoan microrna families, although in some cases even the mature mirna sequence is quite diverged. therefore, we regard several family assignments as tentative at best. of those  <dig> mirnas, we found mir- <dig> only. however, the schistosome sequences are more related to the other bilaterian mir- <dig> homologs than to those of s. mediterranea. out of the remaining  <dig> mirnas that were annotated in s. mediterranea we found that mir- <dig> is also conserved in the two schistosome species. here, the sequences show a common consensus sequence and secondary structure in their precursors .

the small number of recognizable micrornas in schistosomes is in strong contrast to the extensive microrna complement in s. mediterranea, indicating massive loss of micrornas relative to the planarian ancestor. this may be a consequence of the parasitic lifestyle of the schistosomes.

small nucleolar rnas
small nucleolar rnas play essential roles in the processing and modification of rrnas in the nucleolus  <cit> . both major classes, the box h/aca and the box c/d snornas are relatively poorly conserved at the sequence level and hence are difficult to detect in genomic sequences. this has also been observed in a recent ncrna annotation project of the trichoplax adhaerens genome  <cit> . the best-conserved snorna is the atypical u <dig> snorna, which is essential for processing of the 18s rrna transcript into mature 18s rrna  <cit> . in the current assembly of the s. mansoni genome we found six u <dig> loci, but they are also identical in the flanking sequences, suggesting that in fact there is only a single u <dig> gene. no unambiguous homologue was detected for any of the other known snornas.

a de novo search for snornas  resulted in  <dig>  promising candidates , see supplemental data online. all these predictions exhibit highly conserved sequence boxes as well as the typical secondary features of box c/d and box h/aca snornas, respectively.

a comparison of the predicted snornas with the entries in the rfam <cit>  and noncode <cit>  databases returned only  <dig> hits that match to several other rnas like trnas, parts of the rrna operon, snrnas, mrnalike genes and a few of our candidates map to the hammerhead ribozyme. these sequences are likely false positives and have been removed from the candidate list. the number of predicted candidates is much larger than the number of snornas reported in other organisms; for instance  <cit>  lists  <dig> for the human genome. although we most likely do not yet know the full snorna complement of eukaryotic genomes, we have to expect that a large fraction of prediction will turn out to be false positives.

we therefore analysed the conservation of the candidates in s. japonicum and focussed on the snorna candidates with targets in the 18s, 28s and/or  <dig> s ribosomal rna. while targets are predicted for more than half of the candidates, see table  <dig>  the numbers are drastically reduced when conservation of the candidates in s. japonicum is required. note, furthermore, that the fraction of conserved candidates is strongly enriched among those with ribosomal rna targets, indicating that these sets are likely to contain a sizeable fraction of true positives. this filtering step leaves us with  <dig> box c/d and  <dig> box h/aca snorna candidates. while still high, these numbers fall into the expected range for a metazaon snorna complement.

only ribosomal rnas were searched for putative target sites.

we remark, finally, that five of the snorna candidates  are also conserved in schmidtea mediterranea.

other rna motifs
two examples of relatively well-known schistosome non-coding rnas are the hammerhead ribozyme motifs within the sm-α and sj-α sine-like elements  <cit> . a blastn search of the hammerhead ribozyme motif from the rfam database resulted in ~ <dig>  candidates for s. mansoni in contrast to ~ <dig>  candidates for s. japonicum. while high, this number is not surprising considering the generally high copy number of sine elements; previously, the copy number for sm-α elements in the s. mansoni genome was estimated to exceed  <dig>   <cit> . the highly conserved potassium channel rna editing signal  <cit>  is another structured rna element that was described previously  <cit> . we found nine copies of this hairpin structure in the s. mansoni genome assembly and three in s. japonicum.

uncertain and missing candidates
both the mrp rna  <cit>  and the 7sk rna  <cit>  have highly variable, rapidly evolving sequences that make them difficult or impossible to detect in invertebrate genomes. their ancient evolutionary origin and their extremely conserved molecular house-keeping functions make it more than likely that they are present in the schistosome genomes as well. in both cases, we have not been able to identify unambiguous homologs. there are, however, plausible candidates. we briefly describe them in the following paragraphs since they may warrant further attention and may be a useful starting point for subsequent experimental studies, as exemplified by the history of discovery of the snrna in giardia intestinalis  <cit> .

mrp rna has multiple functions, among them mitochondrial rna processing and nucleolar pre-rrna processing. the s. mansoni mrp candidate fits the general secondary structure model of metazoan mrp rnas  <cit>  and analysis with rnaduplex shows that the candidate contains a pseudoknot which exhibited striking sequence identity with known mrps. the locus is well-conserved in s. japonicum. on the other hand, stems  <dig> and  <dig> were divergent compared to known mrps, and stem  <dig> also fails to display clear similarities with known mrps. although quite likely a true mrp homolog, we therefore consider this sequence only tentative.

7sk rna is a general transcriptional regulator, repressing transcript elongation through inhibition of transcription elongation factor ptefb and also suppresses the deaminase activity of apobec3c  <cit> . the s. mansoni 7sk candidate has a 5' stem similar to that described in other invertebrates  <cit> , and parts of the middle of the sequence are also recognizable. there is, furthermore, a homologous locus in the genome of s. japonicum. however, the 3' stem  was not conserved. in addition, a large sequence deletion was evident.

three major classes of ncrnas were expected, but not found, in the s. mansoni genome. as in all other invertebrates genomes, no candidate sequence was found for a telomerase rna. s. mansoni almost certainly has a canonical telomerase holoenzyme, since it encodes telomerase proteins  and has the same telomeric repeat sequences as many other metazoan animals  <cit> . telomerase rnas are notoriously difficult to find, as they are highly divergent among different species, varying in both size and sequence composition  <cit> . vault rnas are known in all major deuterostome lineages  <cit> , and homologs were recently also described in two lophotrochozoan lineages  <cit> . since s. mansoni has a homolog of the major vault protein  we would also expect a corresponding rna component to be present. so far, y rnas have been found only in vertebrates  <cit>  and in nematodes  <cit> , although the ro rnp, that they are associated with, seems to be present in most or even all eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described here a detailed annotation of "housekeeping" ncrnas in the genomes of the parasitic platyhelminth schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma japonicum. limited to the best conserved structured rnas, our work nevertheless uncovered important genomic features such as the existence of a sine family specific to schistosoma mansoni, which is derived from trna-gln-ttg. our data furthermore establish the presence of a minor spliceosome in schistosomes and confirms spliced leader trans-splicing. with a coverage of at least 90-95% of the genomic dna, missing data are not a significant problem. the fragmented genome assemblies, however, preclude accurate counts of the multi-copy genes.

platyhelminths are known to be a fast-evolving phylum  <cit> . it is not surprising therefore that in particular the small ncrnas are hard or impossible to detect by simple homology search tools such as blastn. even specialized tools have been successful in identifying only the better conserved genes such as trna, micrornas, rnase p rna, srp rna. the notoriously poorly conserved families, such as snornas, telomerase rna, or vault rnas, mostly escaped detection.

the description of several novel, and in many cases quite derived, schistosome ncrnas contributes significantly to the understanding of the evolution of the corresponding rna families. the schistosome ncrna sequences, furthermore, are an important input to subsequent homology search projects, since they allow the construction of improved descriptors for sequence/structure-based search algorithms. last but not least, the ncrna annotation tracks are an important contribution to the genome-wide annotation datasets of both s. mansoni and s. japonicum. it not only contributes the protein-based annotation but also helps to identify annotation errors, e.g. cases where putative proteins are annotated that overlap rrna operons or other ncrnas.

the house-keeping ncrnas considered in this study are almost certainly only the proverbial tip of the platyhelminth ncrnas iceberg. the discovery of a large number of mrna-like ncrnas  in many eukaryotes , and in particular in many other invertebrate species  suggests that similar transcripts will also be abundant in schistosomes. the abundant est data for both schistosome species  <cit>  can provide a starting point e.g. for an analysis along the lines of  <cit> . computational surveys, furthermore, have provided evidence for large numbers of rnas with conserved secondary structures in other invertebrates  <cit> . the underlying methods, such as rnaz <cit> , are inherently comparative, presenting difficulties for application to schistosome genomes due to the large evolutionary distance between schistosome and non-schistosome genomes. this is also the case for a recent approach to identify mrna-like non-coding rnas with very low levels of sequence conservation based on their intron structure  <cit> . a deeper understanding of the non-coding transcriptome of schistosomes will therefore have to rely primarily on experimental approaches, either by means of tiling arrays or by means of high throughput transcriptome sequencing.
