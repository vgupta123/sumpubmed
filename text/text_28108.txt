BACKGROUND
taxonomy and systematics are crucial for understanding biological diversity and the conservation of species. nonetheless, a complete understanding of species diversity remains a distant goal for most groups of organisms. a recent review of newly discovered mammal species showed that saturation of species discovery in mammalia has not been reached. the newly added species include not only new described species, but also revisionary new species, which are synonyms or subspecies that have been recognized as valid species  <cit> . the latest version of mammal species of the world  recognized  <dig>  valid species, as well as  <dig>  subspecies and  <dig>  species-level synonyms  <cit> . a large proportion of synonyms and subspecies are assigned those ranks because of the lack of specimens, comprehensive analyses, and critical evaluation. this is especially the case for taxa that are widely distributed and morphologically unremarkable, such as the white-bellied rats of the genus niviventer. these murine rodents are small to medium-sized and are mainly distributed in china, southern himalaya, and southeast asia in various habitats over a wide range of elevations  <cit> . while most species of niviventer have very limited distributions, a few species, such as n. cremoriventer, n. confucianus, and n. fulvescens, are widely spread across large geographic areas and various landscapes .

the taxonomy of niviventer has a long and complicated history. representatives of niviventer were originally included in the genus mus , after which they were placed in epimys , and rattus , successively. the genus was established by musser  <cit> , who included  <dig> species and divided the genus into the n. andersoni-division and n. niviventer-division. according to the taxonomy presented by musser and carleton in  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> taxa had full species status, while another  <dig> were recognized as subspecies or synonyms. the widespread n. cremoriventer, n. confucianus, and n. fulvescens had  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> subspecies and synonyms, respectively. recent studies integrating karyotypic information, dna sequences, and morphological characters recognized n. lotipes   <cit> , n. huang, and n. bukit  as full species  <cit>  but placed n. langbianis into chiromyscus  <cit> . molecular phylogenetic studies further found that the widely distributed species were paraphyletic or even polyphyletic   <cit> . despite the possibility of misidentification, the number of putative species always exceeded that of recognized species  <cit> , implying that species diversity was underestimated. thus, it was reasonable to re-evaluate the large body of remaining subspecies/synonyms within this genus.

the complex distribution pattern, large number of subspecies/synonyms, and morphological similarities make taxonomic and systematic revision for the genus niviventer extremely difficult. many species are morphologically very similar to one another  <cit> . for example, geometric morphometric analyses in a previous study showed that two distinctive genetic lineages largely overlapped . examination of type specimens is always crucial for taxonomic revision and essential for re-evaluating the synonyms. however, the type series for most species distributed in asia are deposited in natural history museums in europe and the united states. thus, comprehensive genetic analyses using topotypes may uncover cryptic species diversity and help to determine key taxa that need to be diagnosed before the type series is examined. in addition to the existing taxonomic problems, the phylogeny of niviventer remained largely obscure. although several major clades and species groups have been recognized, the relationships among them were unresolved, and the phylogenetic positions of n. coninga and n. culturatus were contradictory  <cit> . more than  <dig> niviventer specimens have been sequenced, but most of the previous studies were conducted using only mitochondrial cytochrome b  and cytochrome c oxidase  genes  <cit> . in another previous study using both mitochondrial  and nuclear  loci, the gene trees were conflicting, suggesting that inclusion of multiple nuclear genes is warranted  <cit> .

according to the taxonomy of musser and carleton  <cit>  and recent studies , there are  <dig> recognized niviventer species distributed in china, accounting for 55% of niviventer species, including  <dig> endemic to china  and  <dig> both inside and outside china . nine niviventer species  are distributed in southeast asia outside china. another  <dig> taxa are recognized as synonyms or subspecies of n. andersoni , n. confucianus , n. eha , n. excelsior , n. fulvescens , and n. huang . moreover, according to lu et al.  <cit> , undescribed species may exist in the mountains of southwestern china, an area characterized by extremely complex topography  <cit> .

in the present study, we extensively sampled white-bellied rats throughout china and neighboring northern vietnam, capturing topotypes of  <dig> species, subspecies, and synonyms. we sequenced four unlinked loci, reconstructed phylogenetic relationships, and delimited species boundaries. the goals were i) to clarify the status of species, subspecies, and synonyms, and ii) to uncover underestimated species diversity.

RESULTS
genetic sequences
a total of  <dig> niviventer individuals representing  <dig> species were collected from china and neighboring northern vietnam . we obtained  <dig>  bp of sequences from  <dig> specimens, including  <dig>  bp of mitochondrial dna  and  <dig>  bp of nuclear genes . the other ten individuals each failed to amplify one of the three nuclear genes. the new sequences have been deposited in genbank under the accession numbers ky <dig> to ky <dig> . the appearance of premature stop codons or frame-shift mutations was not observed in coding regions. in addition,  <dig> sequences  representing  <dig> individuals of  <dig> niviventer spp.  were downloaded from genbank . sequences of leopoldamys edwardsi, l. neilli, rattus andamanensis, r. norvegicus, chiromyscus chiropus, c. thomasi, c. langbianis, and mus musculus were chosen as outgroups .fig.  <dig> sample localities of specimens used in the present study. the numbers correspond to the locality numbers in additional file 1: table s1

mitochondrial tree and species recovery
the best-fit partitioning schemes and substitution models were determined by partitionfinder v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  under bayesian information criterion  . the maximum likelihood  tree calculated from cyt b sequences shows the  <dig> niviventer individuals  clustered into four major clades , among which relationships were only weakly supported . clade a was composed of n. fulvescens-like species  and three southeast asian species . clade b was composed of two species from southwestern china and south asia . clade c included n. andersoni and n. excelsior, representing the n. andersoni-division. all individuals in clade d were n. confucianus-like species, including subspecies and synonyms of n. confucianus, species previously included in n. confucianus , and n. tenaster, which was morphologically similar to n. confucianus. in addition, individuals identified as n. bukit, n. eha, n. fulvescens, and n. niviventer in genbank were recovered within two major clades each. the kimura-2-parameter  distances calculated in mega version  <dig>  <cit>  between candidate species were  <dig>  to  <dig>  .table  <dig> sample sizes and species used for each analysis

the species delimitation approach automatic barcode gap discover  can partition sequences into groups or putative species based on gaps between intra- and interspecific diversity of barcoded genes  <cit> . in this study, five abgd analyses with different relative gap width values  were performed on  <dig> cyt b sequences, and two gaps  were observed. nevertheless, all analyses consistently supported a 30-group  scenario only when intraspecific divergence  =  <dig>  . in this scenario,  <dig> chinese sequences were included in  <dig> groups , and  <dig> sequences in the current study were included in  <dig> groups . two candidate species  did not appear as monophyletic groups in our cyt b gene tree. specimens identified as n. andersoni, n. bukit, n. confucianus, n. cremoriventer, n. eha, n. excelsior, n. fulvescens, n. huang, and n. niviventer in genbank were each found in at least two groups.table  <dig> results of automatic barcode gap discovery  analyses with k <dig> distance model

multilocus gene trees
the phylogeny constructed from bayesian and ml analyses of the mitochondrial-nuclear concatenated data  resulted in very similar topologies, and only the mrbayes tree is shown . chiromyscus langbianis and c. chiropus were supported as sister species , forming the sister clade to niviventer . the four mitochondrial clades of niviventer were also recovered. compared to the cyt b gene tree, interspecific relationships were overall highly supported in clades a, b, and c, but remained unresolved in clade d where only posterior probabilities are noted.fig.  <dig> multilocus phylogeny of niviventer conducted using mrbayes. node numbers indicate posterior probabilities with bootstrap support. clades in red indicate topotypes included. the current taxonomy  and putative species recognized by abgd are presented




the phylogeny using  <dig> niviventer sequences plus the outgroup  was constructed according to the mtdna and concatenated data tree with better support for the relationships within the genus. in particular, the relationships among all clades and within clade d were better resolved in this phylogeny .fig.  <dig> multilocus phylogenetic tree of full data set using beast. numbers above the nodes indicate bayesian posterior probabilities 




species trees and species delimitation
the species tree simulated in *beast showed similar topologies with the beast trees , which assigned  <dig> individuals from the full data set  into  <dig> groups according to the abgd results. however, the sister-relationship of groups  <dig> and  <dig> and the interspecific relationships in clade d were not robustly supported . furthermore, group  <dig> was strongly supported as a sister group to the other n. confucianus groups, excluding n. culturatus . a sister relationship between groups  <dig> and  <dig> was strongly supported , although their position was not stable .fig.  <dig> a coalescent-based species tree referred using the *beast model based on the result of abgd analyses. the putative species recognized by bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography  using mitochondrial and nuclear genes and using nuclear genes alone are presented. node numbers indicate posterior probabilities estimated in *beast




the bpp analyses based on the full data set provided similar results when different algorithms, priors, and starting trees were used, and high effective sample sizes   were observed for all parameters. we adopted a conservative criterion, considering pp ≥  <dig>  as strong support for a putative species . when both mitochondrial and nuclear genes were used,  <dig> putative species were recognized ; the nuclear genes alone supported an 11-species scenario . all bpp analyses consistently supported group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  as the same species. group  <dig> was supported as a distinct putative species . animals in this group were from tibet, yunnan, china, and northern vietnam, and were morphologically similar to n. fulvescens, but did not have distinctively bicolored tails  <cit>  .table  <dig> results of bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography  analyses using coalescent species trees as guard trees




when nuclear genes alone were used, bpp supported n. coninga , n. lotipes  and several populations of n. confucianus as one species . all analyses supported group  <dig> from western yunnan and southeastern tibet ; group  <dig> from gongbu, tibet ; and group  <dig> from southern china and northern vietnam  as three putative species .

discussion
correct naming of species
according to the famous chinese teacher confucius, “if names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. if language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success”  <cit> . the species n. confucianus was named after confucius  <cit> , and his quote regarding names is indeed relevant to the taxonomy of the genus niviventer. species diversity within this genus has been underestimated  <cit> , and our understanding of its taxonomy was incomplete  <cit> . these two issues have prevented a full understanding of the systematics and evolution of the genus. multi-locus sequencing for topotype, conducted in this study, indicates the need for several taxonomic and systematic revisions.

implications of the molecular species delimitation analyses
based on the barcoding gap found from the pairwise distances of cyt b sequences, the single gene species delimitation method, abgd, supported the existence of  <dig> groups/putative species in china , in agreement with previous reports by he and jiang  <cit>  and lu et al.  <cit> . although far fewer samples  were available for multilocus species delimitation, bpp analyses still recognized  <dig>  or  <dig>  putative species.

bpp molecular species delimitation approaches have been developed and widely used in mammals  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , and reptiles  <cit> . it should be noted that the biological species concept associated with bpp may not be true in practice  <cit> , and that simulations showed that bpp is robust in the case of incomplete lineage sorting but sensitive to hybridization. strongly supported putative species could be either valid species or long-term isolated conspecific populations. on the other hand, when named species were not strongly supported  as putative species by bpp, the results either suggested genetic homogenization  or gene flow between valid species. in both cases, the taxonomic status must still be evaluated carefully in a taxonomic context and must not violate the international code of zoological nomenclature  <cit> . the bpp analysis that used nuclear genes alone did not strongly support n. huang, n. lotipes, or n. coninga as putative species. on the other hand, four putative new species  need further attention. comprehensive morphological and morphometric examinations are warranted to test species status for all these taxa.

value of topotypical samples
species in the genus niviventer are morphologically very similar. the current taxonomy roughly relies on the size of skull, the length of ear and tail, and the color of skin and feet  <cit> . morphological identification is not only time-consuming but also challenging. all but one of the topotypes of niviventer sequenced in the current study were presented for the first time. we carefully assigned each individual to recognized species on the basis of morphology  and the molecular results. these voucher specimens and sequences are valuable for barcoding-based species identification and taxonomic revision. as shown in our cyt b gene tree, genbank sequences under the same species names were found in different groups or major clades , indicating misidentification.

implications for taxonomy
the analyses of topotype sequences of named synonyms and subspecies revealed multiple putative species within the currently recognized species of n. confucianus, n. fulvescens, n. andersoni, and n. eha. within n. confucianus, the subspecies n. confucianus mentosus should be examined more closely, as it was supported as a distinct group/putative species in all analyses. this subspecies was named and described as a species by thomas  <cit>  on the basis of the holotype from hkampti, myanmar, after which it was assigned as a subspecies of n. niviventer  <cit>  or a synonym of n. confucianus  <cit> . animals from chayu , and nujiang  were assigned to n. c. mentosus on the basis of their longer hind feet  and white-tipped tail  <cit> . niviventer sp.  <dig> collected from guangxi and yunnan were marked by a white tail tip and conspicuous brush, a typical pattern of n. confucianus that distinguishes it from n. c. yaoshanensis, n. niviventer, or n. fulvescens. niviventer sp.  <dig> is similar to n. fulvescens in body size and color pattern but could be distinguished from n. fulvescens and n. cremoriventer by its fuzzy bicolor tail.

our analyses also suggest that diversity in some groups may be overestimated. niviventer lotipes , recognized by li et al.  <cit>  for its distinct karyotype, was not supported as a putative species by any of our bpp analyses. it was originally described as a subspecies of n. confucianus  <cit>  on the basis of the holotype from nada, hainan, then treated as a subspecies of n. niviventer  <cit>  or a synonym of n. tenaster  <cit> . we did not included any topotype of n. lotipes , but all specimens we included from hainan, fujian and guangxi could be affiliated with the holotype  of n. lotipes based on the sharp bicolor appearance of the tail, and are different from specimens used in li et al.  <cit> , showing a sharp bicolor appearance. however, individuals from other localities had a white-tipped tail. another recognized species, n. coninga , was not supported by the bpp analyses using nuclear genes. furthermore, most recognized subspecies of n. confucianus were clustered into two lineages or groups . they were not supported as putative species by bpp analyses. therefore, the taxonomic status of all these clades must be re-examined.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we collected extensive samples of niviventer in china, including most topotypes of species, subspecies, and synonyms. we developed a robust phylogeny on the basis of one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. four major clades were recovered by both concatenation and coalescent-based approaches. the sister relationship between n. brahma and n. eha was well supported, and relationships among n. confucianus-like species were mostly well resolved. our coalescent-based species delimitation analyses indicated that species diversity of niviventer may be overestimated by single locus in previous studies, and three species should be re-evaluated using morphological or morphometric approaches. however, our analyses also indicated that cryptic or putative new species may exist in the mountains of southwest china, an area characterized by extremely complex topography, climate conditions, and geographic history.
