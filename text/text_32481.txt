BACKGROUND
recent postgenomic transcriptome analyses, including cdna sequencing and tiling array analyses, have revealed that large numbers of transcripts unlikely to encode polypeptides are produced from regions covering a large fraction of the human and mouse genomes  <cit> . a recent report from the encode project  <cit>  estimated that 93% of the human genome is transcribed into rna, whereas only 2% of the human genome codes for protein  <cit> . therefore, most of the rnas transcribed from the human genome must be non-protein coding transcripts, commonly called noncoding rnas .

the limited number of long ncrnas that have been characterized to date exhibit diverse functions, as well as cell type-specific expression and localization to subcellular compartments. further determination of the functions of long ncrnas will expand our understanding of various fundamental biological processes. many recent efforts in transcript mapping and expression profiling have provided a rough overview of putative ncrna functions. a major subset of ncrnas associates with specific chromosomal loci, where they may play a role in altering chromosomal structure and regulating gene expression. the xist, air, and kcnq1ot <dig> ncrnas are involved in genomic imprinting accompanied by structural changes to the chromosome  <cit> . hotair has been shown to recruit the prc <dig> histone modification complex, regulate specific hox gene loci on different chromosomes  <cit> , and reprogram chromosomal structure in a manner that leads to cancer metastasis  <cit> . furthermore, the prc <dig> complex was found to associate with hundreds of large intergenic non-coding rnas  that were identified by a genome-wide search based on the histone h3k <dig> code  <cit> . these data indicate a general long ncrna function in epigenetic control of gene expression. additionally, recent reports have indicated that a subset of ncrnas play essential roles in intracellular substructure organization. the menε/β ncrnas are essential for nuclear paraspeckle formation through their interaction with specific rna-binding proteins  <cit> .

in contrast to their nuclear functions, little is known about the cytoplasmic functions of long ncrnas in mammalian cells. the nron ncrna was reported to associate with importin β in the cytoplasm and may regulate the nuclear transport of the nfat transcription factor upon calcium signaling  <cit> . the uhg and gas <dig> ncrnas, which produce small nucleolar rnas  from their introns, are transported into the cytoplasm where they are rapidly degraded by nonsense-mediated decay   <cit> . therefore, the spliced exons of uhg and gas <dig> may be nonfunctional transcripts. however, the gas <dig> ncrna is involved in the proliferation of a leukemia cell line, and a fragment of the gas <dig> ncrna acts as a riboregulator of a nuclear receptor  <cit> . in plants, the ncrna ips <dig> acts as a molecular decoy for a specific mirna and attenuates the effect of that mirna on its target mrna  <cit> .

cytoplasmic mrna levels are controlled via various mrna degradation pathways that recognize the structural features of mrnas targeted for degradation. aberrant mrnas with a premature termination codon  are specifically recognized by rna surveillance machinery and committed to the nmd pathway  <cit> . the nmd pathway also degrades uhg and gas <dig> ncrnas transported into the cytoplasm  <cit> . in mammalian cells, hupf <dig> triggers nmd of ptc-containing mrnas or ncrnas and interacts with hupf <dig>  which associates with the exon junction complex  on spliced mature mrnas  <cit> . staufen <dig>  which binds to a specific stem-loop structure in the 3'utr, also recruits hupf <dig>  and the interaction elicits the degradation of the target mrnas  <cit> . hupf <dig> was recently shown to interact with risc and be involved in the destabilization of mirna-targeted mrnas  <cit> .

here, we identified long ncrnas that are expressed specifically in the thymus. the thymus is an organ located in the upper anterior portion of the chest and is the site of t-lymphocyte maturation. therefore, thymus-specific ncrnas are intriguing candidates for factors involved in the regulation of thymus-specific physiological events such as t-lymphocyte maturation. one thymus-specific ncrna, thy-ncr <dig>  was expressed only in a few t-cell lines, all of which originated from immature stage iii t cells. thy-ncr <dig> exhibits complex alternative splicing to produce several isoforms. we further identified a putative target mrna that is controlled by thy-ncr <dig> via a novel hupf1-dependent rna degradation pathway.

RESULTS
the thymus-specific ncrna, thy-ncr <dig>  is expressed in a subset of leukemia t-cell lines
to identify long ncrnas that are involved in thymus-specific physiological events, we examined a microarray dataset obtained using our original microarray to monitor the expression of human non-protein coding transcripts selected from the h-invitational database http://www.h-invitational.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp <cit> . ncrna-like transcripts that were predominantly expressed in the thymus were selected based on a simple comparison of the microarray signals from human thymus, brain, liver, and testis.

the thymus-specificity of each transcript was validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  using total rna samples prepared from  <dig> human organs, including the  <dig> listed above . we selected  <dig> thymus-specific ncrnas that included three ncrnas identified in our primary screening of tissue-specific ncrnas  <cit> . for further characterization of the expression pattern of each ncrna during t-cell maturation in the thymus,  <dig> t-cell leukemia cell lines were examined. these leukemia cell lines were originally derived from t cells at various stages of maturation, and each cell line therefore partially reflects the features of native t-cell maturation. the cell lines were used for expression profiling of the  <dig> thymus-specific ncrnas, and qrt-pcr analyses revealed that the majority of the thymus-specific ncrnas were expressed in all  <dig> t-cell leukemia cell lines . however, the expression of hit <dig> was restricted to the t-cell lines dnd <dig>  hpb-all, jurkat, and molt- <dig>  which are all derived from immature stage iii t cells  <cit>  . this specific expression pattern suggests that the hit <dig> ncrna functions in some physiological process specific to immature stage iii t cells. we further characterized this transcript, which we have named thymus-specific ncrna- <dig> .

the thy-ncr <dig> gene is coordinately expressed with the cd <dig> gene cluster in a cell lineage-specific manner
the thy-ncr <dig> gene is located at 1q <dig>  on human chromosome  <dig>  this locus overlaps with a number of olfactory receptor  genes. indeed, an or10r <dig> gene and a related or pseudogene are encoded in the antisense strand of the thy-ncr <dig> gene. since or gene expression is normally restricted to the olfactory bulb, the thymus-specific thy-ncr <dig> is unlikely to control or genes. however, the possibility that this subset of or genes is expressed during t-cell maturation and that thy-ncr <dig> acts as a regulatory antisense rna could not be excluded. therefore, the possible regulatory role of thy-ncr <dig> in or10r <dig> gene expression was first examined in the thymus and in the jurkat t-cell leukemia cell line. an rnase a/t <dig> protection assay using an rna probe covering the or10r <dig> gene in exon  <dig> of thy-ncr <dig> revealed that or10r <dig> gene expression was undetectable both in thymus tissue and jurkat cells, whereas thy-ncr <dig> was highly expressed . this result strongly suggests that thy-ncr <dig> has a t-cell-specific function independent of or gene expression.

the t-cell-related cd <dig> gene cluster is located at an adjacent chromosomal locus,  <dig> kb from the thy-ncr <dig> gene . cd <dig> is a classical cell surface marker antigen, which displays lipid antigens on the surface of dendritic cells; however, its exact function in t cells remains elusive  <cit> . expression profiling of cd <dig> gene family members  in the  <dig> t-cell leukemia cell lines revealed that their expression correlated with that of thy-ncr <dig> . expression of cd1a, 1b, 1c, and 1e, which are class i cd <dig> proteins and more proximal to thy-ncr <dig>  almost completely overlapped with thy-ncr <dig> expression with respect to both the cell lines in which cd1a, 1b, 1c, and 1e were expressed and their relative expression levels in those cell lines . cd <dig> d, the only class ii cd <dig> protein in the cluster, was expressed with a similar pattern but more variably than the class  <dig> cd <dig> genes .

in rodents, class i cd <dig> genes have been lost from the genome, resulting in only the class ii cd <dig> d gene remaining at the syntenic locus  <cit>  . the search for a putative thy-ncr <dig> ortholog near the cd <dig> d gene and at other loci in the mouse genome by sequence comparison was unsuccessful, suggesting that thy-ncr <dig> was lost from the mouse genome with the class i cd <dig> genes . thus, thy-ncr <dig> may play a role in cooperation with class i cd <dig> proteins in immature t cells or, alternatively, control class i cd <dig> gene expression in humans.

cd <dig> genes are expressed in dendritic cells  as well as in t cells. therefore, the coordinated expression of thy-ncr <dig> and cd <dig> genes was then investigated in the dc lineage. the expression of thy-ncr <dig> as well as cd1a and cd1b was monitored during differentiation of dcs from cd14+ monocytic cells  <cit> . in contrast to t cells, thy-ncr <dig> was not expressed during dc differentiation, although the cd <dig> genes were expressed . this result clearly demonstrated that the coordinated expression of thy-ncr <dig> with the class  <dig> cd <dig> genes is t-cell lineage-specific.

complex alternative splicing produces multiple thy-ncr <dig> isoforms
according to the h-invitational database, the thy-ncr <dig> transcript  is estimated to be  <dig>  kb in size and composed of three exons. in our previous study, northern hybridization to detect hit <dig> detected the accumulation of a ~ <dig> -kb transcript in the thymus  <cit> . these data indicate that the thy-ncr <dig> gene produces several ncrna isoforms, presumably by alternative splicing. cdna cloning based on est data revealed the existence of at least  <dig> different splicing isoforms, ex1-2- <dig> , ex1- <dig>  ex1-4- <dig>  and ex1- <dig>  in the thymus . rnase protection assays using probes covering the exon-exon junction of each splicing isoform revealed that ex1- <dig> was the most abundant isoform in both thymus tissue  and t-cell leukemia jurkat cells . ex1- <dig> is estimated to be  <dig>  kb, corresponding to the transcript previously detected by northern hybridization analysis  <cit> . northern hybridization analysis with a probe corresponding to ex1- <dig> detected a ~ <dig> -kb transcript in the thymus and in the hpb-all and jurkat t-cell leukemia cell lines, whereas the ex <dig> probe detected a  <dig> -kb transcript that corresponds to ex1-2- <dig> with a similar expression specificity . the broad band corresponding to ex1- <dig>  could be sharpened by rnase h treatment in the presence of oligo dt, indicating that a heterogeneous population of the ex1- <dig> transcript possessing poly tails exists . two thy-ncr <dig> 3' termini were identified by 3' race downstream of the canonical poly  signals mapped at the ends of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> .

an rnase protection assay using the ex <dig> probe  detected several bands in addition to one corresponding to the full-length exon  <dig> , suggesting that additional alternative splicing sites are present within exon  <dig>  further cdna cloning and rnase protection assay of the exon  <dig> region revealed that two additional splice sites existed in exon  <dig>  which resulted in the production of three exon  <dig> isoforms: exon 1b, exon 1c, and the unspliced exon  . the additional exon 1-derived forms are shown in figure 3d . another rnase protection assay probe lacking  <dig> nt of the exon  <dig> 5' terminus did not detect these bands , suggesting that these transcripts correspond to isoforms whose 5' end is shifted downstream. taken together, the total number of thy-ncr <dig> splicing isoforms is estimated to be at least  <dig> .

next, we investigated the levels of the three exon  <dig> isoforms linked to downstream exon  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> by rt-pcr using primer pairs for the exon  <dig> common primer and various exon 2- <dig> specific primers . exon 1a was most frequently combined with exon  <dig> , whereas exons  <dig> and  <dig> were more frequently combined with exon 1b . the level of the exon 1c- <dig> isoform was remarkably increased in skw <dig> cells compared to the other three t-cell lines . in contrast, exon 1c was rarely combined with exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> in hpb-all cells . these results indicate that the exon combinations are cell-type specific.

thy-ncr <dig> transcripts are cytoplasmic but not susceptible to nmd
the intracellular localization of each thy-ncr <dig> isoform was examined in hpb-all cells. the cells were homogenized and separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, followed by quantitation of thy-ncr <dig> levels in each fraction by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure 4a, the major splicing isoforms  were localized to the cytoplasm, similar to typical mrnas . in contrast, a large fraction of the precursor thy-ncr <dig>  which retains intron  <dig> , was localized to the nucleus, similar to β-actin precursor mrna . these results confirmed that the hpb-all cells were successfully fractionated and that the mature thy-ncr <dig> transcript was localized to the cytoplasm. the same localization analysis was conducted in jurkat cells, and the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of thy-ncr <dig> isoforms was the same as that observed in hpb-all cells .

the data indicating that thy-ncr <dig> is cytoplasmic raised the possibility that thy-ncr <dig> encodes a functional short polypeptide. sucrose density gradient analysis revealed that thy-ncr <dig> isoforms were commonly enriched in polysome-like fractions that were sensitive to edta treatment . the thy-ncr <dig> isoforms were examined for orfs, and the conservation of each orf was determined in four primate species where putative thy-ncr <dig> counterparts are predicted. in exon  <dig>  which is included in all the isoforms, the orf located most proximal to the 5' terminus consists of only  <dig> codons, and the largest orf consists of  <dig> codons . the sequence alignment of the first  and the second  orfs between the counterparts in four primates, humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, and rhesus monkeys revealed that two of the nine amino acids encoded in the first orf were not conserved in two primate species, and a termination codon appeared at the fifth codon of the second orf in rhesus monkeys . these data strongly suggest that these orfs are unlikely to encode any functional polypeptides.

evidence indicating that some cytoplasmic ncrnas are degraded via the nmd pathway  <cit>  raises the possibility that thy-ncr <dig> is an nmd target. the termination codon of the orf in the first exon would be recognized as a premature termination codon  if translated. however, rnai depletion of hupf <dig> in jurkat cells  to arrest nmd led to no obvious stabilization of any thy-ncr <dig> rna isoforms. in contrast, the levels of gas <dig> and uhg, both known nmd targets, were significantly elevated upon hupf <dig> depletion . this result indicated that thy-ncr <dig> is not susceptible to nmd.

thy-ncr <dig> is a negative riboregulator of mfap <dig> gene expression
to examine the biological function of thy-ncr <dig>  each isoform was selectively degraded using rnai in hpb-all cells. the sirna  <dig>  which corresponds to a sequence in exon  <dig>  depleted all isoforms, while sirna 3- <dig> and 3- <dig> depleted two major isoforms , and sirna  <dig> specifically depleted the ex1-4- <dig> isoform . microarray analysis and subsequent qrt-pcr verification were used to identify genes whose expression was controlled by thy-ncr <dig> isoforms. microfibril-associated glycoprotein  <dig>  mrna was elevated ~ <dig> -fold upon depletion of thy-ncr <dig> isoforms with sirnas  <dig>  3- <dig>  and 3- <dig>  but not sirna  <dig> . northern hybridization revealed that mfap <dig> mrna accumulated as a single isoform of ~ <dig> kb, and its level increased without any changes in mrna length upon thy-ncr <dig> knockdown .

possible involvement of thy-ncr <dig> in a novel hupf1-dependent pathway for mfap <dig> mrna degradation
the mfap <dig> mrna level increased ~2-fold in response to hupf <dig> knockdown, which was an increase similar to that of the known nmd targets, gas <dig> and uhg, in jurkat cells . mfap <dig> mrna appears to be a normal mrna since no ptcs are predicted according to the sequence information of the cdna clones in the public databases. this observation suggests that mfap <dig> mrna was unlikely to be subjected to nmd. intriguingly, hupf <dig> rnai did not change the mfap <dig> mrna level, whereas gas <dig> and uhg levels were significantly elevated . these results were confirmed with different sirnas against hupf <dig> or hupf <dig> . these data indicate that mfap <dig> mrna is degraded by a hupf1-dependent pathway distinct from nmd.

the rna-binding protein staufen  <dig> binds to a specific stem-loop structure in the 3'utrs of hupf1-target mrnas and recruits hupf <dig> to those mrnas  <cit> . our search for such a stem-loop structure failed to identify any typical structure in the 3'utr of mfap <dig> mrna. furthermore, staufen  <dig> rnai led to no obvious alteration in the mfap <dig> mrna level in jurkat cells , suggesting that hupf <dig> was recruited to mfap <dig> mrna via an unidentified factor. coimmunoprecipitation using a hupf <dig> antibody revealed that mfap <dig> mrna, as well as other known nmd and smd targets, was efficiently precipitated with the hupf <dig> antibody, confirming the association of hupf <dig> with mfap <dig> mrna .

next, the relationship between hupf1-dependent mfap <dig> mrna degradation and thy-ncr <dig> was examined. as shown in figure 6d, thy-ncr <dig> was depleted in the presence and absence of hupf <dig> to examine whether these two factors are involved in different pathways for destabilizing mfap <dig> mrna. the level of mfap <dig> mrna increased 2-fold upon thy-ncr <dig> depletion . however, no obvious further elevation in the mfap <dig> mrna level was observed in the absence of hupf <dig> , suggesting that thy-ncr <dig> acts to suppress mfap <dig> gene expression via the same pathway as that of hupf1-dependent degradation.

discussion
thy-ncr <dig> is transcribed from chromosome 1q <dig>  within the or gene cluster. however, thy-ncr <dig> was expressed only in the thymus, where the or genes were not expressed. the expression of the cd <dig> gene cluster, located  <dig> kb from thy-ncr <dig>  was highly correlated with thy-ncr <dig> expression in the t-cell lineage, but not in the dc-cell lineage. thus, the thy-ncr <dig> gene was specifically expressed at one stage of t-cell maturation. expression of thy-ncr <dig> may be mechanistically linked to the activation of the cd <dig> gene cluster expression but not to the expression of the surrounding or gene cluster.

our attempts to disrupt thy-ncr <dig> function by rnai were limited, since rnai may inefficiently degrade the nuclear-localized fraction of thy-ncr <dig>  the nuclear function of thy-ncr <dig> must be examined in future studies to determine whether a mechanistic link exists between the expression of thy-ncr <dig> and the cd <dig> gene cluster. in yeast and fly, ncrna transcription affects the expression of adjacent genes through transcriptional interference  <cit> . recently, ncrna transcription was reported to lead to stepwise chromatin remodeling in the promoter region and activation of the fbp <dig> gene in schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> . these data suggest that thy-ncr <dig> may affect cd <dig> gene expression in cis by a chromosome-associated mechanism that would be difficult to interrupt with thy-ncr <dig> rnai. since no mouse counterpart has been identified, chromosomal manipulation of the thy-ncr <dig> gene in human t-cell lines will be required to explore the nuclear functions of this transcript.

the thy-ncr <dig> transcript is likely to be transcribed by rna polymerase ii, as its biogenesis pathway is similar to that of an mrna, including export to the cytoplasm. alternative splicing events and putative alternative transcription start sites are able to create at least  <dig> different thy-ncr <dig> isoforms. the intracellular distribution of the thy-ncr <dig> isoforms was mostly cytoplasmic, where they were enriched in the small polysome-like fractions. the distribution of the putative target mrna mfap <dig> did not overlap with any of the thy-ncr <dig> isoforms in the sucrose gradient fractionation , suggesting that the effect of thy-ncr <dig> on mfap <dig> mrna stability is indirect and, presumably, mediated by specific regulatory factor. northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that mfap <dig> transcript size was unchanged by thy-ncr <dig> depletion. the unspliced mfap <dig> pre-mrna level remained constant after thy-ncr <dig> depletion . these data strongly suggest that thy-ncr <dig> depletion results in the destabilization of the mature mfap <dig> mrna rather than affecting transcription or splicing regulation. a sequence comparison of thy-ncr <dig> with mfap <dig> mrna revealed that a short pyrimidine stretch  located downstream of the mfap <dig> mrna initiation codon is similar to a sequence in exon  <dig> of thy-ncr <dig> . this similarity suggests the intriguing possibility that thy-ncr <dig> acts to capture an mfap <dig> mrna stabilizing factor recognizing the pyrimidine-rich stretch. this model would explain how ex1- <dig> and ex1-2- <dig>  but not ex1-4- <dig>  can influence mfap <dig> mrna levels. the various splicing isoforms may play distinct regulatory roles in the cytoplasm, one of which is to regulate mfap <dig> mrna stability.

mfap <dig> mrna was destabilized via a hupf1-dependent pathway in jurkat cells. rnai depletion of hupf <dig> stabilized mfap <dig> mrna, and a hupf <dig> antibody co-immunoprecipitated mfap <dig> mrna. translation arrest with cycloheximide also stabilized mfap <dig> mrna, indicating that hupf <dig> is involved in a translation-dependent mrna degradation pathway . the evidence that mfap <dig> mrna possesses no putative ptcs and that neither hupf <dig> nor staufen  <dig> is involved in mfap <dig> mrna destabilization indicates that a novel hupf1-dependent mrna decay pathway regulates the mfap <dig> mrna level in jurkat cells. identification of a new hupf <dig> adaptor may be the next step in defining the molecular mechanism of this mrna degradation pathway.

our results here demonstrated that thy-ncr <dig> acts to reduce the level of mfap <dig> mrna. a double-knockdown experiment suggested that the thy-ncr1-dependent pathway overlaps with the hupf1-dependent pathway for mfap <dig> mrna degradation. we confirmed that hupf <dig> association with mfap <dig> mrna is not altered in the presence or absence of thy-ncr <dig> and that thy-ncr <dig> isoforms were poorly co-immunoprecipitated with anti-hupf <dig> antibody, suggesting that thy-ncr <dig> is not directly involved in hupf <dig> binding to mfap <dig> mrna . thy-ncr <dig> may indirectly control a cytoplasmic regulatory factor that modulates the activity of hupf <dig> or other factors involved in this decay pathway.

mfap <dig> encodes a polypeptide that contains a fibronectin-like domain for cell adhesion. a recent report revealed that mfap <dig> facilitates the ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that mfap <dig> acts as an angiopoietin-like growth factor  <cit> . the specific physiological role of mfap <dig> in immature t cells remains to be clarified. elucidation of the physiological role of mfap <dig> may also reveal the significance of the regulation of mfap <dig> gene expression by the thymus-specific riboregulator, thy-ncr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results show that thy-ncr <dig> ncrna is a functional cytoplasmic "riboregulator" at one specific stage of t-cell maturation. thy-ncr <dig> controls the abundance of mfap <dig> mrna, which is degraded via an uncharacterized hupf1-dependent degradation pathway.
