BACKGROUND
leptospirosis, caused by infection with pathogenic leptospira species belonging to different serogroups and serovars, is one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases in the world  <cit> . a wide variety of serogroups and serovars have been identified along with endemicity which varies from region to region  <cit> . the leptospiral vaccines used currently are mainly multivalent dead whole-cell mixtures made of several local dominant serovars in different countries and regions. these vaccines, however, do not confer cross-protective immunity to the serogroups that are not represented in the vaccine  <cit> , allowing the unrepresented serovars to continue causing outbreaks of leptospirosis. for instance, in a central province, anhui, and an eastern province, zhejiang, of china, l. interrogans serogroup sejroe serovar medanensis caused local outbreaks of leptospirosis  <cit> . in addition, vaccination with the whole-cell vaccines may lead to incomplete, short-term immunity as well as serious side effects  <cit> . a universal vaccine against leptospirosis is not available yet, making the identification of genus-specific protein antigens  that display extensive cross-immunity very valuable for developing new vaccines and serodiagnostic methods.

outer membrane proteins  are important pathogenic components and highly conserved in different serogroups and serovars of pathogenic leptospires. ompl <dig>  a transmembrane omp with  <dig> amino acid residues, first reported by haake and his colleagues in  <dig>  is a porin expressed by all the tested pathogenic leptospira species  <cit> . however, the diversity of ompl <dig> gene sequences from different pathogenic leptospira spp. and the distribution of the ompl <dig> gene in clinical isolates had not been characterized until now. moreover, the cross-immunogenicity and immunoprotective effects of ompl <dig> were mostly unknown.

in this study, we sequenced and analyzed ompl <dig> genes cloned from standard pathogenic strains of leptospires prevalent in china. several prokaryotic recombinant products of the gene  were expressed and their rabbit antisera were prepared. rompl1-based elisas were established to examine specific antibodies in sera from leptospirosis patients. in parallel, the microscopic agglutination test  was performed to detect the cross-immunoagglutination of different antisera against rompl <dig> proteins, and immunoelectron microscopy  was employed to localize ompl <dig> on the leptospires. finally, immunoprotection of rompl <dig> was tested in guinea pigs. taken together, our results suggest that ompl <dig> could be used as a major component of a universal and efficient immunogen for vaccination and also for diagnosis of leptospirosis.

RESULTS
amplification of ompl <dig> genes in the standard and clinical strains
all the  <dig> standard strains and  <dig> isolates of pathogenic leptospira species  carried the ompl <dig> gene, since amplicons with the expected size were produced by pcr from all the strains and isolates .

molecular phylogeny and gene-typing of ompl <dig> gene
based on the molecular phylogenetic relationship of their nucleotide sequences  and putative amino acid sequences , ompl <dig> genes from the pathogenic leptospires could be classified into three groups: ompl1/ <dig>  ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig> . sequence identity of the putative amino acid sequences between ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig>  ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig>  and ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig> gene types was  <dig> %– <dig> %,  <dig> %– <dig> %, and  <dig> %– <dig> %, respectively. in addition, the ompl <dig> gene sequencing data of  <dig> clinical strains also supported the classification into three groups . both the nucleotide and putative amino acid sequence identities among the clinical strains with the same ompl <dig> gene type were above 98% .

data of secondary structure analysis of ompl <dig> proteins
all the three gene types of ompl <dig> proteins had very similar predicted secondary structures and antigenic indexes . the ompl <dig> proteins had five main putative surface-membrane regions  and seven transmembrane regions . the only salient different was the presence of less alpha-helix in the n-terminal and beta-sheet in the c-terminal region of the ompl1/ <dig> sequence, compared to the sequences of ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig> 

identification of expressed rompl <dig> proteins and titers of rabbit antisera
rompl1/ <dig>  rompl1/ <dig> and rompl1/ <dig> were well expressed after induction with iptg and showed single bands in gel after purification by ni-nta-chromatography . western blot analysis also indicated that serum samples from leptospirosis patients could recognize rompl <dig> proteins , implying that the proteins are immunogenic during natural infection. immunodiffusion titers of all the rabbit antisera against rompl <dig> proteins were at least 1: <dig> 

localization of ompl <dig> proteins on leptospires
using anti-rompl1/ <dig>  anti-rompl1/ <dig> and anti-rompl1/ <dig> sera as the primary antibodies, all the colloidal gold particles conjugated to secondary antibodies were bound on the surface of l. interrogans serovar autumnalis strain lin  <dig> , serovar lai strain lai , and l. borgpetersenii serovar ballum strain pishu  .

titers of mat
the antisera against rompl1/ <dig>  rompl1/ <dig> and rompl1/ <dig> were able to cross-agglutinate with mat titers of 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> for all the  <dig> standard strains and  <dig> clinical strains of pathogenic leptospires .

detection of antibodies against rompl <dig> proteins in leptospirosis patients
in elisa assays using rompl1/ <dig>  rompl1/ <dig> and rompl1/ <dig>  the positive rates for igg in specimens from  <dig> leptospirosis patients using 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> serum dilutions were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively . when using 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> serum dilutions from the same specimens, the positive rates for igm were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively .

inhibition of adherence by antisera against rompl <dig> proteins
anti-rompl1/ <dig> , anti-rompl1/ <dig>  or anti-rompl1/ <dig>  sera could completely inhibit the adherence of l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai to macrophages , demonstrating cross-inhibition effects among the different anti-sera.

immunoprotection due to immunization with rompl <dig> proteins
immunization of guinea pigs with rompl1/ <dig>  rompl1/ <dig> and rompl1/ <dig> conferred a significant level of resistance against lethal challenge with pathogenic leptospires from the three different ompl <dig> groups . however, the immunoprotective rates against the same ompl <dig> gene type leptospiral infection as the immunizing recombinant protein  were higher than when strains and proteins from different ompl <dig> gene types were used .

discussion
outer membrane proteins exposed on the surface of leptospires are known to react with the host cell and environment. interestingly, lipopolysaccharide fractions confer protective immunity against challenge with homologous but not heterogonous leptospires, whereas protein extract induced significant protection against both types of challenge  <cit> . thus far, a number of outer membrane proteins of leptospires, such as ompl <dig>  lipl <dig>  lipl <dig>  lipl <dig>  liga and ligb, have been cloned and characterized, and some of them have been shown to stimulate specific immunity in animal models  <cit> . among all the leptospiral omps, ompl <dig> is a unique transmembrane protein that was confirmed to function as a porin, contribute to the survival of leptospires, and display synergetic immunoprotection with lipl <dig>  <cit> . however, major questions such as the distribution of ompl <dig> gene types in leptospiral strains, the exact localization of ompl <dig>  and cross-immunogenicity and immunoprotective effects of ompl <dig> proteins remain unaddressed.

this study reveals that the ompl <dig> gene is present in the genomes of all the pathogenic leptospires tested. according to our alignment and phylogenetic analysis from the  <dig> standard strains of pathogenic leptospira spp., three groups of ompl <dig>  exist. however, the predicted secondary structure of the ompl <dig> proteins revealed that there is little difference among the three groups. thus, the differences in nucleotide sequences in the ompl <dig> gene types may not affect the immunogenicity and ompl <dig> proteins, identifying ompl <dig> as a genus-specific protein antigen.

surface exposure is a key characteristic for an effective antigen. although ompl <dig> may be an outer membrane protein according to previous reports, the precise localization of ompl <dig> still remained unclear. leptospires possess both inner and outer membranes, but only the proteins expressed in the outer membrane are capable of interacting with the host immune system. to begin to characterize the localization, we used the prokaryotic recombinant expression technique to obtain a large amount of homogeneous ompl <dig> proteins for preparation of immunoresponsive antisera from rabbits. visualization by immuno-electron microscopy using anti-ompl <dig> anti-sera confirmed that ompl <dig> is located at the surface of the outer membrane of leptospires. mat is a standard method for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis and serological classification of leptospires, for which live leptospiral cells are typically used  <cit> . in this study, we used mat to examine cross-immunoagglutination among the antisera from rompl <dig> proteins and a large number of strains belonging to different pathogenic leptospiral serogroups/serovars. the results indicated that there is extensive cross-immunoagglutination between the different ompl <dig> gene types of pathogenic leptospiral strains and the ompl <dig> antisera, and not surprisingly, the highest agglutination was observed between antisera from the same ompl <dig> gene types as the leptospiral strains. furthermore, elisa results revealed that ompl1s-specific antibodies are produced in all the sera from leptospirosis patients, and the trends in cross-immunoreactivities in the different elisa tests are also similar to those of mat.

at least  <dig> serovars of pathogenic leptospires belonging to  <dig> serogroups have been found to date in china, but only a few of them frequently cause leptospirosis. according to the annual reports on leptospirosis from chinese cdcs, l. interrogans serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae serovar lai is the most dominant pathogenic leptospires, responsible for approximately 75% of the morbidity in the country. the other pathogenic leptospires causing leptospirosis are the grippotyphosa, autumnalis, australis, pomona and hebdomadis serovars  <cit> . our study showed that all the  <dig> clinical strains of different pathogenic leptospiral serogroup/serovars belong to either the ompl1/ <dig> or ompl1/ <dig> group . thus, we conclude that leptospires from the ompl1/ <dig> and ompl1/ <dig> groups are the most prevalent strains in china.

in this study, immunization with either rompl1/ <dig>  rompl1/ <dig> or rompl1/ <dig> proteins could enhance significantly survival of guinea pigs lethally challenged with pathogenic leptospira species . the immunoprotective rates in the groups, in which animals received a rompl <dig> for immunization and challenge with the same ompl <dig> gene type, appeared to be higher than those being challenged with different ompl <dig> gene types.

in a previous study  <cit> , we found l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai could adhere to macrophages, and we here show that adherence to macrophages could be blocked with antisera against any of the rompl <dig> proteins, confirming cross-immunogenicity of ompl <dig> proteins from the three different groups. all these data collectively suggest that ompl <dig> is likely a genus-specific antigen.

CONCLUSIONS
ompl <dig> is a transmembrane protein extensively expressed in pathogenic leptospires. although the ompl <dig> gene can belong to any of three different gene types, the ompl <dig> proteins expressed by different gene types have conserved immunogenicity and the specific antibodies generally exist in sera of leptospirosis patients. ompl <dig> should thus be viewed as a potential candidate of genus-specific antigen for the development of new universal vaccines and serodiagnostic methods for leptospirosis.
