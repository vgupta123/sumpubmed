BACKGROUND
the most common short-chain fatty acids  are natural microbial fermentation products in the gastrointestinal tract. scfa, including propionic, butyric and valeric acids, each with three, four and five carbons, respectively, contribute to the energy balance of all mammalian species  <cit> . the major sources of these carbohydrates are hemicelluloses and fiber, which consists of plant cell wall polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectins  <cit> . in ruminants, scfa are a major energy source and contribute up to 70% of their energy requirements  <cit> . beyond their nutritional impact, scfa, especially butyrate, have a multitude of cellular regulatory effects that modulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and motility. all three major components of scfa induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, however, butyrate has the most potent effect  <cit> . roles for butyrate have been established in cell differentiation, proliferation, motility and in particular induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis is a genetically regulated cellular suicide mechanism that plays a crucial role in development and in the defense of homeostasis of animals  <cit> . the mechanism by which butyrate induces cellular differentiation and suppresses growth has not been elucidated. similarly, the mechanism through which butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids induce the cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic effects and the mechanism by which the decision between cell death and survival is arbitrated are poorly understood  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , potential biological roles of butyrate were investigated using the established madin-darby bovine kidney epithelial cell line . the study focused on determining whether normal bovine cells in a standard cell culture condition were sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of butyrate. the data suggested that sodium butyrate  could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in mdbk cells. up to 38% of cells became apoptotic after  <dig> hours of treatment with  <dig> mm of butyrate. butyrate also blocked the surviving cells at two distinct stages, g <dig> and m/g <dig>  however, more studies are needed to better understand the relationship between butyrate and alterations in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. recent advances in high-throughput genomic tools such as microarray technology allowed us to examine the genome-wide effects of sodium butyrate on mdbk cells.

RESULTS
butyrate induces cell cycle arrest and hyperacetylation of histone  <dig> in mdbk cells
we previously reported that butyrate induced cell cycle arrest in mdbk cells  <cit> . prior to microarray analysis, the butyrate induced cell cycle arrest was reconfirmed. as shown in figure  <dig>  after butyrate treatment for  <dig> h, cell population profiles changed significantly. in the surviving cell population there was a significant increase in the number of cells in g <dig>  whereas those in s phase  were decreased. this result confirmed our prior observation that cells were arrested at the g1/s boundary and dna replication was blocked by the butyrate treatment. we also confirmed accumulation of acetylated histone  <dig>  due to the butyrate treatment . h <dig> acetylation was selected as the marker for the accumulation of acetylated histones because h <dig> is one of the core histones , and is highly conserved across a wide range of organisms. the antibody against the acetyl h <dig> is also readily available commercially. to determine whether these biochemical attributes of butyrate were also observed in mdbk cells, two specific antibodies, the monoclonal antibody against the acetyl h <dig> and the monoclonal antibody against acetyl-phospho h <dig>  were used to evaluate the histone deacetylase inhibitory activity of butyrate. histone deacetylase  inhibitors induce the hyperacetylation of nucleosomal histones. evidence suggested that h <dig> phosphorylation is restricted to a small fraction of highly acetylated h <dig> histones. h <dig> phosphorylation is cell cycle dependent and may be associated with induced fos and myc oncogenes. no evidence indicates h <dig> phosphorylation directly results from hadc inhibitory activities. as shown in fig.  <dig>  butyrate treatment induced not only accumulation of hyperacetylation of h <dig>  but also phosphor -acetyl  h <dig>  the quantified relative densities from the western blot show approximately a 2-fold increase of acetylated h <dig> protein and 2-fold increase of phosphor-acetyl h <dig> . therefore it is reasonable to assume the increase detected by the antibody against phosph-acetyl -h <dig> is mostly due to the acetylation of h <dig> induced by butyrate.

butyrate induces profound changes in gene expression in mdbk cells
in our previous study  <cit>  and prior to the current microarray experiment, we monitored butyrate induced cell death and cell cycle arrest in mdbk cells in a time/dose-dependent manner using flow cytometry and western blotting. for the purpose of this investigation and for determining the differential gene expression induced by butyrate, we selected a single dose proven to be able to generate maximum biological impacts in cell cycle arrest. due to research budget constraints, we selected only a single time point as the initial global expression screening. we intend to verify the genes identified with the microarray in a time/dose-dependent manner using real-time rt-pcr in subsequent studies. we identified  <dig> genes significantly regulated by sodium butyrate at a very stringent false discovery rate  = 0% . however, when relaxing the stringency threshold to fdr = 10%, which should still be acceptable in most cases, there were  <dig> genes significantly regulated . this percentage was consistent with a previous report  <cit>  in which the authors used cdna microarrays consisting of ~ <dig> sequences to demonstrate that approximately 7% of sequences assayed exhibited alteration by butyrate in human colon carcinoma cells.

cell cycle control
the single largest category of genes regulated by butyrate  was cell cycle control related . butyrate repressed the vast majority of these genes including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, histone deacetylases, helicases, chromosomal structure proteins as well as kinesins. ubiquitin conjugating enzyme e <dig> c was also down-regulated. however, max interacting protein  <dig>  was up-regulated  <dig> -fold by butyrate.

apoptosis and extracellular matrix
fourteen genes related to apoptosis and extracellular matrix  were significantly regulated by butyrate . generally, butyrate induced pro-apoptotic genes and repressed anti-apoptotic genes. inhibin, beta a  and adrenomedullin were among the induced genes while apoptosis inhibitors such as survivin and faim were down-regulated. interestingly, insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  was up-regulated while igf binding proteins  <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated. collagens, such as col5a <dig> and col3a <dig>  and extracellular matrix protein spondin  <dig> were repressed by butyrate while tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig>  was significantly up-regulated.

real-time rt pcr
thirty genes that represent different expression levels and functional classes were selected for real-time rt-pcr confirmation . the real-time pcr data generally confirmed the microarray analysis. linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong positive correlation between the two technological platforms with r =  <dig> .

discussion
cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic effects of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids at the cellular and molecular levels in normal bovine cells have not been studied thus far but would serve as a principle launch point to validate the need for further study of these phenomena in cattle. furthermore, utilization of particular signaling pathways in regulating cellular function or inducing gene expression appears to be dependent on, among other factors, the type of stimulus and cell examined. in our previous study, an important question asked and answered was whether normal bovine cells in a standard cell culture condition are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of butyrate <cit> . in this follow-up study, we utilize microarray technique to examine the genome-wide effects of sodium butyrate on mdbk cells as an important component of our efforts to understand the mechanisms of this phenomenon. our data presented in this report indicate that the effects of butyrate are mediated through coordinated changes in gene expression that are the outcome of interactions between transduction pathways. we identified  <dig> genes significantly regulated by sodium butyrate at a very stringent false discovery rate  = 0%. however, since many of the genes have no direct links to the cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, their involvement in these biological effects certainly warrants more investigation. therefore, instead of speculating, our discussion is concentrated primarily in cell cycle and apoptosis.

sodium butyrate  exerts a very broad range of effects on many biological pathways via its inhibitory ability on hdac. sb is a potent inducer of a g <dig> cell cycle arrest. it also provokes apoptosis by activating both the death receptor and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. it regulates the cell cycle via down-regulation of cyclins and activation of cdk  <cit> . in addition, it was reported that butyrate modulates host immune responses by activating neutrophils  <cit>  and enhancing il-4-dependent ige production  <cit> . butyrate has immune suppression  <cit>  and anti-inflammatory properties, in part by suppressing nuclear factor nf-Îºb activity  <cit> . regulation of enzymes involved in cytoskeleton and cell membranes by butyrate has also been reported  <cit> . the majority of its effects directly result from hdac inhibition. however, butyrate appears to be involved in signal transduction via its own receptor gpr <dig>  resulting in inosityl  <dig> ,5-triphosphate generation, intracellular ca2+ release, erk1/ <dig> activation, and inhibition of camp accumulation  <cit> . because of their ability to inhibit cell proliferation, hdac inhibitors  including butyrate have been extensively exploited as anti-tumor agents  <cit> . butyrate appears to have pleiotropic effects on various biological processes. the genes we identified , which fall within a broad range of functional categories, appeared to provide the molecular basis for its pleiotropic effects.

butyrate seems able to inhibit all class i hdacs  <cit> . it would be safe to assume that, like trichostatin a , butyrate can indeed inhibit the activities of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  even though butyrate may have a different mechanism of action. our studies suggested that butyrate indeed repressed histone deacetylase  <dig>  mrna expression. the missing link is why this inhibition of enzymatic activities in turn down-regulates their own expression in mrna levels. in mouse neural cells, it was observed that hdac inhibitors affect the expression of hdacs themselves  <cit> . in these cells, both tsa and sb indeed elevated the expression of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> whereas mrna levels of hdac  <dig> and hdac <dig> did not change. the mrna levels of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> were not detectable in these cells. while the mechanism and biological relevance of hdi regulation of hdac expression remains unclear, it appears that there indeed exists an auto-regulatory feedback loop to the expression of several hdacs after their activities are inhibited.

it appears that the effects of hdi such as tsa and sb on mmp  expression are specific to cell types. in mouse 3t <dig> fibroblasts, tsa represses mmp <dig> expression  <cit> , while in human colonic cells dhd/k <dig>  mmp production is inhibited by butyrate  <cit> . in ht <dig> tumor cells, both protein and mrna levels of timp <dig>  timp <dig>  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are increased by butyrate treatment  <cit> . based on their data of limited modulation of mmp by butyrate in human sw <dig> colon cancer cells  <cit> , emenaker et al suggested that scfa, such as those derived from dietary fiber, may protect against invasive colon cancer through stimulation of timp and inhibition of upa  activities rather than their effects on mmp activities. in the present study, we found that both timp <dig> and mmps, such as mmp <dig>  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  were induced by butyrate. the expression levels of timp <dig> induced by butyrate are similar  as detected by the three sequences that represent this gene on the microarray . however, changes in mmp levels were not considered significant due to the high stringency cutoff used in this study . the net effect of this induction on both mmps and their inhibitor  is still unclear. timp <dig> can promote apoptosis in an in vivo colorectal cancer model yet can protect b <dig> melanoma cells from apoptosis  <cit> . the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in controlling these distinctly opposing phenotypic effects of timp <dig> is of paramount importance.

insulin-like growth factor binding proteins  modulate igf action and regulate cell growth and apoptosis by preventing igf from interacting with their own receptors. in our study, insulin-like growth factor  was upregulated by sb, which is consistent with other published data  <cit> . our microarray and real-time rt-pcr results confirmed that igfbp <dig>  which has a 100-fold higher affinity for igf <dig> than igf <dig>  <cit> , was down-regulated by butyrate. it seems paradoxical that while igf <dig> is up-regulated significantly by sb, its highest affinity binding protein is down-regulated. our results may suggest different functions of various igfbp members in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression. it would be intriguing to see how igfbp exert their actions in cell growth and apoptosis via an igf-independent fashion.

despite the fact that the effect of hdac inhibitors such as sb on the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes, such as cyclins and cyclin-related kinase , were documented and a few attempts were made to use high-throughput approaches, such as microarrays  <cit> , differential display  <cit>  and sage, to study the effects of hdac inhibitors on cell cycle control, the extent of the effect of these inhibitors on cell proliferation and cell cycle has not been fully realized in part due to limited gene representation on these microarrays  <cit> . due to significant differences in gene representation, species, microarray platforms, and data analysis tools used in these studies, a direct comparison between our results and those published is seemingly difficult. in general, our results are in good agreement with published reports. for example, we detected ~8% of all genes were significantly regulated by butyrate in bovine mdbk cells, which is consistent with a previous report  <cit>  in which the authors used cdna microarray consisting of ~ <dig> sequences to demonstrate that approximately 7% of sequences assayed exhibited alteration by butyrate in human colon carcinoma cells. down-regulation of cyclins, pcna, cdks, and upregulation of igf <dig>  mmps, and timp <dig> were also confirmed by previous reports  <cit> . however, many genes, such as aurora kinases, bub <dig> and bub1b, centromere proteins, kinesins, max interacting protein  <dig> , minichromosomal maintenance deficient proteins , and spindle pole body components were not previously recognized to be regulated by sb. our efforts in this study are among the first to systematically categorize the butyrate-regulated genes related with cell cycle control with a genome-wide approach in farm animals. while the vast majority of these genes are down-regulated, mxi <dig> is up-regulated. as a key component of the mitotic checkpoint, mxi <dig> binds with max to form a sequence-specific dna-binding protein complex and acts as a transcriptional repressor. up-regulation of mxi <dig> by sb could result in down-regulation of cyclins, which in turn negatively regulates centromere proteins.

accumulation of cells with 2c and 4c dna contents suggests inhibition by butyrate of cell cycle at g <dig> and m/g <dig> phases and suggests that a common responding element in genes responsive to the treatment of butyrate is required for progression of both phases g <dig> and m/g <dig>  this observation is also consistent with the previous report that the inhibition of g <dig> progression by butyrate is not restricted to a specific mitogenic signaling pathway  <cit> , but may also include the inhibitory effect on initiation of dna replication. in this report, multiple genes such as minichromosome maintenance  proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as orc <dig>  are significantly down-regulated. the products of these genes has been shown to be rate limiting for initiation of dna replication in eukaryotic cell lines and are essential for the assembly of the pre-replication complex   <cit> . this finding indicates that in someway, butyrate treatment directly targets these genes and down regulates the genes that are essential for initiation of dna replication. cdc2/cdk <dig> and related cyclins are also significantly down-regulated. at least four roles have now been recognized for cyclin a activated cdk <dig> protein kinases in regulating cell cycle events. first, cdk2/cyclin a is responsible for activating pre-replication complexes at the beginning of s-phase in order to begin dna synthesis  <cit> . second, cdk1/cyclin a inhibits assembly of new pre-replication complexes during s-phase  <cit>  by inactivating cdc <dig>  <cit> . third, cdk2/cyclin a is required for the g <dig> to m-phase transition  <cit> . finally, li and depamphilis  <cit>  recently revealed that cdk1/cyclin a is required for preventing orc <dig> in mammals or orc in xenopus from binding to chromatin during mitosis. our results show that targeted destruction of cdc <dig> and cdc2/cdk <dig> may be involved in the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by butyrate. they are consistent with the growing body of evidence suggesting that disruption of the coordination between regulation of dna synthesis and cyclin-dependent kinase activity is an important feature of apoptosis. it is of importance and interest for us to understand the mechanism of how butyrate targets these genes and causes these changes in gene expressions. however, it will require a great deal of efforts and certainly is out of the scope of this report.

understanding the mechanism of butyrate in affecting apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation and especially the difference of its mode of action compared to other hdac inhibitors will facilitate designing novel and more potent hdac inhibitors that target specific cellular processes that are dysregulated in neoplastic cells. dissection of the pathways regulated by butyrate will provide a basis for better utilization of its anti-tumor, anti-metastatic, immune-mediating, and anti-inflammatory properties. in addition, butyrate has been shown to up-regulate transcription levels of muslins, which are the major components of gastrointestinal mucosa considered to be the first line of defense against pathogens  <cit> . because of its ability to affect functions of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophage  <cit>  and to activate neutrophils, butyrate and its related biological pathways could be manipulated to fight against gastrointestinal pathogens. up-regulation of glutathione s-transferases  <cit> , genes known to be involved in defense against oxidative stress, by butyrate provides evidence of a favorable modulation of toxicological defense systems. the results presented in this paper not only help to better dissect hdac inhibition and mechanism in apoptosis and cell cycle control but also help to understand ruminant metabolism and physiology, which in turn could lead to improvement in energy efficiency of cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
the present research identified  <dig> genes significantly regulated by sodium butyrate in bovine kidney epithelial cells. the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis were presented. the profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes. the results presented in this paper can provide clues on the mechanism of histone deacetylase inhibition by butyrate and resulting alterations in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. since butyrate functions as both a nutrient and signaling molecule regulating the cell growth and proliferation, these findings enable better recognition of the full range of roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation.
