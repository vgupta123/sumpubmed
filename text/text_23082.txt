BACKGROUND
most flowering plant species are hermaphrodites having both male and female sexual organs in the same flower. only about 6% of flowering plant species are dioecious with male and female flowers on separate individual plants. although the number of dioecious plants is small, they are widely distributed across different genera and families  <cit> . some important dioecious crops include asparagus, spinach, poplar, kiwi fruit, strawberry, pepper, and papaya. it is proposed that the dioecious species have been evolved from ancestral hermaphrodite species along with the evolution of sex chromosomes  <cit> . only a small number of plant sex chromosomes have been characterized at the cytological and molecular levels  <cit> . the dioecious plant species provide a unique opportunity for understanding the evolution of plant sex and sex chromosomes because of the co-existence of hermaphrodite, gynodioecious, androdioecious, dioecious, or even trioecious species and the possession in some families of sex chromosomes at various evolutionary stages  <cit> .

papaya is a trioecious species with three sex types: female, male, and hermaphrodite. sex determination in papaya has long been a subject of genetic studies. hofmeyr  <cit>  and storey  <cit>  independently reported that sex in papaya was under the control of a single gene with three alleles: m, male; mh, hermaphrodite; and m, female. any combination of the dominant alleles, mm, mmh, or mhmh, is lethal, resulting in heterogametic hermaphrodites  and males  and homogametic females . more recently, high density genetic mapping of the papaya genome revealed severe recombination suppression at a sex determination locus  <cit> . fine mapping and physical mapping of the sex determination locus validated suppression of recombination at the sex locus of  <dig> – 2 mb in length where no recombinant was detected  <cit> . survey sequencing of selected bacs on the physical map revealed increased repetitive sequences and decreased gene density compared with genome wide averages. these findings led to the conclusion that sex determination in papaya is controlled by a pair of incipient sex chromosomes  <cit> . integration of genetic and physical maps along with the genome sequence reveals that the suppression of recombination at the sex specific region. the recombination rates gradually resume to genome-wide average beyond the sex-specific region and then exceed the average by 7-fold, demonstrating the dynamics of recombination surrounding the hsy  <cit> . similar incipient sex chromosomes were also found in the flowering plants asparagus  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , and strawberry  <cit> .

male and hermaphrodite plants in papaya are controlled by two slightly different y chromosomes, y for males and yh for hermaphrodites, with sex chromosome genotypes xy and xyh, respectively. female plants have a sex chromosome genotype xx  <cit> . there is a non-recombining male- or hermaphrodite-specific region of the y or yh chromosome . the hsy was previously estimated to be about 4–5 mb in size  <cit> . the sex chromosomes of papaya evolved about 2– <dig> million years ago estimated by time divergence analysis of four pairs of homologous x-yh genes  <cit> . the msy and hsy shared  <dig> % sequence identity including repetitive sequences, and these two y chromosomes evolved from an ancestral y chromosome about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the x- and y/yh-specific sequences diverged extensively, sharing 84-86% sequence identity  <cit> . the two x only chromosomes are nearly identical, sharing  <dig> % sequence identity  <cit> . fluorescent in situ hybridization  reveals that the papaya hsy region spans about ~ 13% of the papaya yh chromosome with centromere embedded  <cit> . five heterochromatic knob structures are detected in the hsy, and among them, knobs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are hsy-specific and knob  <dig> is shared between x and hsy. these five knobs contain heavily methylated dna sequences. the centromere of yh chromosome appeared to be located on either side of knob  <dig>  <cit> .

complete sequencing of the hsy and the corresponding x regions in papaya is highly desirable as it would unveil the genomic features and evolutionary events of young sex chromosomes in plants. the draft genome sequence of sunup female plant provided the foundation for analyzing papaya genome composition, structure, and organization. it also facilitated the analysis of the papaya sex chromosomes  <cit> . the objectives of the present study are:  to construct separate physical maps of the hsy and its x counterpart with minimum tiling paths for sequencing the x- and yh-specific regions of the papaya sex chromosomes; and  to define the borders of hsy genetically by fine mapping using ssr and scar markers around the border with large f <dig> populations.

RESULTS
physical mapping of hsy
physical mapping started with screening the hermaphrodite bac library using the sex co-segregating sequence characterized amplified region  marker w <dig> by which four positive bacs were identified. the bac end sequences  of all four positive bacs were used for sorting out the configuration to select the two most extended ends as probes for the next round of screening of the bac library. this stepwise chromosome walking process produced an hsy contig of about  <dig> kb.

additional sex co-segregating markers were used for screening the bac library to establish multiple start points to extend the physical map, which greatly improved hsy chromosome walking that was hindered by highly repetitive sequences. eighty five of the  <dig> sex co-segregating aflp markers had sufficient distance from neighboring bands and fragment size  to be suitable for southern hybridization. these  <dig> markers were excised from aflp gels to develop carica papaya sex-liked markers . sixty three of the  <dig> fragments were re-amplified using the original aflp primers. these  <dig> cpsms were hybridized to the hermaphrodite bac library, and  <dig> yielded positive hits. among the  <dig> hybridized markers,  <dig> identified bacs that were either in the existing contig or formed new contigs. the remaining  <dig> probes hit numerous bacs indicating that they contained repetitive sequences. the library screening using cpsm resulted in five contigs with a combined size of  <dig>  mb  <cit> .

physical mapping was further assisted by sequencing selected seven bacs that were confirmed by fish on the yh <cit> . these seven clones served as anchors, or start points, for chromosome walking to extend the physical map and to build the minimum tiling path. when the genome wide physical map based on fingerprints of the entire hermaphrodite bac library became available  <cit> , bacs on a minimum tiling path were selected and validated by multiple pcr amplification, and the bacs at the extreme ends of the existing contigs were used as seeds to search for contigs in the physical map. the genomewide physical map coupled with bac end sequences  accelerated construction of the hsy physical map. at this stage, higher stringency selection criteria were applied when adding new bac clones:  primers from one of the bes of the candidate extension clone must amplify the anchor/seed bac clone and vice versa;  at least two pcr product sequences show 100% match in the overlapping region between the candidate bac and the established bac in the physical map;  one or both bes of the candidate show male-specificity ;  ultimately, candidate bac clones have to be confirmed to be on the yh chromosome by fish  <cit> .

four  of the five heterochromatic knob structures that were yh-specific  <cit>  were positioned on the physical map . unmapped knob  <dig>  the only knob structure shared between the yh and x chromosomes, located in the gap between knob  <dig> and border a. chromosome walking to close this gap kept landing to the x chromosome and thus could not fill the gap. the last two bacs at the end of the contig bearing knob  <dig>  sh62e <dig> and sh61k <dig>  were confirmed by fish to be on the x chromosome .

the physical map of hsy reached about  <dig>  mb from four contigs with the remaining three gaps. multiple attempts to close the gaps by re-hybridization of probes from the extreme ends of contigs to the hermaphrodite bac library were unsuccessful. two new bac libraries were constructed using different restriction enzymes, one from male au <dig> and the other from female sunup  <cit>  for the screening. two of the three gaps were filled by screening the male au <dig> bac library, one with am126g <dig> and the other with am57m <dig>  a third male au <dig> bac, am125i <dig>  extended the contig for the remaining gap. this bac was confirmed to be on the yh chromosome, even though the seed bac 61k <dig> was on the x chromosome. the final version of the hsy physical map was now about  <dig>  mb, excluding shared border sequences with x chromosome .

a total of  <dig> pcr-amplified probes was used for library screening and primers used for designing probes were used again for further confirmation of positive clones and cross amplification for configuration during chromosome walking . unfortunately, a majority of those positive clones from library screening had been eliminated due to less than maximal extension, redundancy, or more likely being false positive as a result of repetitive elements or the initial low stringency library screening. a minimum bac tiling path containing  <dig> anchored bacs  was built on the basis of the several lines of evidence during chromosome walking as described in the methods section.

physical mapping of the hsy corresponding region in the x chromosome
two x chromosome-specific bac clones, sh53e <dig>  and sh61h <dig> , previously isolated through the presence of x-specific sequences, showed high sequence identity  to genic regions of two hsy bacs, sh 95b <dig> and sh85b <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these two x bacs were used as seed bacs to start chromosome walking on the x counterpart on both directions simultaneously. new seed bacs were identified based on sex-co-segregating ssr markers from the draft genome of female sunup  <cit> . for example, the source sequence of the sex-co-segregating ssr marker, p6k697y <dig>  aligned with the end sequences of sh30b <dig> with 99% identity, and the sh30b <dig> were used as new starting points for chromosome walking on both directions until overlapping bac clones were identified or the gaps were filled. in addition to the basic chromosome walking steps applied for the hsy, we also applied in silico chromosome walking using sequence data from the draft genome of female papaya  <cit>  for physical mapping of the x chromosome . bac clones, sh12i <dig>  sh12g <dig>  sh99b <dig>  and sh23d <dig> were all identified through in silico chromosome walking.

two contigs were built with one gap remaining after exhausting the genomic resources, including the draft genome, physical map, and bes. attempting to fill the gap  was not successful. the remaining gap on the x physical map was closed on the hsy physical map. the gap of the hsy physical map between border a and knob  <dig> was filled on the x physical map. the bac used to identify knob  <dig> by fish was mapped in the region near border a of the x chromosome map.

the physical map of the x counterpart consists of  <dig> sh-bacs, including  <dig> border bacs shared between hsy and x. the minimum tiling path of the x-specific region contains  <dig> bacs, spanning about  <dig>  mb, and with a gap remaining between am136d <dig> and sf08k <dig> .

physical mapping of borders a and b
mapping the borders of the non-recombining hsy ensures the completeness of the hsy and its corresponding x physical maps. two bacs, sh85c <dig> and sh86b <dig>  were identified first through chromosome walking for the hsy physical map. soon after, we identified the same extended bacs in the x chromosome walking process, suggesting that the location of this shared bac clones might be in the border region. concurrently, sex-linked ssr markers were used to identify more clones at the two border regions. two sex-linked ssr markers , showed genetic distances of  <dig> and 3 cm from the non-recombining hsy, respectively, one on each side the hsy. these two markers were used to retrieve the source sequences in the draft genome. the associated bac clone sh94g <dig> was designated as border a and sh68n <dig> was designated as border b of the hsy region. bac sh68n <dig> at border b was physically about 1 mb away from sh86b <dig> and in the same fingerprint map as sh86b <dig> . therefore, the minimal tiling path between these two bacs was established by the fingerprint map being confirmed by cross amplification among the overlapped bacs . bac sh94g <dig> at border a was almost imbedded in sh69a <dig>  another large clone about 345 kb in size. sh69a <dig> was used as a seed bac for chromosome walking in both directions until sh54a <dig> was identified, which overlapped with the x bac clone, sh84m <dig> during chromosome walking. however, a gap remained unfilled between border a and the hsy physical map, specifically between sh54a <dig> and am125i <dig>  . attempt to fill the gap had identified clones that were all on x chromosome without any evidence of being yh-specific. this region contains knob  <dig>  the only knob structure shared between x and hsy.

defining the borders of hsy via fine mapping
the method used to genetically define the hsy borders started with the sex-linked ssr marker cpm1055c <dig> on border a and p3k2608c <dig> on border b to search for recombinants between them among  <dig> progeny of f <dig> population. four recombinants were identified at the cpm1055c <dig> locus at border a only from the progeny of the cross au <dig> x sunup, because there were no polymorphic markers near cpm1055c <dig> in the other f <dig> populations. eighty-seven recombinants were obtained for border b . the kapoho x sunup populations exhibited the highest rate of recombination rate at the p3k2608c <dig> locus with  <dig>  % of the progeny, the au <dig> x sunup progeny had a recombination rate of  <dig>  %, and the uh <dig> x sunup dwarf cross had the lowest at  <dig>  %.

seventy-five ssr markers  were developed from the available bes and the draft genome sequences near the border regions to define the non-recombining region . five of the  <dig> markers were polymorphic in the au <dig> x sunup mapping population, in order from the distal region of border a to the sex determining region: spctg177-12a, 84m10ctg-34a and -34b, 54 m22-bacs-636a, and 54 m22-bacs0-716b. the spctg177-12a marker identified two recombinants among 98 f <dig> progeny of the au <dig> x sunup family while the other four polymorphic markers co-segregated with sex. these results suggested that border a is located between spctg177-12a and 84m10ctg-34a/b, i.e. between bacs sh52f <dig> and sh84m <dig> .

two of  <dig> ssr markers: 58 c24-25b and borderb-2001a were polymorphic at border b. borderb-2001a identified three recombinants among the  <dig> previously identified ones. these three recombinants were then mapped using the 58 c24-25b marker which located inside borderb-2001a. only one recombinant was detected . no recombinations were observed at the position of a more inner sex-co-segregating marker, p3k <dig>  suggesting that border b was located between 58 c24–25b and p3k <dig>  within bac sh58c <dig> . therefore, the total hsy region was defined genetically to lie between bacs sh84m <dig> and sh85c <dig> 

discussion
an important finding from the hsy and x physical maps is the rapid expansion of the hsy in the past 2– <dig> million years after genetic recombination became suppressed in the sex determining region. the hsy physical map contains about  <dig>  mb yh-specific sequences with the distinctive cytological feature of having four yh-specific knobs. in contrast, the hsy counterpart x is only  <dig>  mb in size, excluding the 900 kb region of knob  <dig> which is shared with the hsy. the 89% expansion of physical size in hsy indicates rapid expansion of y-specific sequences in the early stages of sex chromosome evolution. given sufficient time, the x and y may evolve into morphologically distinctive chromosomes, from each other and from autosomes. thus the y chromosome would become significantly larger than the x, as is the case with the young sex chromosomes of silene latifolia that evolved about 10– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . similarly, the medaka fish msy exhibited  <dig> % dna sequence expansion  <cit>  while the stickleback y-specific bac sequence showed 37% expansion compared with their x sequence  <cit> . expansion of the y chromosome in papaya has progressed until most gene content will be lost by the time when the y starts a contraction phase of sex chromosome evolution  <cit> .

the four yh-specific heterochromatic knobs might account for a large portion of the hsy expansion, mostly by retrotransposon insertions, as evident by the 85% repetitive sequences in hsy versus 60% in its x counterpart  <cit> . the hsy is much larger than our original estimate of 4–5 mb which was based on the 57% sex co-segregating sequence characterized amplified region  markers embedded in the then  <dig>  mb physical map of hsy  <cit> . the aflp derived scar markers were developed from markers that were polymorphic between the female and hermaphrodite parents. these polymorphic and sex co-segregating markers might be enriched in yh specific sequences, such as the four knobs, causing the underestimate of the physical size of hsy.

we could not identify a region in the papaya x chromosome that corresponds to the knob  <dig> in hsy. moreover, the distance between knob  <dig> and the corresponding region of knob  <dig> on the x chromosome was much shorter than the distance between knobs  <dig> to  <dig> on hsy. knob <dig>  represented by sh99o <dig> on hsy, was highly hsy-specific, indicating accumulation of novel sequences after recombination was suppressed by retrotransposon insertions, translocations, and perhaps other chromosomal rearrangements.

the mapping of border bacs that are not distinguishable between x and yh allowed us to develop additional markers from the draft genome and from sequencing of selected bacs to genetically define the borders of hsy. four f <dig> populations with a total of  <dig> individuals were analyzed for ssr markers near the borders to identify recombinants. only seven of the  <dig> ssr markers developed were polymorphic for the four pairs of parent papaya cultivars . at border a, all five polymorphic markers were found in only one  of the four f <dig> populations. our finding of more polymorphism at border a in the au <dig> x sunup family than in the others is supported by the report that sunup and au <dig> are more distantly related than are the other cultivars  <cit> . a total of  <dig> recombinants were found at border b from initial screening using the ssr marker p3k <dig>  a significant reduction of recombination was observed in all populations near the border b region between p3k <dig>  and borderb-2001a , a distance of  <dig>  mb. our finding of very little recombination in all populations reinforces the numerous reports that sex determination regions are characterized by suppression of recombination. the hsy region was genetically defined to lie between the two ssr markers, spctg177-12a in border a bac sh52f <dig> and 58 c24–25b in border b bac sh58c <dig> 

despite numerous attempts, even when utilizing an additional male au <dig> bac library, the gap between border a and hsy remained unfilled. chromosome walking on hsy kept jumping to land on the x chromosome. this  <dig> kb region is where knob  <dig> is located, the only knob structure shared between the x and yh chromosomes  <cit> . it is likely that the jump from hsy to x while walking is due to higher dna sequence homology between the x and yh at knob  <dig> than in other parts of the chromosome due to the paucity of yh-specific sequences near knob  <dig>  for these reasons, the region of knob  <dig> could be beyond the hsy, even though we were not able to detect any recombination in this region. suppression of recombination in this region could be the results of heterochromatic sequence in knob  <dig>  this gap on the hsy was filled on the physical map of the x counterpart.

for a genomic region like the hsy that is rich in repetitive sequences, it is unusual that the  <dig>  mb physical map of hsy could be assembled into only one contig. this success might have been facilitated by the large average insert size of  <dig> kb of the second batch of the hermaphrodite sunup bac library  <cit> . this possibility is apparent by noting that the bacs mapped on the hsy and x physical map frequently contain large inserts  .

although there is no gap in the border regions of the physical map of the x counterpart there is one within the map. we made substantial efforts to close this gap using two additional bac libraries, one from male au <dig> and one from female sunup. we also used the draft genome of female sunup  <cit> , but the gap remained. when comparing the physical maps and knob locations of hsy and x, it appears that the gap within the x physical map may correspond to knob  <dig> of hsy . based on cytological fish results, hsy bac sh52h <dig> of knob  <dig> mapped to the most terminal position compared to the other four knobs at metaphase i. authors of that report suggested that the centromere of the yh chromosome is located between knobs  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the gap we were unable to fill on the physical map of the x counterpart could be the centromere of the x chromosome. interestingly, this gap was filled on the physical map of hsy, so it is possible that we have fine mapped its centromere. if so, this is a surprise as most centromeres are highly repetitive and heterochromatic, very difficult to map or sequence, as has been repeatedly reported by genome sequencing projects of multiple organisms  <cit> . to date, the centromere of rice chromosome  <dig>  is the only reported sequenced centromere in plants  <cit> . rice cen <dig> contains active genes and is at an early stage of centromere evolution, evolving from a neocentromere to a mature centromere. if the centromere of the yh chromosome is indeed between knobs  <dig> and  <dig>  we may have been able to fine map it because it is atypical, perhaps a recently evolved centromere.

complete sequencing of the papaya hsy and its x counterpart is the first step towards identification of the sex determination gene, which could lead to engineering a true breeding hermaphrodite variety without the yh chromosome. in addition, the sequences of papaya sex chromosomes would be the first one in plants, and the third y chromosome to be sequenced including the y chromosomes of humans and the chimpanzee  <cit> . physical mapping of a region without recombination is a challenging task, and our task was further confounded by a potentially embedded centromere and highly repetitive, heterochromatic sequences. the trioecious nature of papaya and genomic resources already developed for it expedited our sequencing efforts. it was possible to construct an hsy and corresponding x map only through having the three bac libraries representing the three sex types of papaya, a collection of bes from the hermaphrodite bac library, a genome wide physical map, and an annotated draft genome  <cit> . fish validation proved crucial to ensure that we were walking on the correct molecule.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied a reiterate chromosome walking strategy and constructed the physical maps for the heterchromatic hsy and its x counterpart. the non-recombination region between hsy and x was defined genetically by fine mapping to ensure the complete coverage of these two physical maps in papaya. the hsy expanded rapidly comparing to it x counterpart in  <dig> –  <dig> million years. the previously identified five heterochromatic knob structures were all covered, four in the map of hsy and one in the map of x counterpart. these two physical maps will serve as templates for complete sequencing of the sex determination region in papaya. the sequencing of hsy and its x corresponding region is being completed using the minimum tiling path of these two physical maps.
