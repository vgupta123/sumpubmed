BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen causing wound and skin infections, endocarditis and bacteremia  <cit> . it has long been recognized that healthy individuals may be colonized on skin and mucosae, the most frequent carriage site in humans being the anterior nares  <cit> . longitudinal studies have demonstrated the existence of three s. aureus nasal carriage patterns, i.e., persistent carriers , non-carriers  and intermittent carriers   <cit> . there is evidence showing that nasal carriage is associated with a higher risk of s. aureus infection  <cit> . colonization of the host is a complex process which is influenced by host factors, bacterial factors, and environmental factors . although the heritability of s. aureus carriage was not significant in two human studies  <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with nasal carriage have been found for several candidate genes, e.g., c-reactive protein , interleukin  <dig> , and glucocorticoid receptor  . in addition, genetic loci associated with susceptibility to s. aureus infection have been reported in murine studies  <cit> . collectively, these studies suggest that host gene variants underlie differences in susceptibility to s. aureus colonization. however, candidate gene studies suffer from the limitation that they only assess the effects of specific genes picked by the researcher based on hypothesized involvement in disease etiology. in contrast, genome-wide association studies  survey the entire genome, and many of the associations found in gwas identify novel candidate genes  <cit> .

pigs and other livestock species carrying methicillin-resistant s. aureus  clonal complex   <dig> may act as a source of human colonization and infection  <cit> . spread of this livestock-associated mrsa clone is presently regarded as a threat to public health, and effective control measures preventing transmission of mrsa to farmers and other people exposed to livestock are urgently needed  <cit> . a recent longitudinal study revealed that a minority of pigs characterized by high nasal load and stable carriage may be responsible for the maintenance of s. aureus within farms  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to detect loci associated with nasal carriage of s. aureus. danish crossbreds classified as persistent carriers  and non-carriers  were genotyped by gwas using illumina’s porcine snp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . a single snp on chromosome  <dig> was found to be genome-wide significant after permutation testing. the region of interest was inspected and we identified four candidate genes which may control s. aureus colonization in pigs.

methods
phenotypic characterization of pigs
our study population comprised  <dig> persistent carriers and  <dig> non-carriers from  <dig> farms located in the central part of jutland, denmark  and  <dig> non-spf farms). most pigs were phenotyped in the previous longitudinal study  <cit>  and  <dig> additional pigs were recruited for this study on four of the farms surveyed in the longitudinal study. nasal swabs  were collected from all pigs three times on a weekly basis. pigs that were s. aureus-positive on all three sampling points were classified as persistent carriers whereas non-carriers were negative on at least two sampling points and with no more than 100 cfu/swab in the remaining sample. in order to ensure exposure to a minimum colonization pressure, non-carriers were included only if they originated from farms where at least one persistent carrier was detected. the distribution of persistent carriers and non-carriers among farms is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all pigs were crossbreeds  of approximately 70 kg. pedigree details were not available but since the farmers used mixed semen to produce the offspring, the sample was expected to comprise a mixture of half-sibs  and more distantly related pigs.

according to danish laws  no ethical approval was required for this study since the blood samples collected from the animals were taken for diagnostic purposes. all procedures concerning the animals were part of routine examinations and diagnosis of animals normally used at production farms. all handling of animals was performed by trained personnel and veterinarians.

genotyping of pigs
to detect qtls associated with s. aureus carrier status, we genotyped all pigs using diagnostic blood samples collected in edta tubes . dna was extracted using either a salting out procedure with minor modifications  <cit>  or masterpure™ complete dna and rna purification kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the concentration and purity of dna was measured on a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . 2500 ng of each sample was submitted for genotyping to geneseek, inc. . samples were genotyped for  <dig>  snps using illumina’s porcine snp <dig> beadchip  <cit> .

isolation and genotyping of s. aureus
to study possible relationships between host and s. aureus genotypes, s. aureus was isolated from  <dig> persistent carriers whose nasal swabs had been stored at−80 °c in the previous study  <cit> . swabs were directly plated onto saselect agar  and enriched in müller-hinton broth containing  <dig>  % of nacl to enhance s. aureus detection. after overnight incubation one presumptive s. aureus colony was randomly selected for each sampling point. additional colonies were isolated if they had clear morphological features suggesting the presence of different strains on the same plate. if s. aureus was not detected by direct plating, the enrichments were further processed as described above. all isolates were characterized by spa typing  <cit>  and spa types were assigned using ridom staphtype software, version  <dig> . <dig> . associations between spa types and clonal complexes  were determined according to information available in the scientific literature. for spa types not previously associated to a clonal complex, burp cluster analysis  was used to infer association  <cit> .

statistical analyses
data were analyzed in r version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . genotype data were analyzed and visualized using the genabel package  <cit>  except for manhattan plots which were made using the qqman package  <cit> . snps were excluded prior to analysis if genome position was not provided  or if they were located on sex chromosomes . snp genotype data were subjected to quality control  measures. genabel applies qc filters using an iterative process; for individuals we used the following criteria, call rates >  <dig> , false discovery rate  for unacceptably high heterozygosity <  <dig>  and identity-by-state  <  <dig>  ; for snps we used the following criteria , call rate >  <dig>  , minor allele frequency  >  <dig>  , and snps in hardy-weinberg equilibrium with p-values >  <dig>  . after qc a total of  <dig>  autosomal snps mapped to build sscrofa  <dig>  and  <dig> individuals  were included in the final analysis.

we estimated the average relatedness between pigs by computing an n × n marker-based genomic kinship matrix for all pairs of pigs. kinship coefficients between two individuals  were estimated using  <dig>  autosomal snps which had passed qc as described elsewhere  <cit> . the genomic kinship matrix was transformed to a distance matrix which was then subjected to multidimensional scaling analysis and plotted in two dimensions   <cit> .

the association between snp genotype and nasal carriage of s. aureus  was tested in genabel using an allelic association test with  <dig> df. we included farm as a covariate in the model. to adjust for multiple testing with a high number of snps, we derived the empirical distribution of the chi-square statistic after  <dig>  permutations of the whole dataset. genome-wide significance was set to empirical p-values <  <dig> . we used genomic control  <cit>  to adjust for any inflation of the test statistic. calculations of linkage disequilibrium  and visualization of ld were performed in haploview version  <dig>   <cit> . since the annotation of the pig genome sequence is incomplete, we also interrogated the human orthologue of the candidate region  using builds sscrofa <dig>  and grch <dig> accessed through the ensembl genome browser .

the association between total number of spa types colonizing over the three-week period  and snp marc <dig> genotype  was tested using fisher’s exact test for count data. we tested if colonization by each clonal complex  was non-random among snp marc <dig> genotypes using fisher’s exact test for count data. in addition to the genotype model, we also tested a dominance/recessive model .

RESULTS
the  <dig>  snps which passed quality testing were used to compute a genomic kinship matrix for all pairs of pigs . inspection of the matrix suggested that the pigs in our sample were only distantly related. we next applied multidimensional scaling to a distance matrix calculated from the genomic kinship matrix . the plot did not suggest any stratification of data with respect to s. aureus carriage  or farm . we constructed a quantile-quantile plot  and calculated the genomic inflation factor  which also confirmed that genetic confounding was not an issue in our dataset.fig.  <dig> from left to right: a distribution of genomic relationships between pairs of pigs . b multidimensional scaling plot .  <dig>  non-carriers;  <dig>  persistent carriers; pc, principal component. c quantile-quantile plot. black line, the expected distribution of association test statistics under the null hypothesis of no association is plotted against observed values. any deviation from the x-y line suggests a consistent difference between persistent carriers and non-carriers e.g., due to genetic confounding. at the extreme of the distribution, the observed chi-square values are higher than expected by chance which indicates true association. red line, fitted slope



a gwas was performed on the final dataset . one locus  on porcine chromosome  <dig> demonstrated association with carriage of s. aureus. the effect was genome-wide significant after permutation testing . a neighboring snp, alga <dig>  in high ld with marc <dig> , did not reach genome-wide significance but was borderline significant after permutation testing . these two snps are both located in an intergenic region.fig.  <dig> manhattan plots for gwas of nasal staphylococcus aureus carriage in danish crossbred pigs. the analysis included  <dig> non-carriers and  <dig> persistent carriers which were genotyped at  <dig>  autosomal snps. p-values were corrected using lambda statistic to account for genetic confounding. upper figure shows raw p-values; a suggestive significance threshold

to define the haplotype structure within the region, ld blocks were analyzed using haploview. the measures of pairwise ld are shown in fig.  <dig> where block  <dig> indicates a region of 234 kb showing ld with snp marc <dig>  the proposed candidate region is flanked by snp markers asga <dig> and alga <dig>  both showing no or weak ld with block  <dig>  thus, the two snps  delineate a haplotype block and since ld to flanking markers is weak we conservatively use these flanking markers as coordinates and delineate our qtl to ssc12:  <dig> ,021– <dig> , <dig>  with the limitations of the annotation of the porcine genome assembly, this qtl encompasses four annotated genes encoding chemokines .fig.  <dig> linkage disequilibrium  plot showing r <dig> x 100-values  with standard haploview color scheme . block  <dig> indicates a region of 234 kb showing ld with snp marc <dig>  the proposed candidate region is flanked by snp markers asga <dig> and alga <dig>  both showing no or week ld to block 1



the following  <dig> spa types were observed among the 126 s. aureus isolates from persistent carriers : t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , and t <dig> . thirteen pigs  were found to carry the same strain throughout the study, while the remaining  <dig> pigs carried either two  or three  different strains . the identified spa types have previously been associated with cc <dig>  , cc <dig>   <cit>  and cc <dig>   <cit> . we did not find any reported clonal complex association for spa type t <dig>  which belonged to cc <dig> according to burp cluster analysis. the association between snp marc <dig> and host colonization was independent of s. aureus genotype.

discussion
to our knowledge the work presented here is the first attempt to decipher the host genetic factors involved in nasal carriage of s. aureus in pigs. the gwas demonstrated a significant association between a snp marker located in a non-coding region  and nasal carriage of s. aureus, while the association of a nearby polymorphism in high ld with snp marc <dig>  was borderline significant. regardless, the results presented here are preliminary and the association should be replicated in other pigs to confirm the findings.

the frequency of the g allele at the snp marc <dig> locus was twice as high in carrier pigs compared to non-carriers of s. aureus . the majority  of the  <dig> genotyped pigs that were homozygous for the a allele were non-carriers of s. aureus while the majority  that were homozygous for the g allele were persistent carriers, suggesting that the g allele is associated with susceptibility to nasal carriage of s. aureus. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> pigs were heterozygotes in the group of persistent- and non-carriers, respectively. since both snps are located in a non-coding part of the genome, our results indicate that the haplotype tagged by these two snps contains one or several genes with an effect on s. aureus nasal carriage.

we used the ensembl genome browser to interrogate our region of interest  and the human orthologue of the region of interest . inspection of our ~1 mb qtl region revealed that it encompasses a cluster of four chemokine genes . a causative variant may be a snp located in an exon of a protein-coding gene , a regulatory part of a gene , or a copy-number variant of a gene  <cit> . chemokines are expressed by a variety of cells to help direct immune cells of the innate and adaptive branch of the immune system to the site of foreign antigen  <cit> . there is evidence suggesting some of our candidate chemokines may be invoked following bacterial colonization; s. aureus antigens have been shown to stimulate expression of ccl <dig> by dendritic cells  <cit>  while another study demonstrated human alveolar epithelial cells produced ccl <dig> following stimulation by lps, a component of the gram-negative cell wall  <cit> . ccl <dig> has chemotactic properties for monocytes  <cit> ; indeed, recruitment of macrophages required expression of the ccl2-binding chemokine receptor  <dig> in a mouse model of steptococcus pneumoniae colonization  <cit> . ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> had direct antimicrobial activity against s. aureus while ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> did not have any effect on this pathogen  <cit> .

the host factors underlying the differences in s. aureus carriage are not yet fully understood  <cit> . studies in a murine model have suggested s. aureus clearance is t-cell mediated and happens via an il-17a-dependent recruitment of neutrophils  <cit> . while the adaptive immune response was found to be important, these authors were not able to demonstrate that b-cells were crucial. in agreement with these findings there is evidence showing that immunity to pneumococcal colonization is antibody independent but does require cd4+ t cells  <cit> .

research in humans and murine models using infection with s. aureus as phenotypic trait have suggested different positional candidate genes, e.g., seh1l, tnfaip <dig>  klk, and cdon  <cit> . however, none of these genes are situated in or close to our qtl region. genetic studies in human populations are challenged by a considerable genetic heterogeneity which may explain why previous efforts have shown a non-significant heritability of nasal carriage of s. aureus  <cit> . in contrast, pigs may be used as a convenient model since they are much less heterogeneous and smaller sample sizes are needed to detect genetic variants associated with complex traits  <cit> . the pig model may be used to further explore s. aureus colonization mechanisms in humans; e.g., by taking advantage of the possibility to control various factors under experimental settings .

gwas for host susceptibility to infectious pathogens should take the genome of the microorganism, i.e., strain information, into account  <cit> . this notion is particularly relevant to s. aureus colonization, which is the result of a complex interplay between host and bacterial factors . all s. aureus spa types identified in the present study have previously been isolated from pigs  <cit>  except t <dig>  which has only been reported in cattle  <cit> . cc398-associated spa types were isolated from most  persistent carriers, suggesting that cc <dig> is the most prevalent s. aureus lineage in danish crossbreed pigs. even though the study was not designed to study coexistence of different lineages in the nasal cavity of pigs , our results show that persistent carriers can be colonized by several lineages during a period of three weeks and by more than one strain at the same time.

the association between snp marc <dig> and host colonization was independent of s. aureus genotype. this is valuable information considering that s. aureus is a highly clonal microorganism and one clonal lineage  accounts for most livestock-associated mrsa infections in europe  <cit> . identification of genetic markers associated with nasal carriage of s. aureus may be used in breeding to select animals with reduced susceptibility to colonization by this organism. such a breeding program may serve as an unexplored option to prevent spread of livestock-associated mrsa to humans. a similar approach was used to detect the locus responsible for enterotoxigenic e. coli diarrhea in piglets, and a genetic marker test which distinguishes between susceptible and resistant animals has been developed  <cit> . the findings presented here may also improve our understanding of the host mechanisms underlying s. aureus colonization in both pigs and humans. the new locus detected in the present study provides a basis for further exploration by validation and functional testing of the markers and candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified significant association between a snp marker located in a non-coding region  and nasal carriage of s. aureus. the qtl region encompasses a cluster of four chemokine genes  which are potential candidate genes for nasal carrige. our results suggest it may be possible to select pigs genetically resistant to s. aureus nasal colonization as a tool to control transmission of livestock-associated mrsa to humans.
