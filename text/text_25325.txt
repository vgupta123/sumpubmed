BACKGROUND
rooting capability is one of the economically important traits that are lost during the juvenile-to-mature phase change in woody plants. the difficulties in propagation of promising clones of woody plants, such as rootstocks of fruit trees, ornamental woody plants, and forest trees, hampers breeding programs that depend on the production of rooted cuttings.

the process of maturation in plants is characterized by progressive changes in various morphological and developmental traits, among which is ars formation . the following four phases have been defined in plant development:  embryonic phase,  postembryonic juvenile vegetative phase,  mature vegetative phase, and  mature reproductive phase  <cit> . in woody plants, the juvenile traits, including rooting capability, are expressed at the base of the stem throughout the life of the plant and are sharply or gradually replaced by maturity traits, including rooting inability, toward the upper part of the main stem and branches  <cit> .

ar formation is a complex process, in which roots differentiate and regenerate from non-root tissues  <cit> , and is often described to occur in four steps:  cell de-differentiation,  cell division,  development of root primordia, and  root emergence. auxin plays a major role in each of these steps  <cit> . histological analysis of woody plants induced to form ar revealed that cell division  is induced in both juvenile and mature tissues, but differentiation of root primordia  occurs efficiently in juvenile cuttings but is compromised in mature cuttings . mature cuttings have often been reported to produce callus tissue instead of root primordia.

data have been accumulated using dna-chip analysis regarding the molecular regulation of ar formation in woody plants. in poplar , the expression of genes related to ethylene-biosynthesis pathway, auxin-response factors , iaa family members, and cytokinin-regulated transcripts was reported to change during the first 48 h following root induction  <cit> . the expression of few genes was modified in transgenic poplar plants overexpressing the cytokinin-response regulator ptrr <dig>  in which ar formation was inhibited  <cit> . these included the gene encoding pleiotropic drug resistance transporter  <dig> , which is involved in auxin efflux, the genes encoding fimbrin-like <dig> , an actin-binding protein and continuous vascular ring <dig>  and two genes encoding apetala2/ ethylene response factor  <cit> . chip analysis of rna samples collected 3– <dig> and 5– <dig> days after ar induction in cuttings of the poplar hybrids p. tremula x p. tremuloides  and p. tremula x p. alba , revealed that aintegumenta like <dig>  a transcription factor of the ap <dig> family, is also involved in ar formation  <cit> . using activation tagging in the populus clone 717-1b <dig>  another gene from the ap2/erf family, ptaerf <dig>  was found to promote ar formation  <cit> . recently, wuschel -related homeobox  protein family members were shown to promote ar formation in transgenic hybrid poplar  <cit> .

in pinus contorta, gene-expression profiles were determined at several time points from day  <dig> till 33 days after root induction. genes involved in cell division cell-wall weakening, and those related to water stress were upregulated during the initial stages. during later stages, genes involved in cell replication and stress were downregulated, suggesting maturation and functioning of the new roots. during the phase of root-meristem formation, the expression levels of genes involved in auxin transport and auxin-responsive transcription increased  <cit> . gene-expression analysis performed in juvenile rooting-competent pine  and chestnut  cuttings revealed the induction of scarecrow-like  genes 24 h after auxin application  <cit> , and the specific expression of csscl <dig> in the cambium and adjacent cells  <cit> . in p. radiata, a  shr-like gene was expressed in the cambial region of rooting-competent cells of hypocotyl cuttings within the first 24 h after the initiation of rooting and before the activation of cell division  <cit> .

ar formation has been studied in eucalyptus species , and analysis of the transcriptomes of juvenile and mature e. grandis cuttings prior to root induction revealed numerous differences in gene expression patterns  <cit> . one of the transcripts that was upregulated in juvenile rooting-competent cuttings was egnia , which is known to regulate nitric oxide  production, which in turn promoted ar formation  <cit> . in addition, by profiling micro rnas in e. grandis we have found that there was no mutual correlation between the expression of mir <dig> or mir <dig> and rooting potential or loss of rooting potential respectively  <cit> . in the present study we determined the kinetics of ar formation and performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional profiles in order to compare auxin responsiveness in juvenile and mature cutting of e. grandis during 12 days of ar induction.

RESULTS
the kinetics of root primordia formation in e. grandiscuttings
the present study was undertaken to elucidate the transcriptional differences between juvenile and mature cuttings following excision, exogenous application of auxin and during incubation of cuttings in rooting tables until ar are formed. to determine the kinetics of root-primordia formation, cuttings were processed for histological analysis immediately after excision and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 days after induction with auxin . auxin-treated juvenile cuttings exhibited cell division near the cambium cells, located between the phloem and xylem layers, 1– <dig> days after induction . at 3– <dig> days, dome-like primordia started to appear , and continued to develop during 6– <dig> days . at 9– <dig> days, elongated and well-developed ar primordia were observed , and at the end of this period, roots started to emerge. in contrast, in mature cuttings, although meristematic cells were detectable adjacent to the cambium  on the day of excision, and small clusters of them were detected after  <dig> to 6 days , almost no differentiated primordia were detected after  <dig> to 12 days . these observations are in agreement with previous reports which showed cell division but no root differentiation in auxin treated mature tissues of various tree species .figure  <dig>

transcriptome analysis during ar formation
to shed light on the transcriptional differences between juvenile and mature cuttings, we designed an experiment in which these cuttings were either treated or not treated with auxin and incubated on rooting tables. this enabled distinguishing between transcripts affected by auxin and those affected solely by the wounding and incubation. it should be noted that after 12 days, root primordia appeared only in auxin treated juvenile cuttings, but not in untreated ones or in treated or untreated mature cuttings. rna was extracted from three biological replications on the day of excision  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 12 days after induction  and was subjected to comprehensive dna-microarray analysis. clustering the expression profiles showed that the time after excision was the major contributor to the differences in expression . thus, most transcripts of juvenile and mature cuttings, which were incubated on the rooting table for the same period of time clustered together regardless of auxin treatment. this suggests that the expression of root specific transcripts in the auxin treated juvenile cuttings after 12 days is not high enough to distinguish them from the non rooting cuttings when determined by clustering analysis. the distribution of upregulated and downregulated transcripts  over time after excision revealed the following trends . auxin treatment began to have a detectable effect only after 3 days, which remained relatively low for  <dig> and 9 days and disappeared after 12 days. age  had a stronger effect, as reflected by the large number of transcripts that were down- or upregulated in juvenile cuttings compared to mature ones. on day  <dig>  the number of differentially expressed transcripts between juvenile and mature cuttings and between auxin-treated and -untreated was the largest. in addition, there was a clear increase in the effect of the interaction between auxin treatment and age on day  <dig> . this is an indication that a critical transcription difference between juvenile and mature e. grandis tissues occur at this time window during ar induction. out of the  <dig>  probes printed on the chip, a total of  <dig>  transcripts showed significant changes  in expression between juvenile and mature cuttings . these transcripts included a group of  <dig> transcription factors , among them putative family members of myb-, wrky- and nac-domain-containing proteins, scl, and the auxin-related transcription factors, iaa and aux. in addition,  <dig> protein kinases , among them transcripts encoding putative leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane protein kinases, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, shikimate kinase family protein, casein kinase-like, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase family protein, and somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase 1; a smaller group of redox enzymes, among them oxidases, peroxidases, and reductase; cell wall enzymes, among them cellulose synthase subunits, pectinesterases, polygalacturonase, expansin-like, and arabinogalactans; auxin- and gibberellin-related transcripts, among them pin3- and pin4-related proteins, arf6- and arf8-related proteins, auxin-responsive proteins, gibberellin-responsive proteins, and transcripts involved in gibberellin metabolism, ga20ox, and ga2ox; microtubule -associated proteins, among them several kinesins and map70; actin- and membrane-trafficking-related proteins, among them exocyst complex subunits, clathrin heavy chain, rab proteins, myosins and other actin-binding proteins . the data suggest that multiple transcripts related to different regulatory processes differ in their expression between juvenile and mature cuttings during ar induction, including those that are involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, remodeling of the cell wall and the cytoskeleton, and changes in membrane trafficking.figure  <dig>

although the contribution of auxin to the total differential expression was low , some transcripts from each functional group showed a differential auxin responsiveness between juvenile and mature cuttings. the expression of some of these transcripts was validated by the nanostring method  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the expression of e. grandis homologs of clathrin heavy chain, kinesin-like protein, a kinase like, peroxidase  <dig>  nia , a transcription factor containing a nac domain, pin <dig>  iaa <dig>  and an fh <dig> containing protein was higher at a certain time point, in auxin treated juvenile cuttings compared to mature ones.figure  <dig> 
validation of expression of several transcripts by the nanostring method confirms differential response of some transcripts to auxin in juvenile and mature cuttings. the same rna samples which were used for the chip analysis were used for the validation. probes were designed for some selected transcripts and a nanostring detection was performed. asteriks show statistical significant difference determined by scheffe analysis as follows: *1: ja vs jc p <  <dig> , *2: ja vs jc p <  <dig> , ja vs mc and ma p <  <dig> , *3: ja vs ma p <  <dig> , ja vs mc p <  <dig> , *4: ja vs mc and ma p <  <dig> , *5: ja vs mc and ma p <  <dig> , *6: ja vs jc and ma p <  <dig> , ja vs mc p <  <dig> , *7: ja vs mc and ma p <  <dig> , ja vs jc p <  <dig> , *8: ja vs jc and mc p <  <dig> .



the mt system is differentially regulated in juvenile and mature cuttings
one of the functional groups whose members showed expression differences between juvenile and mature cuttings was that encoding mt-associated proteins . we therefore hypothesized that unlike the clusters shown in figure  <dig>  clustering expression profiles based on map expression might lead to segregation between juvenile and mature samples. in addition, mts play essential regulatory roles in cell division  <cit>  and cell elongation , and a recently presented evidence suggests that they have additional functions in programs related to organogenesis  <cit> . therefore, we searched a unified est database  <cit> , and the recently released genome sequence  <cit>  for transcripts related to mts. the list  includes: homologs of  <dig> tubulin β,  <dig> tubulin α,  <dig> map <dig>   <dig> map <dig>   <dig> clasp, kinesin 13a, armadillo-repeat-containing kinesins ark <dig> and ark <dig>  kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein , krp125c, pak kinesin-like, 2 eb <dig>  gcp3/spc <dig>  gcp4/ <dig>  γ tubulin, mor <dig>  outer dynein-like light chain, katanin p <dig>  katanin p <dig>  tor <dig>  spr <dig>  ton <dig>  aurora1/ <dig>  and csi <dig>  although this might not be the full list of mt-associated proteins in the eucalyptus genome, their expression profiles during root induction in juvenile and mature cuttings should indicate whether there are major differences in mt remodeling between these two types of cuttings. probes were designed  and expression levels were determined by the nanostring method in rna samples similar to those used for the microarray analysis . the probes designed for the following homologs: fra <dig>  dynein-like light chain, spr <dig>  tubilin α <dig> and α <dig>  tubulin β <dig> and β <dig>  and for one of the clasp predicted transcripts, gave signals that were very close to the background signal, and therefore these transcripts might be expressed at very low levels or represent pseudo genes. the e. grandis homologs of aurora1/ <dig>  tubulin β <dig>  map65- <dig>  and eb1c/a, clustered together  and their expression was significantly higher in the juvenile samples compared to the mature samples on days  <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, in contrast to the cluster shown in figure  <dig>  which was based on the expression of more than  <dig>  transcripts, here the profile of juvenile cuttings,  <dig> and 9 days after excision, with or without auxin treatment, clustered in close proximity. these results indicate that differential remodeling of mt occurs in juvenile cuttings compared to mature cuttings and might be relevant to the shift from cell division to cell differentiation during formation of ar primordia. of note, mt remodeling might as well be the result and not the cause of cell differentiation.figure  <dig>

subtle perturbations of mts improve rooting of mature cuttings
as mentioned above, during rooting of woody plants mature cuttings, callus is often formed instead of roots. this phenomenon occurs because cell division is activated whereas cell differentiation is inhibited. we hypothesized that if mts play a role in differentiation, and their dynamics in mature cuttings does not favor differentiation, then subtle perturbations might make a difference. juvenile and mature cuttings were treated with auxin and increasing concentrations of the mt-disrupting drug trifluralin . while juvenile cuttings were not affected by trifluralin, rooting rate of mature cuttings gradually increased from  <dig> to  <dig> percent, concomitant with the increase in trifluralin concentration.figure  <dig>

discussion
the loss of rooting ability in mature woody plants has mystified plant scientists and growers for years. e. grandis exemplifies this problem. pruning of 6- to 7-month-old e. grandis seedlings at either 10–15 cm or 150–200 cm above the ground induces shoot sprouting near the cut trunk. cuttings taken from low-pruned seedlings root easily, whereas cuttings taken from high-pruned seedlings barely root at all . this phenomenon demonstrates the gradual decrease of rooting ability in physiological mature tissues. however, the specific maturity traits that inhibit rooting are unknown. completion of sequencing of the e. grandis genome  <cit>  has made it a suitable experimental system for addressing these questions. in the present study we analyzed the gradual changes in expression profiles of the expression of  <dig>  transcripts during the root-induction process in juvenile and mature cuttings in the presence or absence of auxin. this enabled us to distinguish between expression changes mediated by the developmental stage of the cuttings, and those mediated by the auxin treatment. selection of the time intervals at which rna was extracted during root induction was based on the kinetics of root primordia formation. in juvenile cuttings, clusters of dividing cells were already detectable after 1– <dig> days, root primodia were formed after 6– <dig> days, and root emergence was detectable after 12 days in auxin-treated juvenile cuttings. in contrast, in mature cuttings, although some cell divisions were observed, no primordia were formed during the time period of the experiment. this is in agreement with observations made in other tree species , and suggests that the transition from cell division to cell differentiation is somehow hampered in mature cuttings.

it was found here that the most significant expression differences were driven by the time after excision, less by the developmental phase of the cuttings, and the least by auxin treatment. this is in agreement with previous observations in pine, in which no differences in auxin uptake, metabolism and transport were found between easy-to-root hypocotyls and difficult-to-root epicotyls  <cit> . it should be emphasized that rooting was not synchronized in all cuttings, and that the frequency of root primordia in the samples taken for rna preparation was low. therefore, the results may be masked by a high background of irrelevant transcripts expressed by stem tissues surrounding the primordia. this is an intrinsic problem of the biological system, and we cannot rule out the possibility that important transcripts went undected. despite this problem some statistically significant expression differences were revealed by the system. these offer some novel research directions for ar-formation research. for example, the finding that  <dig> % of the transcripts that were differentially expressed between juvenile and mature cuttings are protein kinases, suggests that major differences are mediated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions, and protein stability. indeed, receptor-like kinases play an important role in root development  <cit> .

the finding of a transient increase in nia after 1 day of auxin treatment only in juvenile cuttings is in agreement with our previous data, which showed that e. grandis nia is involved in a transient increase in no concentration after excision  <cit> . we also showed that higher levels of no accumulates in juvenile cuttings than in mature ones after pruning  <cit> , which is likely due to the observed specific auxin-mediated nia upregulation in these cuttings. the difference in expression of clathrin and the formin-like fh <dig> domain containing transcript between juvenile and mature cuttings, suggest differences in remodeling of the actin and membrane trafficking systems during ar induction. this is in agreement with previous observations which showed differential expression of actin in response to iba between pine hypocotyls and epicotyls  <cit> , of actin <dig> between juvenile and mature cuttings of eucalyptus grandis
 <cit> , and a change in a fimbrin-like <dig>  in transgenic poplar with inhibited ar formation potential <cit> . the relevance of the actin system to ar formation was also suggested when paradoxically, a rgd containing peptide improved rooting of mature arabidopsis cuttings  <cit> .

the changes in expression of mt-related transcripts suggest that they are also involved in ar organogenesis. the notion of mt involvement in plant organogenesis has recently been addressed and a cross talk between mt and auxin signaling has been found  <cit> . we presume that mts participate in the regulation of four factors that are important for ar formation:  the number of dividing cells, which should reach a threshold level for coordinated differentiation to occur;  the orientation and symmetry of cell division;  the cross talk and coordination between dividing cells which allows organogenesis; and  polar cell elongation. the largest difference in gene expression after 6 days might reflect a peak in the extent of cell division in juvenile cuttings at this time. this assumption is based on three different observations:  the histological analysis that shows much more dividing cells in juvenile cuttings than in mature ones.  the specific increase in aurora, and map65- <dig> in juvenile cuttings compared to mature ones. both proteins participate in the regulation of the mt apparatus during cell division  <cit> ;  toward day  <dig> the differences in expression profiles between juvenile and mature cuttings decline despite root primordia formation, suggesting that root-specific genes do not underlie the major expression differences detected in this system. it might be concluded that the shift to differentiation depends among other things on a critical mass of dividing cells, below of which differentiation is hampered. in addition, asymmetric cell division which is also regulated by mts  <cit>  is critical for differentiation  <cit> . based on our finding we propose that differential permissive conditions which exist in the context of juvenile tissues in contrast to mature tissues and are influenced by mt remodeling allow the shift from cell division to cell differentiation after the initial onset of cell division.

the increase in rooting rate after subtle perturbation of the mts with trifluralin might result from changes in mt dynamics, organization, or mass which affect cell division  <cit> , cell-wall properties  <cit> , coherent auxin transport  <cit> , or other unknown parameters. of note, the half life of trifluralin was documented to be 25– <dig> days under various agronomic conditions  <cit>  which suggests that its effect may last throughout ar induction.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data indicate that the difference in expression profiles between juvenile and mature e. grandis cuttings is mostly affected by time after excision, to a lesser extent by the developmental stage of the cuttings, and least by auxin treatment. among the functional groups of genes that were differentially expressed during ar induction in these cuttings, was that of the maps. therefore, juvenile-specific, fine-tuned mt remodeling seems to be involved in ar formation. induction of juvenile specific expression that is observed 6– <dig> days after excision and auxin application is thought to be a second or a third wave of transcription activation that is induced by early genes that are induced shortly after the treatment. such immediate induction was previously described for short-root like gene from pinus radiata
 <cit>  and scarecrow-like genes from pinus radiata and european chestnut castanea sativa mill in cambium cells of competent cuttings  <cit> . we propose that both early and late changes in gene expression are giving the tissue its rooting competence. nevertheless, some expression patterns observed several days after root induction might also be the result of root differentiation and not the cause for it.
