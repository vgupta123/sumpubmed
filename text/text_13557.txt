BACKGROUND
gene targeting is a powerful method for the production of genetically modified cell lines or animals, allowing for the various functions of genes to be studied. in mice, several thousand genes have been disrupted using homologous recombination. however, when these methods have been applied to human somatic cells they have generally been ineffective because of very low targeting efficiencies
 <cit> . although rna interference can reduce the expression of a gene, interpretation of such experiments can be unreliable because of non-specific targeting or incomplete inactivation of genes. therefore, we believe it is essential to improve the efficiency of knockout  approaches in human somatic cells.

recombinant adeno-associated viruses , such as human parvovirus, possess a single-stranded dna genome of around  <dig>  kb. hirata
 <cit>  and porteus
 <cit>  found that raavs can be used to target genes in human cell lines. use of these raavs resulted in higher targeting frequencies than those obtained with conventional plasmid vectors
 <cit> . the wild-type human parvovirus genome contains two open reading frames , designated rep and cap, flanked by two inverted terminal repeats. the rep orf encodes proteins involved in viral replication, and the cap orf encodes proteins necessary for viral packaging. in raav-mediated ko vectors these orfs are deleted and replaced with a neomycin resistant gene flanked by two homology arms. the stages involved in carrying out raav-mediated gene ko include:  design and construction of the aav ko vector;  collecting an infectious raav stock;  infecting the appropriate cell line;  screening for homologous recombinants; and  iteratively targeting the multiple alleles. it takes at least three months just to target the first allele
 <cit> .

apart from the low efficiency of homologous recombination, a rate-limiting step in gene targeting of human somatic cell lines is assembly of the gene targeting construct. traditionally, this requires an amplification step to obtain two large homologous fragments of genomic dna, followed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and then numerous cloning steps. it is an extremely time-consuming process and limited by the available unique restriction enzyme sites in the vector and in the two amplified homologous fragments. phage-based escherichia coli homologous recombination systems
 <cit>  have been developed that now make it possible to subclone or modify dna cloned into plasmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes , or p1-derived artificial chromosomes  without the need for restriction enzymes or dna ligases. however, these recombination systems require long homology arms and usually one can only insert one fragment at the time.

traditional dna cloning suffers from several limitations, including poor ligation efficiency, along with a dependence on the availability of unique restriction sites in both the insert and vector. for this reason, many methods regarding directional subcloning have been developed
 <cit> . these methods include the use of uracil dna n-glycosylase
 <cit> , t <dig> dna polymerase
 <cit> , enzymatic assembly
 <cit>  or exonuclease iii 
 <cit>  to generate long compatible cohesive ends between the dna insert and cloning vector. it has also been found that by generating longer cohesive ends, the annealed dna complex becomes more stable and the ligation reaction can be omitted. this technique has come to be known as ligation-independent cloning , and has been demonstrated to have a high efficiency. developing more lic methods will give the researchers more chioce according to the different situations.

to increase cloning efficiency and ligation of four fragments simultaneously, we developed a one-step lic method for construction of ko vectors. using this method, it becomes easy to construct ko vectors in two days. in this paper, we have outlined our strategy for modifying ptk-loxp-neo-aav, and demonstrated successful construction of a sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vector. once we had made the vectors, we were able to obtain sirt <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line hct <dig> and hdac <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line dld <dig> 

RESULTS
construction and characterization of a paav-lic vector
assembly of gene-targeting constructs is a rate-limiting step when targeting genes in human somatic cell lines. other limitations include multi-step ligations and the availability of unique restriction sites in the insert and vector. to overcome many of these limitations we modified an aav shuttle vector into a one-step lic vector. this was achieved by introducing two fixed cassettes into the multiple-cloning site  of the shuttle vector . the two cassettes involved three elements: sticky ends complementary to the cloning site in ptk-loxp-neo-aav, allowing for insertion of the cassettes; ecorv sites in the middle of the cassette, which could be used to cut the lic vector into two fragments containing blunt ends; and 14- to 18-mer sequences that could produce long sticky ends when exoiii was used.

first, cassette a was inserted into ptk-loxp-neo-aav using ecorv and sali digestion. because the cassette end did not include the ecorv palindromic sequence, this process restored the sali site and destroyed the original ecorv site. following confirmation by sequencing, cassette b was inserted into the vector now containing cassette a. this was facilitated by digestion with nhei and spei digestion. the modifications to the vector were again confirmed by sequencing, and we designated the designed vector as paav-lic.

construction of a sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vectors
we used paav-lic to construct sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vector by one-step lic . the paav-lic vector was digested with ecorv, resulting in two fragments . these fragments were recovered from agarose gels following electrophoresis and purified using gel extraction kits. the smaller fragment was found to contain the thymidine kinase  promoter, the loxp sequence and the neomycin orf. the larger fragment was found to contain the aav backbone, necessary for plasmid replication in e. coli, and for viral packaging.

the two homologous arms for sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vector construction were obtained by polymerase chain reaction  and purified using gel extraction kits. the pcr primers used were designed to add additional 14- to 18-mer sequences overlapping with the ends of digested vector fragments. polymerases, including taq polymerase, possess the ability to add datp at the 3′ ends of pcr products, thereby inhibiting the 3′ exonuclease activity of exoiii. therefore we recommend using pfu or primestar polymerases when amplifying homologous arms, as they result in amplicons with blunt ends.

the 3′ exonuclease activity of exoiii is very high at 37°c. to generate 16-mer overhangs at a stable and low rate, it is necessary to optimize reaction temperature and time. according to our experience, to ensure stable cloning,  <dig> h at 0°c or  <dig> min at 4°c are both sufficient. using other conditions proved difficult, with both the number of colonies and the rate of positive transformants acquired highly variable. to produce complementary sticky ends, the purified homologous arms and two vector fragments were mixed and chilled at 0°c for  <dig> min, then treated with  <dig> u of exoiii at 0°c for  <dig> h. the reaction was terminated using edta or by heating to 65°c. after transformation into dh5Î± e. coli, enzymatic bacterial dna repair machinery helped to facilitate ligation endogenously.

colony pcr and sequencing was used to verify the positive transformants. screening by pcr showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> colonies analyzed were positive transformants . sequencing results further confirmed the pcr results . the resulting ko vector was designated as the aav-sirt <dig> ko vector. also we got the aav-hdac <dig> ko vector.

use of gene targeting to generate sirt1-null hct <dig> cells and hdac2-null dld <dig> cells
to confirm its ability to be used in the development of ko cell lines, the targeting aavs were packaged in 293t cells by transfecting equal amounts of the sirt <dig> ko targeting vector targeting vector, phelper and prc. then hct <dig> cells were infected with the sirt <dig> targeting viruses and selected with geneticin. after two weeks, the neomycin-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by genomic pcr. we screened  <dig> clones and obtained  <dig> positives. to remove the neomycin-resistant gene, two of the correctly targeted clones were infected with adenoviruses expressing cre-recombinase. using genomic pcr, we screened  <dig> clones, with  <dig> of them found to be positives containing an additional  <dig> bp fragment in which the loxp site was inserted. up until this point we had succeeded in obtaining heterozygous ko clones. to delete both alleles, heterozygous ko clones were infected with the same targeting virus and the neomycin resistance gene was excised. finally we obtained homozygous ko clones and the ko cell lines were confirmed by western blot . use the same protocol, hdac <dig> targeting viruses were made and dld <dig> cells were infected with the hdac <dig> targeting viruses. also we obtained hdac2-null dld <dig> cells and confirmed by western blot .

CONCLUSIONS
as outlined above, we successfully constructed the aav-sirt <dig> and aav-hdac <dig> ko vectors and obtained sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko cell lines. compared with the traditional ‘digestion-ligation’ vector construction method, our approach is not limited by the availability of restriction sites; therefore, somatic cell gene ko vectors can be easily constructed within 2– <dig> days. additionally, our method does not require the use of any single specific restriction enzyme, and has great potential for the high-throughput construction of gene ko vectors. however, it also has some limitations, such as the potential errors can be produced during amplification by pcr and it need high efficiency competent cells for the transformation.
