BACKGROUND
the reconstruction of human history is a multidisciplinary objective. alternative models proposed to explain the origin and dispersion of modern humans on the basis of paleoanthropological data  <cit>  have received uneven support from other disciplines. from a genetic perspective, uniparental non-recombining markers have depicted the most complete and coherent picture of the origin of modern humans, clearly favoring the recent out-of-africa hypothesis. the greatest diversity and the deepest phylogenetic branches for both y-chromosome  <cit>  and mtdna  <cit>  have been found in africa. these african lineages have coalescence ages  <cit>  compatible with a recent african origin of modern humans as proposed by fossil  <cit>  and archaeological studies  <cit> . furthermore, only more derived lineages have been found out of africa supporting the hypothesis that, in their worldwide dispersion, modern humans replaced archaic humans inside and outside africa. it seems that radiation in africa of y-chromosome m <dig> derived lineages  <cit>  and l <dig> mtdna lineages  <cit>  preceded the out-of-africa expansion. focusing on mtdna, all non-african lineages belong to two founder clusters, named m and n, which share a common root with their l <dig> african counterpart. two possible out-of-africa routes have been proposed: a southern coastal route bordering the read sea and an eurasian continental route through the levant. based on mitochondrial phylogeography it was proposed that m lineages expanded with the coastal route to southern asia and oceania and n lineages by the continental route to eurasia  <cit> . however, the posterior detection of primitive n lineages in southern areas as india  <cit>  and australia  <cit>  weakened that hypothesis  <cit> . as, in addition, the founder ages of m and n are very similar, the alternative hypothesis, that m and n founders derived from a single african migration, was favored by several authors  <cit> . another related disjunctive yet not settled is whether m and n  arose inside or outside africa  <cit> . the detection of a basal branch of haplogroup m in africa  gave support to the idea that haplogroup m originated in eastern africa and was carried towards asia with the out-of-africa expansion  <cit> . the alternative hypothesis, that haplogroup m <dig> could trace a posterior backflow to africa from asia, considered by several authors  <cit>  has not yet gained experimental support because, until now, no ancestral m <dig> lineages have been found outside africa  <cit> .

to shed light on this haplogroup we have constructed a phylogeny of the m <dig> clade based on the analysis of  <dig> complete or nearly complete mitochondrial sequences representing the main branches of m <dig> and realized a phylogeographic study using  <dig> partial m <dig> sequences to determine the most probable age and origin of this clade and the temporal and spatial frame of its secondary expansions in africa and eurasia.

RESULTS
although we have only completely sequenced a limited number of m <dig> lineages, the combination of hvsi haplotypes and rflp status carried out for the rest of our m <dig> samples allow us to be confident that we have not missed any new basic m <dig> lineage.

as an outgroup of the m <dig> genomic phylogenetic tree  we used a published indian m <dig> complete sequence  <cit> . when this m <dig> lineage is compared to the rare m sequence previously detected in two palestinians  <cit> , it is evident that it belongs to the indian super-clade m4' <dig>  as it shares the basal mutation  <dig>  more specifically it belongs to the m <dig> branch because it also has transition  <dig>  m <dig> has a broad geographic, ethnic and linguistic range in india. it has been detected in northern and southern india, in australoid and caucasoids, and in dravid and indo-european speakers  <cit> . so, instead of an autochthonous near east m lineage, its presence in palestine is probably due to a recent gene flow from india. after careful re-reading and partial re-sequencing of two previously published m <dig> sequences  <cit> , we have detected in them the following errors: both have the 12950c transversion, and, in addition m <dig>  has the  <dig> transition and m <dig>  the  <dig> transition. taking these modifications into account, from the m basal type, haplogroup m <dig> is characterized by one transversion  and four transitions  in the coding region and by a five transitions motif  in the non-coding region . this haplogroup can be rflp diagnosed by a mnli site loss at position  <dig>  two main branches, m1c and m1abde, respectively defined by transitions  <dig> and  <dig>  sprout from the root. based on partial sequences m1c was defined by transition  <dig>  <cit> . however, not all m1c lineages present this mutation that, in addition, recurrently appears in a m1b <dig> lineage. it seems that for population studies m1c could be better diagnosed by a ddei site loss using a modified reverse primer . it is surprising that none of the three m1c complete sequences have an eastern africa ancestry: one  has a levantine origin and the other two belong to west sub-saharan africa  and west mediterranean  areas. the latter two sequences conform a new m1c <dig> subclade defined by transitions  <dig> and  <dig> that can be rflp diagnosed at  <dig> position . in relation to the m1abde cluster, it is also surprising that one lineage that directly branched out from the root  has a northwestern, not eastern, berber ancestry. all the rest of lineages shared the  <dig> transition forming the m1abd cluster. again, an isolate offshoot of basque ancestry  sprouts from its root. subclade m1b was characterized by an rflp site gain  and loss of - <dig> haeiii  <cit> . later an m1b subclade defined by the non-coding motif 16260– <dig> and restricted to east africans was identified  <cit> . consistently, none of our m1b sequences from western areas has that motif. the last cluster, m1a, was first distinguished by rflp + <dig> rsai  <cit>  and, after that, further characterized by transition  <dig>  <cit> . in addition it also has transition  <dig> at its root . m1a is the most prominent clade in eastern africa. however, its expansion occurred later than the other m <dig> branches . an m1a subclade, m1a <dig>  defined by transition  <dig>  that can be rflp diagnosed , testifies a posterior spread of m1a to western asia.

b number outside and inside the parenthesis were used to estimate the m <dig> and m1a frequency, respectively.

the presence in the mediterranean basin and in west sub-saharan africa of m1a and m1c lineages can be taken as proof that these areas received influences both from the west and east north african centers of m <dig> radiation. quantitative confirmation of the above described patterns are provided by amova and pairwise distances based on fst analyses using the groups and populations described in material and methods and taking into account haplotypic molecular differences. as usual the bulk of the variation, 90%, is within populations, 6% is due to differences among groups and 4% to differences among populations within groups. pairwise differences between populations  offer a more detailed view. there is homogeneity between populations within eastern africa, small differences  within western africa and strong heterogeneity between these main areas . on the contrary, iberian peninsula has significant differences with the rest of europe. in turn, west asia conforms an homogenous continuum with east africa and europe excepting iberian peninsula and the latter is not significantly different of western africa. all these results can be explained as due to the differential radiation of m1a from east africa and m1c from northwest africa, the iberian peninsula being mostly influenced by northwest africa and the rest of europe and western asia by east africa.

m <dig> haplotypes in jews
several m <dig> haplotypes have been detected in jewish communities albeit in low frequencies  <cit> . however, when compared with non-jew populations they show significantly higher frequencies for the whole m <dig> haplogroup  and for m1a in particular . the only striking exception is that of the moroccan jews for which no m <dig> lineages have been detected at all  <cit> . interestingly, all m <dig> lineages found in jews, except two, belong to the eastern clade m1a . therefore, as for the bulk of the m <dig> near east haplotypes, the most probable origin of these jewish m <dig> lineages is the result of an eastern african expansion around  <dig> years ago. another peculiarity of m <dig> in jewish communities is its reduced haplotypic diversity  which has been already detected for other mtdna lineages  <cit> . in addition, there is a strong m <dig> geographic differentiation among jewish communities. for example, all european ashkenazi jews have only one m1a lineage characterized by a transition in the  <dig> position that has not been detected in other jew or non-jew populations. similarly, all west asian jews shared an identical m1a motif characterized by a transition in the  <dig> position that has been detected only once in ethiopia. these results are congruent with the proposition that, in the majority of the cases, jewish migrations implied strong maternal founder effects  <cit> . nevertheless, as m1a jewish lineages are unique and different in different groups, we think that its source near east population should not suffer strong genetic bottlenecks. finally, it is worth mentioning that m <dig> frequencies of jewish groups and their host populations are significantly correlated  which suggests that some genetic interchange must have happened between them as already proposed by others authors  <cit> .

radiation ages and evolution of lineages
radiation ages for m <dig> and its subhaplogroups have been estimated on the basis of complete coding and hvsi sequences using different mutation rate estimations . the ages obtained for m <dig> and m1a from hvsi data are more coherent with those calculated for the coding region using the ingman et al.  <cit>  mutation rate than that proposed by mishmar et al.  <cit> . our coalescence age estimations for the whole m <dig> clade  are younger than those previously published  <cit> ; however, the approximate expansion ages for the eastern africa m1a subclade  are in the same range. although standard errors overlap, it seems that the northwestern africa expansion represented by m1c subclade , preceded the m1a eastern africa expansion  m1b being the youngest branch . it must be stated that coalescence ages are only rough estimations biased by mutation rate estimations, small sample size, demographic history and, possibly, selection. there are recent examples of clock-like evolution violations in several mtdna lineages that have been explained by selective or demographic effects  <cit> . here, subclade m1a <dig>  represents a new example of constant mutation rate violation. the mean number of substitutions accumulated in m1a <dig> lineages  is significantly higher  than that in the rest of m <dig> lineages . this result is not compatible with a uniform rate of evolution. the small standard errors show that there is high lineage homogeneity within groups, which weakens the possibility that stochastic processes have played a main role. different patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes among different lineages have been taken as hints of a role for selection in other studies  <cit> . in our case differences between synonymous vs. nonsynonymous changes within groups does not reach statistical signification . however, the mean number of coding region substitutions accumulated in m1a <dig> lineages  is significantly higher  than in the rest of m <dig> . conversely, the mean number of regulatory region substitutions accumulated in m1a <dig> lineages  is smaller than in the rest  although not reaching statistical significance . if the mutation rate was constant along the whole mtdna molecule, for each mutation in the regulatory region roughly fourteen mutations should accumulate in the coding region. however, selection pressure is higher in the coding than in the regulatory region so that the substitution rate is ten times faster in the latter. the mean coding/regulatory ratio is  <dig>  for m1a <dig> lineages and only  <dig>  for the rest of m <dig>  we interpret these results as due to different ages of expansion between clades. m1a <dig> would be the youngest clade with a more recent expansion than the others so that purifying selection has not had enough time to eliminate mutations with small deleterious effects in the coding region. we think that differences in the rate of evolution among subgroups of the north african u <dig> haplogroup  <cit>  could be better explained by the same pattern assuming that the u6a subclade, with the highest coding/regulatory ratio, had a more recent radiation than the u6b subclade. in spite of its anomalous behavior, m1a <dig> has only a minor effect on the estimation of the whole m <dig> coalescence age although its omission significantly diminishes that of the m1a subgroup .

discussion
phylogeographic parallelism between m <dig> and u <dig> haplogroups
there are striking similarities between the geographical dispersals and radiation ages observed here for m <dig> lineages and those previously published for the north african u <dig> haplogroup  <cit> . it was proposed that u6a first spread was in northwest africa around  <dig>  ya. coalescence ages for m <dig> also fit into this period and the oldest clade m1c has an evident northwestern africa distribution; however it had to have a wide geographic range as some m1c lineages are today still present in jordanians . it is curious that this prehistoric near eastern colonization was also pointed out by the uniqueness of the u6a haplotypes detected in that area. a posterior east to west african expansion around  <dig>  ya was indicated by the u6a <dig> relative diversity and distribution. again, age, relative east to west diversities and geographic range accurately correspond with the m1a <dig> expansion detected here. more recent local spread of lineages u6b and u6c also parallel the m1b and m1c <dig> distributions. furthermore, these similarities also hold outside africa. u <dig> lineages in the iberian peninsula have been considered traces of northward expansions from africa. based on the uneven distribution of u6a and u6b lineages in iberia, with the former predominating in southern and the latter in northern areas, it was proposed that u6b in iberia represents a signal of a prehistoric north african immigration whereas the presence of u6a could be better attributed to the long lasting historic arab/berber occupation  <cit> . again, this pattern is accurately repeated by the m1c and m1a distribution in the iberian peninsula, the northwest african m <dig> being more abundant in northern areas  and the east african m1a in southern areas  although, due to the small sample size, difference does not reach a significant level . additional support to the hypothesis of a prehistoric introduction are the recently detected presence of a northwest african m1c lineage in a basque cemetery dated to the 6th–7th centuries ad, prior to the moorish occupation  <cit> , and the ancestral phylogenetic position of another basque m1d sequence  that does not match any african sequence. finally, two autochthonous u <dig> lineages  traced the origin of the canary islands prehispanic aborigines to northwest africa  <cit> . although exclusive m <dig> lineages have not been detected in the canary islands, it is worth mentioning that those sampled belong to the northwest african area  <cit> . outside africa and the iberian peninsula, as with u <dig>  m <dig> has been mainly detected in other mediterranean areas with main incidences in islands such as sicily. it is customary to attribute these incidences to the above mentioned arab/berber historic occupations. however, taking into account the major jewish assignation for all the m1a haplotypes detected in europe, the possibility of a jewish maternal ascendance for at least some of these lineages should not be rejected.

note that the two m <dig> lineages sampled in the balearic isles were of jewish adscription  <cit> . also, there were well documented jewish settlements in sicily since early roman times  <cit>  and, coincidentally, half of the m <dig> lineages sampled in that island  <cit>  belong to the m1a cluster. finally, the atlantic archipelagos of canaries and madeira, where the rigor of the spanish inquisition was stronger, only have m1c representatives. in contrast, in the azores islands, that were used as a refuge by sephardim jews expelled from the iberian peninsula, half of the m <dig> sequences detected are of m1a assignation  <cit> . these possible jewish contributions might be also extended to the u <dig> lineages of eastern origin because all u <dig> haplotypes detected in ashkenazim and other jewish groups, excepting one that is a basal u6a , belong to the eastern africa clade u6a <dig>  <cit> . an additional proof of the striking parallelism between m <dig> and u <dig> lineages is the fact that, as for m <dig>  no u <dig> representatives were sampled in moroccan jews in spite of the high frequency of this clade in the moroccan and berber host populations  <cit> .

most probable origin of m <dig> ancestors
mitochondrial m lineages in ethiopia were first detected by rflp analyses  <cit> . to explain its presence in that area the authors suggested two possibilities: 1) the marker was acquired by ethiopians through interchanges with asians or 2) it was present in the ancient ethiopian population and was carried to asia by groups who migrated out of africa. later, the second hypothesis was favored and a single origin of haplogroup m in africa was suggested, dating the split between asian and african m branches older than  <dig>  ya  <cit> . although not completely discarding this last scenario other authors considered that the disjunctive was unsettled. the vast diversity of haplogroup m in asia compared to africa pointed to the possibility that m <dig> is a branch that traces a backflow from asia to africa  <cit> . due to the scarcity of m lineages in the near east and its richness in india, this region was proposed as the most probable origin of the m <dig> ancestor  <cit> . however, recent studies based on indian mtdna sequences  <cit>  have not found any positive evidence that m <dig> originated in india. nevertheless, the inclusion of m <dig> complete mtdna lineages in the construction of the macrohaplogroup m phylogeny clearly established that the antiquity of indian lineages, as m <dig>  as compared to ethiopian m <dig> lineages support an asian origin of macrohaplogroup m  <cit> . furthermore, the comparison within africa of eastern and western m <dig> sequences left the origin of m <dig> in africa uncertain  <cit> . on the light of our and other authors results, it seems clear that by their respective coalescence ages and diversities, m <dig> is younger than other asiatic m lineages. although it is out of doubt that the l <dig> ancestor of m had an african origin, macrohaplogroup m radiated outside africa and m <dig> should be considered an evolved branch that signals its return to this continent. even more, as the coalescence ages of the northwestern m1c clade is older than the eastern m1a clade, we think that the most ancient dispersals of m <dig> occurred in northwestern africa, reaching also the iberian peninsula, instead of ethiopia. the detection of an ancestral m1c sequence in jordanians could be explained by two alternative hypotheses: 1) that the near east was the most probable origin of the primitive m <dig> dispersals, west into africa and east to central asia. this supposition would explain the presence of basic m <dig> lineages, instead of the most common m1a derivates, as far as the tibet. the actual scarcity of these types in eastern areas could be explained by posterior migrations that erased these primitive lineages. the absence of these ancestral m1c lineages in ethiopia would point to the sinai peninsula as the most probable gate of entrance of this backflow to africa. 2) that m <dig> is an autochthonous north african clade that had its earliest spread in northwestern areas marginally reaching the near east and beyond. this would explain the shortage of basic m <dig> lineages in the near east but would leave the asiatic origin of the m <dig> ancestor undetermined. in any case, both alternatives envisaged m in africa as an offshoot of the asiatic m trunk. the striking phylogeographic parallelism between u <dig> and m <dig> haplogroups adds additional support to these hypotheses. it is possible to correlate the dispersion ages of the different m <dig> clades with their contemporary climatic, archaeological, paleoanthropological and linguistic information. for instance, the first m <dig> backflow to africa, dated around  <dig>  ya, is coincidental with a harsh glacial period which suggests that this human retreat to africa could be forced by climatic conditions. the low sea level in the gibraltar strait at that time could also facilitate the iberian peninsula colonization. the northwestern african m1c and the probable north central m1b expansions are coincidental with the iberomaurusian and capsian industries. the anomalous evolution of m1a <dig> lineages left the coalescence ages of the eastern africa m1a expansion uncertain, but as suggested for the sister u6a <dig> radiation; these movements could be correlated in time with an african origin and expansion of afroasiatic languages  <cit> . finally, from a maternal genetic perspective it seems that neolithic occupation of the sahara had both eastern and western influences.  most probably other mtdna lineages participated in this human back flow to africa. it has been suggested that the north african x <dig> branch of the euroasiatic haplogroup x could be one of them  <cit> . 

whilst this paper was under review, a new paper also dealing with u <dig> and m <dig> haplogroups was published  <cit> . haplogroup topologies and phylogeographic conclusions proposed by olivieri et al.  <cit>  are highly coincidental with those proposed by us in our previous paper on u <dig>  <cit>  and in the present paper, dealing with m <dig>  regrettably, there are differences in nomenclature for m <dig>  whereas our m <dig> phylogeny adhered to that proposed previously by other authors  <cit> , olivieri et al.  <cit>  chose to apply their own. nevertheless, the diagnostic positions for the different m <dig> subhaplogroups allowed us to establish subhaplogroup homologies between the two works. clearly their m1b subgroup  corresponds to our m1c subgroup; their m1a <dig> subgroup  corresponds to our m1b subgroup. finally, their m1a <dig> subgroup  corresponds to our m1a subgroup. in addition to the reinforcing overlap of ideas, it is worthwhile mentioning the high coincidence for the coalescence ages of m <dig> and the majority of its subhaplogroups, when the same substitution rate  <cit>  is used. olivieri et al.  <cit>  calculated a coalescence time estimate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ky for the entire haplogroup m <dig> that matches our estimate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ky. our coalescence time for m1c  also overlaps with olivieri et al.  <cit>  haplogroup m1b . likewise, the coalescence age calculated for our m1a subhaplogroup  is in the range of the olivieri et al.  <cit>  estimation for their m1a <dig> subhaplogroup . the only discrepancy is about the coalescence time estimate between our m1b subhaplogroup  that is younger than that calculated by olivieri et al.  <cit>  for their homologous m1a <dig> . as our calculations are based only on three lineages and that of oliveri et al  <cit>  on six, we think that their coalescence time estimation should be more accurate that ours. in fact, when time estimation is based on the eight different lineages  a coalescence age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ky is obtained. although with overlapping errors, these results, together with the relative ancestral positions of each subgroup in the phylogenetic tree , would suggest that the northwestern m1c clade radiation was older than those for the ubiquitous m1b and the eastern m1a clades, as also proposed by olivieri et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence that m <dig>  or its ancestor, had an asiatic origin. the earliest m <dig> expansion into africa occurred in northwestern instead of northeastern areas; this early spread reached the iberian peninsula even affecting the basques. the majority of the m1a lineages found outside and inside africa had a more recent eastern africa origin. both western and eastern m <dig> lineages participated in the neolithic colonization of the sahara. the striking parallelism between subclade ages and geographic distribution of m <dig> and its north african u <dig> counterpart strongly reinforces this scenario. finally, a relevant fraction of m1a lineages present today in the european continent and nearby islands possibly had a jewish instead of the commonly proposed arab/berber maternal ascendance.
