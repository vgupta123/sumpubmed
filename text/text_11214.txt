BACKGROUND
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  is a chronic, progressive, and usually fatal disease. the features of the disease are characterized by repeated injury and activation of alveolar epithelial cells, formation of myofibroblasts and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma  <cit> . the estimated prevalence of ipf in the united states is  <dig> to  <dig>  per  <dig>  people  <cit> . however, the etiology and molecular mechanisms of ipf initiation and progression are largely unclear.

chronic lung inflammation had been considered preceding pulmonary fibrosis and played a major role in lung fibrogenesis. however, some evidence suggested that inflammation was not an important pathogenic event of ipf. for example, in the early or late course of ipf, including diseases similar to mild or moderate alveolitis, there was a lack of long-term effective response to anti-inflammation therapy  <cit> . fibroblasts are the main source of abnormal extracellular matrix production in ipf. the tgfβ signaling is an important mediator of pulmonary fibrosis in both animals and humans. tgfβ modulates the activation of fibroblasts  <cit> . alveolar epithelial cells also play an important role in the process of pathogenesis of ipf. the activated cells secrete soluble protein factors, including tgfβ, tnfα, endothelin- <dig> to exert their effects on fibroblasts  <cit> .

micrornas  are a group of endogenous non-coding small rnas. more than  <dig> mature mirnas are found from plants to humans. mirnas are the key regulators of many biological processes, and they function by inhibition of translation and degradation of target mrnas to control protein expression in physiological and pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . mirnas are involved in almost all aspects of cell physiology, including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and diseases . based on computational analysis, the mrna targets of mirnas in most mammals are conserved due to selective pressure  <cit> .

mir-27b has been reported to play a role in breast, liver, kidney or other organs. for example, antagomir of mir-27b suppressed cell invasion in human breast cancer cell line, mda-mb- <dig>  whereas pre-mir-27b stimulated invasion in zr <dig> breast cancer cells  <cit> . mir-27b synergized with anticancer drugs in a defined subgroup of liver and kidney cancer patients  <cit> . the overexpression or inhibition of mir-27b in huh <dig> cells significantly decreased or increased the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  alpha protein level  <cit> . mir-27b targets the 3’-untranslated region  of pparγ and inhibits its mrna and protein expression in neuroblastoma cells  <cit> .

recently, mir-27b was identified as a major mirna in modulating tgfβ-induced collagen i expression using a mirna inhibitor library  <cit> . the inhibition of mir-27b increased col1a <dig> expression. however, this study used lung epithelial cancer cell line a <dig> cells rather than pulmonary fibroblasts. during the course of this work, cui et al. published a study showing that transfection of mir-27a-3p mimic into a fetal lung fibroblast cell line mrc- <dig> inhibited col1a <dig> and alpha-smooth muscle actin  and this result was confirmed in ipf fibroblasts  <cit> . the use of a mirna mimic could result in overwhelmed expression of a mirna since it by-pass the cellular regulatory system for the processing of a mirna.

in this study, we investigated a role of mir-27b in fibroblast activation using a human lung fibroblasts and a lentiviral vector expressing a primary mir-27b, which is converted into a mature mirna via the endogenous processing system after entering cells. we found that mir-27b inhibited fibroblast activation, and tgfβ receptor  <dig>  and smad <dig> are direct targets of mir-27b. our results suggest that mir-27b is an anti-fibrotic mirna in pulmonary fibroblasts.

RESULTS
mir-27b is down-regulated in the lungs and fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated mice
we determined mir-27b expression levels in the fibrotic lungs induced by bleomycin in mice by real-time pcr. the expression of mir-27b in the lung tissue of bleomycin-treated mice was decreased significantly compared to that of the control mice . to examine which types of the lung cells account for the decrease, we isolated fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells from the bleomycin-treat mice. the expression level of mir-27b in fibroblasts was much higher than alveolar epithelial type i and type ii cells . bleomycin treatment reduced mir-27b expression in the fibroblasts , suggesting that fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the reduction of mir-27b in the fibrotic lungs.fig.  <dig> mir-27b expression in the lung tissues and fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated mice. the lung tissues were collected from saline control  and bleomycin-treated mice. fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type ii cells  were isolated from the lungs. alveolar epithelial type i cells  were obtained via trans-differentiation by culturing aec ii for 5 days in vitro. the expression of mir-27b was determined by real-time pcr and normalized to rnu <dig> . data shown are means ± s.e. **p <  <dig> . n =  <dig> for lung tissues; n =  <dig> for fibroblasts; and n =  <dig> for aec i and aec ii. student t-test

mir-27b attenuates the contractile activity in pulmonary fibroblasts
the contraction process is known to be mediated by specialized fibroblasts in ipf and tgfβ signaling pathway regulates this process. therefore, we investigated whether mir-27b influences the contractility of pulmonary fibroblasts. as shown in fig.  <dig>  mir-27b inhibited the tgfβ1-induced contractility of ll <dig> fibroblasts.fig.  <dig> effects of mir-27b on contractile activity of lung fibroblasts. ll <dig> lung fibroblasts were infected with mir-27b lentivirus or virus control , and then treated with tgfβ <dig>  the cells were mixed with collagen i and seeded in 24-well plates for 48 h. images were taken and gel areas were quantified using image j. collagen gel contractile activity was calculated as gel surface area divided by well surface area. the results are expressed as a fold change over vc without tgfβ <dig> treatment . data shown are means ± s.e., n =  <dig> *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> . anova, followed by turkey’s test




mir-27b directly targets tgfbr <dig> and smad2
because mir-27b inhibits tgfβ1-induced fibroblast activation, it likely targets the components in the tgfβ signaling pathway. using targetscan, tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> were identified as the potential targets of mir-27b . next we constructed 3’-utr luciferase reporter vectors and performed the dual luciferase assay to validate whether tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> are the direct targets of mir-27b. as shown in fig. 4b, mir-27b significantly inhibited the luciferase activities of tgfbr1-utr and samd2-utr reporters. furthermore, tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> protein expression was inhibited by mir-27b in ll <dig> fibroblasts .fig.  <dig> tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> are the targets of mir-27b. a the binding sites of mir-27b on the 3’-utrs of tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> as predicted by targetscan. b 3’-utr luciferase reporter assay. hek 293 t cells were transfected with tgfbr1-utr or smad2-utr luciferase vector together with the mir-27b expression plasmid or vector control . pmirglo is the empty vector without any 3’-utr sequences. luciferase activities were determined 48 h post-transfection. the fold changes were relative to con for each reporter construct. data shown are means ± s.e *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  n =  <dig>  c, d tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> protein levels in mir-27b overexpressing fibroblasts. ll <dig> fibroblasts were infected with a mir-27b lentivirus or virus control  at a moi of  <dig>  after 72 h, the cells were lysed for western blotting. protein levels were quantitated by image j software and normalized to β-actin. the fold changes were relative to vc. date were represented as means ± s.e., *p <  <dig> , n = 3– <dig>  anova, followed by turkey’s test




discussion
mirnas play important roles in various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and other functions. mirnas show different expression profiles in many diseases including ipf. abnormal expression of mirnas may contribute to the development of many diseases. mirnas may be potentially utilized in the treatment of human diseases, such as infectious and metabolic diseases  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated that mir-27b was down-regulated in fibrotic lungs and fibroblasts from bleomycin-induced mouse pulmonary fibrosis model. in contrast, mir-27a-3p was found to be increased in the fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of the bleomycin-treated mice although the same authors found that mir-27a-3p was decreased in ipf fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts  <cit> . additionally, tgfβ inhibited mir-27b expression in lung epithelial a <dig> cells  <cit> , but increased mir-27a expression in mrc- <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . the reasons for these differences remain to be determined, but could be due to the differences in transcription because mir-27a-3p and mir-27b are located in different chromosomes, chromosome <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  respectively. however, there is only one base difference between mir-27a-3p and mir-27b.

the abnormal activation of fibroblasts is one of the major factors driving fibrotic progression in ipf . tgfβ activates fibroblasts and enhances collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix deposition . in the current study, we found that ectopic overexpression of mir-27b suppressed tgfβ-induced fibroblast activation, as evidenced by the decreased collagen synthesis, inhibition of α-sma mrna and protein expression, and enhanced contractile ability. a recent report shows that mir-27b inhibitor increased tgfβ-induced col1a <dig> expression in lung epithelial a <dig> cells  <cit> . the significance of this regulation in lung epithelial cells is unclear since pulmonary fibroblasts are the major cells for extracellular matrix deposition in ipf. most recently, mir-27a-3p has been shown to inhibit tgfβ-induced col1a <dig> and α-sma expression and gel contractility in mrc- <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . however, a mir-27b-3p mimic was used for these studies, which may result in overwhelmed expression of mir-27a. further, mrc- <dig> fibroblasts are derived from fetal lungs, which may not be the best fibroblast cell line for studying ipf, which normally occurs in patients between the ages of  <dig> and 70 years. whether mir-27a-3p and mir-27b have the same functions or are redundant in pulmonary fibroblasts needs further investigations.

several mirnas are involved in the regulation of pulmonary fibrosis through the tgfβ/smad pathway, including mir- <dig>  mir-26a and mir- <dig> . we suspected that mir-27b may act in a similar mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis. indeed, tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> were identified as potential targets of mir-27b by targetscan. the dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that mir-27b functioned through a direct binding to its 3-’utr of tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig>  the endogenous protein expressions of these targets were reduced in ll <dig> fibroblasts by mir-27b, which further confirmed that tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> are the targets of mir-27b. using similar approaches, cui et al. found that mir-27a-3p targeted smad2/ <dig> in fetal lung mrc- <dig> fibroblasts and they also identified α-sma as an additional target of mir-27a-3p  <cit> . in lung epithelial a <dig> cells, mir-27b targets gremlin  <dig>  <cit> . in neuroblastoma cells, pparγ is a target of mir-27b as determined by 3’-utr luciferase reporter and endogenous protein assays  <cit> . in liver cells, mir-27b regulates pparα indirectly since overexpression of mir- <dig> reduced the pparα protein level, but 3’-utr luciferase reporter assay did not confirm pparα as a direct target protein level  <cit> . it appears that mir-27a-3p and mir-27b have multiple targets and which genes are the main targets may depend on cell types.

CONCLUSIONS
to sum up, our present studies show that mir-27b plays an important role in the pulmonary fibroblast activation by regulating tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig>
