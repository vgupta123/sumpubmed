BACKGROUND
the abomasal nematode teladorsagia circumcincta is one of the most economically important parasites to affect the farming of sheep and goats in temperate and subtropical areas  <cit> . this parasite is especially detrimental to younger lambs, in which it can cause pronounced morbidity and severe production losses if not controlled. control of teladorsagiosis currently relies upon the use of anthelmintics, and is complicated by the increasing incidence of resistance to these drugs, which has had a significant impact on the sheep industry and implications for sheep welfare  <cit> .

infection with t. circumcincta causes functional changes in the abomasum, including a rapid reduction in gastric secretion  <cit>  and suppression of gastric acid production, leading to increased abomasal ph  <cit>  and reduced activation of pepsinogen. gross pathology shows areas of inflammation of the abomasal mucosa, in which parasitized glands can be located at the centre of nodular lesions. histologically, there is epithelial hyperplasia and thickening of the mucosa, which may progress to mucosal sloughing  <cit> , reduction in the prevalence of parietal cells, increased numbers of mucus neck cells  <cit> , and infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils and t cells  <cit> . breakdown of the junctions between epithelial cells, possibly by mast cell proteases  <cit> , causes increased mucosal permeability, loss of protein and fluid into the gut lumen, and allows passage of pepsinogen into the blood  <cit> . clinical consequences of infection range from sub-optimal weight gain, to inappetence, weight loss, protein deficiency and diarrhoea  <cit> .

repeated exposure to t. circumcincta eventually results in the development of protective immunity  <cit> , manifested as rapid expulsion of infective larvae, inhibited parasite development and growth, and reduced fecundity of adults  <cit> . vaccination has therefore been suggested as a viable alternative to anthelmintic treatment as a means of control  <cit> . however, the immune responses to gastrointestinal helminths take far longer to develop, and develop to a lesser extent, in young lambs  <cit> . improved understanding of the differences between young lambs and older sheep, in terms of immune responses to gastrointestinal helminths, will aid the development of gastrointestinal helminth vaccines which are effective in young animals.

while the immune response to t. circumcincta is similar to that of other gastrointestinal helminths in sheep and cattle, which provoke a predominantly th <dig> phenotype response with associated up-regulation of th2-type cytokines  <cit> , the local cytokine profile generated in the abomasum in response to t. circumcincta infection in naïve and previously infected animals has not yet been reported.

in young lambs, deficiency in generating effective protective immunity to gastrointestinal parasites has been demonstrated by a number of studies in which lambs under 6 months of age failed to develop immunity following exposure to helminths including h. contortus and trichostrongylus colubriformis. in contrast, the same exposure resulted in protective immune responses in older sheep  <cit> . however, while apparently deficient in generating protective immunity to helminth infections in comparison to older sheep, young lambs have been shown to produce immune responses to vaccines containing h. contortus intestinal antigen; which in one study resulted in a significant reduction in pasture contamination with h. contortus larvae  <cit> .

previous studies of the immune response to t. circumcincta have demonstrated that lambs at  <dig>  months of age were capable of generating resistance to infection, as shown by increased larval stunting and developmental arrest following later challenge. however, this resistance was measurably less than that generated using the same infection protocol in 10-month-old sheep, in which almost all larvae were arrested early in development  <cit> .

cytokine responses in the gastric lymph node of yearling sheep have previously been examined during a trial study of infection with t. circumcincta <cit> . here we set out to compare the cytokine responses in both the abomasum and gastric lymph node of naïve and previously infected yearling sheep over the course of a challenge infection with t. circumcincta, and to investigate whether these responses differ in a similar experiment using 5-month-old lambs.

RESULTS
over the course of a challenge infection with t. circumcincta, transcription of interleukins 1β ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , interferon gamma , transforming growth factor beta one  and tumour necrosis factor alpha  was examined in the abomasal mucosa and gastric lymph node of naïve and previously infected  yearling sheep and 5-month-old lambs. the experimental design of this study is summarised in table  <dig>  due to differences in breed and surgical status, comparisons can only be made between naive and pi animals, and between the day  <dig> and day  <dig> yearlings.

parasitology
detailed post-mortem parasitology data obtained from the animals used in these experiments, including gastric contents and mucosal digests, have been presented elsewhere  <cit> . worm counts are listed in table s <dig> and s <dig> . as expected, significantly higher numbers of t. circumcincta were recovered from the abomasum of naive yearlings than from the corresponding pi group . in contrast the numbers of t. circumcincta recovered from the naïve and pi 5-month-old lambs was not significantly different on days  <dig> and  <dig>  but were significantly higher in the naïve animals on day  <dig> .

mast cell counts
mast cell numbers in the abomasal mucosa were examined as an indicator of the extent of the th <dig> phenotypic response which occurred following infection with t. circumcincta in the yearling groups . throughout the course of the challenge infection pi yearlings were found to have significantly higher numbers of mast cells in the abomasal mucosa than the corresponding naive animals . hypertrophy of the abomasal mucosa was also noted following exposure to t. circumcincta, and this was marked in the pi animals .

a more pronounced th2-type response was observed in the pi yearlings compared with the naïve. this was demonstrated by a significantly greater abundance of il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  transcripts in the pi yearlings than in the naïve group on day  <dig>  which in the case of il- <dig> was also found on day  <dig> . this response also took place earlier in the pi animals, as demonstrated by a greater level of il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  transcripts on day  <dig> compared with day  <dig> in the pi yearlings, but not in the naïve. there was a trend towards a greater abundance of il- <dig> transcripts in the pi sheep than the naive on day  <dig>  then in the naive than the pi on day  <dig>  but these differences were not significant.

in contrast to the marked differences in th2-type cytokine transcript levels, no significant differences were found in the abundance of transcripts of the th1-type cytokines il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and ifnγ, in the yearling abomasal mucosa samples.

a considerable pro-inflammatory component to the local immune response to t. circumcincta was indicated in the naïve yearlings by a greater abundance of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> transcripts when compared with the pi group: il-1β transcript levels were greater in the naïve yearlings on days  <dig>  and  <dig> ; il- <dig> transcript levels were greater in the naïve yearlings on day  <dig> ; and il- <dig> transcript levels were greater in the naïve yearlings throughout the experiment . transcript levels of il- <dig> were also greater on day  <dig> in the naïve yearlings compared with day  <dig> . in contrast, the abundance of transcripts of il- <dig> was less in the pi yearlings by day  <dig> compared with day  <dig> . no significant differences were found in levels of tnfα, il- <dig> or tgfβ <dig> transcripts in the yearling abomasal mucosa.

the 5-month-old lambs demonstrated a th2-type cytokine response which was similar to the yearling sheep. on day  <dig> the abundance of both il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  transcripts was greater in the pi lambs than the naïve.

like the yearlings, no significant differences in the level of transcript for the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> or ifnγ were found in the 5-month-old lambs.

a pro-inflammatory component to the immune response was suggested by a greater abundance of il- <dig> transcripts in the naïve lambs compared with the pi on day  <dig> , mimicking the pattern observed in the yearlings. no significant differences in the levels of il-1β or il- <dig> transcript levels were found between the naïve and pi 5-month-old lambs.

no significant differences in the abundance of il- <dig> or tgfβ <dig> transcripts in the abomasal mucosa were observed between naïve and pi 5-month-old lambs.

cytokine transcript levels in the yearling gastric lymph node

transcript levels of il- <dig> were found to be greater in the pi group than the naïve on day  <dig> . however, in contrast to the abomasal mucosa, no significant differences in il- <dig> or il- <dig> transcript abundance in the gastric lymph node were observed between the naïve and pi yearlings.

as in the abomasal mucosa, no significant differences were found in the abundance of il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> or ifnγ transcripts in the gastric lymph node between naïve and pi yearlings. interestingly, transcript levels of the th <dig> cytokine ifnγ were significantly reduced in the gastric lymph node of the pi group on day  <dig>  compared with day  <dig> 

the abundance of il- <dig> transcripts is lesser in the pi group than in the naïve on day  <dig> , however, in contrast with the abomasal mucosa, there were no significant differences in the abundance of il-1β or il- <dig> transcripts in the gastric lymph node between naïve and pi groups. no significant difference in tnfα transcript levels were observed between the naïve and pi yearlings.

the level of il- <dig> transcripts in the naïve group on day  <dig> was found to be significantly greater than that of the corresponding pi group . there was no significant difference in the tgfβ <dig> transcript levels in the gastric lymph node between naïve and pi yearlings.

cytokine transcript levels in the 5-month-old lamb gastric lymph node

similar to those findings in the abomasal mucosa, significantly greater th2-type cytokine transcript levels were detected in the gastric lymph node of pi 5-month-old lambs compared with naïve. on day  <dig> the abundance of both il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  transcripts was greater in the pi lambs than the naïve. no significant differences between naïve and pi lambs were found in the transcript levels of either the th1-type cytokines il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and ifnγ, or in the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β, il- <dig> and tnfα, in the gastric lymph node.

the abundance of il- <dig> transcripts was found to be greater in the naïve than the pi lambs on days  <dig>  and  <dig> , and that of tgfβ <dig> transcripts was found to be greater in the naïve than the pi lambs on days  <dig> .

discussion
the fact that significantly fewer t. circumcincta were recovered from pi yearlings than from the naive throughout these experiments indicates that more effective anti-parasite responses were elicited in these animals following trickle immunisation compared with the naïve. in contrast, no significant difference in the numbers of recovered worms was found in the 5-month-old animals until day  <dig>  indicating that the any anti-parasite responses generated in the lambs during trickle infection were less effective, or had waned within the seven day period following clearance of the trickle infection. the significantly greater numbers of mast cells observed in the abomasal mucosa of the previously infected yearlings compared with the naïve animals on day  <dig> is consistent with a th2-type phenotypic response during the eight week trickle infection of these sheep. in a separate investigation of the immune responses taking place in the gastric lymph of these animals, lower post-mortem worm counts and a greater degree of larval stunting were associated with a stronger iga response and an earlier blast cell response in the efferent lymph of the previously infected yearlings than in the naïve challenged animals  <cit> .

the observed difference in levels of transcripts for il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the abomasal mucosa following infection of yearlings with t. circumcincta is consistent with studies of h. contortus infection of sheep  <cit>  and o. ostertagi infection of cattle  <cit> . during the early stages of the immune response these cytokines were transcribed to a greater extent in the previously infected than the naïve sheep following challenge, which is also consistent with the responses observed during h. contortus infection  <cit> . in contrast to observations of o. ostertagi infection in cattle  <cit> , transcript levels of ifnγ were not significantly greater in the abomasum of yearling sheep infected with t. circumcincta.

these results indicate that cells within the abomasal mucosa itself appear to be a major source of cytokine production, and show evidence of a marked th2-type immune response occurring during infection of yearling sheep with t. circumcincta. the importance of th2-type responses following infection with t. circumcincta is emphasised by observations from other studies using tissue from the same sheep, showing that th2-induced molecules such as sheep intelectin  <dig>  <cit> , calcium activated chloride channel- <dig>  <cit> , ovine galectin- <dig> and sheep mast cell protease- <dig>  were increased following challenge  <cit> . sheep intelectin  <dig> was also produced earlier in the previously infected sheep  <cit> . concurrent inflammation was indicated in the abomasal mucosa of the naïve challenged animals by greater levels of il-1β and il- <dig> transcripts. this pro-inflammatory influence is consistent with the mucosal inflammation which is a feature of t. circumcincta infection.

the timing of the cytokine responses in the yearling abomasum is interesting. the early up-regulation of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the abomasal mucosa of the previously infected sheep corresponds with increased anti-parasite responses to t. circumcincta in this group. expulsion of t. circumcincta larvae occurred by day  <dig> in the previously infected group, resulting in significantly lower worm burdens compared with the naïve challenged sheep  <cit> .

in the yearling gastric lymph node there are few significant differences between the naïve and pi animals. the greater abundance of il- <dig> transcripts in the previously infected yearling gastric lymph node again indicates a th2-type cytokine response. transcripts of il- <dig> and ifnγ appear to be less abundant in the later stages of infection, which is consistent with the th2-type response and concurrent suppression of th1-type cytokine levels observed in the gastric lymph node during o. ostertagi infection of cattle  <cit> .

the differing cytokine responses in the gastric lymph node compared with the abomasal mucosa illustrates the differing roles in the immune response allocated to each tissue. early stage cytokine signalling in the abomasal mucosa is likely to be important in the initial focussing of the immune response both in terms of helminth-specific responses and their location in the abomasal mucosa, for example il- <dig> may play a role in stimulating dendritic cells to induce appropriate gut-associated homing receptor expression in the t cells activated in the lymph node  <cit> . the lymph node, as the site of induction of the adaptive immune response by basophils and dendritic cells arriving from the mucosa via the afferent lymph, is predominantly engaged in the activation, polarisation and tissue-specific targeting of lymphocytes prior to recirculation  <cit> . recirculating lymphocytes homing to the mucosa  <cit>  are therefore able to direct and amplify later stage cytokine responses in the abomasum. the cytokine responses observed in the abomasal mucosa of 5-month-old lambs were broadly similar to those found in yearling sheep, suggesting a th2-type response which occurred earlier and more prominently in the previously infected lambs, and an inflammatory response which was more pronounced in naïve challenged animals. however, in contrast to the yearlings, these lambs also demonstrated a th2-type response in the gastric lymph node with no suppression of th1-type cytokine transcript levels.

this indicates that the lower resistance and increased morbidity associated with helminth infection in young lambs is unlikely to be due to an inability to produce local th <dig> or inflammatory responses. this is consistent with the findings of previous studies of h. contortus infection of 3-month-old lambs, which demonstrated a clear th2-type response indicated by recruitment of mast cells and eosinophils, and increased transcription of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the abomasal mucosa, but demonstrated no significant suppression of il- <dig> or ifnγ in the gastric lymph node  <cit> . it is possible that the influence of th1-type cytokines in the lymph node may be inhibiting anti-parasitic immune responses due to suppression of th2-type cytokine production and/or antagonism of their effects in the abomasum in younger lambs.

the more prominent transcript levels of il- <dig> in the gastric lymph node of naïve 5-month-old lambs following infection with t. circumcincta, when compared with previously infected lambs, is consistent with the findings in yearling sheep. however, this discrepancy in il- <dig> transcript abundance was found earlier in the yearling sheep. it is possible that a delay or reduction in the development of regulatory responses in the younger lambs may contribute to the increased morbidity due to helminth infection in these animals.

the importance of the interplay between th <dig>  th <dig>  pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines is illustrated by recent studies by hassan and colleagues examining the immune responses to t. circumcincta infection in 12-week-old lambs carrying the drb1* <dig> allele of the major histocompatibility complex drb <dig>  <cit> . this allele is associated with resistance to t. circumcincta and, as well as an earlier reduction in worm burdens, carrier lambs demonstrated an earlier shift in abomasal cytokine transcription from th <dig> to regulatory and th <dig> cytokines compared with more susceptible non-carrier lambs.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here indicate that the abomasal mucosa is a major source of cytokine signalling during the development of a local th2-phenotype response and the generation of protective immunity to t. circumcincta in yearling sheep.

the more pronounced th2-type cytokine transcription in the abomasal mucosa of the previously infected compared with naïve yearling sheep emphasises the importance of these mechanisms in the immune response to t. circumcincta infection and the development of resistance to infection.

younger lambs appear to be able to generate similar th2-type responses in the abomasum to those of yearlings. however, it is possible that a lack of th1-type cytokine suppression in the gastric lymph node may be a factor in the apparent lack of efficacy of these responses in generating resistance in younger lambs following continuous or repeated exposure to t. circumcincta.
