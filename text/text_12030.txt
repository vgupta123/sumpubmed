BACKGROUND
zinc is an essential micronutrient that serves as a catalytic or structural component of numerous enzymes and other proteins and accordingly contributes to a variety of fundamental biological processes . maintenance of zinc homeostasis is very important for human health. either zinc deficiency or zinc toxicosis can lead to physiologic abnormalities . many common diseases including diabetes mellitus, crohn’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease are also linked with zinc dyshomeostasis .

zinc homeostasis is tightly controlled by a series of transporter proteins that are broadly categorized into two major families, the slc39a or zip family and the slc30a or znt family. generally speaking, zip proteins function in transporting zinc into the cytoplasm from extra- or intracellular vesicles, while znt proteins transport zinc in opposite orientations to efflux zinc out of the cytosol  <cit> . notably, some of these members also transport other metals like manganese, iron or cadmium, and sometimes in opposite directions . in addition to these transporters, metallothioneins , a group of small, ubiquitous, cysteine-rich zn-sensing molecules with high affinities for heavy metals, also play an essential role in zinc detoxification and in maintaining zinc homeostasis by buffering and storing intracellular zinc  <cit> . the transcription of mt is regulated by metal-regulatory transcription factor  <dig> , which binds to the metal-response elements in the enhancer/promoter regions of mt genes .

at the organismal level, the physiological function of zinc transporters was shown to be essential for systemic zinc homeostasis and health  <cit> . for example, in mammals, znt <dig> knockout mice die at an embryonic stage, suggesting a key function for znt <dig> in fetal development  <cit> ; hzip <dig> mutations have been shown to cause ehlers–danlos syndrome  <cit> ; and human zip <dig> has been found to be responsible for acrodermatitis enteropathica , a human inherited disease caused by impaired zinc uptake .


drosophila provides a valid model for studying metal homeostasis , and the core zinc transport and regulation machinery discovered in yeast and mammals is conserved in the fly . the drosophila genome encodes  <dig> zip proteins and  <dig> znt proteins. in comparison, mammalian zinc transporters consist of  <dig> zip members and  <dig> znt members. phylogenetic analysis indicates that these proteins cluster into distinct subgroups  <cit> . drosophila also has five mt genes, as well as the zinc-finger-containing transcription factor mtf- <dig> gene . molecular and cellular functions of drosophila zip/znt members were systematically analyzed via both over-expression and rna interference using the gal4-uas system  <cit> . these zinc transporters were further analyzed based on their subcellular localizations and genetic interactions . at the organismal level, a set of plasma membrane-resident zinc transporters was identified to participate in dietary zinc absorption. zip42c. <dig> , zip42c. <dig>  and zip89b  appear to be involved in uptaking zinc from the lumen into the enterocyte, and znt63c  and znt77c  work together to move absorbed zinc from the enterocyte into the circulatory system. the intracellular zinc transporters, such as znt86d , were not directly involved in dietary zinc absorption .

besides zinc absorption, zinc excretion and reabsorption are two other aspects to control body zinc homeostasis. unfortunately, our understanding of these two important processes is still limited  <cit> . drosophila malpighian tubules are renal organs that perform excretory functions like the kidney in vertebrates. the four tubules originate from the junction between the midgut and hindgut, and are packed as two pairs, with one pair migrating anteriorly and the other pair posteriorly . the only player that was known to be involved in zinc excretion in malpighian tubules is znt35c  <cit> , which is homologous to a set of mammalian intracellular zinc transporters including znt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 8; it was not known what other players might be involved. the zinc exporter znt35c was found localized to the apical membrane of tubular cells and proposed to mediate zinc efflux from tubular cells. interestingly, knocking down znt35c also significantly reduced kidney stone formation in a fly calcification model generated by inhibiting xanthine dehydrogenase , suggesting that zinc homeostasis in tubules is important to this physiologic process  <cit> .

theoretically, there should be at least one zinc importer involved in zinc excretion in fly malpighian tubules. in addition, from a physiological point of view, very likely one or more additional zinc transporters might be involved in zinc reabsorption, preventing the loss of this precious nutritional element under normal or low zinc conditions. in this study, we systematically studied the function of zinc transporters for their roles in zinc excretion in drosophila. our results identified zip71b as a key player in zinc excretion and dznt <dig> in zinc reabsorption. this study, together with previous work, began to reveal a primitive picture of players orchestrating the control of zinc excretion in drosophila malpighian tubules.

RESULTS
tubule-specific zip71b-rnai and znt35c-rnai flies are sensitive to zinc

drosophila homologs of mammalian zinc transporters in the zip and znt family include seven potential znt and ten zip proteins  <cit> . our previous work systematically analyzed drosophila zinc transporters for their roles in dietary zinc absorption, enabling us to form a relatively clear picture of the zinc absorption  <cit> . however, our knowledge is still limited for another important process, zinc excretion. to identify zinc transporters involved in zinc excretion, we used a malpighian tubule-specific gal <dig> line np <dig> , crossed to rnai lines of all potential zip and znt members to knock down each of them, and tested sensitivities of the larvae to zinc overload. among these zinc transporters, only zip71b-rnai and znt35c-rnai flies are hypersensitive to zinc overload .fig.  <dig> tubule-specific modulation of zip71b and znt35c expressions modifies flies’ zinc sensitivity. a expression pattern of np1093-gal4 > uas-gfp in the gut of third-instar larvae. np1093-gal <dig> is expressed specifically in the malpighian tubules. arrows denote the malpighian tubules. scale bars = 100 μm. b, c rt-pcr analysis of the knockdown effect of zip71b-rnai and znt35c-rnai flies. rp <dig> was used as internal control. d, e survival rate of tubule-specific zip71b-rnai and znt35c-rnai flies under different food conditions. both zip71b-rnai and znt35c-rnai flies show increased sensitivity toward zinc , but not other metals or metal chelator edta. genotypes of the flies are np1093-gal4/+ for control, zip71b-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ for zip71b-rnai, and znt35c-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ for znt35c-rnai. f  rt-pcr analysis of the overexpression effect of zip71b-oe and znt35c-oe flies. rp <dig> was used as internal control.  statistical analysis of rt-pcr result in ; n =  <dig>  genotypes of the flies are np1093-gal4/+ for control, uas-zip71b/+; np1093-gal4/+ for zip71b-oe, and uas-znt35c/+; np1093-gal4/+ for znt35c-oe. g tubule-specific over-expression of zip71b and znt35c confers resistance to high dietary zinc. while both zip71b-oe and znt35c-oe flies showed resistance to high dietary zinc, zip71b-oe and znt35c-oe flies displayed a synergistic effect. data are presented as means ± sem, n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> ; two-tailed student’s t test. genotypes of the flies are np1093-gal4/+ for control, uas-zip71b/+; np1093-gal4/+ for zip71b-oe, uas-znt35c/+; np1093-gal4/+ for znt35c-oe, and uas-znt35c/+; np1093-gal4/+ for znt35c-oe




to confirm the sensitivity phenotype of zip71b-rnai is zinc specific, we analyzed the survival rate of zip71b-rnai flies on food with zinc or other metal addition. to reduce the possibility that the observed sensitivity arose from off-target effects of rnai, we used two independent rnai lines of zip71b. on normal food, zip71b-rnai flies emerged with no aberrances compared to the control. however, as the concentration of zinc in the food increased, the survival rate of zip71b-rnai flies decreased dramatically; 4 mm zinc addition prevented almost all zip71b-rnai flies from surviving to the adult stage, suggesting that the zip71b-rnai flies are extremely sensitive to zinc overload. znt35c-rnai flies also showed increased sensitivity to excess zinc, similar to znt35c mutant flies as reported before  <cit> . iron, copper or zinc chelator edta addition has no obvious effects on zip71b-rnai or znt35c-rnai flies, indicating that this sensitivity is specific to zinc overload .

next, we examined the effects of tubule-specific overexpression of zip71b on survival under excessive dietary zinc conditions. consistently, overexpression of zip71b confers resistance to high dietary zinc levels , similar to znt35c overexpression. notably, overexpressing zip71b and znt35c simultaneously enabled significantly stronger resistance to high levels of zinc, suggesting a synergistic effect in zinc excretion .

zinc is accumulated in the body when zip71b is knocked down in the tubule
the above study showed that tubule-specific rnai of zip71b resulted in sensitivity to zinc overload. to analyze possible zinc homeostasis defects of zip71b-rnai flies, we measured total zinc content of the whole larvae using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry . zinc content in zip71b-rnai flies increased dramatically compared to the control flies under either normal or zinc-supplement conditions. as control, levels of other metals including iron, copper and manganese were little changed . these results suggest that the sensitivity of zip71b-rnai larvae to excess zinc is due to failure of zinc excretion in the tubules, resulting in excessive zinc accumulation in the body.fig.  <dig> zinc is accumulated in the body of zip71b-rnai fly. a, b metal contents in zip71b-rnai larvae on normal and 1 mm zinc-supplemented food. tubule-specific rnai of zip71b led to a significant increase in whole-body zinc content but no other metal content in both normal food and 1 mm zinc food. metal content values represent three independent icp-ms measurements and are normalized to dry body weight; data are presented as means ± sem, n =  <dig>  *** p <  <dig> ; two-tailed student’s t test. c real-time analysis showing up-regulation of mtnb in zip71b-rnai larvae on normal and 1 mm zinc-supplemented food. rp <dig> was used as the reference gene for normalization. mtnb expression was shown as ratios relative to that of wild-type larvae raised on normal food. values are presented as means ± sem; n =  <dig>  ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> , two-tailed student’s t test. genotypes of the flies are np1093-gal4/+ for control and zip71b-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ for zip71b-rnai




mt b  expression is sensitive to zinc increases in the cell. we thus preformed a real-time pcr analysis to test the transcription level of mtnb in zip71b-rnai and wild-type larvae. compared to that in normal food, both wild-type and zip71b-rnai flies show a dramatic increase in mtnb transcription when reared on 1 mm zinc. in the normal food, the mtnb rna level of zip71b-rnai larvae was about 400% of that of the normal wild-type, while in the presence of 1 mm zinc supplementation the mtnb rna level of zip71b-rnai larvae was about 200% of that of the normal wild-type . this result is consistent with the notion that an increase of zinc level occurred in zip71b-rnai flies.

endogenous zip71b localizes to the basolateral membrane of malpighian tubule cells
according to flyatlas data  <cit> , zip71b transcript is mainly found in the malpighian tubules. in order to examine its endogenous protein expression pattern, especially in subcellular locations, we generated an antibody against zip71b. in dissected guts of wild-type third-instar larvae, zip71b immunoreactivity was most prominent in the malpighian tubules . the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by a significantly reduced staining in zip71b-rnai larvae .fig.  <dig> zip71b is localized to the basolateral membrane to import zinc into the tubular cells. a–c expression pattern and intracellular localization of zip71b. zip71b expression  in the malpighian tubules of control larvae  and zip71b-rnai larvae  grown on normal food. arrows denote malpighian tubules. scale bars = 100 μm. c zip71b  is localized on plasma membrane and restricted to the basolateral side of tubule cells. dapi  shows the nucleus. arrowheads indicate the basolateral membranes, and arrows indicate the apical membranes. scale bars = 20 μm. genotypes of the flies used are np1093-gal4/+ for control and zip71b-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ for zip71b-rnai. d, e

the subcellular localization of endogenous zip71b was revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy under high magnification. zip71b was found to be localized on the plasma membrane and restricted to the basolateral side of the tubular cells . considering that zip71b is a zip member, the basolateral distribution of zip71b is consistent with its role in zinc excretion, i.e., absorbing zinc from circulation into the tubular cells.

given that immunostaining of zip71b also revealed slight expression in the intestine, implying a possible excretion role of zip71b/dzip <dig> in the midgut, we additionally analyzed the roles of zip71b/dzip <dig> and znt35c for zinc excretion in the intestine. to address this, we used a midgut-specific driver np <dig>  np <dig> predominantly activates expression in the midgut, with undetectable activity in the malpighian tubes, as confirmed with uas-gfp as the activity reporter . knocking down zip71b/dzip <dig> or znt35c in the midgut made the flies slightly more susceptible to zinc overdose , suggesting that under zinc stress, the malpighian tubes are the predominant organ for detoxification whereas the intestine likely plays an auxiliary role.

zip71b acts in concert with znt35c to move zinc across the tubular cells in zinc excretion

mtnb-eyfp transgene flies, wherein an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  cdna is inserted behind the regulatory region of the zinc responsive gene mtnb, can be used as an indicator of intracellular zinc levels. mtnb-eyfp flies have been successfully used in monitoring zinc levels in the midgut constriction before . to analyze possible alterations of tubular zinc level in znt35c-rnai and zip71b-rnai larvae, we crossed in the mtnb-eyfp transgene. normal larvae raised on zinc-supplemented food show dramatically induced signal of mtnb-eyfp in both the tubules and posterior midgut, confirming that zinc accumulation in these tissues can be reflected by an increase of mtnb-eyfp fluorescence signal .

we then tested the mtnb-eyfp fluorescence signal in znt35c-rnai and zip71b-rnai larvae. znt35c is reported to be localized to the apical membrane of malpighian tubule cells, so our prediction is that knockdown of znt35c might accumulate zinc in tubule cells. indeed, on both normal and zinc-supplemented food, znt35c-rnai flies showed dramatically increased mtnb-eyfp fluorescence signal in tubules compared to the control , consistent with its role in moving zinc out from tubule cells to the lumen. in contrast, in zip71b-rnai flies, no significant change in mtnb-eyfp signal was seen in the normal food condition compared to the control . further, when 1 mm zinc was supplemented in the diet, the mtnb-eyfp signal induction normally observed in the wild-type larvae was much less remarkable in the zip71b-rnai tubules, while the mtnb-eyfp signal intensity in the posterior midgut remains unchanged . these results indicate that zinc failed to be imported into the tubule cells in zip71b-rnai flies.

if zip71b is responsible for zinc import into, and znt35c for zinc efflux out of, the tubule cells, we expect znt35c functions downstream of zip71b. to confirm this epistatic relationship, we checked mtnb-eyfp signal in zip71b and znt35c double rnai animals. as expected, in the double rnai larvae, mtnb-eyfp signal was significantly decreased in malpighian tubules on zinc-supplemented food , similar to that in zip71b-rnai animals, indicating that zip71b is indeed epistatic to znt35c. taken together, we propose that zip71b functions upstream of znt35c to transport zinc into tubule cells, and collaborates with znt35c to excrete zinc out of the body to maintain zinc homeostasis.

zip71b expression is regulated by dietary zinc
from a physiological point of view, zinc excretion activity increases in response to whole-body zinc stress. we therefore asked whether the expression of zip71b in malpighian tubules is subject to zinc regulation. we reared normal flies on standard and zinc supplemented diets, and examined the mrna level of zip71b in dissected malpighian tubules using real-time pcr analysis. the expression levels of zip71b were higher in flies fed zinc supplemented food, similar to that of the other zinc excretion gene znt35c . the zinc-inducibility of zip71b expression was further confirmed by immunostaining in malpighian tubules .fig.  <dig> both zip71b and znt35c expressions are responsive to zinc. a real-time analysis of mrna levels of zip71b and znt35c in dissected malpighian tubules of wild-type animals cultured with normal food or 1 mm zinc-supplemented food. zip71b was significantly induced by 1 mm zinc , as znt35c . means ± sem; n =  <dig>  two-tailed student’s t test. b immunostaining reveals that zip71b is upregulated by dietary zinc addition in malpighian tubules . scale bars = 50 μm




human zip <dig> can complement loss of zip71b function
the protein encoded by zip71b shares the highest homology with human zip <dig> . interestingly, rodent zip <dig>  was also found to be localized to the basolateral membrane of mouse intestinal enterocytes where it plays an important role in zinc excretion  <cit> . to test whether hzip <dig> can functionally rescue the zinc sensitive phenotype of zip71b-rnai flies, we generated uas-hzip <dig> transgenic flies, introduced the transgene by crossing them with zip71b-rnai flies, and used the np1093-gal <dig> line to drive the tubular expression. as shown in fig. 5b, expression of hzip <dig> can partially but significantly rescue the survival of zip71b-rnai flies on zinc-supplemented food, while as control, expression of hzip <dig> showed no obvious rescue effect. these results suggest zip71b is not only most homologous to mammalian zip <dig> in protein sequence, but functions analogously. we thus propose zip71b as dzip <dig> fig.  <dig>

dznt <dig> functions in zinc reabsorption in drosophila malpighian tubules
zinc reabsorption is another important process for zinc homeostasis; however, it remains unknown which zinc transporter is involved in zinc reabsorption in malpighian tubules. dznt <dig> was reported to be localized on the basolateral membrane of malpighian tubule cells. this distribution pattern of dznt <dig> suggested its role in zinc reabsorption  <cit> . to verify this hypothesis, we examined the survival rate of dznt1-rnai flies driven by np1093-gal <dig>  while dznt1-rnai flies showed no obvious defect on normal food and zinc-chelated food, they were much more resistant to high levels of dietary zinc  .fig.  <dig> tubule-specific dznt <dig> rnai flies display resistance to high dietary zinc. a survival rate of dznt1-rnai flies on different food conditions. there is no effect on survival of dznt1-rnai flies on normal and zinc-chelated  food compared to control flies. however, dznt1-rnai flies survived significantly better on high dietary zinc  compared to wild-type flies. b knocking down dznt <dig> in the tubule could not suppress zinc sensitivity of zip71b-rnai flies. data are presented as means ± sem; n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , two-tailed student’s t test. genotypes of the flies used are np1093-gal4/+ , dznt1-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ , zip71b-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+  and dznt1-rnai/zip71b-rnai; np1093-gal4/+ 




to investigate the genetic interaction between dznt <dig> and zip71b  in malpighian tubules, we made dznt <dig>  zip71b double rnai flies by recombining them together. since dznt1-rnai flies are more resistant to zinc overload presumably due to reduced zinc reabsorption, we asked whether knockdown of dznt <dig> in tubules could rescue the zinc sensitivity phenotype of zip71b-rnai flies. the survival assay on 1 mm zinc-supplemented food showed that the double rnai flies are still sensitive to excess zinc, to a similar extent as the zip71b-rnai flies . these results indicate that zip71b  is epistatic to dznt <dig>  and in this case, dznt <dig> functions downstream of zip71b/dzip <dig> in tubules for zinc recovery from excretion.

tubule-specific inhibition of zip71b  and znt35c suppresses the formation of tubule stones caused by inhibition of xanthine dehydroxylase
a recent work showed that zinc metabolism in malpighian tubules is related to ‘kidney stone’ formation in drosophila; a reduction of the zinc level in the tubular lumen led to decreased stone formation. three znt members , when ubiquitously knocked down, were identified to be involved in this process  <cit> . we used tubule-specific np <dig> instead of the original ubiquitous gal <dig> line to knock down these genes, and found that tubule-specific suppression of znt35c, but not dznt <dig> and znt41f, affected tubular stone formation. these results suggest that dznt <dig> and znt41f may mediate tubular zinc homeostasis mostly in an indirect way. dznt <dig>  for example, is a key protein for dietary zinc absorption in addition to its role in the tubular zinc reabsorption. consistent with its essential role in the tubular zinc homeostasis, tubule-specific knockdown of zip71b also suppressed the stone formation .fig.  <dig> tubule-specific inhibition of zip71b and znt35c suppresses the formation of tubule stones. representative tubule images taken from different groups of flies. scale bars = 200 μm. tubule-specific rnai of xdh resulted in significantly increased tubule stone formation compared to controls. knockdown of zip71b or znt35c in malpighian tubules significantly suppressed the stone formation, while knockdown of dznt <dig> or znt41f displayed no obvious fly stone reduction. genotypes of the flies are np1093-gal4/+ , xdh-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ , znt35c-rnai/+; xdh-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ , dznt1-rnai/+; xdh-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ , znt41f-rnai/+; xdh-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ , zip71b-rnai/+; xdh-rnai/+; np1093-gal4/+ 




discussion
zinc homeostasis in drosophila is controlled by multiple biological processes. in this work, we focused on zinc excretion in drosophila malpighian tubules. using the tubule-specific gal <dig> line np <dig>  we knocked down all the ten zip members and seven znt members individually to screen for the zinc transporters participating in zinc excretion in malpighian tubules. zip71b/dzip <dig> was found to be involved in this process. zip71b-rnai flies displayed no developmental aberrance on normal media; however, knockdown of zip71b/dzip <dig> led to hypersensitivity to zinc overload, similar to znt35c-rnai flies. fine analysis revealed that, in contrast to znt35c rnai, knockdown of zip71b/dzip <dig> resulted in decreased zinc content in the tubules. we concluded that zip71b/dzip <dig> acts upstream of znt35c to drive zinc excretion from the body, while dznt <dig> fulfills the task of zinc reabsorption. all three players work together to regulate the zinc excretory process in the malpighian tubules.

it is quite remarkable that zip71b is most homologous to hzip <dig>  and hzip <dig> can partially substitute drosophila zip71b’s function in malpighian tubules while hzip <dig> cannot. mzip <dig> has relatively high expression level in mouse kidneys  <cit> , just like zip71b in the malpighian tubules. why can hzip <dig> not rescue dzip71b/dzip <dig>  given that both are zinc importers? we think this is likely due to the fact that zip71b/dzip <dig> has to be located to the basolateral side of the tubule cells to function properly, and hzip <dig> may lack the proper signal sequence or structure to be targeted there. if a zinc importer is not correctly positioned, it is hard to fulfill its task of unidirectional mobilization of zinc from the circulation to the tubular cells.

malpighian tubules, affiliated with the intestine, are renal organs of drosophila that perform excretory and osmoregulatory functions, similar to kidney in vertebrates and mammals. in zinc excretion studies conducted in mammals, the results of isotropic tracer studies suggest that most zinc is excreted through intestinal cells under normal zinc conditions  <cit> , and mzip <dig> is involved in this process  <cit> . similar results were also found in c. elegans; ttm- <dig>  one of the cation diffusion facilitator family members, was shown to work in intestinal cells to promote zinc excretion, protecting animals from zinc toxicity  <cit> . in drosophila, we found that main zinc excretion occurs in malpighian tubules. why this difference? in our experiment, zinc excretion was functionally analyzed under zinc excess or toxic conditions. it is possible that under normal conditions, most zinc excreted will be re-absorbed by the tubules; in this case, little will be really excreted, similar to what was found in mammalian zinc isotope studies. notably, znt35c and zip71b/dzip <dig> are also expressed in drosophila midgut, and functionally participate in zinc excretion as midgut-specific knockdown of these two genes resulted in sensitivity to zinc excess, albeit to a lesser extent. in light of this, we speculate that, under normal conditions, more zinc might be excreted in the midgut while zinc is mostly reabsorbed in the malpighian tubules; and when zinc is in excess, most zinc is detoxified through the malpighian tubules; this might also happen in mammals. this notion is supported by the observation that whole body knockout of mzip <dig> displays additional zinc accumulation in the liver, compared to intestine-specific knockout of mzip <dig>  <cit> , suggesting intestine is not the only important zinc excretion route in mammals. it is possible that mzip <dig>  as a zinc importer, is involved in mouse kidney zinc excretion. therefore, current data suggests a somewhat similar process of zinc excretion and control may occur in mammals and the fly. proteins playing analogous roles to drosophila znt35c and dznt <dig> during zinc excretion/reabsorption in mammalian kidneys remain to be identified.

how regulation of zip <dig> and zip71b/dzip <dig> expressions is achieved might be a complex story, and not yet well characterized. it has been reported that mzip <dig> gets internalized and degraded under zinc deficiency conditions  <cit> . burke’s lab has reported that zip71b/dzip <dig> is a highly efficient transporter, much more potent than other zip members; it is the only zip protein that was found to cause zinc toxicity phenotype in eyes when expressed alone  <cit> . the absence of any detectable zip71begfp signal in larval salivary glands was interpreted by the fact that zip71b/dzip <dig> might be down-regulated at the protein level to prevent zinc toxicity caused by excess zinc uptake. we found that zip71b/dzip <dig> responds to zinc excess in the malpighian tubules by an increase in transcription. it is possible that zip5/zip71b expression is differentially regulated by zinc in different tissues. despite this difference, they are alternative strategies to achieve the same goal, i.e., to effectively and economically regulate zinc transport in response to zinc levels or body zinc needs.

CONCLUSIONS
zinc excretion and reabsorption are important processes for whole-body zinc homeostasis control; however, the mechanisms of these controls are not well understood. drosophila malpighian tubules, functionally similar to mammalian kidneys, offer a model to study this intricate process. by systematically analyzing the roles of zinc transporters in drosophila zinc excretion processes, we found that zip71b /dzip <dig>  which is localized to the basolateral membrane of tubule cells, functions in transporting zinc from body into malpighian tubules, and acts in concert with apically resident znt35c  to pump zinc out of the body to maintain zinc homeostasis. both zip71b/dzip <dig> and znt35c are subject to zinc regulation. dznt <dig> , on the other hand, is responsible for zinc reabsorption in malpighian tubules. this study helps sketch out, for the first time in animals, a model of zinc excretion process . these findings will be helpful for zinc excretion research in general, and provide a reference for future understanding of zinc metabolism in higher animals.fig.  <dig> a model for zinc excretion in drosophila malpighian tubules. zinc homeostasis in drosophila malpighian tubules is mediated by a set of plasma membrane-resident zinc transporters. zip71b  is localized to the basolateral membrane of tubule cells and responsible for zinc import from the body into malpighian tubules. znt35c is localized to the apical membrane of tubule cells and pumps zinc out into tubule lumen. zip71b/dzip <dig> and znt35c act in concert for moving zinc across the tubule cells in zinc excretion. dznt <dig> is localized to the basolateral membrane of tubule cells and functions in zinc reabsorption to recover zinc from excretion. the transcription of zip71b/dzip <dig> and znt35c is subject to the regulation of zinc ion
