BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin-proteasome system  plays important roles in targeted protein degradation, thereby regulating a variety of cellular processes . ubiquitination reactions are catalyzed by the sequential actions of e <dig> ubiquitin activating enzymes, e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. multiple ubiquitin molecules can be attached to the existing ubiquitin moieties on the protein substrates to form polyubiquitin chains and the polyubiquitinated proteins are usually then degraded by the 26s proteasome.

the ups regulates many processes in plants, including development and biotic/abiotic stress responses . this broad spectrum of functions is made possible by the large number of genes encoding components in the ups. plants usually contain a few e <dig> enzymes, tens of e <dig> enzymes, and hundreds of e <dig> ligases, which determine substrate specificities. therefore, the numerous e <dig> ligases can potentially ubiquitinate many proteins. moreover, the modular design of multimeric e <dig> ubiquitin ligases including the skp1-cul1-f-box  complexes greatly expands the likely number of proteins that can be specifically ubiquitinated. the subunits of scf complexes are encoded by multi-gene families, especially the f-box proteins, which are encoded by hundreds of genes in plants. thus, the combination of these components can form various scf complexes to ubiquitinate numerous substrate proteins.

genetic studies indicate that plant f-box proteins are involved in hormone signaling pathways, self-incompatibility, developmental processes, and others. among the f-box proteins important for hormone signaling, transport inhibitor response  <dig>  is a receptor of auxin and the scftir <dig> ubiquitin ligase facilitates the degradation of aux/iaa proteins, which are repressors of auxin-induced gene expression . the f-box protein coronatine insensitive  <dig>  has a similar mechanism in regulating jasmonic acid  signaling; coi <dig> is a receptor of ja and scfcoi <dig> destabilizes jaz proteins, thereby releasing the transcription factor myc <dig> for the activation of ja-responsive genes . other signaling pathways for hormones such as ethylene, gibberellic acid , and abscisic acid  also require components of the ups  <cit> . in addition, s-locus f-box proteins  function as the pollen-specific determinants of self-incompatibility . the f-box protein unusual floral organs  is important for normal meristem identity and floral organ development . ufo can interact with leafy genetically to activate ap <dig> expression .

the arabidopsis homolog of the yeast and human skp <dig> genes, the arabidopsis skp1-like <dig> , encodes an scf subunit that bridges cullin and f-box proteins  <cit> . it has been shown that ask <dig> can interact with f-box proteins ufo  <cit> , coi <dig>  <cit> , tir <dig>  <cit> , and others  <cit> . since these f-box proteins have important roles in different pathways, ask <dig>  as a key component in scfs, likely has crucial functions in many processes. this was suggested by previous genetic studies of the ask <dig> mutant, which has defects in male meiosis, floral organ development, and vegetative growth . although a few substrates of scfs have been identified in arabidopsis, they are mainly specific to the well-studied f-box proteins described above. a large number of other ask1-interacting f-box proteins and their substrates remain elusive, as do the biological pathways regulated by e3s containing ask <dig> 

most of the known ubiquitin ligase substrates were identified by protein-protein interaction methods, usually when the f-box protein has a known function . recently, mass spectrometry -based proteomics approaches have been increasingly applied in various areas including differential gene expression, post-translational modifications, disease marker discovery, as well as the identification of ubiquitin ligase substrates either by detection of ubiquitinated proteins  <cit> , or by comparing proteomes of wild-type  and ubiquitin ligase mutants  <cit> . in this study, we used a proteomics approach, multidimensional protein identification technology , to identify floral proteins potentially regulated by ask <dig> by comparing floral bud proteomes of wt and ask <dig> mutant plants. furthermore, we performed comparative transcriptomics analysis of wt and ask <dig> floral buds to investigate the effect of ask <dig> on gene expression. the integrated transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed that many proteins are potentially regulated by ask1-e3s. we discuss several possible ways of how ask <dig> might regulate protein stability and further downstream gene expression.

RESULTS
transcriptomic analysis of ler and ask <dig> floral buds
to determine the effect of the ask <dig> mutation on the floral transcriptome, wt  and ask <dig> floral bud transcriptomes were analyzed using genechip arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array. the average values from ler and ask <dig> microarrays were compared to find genes whose rna levels differ by at least two fold and student’s t-test p-value <  <dig> . we found that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in ask <dig> transcriptome compared with ler . we used agrigo  <cit>  to determine if certain gene categories are over-represented in the up-/down-regulated genes in ask <dig>  we found that genes are enriched in the go categories of responsive to various stimuli or stresses . among the  <dig> down-regulated genes  in ask <dig>   <dig> genes are related to biotic/abiotic signaling pathways , including hormone, light/circadian, temperature, salt, and other signaling pathways. among the  <dig> up-regulated genes in ask <dig>   <dig> genes were annotated to be involved in response to various biotic/ abiotic signals . the molecular functions of most of these genes are not well understood except for evidence from transcriptional responses to stimuli  and sequence homology with well-characterized proteins or protein domains .fig.  <dig> go categories of stimulus/stress responsive genes enriched in the up-/down-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome. a go categories of stimulus/stress responsive genes enriched in the up-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome. b go categories of stimulus/stress responsive genes enriched in the down-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome. background percentage  represents the proportion of all annotated genes of each go category within the total genes in the ath <dig> microarray. ask <dig> percentage  represents the proportion of up-/down-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome of each go category within the total genes in the ath <dig> microarray

nevertheless, several genes have been functionally characterized, including circadian clock associated  <dig> , late elongated hypocotyl , jasmonate-zim-domain protein  <dig> , and jaz <dig>  cca <dig> and lhy encode myb-like transcription factors that synergistically regulate circadian rhythm of arabidopsis  <cit>  and thus are important for coordinating internal physiological activities with external environmental cues. jaz genes are induced by ja through a feedback loop involving jaz proteins and the g-box-binding myc2: jaz proteins bind to and repress the activity of myc <dig> in the absence of ja; upon perception of ja, jaz proteins are degraded after ubiquitination by scfcoi <dig> and the released myc <dig> can activate transcription of downstream genes, including jaz genes  <cit> . according to this feedback regulatory model, it is expected that the ask <dig> mutation would reduce scf activities, allowing jaz proteins to accumulate and repress myc <dig> activity and thus reducing the jaz transcript levels. however, we found that jaz <dig> and jaz <dig> transcript levels were unexpectedly higher in the ask <dig> mutant than in wt. this paradox suggests that an uncharacterized mechanism may be involved in modulating the ja signaling pathway. for example, ask1-containing scfs might facilitate the removal of a yet unidentified transcription activator that has the ability of inducing the expression of jaz genes in the absence of ja; when ask <dig> is mutated this transcriptional activator is stabilized, thereby inducing the expression of downstream genes including jaz <dig> and jaz <dig>  further studies are needed to uncover new aspects of these regulatory networks.

we then analyzed possible overrepresentation of cis-elements in the putative promoter regions of these up-/down-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome. the frequencies of 6-mer motifs within the 500 bp and 1000 bp putative promoter regions were determined using the motif analysis tool from the arabidopsis information resource  . the g-box  is overrepresented in the putative promoter regions of up-/down-regulated genes, suggesting that corresponding genes might be regulated by g-box-binding transcription factors, which themselves or whose co-factors might be regulated by ask1-e <dig> ligases, similar to the jaz-myc <dig> model. some of these transcription factors or co-factors might be short-lived repressors; when they are stabilized in the absence of ask <dig>  their target genes are then down-regulated. others may function as unstable activators, whose stabilization in the absence of ask <dig> results in up-regulation of downstream genes. alternatively, some transcription factors may have dual functions, both activation and repression, as is true for myc <dig>  <cit> . the fact that the genes whose promoters contain these cis-elements are altered in transcription in the ask <dig> mutant suggests that the protein levels of the corresponding transcription factors were changed in ask <dig>  another motif, gataag , was enriched in the down-regulated genes in ask <dig>  the i box was previously found to be enriched in promoters of light-regulated genes  <cit>  and is required for arabidopsis rbcs-1a expression  <cit> . further experiments are required to test whether the putative cis-elements are functional and to identify cognate transcription factors that connect ask1-e <dig> regulation with transcriptional changes.table  <dig> top five enriched cis-elements in the putative promoter regions of down-/up-regulated genes in the ask <dig> transcriptome

the enrichment of biotic/abiotic stress related genes in the up-/down-regulated genes in the transcriptome of ask <dig> mutant floral buds has several possible implications. first, the up-regulation of  <dig> biotic/abiotic stress related genes in ask <dig> floral buds  suggests the expression of such genes might be tightly constrained to avoid unnecessary expression to ensure continuous and maximal allocation of resources to reproductive organs. in wt floral buds, the expression of these genes may be turned off due to degradation of positive transcriptional regulators by ask1-e3-mediated ubiquitination, but stresses might block the degradation of such positive regulators. second, the observation that  <dig> genes annotated as stress responsive were down-regulated in ask <dig> floral buds  compared with wt floral buds suggests their involvement in normal flower development. although these genes are annotated as responsive to biotic/abiotic signals, they could be triggered by endogenous signals such as programmed cell death  and/or controlled dehydration during later stages of anther and pollen development  <cit> . however, the lack of cell-type-specific transcriptome information makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the transcriptome reprogramming for these developmentally-controlled processes resembles stress responses. in summary, ask1-e3s might destabilize proteins that are involved in the complex regulations of signaling pathways in normal flower development or in response to external stimuli.

proteomic analysis of ler and ask <dig> floral buds
to probe the effect of ask <dig> on the floral proteome and to identify potential substrates of ask1-e3s, we used a label-free proteomic method, mudpit, to analyze floral bud proteomes of the ask <dig> mutant and ler . total protein extracts of four ler and five ask <dig> floral bud samples were digested in-solution with trypsin without pre-separation to maximize digestion of proteins with different properties  and compartmentalization . mudpit runs of the four ler samples  detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins, respectively, with a false discovery rate  of <1 %, . when the four datasets were merged, a total of  <dig> non-redundant proteins were detected. mudpit runs of the five ask <dig> samples  detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins, respectively, with fdr < 1 %, , for a total of  <dig> non-redundant proteins. the ask1_ <dig> run detected fewer proteins because the starting protein amount was about 20 % of the others to test whether a smaller amount of input protein extract could lead to different efficiency of protein detection. the test result did not show a huge difference in the detection efficiency when the amount of starting material was changed, i.e., the number of detected proteins is proportional to the starting protein amount. the  <dig> proteins detected in this test run were included in the total ask <dig> proteins, but excluded for comparison between individual runs with spectral counting normalization in the following sections.fig.  <dig> workflow of the integrated proteomics and transcriptomics to identify putative ask1-e <dig> substrates



the stochastic sampling and detection sensitivity of ms-based proteomics results in the partial identification of the whole proteome in each experiment and partially overlapping datasets from different ms runs. indeed, analysis of our ler and ask <dig> samples produced partially overlapping sets of proteins :  <dig>  of the  <dig> total ler proteins  were detected by all four ms runs,  <dig>  proteins by three ms runs,  <dig>  proteins by two ms runs, and  <dig>  proteins detected only once. among the  <dig> ask <dig> proteins ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  proteins were detected by four, three, two and one of the four ms runs, respectively. even the proteins detected once had high confidence  resulting from very stringent ms detection and searching criteria and thus were regarded as detected.fig.  <dig> independent proteomics samples detect partially overlapping sets of proteins. a four ler samples ler_ <dig> to ler_ <dig>  b four ask <dig> samples ask1_ <dig> to ask1_ <dig>  the “1 %” after each sample name represents fdr < 1 %



proteins of some cellular component categories  that are usually considered to be difficult to be detected by ms without using detergents were well represented in our ler and ask <dig> proteomes , indicating that our method was able to detect proteins localized to the plasma membrane, organelle membrane, and nuclear envelope. one important improvement to minimize bias was that total protein extracts were digested by trypsin without separation into soluble or insoluble portions. although insoluble proteins were often thought to be recalcitrant to enzyme digestion, extensive sonication, denaturing treatments, and prolonged tryptic digestion seem to have improved detection efficiency.

detection of additional floral proteins compared with previous proteomics studies
comparing our floral bud proteomes with previously published proteomics data, we detected many additional proteins . wt floral bud proteins from two previous studies  <cit>  were combined into one dataset  containing  <dig> non-redundant proteins . compared with the previous wt, additional  <dig> proteins were only detected in our ler proteome dataset containing  <dig> non-redundant proteins and additional  <dig> proteins were detected in our ler + ask <dig> combined proteome dataset containing  <dig> non-redundant proteins. the identification of these additional proteins indicates that proteomics detection has not been saturated. the development of more advanced ms technologies with the capacity of overcoming the huge dynamic range of proteins in biological samples is required to further push the proteomic identification closer to saturation. until then, we have to keep in mind that there is still much room for improvement to our proteomics data and we need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from the current data.fig.  <dig> detection of additional floral bud proteins than previous studies. a comparison of wt floral bud proteins detected in previous studies  and ler from this study . b comparison of floral bud proteins detected in previous wt and total proteins detected in our ler and ask <dig> samples 



proteins detected only in ask <dig> or higher in ask1
comparison of our ask <dig> and ler proteomes revealed that  <dig> proteins were found only in ask <dig> . these proteins have accumulated in ask <dig> but not wt, suggesting that they might be putative ask1-e <dig> substrates. however, it remains possible that the accumulation of these proteins might be an indirect effect of the ask <dig> mutation. since the limited number of mudpit runs was not enough to saturate the proteome, we cannot rule out the possibility that some proteins detected only in ask <dig> could have been detected also in ler if more ms runs had been done. in order to narrow down putative ask1-e <dig> substrates, we combined our ler floral bud proteome data with the previous wt data  <cit>  yielding a larger wt floral bud proteome dataset consisting of  <dig> proteins . this pooled wt dataset represents the most comprehensive floral bud proteome currently available obtained by ms methods. the total contribution of our wt  floral bud proteome dataset to this pooled wt proteome is about  <dig>  % . by comparing ask <dig> and the pooled wt proteomes, we found that  <dig> proteins were only detected in ask <dig> ; these are thus more likely to be ask1-e <dig> substrates .fig.  <dig> proteins only detected in ask <dig> but not in wt proteomes. a comparison of ler and ask <dig> proteomes from this study. b comparison of the ask <dig> proteome with the pooled wt, a combined wt proteome from previous studies and this study



we examined rna levels of these ask1-only proteins from microarray data to determine whether increased transcription contributed to the accumulation of these proteins. the rna levels of most of these genes were not significantly different between ask <dig> and ler , except that  <dig> genes lacked probes on the ath microarray chip . therefore, at least  <dig> proteins seem to be controlled by ask1-e3s at the protein level.

because we used a label-free proteomics method, protein abundance cannot be directly compared between samples. one of the relative quantification approaches, spectral counting, has been demonstrated to show higher reproducibility, larger dynamic range, and stronger linear correlation with relative protein abundance than sequence coverage, peptide number, and ion chromatographic methods . therefore, proteomics datasets of this study were normalized using the spectral counting method as reported  <cit>  and the average values were compared between ler and ask <dig> to find  <dig> proteins with higher abundance  in ask <dig> . the previous wt data were not included because they were generated by different proteomics methods and difficult to compare quantitatively with our data. we extracted the rna expression values from microarray data for these ask1-higher proteins to determine whether their elevated protein levels were due to increased transcript levels . only the rna level of at2g <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher in ask <dig> than ler. the rna levels of other genes were not significantly different between ask <dig> and ler, except that  <dig> genes had no probes on the microarray chip, suggesting that at least  <dig> of ask1-higher proteins are probably regulated at the protein level.

ask <dig> regulates abundance of regulatory proteins acting at multiple levels
go categorization of the ask1-only and ask1-higher proteins shows that some molecular functional categories are overrepresented  . since regulatory proteins are often affected by the ups, certain categories are of particular interest, including transcriptional regulators, kinases, and peptidases/proteases. interestingly, many ribosomal proteins were also found to accumulate in ask <dig> indicating a possible role of the ups in translational regulation or extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins.fig.  <dig> overrepresented go categories in proteins accumulated in the ask <dig> proteome. a overrepresented go categories in ask1-only proteins. b overrepresented go categories in ask1-higher proteins. each “background” percentage  represents the proportion of all annotated proteins of each go category in the total proteins in the arabidopsis thaliana genome . each “ask1-only” or “ask1-higher” percentage  represents the proportion of proteins that were only detected in ask <dig> or with higher levels in ask <dig> of each go category in the total proteins detected in the ask <dig> samples



ask1-e3s affects the levels of transcriptional regulators
the ask <dig> mutation affected  <dig> transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, including some with functional information . one of them was jaz <dig>  which might function as a repressor of myc transcription factors in the ja signaling pathway  <cit> , consistent with the scfcoi1-dependent ubiquitination of jaz proteins and subsequent degradation upon ja perception . another protein detected in ask <dig> was the basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor myc <dig>  which interacts with jaz proteins and functions with myc <dig> and myc <dig> to activate ja responses  <cit> . myc <dig> binds to g-boxes  <cit> , possibly regulating promoters with g-boxes, including some of the genes that exhibited altered expression in ask <dig>  as supported by the enrichment of g-boxes in the promoters of the genes exhibiting altered expression in ask <dig> as described in the first section . the accumulation of jaz <dig> and myc <dig> in the ask <dig> proteome raises the possibility that protein stability of both jazs and mycs is regulated by the ups, adding another layer of regulation in the ja signaling pathway. in addition, eight zinc finger transcription factors and several transcription factors of other types  also exhibited elevated protein levels in ask <dig>  indicating that destabilization of these transcription factors by ask1-e3s might be important for floral development.table  <dig> transcriptional regulators enriched in ask1-only or ask1-higher proteins

the ask <dig> mutation also caused an increased level of a polycomb group protein, swinger  , which interacts with other polycomb group proteins to repress expression of flowering locus c  and controls the initiation of endosperm development . the elevated swn protein level is expected to repress flc expression. although our ask <dig> and ler floral bud transcriptome data did not show significant difference of flc expression, our unpublished anther transcriptome data showed that averaged microarray values of flc are  <dig> and  <dig>  in ask <dig> and ler anther transcriptomes, respectively, i.e., the flc level is lower in ask <dig> anthers than that in ler anthers . the down-regulation of flc in the ask <dig> anther transcriptome suggests that degradation of the swn protein in developing anthers normally derepress its target genes including flc. another affected chromatin remodeling protein is relative of early flowering  <dig> , which is a histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> demethylase  <cit>  and positively regulates flowering and brassinosteroid signaling  <cit> . our results suggest that ask1-e3s may modulate gene transcription by facilitating the degradation of both sequence-specific dna binding transcription factors and chromatin remodelers.

ask1-e <dig> affects ribosomal proteins
interestingly, many ribosomal proteins were identified only or with higher levels in ask <dig> , indicating that ask1-e3s may also have a role in translational regulation. several ribosomal proteins have been genetically studied: nuclear fusion defective  <dig> is required for polar nuclei fusion during female gametophyte development  <cit> ; piggyback <dig> influences leaf vascular patterning  <cit> ; oligocellula <dig> is involved in ribosome biogenesis and organ size control  <cit> ; and pointed first leaf <dig> plays a role in early leaf development  <cit> . ribosomal proteins might be regulated by ask1-e3s either for ribosome turnover, or for extraribosomal regulatory purposes. it was suggested that ribosomal proteins can be ubiquitinated for selective degradation of ribosomes by autophagy  <cit> . so, the accumulation of ribosomal proteins in ask <dig> might result from the failure of ubiquitination by ask1-e3s and subsequent autophagy. a previous study showed that f-box protein  <dig> , which interacts with ask <dig>  is required for efficient translation under temperature stress conditions, but the substrate of this f-box protein is not identified  <cit> . it is possible that f-box proteins, such as fbp <dig>  may regulate translation by ubiquitination of specific ribosomal proteins. our results suggest that ask1-e3s might be extensively involved in the regulation of translation.table  <dig> ribosomal proteins enriched in ask1-only and ask1-higher proteins

alternatively, ribosomal proteins may have extraribosomal functions, which are exemplified by the previous findings that several ribosomal proteins can block the ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p <dig> upon ribosomal stress  <cit> . therefore, the ribosomal proteins accumulated in ask <dig> might function as regulatory proteins which themselves may be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. further studies of genetic and molecular interactions between ribosomal proteins and e <dig> ubiquitin ligases are required for elucidating the role of ups in translational regulation.

it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the accumulation of these ribosomal proteins might be a side effect of the ask <dig> mutation. since the ask <dig> is a stable mutant, it is possible that long-term and large-scale disturbance of protein degradation might impose an intracellular stress which in turn affects the ribosome biosynthesis, activity or turnover. therefore, more research is needed to elucidate the link between protein degradation and ribosomal protein functions.

ask1-e3s affects regulators of protein activities
a number of kinases accumulated in the ask <dig> proteome , including some that are important for plant responses to various stimuli. among them, calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  is a positive regulator of salt/drought stress tolerance  <cit> , methyl jasmonate signaling in guard cells  <cit> , and aba regulation of guard cell ion channels  <cit> . in addition, lysm domain receptor-like kinase  <dig>  is involved in chitin-mediated plant innate immunity  <cit> , and map kinase kinase  <dig>  regulates cold and salt stress signaling and innate immunity . our results indicate that ask1-e3s normally destabilize these kinases during normal flower development, possibly to suppress biotic/abiotic stress responses in the absence of stimuli.table  <dig> kinases enriched in ask1-only and ask1-higher proteins

also affected are two cell cycle regulators, cyclin-dependent kinase cell division control  <dig>  and a cyclin t protein, cyct1; <dig>  cdc <dig> is required for male gametogenesis  <cit> . cyct1; <dig> is a subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase c complexes involved in cauliflower mosaic virus infection, plant growth and development  <cit> . the accumulation of cell cycle regulators in ask <dig> may affect mitosis and/or meiosis, as suggested by the findings that ask <dig> mutant plants have reduced cell numbers and defective male meiosis . timely removal of cell cycle regulators is likely to be an important part of ask <dig> function in regulating plant development.

we also found that snf1-related protein kinase  <dig>  /snf <dig> kinase homolog  <dig> , which was reported to be degraded during phosphate starvation  <cit> , accumulated in the ask <dig> proteome. snrk <dig> /kin <dig> was also shown to interact with ask <dig>  <cit> . these findings imply that ask <dig> might directly recruit snrk <dig> /kin <dig> to cul <dig> without an f-box protein, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of snrk <dig> /kin <dig>  alternatively, an f-box protein might also interact with ask <dig> and snrk <dig> /kin <dig>  forming an scf complex for ubiquitinating snrk <dig> /kin <dig> 

other kinases are largely unknown, but might have important functions in signal perception and transduction. for example, at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> contain transmembrane domains and could be membrane receptor kinases. in summary, the increased levels of these kinases suggest that ask1-e3s negatively regulate levels of these protein kinases to control cell cycle, plant immunity, hormone signaling, and other processes.

ask1-e <dig> affects regulators of protein stability
the peptidase category is enriched in the ask1-higher proteins , indicating that ask1-e3s may regulate degradation of peptidases, which in turn affect protein processing or turnover. four peptidases  are isoforms of 20s proteasome alpha/beta subunits, indicating that the proteasome core complex may also be regulated by ups. two ubiquitin-specific proteases ubiquitin-specific protease <dig>  and ubp <dig> were also detected in ask1-higher proteins, suggesting that deubiquitinases, which antagonize protein ubiquitination, might also be regulated by the ups. the bri <dig> suppressor  <dig> , a secreted serine carboxypeptidase, is involved in brassinosteroid signaling possibly by processing some proteins  <cit> . other peptidases are largely unknown except information from expression and homology. peptidases/proteases may normally be subject to negative regulation by ask1-e3s, thus coupling peptidase-mediated protein processing or degradation with the ups.table  <dig> peptidases enriched in ask1-higher proteins



possible ways that ask <dig> regulates gene expression
by integrative analysis of transcriptome and proteome data, we found that ask1-e3s might regulate gene expression at multiple steps, ranging from transcriptional, translational, to post-translational regulations. ask1-e3s may destabilize transcription repressors or activators to derepress or inactivate gene transcription, respectively . in the absence of ask <dig>  the accumulation of these transcriptional repressors or activators results in down-regulation or up-regulation of gene transcription, respectively. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the altered transcriptome and proteome might be indirect consequences of the ask <dig> mutation.fig.  <dig> possible mechanisms of transcriptome and proteome regulations by ask1-e3s. a ask1-e3s may regulate gene transcription by destabilizing transcription factors. the transcription factors are stabilized in ask <dig> mutant and activate or repress downstream gene transcription. tf+, transcriptional activators; tf-, transcriptional repressors. b ask1-e3s might destabilize substrate x, which positively regulates the abundance of target proteins y. in the ask <dig> mutant proteome, ask1-e <dig> substrate x and their target protein y accumulate. c ask1-e3s might destabilize substrate x, which negatively regulates the abundance of target protein y. in the ask <dig> mutant proteome, ask1-e <dig> substrate x accumulates but target protein y decreases. bars, negative regulation; horizontal arrows, positive regulation; dashed gray bars and horizontal arrows, missing regulations; upward arrows, increase in abundance; downward arrows, decrease in abundance



the proteins accumulated in ask <dig> might be direct substrates of ask1-e3s, or stabilized by ask1-e <dig> substrates . for example, ubiquitin-specific proteases ubp <dig> and ubp <dig>  which accumulate in the ask <dig> proteome , might be substrates of ask1-e3s; ubp <dig> and ubp <dig> could deubiquitinate and prevent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, whose protein levels are then increased in ask <dig>  an example in human is the herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease , which stabilizes a tumor suppressor p <dig> by deubiquitination  <cit> . ribosomal proteins may share a similar mechanism: accumulation of ribosomal proteins in ask <dig> may increase protein synthesis; alternatively, if ribosomal proteins have extraribosomal regulatory functions, they may stabilize some proteins in a similar way as those stabilizing p <dig> in human  <cit> .

in another possible scenario, ask1-e3s may destabilize some proteolytic enzymes , which can degrade other proteins , forming a double negative regulation cascade. the accumulation of such proteolytic enzymes in ask <dig> may cause reduced levels of their proteolytic substrates. proteasome subunits and peptidases that accumulate in ask <dig> may be involved in degradation of their substrate proteins, which could be detected with lower levels in ask <dig> proteome . however, it remains difficult to identify these proteolytic substrates due to lack of functional information of the proteolytic enzymes.

there are probably more proteins regulated by ask1-e3s than those identified in this study. for example, the substrates of the well-studied f-box proteins, tir <dig> and coi <dig>  were not detected except jaz <dig> . one possible reason is that, due to technical limitations, ms might not have uncovered proteins with low-level and/or spatiotemporally restricted expression , and when the substrates of f-box proteins are subject to degradation. another important reason is the functional redundancies among the  <dig> ask family members in arabidopsis. since the ask <dig> gene is expressed throughout the plant with higher levels in growing organs, its mutation is expected to cause more defects in many plant organs. however, the actual defects are milder than the expected, probably due to the redundancy among the ask family members. the ask <dig> gene is the most closely related gene to ask <dig>  the single mutant of ask <dig> is similar to wt plants, but the ask <dig> ask <dig> double mutant has severe defects in embryo development and is lethal soon after seed germination  <cit> . this suggests that the redundancy of ask <dig> with ask <dig>  and possibly other ask proteins, probably has masked some aspects of the ask <dig> function. in other words, some ask1-e <dig> substrates might also be ubiquitinated by scfs containing other ask proteins , and thus would be unable to accumulate in the ask <dig> proteome. this might also explain why most of the well-known substrates of f-box proteins  were not identified in our ms data.

for example, one new aspect of ask <dig> functions was revealed by our reanalysis of female fertility of the ask <dig> mutant, which was reported to be female fertile in previous studies . we loaded excess wt  pollen onto stigmas of the ask <dig> mutant, the dysfunctional tapetum  <dig>  mutant   <cit> , and ler , and finally we counted mature seeds from every silique . the result clearly showed that the pollinated ask <dig> pistils yielded significantly fewer seeds  than ler  and dyt <dig>  ; while the pollinated dyt <dig> pistils yielded similar numbers of seeds as ler . this finding suggests a previously unrecognized role of ask <dig> in female reproductive development in arabidopsis. studying the masked aspects of ask <dig> functions will need tissue-specific silencing of multiple ask family members, or tissue-specific ask <dig> complementation within the ask <dig> ask <dig> double mutant or higher order mutants. in addition, characterization of the ubiquitinated proteome may identify potential substrates of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitination sites within each protein, providing additional clues about ask <dig> function in related processes.

CONCLUSIONS
protein degradation is an integral part of various biological processes. the ups is of particular interest since it selectively degrades proteins, including many key regulators of many cellular pathways . however, searching for specific substrates of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases has been difficult probably due to rapid degradation of substrate proteins once they have been polyubiquitinated by e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, relatively weak interaction between e3s and substrates, narrow spatiotemporal window where the e3-substate interaction occurs, and others.

in this study, we have searched for potential e <dig> substrates by using an arabidopsis mutant that lacks the functional ask <dig> gene encoding a key component of scf-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligases and that has developmental defects, particularly in floral organs including petals and anthers . we employed a ms-based method, mudpit, to explore floral bud proteomes and detected  <dig> and  <dig> proteins in ask <dig> and wt proteomes, respectively. by comparing the ask <dig> proteome with a pooled wt floral bud proteome , we found  <dig> proteins that are unique to the ask <dig> proteome and  <dig> proteins with higher levels in the ask <dig> proteome. the accumulation of these proteins in the absence of ask1-e3s suggests that they may be targeted by ask1-e3s for degradation in wt. our transcriptomics analysis of ask <dig> and wt floral buds showed that the transcripts of genes encoding the proteins accumulated in the ask <dig> proteome are not significantly affected by the ask <dig> mutation, suggesting that these proteins are regulated at the protein level and thus are more likely to be candidate substrates of ask1-e3s. functional categorization revealed that many of the potential substrates of ask1-e3s are involved in regulation of transcription, translation, protein phosphorylation, and protein degradation. this indicates a multifaceted role of ask <dig> in regulating plant development. much more work is required to validate these candidate e <dig> substrates and to investigate their specific molecular functions.
