BACKGROUND
anaplasma marginale is a tick-borne and obligate intracellular bacterium that causes bovine anaplasmosis, a disease that has gained particular attention due to the considerable economic losses for the cattle industry  <cit> . onset of clinical disease is mainly characterized by a severe hemolytic anemia  <cit> . cattle that survive acute infection become carriers of a. marginale and organisms can be transmitted to susceptible cattle mechanically or by tick bite  <cit> . a. marginale persists in carrier cattle because of its capability to subvert the immune system using antigenic variation in which different variants of outer membrane proteins such as msp <dig> and msp <dig> are expressed  <cit> .

work on the development of a preventive vaccine against this disease began in the early 1900’s with the isolation of a. marginale subsp. centrale <cit> . this less virulent strain, originally from south africa, is used for immunization of cattle in africa, australia, south america and the middle east and remains the most widely-used and practical vaccine against bovine anaplasmosis  <cit> . this vaccine is not approved in the united states because of the risk of transmitting contaminant blood-borne pathogens that will infect cattle  <cit> . recently, comparative genomic studies demonstrated that proteins that are conserved in us strains were not conserved in a. marginale subsp. centrale <cit> .

different vaccination methods have been developed for the control of bovine anaplasmosis that range from attenuated live or killed organisms, to dna and recombinant protein vaccines  <cit> . but a. marginale derived from cell culture, killed organisms and dna vaccines induce only partial protection  <cit> . immunization trials using outer membrane proteins or a complex of linked or unlinked outer membrane proteins of a. marginale derived from erythrocytes have demonstrated good protection against high bacteremia, anemia and homologous strain challenge  <cit> . however, to promote long lasting protection, several immunization boosts may be required and in addition to this, production and purification of these components is time-consuming and expensive.

the increased use of molecular approaches such as whole genome, rna sequencing, proteomics and comparative genomics of a. marginale has identified potential virulence-associated targets that can be altered or removed by reverse genetics techniques  <cit> . this could allow the creation of attenuated organisms that have reduced pathogenicity but still elicit cellular and antibody responses that stimulate immunity without causing disease. consequently the development of genetic tools to transform a. marginale and generate in-vitro gene knockouts, or insertional mutants that can be tested for attenuation in their in-vivo environment is of great significance.

one way to create insertional mutations in pathogenic bacteria is via transposon mutagenesis, in which a library of recombinant bacteria containing different transposon insertions can be created, allowing for the screening of mutant strains with diverse phenotypes  <cit> . the himar <dig> transposon is a non-replicative class ii dna transposon that is a member of the tc1/mariner family and is often used for the creation of insertional mutants. since these types of transposons are horizontally transferred between species, they do not have host restricted functions, making them suitable for use in a wide-range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts  <cit> . in addition to this, the himar <dig> transposon does not have dna target specificity since it is integrated randomly in ta dinucleotide sites  <cit> . because of these advantages, transposon mutagenesis using this system has been successfully developed in other tick-borne pathogens such as rickettsia rickettsii, coxiella burnetii, borrelia burgdorferi, francisella tularensis, ehrlichia chaffeensis and anaplasma phagocytophilum <cit> . these previous results suggest that this system could be useful for the transformation of a. marginale.

nevertheless, previous attempts to transform a. marginale by transposon mutagenesis were not successful. previously, the himar <dig> transposon and transposase were delivered in two separate vectors into a. marginale which resulted in the isolation of green fluorescent and antibiotic resistant bacteria. however molecular characterization of these recombinant organisms established that the entire plasmid carrying the transposon sequences was integrated into the a. marginale chromosome by a single crossover homologous recombination mechanism instead of the classical cut and paste mechanism of transposition  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to evaluate first, if classical transposon mutagenesis using the himar <dig> transposon system is achievable in a. marginale, and second, if transposon mutagenesis using this system, is useful for the creation of insertional knockout mutations.

RESULTS
transformation of anaplasma marginale by transposon mutagenesis
attempts to transform a. marginale by transposon mutagenesis using the himar <dig> transposon/transposase system delivered in two separate plasmids were not successful. the probability that two plasmids are introduced at once into a. marginale organisms could be very low, especially when viability in the extracellular environment might be highly compromised, resulting in a low fraction of cells competent to take up dna.

therefore in order to promote transposon mutagenesis in these bacteria, the transposase was provided in cis with the himar <dig> transposon sequences . the phimarcisa7mcherry-ss contains the hyperreactive allele a <dig> transposase and the himar <dig> tir flanking the mcherry reporter gene and the aada gene, which confers resistance against spectinomycin and streptomycin. expression of the transposase and the reporter and antibiotic selection genes is driven by the a. marginale tr promoter  <cit>  . antibiotic selection pressure of electroporated bacteria with this construct resulted in the isolation of red fluorescent and antibiotic resistant bacteria .

mapping of transposon insertion within the a. marginale chromosome
we used roche/ <dig> and illumina high-throughput genome sequencing to determine: 1) the location of plasmid sequences within the a. marginale chromosome, 2) the recombination mechanism that allowed the segregation of mutant bacteria and 3) if these recombinant organisms correspond to a population containing insertions in different genomic locations or in a single genome site.

mutations produced by the integration of the himar <dig> transposon into the a. marginale chromosome will generate new junction sequences that are absent in the wild-type. these new sequences should include the himar <dig> terminal inverted repeats  followed by the sequence of the regions in which the transposon is integrated. based on this, the strategy that we used to map the himar <dig> insertion site involved alignment of the sequencing reads obtained by roche/ <dig> and illumina methods to two reference sequences, the a. marginale str. st maries genome sequence  and the himar <dig> tir sequence. the himar <dig> tir-a. marginale genome junctions were identified by extracting reads that aligned to the a. marginale genome at one end and to the himar <dig> tir at the other end.

analysis using illumina reads mapped the himar <dig> tir-a. marginale genome junctions into a region of omp <dig> and omp <dig> genes. interestingly these reads contained the same mutated sequence. the omp <dig> and omp <dig> genes share a large stretch of identity  <dig> nt/ <dig> nt   <cit> . the short,  <dig> nt length of the illumina reads, made it difficult to differentiate which gene contained the himar <dig> transposon. additional analysis using longer reads obtained on the roche/ <dig> platform revealed that the himar <dig> transposon was integrated within the omp <dig> gene. these reads contained a region of omp <dig> that is not shared with omp <dig>  based on this sequencing analysis the genomic location of the himar <dig> transposon in the chromosome of the transformed a. marginale, is at position  <dig> considering  <dig> as the first base of the omp <dig> start codon .

these results were verified by pcr amplification of gdna from ise <dig> cells infected with wild-type and transformed a. marginale using omp <dig> and omp <dig> specific primers . the size of omp <dig> amplicons  in wild-type and transformed a. marginale was the same. however the size of the omp <dig> amplicon in transformed a. marginale was increased by 1836 bp when compared to the wild-type , indicating that the transposon was integrated within the omp <dig> gene.

the genome sequence of a. marginale str. virginia is available only as unannotated contigs with gaps. therefore for our analysis we used the a. marginale str. st maries genome as reference. for this reason we wanted to confirm that the transposon location in the mutated virginia strain was the same as the one mapped in the reference genome. for this, combined roche/ <dig> and illumina reads were assembled and a contig of  <dig>  nucleotides identified. alignment of this contig with the a. marginale str. st maries genome showed that this sequence contained part of omp <dig> and upstream genes   and that the transposon insertion site in the a. marginale str. virginia matches the same region mapped using the reference genome.

further analysis of sequencing reads determined that there is only one transposon insertion in the chromosome of recombinant a. marginale. the reads containing the himar <dig> tir-a. marginale junctions aligned to a single genome site. although these transformed organisms were not cloned, data suggest that they are isogenic for the transposon insertion site within the omp <dig> gene.

the mobilization of the himar <dig> transposon from one locus to another is mediated by a transposase using a cut and paste mechanism  <cit> . it has been shown previously in other organisms that the himar <dig> transposon integrates preferentially into a ta site and leads to duplication of this dinucleotide upon integration into the target site  <cit> . this was found to be true also for a. marginale. sequencing analysis revealed that the himar <dig> transposon targeted a ta dinucleotide in omp <dig>  and upon integration it is flanked by a ta dinucleotide sequence . thus, the mobilization of the himar <dig> transposon into the omp <dig> gene of a. marginale was mediated by means of the a <dig> transposase in a cut and paste mechanism. this transformant of a. marginale will be referred to as omp10::himar <dig> mutant.

evidence for expression of omp <dig> as part of an operon
we hypothesize that the transposon insertion could alter the expression of omp <dig> and downstream genes. this hypothesis is based on recent work in which the transcriptome profile of a. marginale using rnaseq indicated that omp <dig> is expressed as part of a six-gene operon in erythrocytes of infected cattle  <cit> . this operon includes am <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> .

because of this, we wanted to determine if omp <dig> is expressed within a polycistronic message in a. marginale replicating in ise <dig> tick cells. the intergenic region between am <dig> and omp <dig> is  <dig> bp long, while intergenic regions between omp10- <dig>  omp9- <dig>  omp8- <dig> and omp7- <dig> are  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively . to test whether am <dig> through omp <dig> are expressed as a single transcriptional unit, total rna isolated from ise <dig> cells infected with wild-type a. marginale was reverse transcribed and template cdna was used for amplification of intergenic regions with primers that connect neighboring genes . the omp <dig> gene was not included in these experiments, because previous work  <cit>  and work in our lab showed that transcripts from this gene are not detected in a. marginale during infection of tick cells. appropriate size amplicons of the intergenic regions between omp7- <dig>  omp8- <dig>  omp9- <dig> and omp10-am <dig> gene were detected , providing evidence that these genes are transcribed as a single mrna in a. marginale infected tick cells.

rna transcript analysis
next, we determined if insertion of the himar <dig> sequences resulted in alteration of omp <dig> expression and the expression of genes downstream. for this, total rna from ise <dig> tick cells infected with a. marginale wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant was reverse transcribed and cdna used as template for pcr amplification with specific primers that were designed to anneal to omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig>  and omp <dig> in wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant respectively . the omp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, but not omp <dig>  are transcriptionally active in wild-type a. marginale, although at low levels . the himar <dig> transposon insertion into the coding sequence of omp <dig>  disrupted its expression and that of omp <dig>  omp <dig>  and omp <dig> since transcripts from these genes were not detected in omp10::himar <dig> mutants of a. marginale by this method . to ensure integrity, cdna samples from a. marginale wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant were used for amplification with specific primers of a region of 131 bp of the 16s rrna. amplicons from this region were detected in both wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant. no bands were visualized in negative controls .

since omp <dig> through omp <dig> are expressed at low levels in ise <dig> tick cells, rt-qpcr was used to quantitatively determine differences of expression between a. marginale wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant. for this, cdna generated from ise <dig> tick cells infected with a. marginale wild-type and omp10::himar mutant was used for real time pcr amplification using primers and probes targeting omp <dig>  omp <dig>  and the 3’ and 5’ ends of omp <dig> .

in order to compare these gene expression results between wild-type and omp10:himar <dig> a. marginale, ct values were normalized to the rpoh, msp <dig> and 16s rrna genes. changes in expression of these genes were calculated by the 2-ΔΔct method, and results were expressed as percentage of expression, with a 100% expression level being assigned to the calibrator or control group, which in this case is wild-type a. marginale.

although three different reference genes were used, rt-qpcr data normalization led to similar results in which there was a significantly reduced expression for omp <dig> , omp <dig>  and omp <dig> 3’ end  relative to their counterparts in wild-type a. marginale . these results show that himar <dig> transposon insertion into omp <dig> affected its expression and the expression of genes downstream, confirming the results obtained by rt-pcr and agarose gel electrophoresis. a second experiment investigated the possibility of the same effect occurring in regions of omp <dig> before the himar <dig> transposon insertion site. for this, a primer and probe set was designed to anneal with a region at the 5’ end of omp <dig> . even though there was a significant reduction in the detection of transcripts from this region  relative to the 5’ end of omp <dig> in wild-type, this reduction was not as great as with the sequences located in omp <dig> downstream of the himar <dig> transposon insertion site.

western immunoblot analysis
to determine if the decreased expression of mrna in genes downstream of omp <dig> correlated with protein expression a western immunoblot analysis using anti omp <dig> antibody was performed.

to compare the protein expression of omp <dig> between a. marginale omp10::himar <dig> and wild-type, the number of organisms per sample was quantified by qpcr using the opag <dig> single copy gene to determine the copy number of a. marginale. equal amounts  of organisms of a. marginale wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> mutant were loaded per lane. a. marginale str. virginia initial bodies and uninfected ise <dig> cells were used as positive and negative controls respectively.

western immunoblot showed a reduced expression of omp <dig> in omp10::himar <dig> a. marginale mutant compared with wild-type . the omp <dig> band of 40 kda was present in wild-type and initial bodies but was not detected in the mutant or using negative control antibody tryp1e <dig> . antibody f16c <dig> that reacts with major surface protein  <dig>  was used as a loading control. anti-msp <dig> detected this protein  in wild-type and omp10::himar <dig> a. marginale .

these results correlated with results obtained from the rna transcript analysis, showing that the transposon insertion severely affected the expression of both mrna and protein from downstream genes such as omp <dig> 

discussion
the possibility of creating insertional mutations in a. marginale not only could provide a broad understanding of gene products required for infectivity, growth or viability of this pathogen in the mammalian host and the tick vector, but also would allow the generation of genetically attenuated organisms that can be tested in vaccination trials.

here we report that transposon mutagenesis using the himar <dig> transposon/transposase system for a. marginale is achievable and it could be useful for creating insertional mutations in these organisms. high throughput genome sequencing analysis for the characterization of these transformants established that transposon sequences are integrated within the omp <dig> gene of the a. marginale chromosome and its mobilization within this gene was mediated by the transposase in a cut and paste mechanism, since i.) the transposon sequences were integrated within a ta dinucleotide site ii.) upon integration of the transposon, this sequence was duplicated and is found flanking the transposon tir at the junctions with the a. marginale genome and iii.) sequences from the delivering vector outside the transposon were not found.

although these omp10::himar <dig> mutant organisms were not cloned, they are isogenic for the transposon insertion within the omp <dig> because all the sequencing reads containing the transposon-a. marginale genome junctions aligned to the same genome site in the a. marginale/st. maries reference genome sequence . possible reasons include transposon insertion into other genome regions that are essential for growth in tick cells, or insertion into regions that cause slower growth and non-recovery of these mutants. this suggests that further optimization is required to improve transformation efficiencies and for more rapid identification and separation of mutants before they are visible in cultures.

the omp <dig> gene is part of the omp <dig> through omp <dig> clusters, members of the msp <dig> superfamily that correspond to the pfam <dig> family of bacterial surface antigens  <cit> . deep sequencing of cdna generated from total rna of erythrocytes infected with a. marginale identified  <dig> putative operon arrangements. one contained omp <dig> transcribed as part of an operon of six genes with am <dig> at the 5’ end and with omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> arranged in tandem at the 3’ end  <cit> . in order to have a better understanding of the effects of the transposon insertion in omp <dig> on adjacent genes it was important to determine if omp <dig> is also expressed as part of a polycistronic message in a. marginale replicating in tick cell cultures.

rt-pcr of intergenic regions between omp7- <dig>  omp8- <dig>  omp9- <dig> and omp10-am <dig> provided evidence that omp <dig> is transcribed within a polycistronic message in a. marginale infected tick cells. however transcripts of omp <dig> were not detected. similar results in which omp <dig> expression was not detected in a. marginale infected ide <dig> tick cells and in tick midguts were obtained by others previously  <cit> . a lack of omp <dig> transcripts suggests that this gene may not be expressed in tick cells or only at very low levels. it has been shown that, in bacteria with reduced genomes such as mycoplasma pneumoniae, gene members of an operon are not always expressed at the same levels and those genes distal from the promoter may have lower expression  <cit> .

rt-pcr and relative gene expression experiments demonstrated that insertion of himar <dig> into omp <dig> at nucleotide  <dig> from the start of the orf altered the sequence of this gene. this resulted in the loss of its expression since there was a significant reduction in the detection of transcripts from this gene when compared with the expression of omp <dig> transcripts from wild-type a. marginale.

it has been shown that in bacteria production and/or stability of mrna in regions downstream of a transposon insertion is greatly reduced, to the point where very little mrna corresponding to this region can be isolated  <cit> . insertion of himar <dig> within a gene can affect the expression of neighboring genes, as shown in a variety of bacteria and especially in other tick-borne bacteria  <cit> . therefore, we evaluated the effect of the himar <dig> insertion on the expression of genes downstream and upstream of omp <dig> in omp10::himar <dig> a. marginale. results showed that the transcriptional activities of omp <dig> and omp <dig> were negatively influenced by the insertion of the himar <dig> within omp <dig> since detection of transcripts was significantly decreased in relation to wild-type omp <dig> and omp <dig> 

although the transcription activity of regions upstream of the transposon insertion site at the 5’ end of omp <dig> dropped significantly in relation to wild-type a. marginale, it was not as severe as with genes downstream of omp <dig>  sequencing analysis determined that the transposon sense strand is found in the opposite orientation to omp <dig>  so it might be possible for transcription to read through the himar <dig> sequences and produce anti-sense transcripts that could reduce expression of sequences upstream of omp <dig>  but to demonstrate this further characterization is required.

western immunoblot analysis showed that the transposon insertion into omp <dig> markedly reduced protein expression of omp <dig> in the omp10::himar <dig> mutant a. marginale when compared to wild-type, corroborating that both mrna and protein expression from genes downstream of omp <dig> were disrupted.

the evidence presented here suggests that these genes are not essential for growth of a. marginale in tick cell culture. significant work on the possible interactions between the expressed proteins in different host environments has accumulated and offers important clues about the possible phenotypic effects of the disruption of these genes in a. marginale. for example omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> are differentially expressed in tick and mammalian cells with lower levels in tick midgut and cultured tick cells  <cit> . detection of proteins from these genes has been reported  <cit> . omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> are conserved during tick transmission and in acute and persistently infected cattle  <cit> . characterization of the repertoire of outer membrane surface proteins by mass spectrometry identified omp <dig> and omp <dig> as immunogenic in cattle  <cit> . proteome analysis using crosslinking and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry  to determine the composition and topological organization of surface proteins in a. marginale in mammalian and tick cells isolated a large protein complex and analysis demonstrated that omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> are arranged in the outer membrane as near neighbors to msp <dig>  msp <dig>  msp <dig>  omp <dig>  opag <dig>  am <dig>  am <dig>  am <dig>  am <dig> and virb <dig> in a. marginale isolated from erythrocytes  <cit> . in contrast a similar sized large protein complex in a. marginale isolated from tick cells was formed only by msp <dig>  msp <dig>  msp <dig>  am <dig> and am <dig>  although omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> were expressed they did not seem to be localized to the surface, suggesting a possible re-arrangement in the topology of the surface of a. marginale during the transition from the tick cell into the mammalian cell  <cit> .

interestingly, the number of msp <dig> superfamily members such as omp <dig> to omp <dig> in a. marginale subsp. centrale, is reduced in comparison with us a. marginale strains  <cit> . for example, closely related sequences to omp <dig> and omp <dig> are missing and omp <dig> is found with omp <dig> and a reduced omp <dig> in tandem, which may indicate an important function of these genes in the pathogenicity of a. marginale.

based on this, further characterization of these omp10::himar <dig> mutants to understand the effects of the disruption of expression of omp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the phenotype of a. marginale is of critical importance. phenotypic effects may include infectivity, tick transmissibility, stability under non selectable conditions, ability to induce immune responses and ability to establish persistent infection within the natural host.

CONCLUSIONS
transposon mutagenesis is achievable for a. marginale. high throughput genome sequencing of recombinant bacteria electroporated with a single plasmid containing the himar <dig> sequences and the a <dig> transposase showed insertion of the himar <dig> sequences into the omp <dig> gene of a. marginale. the insertion was mediated by the transposase in a cut and paste mechanism. in tick cells omp <dig> is expressed as a polycistronic message with am <dig> at the 5’end and omp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at the 3’ end. insertion of the himar  <dig> transposon within omp <dig> not only disrupted its expression but also the expression of genes downstream, such as omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> 

this work shows the utility of the himar <dig> system for the generation of insertional mutants in a. marginale, for the identification of genes involved in virulence and potentially for the development of attenuated organisms.
