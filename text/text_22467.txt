BACKGROUND
the genus lolium, which belongs to the sub-family pooideae  of the grass and cereal family poaceae, includes several important forage and turf species  <cit> . perennial ryegrass  is extensively cultivated for pasture production on a global basis  <cit> . like other cool-season grasses, perennial ryegrass is often infected with clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes that include both sexual and asexual taxa  <cit> . the asexual  taxa were previously assigned to a separate genus , but in accord with general recommendations for fungal taxonomy, have been recently been combined with the sexual  taxa within a single genus, designated epichloë  <cit> . asexual epichloë endophytes colonise the intercellular spaces of leaf sheaths, culms, and rhizomes, and infrequently the surface of leaf blades, without inducing obvious pathological symptoms  <cit> . these asexual endophytes do not produce stromata, and rely solely on the host plant for transmission  <cit> . the vegetative phase of growth for sexual is similar to that of asexual epichloë species  <cit> , but in the sexual stage, stromata are formed around the developing inflorescences and prevent emergence of the floral meristem  <cit> .

asexual epichloë species form mutualistic associations with their hosts  <cit> . benefits for the host related to abiotic stress tolerance are obtained through enhanced growth, increased seedling vigour and persistence, particularly under water stress and nutrient deficiency  <cit> . the endophyte also confers biotic stress tolerance to the host grass, through production of several classes of biologically active alkaloids. peramine and loline produced by the endophyte are active against insect pests, while lolitrem b and ergovaline are toxic to mammalian herbivores  <cit> . conversely, as part of the symbiosis, the plant provides certain benefits to the endophyte such as shelter, nutrition, reproduction and distribution  <cit> .

perennial ryegrass has been found to be host to two distinct fungal endophyte taxa: epichloë festucae var. lolii  bacon and schardl syn. n. lolii  glenn, bacon and hanlin  <cit>  and lolium perenne taxonomic group  <dig>   <cit> . distinct taxonomic groups of asexual epichloë endophytes are proposed to have evolved either by direct evolution from a single teleomorphic species, probably due to loss of the sexual state, or through interspecific hybridisation events between either sexual species or distinct sexual and asexual lineages, the latter generating heteroploid genetic constitutions  <cit> . the haploid taxon e. festucae var. lolii has been identified as a direct derivative of epichloë festucae leuchtm., schardl & m. r. siegel while the heteroploid lptg- <dig> arose as an interspecific hybrid between e. festucae var. lolii and e. typhina  tul. & c. tul.  <cit> .

previous phylogenetic characterisation studies of both sexual and asexual epichloë species have largely been based on the use of partial sequences of genes encoding highly conserved proteins such as tefa, tubb and act <dig> , including both relatively invariant coding sequences and more diverse intronic regions  <cit> . in addition, sequence diversity of the genes responsible for alkaloid biosynthesis has also been employed for phylogenetic analysis. specifically, the pera gene, which is responsible for peramine production, has been identified as potentially exhibiting a higher rate of molecular evolution than ‘house-keeping’ genes, permitting resolution of close taxonomic relationships  <cit> . gene sequences of pera, along with several of the more conserved genes, have previously been used to study relationships between endophytes of perennial ryegrass and members of the closely related grass genus, festuca   <cit> , including elucidation of the ancestral lineages that have contributed to contemporary hybrid endophytes  <cit> . in addition, use of different approaches such as morphological and physiological variation of cultured endophytes, isoenzyme variation and gene-based sequence analysis have been used to define and promote new taxonomic groups  <cit> . due to advances in genomic technologies, complete sequences from various genes have increased the reliability of phylogenetic inference  <cit> . however, differences in performance for phylogenetic studies have been reported between individual genes  <cit> . this limitation may be addressed through the use of multiple gene sequences, as a proxy for variation across the entirety of the endophyte genome.

molecular genetic markers based on sequence polymorphism may also be used to address issues of endophyte diversity, taxonomy and phylogeny  <cit> . a large set of ssr marker loci has been developed for the identification and assessment of genetic diversity among asexual epichloë endophytes  <cit> . in previous studies of perennial ryegrass-derived endophyte diversity based on variation of  <dig> such ssr markers, three distinct groups of perennial ryegrass endophytes were observed  <cit> . in addition to the well-characterised taxa, e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig>  a third distinct group of previously unclassified endophytes was identified as belonging to one or more pnt. however, ssr variation, although indicative, is of only limited value for definition of taxonomic groupings, due to the generation of data suitable for phenetic, rather than phylogenetic, analysis. nonetheless, putative novel taxa of fescue-derived heteroploid endophytes that were predicted on the basis of ssr-based phenetic dendrograms  <cit>  were demonstrated to be genuinely distinct on the basis of subsequent phylogenomic studies  <cit> .

the present study describes the evolutionary relationships between  <dig> representative perennial ryegrass-associated endophyte strains belonging to the known taxa e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig>  and the uncharacterised pnt, as well as several putative ancestral sexual epichloë species. the phylogenetic analysis was based on  <dig> full-length gene sequences derived from whole genome sequence datasets, including tefa, tubb and pera which were previously used for a corresponding study of fescue-derived endophytes  <cit> . in addition, complete sequences of three further independently selected nuclear genes  were included: dead/deah box helicase , glycosyl hydrolase  and meab protein. dead/deah box helicases are a family of proteins which are involved in various processes of rna metabolism  <cit> . glycoside hydrolases are enzymes present in a wide range of organisms which hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between a carbohydrate and another compound, such as a second carbohydrate, a protein, or a lipid  <cit> . meab is a protein that mediates nitrogen catabolite repression in fungi  <cit> . finally, the mating type  genes, which play an important role in evolution of fungal species through control of sexual compatibility, were also included.

methods
selection of endophyte strains
a total of  <dig> endophyte strains that form associations with perennial ryegrass were used for the phylogenetic analysis . the genetic properties  <cit>  and phenotypic  <cit>  properties of nea <dig>  nea <dig> and nea <dig> were formerly described. all other strains were as previously defined  <cit> , apart from e <dig>  which was originally isolated from an accession of chewings fescue . however, e <dig> was shown to be capable of stable establishment after introduction into multiple genotypes of perennial ryegrass through artificial inoculation into regenerating meristem-derived callus  <cit>  . e <dig> displays a closer similarity to previously described pnt genotypes such as nea <dig> than to representatives of e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig>  and so was included in this study, but is nonetheless distinct in genetic terms  <cit> .table  <dig>

generation and assembly of genome sequence data
genomic paired-end reads generated by sequencing libraries prepared using the truseq™ low-throughput  dna sample preparation kit  were used to generate assemblies of ryegrass-associated endophyte genomes. low-quality sequence reads were filtered out using a custom python script, which calculates quality statistics and stores trimmed reads in several fastq files. genome assemblies of endophytes c <dig>  e <dig>  nea <dig> and nea <dig> were obtained through velvetoptimiser  using default parameters except for hash length  which was in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  previously generated genome assemblies from other endophyte strains  <cit>  were used in this analysis.

identification of gene sequences
presence and copy number of tefa, tubb, pera, dead/deah helicase, glycosyl hydrolase, meab protein and mt genes in each endophyte genome were initially identified through nucleotide blast   analysis  <cit>  using contigs from the optimised velvet assembly of total reads as the database which was queried with the following reference sequences : xm_ <dig>  from metarhizium anisopliae arsef 23; meab protein: xm_ <dig>  from m. anisopliae arsef 23; mt genes: fj <dig>  , hq <dig>  , hq <dig>   from e. festucae e <dig> and hq <dig>   from e. festucae fl <dig>  following identification of contigs and gene coordinates for selected genes within the genomes of the haploid strains  using corresponding reference genes, the contig and subsequently, the relevant gene sequence was extracted using fastacmd   and emboss extractseq  , respectively. a similar approach was used to extract corresponding gene sequences from the genomes of e. typhina  <dig>   <dig> and e. baconii  <dig> based on the relevant databases. data for representative epichloë species isolates was extracted from genome sequence data available at http://www.endophyte.uky.edu/  <cit> .

a different approach was used to extract genes from heteroploid strains , due to the presence of two copies for each gene. corresponding gene sequences of the predicted progenitors, e. festucae var. lolii  and e. typhina  were used as references for mapping of all sequencing reads from lptg- <dig> strains using bowtie  . mapped reads were assembled using velvet   <cit>  using the corresponding gene as the reference to obtain two copies for each lptg- <dig> strain.

phylogenetic analysis
sequences of all selected endophyte strains were aligned using muscle, built-in version of mega   <cit> . alignments were checked manually for ambiguities and adjusted if necessary. to construct the tree topology, maximum likelihood  and neighbour-joining  methods were used as implemented in mega  <dig> . <dig> with default parameters. positions containing gaps or missing data were eliminated in constructing phylogenetic trees. robustness of inferred phylogenies was estimated by bootstrap replication , and branches receiving less than 60% of replicates were collapsed.

for the sake of clarity, gene copies of lptg- <dig> strains were appended with the suffixes gc <dig> and gc <dig>  reflecting phylogenetic affinity with e. festucae var. lolii and e. typhina, respectively. megablast searches  <cit>  using tubb, tefa and pera sequences were performed in genbank nucleotide sequence database of the national centre for biotechnology information  to identify the closest matching sequences of epichloë species, which were added to the sequence alignment. accession numbers for genbank-derived sequences are provided in each phylogram next to the isolate name.

phylogenetic analysis was also performed with the concatenated sequences. the sequences of all, except mt, genes were concatenated in the order of tefa, tubb, pera, dead/deah helicase, glycosyl hydrolase and meab protein into a multi-gene alignment which was then aligned using muscle. phylogenetic topology was constructed using the same methods as described above.

statistics for genome assemblies of perennial ryegrass-associated endophyte strains are provided in additional file  <dig> 

identification of nuclear gene copies
blastn analysis, as described, was used to identify the presence of the  <dig> selected gene sequences in the genomes of all candidate strains and reference sexual epichloë species. single copies of each gene were identified for all isolates of e. festucae var. lolii and pnt, reflecting haploid genome structures. in contrast, two copies of each gene were observed for both representatives of taxon lptg- <dig>  complete copies of the pera gene were identified in e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig> strains, but all pnt representatives showed the presence of a 1223 bp deletion at the 3’-end of the gene. furthermore, apart from strain e <dig>  all pnt strains contained a premature stop codon at coordinate 2923 bp within the pera gene sequence.

phylogenetic characterisation based on individual gene sequences
phylograms were constructed on an individual gene basis using the ml and nj methods. in all instances, except for the mt genes, the phylogram structure revealed three major distinct sequence clades. the single gene copies from e. festucae var. lolii and gc <dig> from lptg- <dig> were located in the first clade, while lptg- <dig> gc <dig> was located in the second clade. for all phylograms, the third clade contained single gene copies from pnt representatives, except for that generated from tefa sequences, in which strain e <dig> was grouped with the e. festucae var. lolii strains in clade  <dig>  the separation of the three clades was supported by >80% bootstrap values in all instances . for lptg2-derived sequences, lower variability was observed between gc <dig> representatives from the alternate strains than for those from gc <dig> 

the significant levels of divergence between clades suggest different evolutionary origins. in order to identify potential progenitor genomes among contemporary teleomorphic taxa, phylogenetic analysis was repeated to include representative isolates of epichloë species, and phylograms were constructed using both ml and nj methods. all trees resulting from phylogenetic analysis using each method were congruent in topology, which indicated similar evolutionary relationships in respect of both e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig> . again, separation of pnt strains from the other asexual taxa was supported by >76% bootstrap values in the ml analysis and >73% bootstrap values in the nj analysis, apart from for tubb, which displayed moderate bootstrap support .figure  <dig> phylogram resulting from ml analysis of tefa gene sequences of selected perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes and reference isolates, with bootstrap values  shown on nodes. endophyte taxa are colour-coded as indicated in the legend. the genbank accession numbers of the tefa genes derived from ryegrass-associated endophytes are provided in additional file  <dig>  and genbank accession numbers of the reference sequences are provided following taxon and strain identities.



in general, the single gene copies characteristic of e. festucae var. lolii and pnt-derived strains were most closely related to those of strains of e. festucae. however, contrasting patterns of affinity with specific e. festucae isolates were observed between the different selected genes. in the tubb-specific phylogram, e. festucae strain e2368- and e. festucae fl1-derived sequences exhibited a similar degree of affinity to those of each of the haploid taxa. in contrast, in the pera-specific phylogram, e. festucae var. lolii-derived sequences were grouped more closely with e. festucae fl <dig>  while pnt-derived sequences were located closer to e. festucae strain e <dig>  furthermore, strain e <dig> formed a sister group with e. festucae strain e <dig>  in the phylograms derived from the glycosyl hydrolase, meab protein and dead-box helicase genes, both e. festucae fl <dig> and e. festucae strain e <dig> were closer to the pnt genotypes. finally, a higher similarity between e. festucae var. lolii and both e. festucae strains  was observed in the tefa-based phylogenetic tree.

the genomes of the heteroploid lptg- <dig> endophyte contained two distinct copies for each gene, reflecting the hybrid origin of this taxon. while gc <dig> was closely related to those of e. festucae var. lolii, gc <dig> showed affinity to the corresponding sequences from multiple isolates of e. typhina related sequences. in all individual gene-based phylograms , as well as the concatenated gene-based tree, lptg- <dig> gc <dig> was more closely related to e. typhina e <dig>  and e. typhina  <dig> than the two other e. typhina strains,  <dig> and e <dig>  furthermore, in the tubb- and meab protein-specific phylograms, gc <dig> of lptg- <dig> strain nea <dig> was closer to e. typhina e <dig>  while that of nea <dig> was closer to e. typhina  <dig>  in contrast, in the dead box-based phylogram, nea <dig> gc <dig> was closer to e. typhina e <dig>  while nea <dig> gc <dig> was closer to e. typhina  <dig> 

identification and phylogenetic characterisation of mt genes
comparison between the genomic sequences of perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes and reference gene sequences corresponding to the mt idiomorphs, mta  and mtb , revealed the presence of a single idiomorph in all strains. mtb was detected for all e. festucae var. lolii and pnt strains, with the single exception of e <dig>  which possessed all three genes corresponding to mating type idiomorph mta. two copies of mtba were identified for each of the two lptg- <dig> strains .table  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparison of the mtba gene copies, excluding only strain e <dig> due to possession of the opposing mt idiomorph. in contrast to the other  <dig> gene-specific phylograms, the mt gene-specific tree was separated into two major clades, one representing e. festucae var. lolii, lptg- <dig> gc <dig> and pnt, the other representing lptg- <dig> gc <dig> . the mt sequences of the first clade were similar, and clustered with that of e. festucae fl <dig>  while those of the second clade were also similar, and showed affinity, albeit at a lower level, to those of several strains of e. typhina.

phylogenetic characterisation based on concatenated gene sequences
all gene sequences, apart from those of the mt genes  were concatenated and analysed by ml and nj methods, providing strong bootstrap support for all major clades that were defined by single gene-based phylogenetic analysis . in this phylogram, e. festucae fl <dig> clustered with e. festucae var. lolii, and e. festucae  <dig> clustered with pnt. however, when the pera sequences were removed from the concatenated gene structure, both e. festucae fl <dig> and e. festucae e <dig> clustered preferentially with pnt , suggesting a predominant influence of pera in the analysis, possibly due to the large length of this gene in comparison to the others .figure  <dig> phylogram resulting from ml analysis of concatenated gene sequences of selected perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes and reference isolates. diagram properties are as described for figure  <dig>

discussion
phylogenetics of previously characterised endophyte taxa
in the present study, sequence diversity of multiple independently selected genes was used to identify the phylogenetic affinities between perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes, and to interpret potential progenitor relationships with contemporary sexual epichloë species. this study represents the first use of whole genome data to obtain full-length sequence of multiple genes for phylogenetic analysis of perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes. the results revealed the existence of three major groups, confirming relationships previously deduced from ssr-based genotyping, of which two  have been previously described. limited sequence diversity for all selected genes was detected within each taxon, as would be expected for asexual species  <cit> . in contrast, the multiple isolates of the sexual species e. typhina displayed higher levels of variation, as is further supported by possession of different mt genes and substantial differences between mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .

the identities of progenitors for e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig> have been identified in several previous phylogenetic studies. the most common endophyte of perennial ryegrass, e. festucae var. lolii, has been proposed as a direct haploid descendant of e. festucae, while the heteroploid lptg- <dig> was suggested to have evolved through hybridisation of e. festucae var. lolii and e. typhina  <cit> . equivalent phylogenetic affinities were observed in the current study. of the two reference e. festucae strains that were used, fl <dig> appears to be more closely related to e. festucae var. lolii strains based on the tubb- and pera-specific phylograms, while both strains exhibited similar levels of affinity to e. festucae var. lolii in the tefa-derived tree.

the origin of heteroploid endophytes may be verified by comparison with multiple candidate progenitor species  <cit> . e. typhina e <dig>  which was isolated from perennial ryegrass, provided the closest match to lptg- <dig> gc <dig> in the phylograms based on both individual and concatenated gene sequence, consistent with a previous study  <cit> . the higher variability of gc <dig> as compared to gc <dig> may provide evidence for the contributions of different e. typhina lineages to the origin of lptg- <dig> strains, rather than a monophyletic event. further evidence for complexity in the evolution of lptg- <dig> is apparent from the mt gene-based analysis. of the e. typhina strains that were subjected to analysis, e. typhina  <dig> and e. typhina maff  display the mtb idiomorph, while the opposing  mating type was observed in e. typhina e <dig>  hence, despite the close relationships between e. typhina e <dig> and lptg- <dig> gc <dig> revealed by analysis based on other nuclear genes, a lineage similar to, but distinct from e. typhina e <dig> must have been the direct ancestor of the lptg- <dig> strains included in the present study.

phylogenetic identities of pnt genotypes
similar patterns of relationships between the three distinct clades were apparent for all independently selected gene sequences, apart from the mt genes. the pnt individuals were separated from the other two taxa with strong bootstrap support in all phylograms that included sexual epichloë reference isolates, except for the moderate value obtained for the tubb-based tree. a similar difference between confidence of structure obtained with individual genes was also observed during phylogenetic analysis of annual ryegrass-derived endophytes based on tubb and nuclear ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer  sequences. in this analysis, many branches of the rdna-its-based phylogram displayed a lower bootstrap support than the tubb-based phylogram. the discrepancy was interpreted in terms of homoplasy effects and/or the lower number of informative characters that are available from rdna-its gene sequence  <cit> . similar considerations may apply to the variability of bootstrap support observed in the present study.

convergence of gene structure between otherwise distantly related genotypes may also apply to the highly conserved tefa gene, and account for the anomalous location of strain e <dig> in the respective phylogram. equivalent patterns of relationships have been reported in other phylogenetic analysis studies. for instance, the tefa gene of the meadow fescue-derived endophyte n. uncinatum was most closely related to that of e. bromicola, but the single tubb gene showed a closer relationship to that of e. typhina  <cit> . to address such discrepancies, the concatenation approach has been developed in order to obtain more accurate phylogenetic results  <cit> . interestingly, the concatenated sequence-based phylograms in the present study displayed strong bootstrap support for the presence of a third taxon grouping, providing additional confidence in the inferences from individual gene sequence analysis.

as for e. festucae var. lolii, pnt strains exhibit the closest relationships to e. festucae among the available contemporary sexual epichloë species. however, in respect to strain diversity within e. festucae, different relationships were observed across different genes. on the basis of the primary concatenated phylogram, the pnt group showed a closer relationship to e. festucae  <dig>  while e. festucae var. lolii was grouped with e. festucae fl <dig>  however, this seems likely to be due to the influence of the pera gene, which contributes a length of c.  <dig>  kb that is common to all strains in the study, close to the combined length of the other  <dig> genes . in the absence of the pera gene, members of the pnt group seem to exhibit a slightly higher affinity to both e. festucae isolates , perhaps indicating an origin from a similar progenitor, while e. festucae var. lolii may have arisen from a variant of e. festucae that either has not been included in the analysis, or is not represented in the contemporary range of intraspecific diversity. nonetheless, the mt gene-based analysis indicates that all e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig> strains display the mtb idiomorph, either in single or double copy number, similar to e. festucae fl <dig>  it is worthwhile to consider whether the conflicting results may be an artefact of limited sampling of genomic diversity, and a definitive analysis will depend on comparison of whole genome sequences.

separate taxonomic status for members of the pnt group was also supported by evidence from chemotypic diversity. metabolic profiling for the presence of known alkaloids revealed that all of the e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig> strains included in the present study produce at least one of the three common compounds, lolitrem b, ergovaline and peramine  <cit> . however, members of the pnt group have been shown to produce none of these metabolites, but rather to synthesise another class of bioactive metabolites, the epoxy-janthitrems  <cit> . the failure to synthesise peramine is consistent with the 1223 bp 3’-terminal deletion of the pera gene in all individuals, as well as the premature stop codon at coordinate 2923 bp in all but e <dig>  in each case generating a non-functional gene copy. the presence of the majority of the pera gene, however, suggests that pnt endophytes may have possessed an intact pera gene at some stage of evolution, followed by a deletion event similar to that inferred to have occurred in endophyte strains e. typhina e <dig> and e. festucae e <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although the endophyte strains located within the pnt group are phylogenetically distinct from both e. festucae var. lolii and lptg- <dig>  evidence suggests that they may represent not one but two distinct novel taxa. strains  <dig>   <dig> and nea <dig> show near-identity in all individual gene-based trees, indicating a low level of intra-group diversity, and reflecting a probable recent origin from an e. festucae-like progenitor with a mtb idiomorph. deletion of the 3’-terminus of pera is diagnostic of this group. for these reasons, it is proposed that such members of the pnt group are now designated as belonging to a new taxon, lptg- <dig>  in contrast, e <dig>  although a sole representative and obviously closely related to lptg- <dig>  shows unique features, not least the premature stop codon that is additional to the deletion in the pera gene, and most significantly, a mta idiomorph. on the latter basis, a common origin with lptg- <dig> followed by divergence of asexual lineages is difficult to defend. in contrast, a more parsimonious explanation may involve the origin of both types from different genotypes  of an e. festucae-like progenitor which had already undergone the pera deletion, leading to establishment of two parallel lineages of asexual endophyte, further modification of pera being confined to the lptg- <dig> genomes. consequently, it is further proposed that although e <dig> did not originate from a perennial ryegrass host, it is provisionally assigned  to a fourth taxonomic grouping of perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes as a sister group to lptg- <dig>  to be designated lptg- <dig>  as both of the proposed new taxa are capable of producing the novel alkaloid class of epoxy-janthitrems, which display valuable feeding deterrence effects toward invertebrate herbivores, the definition of genomic properties of such taxa is capable of assisting future targeted endophyte discovery programs.
