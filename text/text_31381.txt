BACKGROUND
examination of the nucleotide content of various transcriptomes has revealed classes of genes distinguished by their g and c content  <cit> . in particular, the wobble position of coding sequences, which is relatively independent of the coding potential of the protein, serves as a marker for gc richness. the frequency of g+c nucleotides at the 3rd position is referred to as gc <dig>  in several earlier studies  <cit> , two types of organisms were identified on the basis of their gc <dig> distributions: unimodal and bimodal. warm-blooded animals and several plant families  demonstrate a clear bimodal distribution of gc <dig> while cold-blooded animals and other plants  show a predominantly unimodal distribution .

since bimodality has been detected in only some plant families, we suggest that this feature has developed independently in warm-blooded animals and in certain members of the commelinids clade. the gc <dig> bias could possibly be explained as a consequence of some larger genomic bias. for example, over three decades ago, macaya et al.  <cit>  observed that some genomes contain isochores, megabase-long regions with either high or low gc contents. isochores have been reported in warm-blooded vertebrates and in some reptiles  <cit> . compositionally homogenous dna regions of at least 50- <dig> kb have been found in several dicot and monocot genomes , supporting the existence of isochores in plants  <cit> . it is not yet known whether all eukaryotic genomes are characterised by an isochore structure  <cit> .

press and robins  <cit>  reported that high gc isochores contain a mixture of gc- and at-rich genes, whereas high at  isochores contain mostly at-rich genes. genes found within high and low gc isochores are functionally distinguishable by statistical analysis of their gene ontology categories  <cit> . the authors suggested that some genes require at-richness, while others, contained within large coherent blocks, have a strong bias towards mutations to gc.

the neutral theory of evolution states that for a change to come about in the population as a whole, the new characteristic must be as good as or better than the old one. under the assumption of neutrality, genes would acquire characteristics of the surrounding isochores. therefore, noncritical elements such as synonymous bases in 3rd codon positions and 5' and 3' utrs should be gc-rich in high gc isochores. in fact, several groups have found a positive correlation between the gc <dig> levels of a gene and of its surrounding genomic area  <cit> . mouchiroud et al.  <cit>  found an 8-fold enrichment for high-gc <dig> genes within the top 3% of the gc-richest isochores in humans. these observations support the neutrality assumption. elhaik et al.  <cit> , however, found little correlation between gc <dig> and isochores within a species and none between species. furthermore, the correlation with generally gc-rich areas is only modest   <cit> , suggesting that a more complex explanation must be sought. moreover, isochores have been reported in both gc <dig> unimodal and bimodal organisms and therefore cannot provide an exclusive explanation for gc <dig> bimodality.

campbell and gowri  <cit>  described differences in codon usage in different plant genomes, algae and cyanobacteria, and showed that bimodality existed only in monocots. in a series of publications  <cit> , gc <dig> levels were analyzed for five poaceae and three dicot species. it was found that compositional patterns in the dicot species resembled those of cold-blooded vertebrates, while the grasses resembled warm-blooded vertebrates. bimodality of gc <dig> distribution in grasses, and specifically in rice, was reported by carels and bernardi  <cit> , wang and hickey  <cit>  and salinas et al.  <cit> . these authors explained the differences in codon usage among some rice genes by a rapid evolutionary increase in gc content. they gave two possible explanations for the observed bi-modality:  positive darwinian selection, acting at the level of translational efficiency; and  neutral mutational bias.

several characteristics related to high gc <dig> genes have been observed to date. duret et al.  <cit>  examined vertebrate sequences and described two properties of high-gc <dig> genes: the proteins are generally shorter, and introns are either absent or short in comparison to low-gc <dig> genes. carels and bernardi  <cit>  compared genes in plants with generally high gc content to those with generally lower gc content. although the differences were most prominent in gramineae, they observed that other families of plants including dicots  could be segregated by gc distribution. they also observed the tendency towards short or no introns in gc-rich genes and identified a correlation between gc content, intron size and location among homologs across species. duret et al.  <cit>  reported a small correlation between gc <dig> and the general gc richness of the surrounding > <dig> kb of genomic sequence. the relationship between gene length and gc <dig> for many organisms has been analyzed in a number of publications during the last decade  <cit> . gene lengths in c. elegans, d. melanogaster, a. thaliana  <cit>  and o. sativa  <cit>  are negatively associated with gc <dig>  shorter genes in bacteria tend to have more variable expression levels, and selective pressure on codon usage is also higher in shorter genes  <cit> . it was recently demostrated that corn genes with high gc <dig> tend to be mono-exonic  <cit> . it has been reported that shorter and intron-poor genes have either stronger  <cit>  or more variable  <cit>  expression levels because introns can delay regulatory responses and are selected against in genes whose transcripts require rapid adjustment for survival of environmental challenges  <cit> . ren et al.  <cit>  showed opposite trends in plant and animal genomes; highly expressed genes tend to be longer in plants and shorter in animals. a recent paper by jeffares et al.  <cit>  proposed a reconciliation of these observations: both plants and animals show consistent inverse relationships between intron density  and rapid regulation .

an influence of translation on codon bias has been proposed on the basis of increased hydrogen bonding and hence strength of g-c pairing in contrast to a-t pairing. this increased pairing may improve transcript stability at the mrna level or improve the speed or fidelity of translation, thereby improving protein production, as has been shown in a number of species including bacteria and some eukaryotes  <cit> . this is supported by the analysis of campbell and gowri  <cit> , who studied codon usage in plants and found two groups of genes that had preferences for gc-ending codons in monocots but not dicots. additionally, jabbari et al.  <cit>  found a correlation between high-gc genes and amino acid hydropathy. however, wang and hickey  <cit>  used concordance analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous differences to show that the primary effect is not at the codon or protein level.

several groups  <cit>  have suggested that the effect of high or low gc <dig> may be at the level of transcription. the generally shorter introns and coding sequences of high-gc <dig> genes led carels and bernardi  <cit>  to suggest that selective pressure has driven housekeeping and non-regulated genes to higher gc contents while the longer at-rich genes have been maintained to provide more opportunity for regulation and alternative splicing. clay et al.  <cit>  looked at cpg islands upstream of gc-rich and gc-poor transcripts and found little correlation. nevertheless, the observation of higher gc within the introns of gc <dig> transcripts as well as the 5' region, and the weak correlation between general genomic gc content and gc <dig> level, suggests that the transcriptional machinery may be involved.

conflicting ideas about codon usage bias and expression levels have been published. wang and hickey  <cit>  reported that codon bias is not correlated with gene expression. using s. cerevisiae expression and sequence data, dekker  <cit>  showed that on average, gc-rich genes are significantly more transcriptionally active than at-rich genes. a recent paper by roymondal et al.  <cit>  presented an expression measure of a gene, devised to predict the level of gene expression from relative codon bias. they suggested that since the bias is caused by the presence of optimal codons that are recognized by the most abundant trna species, the high-gc <dig> peak appears as a manifestation of natural selection acting in grasses and warm-blooded vertebrates. this process shapes the codon usage patterns for selected genes to gain optimal expression levels in response to changing environments. roymondal et al.  <cit>  mentioned that within any genome, codon bias tends to be much stronger in highly expressed genes.

attempts have been made to discover an association between functional classes of genes and gc <dig>  carels and bernardi  <cit>  characterized the high gc-containing transcripts as housekeeping and photosynthetic. d'onofrio et al.  <cit>  found gc <dig> to be higher in genes involved with cellular metabolism and lower in those involved with information storage processing. these observations are consistent with previous studies of general gc contents of genes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the existence of a codon usage gradient along the coding regions was previously discussed by hooper et al.  <cit> , who outlined the possible advantages of a positive gc <dig> gradient. based on an analysis of e. coli genes, the authors suggested that g3-containing codons may be translated more quickly and with lower error rate than other codons, thus avoiding congestion at the ribosomes because of a gradual increase of speed of translation along the gene. wong et al.  <cit>  discovered that in the plant kingdom, o. sativa genes are richer in gc at the 5' end than at the 3' end. this gradient and imbalance in nucleotide strand composition extends beyond the coding region; transcription start sites are characterized by a pronounced peak in cg-skew  <cit> , and mrnas tend to be purine-rich   <cit> . avoidance of unnecessary 'kissing interactions' between and within mrnas was mentioned by lao et al.  <cit>  as a possible explanation for purine loading. species adapted to hotter environments have stronger selection pressure towards purine loading since nucleic acids are "stickier" at high temperatures  <cit> . this effect is the most pronounced at the wobble position of codons.

aside from transcriptional and translational influences, it is possible that the driver for differences in gc <dig> operates at a recombinational level. gene duplication in the poaceae has been mentioned as one possible explanation of gc <dig> bimodality  <cit> . the authors suggested that duplicated genes in o. sativa can be partitioned into  <dig> blocks by chromosomal location; these blocks have significantly different synonymous substitution rates . wang et al.  <cit>  found that ks was negatively correlated with the gc content at the third position of codons  and that the bimodal distribution of ks was split into two unimodal distributions corresponding to high- and low-gc <dig> genes. related to this idea are advances in understanding of the accelerated evolutionary rates of some genes. holmquist  <cit>  described a model in which hybridization of similar genes during recombination resulted in a bias toward higher gc content in the recombined areas. birdsell  <cit>  demonstrated that recombination significantly increases gc <dig> in a selectively neutral manner; the gc-biased mismatch repair system evolved in various organisms as a response to at mutational bias. birdsell  <cit>  suggested that unimodal low-gc <dig> species may have prevailing at mutational bias, random fixation of the most common types, or mutation or absence of gc-biased gene conversion  <cit> . the authors hypothesized that recombination is more likely to occur within conserved and regulatory regions of the genome; therefore, introns, intergenic regions and pseudogenes tend to have lower gc contents than orfs. galtier et al.  <cit>  noticed that gc-biased gene conversion, frequently accompanied by an increase in gc <dig>  influenced the evolutionary trajectory of human proteins by promoting the fixation of deleterious at→gc mutations. these observations raise the possibility that the high-gc <dig> class of genes might have appeared as a consequence of accelerated evolution.

with the increasing amount of genomic and transcript information available within the public databases as well as the improved understanding of gene conversion and gene regulatory mechanisms, we returned to the puzzle of gc <dig> bimodality in grasses in an effort to understand the significance of this phenomenon. we concentrate our discussion around oryza sativa as it is one of the best-studied grass species at the genomic level.

RESULTS
gene classes in several organisms are readily identified by gc <dig> plots
we revisited the extent of variation of gc <dig> found in various species. in figure  <dig> we have plotted the distributions of gc <dig> for  <dig> plant and animal species. distributions of gc <dig> in h. sapiens, o. sativa, c. reinhardtii, and z. mays are clearly bi-modal, a. cepa, a. thaliana, g. max, s. cerevisiae and c. elegans are unimodal, and b. napus, d. rerio and m. musculus have intermediate distributions. uni- and bi-modality of gc <dig> distributions in various organisms have been reported previously  <cit>  and our results are consistent with the earlier observations on the species tested.

isochores may not explain the presence of gc3-rich genes in grasses
previous reports on gc3-rich genes have suggested that these are present in gc-rich regions of the genome, aka isochores  <cit> . the authors suggested that gc <dig> bimodality in grasses came about because these genes are located in regions of their respective genomes that differ in g+c content. two decades of full genome sequencing and annotation of numerous plant genomes make it worthwhile to revisit the issue of codon usage in plants and plant isochore organization. in order to answer the question of isochores in grasses, we analyzed the gc contents of coding and non-coding sequences in o. sativa. overall, the correlation of gc <dig> values between adjacent genes is  <dig> , indicating that there is no significant clustering of these genes. we separated all mrna-validated rice genes into two groups on the basis of gc <dig> content: the "low" group, where gc3< <dig> , contains  <dig>  genes; and the "high" group, where gc <dig> ≥  <dig> , contains  <dig>  genes. the choice of cut-off point between the two groups was based on the position of the lowest gc <dig> value between the two peaks. . we analyzed the spatial distribution of genes with high gc <dig> values. of the  <dig>  genes in the high group,  <dig>  are evenly distributed across the genome;  <dig> genes  occur in  <dig> clumps of  <dig> or more genes . five of these clumps are likely to result from relatively recent gene duplication, since they consist of genes with identical pfam annotations. from the analysis of seven animal species, elhaik et al.  <cit>  inferred that gc <dig> can only explain a very small proportion of the variation in gc content of long genomic sequences flanking the genes, and correlations between gc <dig> and gc in the flanking region decayed rapidly with distance from the gene. accordingly, we examined  <dig>  nucleotides upstream of the  <dig>  rice genes and also found no significant correlation in gc content between the open reading frames and flanking regions. the gc contents of the high and low groups gave nearly identical unimodal bell-shaped frequency distributions centered at gc =  <dig> . these results suggest an absence of isochore organization in the rice genome and indicate that the high-gc <dig> genes are not closely associated with gc-rich regions in rice.

gc <dig> correlates with variability of gene expression
previous reports have concluded that high-gc <dig> genes are associated with highly expressed transcripts  <cit> . we revisited this observation in rice by examining the expression levels of o. sativa genes. in order to dissect the pattern, we computed gc <dig> and the standard deviations of expression levels for  <dig>  o. sativa genes across  <dig> series of gene expression measurements . the standard deviations of gene expression and gc <dig> values were converted to standardized z-scores and plotted . there is a strong positive correlation between the two measures: if we group genes by gc <dig> and compute the average z-score of standard deviation of expression for each group, the relationship can be interpolated using the linear regression equation y =  <dig> x +  <dig> , r <dig> =  <dig> . this shows that genes with higher values of gc <dig> have more variable expression profiles than genes with low gc <dig> values. we also plotted gc <dig> as a function of gene expression . the relationship between average gene expression and gc <dig> is not as straightforward as between gc <dig> and variability of expression. it appears that for the majority  of genes with expression z-scores between - <dig> and  <dig>  average expression level and gc <dig> are negatively correlated; for a subset of strongly expressed genes , the relationship is positive; genes that are weakly expressed  tend to have high gc <dig> and show no significant correlation between gc <dig> and expression. this observation may explain why conflicting results have been reported: weak, positive or negative correlations between codon usage and expression level  <cit> . the observed saddle-like pattern  and the linear relationship between standard deviation of gene expression and gc <dig>  may indicate the presence of distinct functional classes of genes in which the two quantities are differently related to each other. the discovery of relationships between expression levels and gc <dig> motivated us to analyze the promoters of well-annotated o. sativa genes.

gc <dig> correlates with the presence of an upstream tata box
for decades, it was believed that genes whose promoters contain tata boxes  are more highly expressed than those that do not   <cit> . yang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that tata- genes are frequently involved in "houskeeping" activities in the cell while tata+ genes are often highly regulated by biotic or stress stimuli. in  <dig>  moshonov et al.  <cit>  reported that tata+ genes are generally shorter than tata- genes, and gene expression is influenced by a combination of core promoter type, presence of introns and gene size. it was recently shown by troukhan et al.  <cit>  that tata+ promoters belong to genes with higher standard deviations of microarray intensity than tata- promoters. additionally, a saddle-like pattern similar to that in figure 2b was observed when the frequency of tata-boxes was plotted as a function of expression level. we have previously demonstrated  <cit>  that different go categories have different frequencies of tata+ genes. for example, almost 60% of oxidative stress-related genes have tata boxes, in sharp contrast to 20% of protein folding-related genes. since expression variability and gene class appear to be correlated with codon usage, we decided to "complete the triangle" and calculate the frequency of tata boxes in relation to the gc <dig> levels of genes. approximately 30% of rice promoters in osiris database contain a canonical tata-box in the  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. only 18% of rice genes with gc <dig> <  <dig>  are equipped with tata+ promoters as compared to 52% of those with gc <dig> >  <dig>  . we hypothesize that the presence of tata in the promoter establishes a conformational framework for transcription factors that facilitates reliable and timely transcription initiation. therefore, stress-response genes tend to have a higher frequency of tata-boxes. an additional gc pair makes translation more efficient and better coordinated with transcription  <cit> . a stress-related protein has to be produced quickly and reliably at the onset of a stress condition. therefore, insertion of a tata box in the promoter sequence and elevated gc <dig> frequency ensure rapid production without altering the amino acid sequence.

number of expressed paralogs and orthologs is negatively associated with gc3
using the same logic, it is easy to explain why the number of gene paralogs is negatively correlated with gc <dig> . if a genome has multiple copies of a gene , any one of these copies may be transcribed and translated to obtain the required protein. on the other hand, unique copies of genes have to be optimized transcriptionally and translationally to ensure protein production. these ideas were first formulated almost a decade ago, when hooper et al.  <cit>  suggested that there is positive selection on codons that are translated more efficiently, either more quickly or more accurately. similarly, considering the specificity of a gene in an organism, highly species-specific genes  tend to possess high gc3: 44% of o. sativa-specific genes have gc <dig> ≥  <dig>  as compared to 29% for all genes. this is consistent with the assumption that equilibrium is reached at the high at end of the spectrum, and unless there is evolutionary pressure to maintain high gc content, a gene will become at-rich. the requirement for protein sequence conservation explains why the effect is most pronounced at the third position of a codon. we have to point out that our earlier observation  <cit> , that horizontal gene transfer may explain gc <dig> richness in a certain fraction of grass genes, is not applicable to all genes in the high-gc <dig> class. we found that among the expressed genes  in rice, 46% of those in the high-gc <dig> class have orthologs in a. thaliana, as compared to 60% of the low-gc <dig> genes. however, if we consider all rice genes regardless of expression level , we find that 65% of the high-gc <dig> class and 57% of the low-gc <dig> class have orthologs in a. thaliana. this means that gc <dig> content affects the expression pattern. many high-gc <dig> genes with homologs in arabidopsis are not expressed in rice, probably because they have been silenced by methylation and will be activated only under extremely rare stress conditions.

gc <dig> is negatively correlated with gene length and intron density
genes in the middle of the gc <dig> spectrum  have a negative correlation with orf length , whereas for genes in the high gc <dig> class and for those with gc3< <dig> , it is approximately  <dig>  as was previously observed  <cit> , variability of gene expression is negatively correlated with intron density. we computed pearson's correlation coefficient between gc <dig> and intron density for o. sativa and s. bicolor: for both grass species it is approximately - <dig>  . genes with high gc <dig> tend to be mono-exonic  <cit> . this is consistent with our observation of a positive relationship between gene expression variability and gc <dig>  on the basis of this evidence, we suggest that rapidly evolving genes are shorter, have more variable expression and are gc3-rich. more "evolutionarily stable" genes tend to accumulate introns and increase the orf length.

gradient of codon usage along the gene
analysis of coding sequences in several organisms has indicated a gradient in codon usage from the 5' to 3' ends of genes  <cit> . based on analysis of e. coli genes, hooper et al.  <cit>  suggested that g3-containing codons may be translated with lower error rate and more quickly than other codons, thus avoiding congestion of ribosomes owing to a gradual increase of speed of translation along the gene. according to wong et al.  <cit> , o. sativa genes are richer in gc at the 5' end than at the 3' end. a. thaliana shows no such trend in gc usage. lescot et al.  <cit>  reported that there are two distinct classes of genes in the musa acuminata  genome: those with arabidopsis-like and those with rice-like gradients. m. acuminata is a monocot plant that belongs to the same order of commelinids as poaceae. analysis of gc <dig> distribution in the members of the zingiberales order, banana, ginger and turmeric, indicates the possibility of bimodality . unfortunately, the number of currently sequenced cdss for the zingiberales order is too small for conclusive statistical analysis. for o. sativa genes from the high and low gc <dig> classes, we computed the  and found that genes in the high-gc <dig> class have a slight preference for c <dig>  and the low-gc <dig> class have a slight preference for g <dig>  the overall correlation coefficient between gc <dig> skew and gc <dig> content is approximately  <dig> . we plotted gc <dig> skew as a function of the number of codons from atg . genes from the high-gc <dig> peak in rice, sorghum and, probably, banana have a preference for c <dig> over g <dig>  this preference initially increases from 5' to 3' and then peaks and levels off at cg <dig> skew ≈  <dig> . genes in the low-gc <dig> class have a similar tendency in the first  <dig> or so codons but then show a strong preference for g <dig> over c <dig>  cg <dig> skew ≈ - <dig> . since the low-gc <dig> class is approximately twice as abundant, when genes from the high- and low-gc <dig> classes are considered together, the prevailing tendency is for gc to decrease toward the 3' end, as observed by lescot et al.  <cit> . if the translation efficiency explanation for genes  <cit>  carries over to eukaryotes, genes with positive gc <dig> skew have more g <dig> in mrna and therefore more optimal codons. following this explanation, we hypothesize that genes in the high-gc <dig> class must be more important for the well-being of an organism than genes from the low-gc <dig> class.

codon usage and gene classes

the first two nucleotides in a codon are more reflective of gene function than the third one. using coding sequences of o. sativa, we computed average gc <dig> and gc <dig> for go and fpam annotations. the coefficient of variation for gc <dig> is approximately three times smaller than the coefficient of variation for gc <dig>  however, the third position in the codon also affects gene function. liu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that synonymous codon usage and gene function are strongly correlated in o. sativa; they found that genes involved in metabolic processes have a preference for c or g in the third position of a codon. different pfam families show affinity for high- or low-gc <dig> classes. for example, o. sativa genes annotated as "expressed proteins" are more prevalent in the low class  and alpha-expansins are more prevalent in the high group . details are given in the supplementary data . it appears that gc <dig> increase tends to co-evolve in some pfam families of grass genes across multiple organisms. the distribution of gc <dig> in histone, ribosomal and chrolophyll a-b binding protein coding genes are very similar for rice and corn. in both organisms, 80% of chrolophyll a-b binding proteins have gc3> <dig> , ribosomal proteins are approximately normally distributed around gc <dig> =  <dig> , and 60% of all histones have gc3> <dig> . another way to look at the relationship between gene category and gc <dig> is by considering go annotation . d. rerio, m. musculus, h. sapiens, c. reinhardtii, o. sativa and z. mays have higher gc <dig> values than a. thaliana and we were curious to see if gc <dig> is consistent between these organisms and go categories. the high-gc <dig> species also have consistently higher gc <dig> values for genes from the following go classes: electron transport or energy pathways, response to abiotic or biotic stimuli, response to stress, transcription and signal transduction. therefore, we conclude that certain classes of genes are characterized by high gc <dig> values across kingdoms.

gc <dig> in cds and gc genomic context are not correlated
using the genome of o. sativa, we computed the probability of a rice gene belonging to the high-gc <dig> peak on the basis of the gc content of its promoter, coding gc <dig> and introns . the msu collection of rice upstream sequences contained  <dig>  1-kb long sequences, of which we retained  <dig>  corresponding to our curated set of orfs. msu's collection of introns contained  <dig>  sequences. we eliminated introns containing blast hits to o. sativa ests. the resulting set contained  <dig>  loci with introns. the dividing line between high and low gc <dig> was set at  <dig> . we observed that of these three gene parts, the gc content of introns seems to have the most striking effect on gc <dig> content in coding regions. the reduced influence of gc <dig> can be explained by constraints imposed by protein sequence conservation. there is also no dependency between gc <dig> and the gc content of  <dig> nucleotides taken from the 3' flanking region . introns are generally at-rich, with only a small fraction having high gc values. to test the statistical significance of this effect, we used our curated set of  <dig>  genes that have introns and performed a chi-squared test. the resulting p-value was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  so the effect is highly significant. similar results were obtained for another grass, s. bicolor . the sharp increase in probability of being in the high-gc <dig> class for genes with gc-rich introns suggests that the appearance of high-gc <dig> genes in grasses is unlikely to be linked to a translational mechanism.

high-gc <dig> genes have more targets for methylation
kalisz and purugganan  <cit>  proposed that gc content may affect gene transcription. they observed that naturally-occurring variations of gene methylation  can influence the level of gene expression and produce novel phenotypes. the authors found that methylated epialleles in plants are associated with organ specificity and stress response. salinas et al.  <cit>  reported that gc-rich genes provide more targets for methylation. the estimates were made using 5mc quantification by hplc and methylation over available di- and tri-nucleotide targets of methyltransferases. a recent paper by stayssman et al.  <cit>  points out that housekeeping genes are not methylated and are therefore constantly available for transcription, whereas tissue-specific genes are methylated and generally inactivated. stayssman et al.  <cit>  observed a relatively large number of cpg islands that seem to be fully methylated in most cell types but unmethylated in a single tissue. these regions are initially unmethylated, and then they undergo de novo methylation in all somatic cells during development. methylation may be involved in repression of the genes in these islands. these observations are consistent with our findings that genes in the high-gc <dig> peak tend to have a higher frequency of methylatable cg dinucleotides  and are more differentially expressed under various stresses, among tissue types and among developmental stages. in order to illustrate this fact better, we selected  <dig>  genes from the high-gc <dig> peak in rice and compared them to  <dig>  genes with the lowest gc <dig> contents. for these genes, we computed cg and gc frequencies in cdss . apparently, a high-gc <dig> peak is characterized by an increased preference for cg over gc and a low-gc <dig> class favors gc over cg . we suggest that a regulatory mechanism acts differentially on high- and low-gc <dig> genes. one may wonder whether these pronounced differences are purely statistical rather than biological, as dinucleotide frequencies depend on overall nucleotide composition. therefore, we examined the differences using relative abundance values  that account for background nucleotide distribution. additional analysis was needed to establish the extent of this effect. we computed di- and tri-nucleotide frequencies and relative abundance values  for coding regions of a. thaliana, s. bicolor and o. sativa. frequencies and relative abundance values of cg in rice and sorghum have bimodal distributions, while tri-nucleotide frequencies and relative abundance values are unimodal. although the frequencies of trinucleotides of the type cwg, where w stands for a or t, differ among the organisms studied, the distribution of relative abundance of cwg is nearly identical for s. bicolor, o. sativa and a. thaliana.

the bimodality of genome signature distribution indicates the presence of hidden covariates. tran et al.  <cit>  reported that cytosine dna methylation in plants is found predominantly in transposable elements and repetitive dna, where methylcytosines are typically found in cg and cwg. methylation of cg and cwg sites is maintained by different mechanisms: cg sites are maintained by a plant homolog of mammalian dnmt <dig> acting on hemi-methylated dna after replication  <cit>  whereas methylation of cng sites  is maintained by other mechanisms. methylation of cs that are followed by gs is a regulatory strategy employed by some eukaryotes  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the high-gc <dig> class has a significantly greater proportion of the dinucleotide cg than the low-gc <dig> class and that there is no significant difference in the relative abundance of cwg between the two classes of genes. since there is evolutionary pressure to keep the first and second nucleotides in the codon intact, we analyzed position-specific genomic signatures ρc3g <dig> and ρc2g <dig>  and position-specific frequencies of nucleotides in the third position, conditional on having cytosine in the second position. for the high-gc <dig> class of genes there is a slight preference for g in the third position: p/p =  <dig> . for the low-gc <dig> genes, there is a more pronounced difference between conditional probabilities, and the cg combination was the least favored for rice: p/p =  <dig> . another possibility for obtaining cg dinucleotides without altering the amino acid sequence is to place c in the third position of a codon that is immediately followed by a codon starting with guanine. genes from the low gc3-peak have cytosine in the third position of the previous codon less frequently than high gc <dig> genes. for the high-gc <dig> genes, there is a preference for c in the third position: p/p =  <dig> . for the low gc <dig> genes, there is an opposite trend: p/p =  <dig> . a similar pattern was found when we examined sequences of s. bicolor. for comparison, we computed position-specific enrichments for a. thaliana. since gc <dig> has a unimodal distribution, we observe no significant differences between high-gc <dig> and low-gc <dig> genes in arabidopsis .

we analyzed protein families containing genes of o. sativa that are either enriched in cg and depleted in cwg or enriched in cwg and depleted in cg. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of position-specific relative abundance for αβ-hydrolase- <dig> proteins of o. sativa; αβ-hydrolase- <dig> represents a family of proteins that is enriched in cg and depleted in cwg. on the other side of the enrichment spectrum are genes containing heat repeats ; they are depleted in cg and the relative tri-nucleotide abundance is ~ <dig>  these proteins function as protein-protein interaction surfaces; many heat repeat-containing proteins are involved in intracellular transport processes. protein kinases  participate in many processes such as cell division, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. this diversity may explain the wide bimodal distribution of dinucleotide abundance values for protein kinases. in analyzing the relative abundances of the dinucleotide cg in o. sativa and s. bicolor we noticed that different gene ontology categories and protein families have preferences for certain nucleotide compositions, and these preferences are consistent between the two organisms. conservation is higher for certain gene categories than for others: for example, genes that belong to the "transcription regulation activity" go function category have a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  between rice and sorghum, and  <dig>  between rice and arabidopsis. genes that have "motor activity" function have a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  between rice and sorghum, and  <dig>  between rice and arabidopsis. these observations support the earlier suggestion of pradhan et al.  <cit>  that the action and control of cg and cwg methyltransferases might be different and that cg and cwg methylation may serve different biological functions.

high-gc <dig> genes and gc-biased gene conversion
many previous studies have demonstrated a significant association between gc <dig> and recombination rate across different plant and animal species  <cit> . the conclusion is that high gc <dig> content in an organism indicates a recombining genome. similarly, the presence of two distinct gc classes of genes may suggest the existence of recombining and non-recombining regions within that genome. to support this hypothesis, we computed the mutation rates of rice genes . for our curated dataset of  <dig> k rice genes, we found a positive correlation between the density of snps per  <dig> nucleotides and gc <dig> . association with overall gc content is much weaker, r <dig> =  <dig> . therefore, we conclude that high-gc <dig> genes accumulate more mutations and are located in the highly recombining regions of the rice genome.

importance of gc3
analysis of gene-specific codon usage bias shows that gc <dig> is the major characteristic of codon utilization in poaceae. in order to demonstrate this, we used principal component analysis  to find a basis for the space of codon vectors. approximately 50% of the variance in codon usage is explained by the first principal component; this component has an almost perfect negative correlation  with gc <dig>  the remaining components contribute at most 4% each to the variance; the second principal component is weakly correlated to gc <dig> skew.

discussion
deviations from unimodal bell-shaped distributions of gc <dig> appear in many species, but grasses have very pronounced bimodal distributions . bimodality in warm-blooded vertebrates can be explained by the presence of isochores. although there are many similarities between genes in high-gc human isochores and high-gc <dig> genes in grasses, the isochore hypothesis does not fully explain the existence of high-gc <dig> genes in grasses: first, there is no correlation between orfs and the flanking regions; second, most species with isochores do not have a high-gc <dig> peak. possible causes of bimodality may be elucidated by comparing genes in the high- and low-gc <dig> classes. these classes differ in nucleotide composition and composition gradients along coding regions. high-gc <dig> class genes have a significantly higher frequency of cg dinucleotides ; therefore, there is an additional regulatory mechanism for high-gc <dig> genes. springer et al.  <cit>  reported that out of eight classes of methyl-cpg-binding domain proteins present in dicots, only six exist in monocots, suggesting a difference between dicots and monocots in silencing of methylated genes.

two competing processes may affect the frequency of methylation targets: the gc-based mismatch repair mechanism and at-biased mutational pressure. in recombining organisms , the gc content of coding and regulatory regions is enhanced because of the action of the gc-based mismatch repair mechanism; this effect is especially pronounced for gc <dig>  <cit> . recombination has been shown to be a driving force for the increase in gc <dig> in many organisms  <cit> . repair  happens all over the genome with a certain precision, leading to an increase in gc. if repair did not occur in defence-related genes, the organism may fail to survive or to reproduce. if repair did not happen in less important genes , it may not be detrimental to the organism. at-biased mutational pressure, resulting from cytosine deamination  <cit>  or oxidative damage to c and g bases  <cit> , counteracts the influence of recombination; and in most asexually-reproducing species and self-pollinating plants, at bias is the winning process. our analysis from aligning indica and japonica, as well as earlier publications  <cit> , indicate that genomic regions under higher selective pressure are more frequently recombining and therefore increase their gc <dig> content. this mechanism may explain the pronounced differences in gc <dig> between a. thaliana and its closest relatives. comparison of the nucleotide compositions of coding regions in a. thaliana, r. sativus, b. rapa, and b. napus reveals that the gc <dig> values of r. sativus, b. rapa, and b. napus genes are on average  <dig>  higher than those of the corresponding a. thaliana orthologs  <cit> . an important difference between a. thaliana and brassica and raphanus is that the latter two genera are self-incompatible, whereas a. thaliana is self-pollinating. self-pollination in arabidopsis keeps its recombination rates low and thus reduces the gc <dig> content of its genes. self-pollination is also reported in some grasses such as wheat, barley and oats. analysis of recombination in wheat  <cit>  showed that the genome contains areas of high and low recombination. grasses have an efficient reproductive mechanism and high genetic variability that enables them to adapt to different climates and soil types  <cit> . we hypothesize that since self-pollination generally lowers recombination rates, evolutionary pressure will selectively maintain high recombination rates for some genes. analysis of highly recombinogenic genomic regions of wheat, barley, maize and oat identified several genes of agronomic importance in these regions   <cit> . in addition to the methylation-driven growth of high-gc <dig>  we hypothesize that developing gc <dig> richness in some genes may, if it is not balanced by at-bias, work as a feed-forward mechanism. once it appears in genes under selective pressure, it provides additional transcriptional advantage. gc pairs differ from at pairs since guanine binds to cytosine with three hydrogen bonds, while adenine forms only two bonds with thymine. this additional hydrogen bond makes gc pairs more stable and gc-rich genes will have different biochemical properties from at-rich genes. when an at pair is replaced by a gc pair in the third position of a codon, the protein sequence remains unchanged but an additional hydrogen bond is introduced. this additional bond can make transcription more efficient and reliable, change the array of rna binding proteins, or significantly alter the three-dimensional folding of the messenger rna. in this case, those plant species that thrive and adapt successfully to harsh environments demonstrate a strong preference for gc <dig> in the third position of the codon.

high gc <dig> content provides more targets for methylation. the correlation between methylation and gc <dig> is supported by stayssman et al.  <cit> , who reported a positive correlation between methylation of internal unmethylated regions and expression of the host gene. in this paper we have demonstrated a positive correlation between gc <dig> and variability of gene expression; we also found that high-gc <dig> genes are more enriched in cg than the low-gc <dig> class. therefore, gc <dig> classes provide more targets for de novo methylation, which can serve as an additional mechanism of transcriptional regulation and affect the variability of gene expression. additional transcriptional regulation makes species more adaptable to external stresses.

grasses have undergone several genome duplications. genomic regions varied in their recombination rates and gc <dig> contents. since high gc <dig> content in a gene provided an evolutionary advantage, this was frequently the sole copy retained in grasses. this may explain why genes in the high-gc <dig> class frequently lack paralogs. high-gc <dig> genes provide an evolutionary advantage owing to their optimized codon usage and to the existence of methylation targets allowing for an additional mechanism of transcriptional regulation. therefore, the high-gc <dig> class of genes has been maintained in grasses for generations.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we combine a variety of prior observations and insights on gc <dig> biology with new observations using larger genome data sets to establish a unifying framework of hypotheses to explain all the available data fully. this framework consists of evolutionary forces and sexual reproduction patterns to justify a wide variety of observed codon usage patterns in plants and animals. these evolutionary forces are realized through introducing new mutations during meiotic recombination and fixation with the help of dna methylation and transcriptional mechanisms. the presence of gc3-rich genes is not likely to be a consequence of chromosomal isochores or horizontal gene transfer. regardless of their initial origin, high-gc <dig> genes in recombining species possessed a self-maintaining mechanism that over time could only increase their drift towards even higher gc <dig> values. this uncompensated drift may explain the pronounced bimodality of some rapidly-evolving species. competing forces acting in grasses make gc <dig> distribution distinctly bimodal; genes in the high-gc <dig> class are more transcriptionally regulated, provide more targets for methylation and accumulate more mutations than genes in the low-gc <dig> class.
