BACKGROUND
the mosquito, aedes aegypti, is the principal global vector for the yellow fever and dengue viruses, and also one of the best genetically characterized insects  <cit> . of african origin, ae. aegypti has successfully colonized most sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world, largely as a consequence of human activities. this mosquito has been and remains the most commonly studied mosquito species, particularly for genetic analyses of disease vector/pathogen interactions because it breeds in small water-holding containers, its eggs are resistant to desiccation and persist in a pre-embryonated state, and it readily adapts to laboratory culture. detailed genetic studies have emerged from linkage maps for ae. aegypti generated from isozyme and mutant marker loci  <cit> , rapds  <cit> , rflps  <cit> , and sscps  <cit> . demonstration that rflp markers based on cdnas had inter-specific utility  <cit>  facilitated development of comparative linkage maps for several mosquito species  <cit> .

microsatellites are simple sequence repeats of tandem 1- <dig> base motifs that are frequently distributed throughout eukaryote genomes. because repeat number at individual loci can vary among individuals and polymorphisms can efficiently be uncovered using pcr, microsatellites have become powerful tools for genetic studies in many organisms  <cit> . of interest, useful microsatellite loci in some organisms including ae. aegypti are not abundant or are recalcitrant to common methods of identification. in ae. aegypti, these include microsatellite enriched genomic library construction and screening  <cit> , examinations of expressed gene coding sequences  <cit> , and oligonucleotide-based screening of select cosmid genomic clones  <cit> . disappointingly, the combined efforts of these studies resulted in only  <dig> useful microsatellite marker loci, several of which showed reduced polymorphism. these results were most likely due to their close association with repetitive elements as opposed to microsatellite frequency in the ae. aegypti genome  <cit> . availability of a partial ae. aegypti genome sequence in  <dig> provided the opportunity to perform genome scans for microsatellites and, indeed, an additional  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites were uncovered  <cit> .

here we present a systematic approach to efficient polymorphic microsatellite marker development in ae. aegypti based on intensive scans of supercontig assemblies from the whole genome shotgun sequence  assembly for ae. aegypti  <cit> . in addition, we identified multiplex combinations of microsatellite loci that facilitate rapid genome-wide genotyping and demonstrate the utility of these microsatellite loci in a preliminary investigation of ae. aegypti population genetic structure in haiti.

RESULTS
microsatellite identification, assays and utility
tandem repeats finder   <cit>  was used to systematically screen  <dig> wgs supercontig sequence assemblies in the ae. aegypti genome for polymorphic single copy microsatellites . the supercontigs were selected on the basis of containing previously characterized genetic marker loci distributed across all three ae. aegypti chromosomes  <cit> . of  <dig> putative microsatellite loci tested, we determined that  <dig> amplified as single copy sequences in all or some of the four mosquito lab strains tested, of which  <dig> were found to be polymorphic across the four strains with a range of 2- <dig> alleles per locus . these included  <dig> loci on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> loci on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> loci on chromosome  <dig>  of the remaining  <dig> putative loci,  <dig> were determined to represent multicopy sequences and four sequences failed to amplify. in addition, four supercontigs contained no useful microsatellites based on our selection criteria. chromosome locations for supercontigs and associated microsatellites were assigned based on the linkage map positions of the previously defined genetic loci. an additional  <dig> putative microsatellite loci amplified as multiple copies. no microsatellite sequences were evident in four supercontigs. thus, direct scans of ae. aegypti supercontigs provided a rapid and efficient mechanism for developing useful microsatellite loci and also the opportunity to leverage existing information on supercontig genome positions relative to the existing genetic linkage map. when coupled with the previously described  <dig> microsatellite loci  <cit> , this effort has doubled the number of available polymorphic loci.

we tested microsatellites representing  <dig> motifs ; these included one single nucleotide , five di-nucleotide ,  <dig> tri-nucleotide , six tetra-nucleotide , and one hexa-nucleotide  motifs . the single-copy polymorphic microsatellites comprise  <dig> independent motifs, of which  <dig> were tri-nucleotide motifs and these represented the majority  of the polymorphic single copy loci. of particular note, 51%  of the tri-nucleotide and 67%  of the tetra-nucleotide microsatellites were polymorphic single copy loci, while only 33%  of the di-nucleotide microsatellites were polymorphic single copy loci. although a small number of polymorphic tri-nucleotide microsatellite loci contained within coding regions have been identified in previous studies  <cit> , blast analyses against the annotated ae. aegypti genome assembly at vectorbase  <cit>  indicated that none of our polymorphic tri-nucleotide microsatellites were within putative coding regions.

to improve the utility and efficiency of microsatellites for genotyping applications in ae. aegypti, we developed seven groups of 4- <dig> loci each for multiplex-ready pcr  <cit>  . individual loci in each group were selected to provide broad genome representation and relatively uniform amplification under the same pcr conditions when multiplexed. pcr groups 1a and 4a represent slight variants on groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively: most of the loci are common among the respective groups with some inter-change of microsatellite loci that provide for potential diversity of chromosome coverage but still amplify well as multiplex pcr groups. primers were designed to generate amplicons from ~150- <dig> bp and were fluorescently labeled for analysis by capillary electrophoresis. we included four microsatellite loci described elsewhere  <cit>  in some of the groups. however, in conjunction with optimizing amplicon sizes for multiplex-ready pcr, we designed at least one new primer for each of these loci .

genetic patterns of aedes aegypti populations in haiti
we used multiplex-ready pcr groups  <dig>  1b,  <dig>  3a and  <dig> to conduct investigations of seven ae. aegypti populations sampled in haiti during june  <dig>  pcr groups 1a and 4a as variants on groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were not included in our assays of samples from haiti. of the  <dig> microsatellite loci represented in these groups,  <dig> were polymorphic with a range of  <dig> to  <dig> alleles per locus with a mean of  <dig>  alleles per locus among a total of  <dig> individuals across the seven sample sites . further, for  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic loci, at least  <dig> alleles were segregating among the populations. allelic polymorphic information content  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  across loci with a mean pic =  <dig>  , indicating that a large proportion of these loci are highly informative for population studies. thus, these multiplex-ready pcr groups represent an efficient option for rapidly screening individual mosquitoes in 96-well microplate format. our genotype analyses of mosquito collections from haiti with the selected multiplex-ready pcr groups indicated that these microsatellite loci exhibited higher levels of polymorphism compared with previous microsatellite data reported for ae. aegypti field populations in c√¥te d'ivoire, kenya and vietnam, respectively  <cit> .

the observed heterozygosity was generally high among all loci and across the seven populations, with notable exceptions at three loci . the 301ct <dig>  328ctt <dig>  and 145taaa <dig> loci each showed very low, and in several populations, no heterozygosity. while we have no explanation for this phenomenon, it is interesting to note that each of these loci is located at or near the end of a linkage group; the associated supercontigs contain the genetic loci lf <dig>  lf <dig>  and aegi <dig>  respectively  <cit> . however, after excluding these three loci, most loci met hardy-weinberg  expectations, with the exception of the port au prince population where seven of the remaining  <dig> loci showed significant hw deviations. the observed hw deviations across all populations were due to heterozygote deficits.

significant population differentiation was observed with  <dig> of  <dig>  pairwise fst comparisons . the mean pairwise fst across the  <dig> polymorphic loci ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . port au prince showed significant differentiation with four of the other six populations, while the la poudriere population showed no differentiation with any of the other populations. to test for isolation by distance, we regressed the pairwise fst/ against the natural logarithm of the distance between sites . we found no association between them . that is, while distances between sites varied from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  km, the observed levels of genetic differentiation between sites were sometimes high and sometimes low irrespective of distance. this result is typical for ae. aegypti populations as adults generally travel very short distances from breeding sites in a lifetime, often ~ <dig> m or less, with some evidence for greater but still modest dispersal   <cit> . longer range dispersal and population differentiation are more likely to reflect the effects of mosquito transport via human activities than relative distances among breeding sites and active dispersal by individual mosquitoes.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the ae. aegypti genome is well-populated with microsatellite loci suitable for genotyping and outline an efficient strategy for identifying and validating microsatellites from genome supercontig assemblies. while multiple repeat motifs were evident and represented as single copy sequences, tri-nucleotide microsatellites were the most common, and with tetra-nucleotide microsatellites, the most applicable to development as genetic loci. we developed several multiplex-ready pcr groups of microsatellite loci that permit rapid genotyping, and demonstrate their utility with ae. aegypti population samples from haiti. we observed high polymorphism with a mean of  <dig>  alleles per locus, high allelic polymorphic information content , and evidence for population differentiation even across relatively short geographic distances as is often reported for ae. aegypti.
