BACKGROUND
the saprophytic ascomycete hypocrea jecorina  is well known as an industrial producer of cellulases. its potential for secretion of high levels of cellulolytic enzymes has lead to a widespread application of the fungus in processes related to pulp and paper or textile industry  <cit> . cellulase gene expression is inducer dependent and cellulose, lactose, sophorose and sorbitol have all been identified as carbon sources promoting cellulase gene expression. conversely, glucose inhibits inducer uptake, while in the presence of glycerol induction of cellulase gene expression is still possible. the basal level of cellulase gene expression is carbon catabolite repressed on carbon sources allowing fast metabolism   <cit> . several transacting proteins mediating this induction have been identified, including both activators , activator of cellulase expression  <dig> , heme activation protein  complex) as well as repressors )  <cit> . the exact mechanisms involved in the cellulose to cellulase signal transduction network, however, remain poorly understood.

recently, a connection between light response and carbon source signaling was discovered. one important factor in the respective regulatory mechanism was shown to be the pas/lov domain  domain of the light, oxygen and voltage type) protein envoy  <cit> . envoy not only regulates h. jecorina light response but also influences carbon source signaling and impacts light-dependent regulation of numerous genes in various ways  <cit> . the function of envoy, with respect to cellulase expression, is both light and inducer-dependent, thus interlinking the two pathways. this connection led us to include light related signaling phenomena in our experiments in conjunction with cellulase gene expression and to investigate transcription under strictly controlled light conditions. in the following we could further show that the g-protein α subunit gna <dig> is involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression in light  <cit> . the significant regulatory impact of constitutive activation of gna <dig> on cellulase gene expression  suggests the transmission of an important signal. nevertheless, the fact that constitutive activation of gna <dig> does not lead to inducer independent cellulase formation rules out that gna <dig> transmits the crucial signal for the presence of cellulose.

signal transduction via heterotrimeric g-proteins has been studied in numerous fungi and is now recognized as one of the most important signaling pathways. this pathway regulates fundamental biological functions such as growth and conidiation, sexual development, virulence, tolerance against various forms of stress and secondary metabolite production  <cit> . in recent years, g-protein α subunits have been cloned and characterized from a wide array of fungi  <cit> , demonstrating considerable conservation of these proteins. although it might thus be concluded that their function in important physiological processes should also be similar, very different phenotypic consequences were shown as a result of disrupting genes encoding these highly conserved fungal g-protein subunits. for example, despite high similarity at the amino acid level between cryphonectria parasitica cpg- <dig> and neurospora crassa gna- <dig>  deletion of cpg- <dig> abolished asexual sporulation  <cit> , while deletion of gna- <dig> did not influence conidiation  <cit> . therefore, the specific role of a given gα subunit can hardly be predicted by extrapolating results obtained with another species, especially if the natural habitats and lifestyles are different. however, most of the work available on heterotrimeric g-protein signaling was not performed under controlled light conditions. the fact that we found considerable differences between results upon growth in light as compared to darkness for the regulatory role of gna <dig>   <cit> , indicates that this environmental cue is of crucial importance for signal transduction through this pathway in fungi.

gα protein subunits can be classified into three major subgroups according to their similarity to mammalian orthologs: subgroup i, which inhibits adenylate cyclase and which is related to the mammalian gαi-proteins; subgroup ii, which has no homology with mammalian g-proteins; and subgroup iii, which reportedly activates adenylate cyclase in most fungi and is related to mammalian gαs-proteins  <cit> . nevertheless there are also exceptions to that classification  <cit> .

both deletion as well as constitutive activation of gα subunits are considered to result in increased abundance of free gβ and γ subunits. opposite effects of such strains, as would be expected, represent a function of the respective gα subunit, whereas similar phenotypic traits caused by deletion or constitutive activation of a gα subunit are interpreted as an indication for regulation by the gβγ-proteins  <cit> .

in this study we elucidate the roles of the h. jecorina subgroup i gα subunit gna <dig> in different physiological processes. some of the important functions of gna <dig> orthologs in other fungi are regulation of cellulase and hydrophobin gene expression in c. parasitica  <cit>  and involvement in stress response and biomass accumulation in n. crassa  <cit> . the genome of h. jecorina comprises three gα subunits  <cit> , one of which  has already been shown to be involved in light-dependent regulation of cellulase gene expression  <cit> , but does not transmit the specific cellulose signal. therefore, and because of the function of the c. parasitica gα subunit cpg- <dig> in cellulase gene expression  <cit> , we investigated whether the gα subunit gna <dig> would be responsible for this signal. we show that on cellulose, the gα subunit gna <dig> also has a light-dependent role in regulation of cellulase and hydrophobin gene transcription. moreover we found hints as to a carbon source-dependent feedback regulation of gna <dig> transcription upon activation of gna <dig>  although not a direct sensor for the presence of cellulose  gna <dig> plays an important role in transmission of a carbon source signal, which has different effects in light and darkness. besides these regulatory functions we also detected a role of gna <dig> in regulation of growth and stress tolerance.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of h. jecorina gna1
searching the t. reesei genome database v <dig>   <cit>  for proteins with high similarity to the c. parasitica gα subunit cpg- <dig>  which had been implicated in cellulase gene regulation  <cit> , revealed the presence of a single copy of a gene encoding a class i gα subunit, which consists of a predicted  <dig>  bp open reading frame. comparison of the cdna and genomic sequences confirmed three introns within the open reading frame as indicated in the genome database and revealed a further, particularly long intron in the 5' untranslated region . following the guidelines set for the annotation of the t. reesei genome, we named this gene gna <dig> according to the already characterized ortholog of n. crassa. the deduced amino acid sequence of h. jecorina gna <dig> corresponds to a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and contains a consensus site for n-myristoylation  in the n-terminal region  <cit>  as well as a consensus site for adp ribosylation by pertussis toxin  at the c-terminus  <cit>  hence characterizing gna <dig> as a typical member of the highly conserved class i g-protein α subgroup. the amino acid sequence of gna <dig> shows 99% identity to hypocrea atroviridis  tga <dig> . moreover, gna <dig> shows substantial similarity to gibberella zeae gba <dig> , c. parasitica cpc- <dig> , n. crassa gna- <dig>  and aspergillus fumigatus gpaa/fada .

within  <dig>  kb upstream of the gna <dig> translational start codon, which corresponds to an optimal kozak consensus  <cit> , several potential 5' upstream binding sites of transactivators are located: we found a gata box , a ccaat box  and  <dig> cre1-binding sites  in this genomic area. furthermore,  <dig> stress response elements ,  <cit>   <dig> of which were located within the large 5' untranslated region  intron, were detected. of these stress response elements the first two are also located within the intron found in the 5' utr. six motifs recognized by sry family hmg box dna binding motifs  5'-caaag-3'  were found in the respective region.

targeted deletion of gna1
in order to delineate the regulatory targets of gna <dig> signaling in h. jecorina, we first constructed a gna <dig> deletion strain by replacement of the coding region with the h. jecorina pyr <dig> gene conferring uridine prototrophy . the resulting knockout strains showed a decreased  and clearly delayed sporulation compared to wild type and the gna1-retransformed strain. cultivation of Δgna <dig> on malt extract agar plates or plates containing mandels-andreotti medium with 1%  carboxymethylcellulose, glucose, or lactose as carbon source revealed only minor differences in hyphal apical extension rates in constant light and darkness, but on glycerol a reduction to approximately 70% was observed. microscopic inspection of Δgna <dig> also did not show the significant morphological aberrations as reported for the respective n. crassa mutant strain  <cit>  such as hyperbranching or swellings in aerial hyphae . additionally, unlike in neurospora, we could not detect a positive influence of gna <dig> on intracellular camp levels  <cit>  in h. jecorina and hence adenylate cyclase activity, but we observed an increase of intracellular camp levels in the gna1-deletion mutant . this result corresponds well with data from the closely related h. atroviridis   <cit>  and from c. parasitica  <cit> , where deletion of the respective homologue also causes increased intracellular camp levels. this suggests that h. jecorina gna <dig> represents a typical member of the adenylate cyclase inhibiting class i of g-protein α subunits.

generation of h. jecorina recombinant strains expressing constitutively activated gna1
in order to create a h. jecorina strain which expresses a constitutively activated version of gna <dig>  a construct comprising the entire gna <dig> gene, but with the necessary alteration in the open reading frame was prepared. therefore, a point mutation was introduced into gna <dig>  facilitating expression of a constitutively activated mutant protein with a single amino acid change within the gtpase domain at position  <dig> . analogous mutations were previously reported to drastically reduce the intrinsic gtpase activity of gα subunits, and to prevent returning of the respective g-protein to the inactive state  <cit> . segers and nuss  <cit>  showed that these constitutively activated alleles are completely dominant over the wild-type allele in the case of ectopic integration. the gna1ql construct was used to transform the uridine auxotrophic h. jecorina strain tu- <dig>  constitutive activation caused a clear phenotype with delayed sporulation and reduced spore formation . in contrast to the gna1-deletion mutant, constitutive activation of gna <dig> did not significantly alter camp levels . nevertheless, transcription of the mutated allele has been confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  and subsequent sequencing of several random clones, which revealed the presence of the mutated sequence in addition to the wild type. although our results clearly indicate presence and transcription of the altered allele as well as effects of this mutation, we do not have proof of abolishment of gtpase activity. microscopic analysis as well as comparisons of the hyphal apical extension rates observed in mutant and wild-type strains on plates did not reveal severe morphological differences .

gna <dig> knockout impacts biomass formation
now having two strains with theoretically opposite characteristics with respect to gna <dig> activity in hand, we could investigate the physiological roles attributable to gna <dig>  and distinguish them from those processes influenced by the gβ and gγ subunit . because of the effect of deletion of gna <dig> on growth upon cultivation on agar plates on glycerol, biomass formation of Δgna <dig> and gna1ql was measured upon growth in liquid culture using mandels-andreotti medium supplemented with 1%  of glucose or glycerol as carbon source, respectively. upon growth in constant darkness, biomass accumulation of Δgna <dig> was considerably decreased compared to the wild-type strain on both glucose and glycerol. in light however, biomass accumulation of Δgna <dig> and gna1ql reached approximately equal levels, albeit they were significantly lower than in the wild-type strain . we conclude that gna <dig> is involved in regulation of growth of h. jecorina in liquid culture predominantly in darkness, since these growth effects are not observed upon growth on solid medium or in light. nevertheless, the major effect on growth seen in these experiments seems to be exerted via the influence of gna <dig> on the g-protein β and γ subunits, since both deletion as well as constitutive activation of a gα subunit cause increased levels of free gβ-proteins and γ-proteins and hence similar effects on a given process.

gna <dig> influences reaction to conditions of stress
previous studies on the gna <dig> orthologs n. crassa gna- <dig>  <cit>  and c. parasitica cpg- <dig>  <cit>  revealed that these gα subunits influence sensitivity to different kinds of stress. in n. crassa, deletion of gna- <dig> causes increased sensitivity to osmotic stress as compared to the wild type, while strains expressing a constitutively activated gna- <dig> did not show such a defect. in c. parasitica, in contrast, deletion of cpg- <dig> caused enhanced growth on hypertonic media, whereas the respective constitutively activated mutants showed less tolerance to osmotic stress. the presence of several stress elements in the promoter of h. jecorina gna <dig> suggests a role of gna <dig> in stress tolerance. however, contradicting effects in n. crassa and c. parasitica did not allow for prediction of the effect in h. jecorina. we therefore tested whether h. jecorina mutant strains deleted for gna <dig> or constitutive activation of gna <dig> would show any differences to the wild type when grown on 1% glucose as carbon source with or without  <dig> m nacl or  <dig> m sorbitol and with or without menadione, which causes oxidative stress. figure  <dig> shows growth of the mutant strains relative to the wild-type strains under different stress conditions. apical extension rate of the wild-type strain was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm/day in light or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm/day in darkness, respectively. the colony diameter of the wild type was decreased by  <dig> m nacl by 92% in light and by 69% in darkness. addition of  <dig> m sorbitol led to a reduction of radial growth by 46% in light and by 21% in darkness. menadione led to a reduction in colony diameter in the wild type by 57% in light and by 83% in darkness. the results reveal that gna <dig> only plays a minor role in tolerance of hyperosmotic conditions , but shows interesting effects in dealing with oxidative stress.

both the gna <dig> knockout as well as constitutive activation in most cases caused an increased inhibition by hyperosmotic conditions as compared to the wild type, albeit the variations are within standard deviations in some cases.

a different pattern was observed when these strains were analyzed for their response to oxidative stress . in darkness both deletion of gna <dig> and constitutive activation of gna <dig> caused enhanced growth in the presence of menadiaone as compared to the wild type. however, in light deletion of gna <dig> caused enhanced growth under conditions of oxidative stress, whereas constitutive activation of gna <dig> resulted in decreased growth under these conditions.

due to the similar direction of the effects caused by deletion or constitutive activation of gna <dig>  it appears that the βγ subunits are involved in the response to osmotic stress and that the  effect of gna <dig> is caused by its influence on these subunits. the gβ and γ subunits also seem to be largely responsible for the reaction to oxidative stress in darkness. however, in light the effect of gna <dig> is most likely executed without the participation of the gβ subunit.

transcription of gna <dig> is influenced by constitutive activation of its gene product
in order to determine the transcription characteristics of gna <dig> we analyzed wild-type and mutant strains on different carbon sources in darkness and after illumination. as the experiments described above indicated a light-dependent function of gna <dig> the conditions chosen should also reveal a function in light response and adaptation. the availability of strains expressing a constitutively active gna <dig> thereby allowed for the identification of a potential feedback mechanism, which would regulate transcription of gna <dig> and thus abundance of gna <dig>  due to activation of the gna1-related pathway . we observed that in contrast to transcription of the gα subunit gene gna <dig>  <cit> , transcription of gna <dig> is only marginally regulated in response to light in the wild type. on lactose, the transcript abundances and patterns of gna <dig> in the gna1ql strains resemble those of the wild-type strain. however, we found clear differences upon constitutive activation of gna <dig> on glucose and glycerol. thereby, transcript abundance of gna <dig> is strongly enhanced on glycerol in gna1ql as compared to the wild type , but decreased  on glucose in gna1ql . since the only difference in these strains to the wild-type strain is the presence of the additional allele  enabling expression of the constitutively active gα subunit, we conclude that although transcribed, wild-type gna <dig> normally is mainly present in its inactive state under these conditions and that these differences reflect the effect of activation of gna <dig> in case of ligand binding to the receptor. these alterations also prove that the additional mutated gna <dig> allele is indeed expressed. hence gna <dig> is subject to carbon source-dependent positive as well as negative regulation by activated gna <dig> 

gna <dig> regulates cellulase gene transcription in h. jecorina
since the c. parasitica homologue of gna <dig>  is essential for cellulase gene expression in this fungus  <cit> , we tested whether gna <dig> would exert a similar regulatory function in h. jecorina. the cellulase gene cbh <dig>  encoding cel7a, which makes up for 60% of the total cellulases secreted by h. jecorina was used to test this hypothesis. most of the cellulases of h. jecorina have been shown to be coordinately induced by cellulose, lactose and sophorose in h. jecorina  <cit>  and regulation of cbh <dig> can therefore be considered representative for cellulase regulation. due to the reported effect of illumination on cellulase gene expression  <cit>  we examined expression patterns either under constant illumination or constant darkness. using constant illumination and 1%  microcrystalline cellulose as carbon source, cbh <dig> transcript accumulation was undetectable in the Δgna <dig> mutant strain, while under the same conditions in constant darkness a strongly increased cellulase transcription  was detected . in the mutant strains expressing constitutively activated gna <dig> we observed an increased accumulation of cbh <dig> transcripts on cellulose in light  and no major changes in darkness . based on these findings we conclude that gna <dig> is involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression on cellulose. this regulatory impact differs between cultivation in light or darkness.

constitutive activation of gna <dig> does not overcome inducer dependence of cellulase formation in h. jecorina
the influence of gna <dig> on transcription of cbh <dig> could in theory be interpreted by activation of gna <dig> after binding of the cellulase inducer to the g-protein coupled receptor associated with gna <dig>  consequently, gna <dig> would transmit the cellulose signal from outside the cell to the cellulase transcription machinery. if this were the case, strains bearing the constitutively activated gna <dig> allele should also be capable of forming cellulases in the absence of their inducer. to test this possibility, we grew these strains on glycerol or glucose as carbon source, and examined cellulase transcription. on glycerol, cellulase expression can be induced by the addition of for example the strong inducer sophorose, whereas glucose represses the induction of cellulase gene expression by inducer exclusion . however, no cbh <dig> transcript could be detected under these conditions, neither in darkness nor after several hours of illumination . thus the constitutive activation of gna <dig> does not result in inducer-independent cellulase gene transcription. consequently, it could be concluded that gna <dig> transmits a fundamental signal for cellulase gene expression, but this signal is not the sole determinant for their induction. considering there are  <dig> g-protein coupled receptors and only  <dig> gα subunits in the genome of h. jecorina  <cit>  the gna <dig> signal is/are important for cellulase regulation but not sufficient for their induction.

gna <dig> impacts regulation of the hydrophobin genes hfb <dig> and hfb2
previous studies on cpg- <dig>  the c. parasitica homologue of gna <dig>  revealed that this g-protein α subunit suppresses transcript accumulation of the hydrophobin cryparin   <cit> . we therefore tested whether gna <dig> has an influence on the formation of the two best characterized  <cit>  class ii hydrophobins of h. jecorina, hfb <dig> and hfb <dig>  since the transcription of hydrophobins is also influenced by illumination  <cit> , these experiments were again performed in the presence and absence of light.

the results are shown in figure 6: hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> transcripts are found to be more abundant in constant darkness than in constant light upon cultivation on cellulose. both genes are upregulated in the Δgna <dig> strain in darkness , whereas gna <dig> had hardly any influence in the presence of light. constitutive activation of gna <dig> did not have a considerable effect on transcription of hfb <dig> and hfb <dig>  thus gna <dig> seems to be active under the conditions tested and most likely establishes an equilibrium upon activation, which becomes imbalanced when gna <dig> is lacking, but which cannot be altered considerably by expression of additional, constitutively active gna <dig> 

discussion
elucidation of the roles of heterotrimeric g-protein pathways in various important processes in fungi has been subject to intensive investigation in recent years  <cit> . consequently, many different functions specifically exerted by the gα subunit as well as such exerted via the effect of deletion or constitutive activation of the gα subunit on the β and γ subunit functions  <cit>  for these proteins are already known  <cit> . these detailed studies also revealed that despite considerable sequence similarity among gα subunits, their functions in some cases show distinct variations between species. in this study we report on the characterization of a g-protein α subunit encoding gene  from the ascomycete hypocrea jecorina . for the first time in fungi we show here a detailed analysis of the effect of a class i gα subunit under controlled light conditions. as was previously reported for orthologs in other fungi, we observed an influence of gna <dig> on sporulation efficiency  <cit>  as well as biomass formation  <cit> . interestingly, the influence on biomass formation was dependent on the light status. this suggested that gna <dig> might relate a carbon source-dependent signal, the physiological significance of which differs between light and darkness. the severe growth defect of the gna <dig> deletion compared to the same mutation in other fungi  <cit>  was only observed in darkness and only in liquid culture.

since the effect of the deletion or constitutive activation of gna <dig> does not point in different directions  in light, it most likely involves the function of the gβ subunit. similarly, yang et al.  <cit>  showed that the n. crassa g-protein β subunit gnb- <dig> directly regulates apical extension rate and mass accumulation. a light-dependent function of n. crassa gna- <dig> in this respect has also been reported  <cit> . while our results do not allow for a clear determination of the contribution of gna <dig> to this mechanism, the finding that deletion of gna <dig> results in a severe growth defect in darkness both on glucose and glycerol indicates that growth is likely to be also regulated by gna <dig> and not only by its influence on the g-protein β and γ subunits.

h. atroviridis strains deleted for the gna <dig> homologue tga <dig> show drastically reduced growth and form compact upraised colonies. in addition, continuous, light-independent conidiation was observed with these strains  <cit> . rocha-ramirez et al.  <cit>  reported that h. atroviridis tga <dig> overexpressing strains and strains expressing constitutively activated tga <dig> exhibit a fluffy phenotype and no alteration in growth compared to the wild type but inhibited sporulation. none of the overexpression strains produced a conidiation ring after a light pulse. gα antisense mutant strains were characterized by the formation of rather dense and small colonies, continuous sporulation independent of light stimulation and the production of a yellowish pigment  <cit> . these results are in striking contrast to our findings for h. jecorina, which showed only minor growth defects on solid medium caused by deletion of gna <dig> compared to h. atroviridis, which suggests at least in part different output targets of the gna <dig> signal in these two fungi.

the main objective of this study was to investigate whether gna <dig> would be involved in the transduction of cellulase inducing signals, a regulatory target for heterotrimeric g-protein signaling, as recently also shown for h. jecorina gna <dig>  <cit> . first hints as to an involvement of g-protein-mediated signal transduction in regulation of cellulase gene expression were provided by  <cit>  in describing the involvement of cpg- <dig> in c. parasitica. this g-protein α subunit is 98% identical to gna <dig> in h. jecorina and is involved in cellulose-mediated induction of the biosynthesis of cellulases. in accordance with these results it could be speculated that constitutive activation of gna <dig> might lead to inducer independent cellulase transcription. additionally, camp levels, which are influenced by gna- <dig> in n. crassa  <cit> , but only moderately in h. jecorina, have been shown to modulate cellulase gene expression  <cit>  as does the light status during cultivation  <cit> . indeed, we show that h. jecorina gna <dig> is an important member of the signaling cascade targeting cellulase regulation and that obviously the light status is important for the effect  of its receptor signal along with the carbon source available. however, constitutive activation of gna <dig> did not cause cellulase gene expression in the absence of an inducer. we conclude that gna <dig> transmits a signal, which is essential for cellulase transcription on cellulose only in light, but has a negative effect in darkness, which however does not lead to a decrease below wild-type levels upon constitutive activation of gna <dig>  hence further factors are likely to establish and maintain certain cellulase levels.

at the present stage we cannot specify whether the light response pathway acts directly on gna <dig> or on signaling components downstream of gna <dig>  nevertheless, a regulation of transcription of gna <dig> by the white collar complex  comprising the h. jecorina orthologs of n. crassa wc- <dig> and wc- <dig>  is unlikely since no significant light regulation was observed for gna <dig>  however, an involvement of these photoreceptors in regulating activity or stability of gna <dig> cannot be excluded. constitutive activation of gna <dig>  another gα subunit also does not enable inducer independent cellulase expression  <cit> . intriguingly, a similarly strong effect on cellulase gene transcription as upon deletion of gna <dig> in darkness is seen for constitutive activation of gna <dig> in light. an interconnection of the roles of these gα subunits with respect to the light status as well as the involvement of blr <dig> and blr <dig> in this process is therefore currently subject to further investigation. these results indicate that higher order regulatory factors must be present to facilitate both basic levels as well as fine-tuned adaptation to the environment, which is reflected by an obviously restricted effect of gna <dig> in some cases. hence both gα subunits relate a signal, the relevance of which depends on the light status, but is only modulary instead of essential for cellulase gene expression under most conditions. additionally, the presence of  <dig> g-protein coupled receptors, but only  <dig> gα subunits in the genome of h. jecorina  <cit> , suggests that gna <dig> and possibly gna <dig> transmit several signals and thus integrate these environmental cues to a defined message in the signaling cascade.

our ongoing studies on heterotrimeric g-protein signaling suggest a regulatory interrelationship between gna <dig> and gna <dig> as well as an interconnection to the light response pathway , which warrants further detailed investigations. it seems that such a sensing mechanism needs additional regulatory levels. consequently, while our data clearly show that gna <dig> is involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression, a general role in the respective induction process was not observed. gna <dig> is likely to only represent one of several key components necessary to initiate cellulase gene expression and the precise nature of the signal gna <dig> transmits, remains to be determined.

due to the only moderate influence of gna <dig> on camp levels, the considerable effect on cellulase gene expression upon deletion of gna <dig> is unlikely to be a consequence of this function. rather, it can be expected that gna <dig> is one constituent of a group of signaling components establishing a steady state equilibrium, which becomes unbalanced upon deletion of gna <dig> 

the surprising impact of constitutive activation of gna <dig> on transcription of gna <dig> could be interpreted as a carbon source-dependent feedback cycle, which can define the significance of the gna <dig> signal under certain conditions by regulating its abundance, although a potential effect of both stability and activation of gna <dig> must be kept in mind. such a mechanism would necessitate that one target of the gna <dig> signal transduction pathway would be a transcription factor binding to the gna <dig> promoter. the fact that this feedback is different on different carbon sources suggests that binding, activation  and/or stability  of this transcription factor are dependent on the carbon source. such a feedback cycle could determine the relevance of the respective signal under the current environmental  conditions. by adjusting transcription of gna <dig>  rapid and appropriate response to these changing conditions is facilitated, once the receptor becomes activated. however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis and to elucidate the members of such a mechanism and their functions.

segers and nuss  <cit>  suggested a surveillance system, which would modulate the stability of a subunit in response to a mutation or absence of a certain component of the heterotrimeric g-protein signaling machinery. considering our data this hypothesis could be modified to integrate environmental signals into the regulation of stability, and additionally transcription efficiency, of a certain subunit. the postulated feedback regulation of gna <dig> and especially the light-dependent role in cellulase transcription thus supports the hypothesis of a sophisticated fine-tuning mechanism for crosstalk of light response and carbon source signal transduction as already suggested earlier  <cit> .

regulation of a hydrophobin gene by a gα subunit was first shown for the gna <dig> homologue of c. parasitica  <cit> . in support of this result, we also observed different wetability of mycelia in strains expressing constitutively activated gna <dig> or deleted for gna <dig>  hydrophobins have been shown to be regulated due to the developmental stage and in response to numerous environmental cues such as the nature or availability of nutrients and light not only in h. jecorina  <cit> , but also in several other fungi  <cit> . because of the possible use of hydrophobins in industrial applications  <cit>  these findings can also contribute to strain improvement and optimization of the respective biotechnological processes.

analysis of transcription of the two class ii hydrophobin genes hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> of h. jecorina suggest that gna <dig> negatively regulates both genes. although hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> have been shown to be involved in regulation of hyphal development  and sporulation   <cit>  our data on these characteristics in light and darkness for constitutive activation or deletion of gna <dig> do not support the hypothesis that the phenotype of these mutants could be explained by the effect of gna <dig> on the hydrophobin genes. additionally, gna <dig> appears not to be solely responsible for regulation of hydrophobin expression since constitutive activation does not result in decreased transcription below wild-type levels. as is the case with regulation of cellulase gene expression, gna <dig> delivers an important yet not essential signal for regulation of hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, gna <dig> is suggested to be involved in appropriating available resources to be used in biomass formation, biosynthesis of hydrolytic enzymes or promotion/obstruction of another energy-consuming process of higher/lower priority under the current environmental conditions. one important environmental cue thereby is the presence of light, which now has been shown to influence two gα subunits in h. jecorina. hence gna <dig>  is likely to be important for adaptation to the day/night cycle. this hypothesis is mainly supported by the indications of an involvement of gna <dig> or the gβγ complex, respectively, in a light-dependent manner for different processes, but also by the recent findings of a light-dependent function of gna <dig>  <cit> . carbon source-dependent feedback regulation would be one logical junction for such modulations. autoregulation of gα subunits has been suggested in mammals  <cit>  and positive as well as negative feedback regulation via downstream effectors of gα subunits has been shown in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . moreover, certain feedback regulation via the gβγ complex cannot be excluded in n. crassa  <cit> . we postulate that gna <dig> is likely to contact different g-protein coupled receptors and that the respective signaling pathway is interconnected with other signaling and regulatory pathways, which limit the effect of the gna <dig> signal.
