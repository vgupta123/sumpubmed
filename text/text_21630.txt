BACKGROUND
according to the historical geology of southeast asia, most philippine islands are relatively young, originating about five million years ago   <cit> . the older islands of the philippines, including palawan, mindoro and zamboanga, are located on the edges of the eurasian plate and may have been moving away from the main landmass since the early miocene . until approximately 5– <dig> mya, the crust of the older plate was a part of borneo . the malay peninsula, borneo, sumatra and java together comprise the sunda shelf. when sea levels were low during the glacial maxima, the malay peninsula, borneo, sumatra, java, bali and the philippines were interconnected via land bridges, making species migrations possible  <cit> . in addition, western sulawesi had been a part of the sunda shelf in ancient times but slid away during the palaeocene . the formation of the deep makassar strait divided western sulawesi from the sunda shelf, preventing further dispersal of bornean species to sulawesi. this history geology accounts for the high degree of endemism among the fauna and flora of sulawesi  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> geographical distribution of six species/subspecies of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex and southeast asia landmasses between the pleistocene and the present. in pleistocene times, indochina, malaya, sumatra, java, borneo, and the philippines were interconnected and were separated from sulawesi by the makassar strait. four phylogeographic break lines were shown in red dashed lines  and distribution region of six species/subspecies of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex drawed by different color in the map. images for six species/subspecies of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex were photographed by cc tsai 



the p. amabilis species complex includes p. amabilis ssp. amabilis, p. amabilis ssp. moluccana, p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii, p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite, p. aphrodite ssp. formosana and p. sanderiana. these species and their subspecies were placed in the section phalaenopsis  <cit> . the species complex spans a broad geographic range, including southeastern taiwan, the philippines, borneo, sumatra , java, sulawesi, molucca is., new guinea, and northeastern australia  , and has a complicated biogeography because these regions border two palaeocontinents  <cit> . these regions have long attracted the attention of biogeographers, and several phylogeographical breaks have been introduced   <cit> . species/subspecies of the species complex shared most morphological characters, except for lip-midlobes and calli. the distributional patterns coincided with the geographic isolations via historical phylogeographic breaks between borneo + palawan and the philippines , between borneo and sulawesi , between sulawesi and molucca is. , and between sulawesi and new guinea + australia   <cit> .

phalaenopsis amabilis ssp. amabilis is widespread, extending from the southern philippines  to borneo, sumatra and java. another subspecies, p. amabilis ssp. moluccana, is strictly distributed in the molucca islands  and sulawesi. there is a phylogeographic break  between these two subspecies   <cit> . phalaenopsis amabilis ssp. moluccana is easily recognised by the shape of the midlobe of the lip, which is linear-oblong with a slight dilation toward the base instead of being cruciform  <cit>  . p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii is distributed in new guinea , new ireland  and australia . this subspecies differs from p. amabilis ssp. amabilis and p. amabilis ssp. moluccana in having a lip with a triangular midlobe, as in p. aphrodite and p. sanderiana . phalaenopsis amabilis ssp. moluccana and p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii are separated by a phylogeographic break at the lydekker’s line  <cit> .table  <dig> differentiated characters among six species/subspecies of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex

given high resemblance between p. aphrodite and p. amabilis, p. aphrodite was ever once placed under p. amabilis, i.e., p. amabilis var. aphrodite  <cit> . in contrast, sweet  <cit>  recognised it as a distinct species based on characteristics of the callus and midlobe shape, and the geographical subdivision by the lydekker’s line  <cit> . p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite is distributed throughout the philippines with exceptions of mindanao and palawan  <cit> . its calli have a posterior edge dividing into four teeth, unlike the two-toothed calli of p. amabilis  <cit>  . another subspecies, p. aphrodite ssp. formosana, is distributed only in southeastern taiwan and can be distinguished from p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite by its apple-green leaves with no trace of anthocyanin pigments, somewhat smaller flowers, and many-branched panicles  <cit>  .

another phyloegnetically related species  <cit> , p. sanderiana, has a restricted distribution in the southern philippines   <cit> . its callus structure shows four teeth, with the inner teeth longer than the outer ones. the four teeth of p. aphrodite, in contrast, are subequal, with the two outer teeth only slightly longer than the inner ones  <cit>  . the distributions of p. sanderiana and p. amabilis ssp. amabilis are divided by huxley’s line, and those of p. sanderiana and p. amabilis ssp. moluccana are divided by wallace’s line  <cit> .

it is known that phylogeographic patterns are determined by the interplay between dispersal and vicariance  <cit> . vicariance arises from changes in the earth’s surface from changes in sea level or the separation of similar environments by climatic, geological or other changes in intervening regions, resulting in the fragmentation of continuously distributed taxa  <cit> . dipersal across isolating barriers, which can disrupt the preexisting vicaricance patterns, might also predominate in the oceanic island biogeography  <cit> . this species complex is a good tool by which to study biogeography because this p. amabilis complex is distributed throughout the region between southeast asia and australia, where several phylogeographic break lines have been identified. here, based on the distribution patterns of the taxa in the species complex across these geographical regions, if vicariance exclusively determined the species split, one would expect reciprocal monophyly of p. aphordite, p. amabilis, and p. sanderiana, which were divided by huxley’s and wallace’s lines. affinity among p. amabilis ssp. amabilis, ssp. moluccana, and ssp. rosenstromii separated by wallace’s and weber’s lines remains testable. in other word, christenson’s  <cit>  taxonomy is served as the biogeographical hypothesis.

in this study, dna fragments of the internal transcribed spacer  of nuclear ribosomal dna and the trnh-psba intergenic spacer of plastid dna were employed. several questions were addressed. 1) is monophyly of the species of the complex supported? 2) is the geographic disjunction in this species complex due to vicariance or long-distance dispersal? 3) what is the demographic history of p. amabilis complex? 4) what is the extent of gene flow between species?

phylogenetic reconstruction
genealogy was reconstructed based on the its <dig> and its <dig> and plastid dna haplotypes of the p. amabilis complex, rooted at three species of the p. schilleriana complex, including p. schilleriana, p. stuartiana, and p. philippinensis . in the its <dig> and its <dig> sequences, a total of  <dig> variable sites  and  <dig> indels were found among the species/subspecies of the p. amabilis complex. based on the phylogenetic tree, the six taxa of the p. amabilis complex were closely related with high bootstrap supporting in both nj and mp phylogenetic trees . phalaenopsis aphrodite ssp. aphrodite and p. aphrodite ssp. formosana clustered together. subspecies of p. aphrodite are not distinguishable from each other, whereas they were separable from other members of the p. amabilis complex. subspecies of p. amabilis, except for the palawan populations, and p. sanderiana formed a clade. within the p. amabilis/p. sanderiana clade, two subclades were identified, rooted by p. amabilis ssp. amabilis from palawan. the first subclades showed distinct geographic subdivision, including p. sanderiana, p. amabilis ssp. amabilis from java and ssp. moluccana from molucca island. nevertheless, p. amabilis ssp. amabilis from timor and p. amabilis ssp. rosentromii cannot be distinguished from each other. the other subclade included all p. amabilis ssp. amabilis from mentawai island, sabah  and the one from palawan .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships using neighbor joining  and maxinum pasimony  methods of the  <dig> accessions in the p. amabilis species complex, plus the three outgroups p. schilleriana, p. stuartiana and p. philippinensis, obtained from sequence comparisons of  the its region of nrdna and  the cpdna trnh-psba spacer sequence and generated by mega  <dig>  and phylip  <dig> . numbers at nodes represent bootstrap values over 50 % of nj and mp between major lineages



in the trnh-psba spacer,  <dig> variable sites and  <dig> indels were found among the species/subspecies of the p. amabilis complex. the phylogeny inferred from the plastid dna was largely consistent with those from the its data and provided better resolution in the geographic subdivision. the phalaenopsis amabilis complex consisted of two clades with high bootstrapping supports in both nj and mp phylogenetic trees, one for p. amabilis with its subspecies and p. sanderiana and the other for p. aphrodite . the clade including p. amabilis/p. sanderiana consisted of two geographic groups , however, the timor population was not closely related to p. amabilis ssp. rosentromii but was related to the mentawei island population fig.  <dig> ancestral distributions reconstructed by rasp. phylogenetic relationships of the  <dig> accessions in the p. amabilis species complex, plus the three outgroups p. schilleriana, p. stuartiana and p. philippinensis, obtained from sequence comparisons of the cpdna trnh-psba spacer sequence and generated by beast. bayesian credibility values  are indicated above the branch on one of the post-burn bayesian trees. the distribution areas of extant accessions of p. amabilis species are marked in capitals a–j , respectively. the grey circles indicate the vicariance events and the circles with dashed line indicate the long-distance dispersal  events obtained from the rasp analysis, respectively

based on nuclear and plastid dnas, tests for the molecular-clock hypothesis using tajima’s d revealed no significant violations of the assumption of selective neutrality . based on substitution rates of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> subs/site/yr for the plastid dna spacer, the coalescence time of the p. amabilis complex was estimated to be  <dig>  mya, with 95 % confidence intervals  of  <dig> – <dig>  mya . within the p. amabilis complex, the coalescence times based on the trnh-psba spacer were estimated at  <dig>  mya ,  <dig>  mya , and  <dig>  mya  for three taxa within p. amabilis complex. in addition, the coalescence time of p. amabilis ssp. moluccana was tracked back to  <dig>  mya  .table  <dig> results of calescence time estimations performed with beast  <dig> . <dig> for the phalaenopsis amabilis complex based on the trnh-psba spacer of chloroplast dna

demographic history and historical biogeography inference
a bayesian skyline plot was used to estimate population dynamics. plastid dna showed historical demographic growth followed by recent steadiness in the p. amabilis complex in the late lgm due to extinction of regional populations . mismatch analyses of plastid dna sequences displayed a multimodal distribution pattern with a non-significant sum of squared deviations  statistic and the raggedness index  value under both sudden- and spatial-expansion models in the p. amabilis complex . in addition, negative fu’s fs values suggested demorgraphic expansion under both sudden- and spatial-expansion model in p. amabilis .fig.  <dig> the effective population size over time for all accessions in the p. amabilis species complex based on the cpdna trnh-psba spacer using bayesian skyline plots analyses. the last glacial maximum  is green color shaded. solid lines indicate median estimations; area between gray dash lines indicates 95 % confidence intervals

to infer vicariance and dispersal events in the p. amabilis complex, ancestral ranges were obtained by rasp analysis of plastid dna . rasp detected  <dig> vicariance,  <dig> dispersal, and  <dig> extinction events in the whole phylogenetic demography, suggesting a complicatedbiogeographical history in which vicariance, dispersal, and vicariance + dispersal played critical roles in shaping the current distribution in p. amabilis species complex. accordingly, the extant distributions of species and subspecies of the p. amabilis complex may have largely been shaped by vicariance events, with relatively rare events of dispersal + vicariance or dispersal. the results supported vicariance events between p. amabilis and p. aphrodite , between p. amabilis and p. sanderiana, and between p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii and ssp. moluccana/ssp. amabilis from sabah and palawan/p. sanderiana . in contrast, the analysis of plastid dna suggested that the extant distribution of p. aphrodite was likely shaped by dispersal . the patterns of the biogeographic reconstruction executed by lagrange are presented in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  lagrange and rasp methods created similar patterns. however, lagrange generally estimated in terms of relative probabilities at nodes and a better range of possible ancestral areas at nodes usually inferred a favored reconstruction. the ancestral range of p. amabilis complex  was estimated to have been in the java and southern taiwan with  <dig>  of relative probability . likewise, the ancestral ranges of p. aphrodite , p. amabilis , and p. sanderiana  were likely in southern taiwan with  <dig>  of relative probability, java / new guinea with  <dig>  of relative probability, and mindanao with  <dig>  of relative probability, respectively.fig.  <dig> historical biogeographical reconstruction using lagrange on the p. amabilis species complex topology. coloured squares indicate reconstructed ancestral ranges and the square size is proportional to the probability of the reconstructions . the geographic ranges of species are displayed at right. : ‘left’ and ‘right’ are the ranges inherited by each descendant branch . the distribution areas of extant accessions of p. amabilis species are marked in capitals a–j , respectively

discussion
phylogeny of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex
the taxonomy of the phalaenopsis amabilis species complex is difficult to resolve  <cit> , given very few diagnosable morphological characters and occurrence of interspecific hybridisation yields numerous intermediate morphs. nevertheless, unique biogeographical patterns with high levels of endemism on islands exist in the sunda shelf and the philippine archipelagos  <cit> , reflecting interesting but complicated divergence processes. in this study, two molecular markers provided supplementary information, with patterns in nrits shaped by concerted evolution  <cit> , whereas plastid dna genes showed no evidence of genetic recombination  <cit> . phylogenetic trees derived from nuclear and plastid dnas supported the monophyly of the species complex. p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite and p. aphrodite ssp. formosana formed a sister group to other species, but are difficult to distinguish from each other. morphologically, p. aphrodite ssp. formosana, which lacks anthocyanin, is only slightly differentiated from p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite  <cit> .

phalaenopsis amabilis is distinguishable from p. aphrodite, and both display geographic subdivision based on characteristics of the callus. the reciprocal monophyly of three subspecies of p. amabilis, with p. amabilis ssp. moluccana and p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii clustering first was supported by the plastid-dna-based tree  but not the nuclear-dna-based tree . the systematic inconsistency between the two trees might derive from differences in the modes of inheritance, with plastid dna and the its region being maternally and biparentally inherited, respectively  <cit> . close affinity between sister groups of p. amabilis and p. sanderiana based on plastid dna  revealed a biogeographcial pattern subdivided by huxley’s line   <cit> . in addition, the p. amabilis population of timor and two subspecies of p. amabilis distributed in regions east of wallace’s line  formed a clade in the nuclear-dna-based tree, supporting another geographic subdivision by weber’s line. nevertheless, some samples from palawan populations mixed with those of the p. amabilis complex in a nuclear-its-based tree, indicating possible paternal gene flow . this result suggests long-distance pollen dispersal in p. amabilis. such dispersal would usually occur with the aid of large pollinators, such as carpenter bees   <cit> , which are capable of flying  <cit> .

morphologically, the callus structure of p. sanderiana can be distinguished from those of p. amabilis and p. aphrodite  <cit> . according to phylogenetic trees derived from nuclear and plastid dnas, p. sanderiana alone formed a clade, nested in p. amabilis, making the latter species paraphyletic.

biogeography and evolutionary trends
gene genealogies were used to extract data on historical gene flow  <cit> , hybridisation  <cit>  and divergence between lineages . according to the phylogenies based on nuclear  and plastid dna , p. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite and ssp. formosana distributed in the philippines and taiwan is a sister species to the rest of the p. amabilis complex. p. aphrodite ssp. formosana is geographically restricted to taiwan. this subspecies represented the northernmost limitation in distribution for phalaenopsis, while p. aphrodite is distributed throughout the philippines  <cit> . in addition, the philippines are the centre of diversity for species of this group of phalaenopsis spp.   <cit> , as all members of the section phalaenopsis, except for p. amabilis, were found in the philippines  <cit> . in addition, several old islands of the philippines, including palawan, mindoro and zamboanga, were separated from the eurasian plate when the crust of the plate hit borneo approximately 5– <dig> mya , providing a refuge for the diverging species.

phalaenopsis aphrodite is absent in palawan and southern mindanao  <cit> . these two islands were interconnected during the glacial periods  <cit>  , providing opportunities for population expansion. furthermore, p. aphrodite probably dispersed into taiwan during the glacial maxima, as the taiwan-luzon-mindoro belt was formed in the late eocene  <cit> . phylogenetically, p. aphrodite ssp. formosana and p. aphrodite are very similar based on the nuclear its and the chloroplast trnh-psba spacer. the coalescence of p. aphrodite can be traced to approximately  <dig>  mya , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya  during the pleistocene glaciations. the philippine archipelagos, except for palawan, formed the super island  <cit>  and were periodically linked and unlinked to the sunda shelf by the land bridge between mindoro, palawan, and borneo. the most recent link likely formed approximately  <dig> – <dig>  mya as a result of lowered pleistocene sea levels  <cit>  and p. aphrodite probably dispersed among mindoro, palawan, borneo, and taiwan. this geographic disjunction likely contributed to the vicariance between the philippine archipelagos and continental asia.

geographically, p. amabilis is separated from p. amabilis ssp. moluccana and p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii by wallace’s line. there is divergence between floral and faunal species in the regions west and east of wallace’s line  <cit> . biogeographical subdivision also occurred between p. amabilis ssp. moluccana  and p. amabilis ssp. rosenstromii . the coalescence of p. amabilis can be dated to  <dig>  mya  by the plastid trnh-psba, likely in association with the würm glaciation. this finding is in agreement with the phylogeographical break described by weber  <cit> . the current biota in this geographic area therefore show evidence of vicariace from the sunda shelf west of new guinea/australia  <cit> .

inconsistent phylogenetic demographies between nuclear and plastid markers indicate historical introgression/hybridisation  <cit>  between p. amabilis and p. aphrodite  may due to recombination by paternal gene flow . the p. amabilis distributed in palawan is closely related to the p. amabilis distributed in borneo based on maternal molecular data and historical connection by land bridges  <cit>  between the sunda shelf and the philippine archipelagos, however, p. amabilis was paraphyletic according to the nuclear its, with one major clade distributed in palawan and one haplotype clustering with p. aphrodite. the coalescence time based on plastid data was less than  <dig>  mya between the palawan and borneo populations, indicating a very recent split. that result is consistent with the topophysiographic data  <cit> .

phalaenopsis sanderiana forms a clade  linked to p. amabilis of borneo/palawan. geographically, p. sanderiana is exclusively found in southern mindanao  <cit> . several islands between southern mindanao and borneo may have formed a land bridge during the glacial maxima, providing opportunities for dispersal from borneo to southern mindanao  <cit> .

rasp analyses also suggested that the current disjunct distribution of the p. amabilis complex might reflect vicariant relicts of an ancestral population . this finding concurs with findings for other disjunctions at the sunda shelf and philippine archipelagos or sunda shelf and new guinea/australia  <cit> . in addition, several vicariance, dispersal, and vicariance + dispersal events detected using rasp  revealed geographic isolation among populations/taxa during the pleistocene, likely as a result of the landbridge submergence  <cit> .

conservation genetics of p. amabilis complex
phalaenopsis amabilis complex represents a group of epiphytes of typical evergreen forests throughout tropical asia and the larger islands of the pacific ocean; the whole region was the ancient sunderland and great sunda island during the pleistocene glaciation  <cit> . as epiphytic species widespread in tropical asia, the p. amabilis complex is expected to have had a large ancestral population. in this study, population growth was detected with sudden- and spatial-mismatch distribution models for three taxa and the species complex based on the bayesian skyline plots using beast program for species. at plastid marker, a continuous demographic expansion from mindel to würm pleistocene period of the p. amabilis complex was detected, followed by subsequent reversed population slowdown after lgm . climate changes in the quaternary that triggered isolation and local extinction based on  <dig> extinction events detected by rasp  may explain the increased differentiation rates during that period  <cit> . during the pleistocene, geographic fluctuations in the sunda shelf, philippine archipelagos, and new guinea/australia resulted in population fragmentation. at the same, colonization via long distance dispersal also occurred. the ancestral population of the p. amabilis complex was likely to split into p. aphrodite, p. amabilis, and p. sanderiana by geological vicariance associated with huxley’s line  <cit>  and wallace’s line  <cit> .

at the species level, the nucleotide diversity of nuclear dna  and cpdna  was low  compared to other flowering plants from the same geographic region, such as kandelia candel , ceriops tagal , bruguiera gymnorrhiza . as an epiphyte growing in vulnerable habitats across a wide distribution, all local populations tend to be small, strengthening the effects of genetic drift  <cit> . therefore, taxa of the p. amabilis complex tend to have low genetic diversity at the intraspecific level in both nuclear and plastid dnas and populations are fixed at a single haplotype .

moreover, the nucleotide diversity of other sympatrically distributed species and the p. amabilis complex reflects the effects of a common geological history, likely including the quaternary glacial circle  <cit> . at the population and species levels, the combination of low genetic diversity and high levels of genetic differentiation in the p. amabilis complex indicate that populations of this species were isolated from each other and experienced either extreme bottlenecks  or founder effects  <cit> . furthermore, the unique interactions between orchids and pollinators  <cit>  and the habitat preferences  <cit>  strengthened the genetic differentiation among populations/species. given such genetic background, most species, apparently, face threats of human exploitation of natural forests that inevitably led to shrinkage of populations of the species complex. conservation of these evolving species/subspecies is therefore urgent and required.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, variations in nuclear and plastid dna revealed that the disjunct distribution of the p. amabilis complex likely resulted from vicariance or vicariance + dispersal in the middle–late pleistocene. due to the submergence of the sunda shelf, philippine archipelagos, and new guinea/australia, p. aphrodite was separated from other members of the p. amabilis complex. within p. aphrodite, the admixture of populations made subspecies indistinguishable, suggesting a history of long-distance dispersal. in contrast, the species and subspecies of p. amabilis with disjunct distributions were differentiated due to vicariance. after divergence, the species complex experienced isolation and in situ range expansion as well as population growth during subsequent climatic oscillations in the würm glacial period. population slowdown following the end of the lgm may have occurred by an extinction of local or island populations owing to a reduction in suitable habitats and formed the contemporary pattern of geographic distribution.
