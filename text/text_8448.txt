BACKGROUND
the first complete bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of haemophilus influenza  <cit> . seventeen years later, techniques for sequence determination and automated annotation tools have improved dramatically  <cit> . genome sequences are now considered to be highly redundant and thus accurate when fully assembled. however, genome annotation is still far from being perfect, either in terms of structure  or in terms of functional assignments  <cit> . an in-silico genome analysis estimated almost 60% erroneous start codon prediction in some prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . the genomes of almost  <dig> living cellular organisms from the three domains of life have been sequenced and annotated to date:  <dig> bacteria,  <dig> archaea, and forty eukarya . the annotation of subsequent thousands of genomes expected to be released within the coming months  will rely, in almost all cases, on automated annotation pipelines and will be deposited as such in repository databases with no manual verification  <cit> .

new strategies have been proposed to better annotate genomes with the integration of experimental data collected at the transcriptome or proteome levels . the expressed genome can give a reliable refinement of genome annotation and can be further extended to other related genomes by comparative genomics. in this way, massive transcriptome sequencing  has been carried out for caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  and vitis vinifera  <cit> , producing a large list of novel, transcribed sequences and alternative splicing information. however, many rnas are non-coding and, therefore, coding rnas that exhibit low similarities with other sequences should be further confirmed. hence, a more direct analysis of proteins is recommended. recent improvements in mass spectrometry have allowed high-throughput protein analysis by shotgun nanolc-ms/ms, which can generate useful information on thousands of proteins  <cit> . the integration of proteomic data into a nucleotide database translated in the six reading frames, in order to improve genome annotation, was first proposed by yates and co-workers  <cit>  and has subsequently been applied at a large genomic scale by many research groups  <cit> . the resulting information is used to identify novel genes that were missed in the first annotation and to correct annotation mistakes  <cit> . the mapping of mass spectrometry-certified peptides onto the nucleotide sequence has been applied at the primary annotation phase for at least three microorganisms: mycoplasma mobile  <cit> , deinococcus deserti  <cit> , and thermococcus gammatolerans  <cit> . integrating both transcriptomic and proteomic complementary approaches has already been carried out for pristionchus pacificus  <cit>  and geobacter sulfurreducens  <cit> . the main drawback of both approaches is that only a fraction of the transcriptome or the proteome can generally be observed under standard laboratory culture conditions for generalist lifestyle organisms, i.e. those with large genomes  <cit> .

on the basis of evolutionary constraints, re-annotations obtained by proteogenomics for one organism can be extended to all orthologous genes present in all phylogenetically related species. this approach, first proposed by gallien et al.  <cit>  for the mycobacterium genus, was tentatively called ortho-proteogenomics. a similar study has also been performed on yersinia pestis kim and extended, respectively, to the twenty-one closest yersinia species sequenced  <cit> . the integration of proteogenomic studies carried out on closely related species addresses several notorious problems encountered with mass spectrometry approaches. such is the case of the 'one-hit-wonders', proteins detected with only one ms/ms identified peptide which need to be evaluated with caution.

the roseobacter clade is a group of bacteria that can represent up to 20% of bacterioplankton communities in coastal environments and more than 10% in the open ocean  <cit> . the first roseobacter genome to be sequenced was that of ruegeria pomeroyi dss- <dig>  this genome consists of a  <dig>  mb chromosome and a  <dig>  mb megaplasmid, named pdss- <dig>  <cit> . a high number of roseobacter isolates have since been sequenced and many more are in progress in order to explore this important clade and to understand how ocean ecosystems function.

in the present study, we propose a re-annotation of the r. pomeroyi genome using experimental data obtained from a large proteomic survey recorded for this micro-organism. this ortho-proteogenomic study is the first to propose the extension of proteogenomic corrections to a large bacterial clade. moreover, we have detected highly abundant orphan proteins and discuss their significance.

RESULTS
proteogenomic strategy for the analysis of r. pomeroyi
an extensive analysis of the proteome of r. pomeroyi, cultivated in various conditions, resulted in a large dataset of ms/ms spectra . to assign these spectra to peptide sequences, we created a database comprising all translated stop-to-stop amino acid sequences of more than forty residues, taking into account the six-frame translation of the genome of r. pomeroyi. thus, this database comprises all the coding domain sequences  of the bacterium mixed with a large number of aberrant polypeptide sequences. all of the ms/ms spectra were searched against this database using the mascot engine, resulting in the identification of a restricted set of  <dig> probable orfs. a second search against this restricted database led to the assignment of  <dig>  <dig> spectra corresponding to  <dig>  <dig> non-redundant tryptic peptides . these peptides validated the presence in the cells of  <dig> polypeptides detected with at least two peptides . when comparing these mass spectrometry-certified orfs with the  <dig> previously annotated cdss  <cit> , we found that thirty-four orfs were missing. table  <dig> lists the corresponding proteins with their probable start and stop positions, as well as their putative function. remarkably, most of these are unknown. we also took into consideration those novel orfs detected with only one highly confident peptide  and showing no overlap with other proteomic-detected genes. applying these criteria resulted in the selection of seven targets. to give higher confidence to the validation of these 'one-hit-wonders', we checked whether these genes were transcribed. we extracted total rna from bacteria grown in the physiological conditions in which each polypeptide had been most abundantly detected during the proteomic survey. we performed rt-pcr amplification for five of these targets . supplementary additional file  <dig> shows the  <dig> non-redundant peptides assigned to the thirty-nine novel cdss to be subsequently considered. the culture conditions and proteome fraction in which each peptide was best detected is also indicated. regarding these cdss, we propose a novel nomenclature to indicate that their existence was experimentally verified by proteogenomics. it consists of the introduction of the two letters 'pg', standing for proteogenomics, and a number beside the spo nomenclature for annotated cdss encoded on the bacterial chromosome and spoa for those coded by the pdss- <dig> megaplasmid . we also identified ten orfs with peptides located further upstream than their annotated n-termini . this clearly indicated a wrongly identified translation start codon for the corresponding gene. we confirmed these corrections by blast analysis. in addition, we listed in a second query the semi-tryptic peptides that could correspond to the most-n-terminal peptide, as detailed elsewhere  <cit> .

novel cdss found in, a priori, non-coding genomic regions
as shown in table  <dig>  the spo_pg001- <dig> cdss were found to be encoded in genomic regions encompassing no previously annotated genes. among them, sixteen have no known homologues in any other sequenced roseobacter strains, while seven are homologous to proteins found in a limited number of roseobacter strains. generally, these genes encode small polypeptides  whereas the mean length of polypeptides encoded in the genome is greater than  <dig> amino acids. curiously, the well conserved rna helicase, spo_pg <dig>  was not previously annotated, due to the report of a putative translational frameshift in the sequence  <cit> . we definitively discarded this possibility due to the detection of a peptide situated from amino acid position  <dig> to  <dig> in the stop-to-stop amino acid sequence, with the hypothetical frameshift in position  <dig>  the sequence between this position and the end of spo_pg <dig> is badly conserved among the different roseobacter members, being a possible hotspot for the accumulation of mutations and the reason why a putative frameshift was at first predicted.

novel cdss indicating badly-annotated genes
spo_pg027- <dig> cdss were found to overlap with previously annotated cdss which had not been detected during the proteomic analysis. moreover, the previously annotated cdss did not exhibit any similarities with other bacterial proteins, as revealed by means of a psi-blast search. seven of the new proposed genes whose products were detected by tandem mass spectrometry showed high similarities to proteins encoded in other related members of the roseobacter clade . panel a of figure  <dig> represents the chromosome region view of the target spo_pg <dig>  it shows how the tryptic peptides identified allow a better definition of each cds on the genome, with no overlap between them. this figure also illustrates how the detection of the novel orf, spo_pg <dig>  is in total discordance with the possible existence of spo <dig> 

remarkably, twenty-one distinct peptides cover 77% of the full spo_pg <dig> polypeptide sequence. this protein was detected abundantly in the experimental conditions tested in the present study, with  <dig> spectral counts assigned to it . its sequence does not exhibit any similarities to other known proteins in any other sequenced organism. this specific gene, found in the r. pomeroyi genome, probably plays an important role in this bacterium as it was systematically detected in all of the biological samples analysed. panel b of figure  <dig> shows that this novel gene is found next to spo_pg <dig>  another re-annotated cds, and both are located between two conserved ribosomal protein operons. curiously, this intergenic region of  <dig>  kb in r. pomeroyi presents a high variability among the closest sequenced roseobacter members. this genomic area presented a variable size  and sequence, with no inter-species similarity. the existence of the previously annotated spo <dig> gene is undoubtedly false. it was assigned to the other dna strand and the corresponding short polypeptide product  did not show any similar protein by psi-blast. spo_pg <dig> is also highly detected by ms/ms as  <dig> spectra were assigned to this polypeptide . in contrast to spo_pg <dig>  spo_pg <dig> is highly conserved in other members of the roseobacter clade. curiously, spo_pg <dig> was missed, favouring the annotated spo <dig> cds, which gives no sequence homologue by means of psi-blast.

interestingly, the stop-to-stop orf comprising spo_pg <dig> overlapped the stop-to-stop orf comprising an already annotated gene  detected during the proteomic survey. spo <dig> was validated with twenty non-redundant peptides  but showed no similarities to other proteins by means of psi-blast. the first validated peptide of spo <dig> was identified  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the initially annotated start codon. this indicates that this gene could be shorter, resulting in no overlap with spo_pg <dig>  a similar case is that of spo_pg <dig> . the c-terminal region of this newly detected gene overlaps the n-terminal region of the stop-to-stop spo <dig> orf. a psi-blast search with the annotated sequence of spo <dig> clearly indicates, by comparison with its closest homologues, that this conserved esterase lipase in r. pomeroyi should be  <dig> amino acids shorter. in such a case, the start codon of spo <dig> would be in position  <dig>  <dig> on the chromosome, being consistent with the existence of spo_pg <dig> 

detection of sequencing errors
spo_pg036- <dig> cdss are highly conserved in other bacteria and all have putative assigned functions . like spo_pg <dig>  these genes were not considered at the primary stage of annotation  as they all presented a putative frameshift in their sequence. for the targets spo_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig>  we detected two peptides located in one reading frame, as well as a third peptide that could belong to the same polypeptide but in another reading frame . we double-checked the sequence of the nucleotide region where the plausible frameshift could occur and demonstrated a sequencing error in all four targets. in all cases we found an extra nucleotide in the sequence, which should be removed . these extra nucleotides led to changes in the reading-frame. the corrected protein sequences of these four targets are indicated in additional file  <dig>  they result in full-length proteins with higher similarities with their respective homologues. spo_pg <dig> is an interesting case revealed by the detection of a unique peptide. the corresponding polypeptide sequence does not share similarities with any protein present in other sequenced roseobacter members, but has some similarity with a conserved stress response protein present in the genus bacillus. as shown in figure  <dig>  the corresponding stop-to-stop orf in the genome of r. pomeroyi overlapped the highly conserved annotated gene, spo <dig>  the single peptide detected for this target, and the region exhibiting similarities to the stress response protein of bacillus, both reside at the n-terminus of the orf, in between the annotated genes, spo <dig> and spo <dig>  when the extra g was removed, the reading-frame of spo_pg <dig> was corrected, ending at a stop codon  before overlapping spo <dig> .

polypeptide n-terminus validation and correction
to confirm or correct the annotation of translational start codons of the cdss, we first searched for strictly tryptic peptides located upstream of those previously annotated in the stop-to-stop orf sequence. in addition, we searched for semi-tryptic peptides to identify possible authentic n-terminal peptides.

the search for peptides located further upstream than the previously annotated start codons  <cit>  led to the discovery of ten wrongly annotated cdss. these are listed in additional file  <dig>  the ten resulting n-terminal extensions did not overlap other genes. moreover, higher similarities were found by psi-blast with homologous genes annotated in other related species. of note, one of these corrected start codons is that of the conserved sucb gene, spo_ <dig>  which is just downstream of suca , as shown in figure  <dig>  another interesting case is that of spo_ <dig>  which shows high sequence similarities with its homologues found in the roseobacter clade. however, the first residues were found to be very dissimilar in comparison with its closest homologues. we sequenced the locus and found a sequence error with an extra g between positions  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  this would be the reason why a shorter sequence was at first assigned to this gene. the corrected n-terminus of the polypeptide sequence is now similar to its closest homologues.

the search for semi-tryptic peptides led to the discovery of the n-terminal peptides of  <dig> proteins . all of these were confirmed by psi-blast comparison with their counterparts in other species and by manual inspection:  <dig> peptides confirmed already well-annotated start codons, sixty-two peptides corresponded to genes with an erroneously identified start codon, and two were the n-terminal peptides of the newly annotated genes, spoa_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig>  identified in this work . these data reveal that almost 13% of the cdss annotated at the primary stage  <cit>  could have a wrongly identified start codon. as expected, the ratio of initiator codons is usual for bacteria: atg , gtg  and ttg . over 87%  of the wrongly annotated cdss were shorter than previously annotated. this was as expected and is probably due to the glimmer annotation system used, which tends to privilege annotation producing the longest possible sequence.

seeding proteogenomic annotation for the whole roseobacter clade
an ortho-proteogenomic analysis was carried out in order to extend the genomic re-annotations proposed for r. pomeroyi to the thirty-six other sequenced roseobacter members. for this, we performed a local tblastn to search for homologues of the thirty-nine new genes  among the other thirty-six sequenced roseobacter genomes. table  <dig> compiles the eight homologous regions found that were not previously annotated as cdss in their respective genomes. six of these homologues belong to highly conserved genes and, as for r. pomeroyi, were simply missed during annotation. interestingly, the novel identified targets, spo_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig>  showed a distant homologue in another roseobacter strain , meaning that these are no longer unique to r. pomeroyi.

the confidently detected n-terminal sequences of the  <dig> cdss listed in additional file  <dig> were used to check whether some of their homologues found in the other sequenced roseobacter strains had been wrongly annotated. for this, a local tblastn analysis with the  <dig> protein sequences was performed for all the annotated cdss of each of the thirty-six sequenced roseobacters. a total of  <dig> polypeptides sharing high similarities with these r. pomeroyi polypeptides were found and are listed in additional file  <dig>  the sequence and position of the first sixty amino acids of the alignment are also shown. in most cases, a consensus between the identified start codon of the r. pomeroyi protein and its respective homologue in other roseobacter members was observed. nevertheless, in  <dig> cases the position of the most-n-terminal sequence annotated was not in agreement with the n-terminus of the r. pomeroyi protein. for all of these, we propose the correction of the annotation after manual inspection. we checked whether the new gene starts corresponded to a canonical initiation codon  and, in the case of a sequence extension at the n-terminus, if there was evidence of sequence similarities with the r. pomeroyi polypeptide. the rate of erroneously identified start codons among the roseobacter genomes was 11% . of note, this value may be an underestimate because i) we discarded many doubtful corrections during manual inspection, and ii) most of the blast results mainly matched highly conserved genes that are generally better annotated by comparative genomics. the rate decreased to  <dig> % when considering only those curated genomes .

defining operonic structures with re-annotated genes
we found that some loci comprise several annotation errors. for example, figure 2panel b shows the locus where the two novel genes, spo_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig>  are encoded. as these two genes are equally oriented as the rpse and rpmd genes, both encoding conserved ribosomal proteins, we checked whether an operonic structure could be identified. we purified rna from cells where the two proteins had been detected, and amplified specific cdna fragments by rt-pcr . we found that the two genes are co-transcribed, as we obtained rt-pcr amplification of the spo_pg027-spo_pg <dig> region. despite this, no amplification could be obtained between this operon and its downstream rplo or upstream rpmd genes. the latter result was expected because of a putative rho-independent transcriptional terminator identified by the transterm software .

the neighbouring genes in the operon structures of the newly annotated cdss may infer plausible hints about the functions of the novel detected genes. this is the case for spo_pg <dig>  which we have shown here to be co-transcribed with the spo_ <dig> gene. we have previously shown that the latter encodes an rtx-like toxin which is abundantly secreted in the culture medium  <cit> . rtx operons always comprise the toxin gene itself together with other genes involved in toxin activation and export  <cit> . spo_pg <dig> could be involved in such activation or export functions. spo_pg <dig> is also part of a putative rtx-like operon. we detected, by rt-pcr amplification, an operon structure comprising this gene and its flanking spo_ <dig> and spo_ <dig> genes. spo_ <dig> shows sequence similarities with calcium-binding rtx toxins. this protein has a putative signal peptide for export as identified by the signalp predictor software  <cit> .

rt-pcr amplification was also performed for the spo_pg <dig> and spo_ <dig> couple, possibly with a linked function. spo_ <dig>  a signal-recognition, particle-docking protein, is located just upstream of spo_pg <dig>  another operon structure detected was that of spo_pg <dig> with the upstream spo_2211-spo_2212-spo_ <dig> genes. these three genes encode the determinants of branched-chain amino acid catabolism . spo_pg <dig> shows similarities with only a few proteins found in other roseobacter members . the loci encoding these far-homologues are also located close to genes with functions related to branched-chain amino acid metabolism. however, the genomic context is not always similar to that found in r. pomeroyi. on the other hand, we found that spo_pg <dig> is co-transcribed with its downstream gene, spo <dig>  and upstream gene, spo <dig>  a putative propionyl-coa carboxylase. spo <dig> converts propionyl-coa  to methylmalonyl-coa . strikingly, spo_pg <dig> shares similarity with one other annotated gene, in the roseobacter sp med <dig>  which also shows the same putative operon structure.

spo_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig>  shown in figure  <dig>  and spo_pg <dig>  are encoded in the close neighbourhood of the operon structures encoding essential enzymes of the central metabolic citric acid cycle in r. pomeroyi. interestingly, spo_pg <dig> and spo_pg <dig> were shown to be co-transcribed with the genes encoding these enzymes. spo_pg <dig>  which is co-transcribed with the spo_ <dig> gene , is independently transcribed from its flanking operons, succd and sucab . spo_pg <dig> belongs to the succd operon and is located between the succ and sucd genes. figure  <dig> shows the genomic context for the succdab genes for seven other rhodobacteraceae bacteria. the presence of additional cdss in the succd operon is exclusive to the roseobacter strains. conversely, the minimal structure observed in other rhodobacteraceae is the common rule amongst bacteria belonging to other clades . in all roseobacter species that were compared, we observed a variable pattern of novel genes inserted within the succd operon and in the intergenic region between sucab and succd. these novel genes are poorly conserved between the different roseobacter members, as shown in figure  <dig>  the gene encoding spo_pg <dig> is found inserted within the succinate dehydrogenase operon, sdhcdab. we demonstrated its co-transcription with its flanking genes, spo <dig> and spo <dig>  by a specific rt-pcr amplification. the presence of non-conserved genes included in the sdhcdab operon is also common amongst roseobacter members, but not in other bacteria.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
from the large dataset of ms/ms spectra  recorded for proteome samples of r. pomeroyi cultivated in various conditions, we identified thirty-nine newly annotated genes and nine wrongly described orfs. we also corrected seventy-four start codons and described five sequencing errors  that consequently modified the characteristics of the genes encoded at these loci. because of its environmental relevance, the roseobacter clade is currently subject to intense sequencing efforts  <cit> . however, because of the large diversity of this bacterial group, there are insufficient numbers of near-related genome sequences to improve their annotations by comparative genomics alone. here, we show the importance of proteogenomics input for a better characterization of bacterioplankton.

we noted that the number of annotation inaccuracies, in terms of structural annotation, is rather large for r. pomeroyi genome annotation. this is similar to previous proteogenomic reports for shewanella or mycobacterium bacteria that resulted in thirty-eight and twenty-nine new annotations, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, a recent proteogenomic study carried out on the enterobacterium yersinia pestis identified only four novel genes  <cit> . as enterobacteria are the most extensively studied organisms, and numerous genomes from the enterobacteriaceae family have now been sequenced and annotated, it is reasonable to consider that their genomes are amongst the best for accuracy and reliability. this is in full agreement with the proteogenomic data presented by payne et al.  <cit> . here we have shown that even highly expressed genes and operons with potentially important cellular roles were missed during the genome annotation of r. pomeroyi. the majority of annotation problems come from the identification of cdss exclusive to a small number of organisms, as comparative genomics is not useful in such a case in confirming the orf prediction. their validation requires additional experimental evidence, such as described here. blending data from complementary approaches, such as protein characterization by tandem mass spectrometry and transcriptomic evidence, is time consuming but results in stronger evidence for small genes. in terms of mass spectrometry, 'one-hit-wonders' are proteins identified with only one, non-redundant peptide tag. they are usually proteins with low molecular weight that are able to generate only a few tryptic peptides. depending on the score of ms/ms spectrum assignment, these hits may be difficult to ascertain confidently and require manual validation. gupta et al  <cit>  proposed a method to validate one-hit-wonders using comparative proteogenomics, but this requires the recording of various ms/ms datasets on several species. here, we used rt-pcr to detect the expression of several cdss identified with only one peptide. in this way we obtained evidence that the locus was being expressed, giving higher confidence to the assignment. this method proved to be effective, with the addition of five novel genes to our list.

another frequent problem encountered during genome annotation is the identification of a cds located in two different reading frames that clearly encodes a unique, conserved protein. this can be either a real frameshift process occurring for the regulation of protein synthesis, an artefact resulting from a sequencing error, or a pseudogene that has been recently inactivated. as we identified in the present study peptides in different reading frames at the same loci , we confirmed the production of the polypeptides encoded and discounted the existence of pseudogenes. we checked systematically the sequences of the five loci and found in all cases that the plausible frameshifts resulted from sequencing errors. the insertion of an extra nucleotide in the sequence produced a slippage of the coding region to another reading frame in the five cases. this was expected as frameshifts are rare processes of regulation and usually down-regulate the protein synthesis in bacteria, while they are frequent in archaea or viruses  <cit> . the number of sequencing errors found in the r. pomeroyi genome sequence also supports the current idea of re-sequencing genomes which were established a decade ago  <cit> . here we have confirmed the input of proteogenomics to indicate the specific loci that need such sequence re-evaluation which has already been highlighted by others  <cit> .

it is worth noting that ortho-proteogenomic extension of the corrected annotations to phylogenetically-related microorganisms reinforces the interest of proteogenomic studies for poorly studied bacterial phyla. ortho-proteogenomic analyses have, to date, been limited to only two genera, mycobacterium  <cit>  and yersinia  <cit> , and have not been extended beyond this taxonomic level. in the present work, we exploited the ms/ms data combined with comparative genomics to extend re-annotations for genomes from higher taxonomic ranks. although all sequenced members of the roseobacter clade are distantly related, they all form a robust cluster with a high rate of similarities at the 16s rna nucleotide sequence level  <cit> . we have successfully extended the identified n-terminal annotation of the  <dig> proteins detected in r. pomeroyi to  <dig> homologous genes in the thirty-six sequenced roseobacter isolates, corresponding to nineteen distinct genera. in this way,  <dig> genes that were wrongly annotated were confidently corrected. this represents 11% of the total number of orfs considered. to highlight the importance of manual curation of genome annotations, the rate of erroneous n-terminal identifications decreased to  <dig> % when considering only the four complete roseobacter genomes included in this study. these error rates are probably slightly underestimated as we only considered the conserved and obvious corrections. it is important to note that the full rate of badly annotated n-terminal genes established on the well-annotated genome of r. pomeroyi was  <dig> %. a more comprehensive annotation of the clade could only be accomplished by integrating a comparative proteogenomic analysis of various roseobacter strains, as previously carried out with the genus shewanella .

finally, the identification of operon structures by rt-pcr has given insights of the plausible function of the novel proteins identified in the present study. bacterial genomes are usually well structured and regulated in the form of operons. remarkably, we found that most of the novel, proteogenomic-detected cdss were identified in operons encoding catabolic functions for amino acid degradation, rtx-like secreted proteins or central citric cycle metabolism. because most of the biological conditions were carried out in a peptide broth  <cit> , this catabolism is privileged and such discovery may be advantaged. whether the genes encoded in the close neighbourhood of genes specifying rtx-like toxins are part of the protein secretion system or associated factors is an interesting question, as such toxins can be abundantly secreted, as previously shown  <cit> . moreover, we identified novel cdss with no ascribable function in operons encoding essential determinants of the citric acid cycle. these novel cdss are not at all conserved among other roseobacter members, but their presence is a common topic restricted to members of this clade. whether these genes encode proteins that enhance this central metabolic cycle in these bacteria or are opportunistic genes that specifically appear in this operon because of the advantage of their high expression is an open question. the presence of the novel proteins found in the citric acid cycle operon in r. pomeroyi could represent snapshots of how novel proteins with novel specific functions arise during evolution.

systematic listing of cdss in numerous microorganisms, with the help of proteogenomic evidence, should increase the accuracy of annotation software. as demonstrated here, proteogenomic evidences from bacteria belonging to orders that have, thus far, been poorly characterized, such as the roseobacter clade, are necessary to improve genome and even metagenome annotations. ortho-proteogenomic annotation extension to a whole bacterial clade has proven here to be highly valuable. such extension could also be applied to metagenome data, taking into account higher constraints.
