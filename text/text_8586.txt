BACKGROUND
the parasitic protozoan giardia intestinalis  is a common cause of water-borne diarrhoeal disease, particularly in the developing world. g. intestinalis's infective ingenuity stems from its ability to switch between two morphologically distinct states: an externally protected, inert cyst and a flagellated colonizing trophozoite that can attach to host cells in the small intestine. this attachment leads to the unpleasant symptoms associated with giardiasis  <cit> . differentiation of g. intestinalis has been studied extensively in terms of analysing the morphological events associated with encystation  and excystation   <cit> , yet little is known about the molecular circuitry that regulates differentiation. although limited in their number, a few studies have given some crucial insights into the intracellular signalling pathways that may allow the organism to respond to environmental cues. for instance, protein kinase a and cyclic-amp, in addition to calcium and calmodulin have been shown to play an important role in trophozoite motility and initiation of excystation  <cit>  while catalytically active homologs of the intracellular signalling mitogen-activated protein kinase family in g. intestinalis appear to be important for growth and encystation  <cit> . the potential diversity of intracellular signalling mechanisms in g. intestinalis is illustrated by the recent characterisation of a giardial protein kinase b-like molecule  <cit>  and by the demonstration that cholesterol starvation in vitro induces giardia encystation  <cit> . the latter suggests a role for lipids and lipid signalling in parasite differentiation.

phosphatidylinositol  is a basic building block for intracellular inositol lipids in eukaryotic cells and is present in trace amounts in g. intestinalis trophozoites and encysting cells cultured in vitro  <cit> . it has been shown that g. intestinalis uses inositol headgroup exchange enzymes to convert free inositol to ptdins  <cit> . in dictyostelium discoideum, yeast and mammalian cells, ptdins can be reversibly phosphorylated at the d- <dig> position of its inositol ring by phosphoinositide 3-kinases , and at other positions by distinct kinases, to form phosphorylated ptdins; ptdins and its phosphorylated derivatives are collectively referred to as phosphoinositides   <cit> . although pis constitute a minor fraction of total cellular lipids in eukaryotic cells, they are biologically important as second messengers and their levels must be accurately regulated  <cit> .

although ptdins has been detected in giardia  <cit>  it is unclear whether this parasite utilises pi3k-mediated intracellular signalling mechanisms to regulate its growth and differentiation. pi3k signalling is associated with many eukaryotic events such as regulation of cell growth, intracellular membrane trafficking and cell motility  <cit> , each of which is important in the lifecycle of g. intestinalis. pi3k signalling has been extensively characterised in mammals, yeast and most notably in the slime mold dictyostelium discoideum, where several pi3ks are known to be important for normal cell growth, multicellular development, aggregation and chemotaxis  <cit> .

pi3ks become activated in response to numerous agonists and the resulting pis initiate the recruitment of signalling proteins to membranes – specifically by way of pi-binding domains present on the proteins. in this way, membrane signals can be spatially restricted and highly controlled. a well-characterised example of a pi-binding signalling protein is protein kinase b , which, when membrane-recruited by pi, is only then able to phosphorylate specific substrates in order to regulate apoptosis, protein synthesis, cell growth and cell cycling  <cit> . to date, eight mammalian pi3ks have been identified and they comprise three classes of isozymes on the basis of sequence similarity and substrate preference in vivo  <cit> . class i pi3ks phosphorylate ptdins, ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig>  class ii pi3ks phosphorylate ptdins and ptdinsp but not ptdinsp <dig> and class iii pi3ks  exclusively phosphorylate ptdins. all pi3ks characterised to date have a multi-domain structure, comprising a highly conserved two-lobed catalytic kinase domain at their c-terminus, a pik domain which acts as a scaffold around which the enzyme is folded and a c <dig> or c2-like domain that in other proteins binds phospholipids and so may be involved in substrate targeting. the pi3ks also have domains that mediate enzyme activation and promote enzyme interaction with the plasma membrane, namely the ras binding domains  common to class i and ii isoforms, and adaptor protein binding domains  <cit> .

using mammalian and yeast pi3k protein sequences as queries, we searched the g. intestinalis genome  <cit>  to identify putative molecular homologues. here, we report on the characterisation of two giardial genes, which we term gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  encoding putative pi3ks. the presence of well conserved structural pi3k domains in these sequences and the detection of specific transcripts for both genes in trophozoites and encysting cells suggest that gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> are functional enzymes. functionality of at least one of the putative pi3ks is experimentally demonstrated by the specific and significant inhibitory effect of a pi3k inhibitor on trophozoite proliferation. we further substantiate the existence of pi3k signalling in g. intestinalis by identifying additional homologs which may be important for the metabolism and downstream effects of the giardial pi3k enzymatic products.

RESULTS
identification and sequence characterisation of two putative g. intestinalis pi3k genes
using catalytic domain sequences of class i, ii and iii pi3ks as query sequences, we carried out sequence similarity searches to identify giardia genes encoding putative pi3ks. our searches returned several open reading frames, two of which demonstrated similarity to pi3k genes  and were therefore called gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  the predicted open reading frames of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in length respectively. gipi3k <dig> is predicted to encode a  <dig>  amino acid protein  with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, whilst gipi3k <dig> is predicted to encode a  <dig>  amino acid protein  with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda. we independently confirmed the entire gipi3k <dig> sequence given by the g. intestinalis genome project,  and no differences in sequence were observed.

pi3k – characteristic domains were predicted to be present and in the typical conformation for both gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> . ubiquitin/rbd-like, c <dig>  pik and kinase domains were predicted for gipi3k <dig> with significant expectant  values . c <dig>  pik and kinase domains were predicted for gipi3k <dig>  again with significant e-values. interestingly, both putative kinase domains appeared to be interrupted by long insertions as compared with other well-studied pi3ks . we carried out sequence-similarity searches with the predicted ubiquitin/rbd-like domain of gipi3k <dig> which returned matches against the ras binding domains of several mammalian class i pi3ks . this finding is interesting, since g. intestinalis apparently contains no ras protein-encoding sequences  <cit> . a recent  g. intestinalis genome survey by us supports this claim: we could only identify putative rab, ran and rac gtpases encoded in the g. intestinalis genome  <cit> , but no ras-encoding sequences. one could speculate that the putative rbd of gipi3k <dig> may be recruited to membranes by another ras-like small gtpase such as rab.

full-length and domain-only sequence similarity analysis of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> demonstrated clear similarity with pi3ks from other organisms, in particular gipi3k <dig> is predicted to be similar to class i pi3ks and gipi3k <dig> to class iii pi3ks . due to low conservation of sequence similarity amongst c <dig> domains from various pi3ks, similar analysis carried out for the predicted c <dig> domains of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> did not return significant matches to the c <dig> domains of other pi3ks. however, c <dig> pairwise sequence alignments  demonstrated reasonable c <dig> domain similarity.

to further substantiate the identity of the giardial pi3k domains, pairwise alignments of the rbd of gipi3k <dig> and the c <dig> and pik domains of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> were carried out with pi3ks which shared the greatest similarity with the giardial pi3ks . figure  <dig> shows how the domains of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> align well with domains of pi3ks from d. discoideum and glycine max respectively.

a similar, detailed multiple alignment analysis was carried out for the kinase domains of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> against the structurally characterised kinase domain of pi3kγ  from the domestic pig, sus scrofa  <cit>  . all residues required for atp binding and kinase activity in the s. scrofa pi3kγ are conserved in both gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  however, gipi3k <dig> lacks one of the lysines thought to interact with the i-phosphate of pi substrate  and a lysine thought to act as a ligand for the 5-phosphate of pip <dig>   <cit> . in addition, gipi3k2's activation loop appears to be shorter. all of these features are common to other functional class iii pi3k isoforms such as d. discoideum ddpik <dig>  <cit> , which are thought to be specific for ptdins only since their short activation loops cannot accommodate the 4-phosphate of ptdinsp substrate  <cit> . gipi3k1's activation loop is similar in length to that of the s. scrofa pi3kγ. taken together, this analysis strongly suggests that gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> are functional pi3ks belonging to the class i and class iii isoforms respectively.

both the kinase domains of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> have long insertions  that do not align with sequences in the kinase domain of s. scrofa pi3kγ, and neither do they align with each other. the positions of these insertions are intriguing since they are close to the highly conserved catalytic loop residues, and appear to sit between the n- and c-terminal lobes of the predicted kinase domains . secondary structure predictions of the insertions indicate that they may fold into additional structures associated with the respective kinase domains. in silico three-dimensional structural sequence alignments using the structurally characterised s. scrofa pi3kγ as a template suggest that the insertions are probably surface-exposed with respect to the two lobes of the kinase domains, aligning to a coil between two alpha helices . thus, these putative domains could be accommodated without preventing the correct folding of the kinase domains and may not hinder substrate access. sequence similarity searches of the insertions did not yield any evidence in terms of predicting their biological role. multiple alignments with twenty-six class i and class iii pi3ks from different organisms indicated that the apparent insertions are a unique feature of the giardial sequences. these observations prompted speculation as to the nature of the insertions. because trophozoites undergo substantial morphological changes and alterations in gene expression  <cit>  the insertions could be subjected to differential splicing – perhaps as a way of controlling enzyme activity  <cit> . however, rt-pcr experiments using  <dig> hr encysting cell rna provided no evidence for the splicing of the insertion-encoding sequences of gipi3k <dig> or gipi3k <dig> rna during parasite differentiation .

phylogenetic analysis of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k2
phylogenetic analyses of the two putative giardial pi3ks clearly show their distinctive nature . gipi3k <dig> clusters with the well characterised d. discoideum pik <dig>  together, they are part of a clade exclusively containing pi3k <dig> homologs further strengthening our prediction that gipi3k <dig> is a class i isoform. the gipi3k <dig> sequence belongs to a well-supported clade containing only class iii homologs, in agreement with our prediction based on domain composition . although crown taxa fall in well-supported clades for the class iii homologs, support for the placement of the other sequences is lacking. the g. intestinalis class iii homolog is either basal to all other class iii homologs  or within the alveolates . the lengths of the branches leading to the g. intestinalis homologs are the longest in the analyses indicative of an accelerated evolution of these sequences. phylogenetic reconstruction artefacts such as long branch attraction  <cit>  are therefore expected to affect these analyses. this would most likely only affect the placement within the isoform clade but not across isoforms. therefore, our analyses cannot say much about the evolution of the g. intestinalis pi3ks but can be used to identify which isoform each sequence belongs to.

characterisation of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> gene products
rt-pcr analysis  demonstrated that gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> are both expressed in trophozoites and  <dig> hr encysting cells, suggesting they play an important role during growth and possibly during encystation. the predicted open reading frames of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> encode longer amino acid sequences as compared with other well-studied class i and iii pi3ks . to test the coding capacity of these genes, we probed northern blots of rna derived from trophozoites and  <dig> hr encysting cells with sequences specific to the highly conserved kinase domain-encoding region of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  we were unable to detect gipi3k <dig> mrna despite using control probes against well-characterised giardial transcripts to confirm rna integrity . this may indicate that the gipi3k <dig> message is relatively unabundant, detectable only by sensitive techniques such as rt-pcr. the apparent gipi3k <dig> mrna transcript detected by northern blotting  was smaller than expected based on the predicted size of the gipi3k <dig> open reading frame:  <dig>  –  <dig> kb as opposed to ~ <dig>  kb. subsequent 5'race experiments  indicated that three transcriptional initiation sites of the gipi3k <dig> gene may exist, capable of producing transcripts of ~ <dig>  kb, ~5kb, and ~ <dig>  kb in length, assuming they shared a common 3' polyadenylation site. a typical giardial polyadenylation site conforming to the consensus agtpuraapyr  <cit>  for the gipi3k <dig> gene was found , however putative polyadenylation sites for gipi3k <dig> could not be identified. the shortest gipi3k <dig> 5'race product could represent the gipi3k <dig> transcript detected by northern blotting. this suggests that the major transcript of the gipi3k <dig> gene would encode a product more akin to the molecular weights observed for other well-studied pi3ks  <cit> , although it would lack the potential rbd. this may imply the existence of protein products which not only differ in size but also in the way in which they are regulated. the rbd of a class i pi3k has been shown to stimulate the pi3k's kinase activity in addition to stabilising its association with the plasma membrane  <cit> . thus gipi3k <dig> protein products with an rbd may display differences in activity and/or localisation compared to those without an rbd.

possible giardial promoter-like elements found upstream from each of the three alternative gipi3k <dig> transcripts are also indicated in figure  <dig>  promoter elements in g. intestinalis tend to have a relatively loose consensus, however it is generally thought that an at-rich initiator of 8– <dig> bp exists near the transcription/translation start site in addition to a longer at-rich element further upstream from the transcriptional start site which may contain caat boxes  <cit> . it is interesting that the apparent promoters of all three gipi3k <dig> transcripts have some or all of these features. in addition, the shortest transcript is the only one to have upstream caat boxes. possibly the 'loose' molecular machinery controlling giardial transcription  <cit>  could be responsible for the presence of three gipi3k <dig> transcripts, whereby transcription is initiated at several at-rich regions. the use of specific antibodies against gipi3k <dig> will be required to clarify whether the transcripts encode multiple proteins with distinct functions.

effect of pi3k inhibition on trophozoite proliferation
to determine the functional role of putative pi3ks in g. intestinalis growth, we applied a commonly used pi3k inhibitor, ly <dig>  on g. intestinalis trophozoites. we tested a range of concentrations around those shown to selectively inhibit mammalian pi3ks  <cit> . figure 8a shows a dose-response of exponentially growing cells to the inhibitor, with concentrations of ly <dig> as low as  <dig> μm causing a significant inhibitory effect on cell number as compared with the untreated control. approximately 50% inhibition of cell proliferation occurred at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm. this effect is likely to be pi3k-mediated, since ly <dig> concentrations within the  <dig> –  <dig> μm range have been employed for selective pi3k inhibition in mammalian cells. to understand the time course over which ly <dig> exhibited its effects, we counted  <dig> μm ly <dig> – treated cells at regular intervals over a  <dig> hour period. figure 8b demonstrates that ly <dig> begins to significantly effect cell number  <dig> hours into treatment. for the duration of the time-course, cell number remains approximately constant, whilst the untreated control continues to grow exponentially. this suggests that ly <dig> may affect cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest. in addition, trophozoites treated with ly <dig> do not undergo any dramatic changes in their morphology or motility, thus further demonstrating the selective effect of ly <dig> on giardia's cell cycle.

to ensure that the effects of ly <dig> were due to inhibition of one or more of the putative pi3ks and not another target, such as the casein kinase ii  protein which can also be inhibited by ly <dig>  <cit> , we tested the effect of the ckii-inhibitor, drb , on trophozoite proliferation. putative giardial ckii may exist under the accession numbers xp_ <dig>  and eaa <dig> , although there is no experimental evidence for this inference. the use of drb at concentrations known to be inhibitory in mammalian cell types  <cit>  did not cause the same effect on cell proliferation as ly <dig> . this, coupled with the fact that relatively low concentrations of ly <dig> cause a significant decrease in cell number, strongly supports a specific effect on putative pi3ks. furthermore, this data suggests that trophozoite proliferation is dependent on the functionality of pi3k signalling.

discussion
our study has identified and characterised two putative and distinctive giardial pi3k-encoding genes and gene products. gipi3k <dig> is predicted to be a class i pi3k and gipi3k <dig> a class iii pi3k; both are predicted to be functional as pi3ks and both are expressed during normal growth and possibly during encystation. in addition, we have demonstrated that inhibition of putative giardial pi3ks by the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> causes a specific and significant inhibition of trophozoite proliferation.

interestingly, the pi3k inhibitor wortmannin did not effect trophozoite growth as ly <dig> did. this was despite our attempts to account for wortmannin instability  <cit>  by both testing the activity of our stock solutions on mammalian cell cultures to detect reduced phosphorylated pkb levels and by making repeated additions of the agent to trophozoite cultures . wortmannin-insensitive pi3ks have been described in yeast, where yeast vps <dig> is known to be 1200× less susceptible to wortmannin inhibition than its human homologue  <cit> . differences in sensitivity can be explained by differences in key atp/wortmannin-binding regions of the respective class iii isoforms  <cit> . analyses of the giardial pi3ks demonstrate that they too have residues that differ at the same positions described for yeast vps <dig>  for example, human vps <dig> and yeast vps <dig> differ at positions equivalent to positions ile- <dig> and gly- <dig> in the s. scrofa sequence in figure  <dig>  at these positions, the isoleucine is replaced by a leucine and the glycine replaced with a serine in both gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  these residue differences might explain giardia's apparent insensitivity to wortmannin. an alternative explanation is that the insertions located near to the active sites of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> somehow interfere with wortmannin binding, but not ly <dig> binding, since the inhibitory mechanisms of both inhibitors are quite distinct. wortmannin is an irreversible inhibitor that causes conformational changes to the pi3k active site, whereas ly <dig> is a reversible inhibitor that binds less deeply into the active site than wortmannin  <cit> . further analysis will be required to test the wortmannin sensitivity of purified giardial pi3ks.

the giardial pi3ks contain long insertions which effectively appear to separate the two lobes of their putative kinase domains. these insertions are unique to the giardial sequences and are likely to form part of the protein sequence, as they are not intron-derived. the reason for their existence is unknown, but could simply represent a peculiar feature of the evolutionarily distant/parasitically-divergent g. intestinalis. the presence of the giardial pi3k insertions further adds to the observation of relatively large insertions of unknown function found in protein kinases from other organisms such as plasmodium, leishmania and trypanosomes  <cit>  in addition to other giardial sequences  <cit> . insertions in giardial sequences have been suggested to serve as useful drug targets  <cit> . this is particularly relevant in the case of the giardial pi3ks identified here since pi3k activity in g. intestinalis is important for parasite proliferation. hence drugs that could selectively target giardial pi3ks on the basis of their insertion sequences would be highly desirable in terms of being parasite-specific and effective. current progress in designing pi3k-directed pharmacological agents  <cit>  suggests that this could be attainable in the future.

the identity of class i and class iii isoforms suggests that g. intestinalis is capable of pi-based signal transduction for a range of processes covering typical class i pi3k sites  and class iii pi3k sites . to understand the potential role of pi3k signalling in g. intestinalis in a broader context, we used sequence-similarity tools to identify additional giardial signalling homologues. figure  <dig> shows giardial proteins which could metabolise the putative products of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> in addition to other pi intermediates, starting with phosphatidylinositol which has already been found in g. intestinalis  <cit> . the pi-metabolising phosphatases identified include: a pi 5-phosphatase and a pten-like pi 3-phosphatase which may both act to dephosphorylate the likely products of gipi3k <dig> in addition to an mtm-like pi 3-phosphatase that could dephosphorylate the likely product of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  the pi-metabolising kinases identified include: a pipkin, or phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase of as yet unknown type which could phosphorylate several pi-intermediates, such as ptdinsp, ptdinsp <dig> and ptdinsp in addition to a putative pi- <dig> kinase to phosphorylate ptdins for the purpose of eventual ptdinsp <dig> generation. thus sequence analysis does support mechanisms for metabolising the products of the giardial pi3ks.

to predict how these products, ptdinsp, ptdinsp <dig> and ptdinsp <dig>  may act as effective second messengers for downstream effectors, we searched the g. intestinalis genome  <cit>  for proteins which have the relevant pi-binding domains such as phox-homology , fyve  and pleckstrin-homology . ph-domain containing proteins such as protein kinase b  use their ph domain to facilitate recruitment to the plasma membrane where ptdinsp <dig> is located. although kim et al.  failed to identify a ph domain in the giardial pkb, gipkb, with significant similarity to the ph domain of other pkbs, the percentage identity and similarity scores following our own sequence alignment of gipkb's putative ph domain with that of human pkb were  <dig> and  <dig> % respectively . thus it may be that gipkb is capable of binding ptdinsp <dig> via a putative divergent ph domain. another protein that binds ptdinsp <dig> via its ph domain is 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase- <dig>  which phosphorylates pkb. we were able to identify a putative giardial pdk <dig> homologue which did not have an easily identifiable ph domain when employing domain-prediction tools. however upon pairwise-alignment of its sequence with that of human pdk <dig>  a ph domain-like sequence was identified with  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity .

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the human intestinal parasite g. intestinalis encodes and expresses two putative pi3ks, gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  both of which are likely to be functional based on sequence analysis. functionality of pi3k-dependent processes has been demonstrated by observing the specific inhibitory effect of a pi3k-inhibitor on trophozoite proliferation. phylogenetic analysis supports the assignment of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> to the class i and class iii pi3k subdomains respectively, and in-depth sequence analysis further substantiates their proposed substrate specificities. genome sequence analysis can link the products of gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> with putative giardial pi-metabolising phosphatases and kinases, in addition to downstream effectors with pi-binding domains. this provides additional evidence for bona-fide pi3k signalling pathways in g. intestinalis.

a feature unique to both giardial pi3ks is the presence of a large insertion in a highly conserved region of their kinase domains. both insertions are not subject to splicing and are not predicted to interfere with substrate binding. thus, considering the important role of pi3ks for parasite proliferation, it is possible that the insertion sequences could be exploited for drug-targeting purposes.
