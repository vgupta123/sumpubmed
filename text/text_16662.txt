BACKGROUND
the macronutrient nitrogen  is an essential component of numerous important compounds, including amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, chlorophyll, and some plant hormones. this element is a major limiting factor in most agricultural systems. because the n-utilization efficiency strongly influences crop productivity, a vast amount of n fertilizers is applied to maximize yields. however, it is estimated that more than half of that n is lost from the plant–soil system, with unused n fertilizers severely polluting the environment  <cit> . thus, n-uptake efficiency must be increased to improve productivity and reduce pollution.

during periods of n-starvation, various deficiency-responsive genes function to support plant survival by increasing the level of chlorophyll synthesis  <cit> , altering root architecture  <cit> , improving n-assimilation  <cit> , enhancing lignin content  <cit> , and changing the amounts of sugars and sugar phosphates  <cit> . nitrate transporter genes  are responsible for the high-affinity no3− transport system and stimulate lateral root growth. arabidopsis nrt <dig>  plays a major role in no3− uptake and determines root architecture by controlling lateral root formation  <cit> . the ammonia transporter gene atamt <dig> , which is highly expressed in the roots, also restructures this architecture under limited-n conditions  <cit> . the plant-specific dof <dig> transcription factor  from maize also functions to increase n-assimilation  <cit> . in dof1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants, genes are up-regulated under n-starvation to encode enzymes for carbon skeleton production  <cit> . those transgenic plants also show markedly elevated amino acid contents, reduced levels of glucose, and improved growth during periods of n-deficient stress  <cit> . overexpression of glutaminesynthetase <dig> in tobacco and maize is associated with significant gains in plant heights, dry weights, and kernel numbers  <cit> . overexpression of nadh-glutamatesynthase in rice and alanine aminotransferase in canola and rice also causes increases in grain weights  <cit>  and biomass  <cit> . an early nodulin gene, osenod93- <dig>  responds to both increases and reductions in n supplies. furthermore, transgenic rice plants over-expressing osenod93- <dig> have greater shoot dry biomass and seed yields  <cit> .

microarray analyses have been conducted to investigate genome-wide gene expression in response to changes in n conditions. wang et al.  <cit>  studied gene responses in arabidopsis plants that were first grown for  <dig> d with ammonium as the sole n source, then treated with 250 mm nitrate for 20 min. that analysis identified  <dig>  nitrate-responsive genes in the roots and  <dig> in the shoots. peng et al.  <cit>  monitored expression profiles from arabidopsis plants grown under nitrate-limiting or -sufficient conditions. there, n-starvation altered transcript levels for  <dig> genes, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. palenchar et al.  <cit>  identified over  <dig> genes regulated by interactions between carbon and n signaling in arabidopsis. bi et al.  <cit>  detected differential expression of genes under mild or severe chronic n stress. plant responses were much more pronounced under severe conditions.

with ‘minghui 63’ rice, lian et al.  <cit>  applied est microarrays to examine expression profiles under low-n stress. in seedling roots,  <dig> responsive genes were identified, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. beatty et al.  <cit>  generated transgenic rice plants that overexpress alanine aminotransferase. comparisons of transcriptomes between the transgenic plants and controls revealed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of those genes were differentially regulated in the roots and shoots, respectively. cai et al.  <cit>  analyzed the dynamics of the rice transcriptome at 1 h, 24 h, and  <dig> d after n-starvation treatment. in all,  <dig>  genes were identified, with most being transiently responsive to such stress.

xu et al.  <cit>  performed a genome-wide investigation to detect mirnas that responded to either chronic or transient nitrate-limiting conditions in maize. they identified mirnas showing overlapping or unique responses as well as those that were tissue-specific. humbert et al.  <cit>  reported that the concomitant presence of n and a water deficit affected expression much more than was anticipated in maize. this research group also revealed how the interaction between those two stresses shaped patterns of expression at different levels of water stress as well as during the recovery period. finally, brouillette and donovan  <cit>  identified five genes that had markedly different responses to nitrogen limitations in helianthus anomalus when compared with h. petiolaris and h. annuus.

although microarray analyses have been extensively used for the past few decades, rna-seq analysis can more precisely measure transcript levels and allow for the absolute quantification of gene expression. however, rna-seq has not previously been employed to investigate n-deficiency-induced genes. here, we report transcriptome profiles for  <dig>  n-starvation-responsive genes from rice for which expression was altered in the roots or shoots due to an n-limitation.

RESULTS
rna-seq analysis of n-deficiency stress-responsive genes
through microarray analyses, early-responsive genes have been detected in rice roots but not in leaves when sampled after 20 min, 1 h, and 2 h of n-starvation  <cit> . cai et al. have monitored such genes after long-term  treatments with limited-n  <cit> .

to identify additional responsive genes, we transferred rice seedlings at the six-leaf stage to an n-deficient hydroponic solution. leaf sheaths and roots were harvested after 3 h, 6 h, 12 h,  <dig> d, and  <dig> d. we used two previously identified n-starvation-induced genes -- nrt <dig>  and amt <dig>  -- to investigate induction kinetics . in both sheaths and roots, transcript levels were increased upon starvation, peaking at 12 h before declining to basal levels after  <dig> d. this trend was consistent with earlier reports  <cit> . therefore, we selected the 12-h point for rna-seq analyses to distinguish between our results and those of studies that had investigated only very early- or late-responsive genes. because expression of stress-responsive genes is mostly transient, we believed our data would be valuable for finding a new class of n-starvation-responsive genes. leaf sheaths and roots were harvested from plants grown under deficient or sufficient conditions. rt-pcr analyses were used to determine the response of several n-metabolism genes, including osamt <dig> , osamt <dig> , osamt <dig> , osamt <dig> , osnar <dig> , osnr, osnrt <dig> , osnrt <dig> , ospepc, and osasn. significant changes in expression were revealed in the 12-h n-deficient samples .figure  <dig>

 were used to investigate induction kinetics.
analyses of n-metabolism genes by rt-pcr.  transcript levels of osamt <dig> , osamt <dig> , osamt <dig> , osnar <dig> , osnr, and osnrt <dig>  were measured in leaf sheaths sampled from seedlings grown under n-sufficient  or -deficient  conditions.  transcript levels of osamt <dig> , osnr, osnrt <dig> , osasn, and ospepc were measured in roots sampled from seedlings grown under n+ or n- conditions. levels were relative amounts against osubi expression.



we constructed eight cdna libraries from two biological replicates of leaf sheaths and roots from plants grown under deficient or sufficient conditions. sequencing those libraries resulted in the identification of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads  from the sheaths and roots, respectively. the generated reads were then aligned to the rice genome   <cit>  by applying bowtie  <cit>  and tophat <dig> programs  <cit> . in all, 86% of the reads from the sheaths and 69% from the roots were mapped to the reference genome, for which nearly 87% were correctly aligned and approximately 98% of them had unique locations in that genome .table  <dig>

transcript profiles of the rna-seq data were analyzed by calculating the reads per kilo base per million reads . the sequenced rna covered  <dig>  annotated genes, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of those genes in the sheaths and roots, respectively. in addition,  <dig>  novel transcripts were detected. transcripts with low rpkm values were removed because they may not have been reliable due to low abundance or statistical faults. among the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  had rpkm ≥  <dig>  of those,  <dig>  were present in the leaf sheaths,  <dig>  in the roots, and  <dig>  in both. we identified  <dig>  transcripts that were uniquely expressed in the sheaths  or roots .

among the transcriptionally active transcripts, the top  <dig> most highly expressed were identified from the leaf sheath  and roots  under n-limited conditions. in both organ types, the most frequent transcripts functioned for protein synthesis, protein degradation, photosynthesis, stress responses, tfs, and dna synthesis. transcripts involved in lipid metabolism, transport, secondary metabolism, and amino acid metabolism were also common.

differential expression of transcripts due to n-deficiency
comparing transcript abundances revealed  <dig>  transcripts that were differentially expressed  due to a deficient n supply . among them,  <dig>  were differentially expressed in the leaf sheaths and  <dig> in the roots. of those identified in the n-deficient sheaths,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated. in the n-deficient roots,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. to gain insight into the effect of n status on transcript expression profiles, we illustrated expression patterns with a heat map obtained via hierarchical cluster analysis . this clustering revealed the relatedness of the various transcripts.

transcription factors are important for controlling the expression of other genes. several tfs have been described in plants exposed to limited n. for example, an r2r3-type myb tf, cmmyb <dig>  is a central regulator of n-assimilation in cyanidioschyzon merolae and enhances the expression of cmnrt, cmnar, cmnir, cmamt, and cmgs under n-starvation  <cit> . a member of the arabidopsis gata tf gene family, at5g <dig>  is inducible by nitrate; loss-of-function mutants cause reduced chlorophyll levels and downregulation of the genes involved in carbon metabolism  <cit> . in arabidopsis, anr <dig> encodes a mads box protein and is induced by nitrate. when expression of this gene is suppressed, lateral root proliferation is altered due to a reduction in sensitivity to no3−  <cit> . of the  <dig>  transcripts that we found differentially expressed under an n-deficiency,  <dig> were identified as tfs, covering  <dig> families . this included one tf each from the gata, dof, and mads families. the ap2/erebp and wrky tf families are the two largest families responsive to this deficiency. here, six ap2/erebp tf members were increased in the sheaths and seven in the roots under stress. twelve wrky members were induced in the sheaths versus none in the roots. it will be valuable in future investigations to determine whether these tfs also play a critical role in the n-starvation response and plant development.table  <dig>

we classified the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes into  <dig> functional groups by go analysis . the dominant terms were ‘cell part’  in cellular component, ‘binding’  in molecular function, and ‘cellular process’  in biological process. in the third category, more than 30% of the genes for ‘metabolic process’ , ‘response to stimulus’ , and ‘biological regulation’  responded to n-starvation. ‘cellular process’ accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the starvation-related genes in the leaf sheath and root, respectively. ‘metabolic process’ genes made up  <dig> % and 53% in the sheath and root, respectively; while those proportions were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for ‘response to stimulus’ and  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for ‘biological regulation’.figure  <dig>

confirmation by real-time pcr
our rna-seq data appeared to be quite reliable for genes up-regulated by n-starvation, with  <dig> of the  <dig> deficiency-responsive genes first identified via rna-seq analyses subsequently being confirmed by qrt-pcr . only two could not be verified in that latter examination. by contrast, the identification of down-regulated genes by rna-seq was less reliable. among  <dig> examined, eight were later confirmed through qrt-pcr .table  <dig>

validation by gus assays
we used gus assays of t-dna gene trap lines to confirm the n-starvation-responsive tf genes. those tagging lines were previously generated to have a translational fusion between the tagged gene and gus  <cit> . five gus-positive lines displayed n-responsive gus activity. although this activity was weak when plants were grown in a standard n-sufficient medium, it was rapidly induced by n-starvation. under low-n conditions, four lines  showed preferential gus-staining in the sheaths  while one  showed staining in the roots  . in all five lines, gus activity was higher for plants in the low-n medium than in the normal ms medium. the os01g <dig> and os11g <dig> genes encode a wrky tf, os12g <dig> encodes a myb tf, os03g <dig> encodes a bhelix-loop-helix tf, and os02g <dig> encodes the trihelix tf gtl <dig>  although the t-dna vectors carry an intron with triple splicing donors/acceptors at the right border, only one pair of donors and acceptors is utilized that reduces the frequency of translational fusion between the tagged gene and gus  <cit> . nonetheless, the gus-trapped tf lines are valuable for investigating their roles during n-starvation.figure  <dig>

analysis of alternative splicing
alternative splicing  is an important regulatory mechanism common in higher eukaryotes that results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins, thereby enhancing biological diversity  <cit> . its products are efficiently identified using high-throughput sequencing techniques  <cit> . to investigate potential splicing junctions, we performed computational analyses that revealed  <dig>  multi-exonic genes with  <dig>  as events . these events were categorized into six common types. ‘intron retention’ was the dominant type , which is consistent with previous observations from plants  <cit> . by contrast, ‘exon skipping’ is the most prevalent mechanism in humans and yeast  <cit> . here, ‘alternative 3’ site’, ‘exon skipping’, and ‘alternative first exon’ accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, of all events. frequencies were relatively low for ‘alternative 5’ site’  and ‘alternative last exon’  . these data were consistent with other recent reports for plants  <cit> . an example of the transcript isoforms is shown in figure 5b.figure  <dig> 
analysis of alternative splicing.  left,  <dig> types of as events; right, total numbers of events, including annotated and newly identified splicings.  example of ntr . four types of as events are indicated. blue frame, ‘intron retention’; red, ‘alternative first exon’; pink, ‘5′ site’; and green, ‘skipped exon’.



alternative splicing can occur because of environmental factors. for example, expression of wdreb <dig> is activated by cold, drought, salt, or exogenous aba treatment; depending upon the source of the stress, three transcript forms may be produced  <cit> . however, we found no significant difference in as between n-sufficient and -deficient conditions, which suggests that it is not involved in the low-n stress response.

novel transcribed regions  validated by rt-pcr
rna-seq technology has revealed novel transcripts that could not be identified previously  <cit> . our rna-seq data contained  <dig>  novel transcribed regions, of which  <dig> were regulated under the n-deficiency. to confirm their existence, we conducted semi-quantitative reverse transcription pcr with  <dig> ntrs . among them,  <dig>  were detected in the leaf sheath and  <dig> of those  <dig>  showed expression patterns consistent with the sequencing data. the three exceptions, with inconsistent patterns, were ntr- <dig>  ntr- <dig>  and ntr- <dig> figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we performed deep transcriptomic investigations with rice plants and obtained detailed expression profiles for genes involved in responses to low-n stress. these data provide valuable information about the genes  induced by n-starvation, expecially the  <dig> tfs that are key regulators of growth and development. we then confirmed these rna-seq data by conducting qrt-pcr and gus assays of t-dna tagging lines. in all,  <dig>  multi-exonic genes could be linked with  <dig>  as events. however, we found no significant difference in alternative splicing between n-deficient samples and controls. our data will be useful for identifying n-deficiency-induced genes and investigating the signal transduction pathway of n-utilization.
