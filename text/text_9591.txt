BACKGROUND
micrornas are small non-coding rnas ~22 nt which are involved in key biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and metabolism  <cit> . aberrant expression level of micrornas has been demonstrated to be associated with common diseases and human cancers  <cit> . micrornas achieve their biological function by binding to mature mrnas and decreasing the expression level of target mrnas in most cases. mechanisms behind microrna target recognition have been well-studied, and the most stable feature is the nucleotides 2– <dig> in 5′-end of micrornas, which is so-called ‘seed’ region. normally, seed region of a microrna exactly matches to the complementary sequence in 3′utr of its target mrna, which is usually called ‘microrna recognition element seed site’  following watson-crick base pairing. snps in both microrna seed region and 3′utr mress can interfere with target recognition, either by eliminating/impairing/consolidating an existing microrna-mrna interaction or by creating a new interaction. however, in view of the observations that one microrna can regulate hundreds of mrnas and one mrna may have multiple microrna target sites in its 3′utr , snps residing in the 3′utr mresss should be the more common genetic factor affecting the binding between micrornas and mrnas. allele-specific mrna expression induced by mress snps is proved to be associated with several diseases and cancers: nicoloso et al.  <cit>  observed genotype ag carriers of rs <dig> g > a suffered higher risk of breast cancer , whereas rs <dig> located in a mress of mir-628-5p in 3′utr of the tgfbr <dig> gene and g-allele consolidates target-binding. expression level of tgfbr <dig> protein degraded after transfecting of mir-628-5p and differed by genotype of rs <dig> . wang et al.  <cit>  reported rs <dig> c > t in a mress of mir- <dig> in the 3′utr of fgf <dig> gene as a causal snp of parkinson’s disease . risk allele t can introduce a g:u wobble in the binding site and impair target binding. they transfected luciferase reporter gene combined with 3′utr of fgf <dig> into neuro2a cells that expressed mir- <dig>  and observed a ‘dramatically’ reduction of luciferase signal for reporter gene with c-allele while reporter gene with t-allele did not. pathological analysis reveals positive correlation between expression level of fgf <dig> and α-synuclein, whereas overexpression of α-synuclein is previously reported to cause pd, which implies pathogenesis of the t-allele is to abolish the interaction between fgf <dig> gene and mir- <dig> thus lead to up-regulation of α-synuclein.

about 60% of protein-coding genes are putative microrna targets  <cit>  and millions of mresss may reside in 3′utr of these genes, which makes exhaustively experimental validation for the causality of mress snps impractical. some researchers have tried using genome-wide association study  to solve this problem, taking advantage of its ability to detect susceptibility of hundreds of thousands of snps simultaneously. richardson et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> mress snps in strong linkage disequilibrium   with a collection of highly susceptible snps  in nhgri gwas catalog  <cit> . significance of the observation was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  further analysis provided microrna-mrna co-expression evidence for  <dig> of these mress snps and  <dig> were also supported by eqtl mapping. thomas et al.  <cit>  proposed a method to score the effect of mress snps basing on a two-step svm classifier and took haplotype into account. they linked scored mress snps to  <dig> top-ranking snps from a gwas of breast cancer by ld and observed positive correlation between effect score and ld degree. liu et al.  <cit>  developed an online database to annotate predicted mress snps. they searched a list of  <dig> susceptible snps obtained by a gwas of schizophrenia against the mress snps collected by their database. three meet stringent significance threshold of p ≤  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  which indicated true positive association existed in mress.

despite the achievements have obtained in previous studies, limitations still remain to be improved. existing methods only focus on the subset of mress snps with p-value less than a stringent multiple-testing corrections threshold  in gwas datasets in order to control false positive results. however, many true positive results will be eliminated in exchange. in addition, biological context of mress snps such as the pathogenesis of their host genes and corresponding micrornas have been neglected. a mress snp with just an extremely significant p-value or a high effect score does not necessarily work by interfering with microrna targeting. similarly, a mress snp that disrupts target recognition may not be very striking in statistics. moreover, previous studies covered only a few gwas datasets  at a time. the feasibility of selecting causal mress snps by gwas analysis  still needs to be tested under more gwas datasets. here, we proposed a method which integrated gwas p-value, gene ontology  annotation and pathogenesis of human disease to select causal mress snps without performing multiple-testing corrections. the method was applied to  <dig> gwas datasets covering  <dig> common diseases and cancers of human. results demonstrated mress snps are active disease regulators in most of the gwas datasets. literature-based causality query, co-expression evidence and alternation of binding free energy also proved that our method is plausible. finally, a list of  <dig> candidate causal mress snps with adequate credibility was provided for further experimental validation. about 90% of them were newly reported.

RESULTS
mresss in 3′utr of coding-mrnas are under purifying selection
evolutionary conserved regions are thought to be functional, and the conservation of microrna targets has been reported  <cit> . previous studies always compared the snp density of mresss with their flanking region, but horizontal comparison between mress and other mrna region, such as cds, has not been implemented. moreover, they took all snps into account at a time. however, common snps  ≥  <dig> ) and rare snps  affected human diseases in different patterns  <cit> . it’s more rational to calculate the density of these two kinds of snps separately. we collected experimentally validated microrna-mrna interactions from mirecord  <cit>  and mirtarbase  <cit> , and predicted their mresss in 3′utr by targetscan <dig>   <cit> . obtaining mresss were thought to be adequately credible. then, we mapped genomic coordinates of all the bi-allelic snps in dbsnp <dig> to that of the predicted mresss and thus calculated snp density. we detected  <dig> mress snps in total, comprising of  <dig> snps lacking population frequency,  <dig> common snps and  <dig> rare snps . distinct results emerged for common snps and rare snps after comparison of snp density in different mrna regions . on the one hand, the density of common snps in mresss was significantly less than that of the 3′utrs and the 5′utrs, even as low as that of the cdss, which indicated mresss were highly conserved. on the other hand, the density of rare snps in mress was very close to that of the 3′utrs and the 5′utr. the contrast of densities between common and rare mress snps demonstrated mresss were under strong purifying selection and mress snps were deleterious.figure  <dig> 
comparisons of the snp density between different mrna regions grouped by global maf. snps with global maf ≥  <dig>  are defined as common snps, the rest are rare snps. the figure illustrates that the mress region has a significantly lower common snp density but almost the same rare snp density compared to the utr regions, which indicates the mress region is under strong purifying selection. .



mress snps interfere with microrna-regulated human diseases
association between microrna and human disease was established if aberrant microrna expression presented in patient group. since most mress snps were embedded in 3′utr of mature mrnas but not genomic regions associated with microrna biogenesis, they should not be the principal factors behind abnormal microrna expressions. however, micrornas regulated human diseases by interacting with mrnas ultimately. therefore association between microrna and human disease can be converted to association between microrna-mrna interaction and human disease, giving mress snps the potential to affect microrna-regulated human diseases. based on this assumption, we generated trilateral interactions for microrna, gene and disease, including microrna-gene interactions obtained from mirecord and mirtarbase, microrna-disease interactions obtained from hmdd database  <cit>  and gene-disease interactions obtained from pubmed . for all the established trilateral interactions, we believed that the microrna-gene interactions are disease-related since both part of the interaction were associated with the same disease. finally, we constructed association between  <dig> validated microrna-gene interactions and  <dig> human diseases.  <dig> mress snps have the potential to affect these interactions and thus lead to disease. we searched the  <dig> mress snps in pubmed and  <dig> had been reported to be deleterious. reported diseases associated with these  <dig> mress snps were highly concordant with those associated with their microrna-mrna interactions , which supported our assumption that mress snps can interfere with microrna-regulated human diseases.figure  <dig> 
schematic diagram for the construction of the microrna-gene-disease three-way interactions. ways to build up relationships between any  <dig> of the  <dig> elements are marked above the double-headed arrows. if a microrna and a gene share the same related disease, we believe that their interaction is also associated with the disease, and any factor such as mress snp that can interfere with this interaction is highly susceptible.

gwas analysis reveals enrichment of mress snps in susceptible variants
experimentally validated microrna-mrna interactions account for only a small part of the real relationships. so we performed a genome-wide target prediction to identify more possible mress snps in 3′utr of protein-coding mrnas. we predicted mress for both wild type and mutant type 3′utr sequences and divided all of them into 7mer , 7mer , 8mer-1a and 8mer sites by the patterns of seed match. only mresss conserved between human and mice were retained to limit false positive interactions. finally,  <dig>  3′utr snps embedded in predicted mresss were classified according to their contributions to the interactions .table  <dig> 
classification of the  <dig>  predicted mress snps




to evaluate the effects of these predicted mress snps on human diseases, we downloaded the analytical results of  <dig> gwas datasets of european-ancestry populations covering  <dig> human diseases and cancers. we utilized the ‘proxy search’ tool provided by snap database  <cit>  to select gwas-snps having high ld with the predicted mress snps in ceu population, then assigned the p-values of gwas-snps to their corresponding mress snps as measurement of susceptibility. finally, a total number of  <dig>  predicted mress snps were mapped to at least one gwas-snp in any of the  <dig> datasets and presented in subsequent analysis. according to the hypothesis of ‘common disease, common variant’, common diseases are polygenic diseases manipulated by multiple common variants embedded in coding or regulatory regions. therefore the effect size of a single causative variant should be modest  <cit> . in addition, microrna regulations are spatio-temporal specific, which means only a part of the microrna-mrna interactions are active in the diseased tissue. taking these two points into consideration, we assumed that p-values of the mress snps are enriched in the susceptible part of each of the gwas datasets if true association existed, but majority of the functional mress snps would not meet stringent multiple-correction threshold because of their modest effective size. to validate our assumption, we drew quantile-quantile plot for each of the  <dig> gwas datasets . in most of the  <dig> datasets, obviously upward deviation from theoretical distribution at the right side was observed, and only  <dig> mress snps had –log <dig> larger than  <dig>  which is a general threshold of significance in gwas, demonstrating the reasonability of our assumption.figure  <dig> 
quantile-quantile plot for mress snps in all the  <dig> gwas datasets. the units for both x-axis and y-axis are –log <dig>  we can observe upward deviation from the red line in most of the subplot, which is the clue for true positive signals, and imply mress snps as common factors involved in multiple diseases and cancers.



gwas p-value combined with biological context identifies hundreds of candidate causal mress snps
we have discovered a hint for true association signals between mress snps and human diseases from the analysis above , and the next step is to distinguish them from background signals and filter out false positive. multiple-testing correction is not a good option because it impairs sensitivity greatly. mress snps have the potential to regulate microrna-induced mrna repression. if they are embedded in functional genes which act on interested disease, the positive signals should be more credible, and a moderate p-value threshold should meet the needs. according to this guideline , we first set up a moderate significance threshold of p ≤  <dig>  and selected out  <dig>  mress snps. next, we conducted go-term enrichment for the  <dig>  host genes of these mress snps in each of the gwas datasets and got  <dig> lists of enriched biological processes. meanwhile, we collected disease-related genes for each of the gwas datasets from ctd  <cit> , kegg  <cit>  and gene card  <cit>  and also got  <dig> lists of enriched biological processes. at last, we did one-by-one comparison between the two sets of lists, found their degree of overlap remarkably higher than expected. for example, in dataset phs <dig> pha <dig> which is related to systemic lupus erythematous ,  <dig> genes contain at least one significant mress snps and are enriched in  <dig> biological processes, e.g. positive regulation of tissue remodeling , inflammatory response , b-cell activation  and t-cell activation . in these biological processes,  <dig> overlap with the enriched biological processes of genes that have been reported to be associated with sle. significance of this observation is  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  demonstrating the existence of the true association signals. we got similar results from  <dig> other gwas datasets except for a gwas dataset studied age-related macular degeneration .figure  <dig> 
workflow of our method for selecting candidate causal mress snps from multiple gwas datasets. we integrated functional annotations from go database to filter out false positive mress snps rather than to perform multiple-correction. the obtained causal snps are greatly increased. we further validated our results by three different approaches. the results proved our method stable and effective.


statistics of the  <dig> gwas datasets


‘#enriched go-terms’ denotes the number of enriched go-terms for the host genes of mress snps with p-value ≤  <dig>  in each dataset. ‘#disease-related go-terms’ denotes the number of enriched go-terms shared between the host genes and the disease-related genes collected from ctd, kegg and gene card databases in each dataset. the probability of obtaining such number of disease-related go-terms is calculated by fisher exact test. ‘#candidate snps’ denotes the number of mress snps passing our selection standards in each dataset, and ‘pubmed snps’ denotes how many of them are reported to be deleterious by pubmed query, the probability of the observation is also calculated by fisher exact test. we can figure out from the table that most of the p-values are below the significant level of  <dig> , which indicates mress snps as causal variants in most of the gwas datasets.

in total, we found  <dig> host-genes of significant mress snps enriched in overlapped biological processes with disease-related genes. the  <dig> mress snps  embedded in these genes with p-value ≤  <dig>  were selected as candidate causal mress snps.

candidate mress snps are over-represented in known deleterious 3′utr snps
to access the effectiveness of our method for selecting causal mress snps, we retrieved pubmed for all the  <dig>  mress snps with proxy in gwas datasets and defined  <dig> of them with at least one query result as positive samples . positive samples distributed un-evenly in different seed types. mress snps embedded in 7mer  sites possess the greatest precision , followed by 7mer  sites , 8mer sites  and 8mer-1a sites  respectively. 8mer and 8mer-1a sites possess larger binding energy than 7mer sites and are tolerable to mismatch. it may explain their relatively low precision. in total,  <dig> candidate mress snps  are positive, the sensitivity and precision of our method are  <dig>   and  <dig>   respectively. in contrast, only  <dig> in all the  <dig> mress snps with p-value ≤ 1 × 10− <dig> are positive. the sensitivity of multiple-testing correction is much lower than our method  whereas its precision doesn’t present significant advantage . the probability of getting  <dig> unbiased, pubmed-documented snps in  <dig> randomly selected mress snps is  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  which indicates candidate causal mress snps are in truly functional regions. we also calculated this probability for each of the gwas datasets and  <dig> of them showed statistical significance . taking the sle dataset phs <dig> pha <dig> as an example again,  <dig> of  <dig> candidate causal mress snps are known deleterious snps passing correction, significance of the observation is 4 × 10− <dig>  the seven snps are rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig>  respectively. to speculate their pathogenesis, we performed detailed literature analysis for each of the seven snps.table  <dig> 
information about the  <dig> candidate causal mress snps have been reported to be deleterious


‘a > g’ denote allele a as the reference allele and g as the variant allele. the ‘type’ column denotes the effect of the variant allele to the given microrna-gene interactions, a type of ‘create/lose’ means the variant allele of the snp can create some of the given interactions while eliminate others.



rs <dig> c > t and rs <dig> c > a are snps with high ld, and both are located in the mresss of mefv gene. mutant alleles t and a create the interactions between mefv mrna and mir-1226/4252/4733-3p as well as mefv mrna mir-4435/4645-5p/ <dig>  ustek et al.  <cit>  reported higher frequency of heterozygotes for the two snps in the familial mediterranean fever  patients after removing interference of cds snps , while notarnicola et al.  <cit>  demonstrated mefv gene was down-regulated in fmf patients. the observations are concordant with the speculation that mutant alleles of the two snps create microrna binding sites and lead to repression of the mefv gene. furthermore, shinar et al.  <cit>  found mutations in mefv gene affect phenotypes of sle patients, such as sle onset , renal failure  and febrile episodes . rs <dig> a > t is located in mress of il <dig> gene. mutant allele t interrupts binding-site of mir-1207-5p while creating new binding-sites for mir-940/4514/ <dig>  pistilli et al.  <cit>  discovered that genotype at and tt of rs <dig> are associated with pre- to post-training absolute difference in 1rm strength , fasting glucose  and bmi , which means mutant allele t leads to the development of muscle strength. combining with the report that il <dig> can inhibit protein degradation  <cit>  and counter muscle loss, which is a clinical feature of sle patient  <cit> . allele t may achieve its function through abolishing the repression of il <dig> mrna by mir-1207-5p, thus resulting in up-regulation of il <dig> protein. rs <dig> g > a is located in mress of irf <dig> gene. mutant allele a impairs interactions between irf <dig> mrna and mir-181a/ <dig> while enhancing binding-site of irf <dig> and mir-543/4477a/ <dig>  liu et al.  <cit>  and hu et al.  <cit>  validated the association between rs <dig> and sle in multi-ethnic population using meta-analysis. studies of alonso-perez et al.  <cit>  and lofgren et al.  <cit>  demonstrated mutant allele a induces up-regulation of irf <dig> mrna and irf <dig> protein in sle patients. another observation reported by lashine et al.  <cit>  is the significant down-regulation of mir-181a in sle patients. all these evidences strongly imply that rs <dig> regulates sle by altering the binding of irf <dig> mrna and mir-181a. rs <dig> t > c is located in mress of fgfr <dig> gene. mutant allele c eliminates interactions between fgfr <dig> and mir-3123/ <dig>  guimaraes et al.  <cit>  reported the association between rs <dig> and fracture non-union while study of jun et al.  <cit>  showed higher frequency of allele c in ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament patients . it was also reported that up-regulation of fgfr <dig> gene leads to joint fusion in mouse  <cit> . taking all the three reports into account, the microrna dysfunction induced by mutant allele c should be the mechanism behind injury of bone and ligament, which is also a manifestation of sle patient. rs <dig> a > g is located in mress of ddr <dig> gene. mutant allele g creates interactions between ddr <dig> mrna and mir-4499/ <dig>  roig et al.  <cit>  revealed the association between rs <dig> and schizophrenia. mutant allele g corresponds to the down-regulation of ddr <dig> gene in peripheral blood lymphocytes of schizophrenia patients, which is consistent with the role of g allele that introduces microrna repression. note that some sle patients have been reported to suffer from schizophreniform psychosis  <cit> , and polymorphisms at the locus of rs <dig> may be a plausible reason. rs <dig> a > g is located in ephx <dig> gene. mutant allele g causes loss of the interaction between ephx <dig> mrna and mir- <dig>  lee et al.  <cit>  observed higher risk of renal dysfunction after kidney-transplantation in individuals carrying genotype aa of rs <dig> . hama et al.  <cit>  reported an obvious down-regulation of ephx <dig> gene in mouse liver isografts compared with allografts , which implies down-regulation of ephx <dig> is associated with transplant rejection. as genotype aa maximizes the repression of ephx <dig> induced by mir- <dig>  its pathogenic mechanism may have a rational explanation.

in summary, experimental evidences of all the seven candidate causal mress snps support the inference that they are functional snps with the abilities to mediate microrna-induced mrna repression, and it’s worth noting that some of them have not been reported to be associated with sle directly, but are related to other diseases that share the same or similar symptoms with sle, indicating mress snps as common pathogenic factor beyond specific disease.

candidate mress snps tend to be embedded in negatively co-expressed microrna-mrna interactions and change binding free energy of the mresss greatly
co-expression of microrna and mrna in the same tissue is the prerequisite of their interaction. if further evidence demonstrates their co-expression is negatively correlated, regulatory relationship can be established. we retrieved mircox database and obtained co-expression evidences for  <dig> microrna-mrna interactions affected by the candidate causal mress snps. then, we compared their pearson correlation coefficient to that of the other interactions predicted by targetscan. significant enrichment at the part of weakly negative correlation and anti-enrichment at the part of positive correlation were observed for these interactions . correlation coefficients were not enriched in the part of highly negative correlation probably because most of the  <dig> interactions were created/enhanced by minor allele of the candidate causal mress snps. for the majority of the samples included by mircox database, such interactions may only maintain at a relatively low level. another reason would be the mix of expression from all tissues that dilutes the truly negative correlations in real diseased tissues.figure  <dig> 
enrichment pattern of pearson correlation coefficients of the co-expressed microrna-mrna pairs containing candidate causal mress snps. we divided pairs with candidate causal mress snps into ten aliquots according to the correlation coefficients and obtained ten intervals. then, we counted the number of mress snps, not necessarily candidate snps, falling into each interval. at last, we divided the number of candidate causal mress snps in each interval by that of the total set and took logarithm. a value greater than zero means microrna-mrna pairs containing candidate causal mress snps enrich in this part, and a value less than zero stands for anti-enrichment. this figure displays significant enrichment at parts of weakly negative correlation and anti-enrichment at parts of positive correlation, which demonstrates pairs containing candidate causal mress snps are more likely to be interactive.



mress snps will change the affinity of mresss and thus lead to alternation of binding free energy between wild type and mutant type mresss. candidate snps should trigger greater energy alternation to ensure effectiveness. to test this hypothesis, we calculated alternation of binding free energy  for each mress snp using a nearest-neighbor algorithm  <cit> . then we compared ΔΔg of candidate mress snps to that of the total set . a slightly decline of the peak near zero was observed for candidate causal mress snps, which was concordant with a larger average |ΔΔg| of 4210 cal/mol for candidate causal mress snps versus 4105 cal/mol for all mress snps mapped to gwas datasets. this result proved our hypothesis.

a single mrna may have multiple mresss in its 3′utr. if the snps embedded in these mresss are in high ld with each other, their effects can be accumulated as haplotype scores. haplotypes with greater accumulated |ΔΔg| should have greater impact on the expression level of mrnas. we identified  <dig> haplotypes comprised of at least two mress snps in 3′utr of  <dig> protein-coding genes, using ld data of  <dig> genome pilot <dig>  the average |ΔΔg| is 8521 cal/mol. if we only concern about haplotypes containing candidate mress snps, the average |ΔΔg| would increase to a much greater value of 9781 cal/mol. we also compared the distribution of ΔΔg between haplotypes containing candidate mress snps and the total set, and got more striking results .figure  <dig> 
distribution of the alternations of binding free energy  are different between candidate causal mress snps and the total set of mress snps in  <dig> gwas datasets. red dotted line denotes the candidate causal mress snps while black solid line denotes the total set of mress snps in  <dig> gwas datasets. ΔΔg in figure 6
a is calculated by single snp while that in figure 6
b is calculated by haplotype. we can observe a decline of the peak near zero and rightward shift for candidate mress snps, which indicates the greater alternation of binding free energy are created.



CONCLUSIONS
micrornas are important post-transcriptional regulators. variants in their recognition element seed sites can result in dysfunction of microrna-induced mrna repression and thus lead to diseases. in this study, we proved mress snps to be functional for both credible mresss and predicted mresss. for credible mresss, we first demonstrated they were under strong purifying selection, and then proved that mress snp acted through interfering with microrna-mrna interaction. for predicted mresss, we did in-depth analysis for p-value of mress snps in  <dig> gwas datasets and found indication of truly disease-associated signals in most of datasets. we also proposed a method to select candidate causal mress snps based on both their p-values in gwas datasets and the relevance between their host genes and the interested disease. our method effectively reduced the loss of true positive signals caused by multiple-testing corrections, and had the potential to speculate pathogenesis of interested mress snp because of the introduction of biological context. candidate causal mress snps obtained by our method were over-represented in the known deleterious 3′utr snps. they tended to be embedded in negatively co-expressed microrna-mrna interactions and generated greater binding free energy alternation. all of these evidences proved our method, and the perception of selecting causal variant using gwas information is stable and effective. at last, the  <dig> candidate causal mress snps provided future researchers with a good source to initialize their studies.
