BACKGROUND
transition from seed maturation to seed germination and seedling development involves a complex network of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that down-regulate the expression of seed maturation genes in seedlings . seed maturation is under the control of a group of transcriptional activators including leafy cotyledon <dig> , lec1-like , abscisic acid insensitive <dig> , fusca <dig>  and lec <dig>  <cit> , which are collectively called the “lafl network”  <cit> . the b3-domain containing transcriptional repressors high-level expression of sugar-inducible gene <dig>  /vp1/abi3-like <dig>  and its homolog hsi2-like <dig> /val <dig> act redundantly to repress ectopic activation of embryonic traits during seed germination and seedling development by the “lafl network” of transcriptional activators . hsi <dig> was also shown to negatively regulate the expression of β-glucuronidase  or luciferase  reporters under the control of seed-maturation specific gene promoters in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings and vegetative organs  <cit> . since many of the genes repressed by hsi <dig> in vegetative tissues are involved in the maturation phase of seed development, including desiccation tolerance, knock-out hsi <dig> mutant seedlings show enhanced tolerance to water deficit whereas the overexpression of hsi <dig> resulted in hypersensitivity to desiccation stress  <cit> . recently, it was shown that both fus <dig> and lec <dig> loss of function mutants can completely suppress the embryonic phenotype of hsi2/hsl <dig> double mutant seedlings, while it is partially suppressed in abi <dig>  lec <dig> and l1l mutants  <cit> . these results indicate that hsi <dig> and hsl <dig> function redundantly to repress the expression of these regulatory genes in seedlings to prevent ectopic expression of embryonic traits during seed germination and vegetative development.

developmental regulation of gene expression in plants is affected by chromatin mediated epigenetic mechanisms that include dna methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone variants, and histone modifications  <cit> . dna methylation at the 5′ position of cytosine plays important roles in transcriptional silencing of transposons, repeat sequences, transgenes and transcribed genes  <cit> . in addition to dna methylation, histone modifications also play a vital role in the regulation of both transposons and transcribed genes in plants. methylation of various lysine residues in the n-terminal tail of histone h <dig> is a well characterized epigenetic mechanism. in arabidopsis, mono- , di-  or tri-  methylation of histone h <dig> occurs mainly at lysine  <dig> , lysine  <dig> , lysine  <dig>  and lysine  <dig>   <cit> . h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> are enriched on actively transcribed genes whereas h3k27me <dig> marks are associated with developmental repression of transcribed genes. h3k9me2/ <dig> marks, which are associated with dna methylation and small interfering rnas , are enriched in heterochromatic regions known to be involved in transcriptional silencing of transposons, repeat sequences and transgenes  <cit> .

hsi <dig> and hsl <dig> proteins were predicted to contain a phd-like domain, a b3-dna binding domain, a conserved cysteine and tryptophan residue-containing  domain and an ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression  motif  <cit> . both cw and phd protein domains are known to recognize methylated histone marks . hoppmann et al.  <cit>  showed that the cw domain of hsi <dig> binds to h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> in vitro and, recently, it was reported that the hsl <dig> cw domain interacts with the histone deacetylase hda <dig> to repress the “lafl network” genes, including lec <dig> and lec <dig>  by promoting histone deacetylation and the addition of h3k27me <dig> marks  <cit> . however, molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the hsi <dig> phd-like domain-mediated regulation of gene expression remain to be elucidated.

previously, we reported a novel hsi <dig> allele, hsi2- <dig>  in arabidopsis that harbors a point mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution  in the second zinc finger of the hsi <dig> phd-like domain. the hsi2- <dig> mutant seedlings that carry a glutathione s-transferase f8::luciferase  reporter gene showed constitutively elevated transgene expression  <cit> . in addition to the luc transgene, hsi <dig> phd-like domain is required for the non-redundant repression of several seed-maturation genes in seedlings. these genes include those that encode both regulatory factors such as fus <dig>  and agamous-like  <dig>  and structural proteins that include cupin family storage protein, oleosins, late-embryogenesis-related proteins and seed storage albumins. moreover, seed-specific genes that are de-repressed in hsi2- <dig> mutant seedlings are targets of h3k27me <dig> marks. chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative pcr  analyses indicated that hsi <dig> phd-like domain promotes h3k27me <dig> marks on transgene gstf <dig> promoter and luc coding sequences to repress transgene expression in parental gstf8::luc reporter  seedlings  <cit> . both wtluc and hsi2-4luc mutant plants harbor two independent transgene loci  <cit> . one locus, located on chromosome iv, confers kanamycin resistance and luminescence, whereas the second locus, which is on chromosome v, confers only luminescence. based on kanamycin sensitivity, the chromosome iv and chromosome v loci were named as kanr and kans, respectively  <cit> .

in this work, we show that hsi <dig> phd-like domain represses luc transgene expression from both kanr and kans loci by promoting h3k27me <dig> marks but not dna methylation and sirna associated h3k9me <dig> marks. expression of neomycin phosphotransferase ii  from the kanr locus is also partially suppressed in an hsi2-dependent mechanism. however, while our data indicate that dna methylation and histone deacetylation are not involved in the transcriptional repression of transgene loci in wtluc, the hsi <dig> phd-like domain may play a role in the inhibition of seedling growth and development caused by dna methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine .

RESULTS
disruption of hsi <dig> phd-like domain affects the expression of both kanr and kans transgene loci
the gstf8::luc reporter construct contains a gstf <dig> promoter sequence that controls the transcription of a luciferase expression cassette, along with an nptii gene under control of the nopaline synthase promoter and terminator sequences, which confers kanamycin resistance in plants . the parental wtluc reporter line harbors two independent transgene insertion sites, kanr and kans. the kanr locus was mapped to chromosome iv, while the kans locus is located on chromosome v   <cit> . active luciferase is expressed by both kanr and kans loci, conferring a luminescent phenotype; however, only the kanr locus expresses nptii; thus, plants that harbor only the kanr locus are resistant to kanamycin, while kans plants are sensitive to this antibiotic.figure  <dig>

number of luc copies was determined by absolute quantitative real-time pcr. calibration curves were created using pbi121-gstf8::luc plasmid dna as a template. a single copy gene, at5g <dig>  was used as an internal control for normalization of the data. wtluc plants contain two unlinked transgene insertion loci composed of multiple t-dna insertions. while both insertions express luc only one expresses nptii and confers resistance to kanamycin. these loci were separated by genetic segregation to produce lines that are kanamycin sensitive  or kanamycin resistant . luc copy numbers were calculated for the kan
s, kan
r and wtluc arabidopsis lines as described previously  <cit> . genomic dna from col- <dig> wild-type plants was used as a negative control.



to estimate the number of luc copies at both kanr and kans loci, real-time quantitative pcr  was performed using genomic dna from wtluc, kanr and kans plants. since both kanr and kans loci confer luminescence expression, we used pcr primers that are specific to the luc coding sequences to estimate the copy numbers. the results show that kans plants contain  <dig> copies of luc whereas the kanr locus harbors  <dig> luc copies. independent analysis of wtluc plants, which contain both kanr and kans loci, showed seven copies of the luc transgene . therefore, both kanr and kans loci are complex and contain multiple copies of the gstf8::luc transgene.

previously, we showed that disruption of the hsi <dig> phd-like domain affects the expression of the kanr transgene locus  <cit>  but the effect of this mutation on the kans locus was not evaluated. therefore, to further investigate whether the kans transgene locus is also regulated by the hsi <dig> phd-like domain mutation and investigate potential interactions between kanr and kans transgene loci in wtluc and hsi2-4luc mutant plants, these two loci were separated by crossing plants of the wtluc reporter line and the hsi2-4luc mutant line into col- <dig> wild-type arabidopsis and subsequent selection for homozygous wtluc and hsi2- <dig> lines that carry either the kanr or kans reporter gene locus.

comparison of luciferase expression in seedlings homozygous for the isolated kanr and kans transgene loci in the wild-type background showed that kanr seedlings had higher luminescence signals  and steady state levels of luc mrna  than kans seedlings. this is in agreement with the relative number of transgene copies at these loci. however, in spite of carrying more luciferase transgene copies than kanr seedlings, wtluc seedlings, showed significantly lower luminescence signal and luc transcript levels. on the other hand, analysis of the expression of these transgenes in the hsi2- <dig> background showed strongly enhanced luciferase expression in all of the lines and the relative levels of both luminescence signal and luc transcripts corresponded with transgene copy number, with highest levels seen in hsi2-4luc seedlings and lowest levels in hsi2-4-kans samples . this could indicate that, in a wild-type background, the presence of both the kanr and kans loci may lead to stronger suppression of transgene expression but disruption of the hsi <dig> phd-like domain affects the expression of luc transgenes at both kanr and kans loci similarly. thus, the more complete hsi2-mediated repression of the gstf8::luc transgenes in wtluc plants results in stronger relative activation of their expression in the presence of the hsi2- <dig> mutation.figure  <dig>

transgene locus or both. real-time reverse transcription quantitative pcr was used to determine the relative transcript levels of endogenous gstf <dig>  luc and nptii genes in five day old seedlings of various genotypes. gstf <dig> produces two different transcripts with different fragment lengths by alternative start sites namely gstf8-long and gstf8-short  <cit> . expression of gstf8-total represents transcripts from both gstf8-long and gstf8-short versions whereas gstf8-long expression level corresponds to gstf8-long transcript. ef1α was used for normalization. data represent means  of two biological replicates with three technical replicates each. significant differences in luc transcript levels between the three luciferase reporter lines in the wild-type background and the respective hsi2- <dig> mutant background, determined using two-tailed student’s t-test assuming unequal variances, are indicated by letters .



alternative transcriptional start sites of the endogenous gstf <dig> gene result in two different transcripts with different sizes: gstf8-long  and gstf8-short   <cit> . to determine whether endogenous gstf <dig> expression is altered in hsi <dig> mutant alleles, we performed qrt-pcr using various wild type lines  and hsi <dig> mutant lines . hsi2- <dig> is a loss-of-function mutant allele that carries a t-dna insertion in the seventh exon of hsi <dig> gene  . to obtain the hsi2-2luc line, gstf8::luc transgenes were introgressed into the hsi2- <dig> mutant background by genetic crossing. expression of gstf8-total  represents both gstf8-l and gstf8-s transcripts whereas gstf8-long expression represents gstf8-l transcripts only. as shown in figure  <dig>  levels of endogenous gstf8-l and gstf8-t transcripts were not significantly affected in hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc plants and nptii expression was not detected in the kans reporter line, consistent with the kanamycin sensitivity of these plants. nptii transcripts were expressed at similar levels in the wtluc and hsi2-4luc seedlings but expression of nptii in kanr seedlings was responsive to the hsi <dig> phd-like domain point mutation . steady-state levels of nptii transcripts from the kanr locus were about 3-fold higher in hsi2- <dig> seedlings than in the wild-type background. taken together, these results indicate that both the gstf8::luc and nos::nptii transgenes of the t-dna cassette are partially suppressed by hsi <dig> in kanr seedlings; however the nptii genes at the kans locus may be fully silenced and/or contain loss-of-function mutations. furthermore, in wtluc seedlings where the kans locus is present, expression of both luc and the nptii genes at the kanr is more strongly suppressed.

luciferase expression is not affected by dna methylation or histone deacetylation inhibitors
complex transgenes with tandem repeats in plants are often subjected to dna methylation and histone deacetylation mediated transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . if the gstf8::luc transgene loci in the wtluc plants are targets of dna methylation, treatment of these seedlings with an inhibitor of dna methylation should derepress the luminescence expression similar to that seen in hsi2- <dig> seedlings. previous reports showed that treatment with  <dig> μm/ml of the dna methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine  was effective in derepressing the transcriptional silencing of auxin-responsive ß-gus reporter lines  <cit> . treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with  <dig> μm/ml 5-azadc also caused global changes in gene expression and derepression of silenced transgenes  <cit> . to investigate whether dna methylation is involved in repressing gstf8::luc transgene expression, wtluc, hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc seedlings were grown on media containing 5-azadc at various concentrations. luminescence expression in wtluc seedlings was not affected at either  <dig> or  <dig> μm/ml 5-azadc concentrations . hence, dna-methylation does not appear to be required for the repression of luc expression in wtluc seedlings.figure  <dig>

histone deacetylation is known to regulate gene expression by transcriptional repression in eukaryotes  <cit> . recently, it was reported that treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a  or down-regulation of two histone deacetylase genes, hda <dig> and hda <dig> by rna interference resulted in derepression of the embryonic program in germinating seeds and seedlings  <cit> . arabidopsis seedlings treated with tsa and histone deacetylase mutants mimic the phenotypes of hsi2-2/hsl1double mutant seedlings  <cit> , indicating that hsi2- and hsl1-mediated repression of the embryonic program could involve histone deacetylation. hsl <dig> was shown to physically interact with hda <dig> via its cw domain and disruption of hsl <dig> resulted in increased h3k4me <dig> and decreased h3k27me <dig> marks on genes that encode transcriptional activators involved in the embryonic program  <cit> . to test the effects of tsa on the luminescence expression of wtluc seedlings, wtluc, hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc seedlings were grown on media containing  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml tsa. since higher concentrations of tsa resulted in severe growth retardation and developmental delay in all seedlings tested , only,  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml of tsa was used in these assays. luminescence imaging data showed that treatments of wtluc seedlings with tsa did not affect their luminescence expression , indicating that hsi <dig> phd-like domain mediated repression of luc transgene expression in wtluc seedlings is not dependent on tsa-sensitive histone deacetylation.

hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings are partially resistant to dna methylation inhibitor 5-azadc induced growth inhibition
we noticed that the growth and development of wtluc seedlings on plates that contained  <dig> μm/ml 5-azadc was more strongly inhibited than hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings . to further characterize the effects of 5-azadc on hypocotyl and root growth, wtluc, hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc seeds were germinated on media containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm 5-azadc. after  <dig> days of incubation on 5-azadc-containing media, all seedlings showed dose-dependent inhibition of growth and development. however, the most severe effects were seen with wtluc seedlings whereas the growth of hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings was less inhibited . while wtluc seeds germinated when incubated on media containing  <dig> μm 5-azadc, subsequent root growth and cotyledon development was almost completely abrogated while both and hsi2-4luc and hsi2-2luc mutant seedlings continued to grow and develop, albeit slowly, under these conditions . comparative measurements of hypocotyl and root growth indicated that hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings were about one half as sensitive to 5-azadc-dependent inhibition as wtluc seedlings at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm 5-azadc treatments . these data indicate that, although 5-azadc does not affect the hsi2-dependent suppression of luciferase expression in wtluc plants, hsi <dig> does affect sensitivity to 5-azadc-dependent inhibition of seedling development.figure  <dig>

luc and nptii transgene expression is associated with changes in histone methylation marks
to examine the histone methylation properties along the transgene cassette and the role of hsi <dig> phd-like domain in regulating those marks and transgene expression, chip-qpcr analyses were performed using  <dig> day old seedlings of various genotypes. antibodies specific to h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> marks were used, along with pcr primers that specifically amplify sequences from the endogenous  and transgene gstf <dig> promoters and luc and nptii coding regions. for the specific amplifications of e <dig> and e <dig> pcr fragments only from the endogenous gstf <dig> promoter sequence during chip-qpcr, at least one pcr primer that binds outside of the − <dig> bp endogenous gstf <dig> region that is not part of the gstf8::luc transgene cassette was used. also, to make sure the pcr products of t <dig> and t <dig> fragments are only amplified from the gstf <dig> transgene promoter sequence, at least one primer that binds outside of the − <dig> bp region in the gstf8::luc transgene cassette was used . pcr amplification specificities of e <dig>  e <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> fragments were confirmed using col- <dig> wild-type and wtluc. among the histone methylation marks, h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> are associated with actively transcribed genes, while h3k9me <dig> is a repressive mark commonly enriched on transposable elements and repetitive sequences  <cit> . h3k27me <dig> is a repressive mark associated with transcribed genes that are under tissue-specific or developmental regulation . preimmune immunoglobulin g  was used as a negative control for non-specific binding and all genomic dna fragments tested show very low background levels of enrichment when chromatin samples were immunoprecipitated with igg . fus <dig> was used as a positive control for h3k27me <dig>  while actin2/ <dig>  was used as a negative control for h3k27me <dig> and as a positive control for h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  ta <dig> was used as a positive control for h3k9me <dig> and as a negative control for h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  in agreement with our previous report  <cit> , chromatin from the transgene gstf <dig> promoter region, and both 5′ and 3′ ends of the luc coding sequences was highly enriched in h3k27me <dig> marks in wtluc seedlings  while endogenous gstf <dig> promoter sequences showed consistently low levels of h3k27me <dig> . chromatin from the 5′ region of the nptii coding sequence was also highly h3k27me <dig> enriched in wtluc seedlings . a substantial decrease in h3k27me <dig> levels was detected on chromatin from the transgene gstf <dig> promoter sequences and luc and nptii coding sequences in hsi2-4luc seedlings that carry a point mutation in hsi <dig> phd-like domain . though the transgene sequences tested showed considerable h3k <dig> dimethylation, unlike h3k27me <dig>  no significant differences in h3k9me <dig> enrichment were seen between chromatin from wtluc and hsi2-4luc seedlings at any of the sites tested . therefore, among the histone methylation marks associated with transcriptional suppression, only h3k27me <dig> was dependent on the hsi <dig> phd-like domain.figure  <dig>

histone methylation marks h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  which are associated with chromatin from actively transcribed genes, were enriched at all of the transgene sequences assayed in hsi2-4luc seedlings, relative to wtluc . these marks were particularly abundant at the proximal transgene gstf <dig> promoter and 5′ luc coding sequences but significant enrichment was also seen at the endogenous gstf <dig> promoter and nptii coding sequence.

to examine whether the hsi2-4-dependent changes in histone methylation marks are associated with both the kanr and kans transgene loci, chip-qpcr analyses were performed on various regions of the endogenous gstf <dig> gene and the gstf8::luc transgene in kanr, kans, hsi2-4-kanr and hsi2-4-kans seedlings . as in chromatin from wtluc seedlings, higher levels of h3k27me <dig> marks at transgene gstf <dig> promoter sequences and at luc and nptii coding sequences were detected in wild-type seedlings carrying either the kanr or kans transgene locus than in corresponding hsi2-4-kanr or hsi2-4-kans mutant seedlings. thus, the significant decrease in h3k27me <dig> levels at the gstf8::luc transgene associated with homozygosity for the hsi2- <dig> allele was seen at both insertion sites. while chromatin from transgene sequences generally had higher levels of h3k9me <dig> marks than the endogenous gstf <dig> gene, no significant change was seen between these genotypes.figure  <dig>

enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> was seen in chromatin at both kanr and kans loci in hsi2- <dig> seedlings . this enrichment was most pronounced at luc coding sequences rather than in promoter regions and significant enrichment was also seen in chromatin of the nptii gene at the kanr locus. therefore, disruption of hsi <dig> phd-like domain resulted in increased activation marks on 5′ and 3′ end of luc coding sequences in both kanr and kans backgrounds. however, increased h3k36me <dig> marks on the nptii coding sequences were observed only in hsi2-4-kanr seedlings .

h3k27me <dig> levels are significantly decreased on a subset of seed-maturation genes in hsi2luc mutant seedlings
some members of the lafl clade of regulatory genes that control the expression of seed maturation genes  <cit>  are misregulated in hsi <dig> mutant seedlings  <cit> . lec <dig> and abi <dig> are ectopically expressed in hsi2- <dig> but not in hsi2- <dig> seedlings, while fus <dig> is upregulated in both hsi2- <dig> and hsi2- <dig> lines  <cit> . these results suggested to us that the hsi2-dependent negative regulation of lec <dig> and abi <dig> in seedlings does not require the phd-like domain, while suppression of fus <dig> could be dependent on the phd-like domain of hsi <dig>  to determine if correlations exist between these expression patterns and histone modifications, chip-qpcr analysis of these genes was carried out on chromatin samples from wtluc, hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc seedlings using antih3k27me <dig> . consistent with our hypothesis, significant reductions in h3k27me <dig> chromatin marks were detected in association with abi <dig> and lec <dig> genomic sequences only in chromatin from hsi2-2luc but not hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings and genes such as lec <dig> and l1l, which are not misregulated in either hsi <dig> mutant allele alone, also showed no change in h3k27me <dig> marks in these mutant backgrounds. however, h3k27me <dig> marks associated with fus <dig> sequences were not altered in either mutant background. thus, the effects of hsi <dig> on fus <dig> expression do not appear to depend on alterations in h3k27me <dig>  on the other hand, the enrichment of h3k27me <dig> marks detected on both 5′ and 3′ coding sequences of agl <dig>  in wtluc seedlings was significantly decreased in both hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc backgrounds, which is consistent with the increased expression of agl <dig> in these mutants  <cit> . therefore, the hsi <dig> phd-like domain does appear to be required for both the repressed expression and h3k <dig> hypermethylation of the agl <dig> locus.figure  <dig>

mutant seedlings. chromatin samples were prepared using five day old wtluc, hsi2-2
luc and hsi2-4
luc seedlings. immunoprecipitations were performed using either igg  or anti-h3k27me <dig> antibody. data represent means  obtained from three qpcr reactions each from three independent immunoprecipitations from three different biological replicates. significant differences in h3k27me <dig> enrichments between wtluc and hsi2

as previously reported, a number of seed maturation-related structural genes are derepressed in hsi2- <dig> mutant seedlings  <cit> . to investigate whether the increased expression of these genes in hsi <dig> mutant seedlings correlates with changes in associated h3k27me <dig> marks, chip-qpcr analyses were performed on chromatin from wtluc, hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings using primers specific to at2g <dig>  protein), at3g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at2g <dig> -binding rossmann-fold superfamily protein), at5g <dig>  and at2g <dig> . these seed maturation genes were previously reported to be targets of h3k <dig> hypermethylation  <cit>  and our results confirmed that h3k27me <dig> marks were enriched, relative to igg, on the 5′coding sequences of these genes . in comparison to wtluc, significant decreases in h3k27me <dig> enrichments were detected in both hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant seedlings on chromatin associated with 5′ genomic sequences of dog <dig> and at2g <dig>  and at both 5′ and 3′ sequences of at3g <dig> . on the other hand, h3k27me <dig> levels on at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> were significantly decreased only in the hsi2-2luc background and not in chromatin from hsi2-4luc seedlings . these data indicate that, as with the regulatory genes described above, derepression of seed maturation-specific gene expression in hsi <dig> mutant seedlings often corresponds with decreased accumulation of h3k27me <dig> marks that may or may not depend on the presence of an intact hsi <dig> phd-like domain. however, as with fus <dig>  the lea-like protein gene at2g <dig>  which is expressed at elevated levels in both hsi2- <dig> and hsi2- <dig> mutant plants  <cit> , is strongly enriched for h3k27me <dig> but these marks are not significantly reduced in either hsi <dig> mutant.

discussion
despite detailed genetic and functional characterization, the molecular mechanisms that underlie hsi2- and hsl1-mediated repression of seed maturation program in seedlings are still not fully understood . hsi <dig> contains a phd-like domain  <cit>  and phd domains can act as “readers” of the histone methylation status of target genes to regulate their expression  <cit> . through characterization of a novel mutant allele, hsi2- <dig>  which affects the expression of gstf8::luc transgenes and certain seed maturation genes  <cit> , we provide evidence that the hsi <dig> phd-like domain is involved in regulating the expression of some genes by altering histone modifications.

quantitative pcr data indicates that both kanr and kans transgene loci in the wtluc reporter gene line contain multiple copies of the gstf8::luc transgene. the kanr locus is more complex than kans, harboring five copies of the transgene, while the kans locus includes two . transgene loci in plants that harbor multiple and complex transgene repeats at a single locus were frequently targeted by dna methylation-associated h3k9me <dig> marks and also histone deacetylation mediated transcriptional gene silencing . however, treatment of wtluc seedlings with either the dna methylation inhibitor 5-azadc or the histone deacetylase inhibitor tsa failed to derepress the luc expression in wtluc seedlings . also, chip-qpcr analyses showed no differences in dna methylation-associated h3k9me <dig> histone methylation marks on transgene sequences between wtluc and hsi2- <dig> mutants that harbor either individual kanr and kans loci or both . based on these data, it appears that dna methylation and histone deacetylation mechanisms are not involved in hsi <dig> phd-like domain-mediated repression of transgene expression in wtluc seedlings.

although 5-azadc did not affect luc expression in wtluc seedlings , hsi <dig> mutant seedlings treated with various concentrations of 5-azadc maintained root and hypocotyl growth better than wtluc seedlings under the same conditions . these results could indicate that hsi <dig> is somehow involved in the inhibition of seedling growth and development caused by 5-azadc and, since this effect was observed with both the phd-like domain mutant allele hsi2- <dig> and the hsi2- <dig> t-dna knock-out allele, it appears that the phd-like domain may be required for this 5-azadc-dependent inhibition of growth. lec <dig>  an hsi <dig> and hsl <dig> target gene and member of the “lafl network”, was shown to be regulated by dna methylation  <cit>  and the embryonic phenotypes of gain-of-function lec <dig> mutants were enhanced by treatment with a dna methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine  <cit> . hence, the partial rescue of seedling growth in hsi <dig> mutants in the presence of 5-azadc could be an indirect effect of changes in the dna methylation status of hsi2-targeted regulatory genes, including lec <dig> 

data presented here clearly indicate that the hsi <dig> phd-like domain is involved in suppressing the expression of gstf8::luc transgenes in both kanr and kans transgene loci . furthermore, the levels of luc expression seen in hsi2- <dig> plants that carry these reporter complexes correlate with transgene copy number, with relatively low levels of luc expression seen in hsi2- <dig>  kans plants that contain two gstf8::luc copies and correspondingly higher levels expression in hsi2- <dig>  kanr or hsi2-4luc lines with five and seven total reporter gene copies, respectively. the direct correlation between derepressed luc expression and the number of reporter gene copies means that the luminescence of mutant plants with compromised hsi2-dependent repression will be amplified in a high copy number reporter gene line, making these mutants far more apparent in a luminescence-based mutant screen. on the other hand, luc expression in wild-type plants that carry the kanr locus alone showed higher levels of luc transcripts than did wtluc seedlings . these results appear to indicate that the presence of both kanr and kans loci in the same genome may lead to stronger transcriptional suppression of the gstf8::luc reporter genes than when the kanr locus is present alone. no nptii transcripts were detected in either kans or hsi2-4-kans seedlings , which is consistent with the kanamycin sensitivity of these plants. however, hsi2-4-kanr seedlings showed 3-fold higher expression of nptii transcripts relative to wild-type kanr seedlings but this was not seen in corresponding hsi2-4luc and wtluc seedlings . thus, as with the luc reporter gene, the co-existence of kanr and kans loci is associated with stronger transcriptional repression of nptii gene expression. to better understand the function of the hsi <dig> phd-like domain, interactions between activation-associated and repressive histone methylation marks at the kanr and kans transgene loci were evaluated by chip-qpcr assays. transgene gstf <dig> promoter sequences, along with luc and nptii coding sequences were highly enriched in h3k27me <dig> marks in wtluc seedlings  and significantly lower amounts of h3k27me <dig> were observed on these transgene sequences in the hsi2- <dig> mutant background . similar histone modification patterns were observed in seedlings harboring individual kanr or kans loci . thus, the phd-like domain of hsi <dig>  which is required to repress the expression of these transgene complexes, is also necessary for the appearance of h3k27me <dig> marks on these loci. in contrast, h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> histone methylation marks, which are associated with active gene expression and have been shown to inhibit h3k27me <dig> marks on transcribed genes in both animals and plants , were enriched on these transgene sequences in hsi2- <dig> seedlings, relative to those with the wild-type hsi <dig> allele. thus, the decrease in h3k27me <dig> marks on transgene sequences in both kanr and kans loci in the hsi2- <dig> mutant background is associated with both increased expression  and increased accumulation of h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> marks . developmental repression of transcribed genes is often associated with h3k27me <dig> marks  <cit>  but emerging evidence also suggests that h3k27me <dig> may act as an alternative to dna methylation-associated h3k9me <dig> in transposable elements and repetitive sequence silencing . turck et al.  <cit>  showed that the chromodomain-containing h3k27me <dig> “reader” protein lhp <dig>  is enriched on tandemly duplicated genes, such as the nine closely linked chitinase/glucosylase- <dig> genes  on chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis, but not on segmentally duplicated genes. expressed genes that flank tandemly duplicated gene loci are also not associated with lhp <dig>  both kanr and kans loci contain multiple gstf8::luc transgenes at individual loci  and expression of genes that flank the kanr transgene locus does not differ between wtluc and hsi2-4luc seedlings  <cit> . however, similarities in hsi2-dependent h3k27me <dig> accumulation at the kanr and kans loci and the corresponding relative changes in luc expression in hsi2- <dig> plants lead us to speculate that transcriptional repression is mediated by the gstf8::luc transgene itself and is not dependent on tandem t-dna insertions. the presence of multiple transgene copies results in high levels of expression that accentuates the apparent repressive effect of hsi <dig> when its activity is compromised by mutation. however, since luc expression in wtluc seedlings is lower than in kanr seedlings, the presence of these two unlinked loci appears to have synergistic effects on reporter gene silencing.

in contrast to the gstf8::luc reporter genes, expression of native gstf <dig> transcripts derived from either the “long” or “short” transcriptional start sites show no significant increase in the hsi2-4luc mutant background . the most parsimonious explanation for the discrepancy between native gstf <dig> expression and the expression of the gstf8::luc reporter gene is that the isolated gstf <dig> promoter sequence used in the gstf8::luc gene construct, which corresponds with the short promoter as defined by thatcher et al.  <cit> , could contain cis-acting suppressor elements that are masked in the context of the native gene. support for this explanation can be seen in figure 4b of veerappan et al.  <cit> . in this experiment, luc expression  was assayed in wt col- <dig> and mutant hsi2- <dig> arabidopsis plants newly transformed with either short-gstf8::luc or long-gstf8::luc gene constructs . no significant differences in luminescence were apparent between col-l and hsi2-4-l plants but luc expression driven by the short gstf <dig> promoter in hsi2-4-s plants was substantially elevated relative to that detected in col-s plants.

polycomb group  proteins are evolutionarily conserved multi-protein complexes required for developmental repression of gene expression by chromatin based mechanisms. pcg proteins in plants comprise of two major complexes: polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  and prc <dig> . arabidopsis prc <dig> proteins bmi <dig> and ring <dig> were shown to have histone h2a mono ubiquitination  activity in vitro  <cit> , whereas prc <dig> complex proteins catalyze the deposition of h3k27me <dig> marks to promote developmental repression in animals and plants .

the gstf <dig> promoter sequence used in the gstf8::luc reporter contains an octopine synthase  sequence element at − <dig>  that is known to be required for transcriptional activation in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stress signals  <cit> . this ocs element is flanked by ocs element binding factor  <dig> and ocs element binding proteins  <dig>  elements that were shown to bind proteins of the dna binding with one finger  family of transcription factors and are reported to act either as positive or negative regulatory factors in various plant genes  <cit> . a putative myeloblastosis <dig>  binding element is also located at − <dig> but its potential function is unknown. sequence elements with a potential role in prc2-based silencing can also be identified in the gstf <dig> promoter. by analyzing the co-distribution of the ubiquitous arabidopsis prc <dig> protein fertilization independent endosperm  and h3k27me <dig> marks, deng et al.  <cit>  identified four sequence motifs that could act as prc <dig> binding sites. two of these motifs are found in the gstf <dig> promoter, a putative gaga box located between − <dig> and − <dig> relative to the transcription start site and a ttc repeat element located in the 5′ untranslated region between + <dig> and + <dig>  gaga elements were found to be specifically associated with fie and h3k27me <dig> enriched sites and these sequences are also found in polycomb response elements  of drosophila  <cit> . however, while gaa  sequence motifs were found to be associated with genomic regions that bind both fie and h3k27me <dig>  they were also enriched in random promoter sequences and were, therefore, not considered to be specific prc <dig> binding sites  <cit> .

the role of the gaga element in the transcriptional regulation of the prc2-repressed lec <dig> gene was confirmed by berger et al.  <cit> . however, mutational analysis showed that, in this context, the gaga element acted as a required cis-activating element, which was associated with a distinct cis-repressing element, termed repressive lec <dig> element  that apparently consists of two component sequences. comparison of the lec <dig> rle sequence with the gstf <dig> promoter identified a duplicated element identical to the 5′ component of the lec <dig> rle. as in the lec <dig> gene, the putative gstf <dig> rle-like sequence is located immediately downstream of the gaga element . whether this putative gaga-rle motif plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the gstf <dig> promoter in a transgene context is not known.

chip-qpcr analyses were carried out to investigate whether lafl network genes and other seed maturation genes that are up-regulated in hsi <dig> mutant seedlings are also associated with hsi2-dependent changes in h3k27me <dig> marks. with the exception of l1l, all the tested seed maturation genes are enriched with h3k27me <dig> marks in wtluc seedlings  in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . significant reductions in h3k27me <dig> levels, relative to wtluc seedlings, were observed at some gene loci in both hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc seedlings, while other genes showed reductions only in hsi2-2luc seedlings and a few showed no changes in either hsi <dig> mutant background. in general, these hsi2-dependent differences in h3k27me <dig> marks correlate well with hsi2-dependent changes in gene expression. for example, among the regulatory genes tested, abi <dig> and lec <dig>  which are expressed at elevated levels in hsi2- <dig> seedlings but not in hsi2- <dig> seedlings  <cit> , showed correspondingly decreased levels of h3k32me <dig> enrichment in chromatin from hsi2-2luc plants but not from hsi2-4luc plants . on the other hand, h3k27me <dig> marks on agl <dig> were strongly decreased in both hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc mutant plants  and expression of this gene is also upregulated in both hsi <dig> mutant backgrounds. these results can be interpreted to indicate that hsi2-dependent transcriptional repression and h3k <dig> hypermethylation of agl <dig> is mediated by the phd-like domain while that of abi <dig> and lec <dig> may be mediated by other hsi <dig> domains, such as the cw domain, which was shown to interact with hda <dig> to promote histone deacetylation and h3k27me <dig> marks to repress seed maturation genes  <cit> .

similar patterns can be seen in the structural  seed maturation gene sample. the putative glycine-rich protein gene  is more strongly expressed in hsi2-2luc plants than in hsi2-4luc plants  <cit>  and h3k27me <dig> marks at this site are correspondingly reduced in hsi2-2luc but not hsi2-4luc mutants. on the other hand, genes for a cupin-like protein , dog <dig>  and a proline-rich glycoprotein  are similarly up-regulated in hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc plants and decreased h3k27me <dig> marks are also apparent in both mutant lines.

two of the genes in our sample group do not show correlations between hsi2-dependent transcriptional repression and h3k27me <dig> marks. these genes, fus <dig> and the lea protein gene at2g <dig>  are expressed at elevated levels in both hsi2-2luc and hsi2-4luc backgrounds and accumulate substantial h3k27me <dig> in wtluc plants but these marks are not diminished in either hsi <dig> mutant. therefore, derepression of these genes in hsi <dig> mutant plants does not appear to require the depletion of h3k27me <dig>  it seems likely that, in addition to the prc2-mediated accumulation of h3k27me <dig> marks, other mechanisms are involved in the repression of these genes.

agl <dig> is a member of the mikc subfamily of mads domain transcription factors that is preferentially expressed in developing embryos. ectopic overexpression of agl <dig> results in enhanced somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . agl <dig> acts upstream of lafl network genes and several lafl genes are direct regulatory targets of agl <dig>  <cit> . dog <dig> is a seed-specific gene and plays a critical role in promoting seed dormancy by integrating environmental signals  <cit> . recently, agl <dig> and dog <dig> were shown to be targets of h3k27me <dig> marks, which could be mediated by prc <dig> proteins  <cit> . our data shows that hsi <dig> regulates the expression of agl <dig> and dog <dig> in seedlings by promoting h3k27me <dig> marks possibly via prc1-prc <dig> complex which requires hsi <dig> phd-like domain.

hsi <dig> was shown to directly interact with prc <dig> complex proteins atbmi1a/b/c and is required for the deposition of h2aubi and h3k27me <dig> marks on “lafl network” seed-maturation genes including lec <dig>  fus <dig> and abi <dig>  <cit> . disruption of prc <dig> complex genes in arabidopsis led to decreased h3k27me <dig> levels, activation of “lafl network” transcription factor genes and ectopic expression of embryonic traits during seed germination and vegetative development  <cit> . thus, it is possible that hsi <dig> interacts with prc <dig> proteins like atbmi <dig> to recruit prc <dig> proteins such as the histone methyltransferase curly leaf , to deposit h3k27me <dig> marks on the gstf8::luc transgene loci. atring1a was also shown to physically interact with the prc <dig> core component clf  <cit>  and several reports have demonstrated the involvement of phd-prc <dig> and phd-prc1-prc <dig> complexes in deposition of h3k27me <dig> marks to promote transcriptional repression of gene expression in plants  <cit> . similarly, hsi <dig> could be part of a repression complex that involves the hsi <dig> phd-like domain, prc <dig> and prc <dig> complex proteins to promote high levels of h3k27me <dig> marks on native seed maturation genes and gstf8::luc transgene loci to repress their expression during the seed to seedling developmental phase transition.

CONCLUSIONS
hsi <dig> contains a putative phd domain, which could act as a “reader” of histone methylation marks. in this work, we show that hsi <dig> phd-like domain regulates both luc and nptii transgenes from two independent transgene loci. transcriptional repression of both of these transgene loci by hsi <dig> phd-like domain is associated with repressive histone methylation marks h3k27me <dig> but not sirna and dna methylation associated h3k9me <dig> marks. in addition to the transgenes, hsi <dig> is also required for the repression of a subset of seed maturation genes in seedlings by promoting h3k27me <dig> marks in a phd-like domain dependent and independent manner.
