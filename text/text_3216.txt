BACKGROUND
photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile  rice, nongken 58s, was discovered as a spontaneous mutant in the japonica rice cultivar nongken  <dig>  grown in hubei province, china in  <dig>  <cit> . it has since been used for production of hybrid rice, and during the past two decades, great achievements have been made in improving rice yields in china using two-line hybrid rice. several important features of nongken 58s have been characterised. its fertility is highly regulated by day length at specific inflorescence developmental stages. complete male sterility can be induced when the day length is greater than  <dig> h from the glume primordium differentiation stage to the pollen mother cell forming stage. however, male fertility returns gradually when the day length is shorter than  <dig> h  <cit> . this is called the second photoperiod phenomenon  <cit> , referring to the short day photoperiod that rice requires for the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth  <cit> . this agronomic trait is genetically controlled by a recessive locus within the nuclear genome. however, the genetic loci vary depending on the genetic background of the recipient parents. that is, when crossed with a less photoperiod-sensitive cultivar, the genes for the trait appear as two or three loci  <cit> . the photoperiod sensitivity can also be affected by temperature when the pms gene is crossed into a temperature-sensitive cultivar. previous studies have indicated that phytochromes and cryptochromes are involved in the male sterility transition  <cit> . because male sterility is highly and coordinately regulated by day length and temperature, this leads to difficulty in the accurate identification of the male sterile phenotype in the segregation populations between japonica and indica under natural conditions. although it would be of great value to breeders, this makes mapping the pms gene challenging  <cit> . it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of the male sterility transition and to explore whether the light or circadian rhythm signal transduction pathway is involved in this process. it may also be useful to understand how light or the circadian rhythm regulates microsporocyte development. this information could assist breeders in selecting recipient parents for molecular breeding programs.

circadian rhythms, in general, take the form of sinusoidal waves that can be described using mathematical terms such as period, phase and amplitude  <cit> . the expression of several genes has been found to be associated with the circadian rhythm in arabidopsis. these include timing of cab expression <dig>   <cit> , late elongated hypocotyl   <cit> , circadian and clock associated <dig>   <cit>  and gigantea . toc <dig>  lhy, cca <dig> and unknown factor y  <cit>  comprise interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. these feedback loops play important roles in the plant central clock. these loops integrate environmental factors, such as light and temperature, into the central clock through the input signaling pathway and import the rhythm signal into downstream signaling pathways through output signaling pathways.

two main pathways controlling flowering time are found in rice. one is the early heading date <dig> /heading date3a /rice flowering locus t <dig> -dependent pathway  <cit> . in this pathway, the upstream gene ehd2/rid1/osid <dig>  under short-day  conditions, activates ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> then activates hd3a/rft <dig> to promote rice flowering. by contrast, ehd <dig> is suppressed under long-day  conditions. hd3a/rft <dig> is also suppressed, leading to the inhibition of rice flowering  <cit> . the other pathway is the heading date <dig> -hd3a/rft1-dependent pathway  <cit> . in this pathway, hd <dig> is activated by osgi under ld or sd conditions. hd <dig> then activates hd3a/rft <dig> expression and promotes flowering under sd conditions. however, hd <dig> suppresses hd3a/rft <dig> expression and inhibits flowering under ld conditions  <cit> . previous research has indicated that circadian rhythms and day length are not only involved in the promotion of reproductive organs from the vegetative stage in higher plants  <cit> , but are also involved in various physiological processes, including photosynthesis  <cit> , starch metabolism  <cit> , phytohormone response  <cit> , hypocotyl elongation  <cit> , and plant-pathogen interaction  <cit> . however, the involvement of these two signaling pathways in the male sterility transition has not been reported.

this paper reports the comparison of the transcriptomes of nongken 58s under sd and ld conditions during the male sterility transition. the repressive expression profile under ld conditions identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes . gene ontology  and pathway analysis of the degs revealed that the circadian rhythm and the flowering pathways were involved in the male sterility transition. in further analysis, qpcr results indicated that the circadian rhythms of osprr <dig>  osprr <dig>  osgi, hd <dig>  oslhy and osdof in nongken 58s were significantly different from those in nongken  <dig>  this suggests that the circadian rhythm and the flowering pathways were coordinately involved in regulation of the male sterility transition.

methods
plant materials
the varieties nongken  <dig> and the mutant nongken 58s  were used for this study. all plants were grown under natural conditions at wuhan university campus. sd  treatment was conducted when the seedlings had greater than five leaves. differentiation from vegetative growth to reproductive growth was promoted after 10- <dig> days of sd treatment. when the inflorescences had developed to the secondary branch differentiation stage, the rice plants were divided into two groups for ld  and sd treatment, respectively.

rna isolation and cdna synthesis
for total rna isolation, the second fully expanded leaf was harvested at two developmental stages: glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium formation. for diurnal expression profile analysis, the leaves were harvested at  <dig> h intervals over  <dig> day, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°c until use  <cit> . the samples are annotated in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

a trizol reagent kit  was used for total rna isolation following the manufacturer's instructions. total rna was treated with rnase-free dnase i  to remove dna contamination before cdna synthesis. two micrograms of total rna and oligo  were used as template and primers for first strand cdna synthesis by m-mlv reverse transcriptase .

microarray analysis procedure and comparison strategy
two micrograms of total rna were used for double-stranded cdna synthesis, and biotin-tagged crna was prepared using a messageamp™ ii crna amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. the resulting bio-tagged crna was fragmented into strands of 35- <dig> bases according to affymetrix protocols. the fragmented crna was hybridised to an affymetrix genechip rice genome array containing  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts representing the japonica and indica cultivars, respectively. the microarray and data analysis were contracted to capitalbio corporation . the hybridisation was performed at 45°c with rotation for  <dig> h . the genechip arrays were washed and then stained  on an affymetrix fluidics station  <dig>  scanning was conducted using a genechip scanner  <dig>  all chip data represented biological triplicates.

the scanned images were examined by visual inspection and then processed to generate raw data using the default setting of genechip operating software . dchip software was used to perform invariant-set normalization to normalize the arrays according to dchip users' manual. 5% of perfect-match  probe signals were used as background removal. annotation of the samples is shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the samples were compared as follows: g-ssd <dig> vs. g-sld <dig> and p-ssd <dig> vs. p-sld <dig>  the criteria for determining up- and down-regulated genes were fold changes  of ≥  <dig> and ≤  <dig> , respectively. the complete microarray data have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

cluster, gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis
all microarray data were analysed using significant analysis of microarray   <dig>  software. genes with fc ≥  <dig> or fc ≤  <dig>  were chosen for the t-test, and genes with p values <  <dig>  were chosen for further analysis. cluster analysis was performed using cluster  <dig>  software. go annotation was performed using the geneontology enrichment analysis software toolkit   <cit> . gos with p values <  <dig>  were selected. pathway analysis was accomplished using the mas  <dig>  system   and by searching the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, biocarta and genmapp databases. pathways with p values <  <dig>  were selected.

quantitative pcr analysis
for quantitative pcr, the cycling conditions were 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s and 60°c for  <dig> s, and then a melting curve from 60°c to 95°c in  <dig> °c increments. negative controls without the template dna were used to ensure that primer dimers were not interfering with amplification. qpcr data was captured and analysed using stepone software . the relative gene expression levels in each cdna sample were obtained by normalisation to actin <dig> using the formula 2-  <cit> . the primers used in this study are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  all qpcr data is the result of biological triplicates.

RESULTS
dynamic transcriptome profiling of photoperiod treatment during the male sterility transition
as shown in figure  <dig>  pollen abortion was induced in nongken 58s under ld conditions  from the glume primordium differentiation to the pollen mother cell forming stages   <cit> . under sd conditions , the pollen partially regained fertility . by contrast, pollen fertility in nongken  <dig> was not affected . these results indicated that the fertility of pgms could not be completely restored using normal photoperiod conditions, implying that some defective signaling pathway may be constitutively affected. to investigate the transcriptome changes during the male sterility transition process in pgms rice, we chose the leaves, light signal receiver, as experimental material at photoperiod-sensitive stage. based on preliminary experiments, the diurnal expression profiles of those genes peaked at 02: <dig> h . thus, 02: <dig> h was selected as the expression profile time point for the microarray. affymetrix genechips were used for global transcriptome profiling analysis. the correlation coefficients between different biological repeats were calculated, and the result indicates that the profilings were reproducible . a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were detected p values <  <dig>  in the comparison of g-ssd <dig> vs. g-sld <dig> and p-ssd <dig> vs. p-sld <dig>  respectively. in comparing the sd and ld conditions at the two developmental stages,  <dig> degs with two fold changes were detected p <  <dig> .

the degs were categorised using cluster  <dig>  software . the number of degs with fc ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig>  increased significantly as inflorescence development proceeded . at the glume primordium differentiation and the pistil/stamen primordium forming stages,  <dig> and  <dig> degs with fc ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig>   were detected, respectively . five genes were identified as markedly up-regulated  and two genes were noted as considerably down-regulated  under sd conditions at the glume primordium stage . twenty-two genes were considerably up-regulated , and only five genes were down-regulated  at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage . these results indicated that more genes were suppressed than were activated under ld conditions. this suggests that transcriptome profiling in nongken 58s was significantly suppressed, and the repression effects were markedly intensified as inflorescence development proceeded. this is consistent with previous studies in which pollen fertility was found to decrease as ld treatment increased  <cit> .

defining degs for go annotation and pathway analysis
to annotate the degs, the sequences were uploaded to the goeast website for go annotation analysis  <cit> . the results indicated that some biological processes were significantly affected during the second photoperiod under ld conditions. four go biological processes related to the regulation of the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase , the regulation of sd photoperiodism , the photoperiodism , and inflorescence development  were investigated during the second photoperiod . the results implied that these processes were related to the male sterility transition in pgms rice.

1degs with fc ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  were chosen for go annotation.

2go terms with p <  <dig>  are listed in the table.

to define the potential signal transduction pathways, the degs were uploaded to the mas  <dig>  system. five pathways and seven pathways were identified from the transcriptome data for g-ssd <dig> vs. g-sld <dig> and p-ssd <dig> vs. p-sld <dig>  respectively . the circadian rhythm pathway was top ranked  in both inflorescence developmental stages . the results indicated that three genes, osprr <dig> , oslhy  and myb transcription factor , belong to the circadian rhythm pathway. this suggests that the circadian rhythm may be a principal signal transduction pathway in the male sterility transition in pgms.

1degs with fc ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  were chosen for pathway analysis.

 <dig> pathways with p <  <dig>  are listed in the table.

circadian rhythm involvement in the male sterility transition
as mentioned previously, several clock genes  were identified . among these genes, osprr <dig> and osgi were up-regulated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively; oslhy and the myb transcription factor were down-regulated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. no difference in osprr <dig> expression was detected in the g-ssd <dig> vs. g-sld <dig> data ; in the p-ssd <dig> vs. p-sld <dig> data, osprr <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold and the myb transcription factor was down-regulated  <dig> -fold. no differences in osprr <dig>  osgi and oslhy were detected at this inflorescence developmental stage. the fold changes indicate that these clock genes were activated or repressed under ld conditions in nongken 58s, implying that they may participate in the male sterility transition.

because gene transcription is dynamic, the microarray data reflect expression differences at 02: <dig> h only. therefore, the diurnal expression profiles of these genes were analysed in both nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> at the glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium forming stages under ld and sd conditions. osprr <dig>  osprr <dig> and osgi exhibited the similar circadian rhythm patterns under ld conditions . for three of these genes, the differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> only occurred at 18: <dig> h at the glume primordium differentiation stage. the expression levels in nongken 58s were significantly higher than in nongken  <dig>  no difference was found at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage under ld and sd conditions . these results indicate a circadian rhythm difference in the expression of the three genes between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig>  <cit> .

oslhy, a dawn-phased gene, is repressed during the day and activated at night. its expression level differed significantly between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> at 22: <dig> h, 02: <dig> h, 06: <dig> h at the glume primordium differentiation stage, and 06: <dig> h at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage . however, no difference was detected under sd conditions . the results also indicated circadian rhythm differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig>  osdof , a dof-type zinc finger , showed a similar diurnal pattern to oslhy. the major differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> occurred at 22: <dig> h and 02: <dig> h at the glume primordium differentiation stage, and at 22: <dig> h, 02: <dig> h, and 06: <dig> h at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage .

taken together, these differences only occurred under ld conditions at the photoperiod-sensitive developmental stage. based on the genetic background of nongken 58s and nongken  <dig>  these genes were all related to the male sterility transition and the rice circadian rhythm was involved in this process.

flowering gene hd <dig> is involved in the male sterility transition under ld conditions
ehd <dig>  hd3a, rft <dig> and osmads <dig> were all significantly suppressed under ld conditions in nongken 58s . ehd <dig>  hd3a, rft <dig> are crucial genes for rice flowering  <cit> , and osmads <dig> plays key roles in specifying floral organ and meristem identity in rice  <cit> . ehd <dig> and hd <dig> are also important components of the flowering pathway. to determine whether these genes were involved in the male sterility transition, the diurnal expression profiles of these genes were analysed. hd <dig> was the only gene exhibiting different daily expression profiles between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> under ld conditions . the main differences occurred at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage. the transcription levels at 22: <dig> h and 06: <dig> h in nongken 58s were significantly different from those in nongken  <dig>  indicating that the peak phase of hd <dig> was at 06: <dig> h in nongken  <dig> and it was shifted forward to 22: <dig> h in nongken 58s. the phase is a mathematical term of plant circadian rhythms  <cit> . the phase-shift indicated that the circadian rhythm of hd <dig> in nongken 58s was notably different from that in nongken  <dig>  while the flowering time of nongken  <dig> is similar to that of nongken 58s under ld conditions. this suggests that hd <dig> plays a role in the male sterility transition in pgms.

osprr <dig> and hd <dig> were differentially expressed in the inflorescences of nongken 58s and nongken 58
because of light signals received from the leaf, knowledge of the expression profiles of degs in the inflorescence is essential. further qpcr of the expression patterns of these genes in the inflorescence showed that osprr <dig>  osgi, oslhy, osdof expression was similar in nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> under ld and sd conditions . only osprr <dig> and hd <dig> were differentially expressed in the inflorescences of nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> at the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage . the expression level of osprr <dig> in nongken 58s was significantly lower than that in nongken  <dig> at 17: <dig> h under ld conditions , and the level of osprr <dig> was significantly lower than that in nongken  <dig> at 20: <dig> h under sd conditions . the expression level of hd <dig> in nongken 58s was significantly greater than that in nongken  <dig> at 20: <dig> h and 02: <dig> h under ld conditions , but was significantly lower than that in nongken at 20: <dig> h. however, the transcription level in nongken 58s at 02: <dig> h was higher than that in nongken  <dig>  these results suggest that osprr <dig> and hd <dig> are likely involved in the male sterility transition directly under ld conditions in the inflorescence. moreover, the differences under sd conditions suggest a potential explanation for why pollen fertility cannot be completely recovered under sd in nongken 58s.

discussion
circadian rhythm and light signals have been reported to be involved in several physiological processes, including flowering, various stress responses and metabolism  <cit> . however, this is the first report suggesting a role for circadian rhythm and flowering signals in the regulation network of male sterility. in general, these genes promote the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth under sd conditions in sd plants and under ld conditions in ld plants  <cit> . although the male sterility transition in pgms rice is known to be regulated by ld conditions, the mechanism of regulation remains unknown. global gene expression profiling under ld conditions revealed a suppressive trend and categorised into the circadian rhythm and flowering pathways. both pathways regulate the process in a coordinated manner. further studies revealed that the diurnal expression profiles of osprr <dig>  osprr <dig>  osgi, oslhy, osdof and hd <dig> under ld conditions were reprogrammed.

in this study, osprr <dig>  osprr <dig> and osgi exhibited similar expression patterns in the leaf under ld conditions, suggesting that these three genes may function together. oslhy and osdof also exhibit similar differentially expressed patterns, suggesting that they may function coordinately. in arabidopsis, toc1/prr <dig>  lhy and gi, key component factors in the central clock, comprise interlocked transcriptional feedback loops to regulate plant circadian rhythms  <cit> . in pgms rice, osprr <dig>  oslhy and osgi were not only involved in the circadian rhythm, but were also involved in the male sterility transition in coordination with osprr <dig> and osdof. the ld signals maybe integrated and transmitted to the downstream genes through rice central clock in leaves. the day length signal may have been transmitted to the inflorescence via hd <dig> and osprr <dig>  ultimately leading to pollen abortion.

in the rice flowering pathway, osgi is upstream of hd <dig> and is positively correlated with hd <dig> expression. hd <dig> is activated by osgi under ld or sd conditions. hd <dig> activates hd3a/rft <dig> expression under sd conditions to promote flowering. however, hd <dig> suppresses hd3a/rft <dig> expression under ld conditions to inhibit flowering  <cit> . in pgms rice, hd <dig> expression may also have a positive correlation with osgi under ld conditions in nongken 58s, as its expression was activated after osgi expression . this implies that hd <dig> may function downstream of osgi in the male sterility transition in pgms rice. in this case, hd3a/rft <dig> may not be the downstream regulator of hd <dig> since there were no rhythm differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig>  hd <dig> was activated by osgi under ld conditions and suppressed the unknown factors. this may influence downstream gene expression and finally affect male fertility.

in leaves, the diurnal expression patterns of osprr <dig>  osprr <dig>  osgi, oslhy, osdof and hd <dig> showed significant differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig>  in the inflorescence, only osprr <dig> and hd <dig> exhibited different expression patterns between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> under both ld and sd. therefore, it is speculated that the clock genes in leaves may function as sensors for day length. these genes may receive day length signals and integrate and transmit the signals into the inflorescence through a series of unknown pathways. both osprr <dig> and hd <dig> may be the effectors in the inflorescence, and they are likely involved in regulation of male sterility directly.

previous studies have indicated that phytochromes and cryptochromes are involved in the male sterility transition. however, there were no diurnal expression differences in osphya, osphyb, oscry1a, oscry1b, oscry <dig> and oscry <dig> under ld conditions between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> . using an elisa assay, wang, et al. found that phya content in nongken 58s leaves was higher than in nongken  <dig> under the identical day length treatment  <cit> . the differences in phytochromes and cryptochromes may be at the protein level and needs further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the transcriptome of nongken 58s was significantly suppressed and the repression effects were markedly intensified when inflorescence development proceeded. rice circadian rhythm genes osprr <dig>  osprr <dig>  osgi, oslhy and osdof and the flowering gene hd <dig> were coordinately involved in signal transduction in leaves. furthermore, hd <dig> and osprr <dig> may be signal sensors in inflorescences to directly affect the male sterility transition.
