BACKGROUND
ultrasound imaging technology has wide applications in cattle reproduction and has been used to monitor individual follicles and determine the patterns of follicular development  <cit> . the adoption of ultrasound imaging technology in cattle reproduction can provide an effective way to understand a number of issues on bovine reproductive cycle and its concurrent disorders  <cit> . for example, with the help of ultrasound imaging technology, it is now known that follicular growth occurs in wave-like patterns during each estrous cycle  <cit> . ultrasound imaging technology also provides a tool for understanding the influence of dominant follicles on medium and small follicles  <cit> .

in the applications of ultrasound imaging to monitoring individual follicles and determining the patterns of follicular development, the acquisition of the measurements of the individual follicles such as diameters, areas and perimeters is very important. in order to acquire the measurements of an individual follicle, image segmentation techniques are often used to extract the individual follicles. however, speckles in ultrasound images affect the segmentation and finally affect the measurement of the follicles. speckle noise, seen as a granular structure, is caused by the interaction between the ultrasound waves and the scatters within the tissue  <cit> . the inherent nature of speckles makes its removal difficult. speckle noise is not an additive noise, but is considered as a kind of multiplicative noise  <cit>  <cit> . many speckle reduction technologies have been proposed. in  <cit> , a laplacian pyramid-based nonlinear diffusion  is presented for medical ultrasound imaging. in the proposed method, the image is first decomposed into multi-layer laplacian pyramid and speckles are removed by nonlinear diffusion filtering of bandpass ultrasound images in laplacian pyramid domain. in  <cit> , a nonlinear multiscale wavelet diffusion for speckle reduction is proposed. speckles are suppressed by employing the iterative multiscale diffusion on the wavelet coefficients. in  <cit> , a speckle reduction algorithm---speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion  is proposed. the proposed algorithm has good performance in the preservation of edges and speckle reduction.

in this paper, we will investigate using bilateral filter to reduce the speckles in ultrasound images for cattle follicle segmentation. it is well known that bilateral filter has good performance in noise reduction and edge preservation. however, current existing bilateral filters are mainly used for additive noise reduction. it is not effective when it is applied to speckles, which are generally modelled as multiplicative noise. in order to solve this issue, we propose an adaptive bilateral filter, which can reduce the speckles effectively.

methods
bilateral filter
bilateral filter was developed by tomasi and manduchi  <cit> . the basic idea of bilateral filter is to replace a pixel value in an image by a weighted mean of its neighbors, which the weights depend on both the spatial distance and the intensity distance  <cit>  <cit> . there are many types of bilateral filters depending on the choice of weighting functions. what we develop in this paper is based on the gaussian bilateral filter  <cit>  <cit> . for gaussian bilateral filter, it can be expressed mathematically as  <cit>  <cit> 

       

where  is the output pixel value, j  is the input pixel values, x and y are the coordinates vectors, σ

       

in the above equation, when x and y are 2-d vectors, the bilateral filter is called 2-d bilateral filter, which can be used to reduce the noise in 2-d images.

bilateral filter is a good choice for image de-noising because it is stable and simple. the effectiveness of bilateral filter lies in the combined use of the domain filter, which is used to enforce spatial closeness by weighting pixel values with coefficients that fall off with distance  <cit> , and the range filter, which assigns greater coefficients to those neighbouring pixels with light intensity that is more similar to the centre pixel value  <cit> . in bilateral filter, the choice of the parameters σ

speckle reducing bilateral filter
generally speaking, noise can be modelled by an additive model or a multiplicative model. additive noise model is the simpler case of the two and can be described by a linear model

j = i + n     

where j is the noised image, i is the original image and n is the noise. multiplicative noise is generally expressed by a multiplicative model

j  = i  * n     

it is well known that multiplicative noise appears much worse in bright image regions than dark regions since it multiplies the gray intensities.

speckle noise is generally treated as multiplicative noise and can be modelled using equation . thus, compared with other types of noise, speckle noise is generally difficult to be removed. our research below shows that the conventional bilateral filter described in equation  and  generally gets bad results when it is applied to speckle reduction directly. thus, the bilateral filter described in  and  needs improvement or enhancement so that it can be applied to reduce the speckles in images effectively. in order to do this, we will first analyze the behavior of  of the bilateral filter in equation  in a homogenous region for both additive noise and multiplicative noise, then we will propose an adaptive bilateral filter for speckle reduction.

let j and j be two different pixels from image j. if j is corrupted by additive noise, then we can use equation  to compute the difference between these two pixels

||j - j|| = ||i + n -i - n||     

if both j and j are from the same homogenous region, then we have i = i, thus

||j - j|| = ||n - n||     

equation  means that the difference between any two pixels from the same homogenous region is only related to the difference of the noise. if j is corrupted by multiplicative noise, then we can use equation  to compute the difference between these two pixels. from equation , we have

||j - j|| = ||i * n - i * n||     

similarly, if both j and j are from the same homogenous region, then we have i = i, thus

||j - j || = ||i||||n - n||     

from equation , we can understand that the difference between two pixels in the same homogenous region is not only related to the difference of the noise. it also depends on the intensity of the region. as is seen in equation , the difference is big when the intensity of the region is big while the difference is small when the intensity of the image is small.

the above analysis shows the bilateral filter described in  and  is not suitable for removing speckle noise, which is multiplicative noise. the reason lies in the difference of the corrupted image has different distributions in different homogenous regions. for example, if σ

       

equation  shows that the normalized difference is only related to the noise and doesn’t depend on the intensities of the region. thus, the proposed adaptive bilateral filter can be expressed as follows

       

where

       

bilateral filter is famous because it is non-iterative, however, the non-iterative bilateral filter doesn’t yield good results. in order to improve its effectiveness, we use iterative bilateral filter. the basic idea of iterative bilateral filter is to use the filtered image obtained by equation  as the input of equation  and implement it many times, the mathematical expression is as follows:

       

where

       

where . experiments show that iterative bilateral filter gives much better results than the non-iterative bilateral filter.

cattle follicle segmentation
in order to analyze and monitor the reproduction of cattle, the acquisition of some quantitative parameters is very important. these parameters include diameters, areas and perimeters of the follicles. these parameters can be used to monitor the development and maturity of follicles. in order to get these parameters, we need to segment the follicles.

many image segmentation methods have been proposed, which includes histogram based methods, edge detection based methods, region based methods, active contour model based methods, etc. active contour model based methods have drawn a lot of attention in the past decade because of their significant advantages. in this paper, we adopt active contour model based method for the segmentation of the follicles. an active contour or a snake  <cit>  is defined as a controlled continuity contour that is attracted to salient image features. however, there are some disadvantages related to the original model. thus, many improved active models have been proposed based on the original model. the gradient vector flow  model is one of them  <cit>  <cit> . gvf model is designed to overcome one of the disadvantages of original model, i.e. the original model is sensitive to the initialization of the snake. in gvf model, gvf fields are computed by another diffusion process, which can be implemented by minimizing the following energy function  <cit>  <cit> :

       

where g is a decreasing function of the edge-force magnitude and is defined as follows:

       

here k is a non-negative smoothing parameter for the field . the functional described by equation  smoothes the force field  only when the edge strength is low. solving the energy functional optimization problem in , we can obtain the generalized gradient vector flow, which can be used as external forces that attract the snake to the follicle boundary  <cit>  <cit> .

gvf provides external forces for a snake model, we also need internal forces to smooth the contour. in this paper, we use b-spline to represent the contour instead of the real internal forces. b-spline has been used in snake model in several applications and get pretty good results  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> . let the control points be denoted by p <dig> through pm. the knot-value sequence is a non-decreasing sequence of knot values t <dig> through tm+ <dig>  and qi is a curve segment defined by control points pi- <dig>  pi- <dig>  pi- <dig>  pi and blending functions bi- <dig> , bi- <dig> , bi- <dig>   <dig>  bi,  <dig>  as follows  <cit> :


where  <dig> ≤ i ≤ m and ti ≤ t ≤ ti+ <dig>  the blending functions can be obtained using recursion as follows  <cit> :

       

       

when p= <dig>  we obtained the blending function of cubic splines. the gvf snake with b-spline is called b-spline gvf snake  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> .

for the segmentation of the follicles, we initialize the b-spline gvf snake using a circle inside each follicle. the circle is represented by b-spline and the number of control points is set to  <dig> in this paper. then, starting from the initial contour, the gvf is used to drive the contour to the boundary of the follicle. the evolution of the contours is the same as that in the b-spline gvf snake in single scale proposed by  <cit> .

RESULTS
results from synthetic images
to test the effectiveness of the proposed bilateral filter, we used both conventional bilateral filter and the proposed bilateral filter to process the synthetic image with speckles and compare the results. fig. <dig> is the original image and fig.  <dig>  is the corrupted image by speckles with mean  <dig> and variance  <dig> . in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter and evaluate its performance in speckle reduction and edge preservation, we employed three measures in the experiments for comparison. these three measures are: normalized mean square error , noise suppression measure α and edge preservation parameter β <cit> . the nmse is defined as  <cit> 

       

where i <dig> and i are the original image and the corrupted image, respectively, n is the pixel number of the image i <dig>  i,  and  are the means of i and i <dig>  respectively. the nmse generally represents the difference between the original image and the processed image. the noise reduction measure is defined as  <cit> 

       

where

       

the edge preservation parameter is given by  <cit> 

       

where Δ is the laplacian operator. higher α and β represent better performance in noise reduction and edge preservation.

the conventional bilateral filter and the proposed bilateral filter were applied to process the speckled images. in both filters, σ

fig. <dig> and  <dig> are the best results obtained by the conventional bilateral filter with σ

all of the above experiments show that the proposed bilateral filter can achieve better performance in noise removal and edge preservation than the conventional bilateral filter.

results from real ultrasound images
in this subsection, we will compare the proposed bilateral filter with gaussian filter and the conventional bilateral filter in speckle reduction using real ultrasound images. fig. <dig> shows the original image and the results obtained by the three filters. although gaussian filter may reduce the speckles in the images as seen in fig. <dig> , the edges and details are very blurred. the useful details in the processed image ) obtained by the conventional bilateral filter are retained, but there are still many speckles. in fig. <dig> , we know that the proposed filter can reduce speckles effectively while preserve useful edges and details.

to compare and evaluate the three filters quantitatively, we used them to reduce the speckles in real ultrasound image and then calculated the contrast of the homogenous region and edges in the image. a good filter should preserve the edges and reduce speckles in the image, which means the contrast in homogenous region should be low while the contrast in edges should be high. the contrast measure used in this paper is the measure adopted in  <cit> , which is defined as

       

where c, the local contrast at pixel , is the laplacian operation

c = 4i - {i + i + i + i} 

where i is the pixel intensity value at pixel  of an image, w is a region or a set of edge points, and m is the number of the pixels in the region or edge points.

fig. <dig> illustrates the contrast values in the preselected homogenous regions and the preselected sets of edge points of  <dig> follicle images. for the homogenous regions, fig.  <dig>  shows that the contrast values of the regions obtained by gaussian filter are smaller than those obtained by the conventional bilateral filter or the proposed bilateral filter. besides, the proposed bilateral filter obtained the smallest contrast values . these results show that the proposed bilateral filter can achieve the best performance in speckle reduction in homogenous regions. for the set of edge points, fig. <dig>  shows that gaussian filter has the smallest contrast values, which indicates that most of the edges have been smeared out. although the conventional bilateral filter has higher contrast values in the set of edge points, the proposed filter has the biggest contrast values, which means it has higher performance in edge preservation.

after the images were processed, we applied b-spline snake  <cit>  to extract the boundaries of the follicles. fig. <dig> shows the experimental results. fig. <dig> ,,,and  show the boundaries of the follicles extracted by b-spline snake from the original images, the images processed by gaussian filter, the contional bilateral filter and the proposed filter, respectively. fig. <dig> shows that the final contour is away from the boundary of the follicle due to the speckles. although there are less speckles in fig. <dig>  the final contour is also away from the real boundary because the edges are blurred by gaussian filter. the result of fig. <dig> is very close to the real boundary of the follicle than the contour in fig. <dig> and fig. <dig>  but it is still affected by speckles. fig. <dig>  shows that b-spline snake can accurately locate the real boundary of the follicle filtered by the proposed algorithm.

in order to evaluate the segmentation results, we adopted the segmentation metric, pratt's quality measurement metric , which is defined as  <cit> 

       

where ia is the number of boundary pixels delineated by an automatic segmentation method, ii is the number of boundary pixels delineated by the technicians. d is the euclidean distance between a boundary pixel of ground truth or delineated by the technicians and the nearest boundary pixel extracted by automatic segmentation, and γ is a scaling constant.

fig. <dig> shows the fom values of the  <dig> images processed by different filters. we can see that the gaussian filter could improve segmentation, the conventional bilateral filter and the proposed filter achieved better fom values than gaussian filter. however, the proposed bilateral filter outperformed the other two filters.
