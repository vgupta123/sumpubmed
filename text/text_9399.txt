BACKGROUND
eslicarbazepine acetate  is a once-daily anticonvulsant approved in  <dig> by the european medicines agency  and in  <dig> by the food and drug administration  as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures . the esl epilepsy clinical program included an initial proof of concept phase ii study  <cit>  and four subsequent phase iii studies in patients refractory to conventional antiepileptic drug  therapy  <cit> . long-term safety and maintenance of therapeutic effect was demonstrated in one-year open-label extensions of these studies  <cit> .

following oral administration, esl undergoes extensive first pass hydrolysis to its major active metabolite eslicarbazepine -licarbazepine)  <cit> , which represents approximately 95% of circulating active moieties and is believed to be responsible for its antiseizure effects  <cit>  most likely through reduction of vgsc availability due to enhancement of slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and blockade type t calcium channels  <cit> .

latrunculin a is an actin depolymerization agent  <cit>  that has been widely used to study the role of f-actin in anchoring nmda receptors to synaptic sites  <cit> . latrunculin a treatment promotes neurotransmitter release in hippocampal synapses  <cit>  and induces multiple action potential firing and increases action potential duration  <cit> . latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion in freely moving rats induces acute epileptic seizures, followed by the occurrence of chronic sporadic spontaneous seizures, in association with changes in extracellular concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids  <cit> . in the rat, esl was found to prevent acute seizures induced by latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion and reduce the increases in glutamate and aspartate induced by latrunculin a  <cit> . however, rats, in contrast to mice and humans, extensively convert esl to oxcarbazepine  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of esl on the development of latrunculin a hippocampal perfusion-induced acute and chronic seizure model in the mouse and to further examine the effects upon hippocampal extracellular levels of taurine, glycine, aspartate, gaba and glutamate, as changes in the extracellular levels of these amino acids play determinant effects in the neuropathophysiology of epileptic seizures  <cit> . mice were used for the experiments as the metabolism of esl in this species reflects the situation observed in humans  <cit> .

RESULTS
mes test
male nmri mice  were administered mes  via corneal electrodes connected to a constant current shock generator  and the number of tonic convulsions recorded. esl  decreased in dose dependent manner mes-induced seizures  with an ed <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg. following oral administration of esl, the major metabolite in plasma obtained from a statelite group of mice was eslicarbazepine, followed by relatively low amounts of oxc ; no trace amounts of esl and r-licarbazepine were detected. the esl dose of 100 mg/kg administered 60 min before the test resulted in 90% protection against mes-induced seizures. the concentration of eslicarbazepine in plasma associated with the 90% protection against mes-induced seizures was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/ml. because this dose of esl was found not to affect the behavioural performance in the rotarod test , subsquent experiments  were performed with the 100 mg/kg esl dose.figure  <dig>

eeg and behavioral observations
no seizures were observed during the first and second day of latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion. however, all animals  studied showed a variable number of seizures  on the third day of latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion. esl , administered 5–10 min before starting latrunculin a hippocampal perfusion, completely prevented latrunculin a induced seizures in all mice studied.

during the first week after latrunculin a treatment no behavioral signs or paroxysmal eeg activity was observed, though sporadic periods of slow waves were observed. from the second week onwards, various eeg signals of paroxysmal activity  were recorded in all animals studied. three different types of paroxysmal activity were observed in the same animal : 1) short bilateral electrographic seizure appearing sporadically during the second week after latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion ; 2) focal spike discharges observed the third week after latrunculin a treatment, not related to observable behavioral signs; 3) slow waves/polyspikes observed during the third and fourth day of control .figure  <dig>

eeg epileptiform activity during the four weeks following latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion was summarized weekly according to time spent  in bilateral spike and wave discharges, focal discharges or slow wave activity . among the mice studied, electrographic seizures and discharges occurred far more frequently than corresponding behavioral seizures could be detected. one tonic-clonic seizure was observed in two of the animals studied during behavioral observation, but no eeg records were obtained. bilateral spike and wave discharges, focal discharges or slow wave activity resulting from latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion were significantly lower in esl-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice .figure  <dig>

in the animals treated with esl, no paroxysmal eeg activity was observed during wakefulness and sleep in the month following latrunculin a microperfusion . no observable seizures or behavioural abnormalities were observed during the continuous video recordings of esl-treated animals.figure  <dig>

the inter-rater variability in the assessment of videotaped seizures and behavioral changes was approximately 2%.

extracellular amino acid levels
hippocampal extracellular aspartate , glutamate , glycine , gaba and taurine  were obtained with a 4-mm microdialysis membrane at a flow rate of 2 μl/min and were corrected for probe recovery. the recovery of asp, glu, gly, gaba and tau across the dialysis membrane was determined by perfusing modified ringer solution at a rate of 2 μl/min through standard amino acid solutions ranging from  <dig>  to 100 mm. samples were collected every 15 min and determined as described. relative probe recovery values  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for asp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for glu,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for gly,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for gaba and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tau.

basal dialysate concentrations  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/l for asp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/l for glu,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/l for gly,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/l for gaba and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/l for tau. as shown in figure  <dig>  latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion induced significant  increases in extracellular concentrations of gly and tau on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion, as well as a significant  decrease in gaba levels, when were compared to control animals. asp concentrations were significnatly  increased during day  <dig> of perfusion. glu levels remained unchanged during the two first days of perfusion, but decreased during the third day . the treatment with esl prevented the latrunculin a-induced increase in gly, asp and tau microdialysate concentrations . though perfusion with latrunculin a did not affect extracellular concentrations of glu during the first 2 days of treatment, esl nevertheless markedly decreased the concentrations of glu in the microdialysate of latrunculin a perfused mice during days  <dig>  and  <dig> . on the other hand, the marked decrease in gaba concentrations in the microdialysate of latrunculin a perfused mice was not affected by esl administration.figure  <dig>

taking into account that seizures develop on the third day of perfusion, the main changes associated with the epileptiform eeg activity were decreases in gaba and glu concentrations as well as significant increases in gly and tau.

esl and metabolite pharmacokinetics
following oral administration of esl , the major metabolite in brain and plasma was eslicarbazepine. relatively low amounts of oxc were quantified in brain and plasma. only trace amounts of esl were detected in brain and no r-licarbazepine was detected. eslicarbazepine reached maximal concentrations  between  <dig>  to 4 h following administration and at 8 h eslicarbazepine was in the elimination phase, reaching undetectable levels 24 h following administration . previously, esl was tested in mice at 20 mg/kg  <cit> . in the present study we tested a dose of esl  <dig> fold that previously tested. the plasma and brain profile of esl and metabolites is similar in the two studies.figure  <dig>

discussion
the present study determined the effects of esl on epileptogenesis in the mouse latrunculin a model. moreover, brain amino acid concentrations in the hippocampal microdialysates and esl and metabolites in brain and plasma pharmacokinetic data were obtained for the pretreatment times and administration routes used in the present study. as previously described for mice  <cit> , esl was extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, as has been observed in humans  <cit> . in contrast to mice and humans, rats extensively convert esl to oxcarbazepine  <cit> . esl significantly prevented latrunculin a-induced seizures and significantly prevented chronic paroxysmal eeg activity in hippocampal latrunculin a-perfused mice. these data indicate that esl inhibits seizure initiation and can protect against latrunculin a-induced epileptogenesis. this dose of esl , which significantly increased the seizure threshold in latrunculin a-perfused mice, was similar to the dose that prevented the development of seizures in the maximal electroshock test, and on partial-onset seizures in corneal and amygdala kindling models  <cit> .

these results suggest that esl and eslicarbazepine  have the potential to prevent latrunculin a-induced epileptogenesis. the observed effects may reflect an anticonvulsant effect on partial onset seizures. however, disease-modifying effects may also be involved. the mechanisms of latrunculin a convulsant action are not completely understood, but the increase in the extracellular concentrations of excitatory amino acids acting on nmda glutamate receptors, such as glu, asp and gly, seem to be involved in latrunculin a-induced changes in seizure threshold  <cit> . it has been suggested that changes in extracellular hippocampal glu, asp and gaba levels are not involved in seizure onset, but may play a role in seizure maintenance and/or spread in some animal models of epilepsy  <cit> . in fact, high concentrations of glu and gly are convulsant in rats treated with intrahippocampal microperfusion of latrunculin a. this effect can be reversed by nmda antagonists  <cit> , indicating that increased glu and gly extracellular levels may be involved in seizure initiation in latrunculin a-induced seizures. the present study in mice shows that changes in extracellular concentrations of brain amino acids during latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion are not identical to that observed in rats  <cit> . this is particularly relevant for glu, where no increase in the extracellular concentrations were observed in the mouse. another interesting difference between the rat and the mouse relates to the marked decrease in the extracellular concentrations of gaba in latrunculin a-treated mice, which did not occur in the rat  <cit> . the differences between species in what relates to changes in the extracellular concentrations of glu and gaba during latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion, for which no particular reason is apparent, do not appear to play a relevant role with respect to induction of seizures. however, it can be hypothesized that the decrease in the extracellular concentrations of gaba during latrunculin a hippocampal microperfusion may play a role in seizure initiation, maintenance and arrest  <cit> . on the other hand, the latrunculin a-induced increase in the extracellular concentrations of asp and gly appear to be common features in rats and mice. the observation that esl treatment prevented latrunculin a-induced increases in the extracellular concentrations of asp and gly, without changes in gaba levels, and the development of chronic seizures indicates that the drug may not merely suppress seizure activity but may also inhibit the generation of a constant hyperexcitable epileptic network, resulting in decreases in the extracellular levels of excitatory brain amino acids.

the delayed appearance of bilateral spike and wave discharges, focal discharges or slow wave activity may result from changes in receptor signalling or changes in synaptic connectivity of surviving cells. multiple changes occur in the days and weeks after convulsant application. long-term changes in receptor expression have been documented at both excitatory  <cit>  and inhibitory synapses  <cit> . reactive changes have also been demonstrated in the expression, phosphorylation and distribution of membrane channels that regulate cellular excitability  <cit> .

esl is only hydrolysed to eslicarbazepine in humans and mice  <cit> , whereas oxcarbazepine serves as a prodrug of both 10-hydroxy metabolites, i.e. eslicarbazepine and -licarbazepine, which appear in the plasma and urine in a 4: <dig> ratio  <cit> . in this context, it is of specific interest to compare the brain availability of both enantiomers. whereas eslicarbazepine was the major metabolite in brain and plasma, -licarbazepine represented less than 1% of the total amount of esl metabolites in brain. these data fit well with the finding that eslicarbazepine was more potent in the mes test as compared to the -enantiomer  <cit> . though -licarbazepine is endowed with effects as an active voltage-gated sodium channel  blocker  <cit> , this may not suffice to guarantee efficacy of this entity as an anticonvulsant. considerable differences in the pharmacodynamic properties between eslicarbazepine and -licarbazepine have been observed. the affinity of -licarbazepine for vgscs in the resting state versus the inactive was found to be 4-fold that for eslicarbazepine  <cit> , which may favor a better efficacy of the later over the former. another remarkable difference between eslicarbazepine and -licarbazepine is concerned with the potency of -licarbazepine as a blocker of voltage-gated potassium-channels, namely kv <dig>  currents, whereas eslicarbazepine is devoid of effect  <cit> . in fact, activation of voltage-gated potassium-channels  during the initial stages of an action potential discharge suppresses later action potentials and inhibition of channel activity strongly enhances repetitive firing  <cit> . kv <dig>  knock-out mice have a reduced electroconvulsive threshold and increased sensitivity to convulsing agents  <cit> . finally, eslicarbazepine, but not -licarbazepine, was effective in retarding kindling development during bilateral corneal stimulation in mice  <cit> . this potential for eslicarbazepine to elicit antiepileptogenic effects, in contrast to -licarbazepine, may relate to the ability of eslicarbazepine to effectively inhibit high and low affinity cav <dig>  inward currents  <cit> .

numerous animal models of epileptogenesis have been developed and used in research studies designed to increase our understanding on the molecular abnormalities underlying neuronal hyperexcitability and spontaneous seizures  <cit> . the latrunculin a-induced acute and chronic seizure model is an alternative model for studying epileptogenesis, as seizures are not the consequence of a previous sstatus epilepticus, but rather depend on the long-term changes in neuronal excitability leading to the onset of sporadic spontaneous seizures  <cit> . however, to understand better the nature of the putative antiepileptogenic effect of esl there is a need to evaluate whether esl administered after latrunculin a administration also prevents the occurrence of chronic seizures. the effects of esl and its 10-hydroxy metabolite eslicarbazepine in this model fit well with the outcome of the clinical experience with esl in epilepsy also considering data from the initial proof‐of‐concept phase ii study  <cit>  as well as three subsequent phase iii studies in patients refractory to conventional aed therapy  <cit> . long-term safety and maintenance of therapeutic effect was demonstrated in one-year open-label extensions of these studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here demonstrate anticonvulsant effects of esl on the development of latrunculin a-induced seizures and paroxysmal eeg activity. esl may also exhibit disease-modifying effects beyond suppressing just seizure activity, possibly by altering the development of a hyperexcitable network, as evidenced by the suppressed changes in glycine, taurine, glutamate and aspartate concentrations associated with an antiepileptogenic effect.
