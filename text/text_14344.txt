BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer evolves through a progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that are influenced by the environment and host immunity. the interplay of molecular alterations forms biological interaction networks in colorectal cancer  <cit> . for example, epigenetic changes are known to be associated with genetic changes, as exemplified by the well-established link between mlh <dig> promoter hypermethylation and microsatellite instability   <cit> . additionally, micrornas including mir <dig> and mir <dig> are reported to regulate gene expression , resulting in abnormal loss and overexpression of proteins  <cit> . in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-host interactions manifest as lymphocytic reactions directed at the tumor  <cit> . given this multitude of molecular interactions, it is challenging to comprehensively understand the perturbations of the complex biological system and identify the key, underlying molecular events that drive colorectal carcinogenesis. network analysis is recognized as an emerging approach to evaluating multidimensional tumor molecular data with the aim of revealing critical molecular events and pathways  <cit> .

numerous lines of evidence indicate differences between proximal colon cancer, and distal colon and rectal cancer . when compared with distal colon and rectal cancer, proximal colon cancer exhibits a higher prevalence of microsatellite instability  and high-level cpg island methylator phenotype   <cit> . the proximal colon and distal colorectum have different embryologic origins; the former is derived from the midgut with blood supply from superior mesenteric artery, while the latter is derived from the hindgut with inferior mesenteric artery. moreover, epithelial cells in the proximal colon are exposed to different bowel contents, including microbiota, compared with the distal colon and rectum  <cit> . based on these differences in molecular alterations and tumor-host interactions with the microenvironment, the underlying etiology may differ between proximal and distal colorectal cancer. accordingly, the structure of the biomarker correlation network may differ by tumor location. a better understanding of the connectivity and correlation of molecular events in biomarker networks can provide new insights into colorectal cancer etiology and pathogenesis, potentially advancing prevention and treatment strategies. in cancer biological networks, highly connected molecular markers, called hubs, play essential roles in carcinogenesis  <cit> . we hypothesized that correlation network structures and hub biomarkers might differ between proximal and distal colorectal cancer. utilizing colorectal cancer databases of the nurses’ health study  and the health professionals follow-up study , we examined the status of key driver mutations, msi, cimp, expression of selected proteins in tumor cells, and immune reactions to colorectal cancer.

in the correlation network analysis, a node represented a tumor tissue biomarker, and an edge was defined as a correlation between two nodes based on spearman correlation analysis. compared with the distal colorectal cancer network, the proximal colon cancer network had more edges and greater median degree . nodes in the proximal colon cancer network tended to have a higher degree than those in the distal colorectal cancer network . the median degree value was  <dig>  in the proximal colon cancer network and  <dig>  in the distal colorectal cancer network. the total number of edges was significantly greater in the proximal colon cancer network  than in the distal colorectal cancer network  in a permutation test where tumor location variable was permuted among  <dig> patients . also, we observed significant difference in the total number of edges in another permutation test where values of each biomarker were permuted within proximal colon cancer patients and distal colorectal cancer patients separately . in addition, the value of the average clustering coefficient indicated that the nodes in the proximal colon cancer network tended to cluster together more than those in the distal colorectal cancer network . we defined hubs as nodes with a high degree centrality  based on the overall colorectal cancer network that pooled both proximal colon and distal colorectal cancer. nodes with degree centrality greater than the 80th percentile were considered as hubs. we found hubs in the proximal colon cancer network, including msi and mlh <dig> methylation, but not in the distal colorectal cancer network . for these biomarkers, degree centrality was computed as the fraction of nodes to which a node was connected. the values of degree centrality in the proximal colon cancer network and the distal colorectal cancer network were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for msi,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mlh <dig> methylation. within the distal colorectal cancer network, most of the nodes have a small number of connections. methylation-related markers tended to have high degree centrality, although these markers were not hubs. the degree centrality values were  <dig>  for mlh <dig> methylation,  <dig>  for methylations in cacna1g, neurog <dig>  runx <dig>  and socs1and  <dig>  for braf mutation, and  <dig>  for til.table  <dig> network characteristics by tumor location

to identify biomarkers that had higher connectivity particularly in the proximal colon cancer network compared with the distal colorectal cancer network, we calculated cook’s distance  for each highly-connected marker  . in table  <dig>  msi showed the largest cook’s distance  and was highly connected with other markers in the proximal colon cancer network , but not in the distal colorectal cancer network . in the proximal colon cancer network, msi was positively correlated with mlh <dig> methylation , cacna1g methylation , runx <dig> methylation , socs <dig> methylation , igf <dig> methylation , crabp <dig> methylation , braf mutation , til , neurog <dig> methylation , crohn’s-like reaction , cdkn2a methylation , abundance of fusobacterium nucleatum , sirt <dig> overexpression , loss of cdx <dig> expression , ccnd <dig> overexpression , line- <dig> methylation , peritumoral lymphocytic reaction , mir <dig> expression , and intratumoral periglandular reaction . msi was negatively correlated with kras mutation  and loss of cdkn1a expression , suggesting that these molecular events tended to be mutually exclusive with msi-high. in the distal colorectal cancer network, msi was also positively correlated with mlh <dig> methylation , til , runx <dig> methylation , crohn’s-like reaction , cacna1g methylation , socs <dig> methylation , intratumoral periglandular reaction , braf mutation , and peritumoral lymphocytic reaction . these were the subset of biomarkers positively correlated with msi in the proximal colon cancer network, implying a partly shared mechanism by which msi promotes perturbation of cellular and molecular functions. moreover, the methylation markers of mlh <dig>  igf <dig>  and cacna1g had a higher degree in the proximal colon cancer network compared with the distal colorectal cancer network. as shown in fig.  <dig>  negative correlations were observed between kras mutation and other biomarkers in the proximal colon cancer network, but not in the distal colorectal cancer network. in the proximal colon cancer network, kras mutation was negatively correlated with braf mutation , mlh <dig> methylation , msi-high , runx <dig> methylation , cacna1g methylation , crabp <dig> methylation , igf <dig> methylation , loss of cdx <dig> expression , socs <dig> methylation , cdkn2a methylation , neurog <dig> methylation , and crohn’s-like reaction .table  <dig> markers with differential connectivity by tumor location based on cook’s distance among highly-connected markersa

biomarker networks constructed in non-msi-high colorectal cancer
the higher frequency of msi-high in the proximal colon cancer network compared with the distal colorectal cancer network could potentially result in the higher connectivity of the former. therefore, as a secondary analysis, we restricted our analysis to patients with non-msi-high cancer, and constructed networks by tumor location. after matching by age and sex, there were  <dig> patients with non-msi-high proximal colon cancer and  <dig> patients with non-msi-high distal colorectal cancer . compared with the distal colorectal cancer network, we observed a slightly higher connectivity and more hubs in the proximal colon cancer network. the total numbers of edges was  <dig> in the proximal colon cancer network and  <dig> in the distal colorectal cancer network . highly connected biomarkers  were braf mutation  and methylation-related markers including cdkn2a , igf <dig> , runx <dig> , cacna1g , crabp <dig> , and neurog <dig>  in the proximal colon cancer network. in the distal colorectal cancer network, two biomarkers were hubs including neurog <dig> methylation  and runx <dig> methylation . among non-msi-high cases, braf mutation was the most distinct marker that was strongly correlated with other markers in the proximal cancer network , but not in the distal cancer network  . in the proximal colon cancer network, kras mutation tended to be mutually exclusive only with braf mutation, indicating that the observed negative correlations of kras mutation with methylation-related markers and other biomarkers might be confounded by msi-high in our earlier analysis.

biomarker networks with equal edge counts
to examine whether the difference in the number of edges across the two networks affected hub identification , we modified each network by retaining  <dig> of the largest spearman correlation coefficients in absolute values regardless of their p-values, resulting in two networks with  <dig> edges . the median degree was  <dig>  in the proximal colon cancer network and  <dig>  in the distal colorectal cancer network, indicating that edges were confined to particular biomarkers in the proximal colon cancer network. when defined as markers with degree centrality at or above the 80th percentile in the colorectal cancer network, there were  <dig> hubs including methylation-related markers, msi, braf mutation, and til in the proximal colon cancer network . in contrast, only three methylation-related markers were identified as hubs in the distal colorectal cancer network. this finding supports the characteristics of the proximal colon cancer network observed in the original network analysis, where msi and methylation-related markers were associated with perturbation of other molecular events.

sensitivity analyses
across different significance levels in the spearman correlation analyses, the total number of edges in the proximal colon cancer network was consistently greater than in the distal colorectal cancer network, supporting a more highly correlated biomarker network in proximal colon cancer . in addition, we constructed biomarker networks based on the spearman correlation analyses using binary variables for all markers and still found that the proximal colon cancer network was denser than the distal colorectal cancer network . moreover, the proximal colon cancer remained denser when the analysis included only biomarkers with missing data in less than 20% of the patients .fig.  <dig> total number of edges in biomarker networks as a function of the significance levels in spearman correlation analyses




discussion
within a tumor molecular dataset including major mutational events, msi, epigenetic features, protein expression status, and host immune reactions in  <dig> colorectal cancer patients, we conducted a network analysis to evaluate biomarker network structure in proximal colon cancer and distal colorectal cancer. we found that in proximal colon cancer there were many highly correlated biomarkers, leading to an overall denser network as compared with distal colorectal cancer. in the distal colorectal cancer network, biomarkers had fewer connections and were less clustered, resulting in fewer hubs. this finding indicates that carcinogenic events in distal colorectal cancer tended to occur independently from each other. in the proximal colon cancer network, msi was a hub and had differential connectivity with other biomarkers compared with the distal colorectal cancer network. in both the proximal colon and distal colorectal cancer networks, we observed common biomarkers that positively correlated with msi including methylation-related markers, braf mutation, and immune reactions, while overexpression or loss of protein expression associated with msi were further found only in the proximal colon cancer network. in addition to msi, cpg island methylation in mlh <dig>  igf <dig>  and cacna1g genes were highly connected to other biomarkers mainly in proximal colon cancer. among non-msi-high patients, braf mutation status was the most distinct marker that was strongly associated with other molecular events in the proximal colon cancer network, but not in the distal colorectal cancer network. the sensitivity analyses consistently showed a denser network in proximal colon cancer when compared with the distal colorectal cancer network. our results indicate that many molecular events occur in relation to msi in proximal colon cancer, and that msi and braf mutation played important roles in the carcinogenic process of proximal colon cancer.

in colorectal cancer and other types of cancer, previous biomarker network studies have shown the importance of interdependence of mutation, methylation, and protein expression  <cit> . in a biological network, hubs  are considered to be drivers playing an essential role during tumorigenesis  <cit> . previous studies showed that mlh <dig> promoter methylation causes mismatch repair deficiency and msi  <cit> . in sporadic cancer, it is not well known whether msi causes mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, and aberrant protein expressions. earlier studies reported that genomic instability conferred by somatic mutational alterations further generates mutations in oncogenes or anti-oncogenes  <cit> . our results suggest that the role of msi differ by tumor anatomic location; in proximal colon cancer, msi might lead to perturbations of many molecular events, and in distal colorectal cancer molecular events are more likely independent from msi. consistent with our findings, msi and cimp-high were highly correlated and occurred more frequently in proximal colon cancer than in distal colorectal cancer  <cit> . methylation signatures measured in our study were cimp-specific markers which were correlated with each other. thus, higher frequencies of msi and cimp-high might contribute to the higher connectivity of the proximal colon cancer network. however, even when we excluded msi cancer patients from the analyses, the higher connectivity persisted in the proximal colon cancer network. in addition, when we modified the two networks such that each had  <dig> edges, corresponding to the  <dig> most positive or negative correlation coefficients, the proximal colon cancer network remained to have more hubs and greater median degree than the distal colorectal cancer network. our findings provide new insights into the carcinogenesis of proximal colon cancer, which possibly exhibits highly interactive biological mechanisms.


braf oncogenic mutations are observed in 10% to 20% of colorectal cancer patients and are associated with msi-high and cimp-high phenotypes  <cit> . the serine/threonine-protein kinase braf is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway, which is associated with proliferation, cell growth, and differentiation  <cit> . in our study, cimp-high was associated with braf mutation in both proximal colon and distal colorectal cancer. previous studies observed cimp-high and braf mutations in an early-stage colorectal neoplasm, and acquisition of braf mutation was considered to be mediated by dna hypermethylation of several genes, including igfbp <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> . the close relationship between cimp and braf mutation may drive carcinogenesis regardless of tumor location.

a large body of literature demonstrated that colorectal cancer patients with non-msi-high and mutant braf were associated with the highest mortality, whereas patients with msi-high/braf-wild-type showed the lowest mortality when both msi and braf mutation status were considered . among proximal colon cancer patients, the non-msi-high/braf-mutant subtype was associated with a worse prognosis  <cit> . together with these previous studies, our findings suggest the critical role of braf mutation in the absence of msi-high especially in the proximal colon carcinogenesis.

our results showed the strong negative correlation between braf and kras mutations specifically in proximal colon cancer. both braf and kras oncogenes encode proteins involved in the mapk pathway, and braf mutation has been reported to be mutually exclusive with kras mutation in colorectal cancer  <cit> . braf is more frequently mutated in the proximal colon than distal colorectum, while the frequency of kras mutation is more similar throughout the colorectum except for the cecum  <cit> . the biological correlation pattern between braf and kras might depend on tumor location.

the distal colorectal cancer network was less densely connected than the proximal colon cancer network. although we did not find biomarkers with high degree centrality, the promoter methylations, braf mutation, and til tended to be correlated with other molecular events. distal carcinoma was previously reported to be more responsive to drug regimens, including 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapeutics and single-agent anti-epidermal growth factor receptor  antibodies, while proximal carcinoma tended to show more resistance to those treatments  <cit> . our results from the network analysis found that oncogenic processes are relatively independent from one another in distal colorectal cancer. taken together, our data support a biological difference between colorectal carcinoma by tumor location.

we recognize that there are several limitations to our study. although we chose widely recognized pathological biomarkers in colorectal cancer, our data did not cover all molecular pathological markers that have been reported in the literature, such as the mutation status of smad <dig> and pten  <cit> . our selection of the biomarkers might have resulted in a greater connectivity of the biomarker network in the proximal colon. measurement errors could have existed in protein expression analyses using immunohistochemistry . nonetheless, based on reviews by two independent pathologists, most of the ihc markers showed agreement levels generally considered to be reasonable in pathology research . we conducted network analyses focusing on the proximal colon and distal colorectum, but not on more detailed segments . the importance of examining these segments warrants further investigations with even larger sample sizes. these results contribute to our understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis, suggesting a different mechanism by tumor location. although our findings were corroborated by sensitivity analyses, future validation studies with independent data sets are necessary to confirm these findings.

despite the limitations, our study has several strengths that distinguish it from previous studies. first, we measured different kinds of tumor biomarkers including somatic mutations, methylation levels, msi status, immune reactions, and protein expressions. these measurements provided a reasonably comprehensive view of molecular interplay in the networks and enabled the identification of important carcinogenic pathways. second, our overall sample size with  <dig> cases enabled us to conduct robust network analyses using multiple biomarkers. third, we collected colorectal tumors from hospitals and pathology laboratories across the u.s. , which increases generalizability of our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
biomarkers in proximal colon cancer possessed higher connectivity while those in distal colorectal cancer tended to be independent from each other. in proximal colon cancer, msi-high and braf mutation occurred in relation to many other tumor features, indicating their important roles during carcinogenesis. our findings highlight the necessity of a systems therapeutic approach that can target both specific and multiple pathways of the proximal colon cancer network.
