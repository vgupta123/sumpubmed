BACKGROUND
the genomic dna of eukaryotes forms chromatin structures with several proteins. chromatin is composed of nucleosome cores in which 146- <dig> base pairs  of dna are wrapped in  <dig>  turns around a histone octamer containing two copies each of four core histones: h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  <cit> . another histone  binds to about  <dig> bp of dna in the linker region flanking the nucleosome core  <cit> . nucleosomes are involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, because chromatin can limit the accessibility of regulatory sites. for example, it has been reported in several organisms that the nucleosome occupancy rate upstream from transcription start sites  is lower than that in other regions  <cit> . therefore, understanding the mechanism of nucleosome positioning is important for the analysis of transcriptional regulation and promoter functions.

it is known that nucleosome positioning can be affected by dna sequence. many previous studies have identified various motifs for nucleosome positioning or inhibition with in vivo and in vitro experiments  <cit> . it is also known that 10-bp periodic aa/tt or gc dinucleotides are strongly associated with nucleosome positioning in the genomes of several species and in synthetic dnas  <cit> . short oligonucleotides occurring at intervals of about  <dig> bp are associated with the positions of the major grooves or minor grooves facing the histone surface and with the bendability of dna during nucleosome formation  <cit> . using these dependencies, some researchers recently succeeded, more or less, in the computational prediction of nucleosome positions in the genome sequences of several yeasts  <cit> . in particular, segal et al. explained about 50% of in vivo nucleosome positions using a position weight matrix of center-aligned mononucleosome dna in budding yeast and chicken  <cit> . the 10-bp periodicity has been observed by fourier analysis in the genome of nematode, plant, insect and fungus  <cit> .

in recent years, high-throughput sequencing techniques and tiling array experiments have provided an avalanche of nucleosomal dna location information in the human  <cit> , fly  <cit> , nematode  <cit> , and budding yeast genomes  <cit> . schones et al. demonstrated nucleosomal reorganization during the activation of human t cells using a large number of nucleosomal dnas, which were massively sequenced with a new-generation sequencer. lee et al. and shivaswamy et al. showed that about 70%-80% of the whole genome of budding yeast is occupied by nucleosomes. these large-scale experiments make it possible to analyze the sequence dependencies of global nucleosomal positioning across a wide range of organisms.

in this study, we first asked whether the reported periodic motifs can widely affect in vivo nucleosome locations through the whole genomes of all eukaryotes. using fourier analysis, the spectrum of primate genomes does not exhibit clear peaks with a 10-bp periodicity: strong and wide 84-bp and 167-bp periodicities are observed, instead. these periodicities, which may be associated with the length of dna wrapping core histones and the linker histone, mainly originate from alu repetitive elements, as their strength decreased markedly in alu-masked genomes.

the alu family are primate-specific short interspersed elements , and constitute the most prevalent repetitive element in the human genome  <cit> . alu elements are categorized into two groups: monomers and dimers. a typical dimeric alu is about  <dig> bp long, and is composed of two distinct gc- and cpg-rich monomers flanking an a-rich region and a poly tract. monomeric alu elements consist of two classes: free left alu monomers  and free right alu monomers , corresponding to each monomer in a dimer. the left monomer is slightly shorter than the right one  <cit> . although a few alu elements in promoters are reported to affect their downstream gene expression  <cit> , most of them are silent in cells. thus, specific positioning of nucleosomes on alu elements may be important in masking unnecessary effects of alu's to nearby genes. dnase i nicking analyses have demonstrated that several dimeric alu elements have some affinity to core histones  <cit> . according to these studies, two nucleosomes are formed in both sides of the central a-tract of alu elements.

using large-scale nucleosome mapping data, we observed that such specific positioning occurs globally in the entire genome. we further showed that nucleosomes are also arranged in nucleosomal repeat lengths  around them. our discoveries should be useful in the prediction of nucleosomal positions in primates and the analysis of transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
genome-wide nucleotide periodicity
we analyzed the genome-wide nucleotide periodicity in  <dig> different species  under the assumption that if the 10-bp periodic nucleotides are the main factor determining nucleosome positioning, peaks of this periodicity should also be observed in the whole genome. the strength of the periodicity was calculated for  <dig> kinds of mono- and di-nucleotide steps using fourier analysis  <cit> .

in consistent with a previous study  <cit> , clear spikes with a periodicity of about  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp were observed in fishes, chordates, an insect, a nematode, plants, and a fungus with the aa/tt dinucleotide step . in the nematode genome, another small peak with a periodicity of about  <dig> bp was observed . the spectra of these organisms calculated with other nucleotide steps also showed clear peaks of about 9-bp, 10-bp, or 11-bp periodicity. in the chicken genome, weak peaks of 10-bp periodicity were observed only for the a/t and g/c steps. however, no clear peaks with these periodicities were observed in mammals. in contrast, two large and wide peaks centered at about  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were observed in the human, chimpanzee, and rhesus genomes. these primate-specific peaks were clearly observed in the aa/tt, a/t and g/c steps, and were especially remarkable in the aa/tt step . the value of  <dig> bp corresponds approximately to the sum of the length of a nucleosome core  and the length of the linker-histone-binding region , and  <dig> bp corresponds to about half this length. this observation suggests that these periodicities are related to nucleosome positioning in primate genomes.

because it is known that some repetitive elements are detectable by nucleotide periodicities  <cit> , we next analyzed the genome-wide periodicity while masking all alu elements, which are primate-specific sines detected by repeatmasker. the strengths of the 84-bp and 167-bp periodicities in the alu-masked primate genomes were remarkably lower than those in the nonmasked genomes . although weak and sharp peaks of 84-bp or 167-bp periodicity still remained in some nucleotide steps, they were possibly derived from alu elements that had not been identified by repeatmasker or from some other genome features. thus, it is clear that these 84-bp and 167-bp periodicities mainly originate from alu repetitive elements.

effects of alu elements on nucleosome positioning
to confirm the relationship between alu elements and nucleosome positioning in the human genome, we analyzed the distribution of nucleosomes within and around the alu elements. in this study, the alu family was categorized into three classes: dimer, flam, and fram. after removing incomplete alu elements, we identified  <dig>  dimers of 280- <dig> bp in length,  <dig>  flams of 110- <dig> bp, and  <dig>  frams of 150- <dig> bp . these occupy about  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the whole human genome, respectively.

we used the data of paired-end nucleosomal dna tags  from hek <dig> cells made by the micrococcal nuclease  digestion and by the sequencing with the illumina ga-ii sequencers . in total,  <dig> , <dig> paired-end nucleosome dna tags were mapped on the human genome . more than 90%  of them showed unique positions, and about  <dig> %  were assigned within the alu elements. by aligning the nucleosome signal  to the central position of each type of alu elements, we found one clear peak on the left side and another weaker peak on the right side in dimeric alu elements  as well as a single clear peak in both flams and frams . on the other hand, large troughs of the nucleosome signal were observed near the a-rich regions . in the dimeric alu elements, the signal intensity of the left peak is not so different from that of randomly extracted fragments  and the intensity of the right peak is much smaller than the normal level. these results indicate that the positions where the nucleosome structure is formed within dimeric alu elements are very limited; of the two possible slots, one is used at the normal level while the other is disfavored. on the other hand, monomeric alu elements have a single possible slot.

the  <dig>  multi-hit tags that overlap with alu elements were not included in the above result . for about a half of them , all of their multiple hits were mapped within alu elements while for 80% of them  more than 85% of their multiple hits overlapped with alu elements . then, from the above result only, there may remain some concern that the observed slots are only artifacts caused by the removal of tags mapped to multiple locations. thus, we randomly chose one from each of multi-hit tags that were mapped within the alu region and redrew the distribution of nucleosome signal around alu elements . similarly with figures 2b-d, the nucleosome distribution shows two or one slots in alu elements and lower occupancy of nucleosome is observed in the right arm of the dimeric alu's. when we repeated the same procedure using the muti-hit tags more than 85% of which overlap with alu elements, similar distributions were observed . furthermore, standard deviation of the relative distances of multiple hits from the center of nearest alu elements for each tag was only  <dig>  bp on average. overall, we concluded that the nucleosome slots in alu elements are not artifacts.

we also detected phased nucleosome positioning at approximately the nucleosome repeat length  around the alu elements   <cit> . this phased frequency extended to both orientations and became weaker as the site is more distant from alu elements. these observations suggest that alu elements contain nucleosomes in specific positions, and also influence the positioning of neighboring nucleosomes.

validation of the positioning of neighboring nucleosomes by independent data
to verify this suggestion with another independent experiment, we analyzed the distribution of nucleosome locations using the data from high-resolution tiling arrays for  <dig>  human promoters in seven different cell types  <cit> . each probe in every array was aligned by both edges of the alu elements, including both monomers and dimers, and the signals were averaged at each position for all arrays. the hybridization signals were significantly higher than the background signal at regions just upstream and downstream from alu elements . this result indicates that nucleosomes are preferentially located in the neighborhood of alu elements. this conclusion remains unchanged in the data for each cell type, except a <dig> . furthermore, in a region of about  <dig> bp immediately upstream and downstream from the alu elements, the signals were lower than the background signal. this tendency was also observed in the distribution of nucleosome centers . these results imply that the regions immediately upstream and downstream from alu elements are likely to be preferentially used as linker regions. although we analyzed the signals flanking other repetitive elements, there was little difference from the background signal , indicating that the effect on the positioning of neighboring nucleosomes is specific to alu elements.

considering these data together, it is clear that the alu family significantly affects nucleosome positioning in the human genome.

relationship between nucleosome positioning and gene expression
it has been suggested that nucleosomes are predominant in promoters of unexpressed genes  <cit> . therefore, the observed restriction of nucleosome positioning within and around alu elements may influence their promoter functions in vivo. to verify this possibility, we calculated the average expression rate from the number of precise 5'-end cdna tags mapped within alu elements. as controls, the rates for 5'-end tags mapped in regions around refseq tsss and randomly selected regions were also calculated. precise 5'-end tags for hek <dig> and mcf <dig> cells were previously detected by the oligo-capping method and were sequenced with an illumina solexa sequencer  <cit> . the average expression rates in an alu element were about  <dig>  and  <dig>  parts per million  in each cell type, respectively . in contrast, the expression rates in refseq tsss were more than  <dig> , remarkably higher than those in the alu elements, and those at random sites were also higher than those in alu elements . we further calculated the rates in the flanking regions: , , , ,  and ; - <dig> and + <dig> indicate 5' and 3' end of alu elements, respectively. the expression rates at the flanking regions are slightly higher than those in alu elements , but are significantly lower than those at random sites. these results suggest that most alu elements do not have the activity of promoter.

discussion
alu elements are distributed only in primates, and comprise about 10% of the whole human genome  <cit> . in this study, we showed that nucleosome positioning is significantly influenced within and around alu elements using large-scale nucleosome mapping data. englander et al. previously reported that dimeric alu elements have a capacity containing two nucleosomes  <cit> . these positions are consistent with the two peaks observed in figure 2b. since dnase i nicking pattern in their experiment is less clear in the right arm compared with the left arm of dimeric alu elements, the low occupancy in the right arm observed in our analysis may be caused by the lower stability of nucleosome positioning. from a massive number of nucleosomal dna sequence data, we demonstrated that neighboring nucleosomes tend to be arranged with regular intervals. nucleosome signals from the tiling array data showed some preference for nucleosome positioning just around alu elements. the a-rich sequences observed in low nucleosome density regions are known as a motif for inhibiting nucleosome formation  <cit> . from our analysis based on two independent data sets, we conclude that the lower nucleosome signals at the boundary of alu elements affect the arrangement of nucleosome positioning around them. although nucleosome depletions are often observed in the promoters of active genes, few tss tags could be mapped in alu elements and their flanking regions. it is possible that restriction of alu elements is regulated by other epigenetic factors. this hypothesis is supported by two previous reports that  <dig> % of cpg sites in alu elements are completely methylated  <cit> , and that methylation of h <dig> lysine  <dig> is enriched in alu elements  <cit> .

the genome-wide periodicity of  <dig> organisms showed differences in their sequence dependence. peaks with 10-bp periodicity were observed in organisms from budding yeast to chicken. our results are in agreement with those of segal et al., who showed that the nucleosome locations in budding yeast can be predicted with the model constructed from chicken nucleosomal dna. in some organisms, periodicities of about  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp have been found. these periodicities might be related to the minimum and maximum periods of the double helix of dna in nucleosomes because its observed value varies from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp  <cit> . furthermore, gupta et al. previously showed 3-bp periodicities of cg and gc dinucleotides are overrepresented in nucleosome-forming sequences in promoters and encode regions  <cit> . in our results, peaks of cg 3-bp periodicities are found in many species, but not in primates, suggesting that these sequence dependencies may not effect across the whole primate genomes.

it is surprising that the sequence features governing global nucleosomal positioning are quite different among organisms, even though the core histone protein families are highly conserved among species  <cit> . although it has been reported that a set of dna molecules with the highest affinity with the histone octamer in an in vitro selection assay showed a 10-bp periodicity of mono- or dinucleotide steps  <cit> , our result suggests that they may not use these features as the major mechanism of nucleosomal positioning, to allow flexibility of chromatin remodeling and complex transcription regulation. we showed that a significant part of nucleosome positioning in the primate genomes can be explained by 84-bp and 167-bp periodicities, which were previously reported in human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> by a similar method  <cit> . here, we confirmed that these periodicities are specific to primates because they are due to primate-specific alu elements.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study provides an important clue to understanding the whole chromatin composition of the human genome. we hope that our discoveries will extend our understanding of the nucleosomal organization in primate genomes, and contribute essential knowledge about the complexities of transcriptional regulation.
