BACKGROUND
the first crucial step in successfully fighting infections is the sensing of microbial products by innate immune cells, e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells  <cit> . toll-like receptors  sense microbial products and initiate a cascade of signaling events to alert the immune defense. members of the tlr family recognize a range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns produced by bacteria, protozoa, fungi, or viruses  <cit> . one of the best studied examples for a pathogen associated pattern is bacterial lipopolysaccharide . binding of lps to the tlr <dig> complex of the host activates two signaling cascades via different adaptor proteins leading to the activation of two main transcription factors: nfκb, a key transcription factor regulating pro-inflammatory genes, and interferon  regulatory factor  <dig> , which induces irf3-responsive genes, most prominently ifnβ. ifnβ and other cytokines subsequently act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to induce the expression of immune responsive genes  <cit> .

a major component of ifnα/β signaling is tyrosine kinase  <dig> , a member of the janus kinase  family  <cit> . activated jaks phosphorylate members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription  family, which mediate signals from a large number of cytokines and growth factors  <cit> . activation of jak <dig> and tyk <dig> by ifnα/β stimulation leads to a series of phosphorylation events, causing the formation of ifn stimulated gene factor  <dig>  complexes that consist of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and ifn regulatory factor  <dig> . subsequently, isgf <dig> translocates to the nucleus and binds to a specific transcription factor binding-site , the ifn stimulated response element , which in turn activates transcription of several hundred ifn-responsive genes. to a lesser extent, these signaling events also lead to the formation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> homo- and heterodimers that bind another tfbs, the ifnγ activated sequence   <cit> .

in mice, tyk <dig> is only partially required for ifnα/β signaling, where it mainly serves to amplify the immune response  <cit> . we and others have previously shown a surprisingly low susceptibility of tyk <dig> knockout mice to lps-induced endotoxin shock, despite normal production of proinflammatory cytokines  and tumor necrosis factor α   <cit> . in vitro, tyk <dig> mutant peritoneal macrophages fail to efficiently induce ifnα/β and nitric oxide  production upon lps treatment. in addition, tyk <dig> deficiency influences the basal level of several ifn-responsive genes  <cit> . however, despite the importance of tyk <dig> in mediating immune and inflammatory responses, how this jak regulates global transcription of downstream target genes remains largely unknown.

here we compare the genome-wide expression profiles of tyk <dig> mutant and wildtype mouse peritoneal macrophages with and without activation by lps using microarrays. in particular, we focus on ifn-responsive genes and their putative regulators and use bioinformatic analysis to examine how the observed changes in gene expression relate to gene ontology categories and cis-regulatory elements   <cit> . we find that tyk <dig> is essential for mediating the full lps response and for baseline expression of ifn-inducible genes, but not for the lps-induced upregulation of ifn-responsive genes. moreover, we show that lps challenge suppresses the expression of genes involved in metabolism and we establish a critical role for tyk <dig> function in this downregulation.

RESULTS
effects of tyk <dig> and lps on gene expression
to determine the effects of tyk <dig> and lps on gene expression we used codelink mouse whole genome arrays on mrna isolated from wt  and tyk2-/-  macrophages, either stimulated with lps for six hours or kept untreated. after filtering and quality control, we retained  <dig> genes for statistical and bioinformatic analysis .

at the basal level, in the absence of lps stimulation, we found that  <dig>  of  <dig> genes analyzed were differentially expressed between wt and tyk2-/- macrophages . among the genes with the largest expression differences between genotypes, many are known to be involved in immune function. the majority of these genes was downregulated in tyk2-/- relative to wt cells, including for example ifnγ- inducible protein  <dig> , ifn regulatory factor  <dig> , and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like genes  <dig> and  <dig> , as well as three out of five  ifn-responsive genes shown in figure  <dig> 

consistent with this, gene ontology  analysis showed that gene classes involved in immunity were significantly downregulated in tyk2-/- relative to wt cells . interestingly, genes belonging to metabolic gene classes showed higher expression in wt relative to tyk2-/-, including genes in the classes "metabolism", "lipid biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", and "cholesterol biosynthesis" . overall, we observed a small but significant shift in gene expression towards lower values in tyk2-/- cells, suggesting the involvement of the majority of metabolic genes in this shift . this relatively small but consistent effect can also be seen at the level of individual genes, for example for the lipid genes shown in figure  <dig>  thus, in macrophages, tyk <dig> is not only required for basal expression of immune genes but also for the maintenance of metabolic genes at a low level of expression in an uninduced state.

within the "biological process" annotation, gene classes  were separately contrasted with all other classes using t-tests on standardized coefficients.  basal differences between genotypes,  lps induction in wt, and  differences between genotypes in lps induction . er, approximate mean expression ratio, nc, mean normed coefficients.

in contrast to the relatively small number of differences in baseline expression between wt and mutant cells, lps treatment changed the transcriptional status of wt macrophages dramatically:  <dig> genes  were either up- or downregulated upon exposure to lps, including many genes involved in immunity . this massive change in transcriptional status is also reflected in the large distance between the observed curve and the curve showing the theoretical expectation in figure 1b. among the genes upregulated by lps, several are known to also be induced by cytokines, chemokines, or cellular stressors, including the interleukins il1a, il1b, il12a, the ifn stimulated gene isg <dig>  and tnfα, as well as all five ifn-responsive genes shown in figure  <dig>  in contrast, genes involved in lipid metabolism were typically downregulated in wt cells . similar to the situation at the basal level, this downward shift in expression involved almost all genes .

in total, lps treatment influenced  <dig> go classes, with strong upregulation of genes involved in inflammatory responses and chemotaxis and downregulation of genes involved in metabolism, indicating a negative relationship between immune response and metabolism . in tyk <dig> mutant cells, however, only  <dig> genes  were influenced by lps, suggesting that tyk2-/- cells respond overall much less to lps than wt cells .

the observation that tyk2-/- macrophages might exhibit an impaired lps response was confirmed when we analyzed differences in how genotypes react to lps challenge:  <dig> genes  showed a difference in lps induction between wt and tyk <dig> mutant . for example, among the differentially induced immune genes, lps caused a much weaker induction of the interferon-stimulated protein isg <dig> and the no synthase nos <dig> in tyk2-/- than in wt cells, but a stronger induction of ifi <dig> and irf <dig> relative to wt .

overall, we found that eleven classes of genes were differentially induced by lps between genotypes, including weaker upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and negative cell cycle control and weaker suppression of metabolic gene expression in tyk2-/- relative to wt cells . again, we found that this downward shift in gene expression involved the majority of all genes . most notably, genes involved in "cholesterol biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", "steroid biosynthesis", and "lipid biosynthesis" were much less strongly suppressed upon lps challenge in tyk2-/- than in wt macrophages. metabolic genes were therefore downregulated by lps in wt cells, but their expression levels remained closer to the basal, uninduced state in tyk2-/- macrophages. rt-qpcr broadly confirmed the effects of tyk <dig> on immune and metabolic genes . thus, tyk <dig> is required for lps-induced upregulation of immune and other genes and for the suppression of metabolic genes upon lps challenge .

transcription factor binding-sites
the expression of the about  <dig>  genes in mammalian genomes is regulated by many fewer transcription and other regulatory factors. we therefore related our microarray expression data to information on tfbss upstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . since tfbss are often short and relatively uninformative, and because many putative tfbss are biologically irrelevant, we extracted sequences from the 5' upstream region  that are conserved between human and mouse, as such phylogenetic conservation might indicate functional importance in transcriptional control. this bioinformatics analysis identified  <dig> classes of putative 5'ur tfbss.

at the basal level, only genes that contain the irf/isre tfbs were differentially regulated between genotypes; genes with gas elements showed no significant difference between genotypes . since the irf/isre element is responsive to the isgf <dig> complex, genes containing such an element are likely candidate targets of ifnα/β signaling. tyk2-/- macrophages had on average an approximately  <dig>  times reduced expression of genes with an irf/isre tfbs as compared to wt cells . unlike the situation for metabolic genes, this difference between genotypes was not caused by the majority of genes, but by a few genes with much higher expression in wt than in tyk2-/- . moreover, the expression of several immune genes, including z-dna binding protein  <dig> , guanylate binding protein  <dig> , ifn-induced transmembrane protein  <dig> , and the interleukin  <dig> receptor α , was about three times higher in wt than in tyk2-/- cells .

we assigned genes to  <dig> classes of putative tfbss, either identified by their name, the major transcription factor binding to them, or their number in xie et al.  <cit> . the table shows the number of genes in each tfbs class, approximate mean expression ratios , mean normed coefficients , and p-values from t-tests.  basal differences between genotypes,  lps induction in wt, and  differences between genotypes in lps induction .

lps treatment influenced seven classes of genes in wt macrophages , with two of them containing putative binding-sites for unknown transcription factors. similar to the baseline differences in expression between genotypes, genes with the irf/isre tfbs , cluster of differentiation  <dig> , and il15ra) were strongly upregulated after six hours of lps treatment. these genes were followed by an uncharacterized class of genes, either with chx <dig> tfbs , the 14-3- <dig> gene stratifin, the myc associated factor x , and cd38) or containing homeodomain transcription factor ipf1/pdx <dig> motifs . to our knowledge, neither chx <dig> tfbs nor ipf1/pdx <dig> motifs have previously been implicated in the lps response. genes containing a tata box were also significantly upregulated upon lps exposure . furthermore, we found evidence for weak upregulation of genes with conserved nf-at motifs , with ap-1/jun and c-rel consensus sequences , and with nfκb motifs . interestingly, we failed to observe lps-induced downregulation of any gene class .

six classes of genes differed in their induction by lps between genotypes, and for all these classes induction by lps was lower in tyk2-/- than in wt cells . genes containing the pituitary-specific transcription factor pou1f <dig> motif showed the most pronounced differences in mean expression, whereas genes with a ipf1/pdx <dig> motif  or a tata box  showed the highest statistical significance . however, despite these genotypic differences in inducibility, lps induced on average similar expression of genes with an irf/isre tfbs in wt and tyk2-/- macrophages . upon lps challenge, wt and tyk2-/- cells therefore reached qualitatively and quantitatively similar expression levels of genes that contain the irf/isre tfbs. these results suggest that tyk <dig> is functionally required for the baseline expression of genes with an irf/isre tfbs, but dispensable for their lps-induced upregulation.

since the above analysis of irf/isre tfbss was based on very stringent criteria and thus likely to miss many known ifn-inducible genes , we also produced a list of  <dig> ifn-responsive genes from the literature and asked how many of those genes showed expression changes in our microarray experiment and contain irf/isre or gas tfbss.

after filtering of lowly expressed genes,  <dig> genes remained in the analysis. at the basal level, we found that this class of ifn-inducible genes was on average downregulated relative to all other genes in tyk2-/- versus wt macrophages . while the mean expression ratios relative to wt were quite small, the average difference was caused by a few genes of large effect, with  <dig> genes being significantly differentially expressed . the genes that showed the largest expression differentials were irf <dig>  ifn-inducible proteins  <dig> and  <dig> , and transporter associated with ag processing  <dig> , thereby confirming that tyk <dig> is required for baseline expression of ifn-inducible genes. upon lps stimulation, ifn-inducible genes were on average much more strongly upregulated than other genes . again, this pattern was mainly caused by a few genes with extreme effects, including il1b, chemokine  ligands  <dig> and  <dig> , and chemokine  ligand  <dig> . as in our analysis of genes with the irf/isre tfbs, the average induction of ifn-inducible genes by lps was similar between tyk2-/- and wt macrophages, with both cell types reaching qualitatively identical expression levels . to validate these microarray results we performed rt-qpcr on nine ifn-inducible genes and found a good agreement with respect to approximate fold induction .

ifn-responsive genes contained significantly more irf/isre and gas tfbss than other genes, although enrichment was only modest for the latter. the criteria of inclusion, i.e. the length of the 5'ur and the counting of only tfbss conserved between human and mouse influenced the results considerably. as expected, conservation of tfbss among species decreased the number of false positives, whereas a long 5'ur stretch or no conservation increased it .

3' utr regulatory elements
as mrna levels are not only known to be regulated by 5'ur tfbss, but also post-transcriptionally by regulatory elements in the 3'untranslated region , we were interested in relating the observed expression differences to putative 3'utr regulatory sequences. we focused on two not mutually exclusive classes of regulatory sequences:  conserved 3'utr motifs and  3'utr microrna  cognate sequences.

to examine motifs in the 3'utr we analyzed our data with respect to  <dig> classes of conserved putative 3'utr regulatory sequences defined by xie et al.  <cit>  . as compared to 5'ur tfbss, we found many more gene classes to be differentially expressed . this might simply be due to a larger number of genes containing specific 3'utr motifs than 5'ur tfbss. alternatively, 3'utr elements might be more conserved, or easier to detect, than 5'ur tfbss. we observed four classes of motifs that were differentially regulated between genotypes at the basal level ,  <dig> that were up- or downregulated after lps treatment in wt , and three that showed differences in lps inducibility between genotypes . genes with au-rich elements  were the most significantly upregulated upon lps treatment . similar to what we observed for ifn-responsive genes or those with irf/isre tfbss, this pattern was mainly caused by a few genes with extreme effects on expression, such as il1a, il1b, cxcl <dig>  and tnfα, which were among the most responsive genes . in contrast, lps caused downregulation of a large class of genes containing poly-a signal  motifs . however, genes with m2/are or m1/poly-a motifs neither differed in baseline expression, nor in lps inducibility between wt and tyk2-/- macrophages.

a total of  <dig> 3'utr motis were identified as described in xie et al.  <cit> . the table shows the number of genes in each class of motif, approximate mean expression ratios , mean normed coefficients , and p-values from t-tests.  basal differences between genotypes,  lps induction in wt, and  differences between genotypes in lps induction .

a special class of 3'utr regulatory elements important in the regulation of gene expression are the targets of mirnas, short single-stranded rna molecules consisting of 21- <dig> nucleotides. to analyze mirna cognate motifs we related known mirnas from mirbase http://www.mirbase.org/ <cit>  to the octameric sequences in  <cit> . using this approach, we were able to uniquely define different cognate 3'utr sequences . out of  <dig> such sequences, we found three mirna cognate motif classes to be differentially expressed at the basal level, three classes to be influenced by lps in wt cells, and three classes to differ in their lps inducibility between genotypes . as far as we know, none of these mirna motifs has been previously implicated in the ifn or lps response. however, since conserved 3'utr elements and mirna consensus sites are still poorly characterized, it is difficult to functionally interpret these results. nonetheless, our observations provide strong evidence for an involvement of such regulatory sequences in the lps response of wt and tyk2-/- macrophages.

discussion
in this microarray study we have investigated the role of the jak protein kinase family member tyk <dig> in basal and lps-induced gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. while several previous studies have demonstrated that tyk <dig> is an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses  <cit> , here we show how tyk <dig> globally affects genome-wide transcript levels.

at the basal uninduced level, we found subtle but significant differences in gene expression between wt and tyk2-/- macrophages. relative to wt, tyk2-deficient macrophages displayed reduced expression of many immune genes, in particular some genes that contain ifn response elements  in their 5'ur, suggesting that tyk <dig> deficiency compromises the type i ifn  response. this observation confirms previous findings demonstrating that ifnα/β signaling is reduced in tyk2-/- mice and that ifnα <dig> and ifnβ mrna levels are diminished in tyk <dig> null macrophages at the basal level  <cit> .

in addition to the isgf <dig> complex, type i ifns also activate stat <dig> homodimers, which induce gene expression via ifnγ activated sequence  elements. furthermore, stat <dig> homodimers are strongly activated by ifnγ, whose production and signaling is partially impaired in the absence of tyk <dig>  <cit> . it is still controversial whether macrophages can produce significant amounts of biologically active ifnγ  <cit> , however, cells might have been exposed to ifnγ during the generation procedure. we were therefore interested to determine if genes containing gas tfbss are also influenced by the absence of tyk <dig>  in contrast to the involvement of irf/isre tfbs in the tyk <dig> mediated response, we failed to find evidence for differential expression of genes containing gas elements. since the mouse genome contains very many such elements, not all of which are involved in gene regulation, it is possible that our bioinformatic analysis failed to find those gas elements that are biologically relevant. thus, while in our study reduced baseline expression of immunity related and ifn-responsive genes in tyk2-deficient macrophages seems to be mainly mediated by irf/isre tfbss, the role of tyk <dig> in gas-driven gene regulation deserves further investigation.

we also found that tyk <dig> is required for the full response of genes upon lps challenge, as expected based on previous experiments  <cit> . lps challenge affected the expression of about 48% of all genes in wt cells, including many immune genes, but influenced only about 30% of all genes in tyk2-/- cells. consequently, tyk2-deficient macrophages failed to induce many lps-responsive transcripts, in particular immunity related genes. surprisingly, however, ifn-responsive genes did not follow this trend: lps challenge increased the expression of ifn-inducible genes to a similar extent in wt and tyk2-/- macrophages, suggesting that tyk <dig> might not be critical for lps-induced upregulation of ifn-responsive genes. thus, although previous observations have found reduced levels of ifnα <dig> and ifnβ in tyk2-/- macrophages  <cit> , a high proportion of lps-induced type i ifn signaling might be largely independent of tyk <dig> 

several previous studies have examined ifn mediated immune and inflammatory transcription in bone marrow derived mouse macrophages  using microarrays  <cit> . thomas et al.  <cit>  studied wt and ifnβ-/- cells at the basal level and after one and three hours of lps treatment using affymetrix microarrays. many genes whose baseline levels were reduced by lack of ifnβ also had significantly lower levels in tyk2-/- cells in our experiment. the overall correlation between expression differences for ifnβ-/- vs. wt  <cit>  and tyk2-/- vs. wt  was r =  <dig>  . hence, the effect of ifnβ deficiency on baseline gene expression is similar to the lack of tyk <dig>  thomas et al.  <cit>  also identified many lps-induced genes in wt that we found to be induced in our study . however, while ifnβ-/- macrophages showed an impaired lps response for many ifn dependent genes  <cit> , induction of these genes by lps was generally unimpaired in tyk2-/- macrophages in our experiment. a comparison of lps inducibility between ifnβ-/- and tyk2-/- macrophages only revealed a weak correlation of r =  <dig>  . tyk <dig> therefore seems to be required for basal expression of ifnβ target genes but not for their induction by lps. in another microarray study by fleetwood et al.  <cit> , genes whose basal expression levels depend on intact type i ifn signaling were characterized in bmdms, either cultivated in the presence of macrophage colony stimulating factor  or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor . most genes that were downregulated in ifnar1-/- genotypes in both m-csf and gm-csf bmdms were also decreased in tyk2-/- relative to wt cells in our experiment , thus confirming our observation that tyk <dig> is involved in basal ifnα/β signaling. furthermore, the effects of basal type i ifn signaling on gene expression in the thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages used in our study were similar to those observed in the bmdms used in  <cit>  and  <cit> .

interestingly, our study also provides evidence for a previously unknown role of tyk <dig> in regulating metabolism. tyk <dig> mutant macrophages showed enhanced baseline expression of metabolic genes relative to wt cells, including genes involved in steroid, sterol, and lipid metabolism. upon lps treatment, metabolic gene expression was strongly decreased in wt macrophages, while in tyk2-/- macrophages expression of these genes remained relatively unchanged. thus, the differential lps response of wt versus mutant macrophages increased differences in gene expression already present at the basal level: the relatively low expression of metabolic genes in wt cells was strongly suppressed by lps, whereas in tyk2-/- cells lps suppressed the relatively high expression of metabolic genes much less. this effect pertained to most genes in the go class "metabolism", and in particular to genes belonging to the classes "cholesterol biosynthesis", "sterol biosynthesis", "steroid biosynthesis", and "fatty acid metabolism" taken together, these results suggest an involvement of tyk <dig> in the regulation of general metabolism and of lipid metabolism in particular. tyk <dig> might thus be an important mediator of the connection between immunity and metabolism.

two not mutually exclusive mechanisms might account for the effects of tyk <dig> on metabolic gene expression. on the one hand, tyk2/ifn signaling might directly lead to decreased metabolism, possibly because upregulation of immune function shuts down other energetically demanding processes  <cit> . on the other hand, tyk <dig> might exhibit pleiotropic effects on immunity and metabolism that are largely independent: a canonical ifn signaling function of tyk <dig> might be associated with an independent role in metabolic regulation. potentially consistent with either model, we observed that lps treatment of macrophages reduces the expression of mitochondrial genes and that this downregulation is impaired in tyk2-/- cells relative to wt . remarkably, dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration has been shown for tyk2-deficient pro-b cells  <cit> . in a similar vein, pitroda et al.  <cit>  found that stat <dig> knockdown is associated with alterations in the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the citrate cycle. tyk2/ifn signaling might thus regulate metabolism by targeting mitochondrial processes via stat <dig> 

notably, we observed a particularly pervasive effect of tyk <dig> on lipid and fatty acid metabolism in macrophages. this result fits well with previous studies that have reported intricate but not well understood interactions between immunity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism . for example, lipids can be sensed by and act on toll-like receptors  such as tlr <dig>  probably because tlr agonists like lps contain a biologically active lipid moiety . moreover, macrophages and adipocytes are derived from a common ancestral progenitor and share several transcriptional features, with macrophages expressing some adipocyte specific genes and adipocytes expressing several macrophage specific genes, including il <dig> and tnfα . however, little is currently understood about the downstream effects of impaired ifn signaling on lipid metabolism, as we have observed them in our experiments.

although the biological details remain unclear, several studies have established a link between ifn signaling, innate immunity, and lipid metabolism. mice deficient for interleukin  <dig> receptor antagonist α , for instance, are lean, have impaired body fat accumulation, and exhibit reduced lipoprotein lipase activity  <cit> , and tnfα can increase lipolysis and promote apoptosis of adipocytes  <cit> . moreover, zwaferink et al.  <cit>  have recently reported that key lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase , are suppressed in ifnβ treated mouse bmdms. since we have observed a similar downregulation in tyk <dig> mutant macrophages, and because tyk <dig> deficiency is known to decrease ifnβ levels  <cit> , it might be possible that tyk <dig> influences lipid metabolism through a basal feed-forward loop between ifnβ and tyk <dig> 

our findings are also consistent with our previous observation that tyk <dig> modulates metabolic proteins in bmdms before and after lps treatment  <cit> . however, it remains possible that isolated mouse macrophages display somewhat abnormal metabolic behavior. we found most metabolic genes to be suppressed upon lps treatment in wt macrophages, but in vivo results suggest that wt mice become hypermetabolic ninety minutes after lps injection  <cit> . thus, future studies will need to examine the detailed role of tyk <dig> in regulating metabolism, both in macrophages and other cell types as well as in vivo.

in addition to the irf/isre tfbs already mentioned above, our study also identified several other tfbss that might be involved in the immune and inflammatory response. in particular, we found several genes with 5'ur binding-sites for transcription factors that have not yet been implicated in immunity. for example, some genes with a tata box were upregulated by lps. unfortunately, we cannot decipher this "regulatory code" in mammals with current bioinformatics means, although it might be conserved over quite large phylogenetic distances  <cit> . we also observed five known and one unknown tfbs to be correlated with induction differences between wt and tyk2-/- cells. while further analysis will be required to examine the effect of these motifs, we generally observed similar go classes to be upregulated after six hours of lps as nilsson et al.  <cit>  who studied the expression of genes and gene regulation via 5'ur tfbs in bmdms after seven hours of lps stimulation.

finally, we related our results to information on putative 3'utr elements. we found many more genes per 3'utr element than per 5'ur tfbs, possibly because the 3'utr is evolutionarily more conserved than the 5'ur or because regulation at the 3'utr is more pleiotropic than at the 5'ur. overall, our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of 3'utr elements in the lps response and in the differential regulation of expression between genotypes. several classes of conserved 3'utr regulatory sequences and 3'utr mirna cognate sequences were differentially regulated between genotypes, in response to lps, and in terms of lps inducibility between wt and tyk <dig> mutant cells. most notably, lps strongly induced expression of genes with au-rich elements , which have already previously been implicated in innate immunity  <cit> . in contrast, among the mirna cognate motifs that were differentially regulated in our experiment, none has a known function. thus, since 3'utr conserved elements and mirna consensus sites are still poorly annotated and characterized, it is difficult to biologically interpret these results. nevertheless, it has become clear in recent years that 3'utr elements and mirna cognate sequences are highly important in regulating gene expression, and it will therefore be interesting to explore their potential role in immune and inflammatory transcription.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that tyk <dig> function is required for the full transcriptional response upon lps challenge, but dispensable for the lps induction of ifn-responsive genes. although it remains presently unclear why tyk <dig> mainly mediates baseline but not lps-induced type i ifn signaling, we suggest that tyk <dig> maintains ifn-responsive genes in a primed, "ready to go" state, with factors other than tyk <dig> mediating their induction upon immune challenge. moreover, we conclude that tyk <dig> plays a major but previously unknown role in the regulation of metabolism, especially lipid metabolism. our data suggest that tyk <dig> is not only critically required for the downregulation of baseline expression of many metabolic genes, but also for their further lps-mediated suppression. while these results deserve in-depth future analysis, they clearly strengthen the previously made case for intricate connections between ifn signaling and metabolism and provide evidence for a role of tyk <dig> in this connection. a better understanding of the relationship between immunity and metabolism will also likely be important for improving therapeutic interventions that target immune diseases as well as metabolic disorders.
