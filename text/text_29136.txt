BACKGROUND
steroid hormones are signal molecules that play essential roles in various physiological and pathological processes. in particular, one of the most important factors of regulation commonly applied in medical treatment is the use of hormones. cancer treatment on early stages of tumor development is often associated with action of steroid hormones – progesterone  <cit>  and estrogen  <cit> . steroid hormones are believed to play an important role in the regulation of the development of breast cancer  <cit> .

hormone functions are mediated by hormone-specific receptors which are transcription factors  <cit> . the molecular effects of estrogen and progesterone are reflected by their receptor-regulated gene expression  <cit> . the overall mechanism of the gene expression regulation by steroid hormones in a cell does include several stages of reaction, and up to now, none of them is described in details. in the multi-stage regulation, the "primary target genes" may produce proteins involved in regulation of other genes, causing the second stage of "regulatory answer", and so on. elucidation of the regulation network is further complicated by at least four possible hormone reactions  <cit> :

• usual pathway: hormone receptors  are activated by the correspondent hormones, and then bind directly to hormone response elements  within regulatory areas of dna. binding to regulatory elements induces changes in gene expression;

• hormone receptors can be activated by different signaling molecules other than hormones , and also interact with dna of hres;

• activated hormone receptors bind indirectly to non-hre sites via forming protein complexes together with other transcription factors; and

• different signaling pathways through cellular membrane with effect on tissue responses .

we are especially interested in identification of the "primary target genes" of steroid hormone receptors and differentiation of them from the down-stream targets of these genes. the first step of investigation of the hormone-regulated gene expression network is the hre prediction and analysis. listed in the above, the first and second hormone reactions involve recognition of specific hres.

in general, for the purpose of identification of transcription factor binding sites , a number of tools have been reported, to name a few, matinspector  <cit> , match  <cit>  and mapper  <cit> . however, all of them, being appropriate for genome-scale analysis of trends and frequencies  <cit> , provide too many false positives for investigation of singular sites to be reliable. we need to explore more accurate prediction methods with high sensitivity and specificity. first, a training hre set from both literature and wet-lab experiments should be carefully constructed. then a statistic model should be established with machine learning through the reported specific features of binding sites, in order to distinguish the hres from other dna sequences.

in this study, we exhaustively searched for training hres from more than  <dig> literature sources. two main criteria were taken into account: detection of dna-receptor complex, usually with use of gel shift retardation assay  <cit> ; and confirmed involvement into gene expression regulation, i.e. hormone treatment-associated changes either in mrna or protein level, or in any plasmid construct activity.

we then examined the specific structure of binding sites of interest, which requires investigation of biological nature of hormone receptors. some transcription factors, including the steroid hormone receptors, bind dna as dimers  <cit> . therefore, consensus hormone response element should include two constituent parts, or half-sites, which are usually separated by a short spacer.

two classes of steroid hres have been characterized; androgen, progesterone and glucocorticoid response elements , with a consensus sequence agtacannntgttct, has been studied the most extensively  <cit> . mineralocorticoid receptors can also act via the hre  <cit> . the estrogen response element  consensus sequence ggtcannntgacc can be converted to a functional are/pre/gre by just changing two bases. the sequences are imperfect palindromes to which the receptor dimers bind  <cit> . consensus sequence of the first class of hres is shown in fig.  <dig> 

finally, we developed a statistic model and implemented the tools for prediction of a specific group of steroid hres including the above progesterone, androgen and glucocorticoid whose receptors were reported to share the same response elements  <cit> . our approach involved extensive search for available experimental data and use of an adapted method of sequence representation, position weight matrix, based on nucleotide position frequencies. supervised machine learning was implemented to further improve the prediction accuracy.

RESULTS
experimentally verified hres are used for training the statistic model
the data was collected from more than  <dig> literature sources and our in-house wet-lab experiments. such a collection for hres has no analogs in the current public and commercial databases of tfbs profiles. while a few of the regulatory elements are derived from genes of fish and birds, most of the sites are mammalian and 89% of all sites are from human or rodent genomic dna.

it is also worth mentioning that most collections do not filter out confirmed binding sites from the recognized ones . our aim is to collect sites with binding affinity, whatever their structure is. therefore, only experimentally confirmed binding sites are included into our collection.

it is known that progesterone receptor, androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor tend to share the same binding sites on dna . while that was shown by many experiments, our statistic model further verified it and would serve as an additional control of appropriateness of the training hre collection. none of the experimental methods allow detecting a response element to a single nucleotide precision. therefore, after collection of the sequences, they were aligned  <cit>  and hre motifs within them were detected. position weight matrices were computed with the aligned hres for mono and di-nucleotide patterns.  then, to check the above assumption of the same response element to be shared by three steroid hormone receptors, we used the chi-square criterion for homogeneity, and these three steroid hormones of interest do share the same response elements, with p-value of less than 10- <dig> 

we joined the three position frequency matrices for ar, gr and pr into one position weight matrix of steroid hormone response element, and used this matrix for further prediction of hres. the joined matrix is given in table  <dig> 

combination of mono and di-nucleotide models significantly improves the accuracy
based on the tfbs recognition strategy , we implemented two modules: mono-nucleotide pwm <dig> and di-nucleotide pwm <dig>  each of them was characterized by non-lucrative trade-off between re-value and sensitivity.

with pwm <dig>  a sensitivity of 86% was achieved only with re-value of  <dig> prediction per  <dig> bp , and re-value of 1: <dig> kb corresponds to sensitivity of 73% . with pwm <dig>  a sensitivity of 86% with re-value of 1: <dig> bp  vs. 71% with 1: <dig> kb  was achieved. none of them shows an impressive level of accuracy in recognition.

we then combined the results from two modules; that is, a motif is recognized if it is recognized by both modules. to our expectation, more false positives were removed. this can be achieved because while the first pwm measures only independent single nucleotide frequencies, the second also takes into account di-nucleotides which are often preserved in patterns other than simple combinations of independent nucleotides; for instance, cpg di-nucleotides occur in real genomic sequences much less than the expected rate of 1/ <dig> × 1/ <dig> = 1/ <dig> in arbitrary nucleotides  <cit> .

we indeed managed to eliminate a large number of the false positives, while holding the true positives at a reasonable level. here sensitivity and re-values are functions of two variables, and it is possible to change them by moving in a two-dimensional space. in applications, to solve a specific problem, trade-off is made in regard with which direction to move in the space. in our case, we set the following values for recognition thresholds: pwm <dig> –  <dig> , and for pwm <dig> –  <dig> , in order to receive optimal combination of the sensitivity of 76% and random expectation of  <dig> hit per  <dig>  kb.

supervised machine learning with neural network
we implemented an artificial neural network  to cross-verify the previous pwm-based predictions. ann is to date the best tool to model individual prototypes. due to its inherent nature, an ann structure with enough connections and parameters to fit is able to mime almost any complex pattern.

during supervised learning and testing, most of sequences come to convergence to an exact yes/no answer, but the rest requires setting up a threshold for decision making, when the relation of euclidian distances from the actual ann output to the yes  and no  points is measured.

with the threshold value of  <dig> , we achieved the specificity of  <dig> %, and  <dig> of  <dig> hres were misclassified . when the distance threshold was set to  <dig> , sensitivity level decreased to 89%, i.e.  <dig> of  <dig> true hres were indeed identified, but the specificity reaches as high as  <dig> %.

we initially intended to use the ann model only for cross-validation of the prediction, and through the machine learning process, we eventually further improved the prediction accuracy. the model now implies not only independent nucleotide positions but also a hre sequence as whole. thus, with an appropriate number of neurons, it is possible to reach very high sensitivity and specificity. such an accurate model is approachable, provided that the exhaustive training procedure can be matched by computing power. we are currently in development of hardware acceleration of ann training models  <cit> .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
one can hardly declare that each hre predicted by the model is functional and involved in regulation of gene expression, though we have confirmed that our model can detect potential hres with high confidence. our correctly predicted hres cover most of the microarray-verified progesterone primary target genes. the average number of the found pres in promoter area for  <dig> human pr-responsive genes listed in  <cit>  is  <dig> ; for the total set of human genes, this value is  <dig>  hres per promoter. note that the promoter area is set from - <dig> to + <dig> according to the annotated transcription start site. in the current work, genbank build # <dig>  has been used.

the highest probability of steroid hormone primary target gene was found for human mmp <dig> gene encoding for matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> . its promoter contains three predicted hres, and two of them are adjacent and with a very high chance to be functional  <cit> . steroid hormone progesterone was previously reported to reduce level of human mmp <dig> gene expression significantly  <cit> . the second significant pr-responsive gene ngrf was also reported to be progesterone-regulated  <cit> .

the unsupervised learning of pwms and the supervised learning procedure of anns imply different strategies for both modeling of hre pattern and training the model. as for the structure, the probability score of pwm-predicted score is additive along the sequence of single model units , while the ann takes the input hre sequence as a whole. that explains why, with comparable specificity value, ann fits much close to a given training set of response elements. major difference in learning lies in the strategy of binding site recognition. neural network has both positive and negative patterns for the training, and thus the final recognition procedure during testing is a selection between two stable points – neutral or potential regulatory sequence. it can be understood why higher specificity value can be expected for the ann model. however, as shown in our experiment, training a highly accurate ann model takes a prohibitivly long time on our current workstation. hardware acceleration such as field-programmable gate arrays may provide us with a solution.

though, with use of ann, we managed to model the hre training set and separate it from the neutral dna sequences quite well, some outliers were detected as well. they were found through non-consensus binding sites for progesterone, androgen and glucocorticoid receptors in the promoters and gene regions for a number of genes: rabbit uteroglobin gene  <cit> , chicken lysozyme gene  <cit> , porcine uteroferrin gene  <cit> , pro-opiomelanocortin gene  <cit> , murine c-myc gene  <cit> , late leader of the control region of the human polyomavirus bk  <cit> , gene promoter of two milk protein genes   <cit> , human na/k atpase α  <dig> gene promoter  <cit> , and mouse sex-limited protein enhancer  <cit> . the first three are progesterone-regulated genes, the next five are glucocorticoid primary targets, and the last one is associated with androgen activity. unless they are experimental artifacts, the possible explanation could lie in the area of complex protein-dna interaction which is beyond dna sequence similarity itself, like secondary molecular structure of dna or location of surrounding nucleosomes. nevertheless, more sensitive procedures should be implemented. the subspace of hres looks like to be non-uniform and can be clustered into different types  <cit> , possibly avoiding more false positive in future model development.

in conclusion, our proposed model for steroid receptor binding sites prediction can be used for determination of androgen, progesterone and glucocorticoid primary target genes, detection of steroid hormone response elements de novo, and evaluation of known hres. it is a crucial starting-point for reconstruction of the global hormone-regulated gene expression network, which is indeed a great challenge for both molecular biology and life science in general.
