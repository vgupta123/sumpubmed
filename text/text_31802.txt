BACKGROUND
current thinking in regenerative medicine envisions the derivation, from autogeneic somatic cells, of pluripotent cells that can be directed to differentiate into transplantable replacements for cells destroyed by injury or disease  <cit> . beyond this, however, is another goal: the chemical induction of regeneration directly at the site of tissue damage  <cit> . achievement of this goal will require a deep understanding of the molecular components, networks and pathways that characterize regenerative competence. urodele amphibians , which regenerate amputated limbs perfectly throughout larval and adult life, provide a research model that lends itself well to furthering our understanding of this process. two hundred fifty years after lazzaro spallanzani first demonstrated the regeneration of amputated newt limbs  <cit> , we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of this process. urodele limbs initiate regeneration through the formation of a blastema: a limb bud-like structure composed of undifferentiated progenitor cells. blastema cells originate by a reverse developmental process in which the tissue matrix near the amputation plane is degraded by proteases, releasing both mature cells that are reprogrammed to a mesenchymal stem cell-like state, and muscle stem cells   <cit> . within a few days after amputation, these cells accumulate under the apical epidermal cap , where they proliferate and are patterned into the missing limb parts.

the ability to form a blastema is what distinguishes urodele limbs from the limbs of most other tetrapod vertebrates that do not regenerate or which regenerate poorly. thus, understanding the mechanisms that lead to blastema formation is crucial to understanding why urodele limbs regenerate, and why the limbs of other species do not. in general, the reductionist approach has been to study the individual genes or proteins involved in biological processes. with the development of high throughput technology over the last decade, there has been a shift in this approach. the ability to obtain large scale omics data has led to the development of discovery approaches that interrelate the elements of biological processes, revealing networks and pathways of organization in a system  <cit> . very few studies so far have analyzed global gene or protein expression patterns during limb regeneration. in the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum, expressed sequence tag  resources have been developed  <cit>  and transcription profiles of denervated vs. innervated limbs have been analyzed  <cit> . some global studies have been performed in an anuran amphibian, the frog xenopus laevis. however, unlike urodeles, xenopus possesses the ability to regenerate lost limbs in early tadpole stages of development, but gradually loses the capability for regeneration as development proceeds, until it is lost completely in adults  <cit> . xenopus studies have focused on subtractive hybridization  <cit> ; microarray analysis  <cit>  and proteomics  <cit>  for molecular screening of limb regeneration.

although extensive research has been carried out to understand how the blastema is formed and which molecular entities are crucial to regeneration, very little is known about the interactive pathways and networks that lead to blastema formation in an amputated limb. recently, we conducted a proteomic analysis of blastema formation in the amputated limbs of ambystoma mexicanum. our analysis revealed a number of significant changes in protein expression related to cell signaling, transcription, metabolism, cell protection, and cell cycle  <cit> . we are now engaged in a broad, systems level analysis of high throughput datasets in limb regeneration. here we focus on the networks and pathways regulated by the transcription factors  c-myc  and sp <dig> , which we found to be connected to  <dig> % of the proteins expressed during axolotl limb regeneration blastema formation. in particular, we found that tgf-β <dig>  could potentially lead to the activation of sp <dig> and then to the expression of fn , which is produced by the blastema cells and the aec. in turn, fn activates c-myc via integrins and the wnt pathway. within these pathways we identified several tfs such as smad <dig> , which may be involved in limb regeneration. in addition, klf <dig> , oct <dig> , and lin <dig>  tfs common to embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent cells  and blastema cells  <cit> , were also found to be connected to c-myc and sp <dig>  our results highlight the utility of systems biology for understanding complex processes such as limb regeneration.

methods
processing of axolotl proteomics data
network and pathway analysis was based on proteomics data obtained at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-amputation  in our study of blastema formation in the hindlimb of the wild-type axolotl, ambystoma mexicanum  <cit> . in that study,  <dig> high confidence peptides were identified with significant fold changes relative to control on one or more dpa. since bioinformatics resources for the axolotl are limited, we identified human orthologs for these peptides. the search was carried out against the homo sapiens database  using the blastp tool  available from ncbi   <cit> . the peptides in the original study were five to thirty three amino acids long and were aligned throughout their length for ortholog identification. a human ortholog was used only if the percentage identity between an axolotl: human peptide was greater than 85%; unmatched peptides were excluded from the analysis. although proteins with lower percentage identities could well be important, lc/ms/ms analysis relies on peptide sequences for alignment, not complete protein sequences, making it essential to set a high percentage identity threshold for stringency. the uniprot database  <cit>  was used to assign the gene name to each of the human orthologs. the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit>  was used for the assessment of biological processes. the ortholog data was divided into  <dig> groups with respect to up- and down-regulated proteins at each time point: 1d-, 1d+, 4d-, 4d+, 7d-, and 7d+. thus, 1d- refers to all down-regulated proteins at  <dig> dpa, and 1d+ refers to all up-regulated proteins at 1dpa; all other groups are interpreted in a similar manner.

network analysis
 <dig>  tf connectivity map
all the human orthologs identified from the axolotl proteomics data were used as a bait to identify tfs connected to these orthologs. few proteins had upstream  interactions with these tfs, so only downstream  interactions were used to construct a unidirectional connectivity map. transcription factor identification was done using the transcription regulation algorithm from the commercial software metacore™ version  <dig> , build  <dig>  which is based on manual curation. this algorithm generated sub-networks centered on tfs that have direct links to our bait list data. transcription factors were ranked according to their p-value, based on hypergeometric distribution  <cit> . the ranking represents the probability of picking up a tf by chance, considering the number of bait list proteins it mapped to from our data versus the number of genes in the network within the full set of all proteins in the networks. that is, the higher the number of direct interactions for a tf in the given proteomic dataset, the lower is the p-value. a tf connectivity map was constructed using the radial tree layout in cytoscape  <cit> .

 <dig>  upstream receptor identification
networks were built to specifically target the upstream pathways that activate the tfs c-myc and sp <dig>  receptors of upstream pathways were identified using the analyze network  algorithm from metacore™. this algorithm generates a network for each receptor in the input data consisting of the shortest paths from it to the nearest tf. a similar p-value score, as described above, was used for the statistical evaluation of networks.

pathway analysis
the target proteins of c-myc and sp <dig> in the bait list as well as the rest of the proteins were evaluated for significant pathways with respect to up and downregulated groups at each time point. statistical significance was measured by the number of proteins that map onto a given pathway. hence, this method did not identify pathways for each individual protein, but rather those which are more likely to be prevalent in the groups mentioned above. the significance was calculated on the basis of z-score .

RESULTS
 <dig>  temporal and functional data analysis
 <dig>  transcription factor analysis
to understand a complex biological process such as limb regeneration, it is crucial to elucidate and understand its regulatory machinery. one of the limitations of the lc/ms/ms method used in our original proteomic analysis of blastema formation in axolotl limbs  <cit>  is that it often fails to identify proteins expressed in low amounts and post translationally modified proteins   <cit> . as a result, certain growth factors, signaling molecules and tfs have a higher probability of going undetected. we used the human ortholog bait list to fish out the missed tfs by using the manually curated metacore™ database. significance is based on the number of proteins to which the tfs connected in our data. supplementary material contains information about the five most significant tfs in each data group , the number of target proteins to which each tf linked from our bait list, a p-value to describe their significance, and the enriched go processes .

c-myc and sp <dig> were found to regulate  <dig> unique target proteins from our data. this number was calculated by removing all overlapping proteins between c-myc and sp <dig>  thus, c-myc and sp <dig> alone were responsible for potentially regulating  <dig> % of the target proteins from the bait list. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the c-myc and sp <dig> networks, respectively, with all the target proteins to which they connected.

 <dig>  network construction and pathway analysis
once c-myc and sp <dig> were identified as the most significant tfs, further investigation of the interacting upstream and downstream elements for these tfs was carried out. downstream elements were the target proteins for these tfs in our data . these networks were statistically found to be the most significant in our data. many other proteins not identified by our proteomics screen but well established in limb regeneration, such as mmps   <cit>  and annexins  <cit>  were also present in these networks. this further validates the significance of the networks with respect to limb regeneration.

we identified several canonical pathways known to be present in humans or mice  <cit>  spread across these networks. we found that tgf-β <dig> activates sp <dig> through smad proteins. one of the downstream targets of sp <dig> is fn . fibronectin then activates c-myc via integrins and the wnt pathway. these paths are highlighted in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

the most significant pathways regulated by target proteins of c-myc and sp <dig> in our data are provided in the supplementary information . supplementary information also provides the pathways that were identified using the remainder of the proteins not regulated by either c-myc or sp <dig> . among the pathways identified, several are already well established in limb regeneration such as cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion and development related, thus validating the approach. some pathways that have been of interest recently in limb regeneration such as cell cycle, immune response, and metabolism were also identified  <cit> .

 <dig>  stemness in limb regeneration
blastema cells express tfs associated with stemness   <cit> . recently, combinations of the tfs c-myc, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  lin <dig>  and nanog have been shown to reprogram adult fibroblasts to ipscs  <cit> . c-myc has been shown to enhance the ability of oct <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig> to induce pluripotency up to  <dig> fold  <cit> . however, high levels of c-myc are only transiently required and sustained levels were found to lead to tumors  <cit> . c-myc, klf <dig> and sox <dig> have been shown to be expressed in regenerating newt limb tissue, and lin <dig> in regenerating axolotl limb tissue  <cit> . hence, we constructed a network  that included all of these tfs to evaluate their significance for stemness in a mammalian system. this figure shows how mammalian stem cells might be related to urodele blastema cells. the various symbols used in the network have been described in detail in the supplementary information .

discussion
 <dig>  human ortholog identification
our previous proteomics study  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially regulated proteins at three time points  during blastema formation in regenerating axolotl limbs. here we used the human orthologs of these  <dig> proteins as bait to identify potential associations with other proteins that were not identified in the proteomics screen. we obtained  <dig> significant human orthologs for  <dig> axolotl proteins and used them to construct interactive protein networks. our focus was on the identification of significant tfs and molecules regulating or regulated by these tfs that might be key to axolotl limb regeneration.

 <dig>  temporal and functional data analysis
we first separated the orthologs into up and down regulated groups for each day post-amputation. in both the up and down regulated groups, very few proteins  were unique to day  <dig>  this suggests that day  <dig> proteins are involved in carrying out biological processes similar to either day  <dig> or day  <dig>  most of the proteins were either up regulated at all time points or down regulated at all time points. those down regulated at all time points were enriched for proteins involved in development, cell structure and motility, muscle contractile activity, carbohydrate metabolism, cell cycle, and mrna splicing, whereas those up regulated at all time points were enriched for intracellular protein trafficking, endocytosis, chromatin packaging and neurotransmitter release .

 <dig>  transcription factor network analysis
next, we derived a tf-centric protein interaction network using commercially available metacore™ software to identify all human tfs that were connected to at least five proteins in the data. the five most highly connected tfs, c-myc, sp <dig>  hnf4a, esr <dig> and p <dig>  were found to regulate almost half of the proteins  in our data. of these, c-myc and sp <dig> alone were found to regulate  <dig> % of the proteins. c-myc was the most highly connected tf  and also had the highest number of unique targets  while sp <dig> had the next highest tfs. for these reasons, we focused on these two tfs.

c-myc is involved in various biological processes such as proliferation, growth, apoptosis, energy metabolism and differentiation  <cit> . it has been shown to act with β-catenin to inhibit wound healing by interfering with differentiation in chronic ulcers  <cit>  and is expressed in regenerating limb and lens of the newt notophthalmus viridescens. in the regenerating newt limb, in-situ hybridization has shown that c-myc is localized in both the epidermis and subjacent blastema cells. this expression has been correlated with the maintenance of blastema cell proliferation  <cit> . recently, along with other stem cell factors, c-myc expression in the regenerating newt limb was found to be highest during the dedifferentiation phase of blastema formation. expression then decreased at later stages but still remained higher than the control tissue  <cit> . these studies have related c-myc to proliferation as well as stemness, but the downstream targets of c-myc which result in these effects have not been identified. here, we have identified  <dig> downstream targets of c-myc in our bait list. these targets are involved in various biological processes/pathways related to limb regeneration. using this information, hypotheses about the specific role of c-myc in limb regeneration can be proposed and tested.

specificity factor <dig> was the second highest connected tf . sp <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed protein and has varied roles in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and immune response. it is known to interact with cyclins which promote the g1/s phase transition, as well as with cyclin-dependent inhibitors that inhibit progression through the cell cycle. similarly, its target genes include both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes and pro- and anti-angiogenic genes. specificity factor <dig> is also linked to chromatin remodeling through its interaction with p <dig> and histone deacetylases  and is known to interact with several tfs including c-myc in order to activate several downstream target genes. however, sp <dig> action is highly dependent on its interaction with other members of the sp family and extracellular signals  <cit> . this is the first time sp <dig> has been identified in relation to limb regeneration and no studies have yet been done on the specific role it plays in limb regeneration.

 <dig>  stem cell factors in limb regeneration
a number of tfs associated with stemness are expressed during blastema formation. some of these, such as the hox and meis genes, regulate pattern formation in the growing blastema  <cit> , whereas others such as msx- <dig>  nrad, klf <dig>  oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and lin <dig> are associated with dedifferentiation and proliferation  <cit> . with the exception of lin <dig>  we did not identify any of these tfs in our proteomic analysis of blastema formation in the axolotl hind limb  <cit> , but figure  <dig> demonstrates that they interact with c-myc and sp <dig>  this suggests that c- myc and sp <dig> are central to a network of tfs that regulate mesenchymal stem cell properties of the blastema and that play a role in the nuclear reprogramming of differentiated limb cells to blastema cells.

 <dig>  pathway analysis
next we mapped out the pathways of two molecules, tgf-β <dig> and fn, that connect sp <dig> and c-myc, respectively, and which are known to be important in mammalian tissue repair and urodele limb regeneration. within the tgf superfamily, the tgf-β and bmp subfamilies of growth factors are major players in skin wound repair and bone regeneration. transforming growth factor beta isoforms attract immune cells into skin wounds, and induce the migration and proliferation of skin fibroblasts to form granulation tissue. transforming growth factor β activates many target genes in wound healing, including connective tissue growth factor  and fn  <cit> .

the wound epidermis covering the amputation surface plays a crucial role in blastema formation  <cit> . establishment of the wound epidermis after amputation of the xenopus tadpole tail requires tgf-β signaling  <cit> . tgf-β and smad  <dig> are up regulated early in formation of the wound epidermis and later in the tissues of the blastema. inhibition of tgf-β signaling with the inhibitor of smad phosphorylation sb- <dig> immediately after amputation prevents establishment of the wound epidermis and inhibits the signaling cascades that initiate blastema formation. fibronectin is an important substrate molecule for both migrating epidermal cells and fibroblasts of wounds. fn is strongly upregulated during blastema formation in axolotl limb regeneration  <cit> . a prerequisite for blastema formation and growth in urodele limb regeneration is the thickening of the initial wound epidermis to form the aec. fibronectin is an important component of the blastemal ecm and is highly expressed by the basal layer of the aec starting within  <dig> hrs after amputation, as well as by blastema cells themselves  <cit> . the aec appears to direct the migration of blastema cells to form the accumulation blastema beneath it. this was shown by experiments in which shifting the position of the aec laterally caused a corresponding shift in blastema cell accumulation  <cit> , and transplantation of an additional aec to the base of the blastema resulted in supernumerary blastema formation  <cit> . the redirected accumulation of blastema cells in these experiments may be due to the migration of the cells on fn produced by the eccentric aec. tgf-β <dig> is strongly up regulated during blastema formation in amputated axolotl limbs  <cit> . fn is a target gene of tgf-β <dig> that is highly expressed by basal cells of the wound epidermis during blastema formation  <cit> . inhibition of tgf-β <dig> expression with sb- <dig>  reduces fn expression and results in failure of blastema formation  <cit> , again suggesting that fn provided by the aec provides directional guidance for blastema cells.

in the present study, we identified a canonical pathway in which tgf-β <dig> leads to the activation of sp <dig> through tgf-β receptors and smad <dig>  transforming growth factor-β <dig> is one of the major inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation  via smad family member proteins   <cit> . the epidermal cells that establish the wound epidermis in regenerating urodeles limbs take on some of the characteristics of mesenchymal cells, shedding their specialized epithelial junctions and up regulating cytoskeletal components essential for migration. tgf-β <dig> binds type i and type ii receptor serine/threonine kinases. the receptor type ii phosphorylates the receptor type i, which activate smads  <cit>  and smad <dig> then leads to activation of sp <dig> which is capable of activating fn  <cit> . interestingly, there is a non-canonical tgf-β <dig> pathway in which smad  <dig> can repress c-myc through a novel repressive smad binding element within the tgf-β inhibitory element of the c-myc promoter  <cit> . wound epidermal cells migrating over the amputation surface do not divide  <cit> . in this context, smad <dig> could possibly inhibit the division of migrating epidermal cells via this pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we asked whether the use of proteins identified in a proteomic analysis of blastema formation in amputated axolotl hindlimbs could be used as bait to identify transcription factors and their downstream targets involved in blastema formation, and construct these into interactive protein networks and pathways. we identified multiple targets of c-myc and sp <dig>  and also several upstream molecules  that lead to the activation of c-myc and sp <dig>  we conclude that this strategy can be successful, not only for transcription factors and their targets, but for other molecules as well that might be important to regeneration and/or wound repair.

the next step is to construct hypotheses that allow experimental testing of the roles of the molecules comprising the interactive protein pathways in regeneration-competent limbs. this will unite the question-driven approach used here with the hypothesis-driven approach. both are equally important for analysis and synthesis of data derived from complex biological processes. we are currently testing one hypothesis about the role of the centrosomal protein evi <dig>  and the pathways it forms with several other proteins regulating the cell cycle during blastema formation and growth  <cit> .

finally, by deriving proteomic data from a regeneration-deficient system such as the limbs of xenopus froglets, and applying a bioinformatics/systems biology approach, we have the possibility of identifying a set of proteins, networks and pathways that can be compared to that of the regeneration-competent axolotl to reveal the basis for the difference between the two.
