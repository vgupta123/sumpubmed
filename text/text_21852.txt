BACKGROUND
protein palmitoylation, or s-acylation, is a reversible post-translational modification that adds a 16-carbon saturated palmitate group to the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine to form a thioester  <cit> . such modifications affect protein trafficking, protein interactomes and protein stability  <cit> . palmitoylation, usually combined with other lipid modifications such as n-myristolyation and prenylation, provides a hydrophobic membrane anchor on otherwise soluble proteins, enhancing their membrane association  <cit> . transmembrane  proteins, such as receptor kinases and transporters, can also be modified by palmitoylation, which often affects their subcellular targeting and dynamic sorting among different endomembrane compartments  <cit> .

palmitoyl proteomics indicated that eukaryotes contain a large number of palmitoylated proteins  <cit> . most of palmitoylated proteins, such as small gtpases, receptor tyrosine kinases, transporters, and n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-activating protein receptors , are involved in cell signaling and intracellular transport  <cit> . in plants, a few proteins have been experimentally demonstrated to be modified by palmitoylation, including rop gtpases  <cit> , cbls  <cit> , subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins  <cit> , protein phosphatases  <cit> , and the receptor kinase flagellin-sensing  <dig>  <cit> . modification of these key signaling proteins implies that palmitoylation plays crucial roles in plant growth.

three types of enzymes are reported to catalyze protein palmitoylation  <cit> , among which protein s-acyl transferases , characterized by an evolutionarily conserved and catalytically critical asp-his-his-cys  motif within a cysteine-rich domain, play dominant roles  <cit> . dhhc-type pats are encoded in all eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . as transmembrane™ proteins, pats are found at different endomembrane compartments including the golgi, endoplasmic reticulum , the plasma membrane , and vacuolar membrane in yeast  <cit> . recently, it was shown that arabidopsis pats have more diverse targeting than their yeast or metazoan counterparts, at the pm, the golgi, er, the tonoplast, or various vesicles of distinct identities  <cit> . two plant pats have been functionally characterized  <cit> . arabidopsis tip growth defective <dig> /pat <dig> encodes a pat with ankyrin repeats, whose mutations result in defective growth both in tip-growing cells, i.e. root hairs and pollen tubes, and in non-tip-growing cells  <cit> . we recently characterized a tonoplast-localized pat, protein s-acyl transferase <dig> , which is critical for vacuolar function  <cit> . in the pat <dig> mutants, several cbls lost their palmitoylation-dependent tonoplast association  <cit> , suggesting that these cbls are the substrates of pat <dig> 

despite the importance of protein palmitoylation for plant growth, progress in understanding plant pat functions has been slow due to redundancy and overlapping substrate specificity  <cit> . we report here that protein palmitoylation regulates the polar growth of root hairs by using a pharmacological approach in combination with genetics. root hair growth requires the dynamic distribution of intracellular activities such as actin mf  <cit>  and membrane trafficking  <cit> . many proteins mediating such dynamic activities are likely regulated by palmitoylation based on evolutionary conservation  <cit>  or results from palmitoyl proteomics  <cit> . thus, root hairs represent an excellent single cell system to study the effect of protein palmitoylation on multiple intracellular activities.

we show that the golgi-localized tip <dig> plays a major role while the tonoplast-localized pat <dig> plays a minor role in the polar growth of root hairs. by application of 2-bromopalmitate  that specifically inhibits protein palmitoylation in vitro  <cit>  and in planta  <cit> , we show here that inhibiting palmitoylation directly or indirectly impaired actin mf polymerization, abolished the restricted pm localization of pip <dig>  disrupted the dynamic distribution of raba4b-positive post-golgi secretion, and inhibited vacuolar trafficking, resulting in defective root hair growth. thus our results demonstrate the role of protein palmitoylation in intracellular activities that contribute to cell morphogenesis in root hairs and provide experimental evidences to narrow down potential pat targets in plants.

RESULTS
optimization of 2-bp treatment on root hair growth
to examine cellular processes affected by 2-bp in root hairs, it was necessary to develop a suitable treatment regime that would reveal the effects of inhibiting protein palmitoylation on cellular processes without causing severe cellular damages. to do so, we utilized the subcellular localization of cbl <dig> as an indicator for the effective inhibition of palmitoylation. cbl <dig> dissociated from the tonoplast and moved to the cytoplasm when its key palmitoylation site was mutated  <cit>  or in the pat <dig> mutants  <cit> . based on previous studies  <cit> , we added 2-bp at a final concentration of 10 μm to 50 μm to proubq10:cbl2-rfp transgenic seedlings 4 days after germination  in a hypotonic ms solution, to determine the effects on the tonoplast association of cbl <dig>  because 2-bp was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide , equivalent volumes of dmso were applied as controls in which no phenotypic consequences were detected over the time course of the experiments . as an additional control, we also introduced the same proubq10:cbl2-rfp transgene into pat10- <dig> by crosses  <cit> , in which cbl <dig> was rendered cytosolic . as expected, 2-bp treatment resulted in gradual relocalization of cbl <dig> from the tonoplast to the cytoplasm of root hairs . root hairs incubated with 10 μm 2-bp for 2–3 hrs showed the most substantial reduction of cbl <dig> at the tonoplast  and at 12 hrs showed complete absence of tonoplast-cbl <dig> . increasing 2-bp concentration from 10 μm to 50 μm did not substantially accelerate the tonoplast dissociation of cbl <dig> but induced extensive vacuolation . based on these results, we used 10 μm 2-bp on root hairs and examined cellular processes from  <dig> to 12 hrs after 2-bp application for further experiments.figure  <dig>

root hair growth was impaired by 2-bp
we examined the effect of inhibiting protein palmitoylation on the initiation and polar growth of root hairs. application of 10 μm 2-bp for 12 hrs did not cause a substantial change in primary root length . however, compared to roots treated with dmso, those treated with 2-bp showed a much expanded region of root hair initiation , suggesting inhibited root hair elongation. indeed, the polar growth of root hairs was significantly affected by 2-bp treatment, such that root hairs were shorter and wider than those treated with dmso at the maturation zone . in addition, 2-bp caused extensive vacuolation in growing root hairs, compared to root hairs treated only with dmso .figure  <dig>

most arabidopsis pats represented on the ath <dig> chip  <cit>  are expressed in root hairs or pollen tubes . indeed, tip <dig> mutants exhibited defective growth in both root hairs and pollen tubes  <cit> . tip <dig> was shown to be golgi-localized  <cit>  by using transient expression in tobacco epidermal cells. however, transient heterogeneous expression with strong constitutive promoters does not always reflect the native localization of proteins, as is the case for pat <dig>  <cit> . to determine its native localization, we introduced a tip <dig> genomic fragment-gfp translational fusion driven by its native promoter  into tip1- <dig>  a novel null mutant . tip1g-gfp fully restored the root hair defects of tip1- <dig> , indicating that the gfp fusion did not interfere with its functionality. to verify that the punctate vesicles labeled by tip <dig> were of golgi identity, we applied the lipophilic dye fm4- <dig> and the fungal toxin brefeldin a  to tip1g-gfp;tip1- <dig> roots. fm4- <dig> enters cells via endocytic trafficking and sequentially labels trans-golgi network/early endosomes , prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies , then finally reaches the tonoplast  <cit> . bfa interferes with the activity of arf gtpases and its application resulted in the formation of so-called bfa compartments with a tgn/ee core surrounded by aggregates of golgi  <cit> . fm4- <dig> uptake together with bfa treatment confirmed the localization of tip <dig> at the golgi . to find out whether tip <dig> played a dominant role in root hair growth, we applied 2-bp to tip1- <dig> roots and analyzed root hair morphology. there were slight but not significant morphological changes to root hair length and width in 2-bp-treated tip1- <dig> , suggesting that tip <dig> is a major pat functioning in root hairs.figure  <dig>

pat <dig> is also expressed in root hairs . however, it was unclear whether pat <dig> played a role in root hair growth  <cit> . in pat10g-gfp;pat10- <dig>  pat <dig> was localized at the tonoplast of root hairs at all stages . we therefore analyzed the root hair morphology of pat10- <dig> in the absence or presence of 2-bp. root hair initiation and polarity was not affected, as hair width was comparable between wt and pat10- <dig> . however, root hair length was significantly reduced by pat <dig> loss-of-function . treatment of 2-bp resulted in similar defects in pat10- <dig> as in wild type , i.e. root hair initiation was substantially inhibited . these results suggest that protein palmitoylation is important for root hair growth, with tip <dig> plays a major role and other pats, such as pat <dig>  also participating.

2-bp disrupts actin mf polymerization and the asymmetric pm localization of pip2
because 2-bp treatment significantly affected the polar growth of root hairs, we explored the underlying mechanisms by examining the effects of 2-bp on critical intracellular activities during root hair growth such as the dynamic polymerization of actin mf  <cit>  and the asymmetric pm distribution of pip <dig>  <cit> . to analyze actin mf dynamics, we treated arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing gfp-abd2-gfp, which specifically labels actin mf  <cit>  with either 10 μm 2-bp or dmso and examined the pattern of actin mf in root hairs. in root hairs treated with dmso, longitudinal or slightly helical actin cables extended to the subapical region from the base while short actin bundles as indicated by punctate filamentous signals were present in the apical region where active growth occurred . by contrast, treatment with 2-bp caused fragmentation as well as extensive cross-linking of actin mf . as a result, few longitudinal actin cables were observed in 2-bp-treated bulging root hairs . instead, numerous short actin filaments formed a mesh-like network extending to the apical region . in elongating root hairs under 2-bp treatment, actin cables along the root hair shank were dotted with punctate actin aggregates . these effects occurred as quickly as 2–3 hrs after 2-bp treatment, indicating the sensitivity of the dynamic polymerization of actin mf. treatment of root hairs with the actin mf depolymerization drug latrunculin b  indicated that depolymerization of actin mf did result in punctate aggregates . however, latb treatment did not cause extensive cross-linking of actin mf in root hairs , in contrast to those treated with 2-bp . these results suggest that the effect of 2-bp on actin mf polymerization is complex.figure  <dig>

to determine the effect of 2-bp on the asymmetric pm localization of pip <dig>  we treated a p15y fluorescence sensor line  <cit>  with 2-bp or with dmso. the p15y sensor line expresses a proubq10-driven pip2-binding tubby-c fused with citrine  <cit> . as shown by other pip <dig> sensors  <cit> , pip <dig> was asymmetrically localized at the pm of initiation sites in trichoblasts . during hair elongation, pip <dig> maintained its asymmetric pm localization at the apical region . application of 2-bp significantly redistributed fluorescence signals from the pm to cytosol , suggesting abolished pip <dig> at the pm. for root hairs either at the initiation stage  or at the elongating stage , pip <dig> was detected mostly in the cytoplasm and hardly at all at the pm. the residual signals at the pm were uniform  rather than asymmetric .figure  <dig>

the effect of 2-bp on the dynamic polymerization of actin mf and pip <dig> distribution indicated polarity defects. because actin mf and pip <dig> distribution in tip-growing plant cells are regulated by or associated with rop gtpases  <cit>  that are subjected to palmitoylation  <cit> , we wondered if 2-bp treatment could redistribute rop gtpases into the cytoplasm or cause an uniform localization at the pm rather than the apex-restricted pm localization in root hairs  <cit> . to this end, we applied either dmso or 2-bp to proe7:gfp-rop <dig> transgenic seedlings in which rop <dig>  the key rop gtpase regulating root hair growth  <cit> , was driven by a root hair-specific promoter  <cit> . rop <dig> was concentrated at the pm of hair initiation sites in trichoblasts of proe7:gfp-rop <dig> transgenic seedlings treated with dmso , as previously reported  <cit> . expression of rop <dig> caused root hair bulging . likely due to the overexpression effect, ectopic rop <dig> signals were detected along the pm as well as in the cortical cytoplasm . by contrast, 2-bp treatment induced rapid re-localization of rop <dig> from the pm to the cytoplasm . significant differences were observed as early as 30 min after 2-bp treatment .figure  <dig>

raba4b-positive post-golgi secretion was impaired by 2-bp in root hairs
polarized growth requires regulated exocytosis to deliver building materials for membranes and cell walls. in arabidopsis root hairs, raba4b-mediated secretory vesicles form an inverted cone-shaped pattern critical for polarized growth  <cit> . to determine the effect of 2-bp on raba4b-positive post-golgi secretion, we applied either 2-bp or dmso to  <dig> dag seedlings transformed with pro35s:rfp-raba4b. as reported previously  <cit> , rfp-raba4b was dynamically distributed to the apical cytoplasm in the form of an inverted cone with a trail in growing root hairs, which was not disturbed by dmso . such a distribution pattern was dynamically maintained as long as root hairs grew . application of 2-bp incurred two noticeable effects in root hairs: it disrupted the tip-focused inverted cone pattern and caused aggregation of raba4b-positive vesicles . the effects of 2-bp were observed as early as 2 hr after treatment , suggesting that post-golgi secretory trafficking was sensitive to the inhibition of protein palmitoylation. disruption of the tip-focused raba4b-distribution pattern correlated with the growth kinetics of root hairs, in that raba4b was more concentrated in the apical region than in the shank region in growing root hairs  whereas completely dissipated into punctates in non-growing root hairs . despite the disruption on raba4b-positive secretory trafficking, by following single aggregates during time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that at least some vesicles were able to be exocytosed .figure  <dig>

2-bp inhibits endocytic and vacuolar trafficking
the disrupted raba4b distribution pattern by 2-bp prompted us to test whether endocytosis was affected because polarized growth requires balanced exocytosis and endocytosis to maintain the dynamic integrity of the cell membranes and walls. fm4- <dig> enters into plant cells through the pm by endocytosis and eventually reaches the tonoplast  <cit> . to determine whether 2-bp interfered with endocytic trafficking, we pre-treated  <dig> dag seedlings with 10 μm 2-bp or dmso for 2 hrs before pulse-labeling the roots with 4 μm fm4- <dig>  in both initiating  and elongating root hairs  pre-treated with dmso, fm4- <dig> was internalized from the pm into the tgn/ee . by contrast, no cytosolic vesicles were observed in root hairs pre-treated with 2-bp during the time course of the experiment  either in initiating root hairs  or in elongated root hairs , indicating complete inhibition of endocytosis.figure  <dig>

endocytic trafficking starts at the pm and ends at the vacuole. to find out whether vacuolar trafficking was influenced by 2-bp treatment, we followed the endocytic trafficking of fm4- <dig> to the tonoplast. fm4- <dig> labeled both cytosolic vesicles and the tonoplast after 30–40 min uptake in root hairs . because bfa treatment caused aggregation of fm4-64-labeled tgn/ee into bfa compartments , we reasoned that a bfa washout would allow us to examine the process of vacuolar trafficking from tgn/ee via pvc/mvb to vacuoles. in root hairs treated with dmso, bfa washout led to the labeling of fm4- <dig> of the tonoplast , indicating undisturbed trafficking from the tgn/ee to vacuoles. however, in the presence of 2-bp, bfa washout resulted in dissipation of fm4- <dig> signals from the bfa compartments . furthermore, fm4- <dig> was redistributed mostly to the pm rather than to the tonoplast , suggesting that 2-bp caused mis-sorting of vesicles originally destined to vacuoles.figure  <dig> 
2-bp interfered with vacuolar trafficking. a-d.  <dig> dag wt seedlings were pulse-labeled with fm4- <dig>  washed and incubated for 30 min , or pulse-labeled with fm4- <dig> followed by 30 min incubation with 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 50 μm bfa . bfa-treated seedlings were then washed with 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with either dmso   or 2-bp  . arrows point at the tonoplat labeled by fm4- <dig>  arrowhead indicates the bfa compartment. results are representative of  <dig> root hairs for each treatment. bars =  <dig>  μm.



to further support the idea that 2-bp inhibited vacuolar trafficking, we applied either 2-bp or dmso to root hairs expressing yfp-2xfyve, which binds specifically to pi3p  <cit> . because pi3p goes to vacuoles for degradation through vacuolar trafficking routes from tgn/ee to pvc/mvb, we reasoned that this would serve as a good biosensor for vacuolar trafficking  <cit> . indeed, 2-bp but not dmso induced the formation of ring-shaped compartments positive for pi3p, to an extent similar to but less substantial than that caused by wortmannin , through which pvc/mvbs on their way to vacuoles fuse to form ring-shaped compartments  <cit> . these results indicated that vacuole trafficking through the tgn/ee and pvc/mvbs was compromised by 2-bp.

discussion
as a reversible post-translational modification, protein palmitoylation has been extensively studied in polarized cell growth in metazoans  <cit> . by using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that protein palmitoylation, contributed primarily by the golgi-localized tip <dig>  and secondarily by pats from other endomembrane compartments such as vacuoles , plays a key role in the polar growth of root hairs. by using the tonoplast-cytoplasm partition of cbl <dig> as an indicator for effective inhibition of palmitoylation, we determined the application regime of 2-bp on root hair growth . 2-bp has been used extensively in yeast and metazoans  <cit>  but rarely in plants  <cit> . treatment with 2-bp resulted in shorter and wider root hairs , suggesting compromised hair elongation and polarity due to inhibited palmitoylation. functional loss of pat <dig> resulted in shorter root hairs but affected width  indicate that pat <dig> functions in hair elongation but not in polarity control. treatment of 2-bp resulted in an additional reduction in hair length in pat10- <dig> , suggesting that other pats are involved in hair elongation. in contrast to pat10- <dig>  in tip1- <dig> neither hair length or width was significantly affected by 2-bp , suggesting that tip <dig> is the primary pats controlling root hair elongation and polarity. however, 2-bp does induce an expansion of root hair initiation zone in tip1- <dig> as in wild type , indicating that other pats also contribute to hair elongation, at least in specific context. indeed, multiple pats are expressed in root hairs  besides tip <dig> and pat <dig> and their diverse subcellular distributions as revealed by a transient expression assay  <cit>  hinted at a complex effect of protein palmitoylation on root hair growth.

root hair growth requires dynamic distribution of polarity proteins, among which rop gtpases  <cit>  are crucial. as their yeast and metazoan counterparts  <cit> , rop gtpases are palmitoylated proteins whose membrane distribution and activities rely on their palmitoylation status  <cit> . we showed that 2-bp causes a significant translocation of rop <dig> from the pm to the cytoplasm , indicating membrane dissociation due to reduced palmitoylation. however, palmitoylation of several rop gtpases was shown to be crucial for their partitioning among membrane microdomains rather than between the pm and the cytoplasm  <cit> . the discrepancy could be due to the specific property of tip-growing root hair cells, in which heterogeneity of the pm is spatially reflected on a much larger scale than in microdomains of non-polar growing cells  <cit> .

as central regulators of polarized cell growth in plants  <cit> , rop gtpases play critical roles in multiple intracellular activities, most importantly, the dynamic polymerization of actin mf  <cit>  that is crucial for maintaining polar growth in root hairs  <cit> . treatment of 2-bp cause substantial fragmentation of actin mf , indicating impaired actin mf polymerization. however, the effect of 2-bp is different from that induced by the actin mf depolymerization drug latb  such that 2-bp results in extensive cross-linking as indicated by strong puncta at the interaction of several short actin bundles . the dissociation of rop gtpases from the pm of root hairs  only partially explains the effect because interfering with rop activities in root hairs by expressing a dominant negative rop <dig>  <cit>  does not result in the dis-organized actin mf network. a more likely scenario is that other palmitoylated proteins than rops may regulate actin mf dynamics in root hairs, as was reported for some receptor kinases during neuronal growth  <cit> .

polar growth of root hairs requires restricted delivery of secretory vesicles  <cit> . raba4s are critical for post-golgi secretion in root hairs  <cit>  by forming an inverted cone-shaped vesicle stream to deliver materials for growth. we showed that 2-bp dissipates the tip-focused distribution pattern of raba4b-positive post-golgi secretory vesicles and caused their aggregation . because post-golgi vesicles rely on dynamic polymerization of actin mf for their motility and possibly for their directionality in root hairs  <cit> , the disrupted actin mf network due to 2-bp  may have indirectly resulted in the impaired secretion .

endocytosis not only retrieves excess materials delivered from exocytosis to maintain cellular homeostasis but also mediates the membrane distribution of key signaling proteins during polar growth  <cit> . as a key signaling molecule, pip <dig> was recently shown to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . by using a fluorescence probe specific for pip <dig>  <cit> , we showed that 2-bp causes a rapid loss of pip <dig> at the pm , which correlates with the complete inhibition of endocytosis by 2-bp pre-treatment . in addition to internalization from the pm, vacuolar trafficking from the tgn/ee is also compromised by 2-bp . rather than proceeding to the tonoplast from the tgn/ee, fm4- <dig> instead traffics to the pm , indicating defective vacuolar trafficking. by using a fluorescence probe specific for pi3p, we showed that 2-bp caused homotypic fusion of pvc/mvbs rather than fusion of pvc/mvbs to vacuoles . the dramatic responses of membrane trafficking to 2-bp suggests that key proteins regulating membrane trafficking in plant cells are controlled by protein palmitoylation. snares are critical components in vesicle trafficking machinery critical for selective vesicle fusion  <cit> . many snares are modified by palmitoylation in yeast and metazoans and such palmitoylation might be evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes a large number of snares  <cit>  that are localized differentially at golgi and post-golgi compartments  <cit> . combining genetic analyses and dynamic subcellular targeting of these snares may reveal important substrates of protein palmitoylation during root hair growth.

CONCLUSIONS
as a reversible post-translational modification that often regulates subcellular targeting and activities of signaling proteins, protein palmitoylation has been demonstrated to be critical for polar growth in metazoans. by using genetic as well as pharmacological approaches, we show here that protein palmitoylation, regulated by protein s-acyl transferases from different endomembrane compartments such as golgi and vacuole, is critical for the polar growth of root hairs in arabidopsis. inhibition of protein palmitoylation by application of 2-bp disturbed key intracellular activities in root hairs, including actin mf polymerization, the asymmetric distribution of pip <dig>  post-golgi secretion, as well as endocytic trafficking. although some of the effects were likely indirect, the cytological data reported here will contribute to a deep understanding of protein palmitoylation during tip growth in plants.
