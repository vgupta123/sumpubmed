BACKGROUND
the genomic region of the major histocompatibility complex  contains multi-gene family members involved in the immune response. the mhc class i and class ii genes encode glycoproteins that transport foreign peptides to the surface of cells for recognition by t cell receptors on lymphocytes, which in turn kill infected cells  <cit> . the mhc class ii molecules have highly polymorphic peptide binding regions  for the α <dig> and β <dig> domains encoded by the class iia and class iib genes, respectively, in various vertebrates including avian  <cit> . these polymorphisms may have been generated by gene conversion and positive selection, such as balancing selection and overdominant selection to adapt to life-environmental pathogens  <cit> .

the most information currently available on the genomic organization of the mhc in birds is for the chicken and quail. the chicken  mhc  region is divided into two major parts, gado-b and gado-y  <cit> . both of these regions are inherited independently of each other, although they are physically linked on micro-chromosome  <dig> ,  <cit> . from previous genomic studies, gga <dig> is suggested to be an essential immunity chromosome, which is composed of genes involved with adaptive immunity , innate immunity  and intrinsic immunity  belongs to the same order  and family  as the chicken. whereas the quail is a migratory bird originating from northern and southern asia, flying only short distances at a time and with a relatively short history of domestication, the chicken is a non-migratory bird originating from southeastern asia and with a thousand year history of domestication. chicken – quail hybrids have been produced by artificial insemination of quails with chicken sperm  <cit> . several immunological traits have been compared between various lines of quail which were selected for high and low igy levels in the serum  <cit> , and for high and low secondary antibody responses to newcastle disease virus  <cit> , influenza virus, sheep erythrocytes and salmonella pullorum  <cit> . the quail is susceptible to marek's disease virus as observed in the chicken. the chicken gado-b complex has a significant influence in the genetics of disease resistance, such as rous sarcoma and marek's disease, but which genes within the complex are responsible and how they confer resistance or susceptibility is not known  <cit> . one important obstacle to elucidating the mhc resistance genes in chicken is that the bf, bl and bg genes have co-evolved as haplotypes with a high linkage disequilibrium between the genes due to the compact structure of its "minimal essential" mhc  <cit> . however, the immune response against the marek's disease tumor-associated surface antigen  in the quail differs significantly from that in the chicken  <cit> . such immunological differences are likely to be due in part to the number and variation in mhc gene loci and/or alleles, but the data concerning the coja haplotypes and their association with disease is largely lacking. from our previous transcription and genomic studies, we found that the quail and chicken mhc regions have a similar overall organization, but differ markedly in that the quail has an expanded number of duplicated genes with  <dig> class i,  <dig> class iib,  <dig> natural killer -like receptor,  <dig> lectin-like receptor and  <dig> bg genes  <cit> . to explain these findings, haplotypic genome comparison among quails and between the quail and the chicken is a matter of primary importance to elucidate the gene organization, molecular mechanism of polymorphism generation and disease analysis.

in order to better understand the genetic factors involved in the generation of mhc diversity in quail, we identified and characterized six cojaiib haplotypes by genotyping and polymorphism analysis using expressed cojaiib sequences. we determined the genomic sequences within the tapasin-brd <dig> genomic segment of five different coja haplotypes including the major transcribed cojaiibs. we also compared the quail mhc class ii genomic structures and diversities of the chicken b <dig> and b <dig> haplotypic orthologs by phylogenetic analysis and duplication modeling. this study shows that the quail has much greater mhc class iib diversity and genomic structural flexibility than the chicken even though the two species are closely related in the evolutionary spectrum.

RESULTS
coja haplotype analysis with polymorphic loci
three polymorphic markers pm <dig>  pm <dig> and pm <dig>   were used to genotype  <dig> randomly selected quails. we chose these three markers for the preliminary classification of coja haplotypes because they are located in the tapasin, coja-dbb <dig> and coja-dmb <dig> loci, respectively . the allele frequencies and heterozygosities for the polymorphic markers are presented in table  <dig>  all of the genotype frequencies were over 13% and the heterozygosity for each marker was over  <dig> . the minimum number of haplotypes predicted from the maximum likelihood analysis of the  <dig> quails by the two different methods, a bayesian statistical method and an expectation-maximization  algorithm, was six . of the six haplotypes, the haplotype numbers . interestingly, ht <dig> and ht <dig> had the same "6–10" and "*02" allele combinations at the pm <dig> and pm <dig> loci respectively, but a different allele type at the pm <dig> locus .

on the basis of finding the different allele type at the pm <dig> locus in ht <dig>  recombination happened at least once in the region within the  <dig>  kb segment between the quail genes coja-dbb <dig> and coja-dmb <dig>  and the newly created haplotype has spread in the population. future analyses using fully pedigreed families should help to ascertain whether the intervening segments of dna are the same in different individuals with the same three-marker genotype. nevertheless, the variability in the quail genomic segment between the coja-dbb <dig> and coja-dmb <dig> genes corresponds to the chicken bf/bl region that displays strong linkage disequilibrium and genomic structural stability  <cit> .

gene loci identification and haplotype reanalysis by rt-pcr, cdna cloning and sequencing of transcribed cojaiib loci
in order to identify and characterize the transcript sequences expressed by the gene loci of the different haplotypes, six quails with relatively high ht frequencies representing haplotypes ht <dig> to ht <dig> were selected for rt-pcr, cdna cloning and sequencing analysis. the transcription intensity of the cojaiib genes was estimated from the number of clones sequenced. a summary of the transcription intensity results for the five haplotypes is presented in table  <dig>  the table shows the transcription intensity for ht <dig> to ht <dig> as a percent frequency of the clones for each individual quail  with the percent frequency of clones per haplotype in parenthesis. the table also shows the gene locus, the detected allele type, the pm <dig> allele, the nucleotide accession number in genbank and the percent nucleotide similarity of the cdna clones to the transcribed sequences expressed by the cojaiib loci of ht <dig> 

in total,  <dig> kinds of cojaiib cdna sequences derived from the rt-pcr products of six quails were identified by sequence comparison . another  <dig> cojaiib sequences were previously reported  <cit> . altogether, these expressed sequences were identified to be expressed either by loci that were previously described alphabetically as coja-dab <dig> to coja-dgb <dig> for ht <dig> or by as yet unnamed loci. the new loci identified in this study were therefore given names, such as cojaii- <dig>  cojaii- <dig>  cojaii- <dig> and cojaii- <dig> as listed in table  <dig>  using the naming formulae "cojaii-xx" as suggested by shimizu et al  <cit>  for the nomenclature of cojaiib sequences. each quail transcribed three to eight kinds of cojaiib gene sequences . five to six of the cdna sequences, which were observed in three quails , perfectly matched with six of the seven cojaiib loci of coja haplotype  <dig> , that is coja-dab <dig> and -dbb <dig> in the major class ii region, and coja-dcb <dig>  -deb <dig>  -dfb <dig> and -dgb <dig> in the minor class ii region  <cit> . however, no sequences were detected in our study for the ht <dig> coja-ddb <dig> locus. in addition, two other cdna sequences were tentatively named coja-dfb1* <dig> in ht <dig> and coja-dgb1* <dig> in ht <dig> because they appear to be additional alleles at the coja-dfb <dig> and -dgb <dig> loci, respectively, as determined from our phylogenetic analysis . the sequences of cojaii- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were perfectly matched to the previously determined cojaii-01hl, -02hl and -04h haplotype sequences , respectively, which were derived from different inbred lines  <cit> . however, the cojaii- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> sequences did not have significantly high nucleotide similarities with the previously determined sequences  of ht <dig> sequences and, therefore, were assigned as belonging to other unique haplotypes .

on the basis of the correlation of the coja haplotypes and distribution of the transcribed cojaiibs for each of the quails, the fifteen cojaiib sequences were classified to five distinct coja haplotypes, namely, ht <dig>  consisting of coja-dab <dig>  -dbb <dig>  -dcb <dig>  -deb <dig>  -dfb <dig> and -dgb <dig> loci; ht <dig>  cojaii-13; ht <dig>  cojaii- <dig> and -17; ht <dig>  cojaii- <dig>  - <dig> and -04; and ht <dig>  coja-dfb <dig> and cojaii- <dig> . from the cdna cloned frequencies per coja haplotype, coja-dab <dig>  -dbb <dig>  cojaii- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  excluding -dab <dig> in quail  <dig>  were the major transcribed cojaiibs with cloned frequencies of  <dig>  ~ 100%, cojaii- <dig> and - <dig> were moderately transcribed cojaiibs with cloned frequencies of  <dig>  ~  <dig> %, and coja-dcb1* <dig>  -deb1* <dig>  -dfb1* <dig>  -dfb1* <dig>  -dgb1* <dig> and -dgb1* <dig> were minor transcribed cojaiibs with cloned frequencies of  <dig>  ~  <dig> % . this result suggests that each coja haplotype has at least one and up to seven transcribed cojaiib loci with one or two of them representing the major locus.

genomic diversity of tapasin-brd <dig> segment
the tapasin-brd <dig> genomic segment contains the major cojaiib region with the coja-dab <dig>  coja-dbb <dig> and the coja-lec <dig> genes flanked by the tapasin and the brd <dig> genes. this segment also has the pm <dig> and pm <dig> markers that we used for haplotyping. in order to study the genomic diversity of the tapasin-brd <dig> segments in different haplotypes by genomic sequencing, two cosmid libraries were constructed representing the haplotypes ht <dig>  ht <dig>  ht <dig> and ht <dig> 

the average insert sizes of cosmid libraries constructed from the genomic dna of quails  <dig>  and  <dig>  were estimated to average  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively, by  <dig> % agarose gel electorophoresis analysis using  <dig> randomly selected cosmids . as the quail has a genome size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp, similar to the chicken, the two cosmid libraries  <dig> and  <dig> were expected to cover  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp , respectively  <cit> . two tapasin  and two brd <dig> positive cosmids  were isolated from hts 2/ <dig> and hts 4/ <dig> cosmid libraries, respectively. dna typing revealed that the cojaiib genes within the cosmids 311ciib- <dig>  311ciib- <dig>  322ciib- <dig> and 322ciib- <dig> corresponded to the haplotypes ht <dig>  ht <dig>  ht <dig> and ht <dig>  respectively. therefore, we selected the cosmids 311ciib- <dig> , 311ciib- <dig>  and 322ciib- <dig>  for the genomic sequencing study of the tapasin-brd <dig> segment.

the genomic sequences derived from 311ciib- <dig>  311ciib- <dig> and 322ciib- <dig> cosmids were determined by the shotgun method. also a part of the tapasin-brd <dig> segment was sequenced from the long-ranged pcr products amplified from the genomic dna of ht <dig> and ht <dig> homozygote quails  <cit> . the genomic structures of the major transcribed mhciib segments within the  <dig> quail haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig> and the chicken haplotype b <dig> derived from the genomic sequencing information and transcript alignments are shown in fig.  <dig>  the dot-matrix analyses between the  <dig> coja haplotypes, chicken and quail, and two chicken haplotypes are shown in additional file  <dig>  after sequencing, the nucleotide lengths of the segment between the tapasin-brd <dig> genes were determined to be  <dig>  bp in ht <dig>   <dig>  bp in ht <dig>   <dig>  bp in ht <dig> and  <dig>  bp in ht <dig>  the sequence of four segments on ht <dig> and ht <dig> was not determined fully however, for dna structural reasons, such as the difficulties encountered with long repeat sequences and extremely high gc contents .

the tapasin-brd <dig> segment showed extremely complicated genome structures among the coja haplotypes examined, similar to the hla-dr region in the human mhc genomic region   <cit> . the tapasin-brd <dig> segment of ht <dig> and ht <dig> contained only one major transcribed cojaiib  and their genomic structures and nucleotide length were similar to the chicken orthologous bl region . the tapasin-brd <dig> segment of ht <dig> contained two major transcribed cojaiibs    <cit> . similarly, the tapasin-brd <dig> segment of the ht <dig> contained two cojaiibs  with major and moderately transcribed cojaiib genes . in ht <dig>  the tapasin-brd <dig> segment contained three cojaiibs, cojaii- <dig>  coja-w <dig> and coja-w <dig>  the cojaii- <dig> is a major transcribed cojaiib, but although both coja-w <dig> and -w <dig> have intact structures their mrna was not obtained from the peripheral blood cells . in all of the major transcribed cojaiibs, the nucleotide length of intron  <dig> was variable whereas the other introns were relatively well conserved . moreover, one major transcribed cojaiib  that was observed in the ht <dig>  was not identified in the tapasin-brd <dig> segment . consequently, the cojaii- <dig> is the only gene that either locates to a minor transcribed cojaiib locus or to some other genomic region.

in summary, the tapasin-brd <dig> segment contains one or two major transcribed cojaiibs that were identified in this study in much the same way as the chicken with its major transcribed mhciib, blb <dig> . in contrast to xenopus and mammals that also have mhciib genes located within the tapasin-brd <dig> segment, the bony fishes, such as medaka, fugu and rainbow trout, have mhci genes within the tapasin-brd <dig> segment. thus, the locations of the major transcribed cojaiibs and blb <dig> are well conserved in birds and more comparable with mammals and reptiles than with bony fish from the point of view of evolution  <cit> .

molecular evolutionary analysis of the chicken and quail mhciib genomic region
in a comparison of the cojaiib gene organization of different haplotypes, the cojaiib genomic units in the tapasin-brd <dig> segment of the ht <dig>  and ht <dig>  were noted to resemble the minor cojaiib genomic dfb1/deb <dig> unit , whereas those of the ht <dig>  resemble the dfb1/deb1/ddb <dig> unit , although they are in the opposite direction to each other . thus, two kinds of successive trans-segmental duplications involving non-mhc genes appear to have produced the major cojaiib segments independently. however, significant nucleotide homologies between the duplicated units were not observed . since comparable segmental duplication variability has not been observed in the gado-b region, the trans-segmental duplications in quail are likely to have occurred after speciation of the quail and chicken from their common ancestor. in the case of human mhc, the traits of segmental duplications and transpositions were observed in the hla class i region  <cit> , and especially the generation of the hla-b and -c segment that is explained by the events involving the mhci, mic, hcgii, hcgiv, hcgix, hcp <dig>   <dig> - <dig> unit in the evolutionary process  <cit> .

to clarify the genetic relationships among the cojaiib sequences and between the quail and the chicken mhciib sequences, a phylogenetic tree of exon  <dig> was constructed . this tree suggests that the cojaiib gene sequences are more closely related to each other in the quail than to the chicken mhciib , and that the cojaiib genes have been duplicated after speciation of quail and chicken. the average genetic distance of the cojaiib sequences  after speciation is twice as long as that of the blb sequences , meaning that the cojaiib genes have a relatively faster evolutionary speed than the blbs . on the other hand, chicken haplotype sequences are more closely related. from the genome sequencing of the red jungle fowl mhc region, the blb nucleotide sequences were perfectly matched with domestic chicken b21*blb <dig> and b21*blb <dig> sequences . therefore, the blb genes appear to have been generated from a recent common ancestor of both the egg-laying domestic chicken and broilers.

in the phylogenetic tree, the quail lineage was divided into three main clusters, one major and two major/minor intermingled clusters, with the coja-dcb1* <dig>  cojaii- <dig> and cojaii- <dig> out-grouped from the three main clusters. in comparison, the chicken lineage was divided into four main clusters, namely one major, two minors and one major/minor intermingled cluster . in the case of the major transcribed cojaiibs, these were observed in all clusters. in addition, the traits for two kinds of segmental duplications were observed in the tapasin-brd <dig> segment as previously mentioned, suggesting that the major transcribed cojaiibs were generated by independent duplications and/or transpositions between the major and minor cojaiib segments at a relatively high evolutionary speed after the separation of the quail and chicken from their common ancestor . in contrast, the blb <dig> sequences of extant chickens appear to have been generated from an ancestral blb <dig> gene with very little structural reorganization or change .

genomic rearrangement elements in the major cojaiib segment involved in the generation of mhc diversity
four types of tandem repeat sequences were identified that possibly drive genomic rearrangement events within the tapasin-brd <dig> segment of ht <dig>  ht <dig>  ht <dig> and ht <dig> . these simple candidate rearrangement elements are tb <dig>  a known t-cell factor motif; tb <dig> and tb <dig>  strs found in the mouse mhc class ii region; and tb <dig>  a recombination motif  <cit> . from the comparison of the repeat numbers of the solitary repeat unit between quail and chicken, the coja haplotypes were found to contain numerous repeat numbers for tb <dig> to tb <dig>  whereas the chicken b <dig> and b <dig> haplotypes were found to have none or only a few repeat numbers . the tb repeats were not identified in the minor transcribed cojaiib segment of the ht <dig> genome contigs  <cit> . therefore, the tb repeats appear to be rearrangement elements within the genome that provide strong driving forces for the generation of new major transcribed cojaiibs via duplications and/or transpositions.

genomic diversity within the major cojaiib region and disease studies
mhc diversity in vertebrates is often attributed to the high snp content in this genomic region. the generation of nucleotide polymorphism of mhc genes is usually explained by positive selection, such as balancing selection and overdominant selection acting on the mhc genes, which is necessary to maintain polymorphisms for survival against infections  <cit> . these selected pressures also lead to a hitch-hiking effect that results in the accumulation of many additional snps around the mhc gene  <cit> . namely, the dna segments affected by hitch-hiking have arisen due to the accumulated effect of overdominant selection and balancing selection. in the hla region, hla-a, -b, -dr/dq and -dp are thought to have been affected by hitch-hiking and associated with several diseases, such as iddm, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris  <cit> . the hitch-hiking effect was also observed in gado-b region . because the cojaiibs have developed at a faster evolutionary speed than the blbs , the cojaiib region is likely to be also effected by hitch-hiking. if a harmful variation is generated around the mhc gene via the hitch-hiking effect, then it is likely to be selected against by genetic recombination.

a serious problem for disease mapping in the gado-b region is that genetic recombination within the bf, bl and bg loci is rarely observed under experimental conditions, therefore, gado-b haplotypes encompassing alleles in all three loci are the units of inheritance most often considered in relating the gado-b complex to immunity and disease responses  <cit> . on the other hand, the quail appears to be relatively more resistant than the chicken to many viral diseases  <cit> . in addition, the quail is thought to play an important role in the evolution of influenza viruses by acting as an intermediate host in which avian influenza viruses can be amplified and transmitted to other animal species  <cit> . since the coja region has the duplication and divergence of cojaiibs , the coja region may be a superior system for the selection of beneficial variations enabling more antigen presentation ability than the gado-b region. therefore, to identify the disease genetic factors associated with the gado-b region, comparative genomic and disease mapping analysis of the coja region is also important.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we characterized the genetic and genomic features of the cojaiib region and obtained the following three main findings. firstly, one to six transcribed cojaiib loci were identified in each coja haplotype, of which one or two of them was the major coding locus. the major cojaiib genes, except for cojaii- <dig> of ht <dig>  were located within the tapasin-brd <dig> segment. in contrast to the quail, the chicken has one major and one minor mhciib. secondly, phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses suggest that the major transcribed cojaiibs were organized by independent trans-segmental duplications involving non-mhc genes and/or transpositions between major and minor cojaiibs. consequently, the cojaiibs have a relatively faster evolutionary speed than the blbs. in contrast to the quail, the chicken blb <dig> alleles have been generated from the ancestral blb <dig> probably since the separation of chickens and quails from their common ancestor. thirdly, four types of genome rearrangement elements  composed of tandem repeats were identified within the  <dig> ~  <dig> kb haplotypic tapasin-brd <dig> segment, and the quail has far more repeat numbers for rearrangement events than the chicken that displays strong linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . taken together, these three main findings support the view that the genomic diversity of the cojaiib region has been generated by duplications and gene transpositions via the candidate rearrangement elements along with a fast evolutionary speed in adapting to environmental conditions and pathogens during the migratory history of the quail after its divergence from the chicken. it is evident from our study that the quail mhciib region has a much more flexible genomic structure than the chicken for generating greater mhc diversity.
