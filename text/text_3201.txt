BACKGROUND
wild plant genetic resources are often used in plant breeding strategies to improve various agronomical traits of cultivated plants. wild plants are continuously evolving to adapt to their changing environmental conditions such as climatic changes, soil quality or pathogens attacks. one consequence of the long evolution of wild species is the diversity observed for some phenotypic characteristics. this diversity is reflected in the genetic variability at the loci controlling the trait. thus, wild species represent a large pool of valuable diversity that is useful for transferring new agriculturally-important traits, such as pathogen resistance, to crop plants.

knowledge of the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions is needed to generate resistant varieties as well as to prevent pathogens from overcoming resistance. in plant-parasite interactions, recognition of pathogen effectors results in the activation of effector triggered immunity , in which case the effector is often referred to as an avirulence  protein  <cit> . intracellular receptors involved in eti are usually encoded by resistance  genes most of which belong to the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein family   <cit> . many plant-pathogen interactions can be explained by the “gene-for-gene” model in which an r gene provides resistance to the pathogen carrying the corresponding avr gene  <cit> . avr proteins can activate r proteins directly or via a cofactor that interacts with the avr protein  <cit> . indirect interactions are often described by the guard  <cit>  or decoy  <cit>  models. these models predict that r proteins act by monitoring the status of effector targets also known as guardees or decoys. in the absence of the r protein, the targeting of the guardee enhances pathogen virulence whereas the decoy has no impact on virulence or pathogen fitness, but simply resembles the actual virulence target of the effector. while such cofactors appear to play a role in the recognition of the avr protein  <cit> , they likely also function in the proper maturation of the r protein  <cit> .

among the identified nb-lrr cofactors, few have been investigated in terms of sequence variability and evolutionary forces shaping their diversity in plant species. the combined analysis of  <dig> r genes and  <dig> downstream genes in arabidopsis <cit>  revealed that although r genes showed hallmarks of balancing selection or partial selective sweeps, most of defence response genes appear to be under purifying selection. the correlation between evolutionary rates and the position at which a gene operates in a pathway has been recently studied using the pto/prf signalling pathway in tomato  <cit> . this pathway involves one nb-lrr gene , two upstream co-factors  and a third co-factor  that is predicted to activate downstream defences in tomato, but is also known for its co-factor function in other signalling pathways like the rpm <dig> pathway in arabidopsis <cit> . although pto showed a clear signature of balancing selection, rin <dig> showed predominantly purifying selection which tend to suppress the apparition of new variants and fen lies between these two genes with signatures of both balancing and purifying selection. more recently, allelic diversity at the locus encoding the rcr <dig> protein, guarded by r protein cf <dig> has been shown to be maintained by balancing selection in the wild tomato species solanum peruvianum. guardee evolution might be governed by a counterbalance between improved activation in the presence of the corresponding pathogen and prevention of auto-immune responses in its absence  <cit> .

rangap proteins were first described as cytoplasmic proteins involved in mitosis and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking  <cit> . the potato rangap <dig> protein has also been described as a co-factor of r proteins, since it physically interacts, through its wpp domain, with two solanum tuberosum resistance proteins called rx and gpa <dig>  <cit> . rx and gpa <dig> confer resistance to pvx and potato cyst nematode globodera pallida, respectively  <cit>  whereas gpa <dig> confers resistance to a limited number of g. pallida populations  <cit> . compared to rx, gpa <dig> induces a much weaker hypersensitive response  when transiently expressed with its effector counterpart  in tobacco  <cit> . unexpectedly, numerous variants of the g. pallida avirulence protein gp-rbp- <dig> are recognized by gpa <dig>  even those from nematode populations described as virulent against s. tuberosum cultivars expressing gpa <dig> <cit> . thus, other proteins involved in the recognition of gp-rbp- <dig> by gpa <dig> may explain these results and rangap <dig> has been thought to mediate recognition of the avirulence protein gp-rbp- <dig> by gpa <dig>  potential for variation in effector recognition due to variation in bait proteins  <cit>  is suggested from studies of the tomato nb-lrr prf, which recognizes avr proteins from pseudomonas syringae through its cofactor, the pto kinase  <cit> . moreover, artificial tethering experiments also suggested that rangap <dig> may facilitate the recognition of avr proteins via the lrr domains of rx and gpa <dig>  <cit> .

in potato, tobacco and arabidopsis, two rangap proteins  have been described. rangap <dig> binds weakly or not at all to rx in planta and is therefore probably not important for the function of rx/gpa <dig>  <cit> . although the exact mechanism of recognition of the avr protein by rx and gpa <dig> is still unclear, previous studies have shown that rangap <dig> is required for rx and gpa <dig> function  <cit> . the genetic diversity of the genes encoding both the avirulence proteins  and the resistance proteins  has been well characterized. a high frequency of polymorphic sites in the four genes has been identified, including key residues necessary for recognition of the cp and gp-rbp- <dig> by rx and gpa <dig>  respectively  <cit> . on the other hand, the genetic diversity or sequence polymorphism of the co-factor rangap <dig> has not yet been reported. to understand the potential role of potato rangap <dig> in the recognition of gp-rbp- <dig> by gpa <dig> and to eventually identify potato rangap <dig> variants able to enhance or enlarge the spectrum of recognition of gpa <dig> towards g. pallida populations, it is necessary to determine the molecular variability and the evolutionary dynamics of this key co-factor.

in this context, the aims of this study were to: i) evaluate the genetic diversity of rangap <dig> in different solanum species and ii) understand how rangap <dig> variability affects the gpa2-mediated immune response. to this end, we explored rangap <dig> variability in  <dig> accessions belonging to  <dig> solanum species, looking for selective pressure hallmarks and key polymorphic positions in rangap <dig>  which could potentially affect either the intensity of the hr or recognition specificity of gp-rbp- <dig> variants by gpa <dig> 

RESULTS
rangap <dig> structure and variability
to amplify the rangap <dig> gene from solanum species we designed primers based on the solanum rangap <dig> sequence originating from s. tuberosum cv desiree . comparison of rangap <dig>  and rangap <dig> gene sequences from the same cultivar  showed that they are only 66% identical while the rangap <dig> sequences from s. tuberosum and nicotiana benthamiana  are 91% identical, indicating strong conservation of rangap <dig> sequences in the solanaceae family. we amplified a total of  <dig> rangap <dig> sequences from  <dig> accessions belonging to  <dig> different solanum species from the section petota. the maximum number of allelic variants obtained for each genotype corresponded to its ploidy level , indicating that rangap <dig> is most likely a single-copy gene in the solanum genome. blast searches against the genbank/embl databases gave best hits with rangap <dig>  and rangap <dig>  , suggesting that, apart from rangap <dig>  rangap <dig> does not have any close homologues in potato. all the rangap <dig> sequences obtained lacked introns and had a cds of 1662 bp , with the exception of one sequence obtained from accession 78s. <dig>  of s. vernei . this particular sequence variant has a nine nucleotide in frame deletion . all sequences encoded for a wpp domain at the 5’end  and  <dig> lrrs , a structure identical to that of the rangap <dig> orthologs sequenced in n. tabacum and arabidopsis thaliana. polymorphism analysis revealed  <dig>  polymorphic sites spread over the entire rangap <dig> sequence:  <dig> singletons and  <dig> parsimony informative sites. among these  <dig> mutations, 47% are non-synonymous . furthermore, 67% and 55% of the singletons and parsimony informative sites, respectively, are non-synonymous. one hundred and thirty three haplotypes were obtained from the  <dig> sequences. haplotypes shared between species: s. tuberosum ssp andigena/s. phureja, s. tuberosum ssp tuberosum/s. vernei and s. vernei/s. spegazzinii . the pi diversity index of most tetraploid species was higher than that of the diploid species. the exception was the cultivated diploid species s. stenotomum, which showed the highest sequence diversity.

phylogenetic analyses
whatever the method used , no clear evidence of phylogenetic structure was observed, as illustrated with the maximum likelihood analysis . thus sequences from species with the genome formulae aa  or aaaa  were not structured according to the species origin. nonetheless sequences derived from the diploid species with the genome formula bb  <cit>  and from the di- and tetraploid species from mexico and the usa tend to group together.

findings from the phylogenetic tree were then confirmed with factorial analysis. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  axis  <dig> and axis  <dig> explained  <dig> % and 11% of the total observed variability, respectively, based on the rangap <dig> dissimilarity matrix. the dataset was divided into the two clades, a and b according to the genome formula, the clade a correspond to the species with the genome aa or aaaa. the lack of structure in “clade a” may result partially from the high variability observed within accessions. analysis of molecular variance  showed that the intra-accession variability explained more than 67% of the total variability; variability observed among species and among geographical origin groups  explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variability, respectively .

the analysis of molecular variance  was carried out considering   <dig> solanum species or  seven geographical origins . in each case, the variance was calculated among the different groups, among the genotypes within each group and within all genotypes. in the amova considering geographical origin,  <dig> sequences with an unknown geographical origin were removed from the dataset.

identification of positions of functional relevance in rangap2
despite the low nucleotide diversity  observed along the solanum rangap <dig> sequence dataset, we previously noted that nearly 50% of the mutations observed correspond to non synonymous mutations. overall,  <dig> positions distributed along the entire protein sequence appear to be affected by non synonymous mutations, however only  <dig> of them appear to affect more than two solanum species and  <dig> out of these  <dig>  are located in either the wpp or lrr domains.

to identify functionally relevant variants among these  <dig> positions, we investigated whether evidence for positive selection pressure could be detected in our data, and carried out evolutionary analyses using either neutrality or dn/ds tests. neutrality tests  were conducted at the intra-specific level in each of the investigated species, while dn/ds tests were conducted at the inter-specific level using slac, fel and paml  methods. values showing an excess of rare variants were obtained for the tajima’d statistic , but none of these neutrality tests provided significant results that allow a clear distinction from neutrality. in dn/ds methods, first using a reduced sequence dataset consisting of only one sequence per solanum species , we compared the four evolutionary models implemented in the codeml program: m <dig> vs m <dig> and m <dig> vs m <dig>  none of the positive selection models appeared to be better adapted than the null model . however, using the total sequence dataset , the positive selection models appear better adapted  and both the m <dig> and m <dig> models founded eight sites with dn/ds values significantly >  <dig> . the polymorphisms at amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> were also identified by the fel and/or slac methods . however, slac and fel also revealed, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> sites significantly  under negative  selection suggesting that rangap <dig> is not a gene evolving under positive selection.

using a dataset comprising both intra- and inter-specific sequences, probabilities of eight sites of rangap <dig> being under positive selection according to the m <dig> and m <dig> models of the codeml program of paml  and the fel  and slac methods , both available through the datamonkey web interface.

it appears from these analyses that only two sites of interest  can be highlighted from the  <dig> sites previously identified. furthermore, positions  <dig> and  <dig> were in linkage disequilibrium   <cit> ). a proline residue at position  <dig> was found to be significantly more frequently associated with a phenylalanine residue at position  <dig> than with a leucine residue  . the amino acid combination p106-f <dig> was identified in  <dig> % of the s. spegazzinii sequences , 25% of the s. stenotomum sequences ,  <dig> % of the s. vernei species ,  <dig> % of the s. gourlayi sequences  and in  <dig> % of the s. tuberosum spp andigena sequences . these five species belong to “clade-a”. despite the lack of structure within “clade-a”, these  <dig> sequences all clustered close to each other  and correspond to  <dig> solanum accessions that all belong to the hawkes series of wild tuberosa or cultivated tuberosa. this probably explains the phylogenetic proximity of these  <dig> sequences with the amino acid combination p106-f <dig> 

theoretical combinations of proline  and serine  at position  <dig> with phenylalaline  and leucine  were calculated using the frequency of each amino acid in the total dataset and assuming that the nature of an amino acid at position  <dig> is not linked to the nature of an amino acid at position  <dig>  these theoretical combinations were compared to the observed combinations in the dataset . linkage disequilibrium between residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> was evaluated using the d’ value, the significance of which was tested with fisher and chi-square tests .

in order to test whether the p/s  <dig> and/or f/l  <dig> polymorphisms affect the function of gpa <dig>  we tested whether rangap <dig> variants harboring different combinations at these two positions might allow gpa <dig> to gain recognition of previously unrecognized versions of gp-rbp- <dig> and/or allow it to work more efficiently. five variants of rangap <dig> were used in our experiments: vrn2-a <dig> , which has a three amino acid deletion; stn1-a <dig> , adg4-a <dig> , adg8-a <dig>  and grl1-a <dig> . each rangap <dig> variant was transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves with gpa <dig> and the rook- <dig>  or rook- <dig>  gp-rbp- <dig> variants. in all cases, a hr was obtained when rook- <dig> was expressed with gpa <dig> together with one of the five rangap <dig> variants . a weak hr was observed when the empty vector  is used most probably due to the endogenous tobacco rangap <dig> that remains. no hr was observed when rook- <dig> was co-expressed with gpa <dig> alone or with gpa <dig> in combination with any of the tested rangap <dig> variants . thus no gain of recognition of rook- <dig> by gpa <dig> was conferred by polymorphisms observed at positions  <dig> and  <dig> or by the three amino-acid deletion in rangap <dig>  when using cp variants of pvx and rx  with the same five rangap <dig> variants similar results were obtained  . thus, natural variation at positions  <dig> and  <dig> also has no effect on rx recognition of the “kr” variant of the pvx cp.

despite the detection by immunoblotting of similar rangap <dig> levels of all variants  it appeared that the intensity of the hr observed with the positive control rook- <dig> varied depending on the rangap <dig> variant expressed. indeed, the hr obtained in transient agrobacterium transformations with variant adg4-a <dig>  and vrn2-a <dig>  was consistently stronger than that obtained with the three other rangap <dig> variants . it thus appeared that the most common amino acid combination s106-l <dig> seemed to be the most effective at triggering the hr, which ensued from the recognition of avirulent gp-rbp- <dig> rook- <dig> 

discussion
rangap2: a conserved gene involved in plant-pathogen interactions
solanum rangap <dig> variants appear to show a high degree of conservation. with the exception of only one of the  <dig> rangap <dig> sequences obtained in this study , all others have the same length  and are characterized by a wpp domain at the 5’end  and ten lrrs of  <dig> amino acids each. their overall structure is also well conserved among the  <dig> accessions of the  <dig> solanum species studied; the two most divergent alleles  are still 97% identical at the nucleotide level.

rangap <dig> shows less sequence size variations and a lower polymorphism rate  than gp-rbp- <dig> <cit> , the gene encoding for the effector recognized by gpa <dig>  furthermore rangap <dig> also appears to be less variable than the housekeeping gene nitrate reductase, whose variability was evaluated in various solanum species  <cit> . the estimated pi value for two s. stoloniferum accessions  and one s. sparsipilum accession  is at least twice as high for the nitrate reductase gene  <cit>  than that estimated in these two species for the rangap <dig> gene .

the phylogenetic tree generated with the  <dig> rangap <dig> sequences correlates well with several phylogenies obtained with neutral markers or using dna sequences of single copy housekeeping and chloroplast genes  <cit> . we can also note that rangap <dig> sequences of the three allo-tetraploid species s. stoloniferum, s. fendleri and s. polytrichon are phylogenetically related. this is consistent with the study of jacobs et al.,  <cit>  which considered these three taxa as a single species. our rangap <dig> dataset also confirms a lack of phylogenetic structure in solanum section petota partly attributed to numerous interspecific hybridizations at both the diploid and polyploid levels  <cit> . this can explain how three pairs of species  have one rangap <dig> haplotype in common.

positive selection hallmarks in rangap <dig> were searched using the tajima’s d statistic. though negative values were mostly obtained for the species investigated, none appear significantly different from neutral expectations. positive values of the tajima’s d statistic were observed in s. cardiophyllum  and its sister derived species s. stoloniferum . it is tempting to speculate that the traces of balancing selection can be linked to the bb genome. however calculation of the values of the tajima’s d statistic was hampered in most of the other species corresponding to the bb genome by the lack of at least four different alleles. we also took advantage of the sequencing of rangap <dig> in multiple species to investigate the evolutionary constraints acting on this gene based on dn/ds ratios. using a reduced dataset made of one consensus sequence per species in order to consider only inter-specific sequences as is recommended  <cit> , rangap <dig> does not appear to be under positive selection and appears rather to be under strong evolutionary constraints as previously suggested by its low diversity and as also confirmed by the numerous  sites under purifying selection identified by both slac and fel analysis. however, using the complete sequence dataset we were able to identify two key positions  that are predicted by at least two different methods to be under positive selection. one possible explanation of this pattern is that alleles displaying these two amino acid changes, also found in linkage disequilibrium, have passed through the different solanum species as an advantageous combination. in a similar way, key residues under positive selection were detected in the translation factor eif4e, which is also involved in resistance to potyviruses in pepper, using a data set comprising both intra- and inter-specific sequences  <cit> . similarly to eif4e, the two key positions identified in rangap <dig> using the whole rangap <dig> dataset could be linked to its role in the incompatible resistance interaction between cp and rx or gp-rbp- <dig> and gpa <dig> 

impact of rangap <dig> polymorphism on plant-parasite interactions
although gp-rbp- <dig> has not been definitively shown to physically interact with rangap <dig>  this protein is thought to play a role in mediating recognition of both pvx cp and gp-rbp- <dig> via the lrrs of rx and gpa <dig>  respectively, as proposed by the bait and switch model and by artificial tethering experiments  <cit> . potential for variation in effector recognition due to variation in bait proteins is suggested from studies of the tomato nb-lrr prf, which recognizes avr proteins from pseudomonas syringae through its cofactor, the pto kinase  <cit> . multiple pto-like proteins are encoded in the tomato genome, and it has been shown that prf recognition specificity is altered depending on which homologue it interacts with  <cit> . as such, variability in rangap <dig> could affect gpa <dig> – rbp <dig> interactions. sites under positive selection are often key positions in resistance interactions and, more specifically, in the recognition of avr proteins  <cit> . we tested if the nine nucleotide deletion in the n-terminus of rangap <dig> and/or the variability observed at sites  <dig> and  <dig> could alter or enhance gpa2-mediated recognition of gp-rbp- <dig> by transient expression in tobacco leaves.

the gp-rbp- <dig> “rook-4” was never recognized by gpa <dig> regardless of which rangap <dig> variants were co-expressed. this is consistent with previous results showing that although different gp-rbp- <dig> variants elicited gpa2-dependent hrs to varying degrees, ultimately, polymorphism at position  <dig> of gp-rbp- <dig>  <cit>  was the only variation which could explain gpa2-mediated recognition of gp-rbp- <dig>  similar results were obtained on the recognition of the cp variant “kr”, which is recognized only very poorly by rx  <cit> . as a weak hr is obtained with the empty vector, these results should be interpreted carefully because in addition to the rangap <dig> variants tested endogenous n. benthamiana rangap <dig> are expressed in the agro-infiltrated leaves and could affect the interaction.

sites under positive selection in the lrr domains of r genes do not always localize to the r/avr interface  <cit> . in addition some amino acids in the lrr domain modulate the resistance by interacting with host factors  <cit> . thus, diversity observed at rangap <dig> sites  <dig> and  <dig>  and the three amino acid deletion  may affect the resistance interaction through a mechanism other than recognition. position  <dig> localizes to the wpp domain, which physically interacts with the cc domain of both rx and gpa <dig> <cit>  which has recently been shown to be sufficient to activate rx fragments upon co-expression  <cit> . diversity at position  <dig> could thus affect the three-dimensional conformation of the entire gpa2/rangap2/gp-rbp- <dig> complex and thus contribute to the initiation of defense mechanisms by facilitating transition from an auto-inhibited to an active form of the nb-lrr protein  <cit> .

our results also resemble those recently obtained in tomato on the decoy rcr <dig> for which the functional assay of several alleles shows that the polymorphisms observed do not play a role in pathogen  recognition but are responsible of the modulation of defence response upon effector recognition  <cit> . however, while rcr <dig> was characterized by balancing selection, rangap <dig> experienced rather purifying selection. this difference in rate of evolution can be related to the difference of either the variation in time and space of the selection pressure exerted by nematodes vs fungus or the ability of these two co-factors to interact physically with pathogen effectors. indeed, rcr <dig> is able to bind to avr <dig> proteins of the fungus  <cit>  and was also showed recently to be able to bind to a nematode effector  <cit>  while it is still unclear if rangap <dig> is able to bind gp-rbp- <dig>  artificial tethering of rangap <dig> and gp-rbp- <dig> through yfp complementation allowed these two proteins to interact physically but did not lead to the recognition of “rook-4” by gpa <dig> <cit> . on the other hand, tethering of rangap <dig> to a gp-rbp- <dig> with a proline residue at position  <dig>  enhances gpa2-mediated hr  <cit> . consequently, it appears that the p/s- <dig> position of gp-rbp- <dig> qualitatively determines whether gpa <dig> will recognize rbp- <dig>  whereas the rangap <dig> positions  <dig> and/or  <dig> and the three amino acid deletion  may enhance the efficiency of this recognition, resulting in a faster and more intense hr.

whether the strength of this recognition is a consequence of only the gpa <dig> + rangap <dig> physical interaction or also that of a rangap <dig> + gp-rbp- <dig> physical interaction remains to be elucidated. however, the observed rate of evolution in rangap <dig> appears to be not in support of a potential physical interaction with so divergent and polymorphic nematode and virus effectors. it seems rather that the different variants of rangap <dig> allow rx or gpa <dig> to function more efficiently independent of the recognition of the pathogen effector. this would predict that the diversity of recognition cofactors represents an additional level of complexity in plant-pathogen interactions that merits further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study sequence variability of the eti cofactor rangap <dig> was investigated for the first time and the potential of variants of this gene to enhance resistance to nematodes or viruses was examined. we identified a three amino-acids deletion and two sites  that should help to define variants of interest. variability observed in theses sites/region of rangap <dig> does not seem to enable recognition of virulent variants of gp-rbp- <dig> by gpa <dig> but appears to enhance the recognition of avirulent variants of gp-rbp- <dig>
