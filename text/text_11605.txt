BACKGROUND
plants have evolved intricate defense mechanisms to thwart attack from devastating fungal pathogens. morphological and structural barriers such as a waxy cuticle and tough cell wall are part of an innate defense mechanism against both living organisms and abiotic forces  <cit> . successfully bypassing these barriers causes activation of a defense response via detection of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns , or effector molecules  <cit> . activation of mamp and pamp pathways are often species-specific and occur through carefully orchestrated signal transduction networks. following a targeted immune response to pamps/mamps, systemic resistance may be conferred through two distinct pathways: systemic acquired resistance  or induced systemic resistance . while isr is activated upon colonization of plant roots by nonpathogenic rhizobacteria and fungi, sar is induced by pathogen attack as well as other elicitors of targeted immune responses . the specificity of the response is mediated by changes in gene expression and crosstalk between pathways . nonpathogenic organisms eliciting systemic resistance in plants boost host defense strategies leading to stronger and quicker reactions to future threats . such “priming” of plant defenses involves short- and long-term cellular changes  <cit> .

plants are exposed to high numbers of nonpathogenic organisms when biocontrol systems are employed. in addition to direct pathogen antibiosis, biocontrol agents  can have the added benefit of priming host defenses . the majority of bacterial species that exhibit these dual roles are isr-inducing pseudomonas spp. or bacillus spp.  <cit> . for example, pseudomonas putida wcs <dig> suppresses soil-borne pathogens through siderophore-mediated competition for iron, but can also induce isr in arabidopsis thaliana via host detection of flagellin, pseudobactin and lipopolysaccharides  <cit> . such microorganisms are good candidates to replace chemical pesticides, and the number of commercially available bcas is steadily increasing  <cit> . in order to successfully implement bcas in the field, a complete understanding of biocontrol system interactions, including their impact on the host plant, is required.


brassica napus  is an economically important crop of global significance. despite attempts to breed cultivars with broad resistance traits, canola remains susceptible to a variety of pathogens. the necrotrophic fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum represents a particularly devastating pathogen to which no immune or highly resistant germplasm has been identified  <cit> . as the causal agent of canola stem rot, this fungus can infect over  <dig> plant species worldwide  <cit> . such a wide host range has resulted in a heavy reliance on chemical pesticides for managing disease. because of unwanted effects on the environment along with consumer safety concerns, biological control has emerged as an attractive alternative for crop protection.


pseudomonas chlororaphis pa <dig> is a bca capable of preventing s. sclerotiorum growth in vitro and in planta in susceptible b. napus cultivars  <cit> . we have previously shown that pa <dig> directly antagonizes s. sclerotiorum through the excretion of antifungal metabolites including phenazines, pyrrolnitrin, proteases and lipases  <cit> , with pyrrolnitrin being the primary compound responsible for antagonism  <cit> . despite our growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pa <dig> antifungal activity, we have yet to understand how the presence of pa <dig> affects the host organism.


in the current study, we examine gene activity genome-wide in leaf tissues of b. napus in response to pa <dig> in the presence and absence of s. sclerotiorum. global rna sequencing  was employed to identify differentially expressed genes indicative of b. napus defense responses. by itself, pa <dig> activated gene networks associated with defense priming. moreover, changes in leaf architecture and increased chlorophyll content were observed in plants treated with pa <dig> alone. the presence of pa <dig> diminished s. sclerotiorum-induced defense pathways, including production of reactive oxygen species  and sar induction. collectively, these findings show that in addition to direct s. sclerotiorum antagonism, pa <dig> exerts a protective effect through host priming of defense networks.

RESULTS
p. chlororaphis pa <dig> reduces s. sclerotiorum infection rates in b. napus
to understand how b. napus responds to pa <dig> and how pa <dig> protects the host plant from s. sclerotiorum infection, we compared infection rates at the 30–50% flowering stage in the presence or absence of pa <dig>  when comparing the rate of infection as the proportion of lesion-forming petals to total petals fallen onto the plant canopy, application of pa <dig> reduced the number of lesions by  <dig> %  and sustained pathogen suppression for at least 7 days post treatment. in this infection model, leaf necrosis was visible under lesion-forming petals at 24 h post s. sclerotiorum infection in plants receiving the pathogen only treatment .fig.  <dig>

global patterns of gene expression in b. napus treated with combinations of pa <dig> and s. sclerotiorum
next, we studied global patterns of gene activity using rna-seq to better understand how b. napus responds to pa <dig> in the presence or absence of s. sclerotiorum. principal component analysis  identified relationships between transcriptomes of plants receiving combinations of pa <dig> and s. sclerotiorum. biological replicates for each treatment grouped together, with pa23-only treatments grouping closely to the water controls . replicates representing treatment with s. sclerotiorum only  or pa23 + ss clustered into distinct groups, with ss clustering farthest from the water control .

an average of  <dig> % of reads mapped to the b. napus cv. darmor genome . unmapped reads from all treatments except ss were composed primarily  of brassicaceae, chloroplast, and mitochondrial sequences . unmapped reads from the ss treatment are derived primarily  from sclerotiniaceae and other fungi. to identify transcripts that may be unique to b. napus cv. westar we performed a transcriptome assembly of unmapped reads . the majority of assembled transcript fragments were identified as b. oleracea and suggest cv. westar may have been recently outcrossed with this species .

because we observed marked differences on the leaf surface when s. sclerotiorum was present with or without pa <dig>  we compared differentially expressed genes  of the treatment versus water control to identify similarities and differences at the rna level. figure 2a shows shared and specifically-upregulated degs in treatment groups compared to the water control. plants treated with s. sclerotiorum alone had the greatest number of specifically-upregulated degs at  <dig> genes. this trend held for both up- and downregulated genes . plants treated with a combination of pa <dig> and s. sclerotiorum had the fewest specifically-upregulated degs at  <dig> genes, a 16-fold reduction compared to the s. sclerotiorum treatment group. the majority of upregulated degs observed in pa23 + ss were shared with the pathogen only  group . while the number of upregulated degs in plants treated with pa <dig> alone was comparatively small ,  <dig> genes were specific to pa <dig> treatment alone . degs of significance from the pa <dig> treated plants are listed in table  <dig>  several markers of systemic acquired response  including pathogenesis-related proteins pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig> , lipid transporter protein dir <dig>  and earli <dig>  are upregulated in the presence of pa <dig>  all degs were specific to b. napus. when the sequence reads were mapped to the s. sclerotiorum genome, b. napus tissues treated with s. sclerotiorum alone showed an appreciable mapping rate compared to water control, pa <dig> treatment or pa23 + ss .fig.  <dig> gene expression changes unique to bacterial or fungal treatments of brassica napus leaves. a venn diagram of b. napus gene counts for uniquely and significantly upregulated genes in treatment groups compared to the water control. b venn diagram of enriched go terms selected from upregulated genes in a

to identify biological processes activated by the different treatments, we used the custom gene ontology  term enrichment function of chipenrich with gene sets identified in fig. 2a  <cit> . figure 2b summarizes go terms of interest from this analysis. a heatmap of relevant enriched go terms for genes downregulated in these groups is available in additional file 5: figure s2b and the complete list of go terms with associated p-values and genes can be found in additional file 6: dataset s <dig>  response to ros  was significantly enriched for all of the treatments. subsets of genes belonging to this category accumulated in pa23 + ss and ss but not in plants treated with pa <dig> alone, while others were upregulated in all three treatment groups. in the latter, response to ros involved upregulation of ferretin  <dig> , ferretin  <dig> , and two homologs of heat shock transcription factor a4a . in pa23 + ss and ss treatment groups, four homologs of ascorbate peroxidase  <dig> , three homologs of ethylene responsive element binding factor  <dig> , two homologs of xanthine dehydrogenase  <dig>  and two additional homologs of heat shock transcription factor a4a  were identified. similarly, all treatment groups were enriched for the sar go term, while the pa23 + ss and ss treatment groups were enriched for respiratory burst involved in defense response.

because reinforcement of the plant cell wall is a marker for priming, it is noteworthy that the pa23 + ss group was uniquely enriched for go terms involving cell wall remodeling  . overrepresented transcripts include lipid transfer proteins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases. furthermore, pa <dig> only and pa23 + ss groups were both enriched for the proteinaceous extracellular matrix go term .

several go terms associated with the chloroplast were overrepresented in pa23-treated plants . specifically, thylakoid , plastid translation  and plastoglobule  were enriched in the pa <dig> only treatment group, and plastid thylakoid membrane  as well as negative regulation of chlorophyll catabolic process  were enriched in both pa <dig> only and pa23 + ss treatment groups. transcripts among these groups included subunits of photosystems i and ii, plastid-specific ribosomal subunits, and two homologs of the negative regulator of chlorophyll degradation stay-green  <dig> .

pa <dig> prevents the accumulation of ros in the leaf
we stained leaf tissues for detection of hydrogen peroxide  and superoxide  radicals to help validate the rna seq dataset. whereas ss-treated leaves retained both stains in the regions directly surrounding lesions, indicative of h2o <dig> and o2
− presence , ros production was greatly reduced when plants were treated with pa <dig> prior to the fungal pathogen . pa23-treated leaves had no regions containing large aggregations of h2o <dig> and o2

dominant patterns of gene expression reveal treatment-specific responses in b. napus
to identify more complex patterns of expression, we clustered gene activity from all treatment groups into dominant patterns  of co-expression using a modified fuzzy k means clustering algorithm. we identified six dps from this analysis . we focused our attention on three dps where genes accumulated specifically in response to one of the treatments . the number of genes clustering in these dps ranged from  <dig> in dp <dig> to  <dig>  in dp <dig>  we identified genes associated with translation, response to fungus, plant-type hypersensitive response, and stomatal closure  when plants were infected with s. sclerotiorum without protection by pa <dig> . the chloroplast go term is also significantly represented in dp <dig> , although no specific chloroplast-related processes were identified. in contrast, pre-treatment with pa <dig>  induced chloroplast-related components and processes, such as the chloroplast envelope, vitamin e biosynthesis, and starch metabolic processes . when plants were treated with pa <dig> alone , genes associated with go terms for cytoskeletal changes and auxin-activated signaling were upregulated , as well as several chloroplast-related terms including plastid translation, thylakoid and chloroplast envelope. some go terms were common to more than one dp; in particular chloroplast  and chloroplast envelope , indicating differential expression of genes within these go terms among treatments . a complete list of genes for each dp is available in additional file 8: dataset s <dig> fig.  <dig> dominant patterns of gene expression in brassica napus treatment groups. a selection of three dominant patterns of gene expression depicting unique upregulation in one treatment group. b heatmap of enriched go terms selected from genes identified in the dominant patterns from 




pa <dig> treatment results in structural and metabolic changes in the b. napus chloroplast
since each dp identified a number of chloroplast component- and process-related go terms, we decided to explore gene expression patterns within this organelle in more detail. the chloroplast go term was significantly represented in more than one dp indicating differential expression of subsets of associated genes. accordingly, we compared relative expression levels of genes belonging to chloroplast-related sub-regional and functional go terms to reveal contrasting expression patterns . for example, a comparison of relative abundance of genes for chlorophyll catabolite transmembrane transport reveals upregulation in the s. sclerotiorum-treated group. although pa23 + ss treatment caused many of the same genes to be expressed, transcript abundance was higher in the absence of pa <dig>  it is possible that the reduced infection load associated with the pa23 + ss group results in decreased transcript abundance. this trend was also observed for the chloroplast inner membrane and chloroplast stroma go terms . genes downregulated in s. sclerotiorum -treated plants were enriched for chloroplast photosystem i & ii go terms as well as thylakoid-related go terms, including genes encoding photosystem i subunits , photosystem ii subunits and regulatory proteins  and other photosynthesis-related proteins . overall upregulation of the chloroplast thylakoid and plastoglobule go terms  in the pa <dig> only group was also confirmed. a complete list of gene names and fold change values for genes in fig. 5a is available in additional file 9: dataset s <dig> fig.  <dig> changes detected in the brassica napus chloroplast in response to combinations of pa <dig> and sclerotinia sclerotiorum. a differential expression of genes associated with chloroplast-related go terms, compared to the water control. only genes with a log <dig> fold change greater than  <dig> in at least one treatment group are shown. i, chlorophyll catabolite transmembrane transport; ii, chloroplast inner membrane; iii, chloroplast photosystem i & ii; iv, chloroplast stroma; v, chloroplast thylakoid; vi, plastoglobule; vii, protein import into chloroplast stroma; viii, thylakoid lumen; ix, thylakoid membrane. b-f transmission electron micrographs of leaf chloroplasts. b water control, 48 h. c pa <dig>  24 h. d pa <dig>  48 h. e pa23 + ss, 24 h. f ss, 48 h. s = starch granule; g = grana stack; m = mitochondria. arrows indicate plastoglobules. scale bar for panels a-e = 500 nm. g chlorophyll b content of treated leaves. h relative abundance of the chlorophyllase  <dig> transcript as determined by rna-seq  and qrt-pcr 




through transmission electron microscopy , pa23-mediated changes in chloroplast membrane structure were identified validating our transcriptional findings . chloroplasts within the uppermost layer of the palisade mesophyll from the water-treated control group contained large starch granules and reduced thylakoid membrane structure. when plants were treated with pa <dig>  the area dedicated to thylakoid structures increased with a concomitant increase in granal stack organization and the accumulation of plastoglobuli  <dig> and 48 h post inoculation . while gene expression in plants treated with pa23 + ss indicated significant upregulation of starch metabolic processes , these chloroplasts were similar in appearance to those of the biocontrol only-treated group containing many grana stacks and plastoglobules . when plants were inoculated with s. sclerotiorum, the area dedicated to thylakoid structures within the chloroplast appeared to be reduced compared to other treatments .

since structural changes were observed in pa23-treated chloroplasts, we sought to determine whether plant chlorophyll was also affected. chlorophyll content between treatment groups showed concentrations of total chlorophyll  significantly increased by  <dig> % when plants were treated with pa <dig>  conversely, plants exposed to pa <dig> and s. sclerotiorum or s. sclerotiorum alone showed no difference in chlorophyll content when compared to the water control . to clarify whether these changes were due to increased chlorophyll production or decreased chlorophyll degradation, we examined expression of genes encoding chlorophyllase. global transcriptional analysis of genes involved in chlorophyll degradation pathways revealed significant downregulation of chlorophyllase  <dig>  in pa23-treated plants, which was confirmed via qrt-pcr . in contrast, s. sclerotiorum-treated plants showed significantly increased levels of clh <dig> and decreased expression of genes associated with multiple chlorophyll-related pathways .

pa <dig> activates unique innate immunity and sar networks to prime plant defenses
to understand how pa <dig> triggers plant priming mechanisms, we compared the differential accumulation of transcripts known to be involved in innate immunity among treatment groups. the interactions of significantly up- or down-regulated genes encoding products known to function in triggered immunity are presented in fig. 6a. treatment-specific expression levels are represented as a heat map for each gene and homolog. many of these genes were upregulated in response to the pathogen, s. sclerotiorum. in response to pa <dig>  two prokaryote-specific surface receptor genes were downregulated, namely fls <dig> , encoding a receptor kinase which binds bacterial flagellin, and lym <dig> , encoding a receptor required for detection of peptidoglycan.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in local and systemic defense responses detected within brassica napus treatment groups. a differentially expressed genes involved in innate immunity mapped to known interactions. expression for each homolog is represented as a heatmap value for each treatment group, from left to right: pa <dig>  pa23 + ss, ss. transcript abundance is measured in log <dig> fold change. orange and blue borders represent receptors which bind to bak <dig> and ios <dig> when activated, respectively. b comparison of transcript abundance of select sar-associated genes as determined by rna-seq. transcript abundance is measured in log <dig> fold change. the leftmost column groups genes by expression pattern




systemic resistance and defense priming are often the result of activation of these innate immunity networks. as such, we investigated downstream responses to discover how pa <dig> primes the host plant on a systemic level. the sar go term was enriched in all treatment groups, including pa <dig> alone . analysis of rna-seq data for genes associated with the sar go term revealed genes upregulated in the pa <dig> only group but downregulated in pa23 + ss and ss groups . subgroup  <dig> contained dir <dig>  cpr <dig> and acp <dig>  suggesting that these genes are involved in pa23-induced sar. we also observed genes induced by s. sclerotiorum only , as well as those showing altered expression in all treatment groups compared to the water control . treatment with s. sclerotiorum alone induced the expression of ald <dig>  glip <dig>  pr <dig> and dox <dig>  the genes mes <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and chi were upregulated in all treatment groups, although expression was higher in plants where s. sclerotiorum was present. the same trend could be observed for the downregulation of cpn60b <dig>  expression levels for several of the genes mentioned above  were confirmed using qrt-pcr .

discussion
many nonpathogenic rhizobacteria are capable of priming plants for an enhanced defense response via induced systemic resistance  or systemic acquired resistance  . however, few of these nonpathogenic microorganisms have been shown to directly antagonize pathogens, especially when applied to the plant phyllosphere  <cit> . in the current study, we provide compelling evidence that in addition to direct antagonism of s. sclerotiorum mitigating disease progression, pa <dig> protects b. napus through priming of host defense systems at the rna level.

the b. napus-s. sclerotiorum pathosystem has recently been transcriptionally profiled under a variety of conditions, providing new insight into genetic processes behind hormone and defense pathway signalling changes that support plant innate resistance  <cit> . patterns of gene expression revealed that sar is weakly activated in plants when treated with the biocontrol agent pa <dig>  the activation of an immune response in pa23-treated plants was reflected in both clustering analysis and in the number of degs among groups . given the majority of degs in the pa23 + ss group were shared with the ss group, we hypothesize that s. sclerotiorum triggers many of the same defense mechanisms in b. napus regardless of pa <dig>  it is important to note, however, that the magnitude of the response is lessened by the presence of the bacteria. this reduction likely results from pa <dig> antibiosis controlling the s. sclerotiorum infection. additionally, pa <dig> may attenuate the host defense response through detection of bacterial effectors leading to priming.

plant cellular signaling cascades which activate defense priming mechanisms are modulated by pamp/mamp-detecting pattern recognition receptors . wu al.  observed differential activation of prrs between resistant and susceptible lines of canola, highlighting the role of prr activation in response to s. sclerotiorum. in plants treated with pa <dig> alone, surface detection of this nonpathogenic bacterium culminates in systemic defense stimulation via sar. genes associated with pamp/mamp- and damp-triggered immunity networks were turned on in response to s. sclerotiorum, but not pa <dig> . the downregulation of fls <dig> in plants treated with pa <dig> alone is consistent with studies showing that fls <dig> is degraded after initial ligand binding to prevent continuous stimulation  <cit> . thus, it is logical to surmise that detection of pa <dig> flagellin by the fls <dig> receptor complex contributes to downstream induced defense processes. a similar mechanism may be responsible for repression of lym <dig>  willmann et al.  <cit>  found that in arabidopsis, infection with virulent p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> lead to strong downregulation of lym <dig>  fls <dig> and to a lesser degree lym <dig>  lym <dig> activity is unchanged in response to pa <dig>  differences in lym <dig> and lym <dig> expression may indicate receptor specificity, as these two proteins are not functionally redundant  <cit> . the role these receptors play in the activation of systemic resistance appears to be variable. for example, flagellin plays an important role in the induction of systemic defense in response to enteric bacteria applied to leaves of arabidopsis  <cit> . in the rhizosphere, purified flagellin from nonpathogenic p. putida wcs <dig> induced isr in arabidopsis but not in bean or tomato  <cit> . moreover, pseudomonas fluorescens ss <dig> induced systemic resistance in arabidopsis fls <dig> mutants suggesting that fls <dig> is not required for priming during this interaction  <cit> . in the future, determining the roles of these receptor complexes in pa23-mediated defense priming should provide additional insight into the molecular underpinnings of this tri-partite system at the plant cell surface.

sar is a classic example of defense priming which is usually associated with localized pathogen attack  <cit> . while genes associated with sar were induced in all treatments, we identified genes specifically upregulated in plants treated with pa <dig> alone. elevated dir <dig>  cpr <dig>  and acp <dig> activity are indicative of sar induction via glycerol-3-phosphate . g3p is one of several inducers of sar, and is also a precursor for the synthesis of membrane and storage lipids  <cit> . the lipid transfer protein, dir <dig>  which is upregulated in pa23-treated plants, leads to g3p accumulation and g3p-induced sar  <cit> . dir <dig> binds to earli <dig>  a paralog of azi <dig> which is required for sar and upregulated in pa23-only treated plants   <cit> . expression patterns of acp <dig> further support this hypothesis, as acp <dig> knockout plants are unable to perceive mobile sar signals  <cit> . acp <dig> also plays a major role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids within the chloroplast, which indirectly increases g3p levels  <cit> . while cpr <dig> is thought to have a role in inducing sar, its exact function has not been defined. notwithstanding, cpr <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate programmed cell death caused by effector-triggered immunity, which supports the hypothesis that pa <dig> promotes plant growth, as it is known that s. sclerotiorum infection results in cell death . taken together, our data support a role for g3p in pa23-mediated defense priming which serves to protect plants from fungal infection.

as a downstream marker of immune responses, ros function as part of a localized hypersensitive-type reaction to invading pathogens, as well as signals for systemic response initiation  <cit> . sclerotinia acutely modifies the redox state of the host at infection sites to promote pathogenesis through production of oxalic acid  <cit> . several ros response genes were identified that are upregulated in either all treatment groups , or in those exclusively treated with s. sclerotiorum , similar to the activation of redox homeostasis genes observed by yang et al.  <cit> . hsfa4a is thought to both regulate plant responses to oxidative stress and function as an antiapoptotic factor  <cit> . upregulation in pa <dig> groups suggests that treatment with bacteria alone can induce the plant oxidative stress response resulting in ros production. this reaction appears to be mild in nature, as only two of the four upregulated hsfa4a homologs accumulated in the pa <dig> treatment group. in addition, hsfa4a-induced ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  was upregulated in s. sclerotiorum-treated plants, and is required for h2o <dig> scavenging and the prevention of protein oxidation during oxidative stress  <cit> . regulation of plant defense through ros in the presence of pa <dig> may operate via the expression of ethylene response factor  <dig>  and xanthine dehydrogenase  <dig> . erf <dig> modulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes to control ros production and xdh <dig> is thought to be a source of o2
− production  <cit> . an important difference between the pa23 + ss and ss groups is upregulation of superoxide dismutase activity in dp <dig>  which suggests enhanced management of o2
− molecules in pa23 + ss . thus, gene expression changes indicate a mild and controlled production of ros in response to pa <dig> alone, while pretreatment with pa <dig> prior to pathogen exposure allows for enhanced management of the oxidative stress response.

to substantiate the changes observed at the rna level, we were interested to see if pa <dig> stimulates ros production and/or modulates ros levels on the leaf surface. in plants treated with pa <dig> alone, ros production involving low levels of h2o <dig> was observed . this is significant as non-toxic levels of h2o <dig> are key to the activation of priming pathways which reinforce resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors  <cit> . large regions staining for both h2o <dig> and o2
− molecules in ss-treated leaves indicates a widespread oxidative stress response which appears to be unregulated. leaves treated with pa23 + ss had not only h2o <dig> but o2
− as well, confirming that s. sclerotiorum induces an oxidative stress response involving both molecules. conversely, o2
− staining was not observed in the pa <dig> only treatment group . collectively, our findings establish that ros production in pa23-only treated leaves is limited to mild oxidative stress and is likely an outcome of weakly induced upstream innate immunity. such findings support a role for ros in the priming of plant basal defenses and initiation of long-distance signaling consistent with downstream pa23-mediated induction of sar genes. in response to s. sclerotiorum, ros production is limited in plants pretreated with pa <dig>  we believe this results from a combination of direct fungal antagonism by pa <dig> and increased capacity to maintain ros homeostasis during oxidative stress.

thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts are a major source of ros because they house the photosynthetic electron transport system  <cit> . oxidative stress observed during s. sclerotiorum infection is likely responsible for damage to the chloroplast and a reduction in photosynthetic activity  <cit> . in ss-treated plants, the observed upregulation of clh <dig> is likely due to chloroplast damage leading to the release of chlorophylls from thylakoid membranes. clh <dig> expression is induced for quick degradation of these photoactive molecules, a process known to be elicited by necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . tem imaging substantiated these findings, as the region containing thylakoid tissue was decreased. in contrast, we observed an increase in relative area dedicated to thylakoid structures in chloroplasts within pa23-treated plants coupled with an increase in total chlorophyll content and repression of clh <dig>  in other studies, bca application has been associated with increased chlorophyll in the plant host . the lack of overexpression of clh <dig> in the pa23-only treatment group is consistent with evidence showing that clh <dig> is only induced after cellular collapse, a defense response not elicited by nonpathogenic organisms  <cit> . moreover, active repression of clh <dig> may be evidence of a yet-to-be-identified role for chlorophyll in defense priming. detection of more plastoglobules in the chloroplasts of pa23-treated plants suggests increased plastid lipid metabolism, potentially facilitating synthesis of lipid signaling molecules and remodeling of thylakoid membranes  <cit> .

such gene expression patterns together with the observed morphological changes in the chloroplasts of pa23-treated leaves correlate to the activation of sar-modulated expression and mitigation of s. sclerotiorum disease progression.

finally, the plant cell wall is an important component of innate immunity and defense priming  <cit> . changes in gene expression related to cell wall architecture were exclusively observed for plants in the pa23 + ss treatment group. go terms associated with cell wall development including thirteen xyloglucan endotransglycosylases which function to build up the cell wall during cell growth  <cit>  and three homologs of lipid transfer protein  <dig>  were enriched. these proteins may be involved in the deposition of cutin or wax in the extracellular matrix, and may increase tolerance to pathogens as has been shown in tobacco  <cit> . as these genes were only upregulated in pa23 + ss, we hypothesize this to be the result of a heightened defense response to s. sclerotiorum primed by pa <dig> pretreatment.

CONCLUSIONS
findings from the current study broaden our understanding of pa23-mediated control of sclerotina stem rot. beyond antibiosis, application of pa <dig> to the plant phyllosphere protects canola through induction of plant innate-immune pathways involving g3p-mediated sar, ros signaling molecules and protection of chloroplast integrity. together, these processes serve to prime the plant and enhance defenses in response to fungal attack. as we move towards more sustainable approaches for crop disease management, it is essential that we fully appreciate the impact that bcas pose on the plants they protect as well as the surrounding environment. findings from the current study are an important step in this direction.
