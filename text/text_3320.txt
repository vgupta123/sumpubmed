BACKGROUND
physic nut  is a perennial plant that belongs to the euphorbiaceae family, and is monoecious with male and female flowers borne on the same plant within the same inflorescence  <cit> . the potential benefit of growing jatropha as a cash crop for biofuel in tropical and sub-tropical countries is now widely recognized  <cit> . jatropha has been propagated as a unique and potential biodiesel plant owing to its multipurpose value, high oil content, adaptability to marginal lands in a variety of agro-climatic conditions, non-competitiveness with food production, and high biomass productivity  <cit> . the oil content of jatropha seeds and the kernels ranges from 30% to 50% and 45% to 60% by weight, respectively. oil from jatropha contains high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and it is therefore suitable as a fuel oil  <cit> . however, the potential of jatropha as a biofuel plant is limited by its low seed production. despite the clear evidence of the abundant biomass generated by jatropha, it is not indicative of high seed productivity  <cit> . there are too many vegetative shoots in jatropha, which could develop into reproductive shoots under suitable conditions. it is therefore imperative to reduce undesired vegetative growth. in addition to these considerations, unreliable and poor flowering are important factors that contribute to low seed productivity in jatropha  <cit> . the flowering locus t  gene plays a crucial role in the transition from vegetative growth to flowering, which is a potent factor integrating the flowering signals. in this context, the function of jcft, an ft homolog in jatropha, was analyzed to improve the understanding of the flowering mechanism in jatropha, which will be critical for the genetic improvement of this species.

the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in plants is regulated by both environmental and endogenous cues  <cit> . the genetic network of flowering has been investigated primarily in the model plant arabidopsis, and five major genetically pathways control flowering initiation: the photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellin, autonomous and age pathways  <cit> . recent advances in transgenic plants and traditional grafting studies have revealed that ft protein acts as a mobile flowering signal, whose ability to induce flowering involves long-distance transport  <cit> . the findings of many studies have helped establish the role of ft as a floral pathway integrator that respond to both environmental and endogenous flowering signals  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, ft is expressed in leaf phloem, and the ft protein subsequently moves to the shoot apex, where it forms a complex with the basic domain/leucine zipper protein fd. this ft/fd heterodimer activates the downstream floral meristem identity gene apetala <dig>   <cit> . ft-like genes have been isolated from many plants, including tomato  <cit> , pumpkin  <cit> , rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , grape  <cit> , apple  <cit> , and potato  <cit> , and the function of most ft genes is conserved  <cit> .

in this study, we cloned and characterized the jatropha ft homolog, jcft. we also analyzed the function of jcft in floral induction using transgenic arabidopsis and jatropha.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of jcft
a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  and rapid-amplification of cdna ends  strategy was used to isolate an ft-like cdna from jatropha. jcft cdna  encoded a 176-amino acid protein with 89%, 83%, 80%, and 78% sequences identity with litchi chinensis lcft  <cit> , citrus unshiu cift  <cit> , rice hd3a  <cit> , and arabidopsis ft  <cit> , respectively. the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the deduced protein were  <dig>  kda and  <dig> , respectively.

the genomic sequence of jcft consisted of four exons, which resembles the genomic structure of other ft genes . a multiple alignment was performed using the jcft sequence and the sequences of ft homologs from other species . the conserved key amino acid residue tyr  found in ft homologs was identified at position  <dig> of the jcft protein . jcft also contained two highly similar sequences to arabidopsis ft in the 14-aa stretch known as “segment b” and in the lyn triad in “segment c”  <cit>  .

a phylogenetic tree was constructed to analyze the phylogenetic relationship between jcft and the fts from other angiosperms . the analysis revealed that the jcft protein  was more closely related to the fts of perennial woody plants such as litchi chinensis, instead of annual herbaceous plants such as arabidopsis.

expression pattern of jcft in jatropha
to assess the expression pattern of jcft in jatropha, we performed a quantitative rt-pcr  analysis using the specific primers listed in table s <dig>  jcft was expressed in all adult plants tissues except young leaves . interestingly, jcft was primarily expressed in the reproductive organs rather than the leaves, where expression of a florigen-encoding gene is expressed .

constitutive overexpression and phloem-specific expression of jcft in arabidopsis induces early flowering and complements the ft- <dig> mutant phenotype
to determine whether jcft is involved in the regulation of flowering time, jcft cdna driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter or the phloem-specific arabidopsis sucrose transporter  <dig>  promoter was transformed into wild-type arabidopsis columbia  and ft- <dig> mutant plants. an empty vector was transformed into wt as a control. transgenic plants were confirmed by rt-pcr analysis of jcft expression . twenty-four and seven independent t <dig> transgenic lines were generated with the 35s::jcft construct in wt and ft- <dig> mutant, respectively. for most of these lines, bolting occurred significantly earlier than in wt and ft- <dig> plants under inductive long-day  conditions .

we selected four independent homozygous lines in the t <dig> generation to examine the phenotypes. the l <dig> and l <dig> lines were created by transforming wt with the 35s::jcft construct, and the c <dig> and c <dig> lines harbored the construct in the ft- <dig> mutant background. lines l <dig> and l <dig> bolted 8– <dig> days earlier and produced 6– <dig> fewer rosette leaves than the wt control under ld conditions, whereas no differences in bolting time were observed when comparing wt and the transgenic lines transformed with the empty vector . under non-inductive short-day  conditions, all transgenic plants flowered much earlier than wt and the ft- <dig> mutant, both of which did not flower until 60 days after sowing in soil . jcft overexpression in arabidopsis did not cause any defects in flower development , but it did significantly reduce vegetative growth time. further analysis indicated that the promotion of flowering in 35s::jcft transgenic arabidopsis was correlated with a significant up-regulation of the flower meristem identity genes ap <dig> and leafy  .

to determine whether ft-like genes are functionally conserved and active in vascular tissue, the phloem-specific promoter suc <dig> has been used to drive the expression of ft-like genes in arabidopsis and other species  <cit> . we obtained ten wt and eight ft- <dig> independent t <dig> transgenic lines harboring the suc2::jcft construct. the s <dig> and s <dig> lines were created by transforming wt with the suc2::jcft construct, and the cs <dig> and cs <dig> lines harbored the construct in the ft- <dig> mutant background. similar to the observations for the 35s::jcft transgenic lines, lines s <dig> and cs <dig> flowered much earlier than wt and ft- <dig>  respectively. lines s <dig> and cs <dig> flowered at approximately the same time and produced as many leaves as wt  or flowered slightly earlier  under ld conditions. similar to the 35s::jcft transgenic lines, all the suc2::jcft transgenic lines flowered earlier than wt and ft- <dig> under sd conditions .

taken together, these findings demonstrated that ectopic expression of jcft in arabidopsis resulted in an early flowering phenotype.

overexpression of jcft in jatropha causes early flowering in vitro
the transgenic analysis in arabidopsis suggested that jcft could be a floral activator in jatropha. to test whether jcft similarly resulted in an early-flowering phenotype in jatropha, we generated transgenic jatropha with the 35s::jcft construct used for arabidopsis transformation. mature jatropha cotyledons were used as explants for transformation, as previously described  <cit> . to our surprise, flower buds initiated directly from the agrobacterium-transformed calli after in vitro culture for seven weeks , whereas the control explants never produced flower buds under the same conditions. the in vitro cultured transgenic jatropha also produced intact inflorescences, but the inflorescences did not produce as many small flowers as wild jatropha in the field . nevertheless, these findings demonstrate that jcft is a powerful inducer of flowering in jatropha.

although flower buds were produced in vitro, most were abortive and wilted several weeks later. a few flower buds developed into flowers , but these flowers also wilted. furthermore, these in vitro flowers were abnormal; for example, the petals of the female flower could not spread . by removing the sepals and petals of female flower, the pistil was made visible . compared with the wild-type female flower , the stigma of transgenic female flower was shorter . an abnormal in vitro hermaphrodite flower of transgenic jatropha  had six stamens with very short filaments  in contrast to the normal male flower , which has ten stamens . consequently, no regenerated transgenic plants harboring 35s::jcft were obtained.

to determine whether jcft overexpression in the transgenic in vitro flowering lines altered the expression of downstream flowering genes, such as suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig> , lfy, and ap <dig> homologs in jatropha  <cit> , qrt-pcr analysis was performed with rna extracted from apex of the 35s::jcft transgenic and wild-type shoots cultured in vitro. as expected, the transcript levels of jclfy, jcap <dig>  and jcap <dig> were significantly up-regulated . jcsoc <dig> was also strongly up-regulated in the transgenic in vitro flowering lines , indicating that it is a target of jcft, which is consistent with the findings that soc <dig> and ap <dig> are activated by the ft–fd complex in arabidopsis  <cit> .

discussion
chailakhyan  <cit>  coined the term “florigen” to refer to the floral stimulus, but exactly what contributes florigen remains unclear. evidence indicating that arabidopsis ft protein acts as a long-distance signal to induce flowering was published half a decade ago  <cit> . subsequent findings have led to the now widely accepted view that ft protein is the mobile flowering signal , or at the very least, a component of it  <cit> . in the present study, we found that jcft encoded an ft homolog in jatropha, and thus represented a potential flowering activator.

ft-like genes have been isolated from many plants. there are two members of the ft-like subclade in arabidopsis  <cit> , five in lombardy poplar  <cit> , ten in soybean  <cit> , three in chrysanthemum  <cit> , thirteen in rice, and fifteen in maize  <cit> . in jatropha, we cloned only one member of the ft-like subclade, and only one ft-like gene was identified in the whole genome sequence data of jatropha  <cit> . many transgenic plants overexpressing ft homologs exhibit an early flowering phenotype  <cit> , suggesting a conserved function of ft homologs in flowering induction in different plant species.

although the leaf is generally expected to be the site where a florigen gene is translated into protein  <cit> , many ft-like genes are abundantly expressed in reproductive organs, such as flowers and immature siliques in arabidopsis  <cit> , flowers and pods in soybean  <cit> , capsules in poplar  <cit> , inflorescence axes in curcuma kwangsiensis  <cit> , and flowers and berries in grapevine  <cit> . in the present study, jcft was mainly expressed in flowers, fruits, and seeds, with the highest expression level in female flowers, suggesting that jcft may be involved in the development of reproductive organs. in fact, ft-like genes in various species play multifaceted roles in plant development in addition to the crucial role of ft homologs in flowering induction  <cit> .

transgenic arabidopsis ectopically expressing the jcft exhibited an early flowering phenotype compared with the control plants . similarly, transgenic jatropha overexpressing jcft flowered in vitro during regeneration , which may have resulted from the up-regulation of flowering gens downstream of jcft . unexpectedly, the transgenic jatropha flower buds that were produced in vitro failed to develop normally into mature flowers. many flower buds were abortive, and only a few developed into abnormal flowers. we supposed that the floral abnormalities and the failure of regeneration of the 35s::jcft transgenic jatropha plants could resulted from the ectopic overexpression of jcft driven by the strong constitutive 35s promoter. consistent with this hypothesis, by using a phloem-specific promoter suc <dig>  we successfully obtained suc2::jcft transgenic jatropha shoots, which were grafted onto rootstocks of wild-type jatropha seedlings. the grafted suc2::jcft transgenic jatropha plants flowered earlier than did wild-type plants, and produced normal flowers . therefore, the production of normal transgenic jatropha overexpressing jcft for use in molecular breeding programs of jatropha will likely require the use of weaker constitutive promoters  <cit> , tissue-specific promoters  <cit> , or inducible promoters  <cit>  to confine the expression of the transgene jcft to shoot meristems at an appropriate level. in addition, a loss of function analysis with a rna interference construct targeted at jcft will be necessary to determine the exact function of jcft in jatropha flowering.

CONCLUSIONS
the ft homolog of the biofuel plant jatropha was isolated and characterized in the present study. jcft is mainly expressed in the reproductive organs, including female flowers, fruits, and seeds. jcft also induced early flowering in transgenic arabidopsis and jatropha, indicating that jcft acts as a flowering promoter in jatropha.
