BACKGROUND
inherited retinal degenerations form a diverse spectrum of blinding disorders in humans and other mammals, including a large number of dog breeds  <cit> . retinal diseases are inherited as monogenic or complex traits. in the last two decades over  <dig> genes that cause retinal diseases have been identified  <cit> .

progressive retinal atrophies  are the most common retinopathies in dogs and constitute a heterogeneous group of phenotypically similar disorders equivalent to retinitis pigmentosa  in man. pra, like rp, is primarily a disease of rod photoreceptors, while cone function and structure degenerate secondarily. pra has been identified and studied in more than  <dig> breeds and distinct loci primarily responsible for each disorder have been identified in at least  <dig> different breeds  <cit> .

the cone dystrophies comprise a phenotypically heterogeneous group of hereditary retinal degenerations characterized by progressive dysfunction of the photopic  system. the presenting signs include day blindness, loss of colour vision, reduced central visual acuity and preserved peripheral vision  <cit> . the cone dystrophies are genetically heterogenous and may be sporadic, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or x-linked recessive  <cit> .

canine cone degeneration is phenotypically similar to human achromatopsia  <cit> . identified genes associated with human achromatopsia are the phototransducin genes gnat <dig>   <cit> , the cnga <dig>   <cit>  and the cngb <dig>   <cit>  genes.

autosomal recessive cone degeneration occurs naturally in alaskan malamute  <cit>  and german shorthaired pointer  and is due to different mutations in cngb <dig>  <cit> . sporadic cases is seen in a number of other breeds  <cit> .

the cone-rod dystrophies  are characterized by a predominant loss of cone function, with relative preservation of rod function  <cit> . the number of genes or loci currently identified for crd in humans is low, compared to those for rp  <cit> . identified genes associated with autosomal recessive inherited crd in man include abca <dig>  <cit>  and rdh <dig>  <cit>  in addition to the mapped loci cord <dig>  <cit>  and cord <dig>  <cit> . abca <dig> and rdh <dig> are genes involved in the retinoid cycle, the cord <dig> and cord <dig> loci are yet to be identified. the standard wire haired dachshund , the miniature long haired dachshund  and the pit bull terrier  are the only dog breeds to date known to be affected by crd  <cit> .

canine abca <dig> has been studied as a candidate gene for cone-rod degeneration in the pit bull terrier, although no mutations were found  <cit> . mutations in the rpgrip <dig> gene have been reported to be a cause of leber congenital amaurosis   <cit> . lca is the earliest and most severe form of all retinal dystrophies responsible for congenital blindness  <cit> . mutations causing residual rpgrip <dig> activity may lead to phenotypes such as rp or crd, which are less severe than lca  <cit> . in  <dig>  hameed et al.   <cit>  showed evidence that some rpgrip <dig> gene mutations are associated with recessive cone-rod dystrophy. recently mellersh et al.   <cit>  found a mutation in canine rpgrip <dig> associated with autosomal recessive crd in miniature longhaired dachshunds.

a high level of genetic heterogeneity of the disease group is observed and a range of mutations in rpgrip <dig>  crx and gucy2d cause different retinal diseases with different modes of inheritance  <cit> .

a resource strain of standard wire haired dachshund displaying day blindness was developed to allow characterization of the phenotype and identification of the causal mutation. electroretinography  and clinical studies showed that secondary degeneration of the rods appeared during the progression of the disease of the dogs of the colony, indicating a progressive cone-rod dystrophy   <cit> . the disease seems to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and diversity in the age of onset and progression of the retinal degeneration within the group of affected dachshunds is observed.

this study was conducted in parallel with clinical studies  <cit>  and genes known to be involved in human cone degeneration, cone dystrophy and cone-rod dystrophy were evaluated as candidate genes for the day blindness in the swhd .

RESULTS
an overview of the studied genes and their location is shown in table  <dig>  studies of segregation of each of the  <dig> candidate loci and clinical disease in informative parents and offspring revealed a number of new candidate gene allele-disease phenotype combinations  in the offspring. the segregation of potential candidate gene alleles was studied in inbred offspring from parents with known disease genotypes. females where either homozygous affected  or carriers . since the father in these litters usually was homozygous affected, the theoretical phenotype of the offspring would depend on which of the two potential alleles  it received from its carrier mother. the most frequently occurring genotype-phenotype combination was counted as the non-recombinants, while any new genotype-phenotype combination, with regard to their parents, was counted as recombinant. each litter was counted as a separate unit and the recombination frequency were summed over all families. a minimum of  <dig> recombinants were identified for each of the  <dig> loci . this excludes all the candidate genes as the cause of mutation causing the disease. the family is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the genotypes of abca4-markers are shown below each individual and show free recombination of abca4-variants between affected and unaffected offspring.

discussion
the large number of retinal genes or loci have been identified and presented at the retnet™ web page  <cit> , facilitates a candidate gene approach in the study of canine retinal diseases. human genes with mutations giving similar phenotypes and inheritance patterns to the one found in the affected swhds were selected as candidate genes. the preliminary clinical diagnoses for the affected swhds suggested that the disease was comparable with human cone degeneration, hence the inclusion of cngb <dig>  cnga <dig> and gnat <dig>  which are associated primarily with cone degeneration. in the initial phase of the study the family material was not sufficient for segregation studies and we therefore sequenced the coding parts of these three genes. no mutations where identified in any of the three genes . continued electrophysiological and clinical studies of the affected dachshunds were conducted in parallel with the genetic studies and revealed secondary continuing degeneration of the rods, indicating a progressive cone-rod dystrophy   <cit> . seven genes reported to be associated with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophies   <cit> , abca <dig>  rdh <dig>  cord <dig>  cord <dig>  rpgrip <dig>  crx and gucy2d were therefore included in the study.

it is important to be aware of the fact that the disease-allele/haplotype present in all dogs in the family arises from inbreeding on one single affected founder . the informative markers were selected at the exact position of the candidate genes, most of them less than approximately  <dig>  mb distance. a distance of  <dig>  mb compares to a genetic distance of ~ <dig>  cm, or  <dig> recombination per  <dig> offspring. the minimum number of detected recombinations in our family  would compare to a recombination frequency/genetic distance of ~ <dig>  cm or a physical distance of ~ <dig>  mb. we would not expect any recombinants if a mutation in any of the candidate genes caused this disease with a simple recessive inheritance. our results show a minimum of  <dig> recombinations  or more than  <dig>  mb distance , excluding all the candidate genes as the site of the mutation causing the disease. however, even though the specific candidate genes can be excluded as the cause of the disease because of the high number of recombinations, the chromosomal regions are not necessarily excluded. the clinical findings defining the diseases as a cone-rod dystrophy rather than cone degeneration also support the exclusion of cngb <dig>  cnga <dig> and gnat <dig>  the candidate loci cord <dig> and cord <dig> are not yet mapped and the genes remain to be identified, but the markers typed for these loci are located within  <dig>  mb of the gene and several recombinations exclude these loci as well.

it might be considered likely that crd in mldh and swdh was caused by the same mutation, since these two breeds have in part the same genetic background. there are, however, obvious differences in the clinical phenotypes of the disease in the two breeds. one of the most characteristic clinical findings in the swdh is pinpoint-sized pupils, observed in 60% of the 8-week old, crd-affected puppies. older crd-affected dogs displayed dilated pupils and delayed pupillary light reflexes  when stimulated with a focal light source  <cit> . this is in contrast to the clinical signs of pbt and mlhd, which include dilated pupils at 7– <dig> weeks of age for pbt and normal plrs at  <dig> weeks of age for mlhd, respectively  <cit> . the differences in clinical signs between the mlhd and the swhd, support the finding of free recombination between rpgrip <dig> and the disease in the swhd. this shows that this disease in the swhds is a unique animal model for cone-rod dystrophy.

the development of animal models of ocular disease represents an invaluable resource for testing and evaluating treatment strategies relevant to both human and canine disease. attempts at restoring vision in dogs and human by gene therapy have been made, providing optimism regarding potential for recovery of functional vision  <cit> . uncovering the genetic basis of the cone-rod dystrophy in the swhd may contribute to finding new gene therapy treatments.

the present work has excluded a number of genes as a cause of crd in the swhd. research in human and animals continuously identifies new genes that may be associated with crd. in addition to continued studies of a few specific candidate genes, future research will focus on a whole genome scan by linkage studies with polymorphic markers  <cit>  or by snp-array typing  <cit> . the development of the canine genotyping array of ~ <dig> snps show that genome-wide association mapping of mendelian traits in dog breeds can be achieved with only ~ <dig> dogs  <cit> . the use of snp array technology, followed by fine mapping based on microsatellites and regional gene studies may be the best method to elucidate which gene is involved in this disease.

CONCLUSIONS
the genes involved in cone degeneration, cngb <dig>  cnga <dig> and gnat <dig>  and the genes involved in cone-rod dystrophy, abca <dig>  rdh <dig>  cord <dig>  cord <dig>  rpgrip <dig>  gucy2d and crx, were all excluded from being involved in the cone-rod dystrophy described in this family of swhd. the study provides a number of genetic markers for use in other studies. further work, based on a whole genome association study will be performed to identify the mutation involved in the disease.
