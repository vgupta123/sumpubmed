BACKGROUND
dss <dig>  is a small , conserved protein that has been implicated in several cellular functions. although it was originally isolated as a candidate gene for the split-hand-split-foot syndrome   <cit> , the connection with the syndrome has not been confirmed  <cit> . instead, it has emerged that dss <dig> is a subunit of the 26s proteasome  <cit> . the proteasome is a multi-protein complex responsible for the degradation of polyubiquitinated target proteins. it consists of a 20s core, responsible for the degradation of proteins inside the core channel, and a 19s regulatory particle, containing about  <dig> proteins arranged into a base and lid structure. the 19s regulatory particle binds ubiquitin-tagged substrates, unfolds the substrates and transfer them into the proteolytic core, but the precise role of many of the subunits is not yet known  <cit> . within the cell, protein degradation must be regulated with precision. emerging data indicates that the number of proteasomes and their subunit composition can vary depending on cellular conditions  <cit> . various proteasome-interacting proteins have been discovered, and post-translational modifications of proteasome subunits may have an effect on proteolytic activity. alternative regulatory particles to 19s exist that possibly function in ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, and the proteasome has also been implicated in tasks separate from protein degradation, e.g. transcription  <cit> .

dss <dig> binds to the 19s regulatory particle both in mammalian cells and in fission and budding yeast  <cit> . this binding is possibly mediated by lid components rpn <dig> and rpn <dig>  with separate binding sites in dss <dig> for both proteins  <cit> . genetic and biochemical data from yeast suggest that dss <dig> is involved in the proteolytic function of the proteasome. accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins occurs in sem <dig> mutants, the dss <dig> homologue in saccharomyces cerevisiae. synergistic interactions are seen between double mutants of sem <dig> and a lid subunit, rpn <dig>  <cit> . in addition to a role in protein degradation, dss <dig> is involved in dna repair. it binds to brca <dig>  a breast cancer susceptibility gene product and a component of the homologous recombination machinery  <cit> . loss of either brca <dig> or dss <dig>  both in mammalian and fungal cells, results in defects in homologous recombination  <cit> . conflicting evidence exists whether the effect of dss <dig> is mediated by regulation of brca <dig> stability  <cit> . it is possible though that the dss <dig> effect on homologous recombination is dependent on its role in the proteasome complex as proteasomes have been shown to bind to double-stranded breaks, sites of homologous recombination, and specifically brca <dig> binds the proteasome lid components rpn <dig> and rpn <dig>  similar to dss <dig>  <cit> . moreover, proteasome activity is required for dna repair. however, dss <dig> does not regulate brca <dig> affinity for the proteasome, as the brca2-rpn <dig> interaction is not dependent on dss <dig>  <cit> . dss <dig> has also been shown to be required for mrna export in fission yeast  <cit> . finally, both sem <dig> overexpression and deletion in s. cerevisiae can suppress exocyst mutations, suggesting that dss <dig> is directly or indirectly involved in protein secretion  <cit> .

sem <dig> in yeast is dispensable at 24°c, the normal growth temperature of yeast, despite the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. however, sem <dig> deleted cells are temperature-sensitive ceasing to grow at elevated temperatures  <cit> . in addition, loss of sem <dig> triggers or enhances a cell differentiation process, pseudohyphal growth, in diploid s. cerevisiae cells  <cit> . in higher eukaryotes, there is currently no in vivo data about the significance of dss <dig>  attempts to identify mutations in the dss <dig> coding region of a selected set of breast cancer patients did not support a direct role for dss <dig> in tumorigenesis  <cit> . here we present the first characterization of dss- <dig> in a multicellular organism, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. we show that dss- <dig> is functionally conserved from fungi to metazoans, and required for oogenesis and intestinal function. in addition, dss- <dig> is important for embryogenesis and larval growth. taken together, the results show, for the first time, that dss- <dig> is essential for the development of metazoan animals.

RESULTS
c. elegans dss- <dig> is expressed throughout development and encodes a nuclear protein
the c. elegans dss- <dig>  encodes a  <dig> aa protein that is 55% similar and 34% identical to the product of the s. cerevisiae sem <dig> gene, and 71% and 46%, respectively, to the human dss <dig> gene product  <cit> . we examined the expression of the dss- <dig> transcript and dss-1::gfp fusion protein in worm tissues. it has previously been shown that human and mouse dss <dig> are expressed ubiquitously in several adult and fetal tissues  <cit> . similarly, the c. elegans dss- <dig> transcript was present throughout larval development and in adult worms . to observe the cellular localisation of dss- <dig>  transgenic worms were generated expressing dss-1::gfp fusion protein from  <dig> kb of dss- <dig> promoter sequence. this fusion protein localised to the intestinal epithelium and to unidentified neuronal cells in the head region . no expression was seen in the gonad, presumably because of germ line silencing of transgene expression. subcellularly the strongest expression was seen in the nucleus with diffuse staining in the cytoplasm . this is similar to the reported dss <dig> localisation in cultured human and yeast cells  <cit> .

dss- <dig> is required for fertility
to study the significance of dss- <dig> we examined the phenotype of dss- <dig> mutant worms. a deletion allele for dss- <dig> was obtained from the national bioresource project, japan. dss- <dig> is a loss-of-function allele with a  <dig> bp deletion completely removing exon  <dig> . the dss- <dig> homozygous worms grew up into adults but produced no offspring . we tested whether the lack of progeny were due to a defect in sperm formation by mating dss- <dig> mutant worms with n <dig> males. no offspring were obtained from mutant worms indicating that wild type sperm cannot rescue the sterility of dss- <dig> . the sterility is not due to compromised gonad development as a two-arm gonad with developing germ cells was present in 98% of mutant worms examined . gonad development was further studied by crossing the mutants to the lag2::gfp marker strain. this marker expresses gfp in the distal tip cells  of the gonad  <cit> . comparable numbers of dss- <dig> homo- and heterozygous worms showed a gfp signal in both distal tip cells . however, the formation of oocytes was defective in the dss- <dig> homozygous worms . only 23% of 3-day-old mutant worms had any oocytes  in contrast to 100% of the heterozygous worms of similar age containing oocytes . the difference was partially due to a delay in oogenesis, as the percentage of mutant worms with oocytes increased to 50% when the worms were examined at  <dig>  days , and to 73% at 4– <dig> days after egg-laying . however, the oocyte formation was abnormal as also in the older mutant worms the number of oocytes was always less than in control worms, with an average of two oocytes per gonad arm . the oocytes were generally smaller and aberrant-looking. occasionally embryo-like multicellular structures were visible in the uterus  . their number per gonad arm was low, and no eggs were laid by the dss- <dig> mutants. sperm were present in the spermatheca of the mutant worms in numbers comparable to the heterozygous control worms /dss- <dig> mutants had sperm versus 94% dss-1/+ in 3-day-old worms). this suggested that spermatogenesis was superficially normal. however, some delay in sperm formation could be witnessed as spermatocytes were still found in 35% of 3-day-old dss- <dig> mutants, but in none of the control worms . in  <dig> -day-old mutants spermatocytes were no longer seen.

the growth rate of the dss- <dig> mutants was examined by counting the progeny of individual dss-1/sc <dig> heterozygotes grown for  <dig> days   mutation was used to balance the dss- <dig> mutation. homozygous sc <dig> worms were identified by the dumpy phenotype). no embryonic or larval lethality was evident. the expected ratios of fertile  and dumpy adults  were observed. the remaining dss-1/dss- <dig> worms were classified as either sterile or young adults indicating that the mutant worms seemed to grow at comparable rates to their heterozygous siblings. when grown at 25°c or 26°c, the results were similar except that the adult mutant worms were smaller than mutants grown at lower temperatures . dss- <dig> homozygotes grown at room temperature were thinner than dss-1/+ heterozygotes, with often a slightly protruding vulva . the lumen of their intestine was generally  expanded  and filled with undigested bacteria giving the worms a somewhat shiny appearance. this was often accompanied by a twisted pharynx . in dss-1/+ heterozygotes the intestinal lumen was also expanded in 36% of the worms examined , but to a much milder degree than in the homozygotes. the lifespan of homozygous dss- <dig> mutants was shorter than that of heterozygous or wild type n <dig> controls . at 25°c the earlier death of the mutants was slightly more pronounced.

the progeny of three individual dss-1/sc <dig> worms were followed for four days. sc <dig> balancer carries the recessive dumpy- <dig> mutation. the results are a representative of three independent experiments.

young adult n <dig> and dss- <dig> homo- and heterozygous worms of equivalent age were placed at either rt or 25°c, and transferred onto fresh places when required. the number of survivors was followed for four days. the results are a representative of two  and three  independent experiments.

dss- <dig> is required for embryogenesis and larval growth
rnai against the dss- <dig> transcript was performed with bacterial feeding by placing n <dig> l <dig> larva onto plates. phenotypes observed in the dss- <dig> rnai f <dig> progeny mimicked the dss- <dig> phenotypes in a temperature-sensitive manner. when rnai was performed at 15°c and 20°c no phenotype was evident. at temperatures between  <dig> °c and 26°c sterile worms were found so that at lower temperatures only a fraction of the dss- <dig> rnai treated worms were sterile , whereas at 26°c no offspring were produced. at the same temperatures, but with vector-treated control rnai, the worms were fertile . similar to the dss- <dig> mutants, oogenesis was defective with only 18%  of the worms having oocytes . very few embryo-like structures were found in the uterus . instead, 32% of the gonads contained abnormal vacuolar structures . dapi staining revealed emo-like cells in the gonad  and uterus. the emo phenotype is caused by endomitotic dna replication resulting in polyploidy, and is identified by strongly dapi positive nuclei. in order to follow gonadal development, rnai was also performed in a lag2::gfp strain. two dtc cells were found in equivalent numbers in both control  and dss- <dig>  rnai worms .

in addition to mimicking the dss- <dig> mutant phenotype, dss- <dig> rnai treated worms had additional phenotypes, most likely due to depletion of the maternal transcript. at 26°c a major portion of the rnai worms showed embryonic lethality and larval arrest . some of the worms arrested at l1/l <dig> stages and some later at l3/l <dig>  5–10% of the worms had deformed epithelia, either in the tail or the head . these worms were usually arrested at l <dig> or l <dig>  those dss- <dig> rnai worms that survived until l <dig> rarely had a deformed head or tail, and no dss- <dig> rnai adult survivors had epithelial defects. similar to the dss- <dig> mutants 40% of the surviving rnai worms had a bloated intestine with undigested bacteria .

dss- <dig> phenotype partially mimics brc- <dig> and kgb- <dig> mutants
as dss <dig> has been shown to bind brca <dig>  <cit>  we wanted to compare the mutant phenotype of the worm brca <dig> homologue brc- <dig> with dss- <dig>  similar to the dss- <dig> mutants the brc- <dig> worms are sterile. however, unlike the dss- <dig> mutants they produce eggs, which, nevertheless, do not develop and are not laid . during diakinesis brc- <dig> mutant oocyte chromosomes do not condense normally but aggregate instead . in dss- <dig> mutants several oocytes have apparently six normally condensing chromosomes , although we found a few with abnormal diakinesis .

we examined wormbase  <cit>  for mutants with similar defects in oogenesis as in dss- <dig> mutants, and looked for proteins that might play a role in similar processes as dss- <dig>  we chose to study the kgb- <dig> mutant for comparison with dss- <dig> mutants for two reasons. first, the kgb- <dig> mutant phenotype has many similarities with the dss- <dig> homozygotes. the mutants are sterile, with no mature oocytes or embryos, and, in older worms, exhibit a protruding vulva and bloated appearance  <cit> . this sterility is temperature-sensitive at 26°c similar to the dss- <dig> rnai phenotype. secondly, kgb- <dig>  a map kinase, is believed to act in proteolytic degradation of an oogenesis-specific protein. it binds glh- <dig>  an rna helicase required for fertility  <cit> , and in kgb- <dig> mutants glh- <dig> protein levels are elevated  <cit> . biochemical evidence indicates that kgb- <dig> regulates glh- <dig> degradation by phosphorylation  <cit> . we postulated that dss- <dig> and kgb- <dig> might both be regulatory factors required for the proteolysis of glh- <dig> and/or other proteins required for oogenesis. kgb- <dig> uteri were generally void of embryos . the gonad arms were disorganized with no well-formed rachis . occasionally the kgb- <dig> proximal gonad contained a mixture of more differentiated oocytes surrounded by less developed germ cells . although the dss- <dig> mutant gonads were in general more organized, upon closer inspection we found some similar mixtures of more mature oocytes surrounded by less mature germ cells . a prominent feature of the kgb- <dig> mutant gonads is the emo phenotype . in younger dss- <dig> mutants no dapi-positive emo cells were visible either in the gonad or the uterus . however, in older dss- <dig> mutants 20% of the gonads had emo-like cells  . in addition, in 71% of the dss- <dig> mutants dapi-positive emo-like structures were found in the uterus, possibly resulting from unfertilised embryos . in kgb- <dig> mutants 95% had emo cells in the gonad , but only 20% in the uterus.

examination of glh- <dig> protein levels by western analysis showed no significant differences in the amount of glh- <dig> between dss- <dig> homozygotes, dss-1/sc <dig> heterozygotes, and n <dig> control worms . this indicates that dss- <dig> is not directly involved in the regulation of glh- <dig> turnover.

proteasomal activity is unaffected by dss- <dig> rnai
most of the proteasome subunits are necessary for development, and their depletion by rnai in c. elegans results in early lethality  <cit> . one exception is rpn- <dig>  a component of the proteasome rp lid structure, which is not required for viability in yeast or c. elegans  <cit> . instead, rpn- <dig> null worms are sterile at 25°c implying similarity to dss- <dig> mutants  <cit> . however, unlike dss- <dig> mutants, the main cause of sterility for rpn- <dig> mutants is the absence of sperm formation, while oocytes seem to form normally .

in yeast rpn <dig> shows synthetic interactions with the sem1/dss <dig> deletion indicating involvement of both proteins in the same cellular process, protein degradation  <cit> . we tested whether similar genetic interactions between dss- <dig> and rpn- <dig> occur in c. elegans. with n <dig> or rrf- <dig> worms no effect was seen when rnai against dss- <dig> was performed at 20°c. similarly no phenotype was obtained either when dss- <dig> rnai was performed at 20°c in an rpn- <dig> background , indicating a lack of a synthetic interaction. the experiment could not be done at higher temperatures due to the temperature-sensitive sterility of rpn- <dig> worms.

to examine whether dss <dig> affects the proteolytic activity of the proteasome, the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome was measured in whole worm extracts of dss- <dig> rnai worms. similar levels of activity were detected in extracts from dss- <dig> rnai or control vector-treated worms. when the chymotrypsin-like activity was assigned as 100%  in extracts from control vector-treated worms, the activity in the dss- <dig> rnai treated samples was  <dig> % +/-  <dig>  and  <dig> % +/-  <dig> , respectively. accordingly, western blot analysis revealed no difference in the levels of proteasome subunits in the dss- <dig> rnai and control vector-treated worms .

c. elegans dss- <dig> can rescue sem <dig> deletion defects in yeast
in order to further study the function of dss- <dig>  we made use of s. cerevisiae cells deleted for the dss- <dig> orthologue sem <dig>  these cells are temperature-sensitive for growth  <cit> , and accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins  <cit> . yeast cells deleted for sem <dig> were transformed with an empty control plasmid or plasmids containing either dss- <dig> or the yeast sem <dig>  transformants were tested for growth at elevated temperatures and for their ability to process polyubiquitinated proteins. the temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by the deletion of sem <dig> was rescued both by the c. elegans dss- <dig> and by sem <dig> . at the same time a partial, but consistent rescue by the c. elegans dss- <dig> of accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was observed in sem <dig> deleted cells . quantification showed that on average reintroduction of sem <dig> to sem1Δ cells rescued 75–80% of the accumulated proteins whereas rescue by dss- <dig> was 50% after  <dig> h of incubation and 20% after  <dig> h . taken together, the growth phenotype and rescue from polyubiquitinated protein accumulation suggest that dss- <dig> protein is functionally conserved.

discussion
our analysis of the loss-of-function phenotype of c. elegans dss- <dig> shows that dss- <dig> is essential for the development of a multicellular animal. in dss- <dig> mutant animals oogenesis is severely affected, and food absorption of the intestinal membrane appears malfunctional. depletion of the dss- <dig> transcript by rnai results in increased embryonic lethality and larval growth arrest, indicating the importance of dss- <dig> also at early stages of nematode development.

dss- <dig> and fertility
the germ line development in dss- <dig> animals was slightly delayed. at three days after egg-laying, control dss- <dig> heterozygotes had both mature oocytes and sperm, whereas dss- <dig> homozygotes still had spermatocytes and relatively few animals had oocytes at all. approximately  <dig> h later sperm had matured in the majority of the mutants, and the proportion of adult worms with oocytes continued to increase. this delay could be intrinsic to the germ line itself. alternatively, the sterility could be a secondary consequence caused by the general sickness of the worms, possibly mediated by the intestine. for example, lipoproteins secreted by the intestine are known to affect germ line development  <cit> . the  <dig> kb dss- <dig> promoter drives expression mainly in the intestine . we attempted to rescue the dss- <dig> mutant with the dss-1::gfp fusion protein expressed under the  <dig> kb promoter but were not successful . since transgenic expression is often silenced in the germ line  <cit>  this suggests though that dss- <dig> expression solely in the intestine is not sufficient for rescuing dss- <dig> oogenesis defects, and that its expression in the germ line may be required for oogenesis.

although oocyte formation seemed to increase with aging of the dss- <dig> mutant worms it remained defective. normal numbers of oocytes were not achieved, and the formed oocytes were not capable of fertilization, even with wild type sperm. c. elegans brc- <dig> is required for proper progression of meiosis, and brc- <dig> mutants have abnormal diakinesis   <cit> . similarly, abnormal chromosome condensation was found occasionally in dss- <dig> mutants. however, abnormal diakinesis does not explain completely the oogenesis defects seen in dss- <dig> mutant worms as in brc- <dig> mutants oocytes progress through fertilization producing embryos that die, something not occurring to the same degree in dss- <dig> mutants. thus, dss- <dig> is likely to have a role in oogenesis independent from its function with brc- <dig> 

kgb- <dig> and dss- <dig> mutants have strongly overlapping phenotypes  <cit>  and figure 4), and both proteins have been linked to the protein degradation machinery. in kgb- <dig> mutants the increased levels of the glh- <dig> rna helicase appear to result in a defective germ line  <cit> . in dss- <dig> mutants glh- <dig> levels were normal suggesting that kgb- <dig> and dss- <dig> are not involved in the same degradation process. it is possible that the oogenesis defects in dss- <dig> mutants might be caused by the aberrant regulation of degradation of another essential protein required for oogenesis, in combination with errors in homologous recombination.

dss- <dig> is essential for growth and survival
rnai against dss- <dig> causes growth defects and embryonic lethality not seen in dss- <dig> mutants. this could be caused by targeting of secondary mrnas, homologous to dss- <dig>  we find this explanation unlikely as no homologous targets have been identified either by wormbase  <cit>  or by our own attempts. an alternative possibility is that the progeny obtained from dss- <dig> rnai treated worms are escapers from the oogenesis defect, and that the embryonic lethality and larval arrest observed are caused indirectly by partially defective oogenesis. however, as the parental generation of rnai treated worms showed no signs of sterility and laid eggs comparably to the control worms , we do think this is a probable option. therefore, we believe that the depletion of the maternal transcript provided by the heterozygous mothers of dss- <dig> mutants results in the early defects seen in the rnai treated worms. this suggests that the dss- <dig> transcript is an essential component of embryogenesis and larval development. it is feasible that these effects are mediated by the involvement of dss- <dig> in proteasome function. the proteasome is required for development, as rnai against the majority of the c. elegans proteasome subunits has a strong, early lethal effect  <cit> .

accumulation of bacteria in the intestine is seen in the dss- <dig> mutants and dss- <dig> rnai treated worms. this could be caused by defective absorption by the intestinal membrane or alternatively, by problems in secretion of digestive enzymes. the fact that the yeast homologue of dss- <dig>  sem <dig>  has also been linked functionally to exocytosis suggests that dss- <dig> participates directly or indirectly in secretion  <cit> .

the dss- <dig> mutant worms have a slightly reduced lifespan. in addition, stress such as heat appears to enhance the phenotypic effects seen in dss- <dig> mutants or rnai worms. this is in line with the role of dss- <dig> in protein degradation since the proteasome function has previously been linked to aging and stress  <cit> .

the cellular function of dss-1
dss <dig> is known to participate in the proteasome complex, and either directly or indirectly via proteolytic activity in brca <dig> function and dna repair  <cit> . in addition, it has been implicated in mrna export and regulation of exocytosis  <cit> . what does the analysis of the loss-of-function phenotype of dss- <dig> in c. elegans tell us of its function in a multicellular organism?

the proteasome is an essential component of the housekeeping machinery inside a cell, and perturbing its function generally results in lethality  <cit> . as such, the significant portion of embryonic lethality and larval growth defects seen in dss- <dig> rnai treated worms are indicative of an essential function. whether this function relates to the proteasome is uncertain. we did not observe an apparent effect on proteasome activity or on the amount of proteasome subunits in whole worm extracts when dss- <dig> was knocked down by rnai. in addition, dss- <dig> homozygous mutants survive into adulthood with only specific defects. the homozygous dss- <dig> mutant embryos are likely to be rescued by expression of the maternal dss- <dig> transcript. the lack of a lethal phenotype in the adult homozygotes can indicate either that dss- <dig> is not required for proteasome activity in adults, or that the requirement of dss- <dig> for proteasome activity is restricted to specific tissues or specific subsets of proteins. indeed, recent work in cultured mammalian cells showed that depletion of dss- <dig> mrna by rnai has a minimal effect on proteolytic activity  <cit> . taken into account that the dss- <dig> depletion in their experiment was not complete, it is possible that in metazoans dss <dig> is not necessary for general proteasome activity. in order to resolve these issues, methods to measure local or substrate-specific proteasome activity in the dss- <dig> mutant worms are required.

the fertility defects seen in the dss- <dig> mutants differed from the defects seen when rpn- <dig>  another proteasome subunit, was mutated  <cit> . either, dss- <dig> and rpn- <dig> have independent tasks in the proteasome complex, or, alternatively, rpn- <dig> acts redundantly with another subunit, thus explaining the mild oogenesis defects seen in rpn- <dig> mutants. indeed, rnai against rpn- <dig> has no effect, whereas combined rnai against rpn- <dig> and rpn- <dig> is lethal  <cit> . we did not observe any synthetic effect between rpn- <dig> and dss- <dig> suggesting that rpn- <dig> and dss- <dig> are not required for the same molecular process.

the function of dss- <dig> has been at least partially conserved during evolution, as we have shown that both the human and nematode homologues can complement the growth and differentiation phenotypes of the yeast sem <dig> mutation . however, the c. elegans dss- <dig> can not fully rescue the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in sem <dig> mutant yeast cells. sem <dig> mutant cells accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins already at the permissive temperature but their growth compared to sem <dig> expressing cells is indistinguishable. it is possible that the homology between dss- <dig> and the yeast sem <dig> protein is only sufficient for partial functionality in proteasome activity, but that even this incomplete activity is enough to sufficiently reduce the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins to allow growth at the restrictive temperature. alternatively, the temperature-sensitive growth defect could result from a proteasome-independent function of sem <dig> that is not conserved between yeast and nematode. we do not think that this function would be related to homologous recombination. first, in yeast no brca <dig> homologue has been identified. second, loss of sem <dig> in s. cerevisiae does not cause increased sensitivity to uv-irradiation or to chemicals that induce double-stranded breaks, or cause significant differences in the capability of these cells to repair gapped plasmids . it is thus likely that the growth complementation in yeast is based on functions of dss- <dig> in processes other than homologous recombination.

CONCLUSIONS
c. elegans dss- <dig> is functionally conserved with its yeast and human homologues. although no direct effect on the proteasome function was observed in the dss- <dig> knockdown worms, the efficient growth rescue and the partial rescue of accumulated polyubiquitinated proteins in yeast suggest that c. elegans dss- <dig> is likely to play a role in proteasome function. it is possible that this role is spatially or temporally restricted. in summary, in contrast to unicellular organisms, dss- <dig> in a multicellular animal is an essential gene, which is required for oogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval growth.
