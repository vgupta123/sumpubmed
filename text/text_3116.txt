BACKGROUND
worldwide, campylobacter is recognized as the major etiologic agent in bacterial human diarrheoal disease  <cit> . poultry, particularly chickens, account for the majority of human infections caused by campylobacter  <cit> : campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the most prevalent species  <cit> . surveys in europe revealed that the prevalence of campylobacter-positive poultry flocks varies from  <dig> to 90%, with the northernmost countries having substantially lower figures than southern european countries  <cit> . in the united states a survey indicated that nearly 90% of flocks were colonized  <cit> . the prevention of campylobacter colonization has proven to be difficult  <cit>  and therefore control of campylobacter in poultry is an especially demanding goal to attain.

campylobacter is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry, where it replicates and colonises rapidly, even from very low inoculums  <cit> . when introduced into a flock, infection spreads rapidly by environmental contamination and coprophagy  <cit> . the problem of campylobacter contamination of poultry is exacerbated following slaughter by cross-contamination from campylobacter-positive to campylobacter-negative carcasses during processing in the abattoir  <cit> , showing that standard biosecurity measures on the processing plant are ineffective  <cit> . even if it were possible to reduce the level of carcass contamination, such measures would be costly, difficult to maintain and restrictive. consequently, another strategy is to operate control measures on the farm and thus significantly reduce colonization with campylobacter prior to slaughter. as yet this has been difficult to achieve: strategies that successfully reduced salmonella in broilers have proved to be only partially effective or totally ineffective in the control of campylobacter colonization. these approaches include the treatment of feed with acid additives  <cit> , vaccination of breeders  <cit>  and competitive exclusion  <cit> .

due to increasing levels of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the european union has phased out the preventative use of antibiotics in food production  <cit> . therefore, there is a pressing need to find alternatives to antibiotics that can be used to reduce the numbers of pathogens in animal products.

bacteriophages are natural predators of bacteria, ubiquitous in the environment, self-limiting and self-replicating in their target bacterial cell  <cit> . their high host-specificity and their capacity to evolve to overcome bacterial resistance  <cit>  make them a promising alternative to antibiotics in animal production. there are several scientific studies on the use of phages to control animal diseases, namely those caused by salmonella and e. coli  <cit> . campylobacter phages have been isolated from several different sources such as sewage, pig and poultry manure, abattoir effluents, broiler chickens and retail poultry  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that they can survive on fresh and frozen retail poultry products  <cit> . moreover they can exhibit a control effect on campylobacter numbers, even in the absence of host growth, which is explained by the fact that some phages adsorb to the surface of the bacteria and just replicate when the metabolic activity of bacterium increases  <cit> . these make them potentially an important biocontrol agent of foodborne diseases.

the present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of a phage cocktail in reducing the levels of colonization by both c. coli and c. jejuni in broiler birds. in order to accomplish this task, experimental models of campylobacter infection were designed and evaluated prior to the in vivo phage experiments. moreover the best method of administering the phage cocktail was determined in order to ensure a high and consistent reduction in campylobacter colonization. a further objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo acquisition of phage resistance.

RESULTS
bacteriophage characterization
the phage cocktail used in the present study was composed of three phages  previously isolated from poultry intestinal contents and selected on the basis of their broad lytic spectra against food and clinical c. coli and c. jejuni strains  <cit> . the three phages showed different and complementary lytic spectra  <cit> . they were morphologically, genetically and physiologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy , pulsed field gel electrophoresis , restriction fragment length polymorphism  and single-step growth experiments. morphologically the three phages have a similar structure and size, each possessing an icosahedral head  and a contractile tail  with tail fibres at the distal end. these morphologies are typical of the myoviridae family of lytic phages  <cit> . electron micrographs are presented in figure  <dig>  pfge and rflp experiments showed each of the three phages to have a genomic dna size of approximately  <dig> kb that was not cut by any of the restriction enzymes tested. single-step growth curves results  showed that the burst size of phage phiccoibb <dig> was  <dig> pfu with a latent period of  <dig>  min; the burst size of phage phiccoibb <dig> was  <dig> pfu with a latent period of  <dig>  min and the burst size of phage phiccoibb <dig> was  <dig> pfu with a latent period of  <dig>  min.

animal experiments
campylobacter colonization models
prior to testing the phage efficacy in vivo it was necessary to determine the optimum dose of campylobacter needed to produce consistent campylobacter levels in faeces. the essential parameters of the infection model were therefore set to mimic natural campylobacter colonisation: the colonisation level to be between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> × 109cfu/g of faeces, the number found in commercial broiler flocks  <cit> , and the birds should be asymptomatic. the c. jejuni 2140cd <dig> numbers presented in figure  <dig> show that the geometric mean colonisation level at three days post-infection  was lower than at subsequent sampling points. the logarithmic mean colonisation levels, excluding 3dpi, were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  × 106cfu/g for the low, medium and high dose groups respectively and the standard error of the mean was approximately  <dig>  cfu/g. the primary reason for the lower mean in the 3dpi sample point was that within each group some of the samples were negative for c. jejuni 2140cd <dig>  which reduced the mean levels: four out of seven birds in the low dose group, one out of seven birds in the medium dose group and three out of seven birds in the high dose group were negative. these negative samples were represented by birds that were not colonized or birds which the campylobacter numbers in faecal samples was inferior to the detection limit . similar experiments were performed to establish the colonization model for the c. coli strain used in this study  and a consistent number of  <dig>  × 106cfu/g bacterial cells was found in the faeces of the birds after 7dpi.

phage cocktail administration
prior to the phage cocktail administration experiments, all birds were screened for phages active against the inoculum campylobacter and proved to be negative.

in a preliminary experiment , the phage cocktail was administrated by oral gavage to one-week old chicks infected with c. jejuni 2140cd <dig>  the faecal samples collected at all sample time points presented campylobacter but did not contain any of the phages administered. this suggested that the phages might have been sensitive to low ph such as occurs during passage through the proventriculus and gizzard. the use of an antacid has been demonstrated to improve the ability of phages to survive low acidity in the digestive system  <cit>  and therefore in the following trials  the phage cocktail was administered with caco <dig> 

in experiments  <dig> and  <dig> the results show that the numbers of campylobacter in the control group were stable throughout the experiments , which shows that the birds were well colonized. moreover the fact that the treated groups and the untreated groups had the same level of campylobacter colonization at the beginning of the experiments ensures that accurate comparisons between these two groups can be made.

in experiment  <dig>  the phage cocktail was administered by oral gavage to one-week old chicks infected with c. jejuni 2140cd <dig>  in order to determine the best phage delivery policy, in experiment  <dig> a comparison was made of administering the phage cocktail by oral gavage and by incorporating it into the chicks' food, using chicks infected with c. coli a <dig> 

for experiments  <dig> and  <dig>  the data show a reduction in the number of campylobacter in the chicks that received the phage cocktail when compared to the chicks from the untreated group  which received only antacid . the log10cfu/g difference between these groups is presented in table  <dig>  after phage administration, the colonization values from the chicks belonging to the treated groups were lower than the values from the chicks that received no treatment . in fact, using one-way anova, it can be said that each value of campylobacter counts from the treated and the control group was statistically significant different  during the experimental period. in experiment  <dig>  at four days post-phage administration  it was already possible to see a reduction of  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/g in the numbers of c. jejuni 2140cd <dig> when comparing the untreated and treated groups. this reduction was consistent through the experiment and at  <dig> dpa it was  <dig>  log10cfu/g. in experiment  <dig> the results show that phage cocktail delivered by food was effective and resulted in a slightly higher reduction  in pathogen numbers than the phage cocktail administered by oral gavage , when compared to the untreated group at the end of the experimental period . however a reduction of  <dig> log <dig> cfu/g in campylobacter numbers in faeces was already observed at  <dig> dpa when the phage cocktail was given by food, while at this time point the reduction was only  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/g in the faecal samples of the group that received the phage cocktail by oral gavage. we believe that this trial was not compromised by the pecking order of the chickens because the birds were observed during the trial in order to assure that all of them had eaten. moreover the low value of the standard error  of the phage titer after two days of treatment demonstrated that there were small variations in the dose of phage that each bird received.

the phage titers from faecal samples of the chicks infected with c. jejuni and c. coli were log <dig>  <dig>  pfu/g and log <dig>  <dig>  pfu/g for experiment  <dig> and experiment  <dig> respectively. these values remained approximately constant throughout the experimental period showing that phages delivered to chicks  were able to replicate and therefore able to reduce the campylobacter populations.

previous studies  <cit>  have used the number of campylobacter in the caecal contents of the birds as a measure of campylobacter colonisation levels in the gi tract of chickens  <cit> . although this may be a representative of colonisation levels, the animals must be killed and dissected to obtain the sample. this can lead to the use of an excessive number of birds when multiple time points are required to evaluate phage levels over the lifetime of the bird. therefore in the present study cloacal swabs were used to determine colonisation levels as they can provide a rough estimate of the numbers of bacteria in the cecum of chickens  <cit> . moreover these samples show the kinetics of colonization as multiple samples can be taken from single birds. another advantage is that it represents the number of campylobacter being released from the bird into the environment and so directly correlates to the capacity of the bird to transmit the bacteria.

in vivo acquisition of phage resistance
in order to evaluate the acquisition of resistance to the phage cocktail in campylobacter jejuni infected and treated birds, a total of  <dig> campylobacter colonies, isolated from each infected bird belonging to the treated group in experiment  <dig>  were checked for their sensitivity to the phage cocktail, before and after phage administration. we observed that before phage treatment, 6% of the isolated colonies were resistant to the phage and at  <dig> dpa 13% of the isolated colonies were phage resistant. although the results from these experiments are not easily interpreted because bacteria that had not been exposed to phage already demonstrated a certain degree of phage resistance, the key conclusion is that the resistant phenotype could have been selected for during therapy. if that was the case, then the resistant phenotype would soon become the dominant phenotype after therapy began. this may be connected to previous observations that resistant bacteria lose fitness and are out-competed by the non-resistant phenotype in the intestines, despite being sensitive to the phage that is present  <cit> . to test this hypothesis seven groups of  <dig> birds were inoculated with phage-sensitive and phage-resistant campylobacter strains re-isolated from birds used in the previous trial. the numbers of campylobacter in faeces from each bird was enumerated at seven days post-inoculation . there was no significant difference between any of the groups . this suggests that the resistant phenotype was not hindering the ability of the campylobacter to colonise the chickens. however it may have been the case that in vivo the resistant phenotype was rapidly lost so no lack of fitness was evident. in order to test this hypothesis we randomly selected three campylobacter colonies from faecal samples from each infected chicken of each of the groups and determined their sensitivity to the phage cocktail . interestingly,  <dig> % of the colonies isolated from chickens infected with resistant strains isolated before phage treatment lost their resistant phenotype and 54% of the resistant strains isolated in phage treated chickens reverted their resistant phenotype to a sensitive one. these results are not in accordance with loc carrillo et al.  <cit>  in which 97% of resistant phenotype reverted back to phage sensitive strains.

discussion
the characterization of the three campylobacter phages that compose the cocktail is in accordance with the majority of campylobacter phages reported in the literature  <cit> . the only restriction enzyme that has been used successfully to digest the dna of some campylobacter phages is hhai, but even this enzyme did not yield results for the phages used in the present study. possible explanations for these results include: the phage genomes may have lost restriction sites due to selective pressures from restriction modification systems; the phage genomes may have encoded nucleotide-modifying enzymes such as methyltransferases that would have modified the bases at the restriction sites; the phage genomes may contain unusual bases. further studies such as phage genome sequencing would be needed in order to understand the refractory nature of the dna of the campylobacter phages.

to our knowledge there is just one report in the literature where the burst size and latent period parameters were calculated for campylobacter phages, i.e.  <dig>  virions per cell and  <dig>  h respectively  <cit> . the phages phiccoibb <dig>  phiccoibb <dig> and phiccoibb <dig> that were used in the present study have smaller latent periods  and higher burst sizes  respectively.

in order to evaluate the efficacy of the three phages in the in vivo trials, it was necessary to recreate experimentally campylobacter colonization in chicks. the model used revealed a successful colonisation; no birds in any of the groups showed any overt symptoms of disease, colonisation or stress even at the highest dose of campylobacter administered. this asymptomatic carriage mimics campylobacter colonisation in commercial flocks. the dose of campylobacter appeared to have little effect on the outcome of subsequent colonisation levels. the logarithmic mean level of colonisation of the three groups was  <dig>  × 106cfu/g, which is within the range of the infection levels found in commercial broiler flocks:  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> × 109cfu/g  <cit>  and hence is an appropriate level for the experimental model. the data shows that campylobacter had not consistently colonised all the birds by 3dpi. although the reasons for campylobacter colonization failure of young birds are still unclear, these negative colonized chickens may have maternal antibodies which protects them from campylobacter colonization  <cit> . in all subsequent time points all birds were colonised. this suggests that if a trial is to evaluate the reduction of campylobacter levels from colonised birds, it is essential to allow time for campylobacter to become established in the gut of the chicks before phage treatment is initiated. therefore, in the present study phage treatment was performed after seven days post-infection.

the results of the in vivo trials show that the phage cocktail was able to reduce the number of c. jejuni  and c. coli  colonisation in chickens, by approximately  <dig> log <dig> cfu/g. moreover this reduction persisted throughout the experimental period. other studies  <cit>  produced a similar reduction of campylobacter counts at the end of the experimental period. however that reduction was of transient nature in comparison to our study, where a sustained reduction in campylobacter numbers was obtained during the seven days trial. a phage therapy that produces this kind of reduction of a pathogen would probably allow the phage administration to the birds at any point in the production cycle. the advantages of giving the phage early in production would be that environmental contamination would be minimised and that only a proportion of the flock would need treating as the phage would be spread naturally in the environment to all birds. however this strategy does carry a risk of resistance emerging and reducing the efficacy of treatment. in fact, campylobacter strains resistant to phage infection were recovered from phage-treated chickens at a frequency of 13%. however resistance to the phage cocktail was found in campylobacter in chickens before phage therapy, which means that bacteria can naturally acquire phage resistance. nevertheless, following phage treatment an increase in the resistant population was observed meaning that phages might have selected for resistant strains. in our results and conversely to results described by loc carrillo et al.  <cit>  the resistant phenotype did not lose the ability to colonise the chicken gut and did not completely revert to sensitive type. this can be pointed out as a major drawback of phage therapy. so, in order to overcome this problem the best strategy of phage administration is a short time before slaughter. additionally, it is recommended that when selecting the phages that will compose the cocktail an additional criterion should be the ability to infect other phage resistant campylobacter phenotypes.

in the present study, two phage administration strategies were assessed: oral gavage and food incorporation. oral gavage permitted the delivery of accurate doses directly to the gastro-intestinal  tract of individual birds. however if phage therapy is to be utilised by the poultry industry then the phage product must be simple and cheap to administer to flocks consisting of several thousand birds. we demonstrated that application of phage therapy can be successfully achieved in food leading to a reduction similar to that achieved by oral gavage. moreover this reduction was earlier in comparison to the group that received the phage cocktail by oral gavage which can be explained by the protective effect of food that hampers the low ph from inactivating the phages  <cit> . these results are of extreme importance as this route of phage administration can provide a viable strategy for delivery of phage in a commercial context. phages could also be given in the drinking water, however preliminary experiments showed that phage needed to be administrated with antacid and this could prove more difficult to deliver with the water than as an inclusion in the feed.

moreover, in our study the phage cocktail was administered as a single dose to campylobacter-infected chicks 7dpi. a single dose of phage is, in comparison to multiple doses  <cit> , an easier and more feasible strategy in a farm situation.

it must be noted that the present model does not comprise all the variables that can play a role in the use of phages to control campylobacter in poultry. firstly, this model considers the use of phages as a therapy and not as a prophylactic measure. secondly, in the present work birds were challenged with campylobacter at one-year-old, but in a real commercial context birds just get colonized with campylobacter after two weeks of age. however, these conditions were not tested in our experiments as it is very difficult to maintain chicks free of pathogens. an additional limitation of the model was the limited time course of the experiments . nevertheless, the model described herein is a proof of principle that campylobacter phages given orally or administered in feed can effectively reduce the campylobacter colonization levels. further studies need to be undertaken in order to test phage effectiveness in older chickens, their use as prophylactic agents and longer time course trials in order to reflect the production cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
the phage cocktail was able to reduce c. coli and c. jejuni in infected poultry by approximately  <dig> log10cfu/g, which is of great importance as they are the most prevalent campylobacter species found in positive campylobacter flocks. moreover mathematical models indicate that a  <dig> log10cfu/g reduction of campylobacter on the chicken carcasses could lead to a 30-fold reduction in the incidence of campylobacteriosis associated with consumption of chicken meals  <cit> . the phage cocktail administered in feed led to an earlier reduction in campylobacter titre than when given by oral gavage and thus this method can be easily and successfully used under commercial condition in a poultry unit. another important aspect of the present study is that as the phages that composed the cocktail were isolated from poultry carcasses, their use to reduce campylobacter colonisation in the live birds would not introduce any new biological entity into the food chain.
