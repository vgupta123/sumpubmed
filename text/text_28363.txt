BACKGROUND
lafora disease  is a rare fatal type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy that initially manifests during adolescence. recessive mutations in two main loci, epm2a or epm2b, are known to produce ld . the epm2a gene encodes the dual-specificity phosphatase laforin and the epm2b gene encodes the e3-ubiquitin ligase malin. although it is known that both proteins form a functional complex , the underlying molecular mechanisms of this pathology are still far from being understood. for this reason the search for substrates of the laforin/malin complex has been a good strategy to understand the molecular basis of this pathology. different techniques have been used with this aim, from regular yeast two-hybrid screening, using either laforin or malin as bait, to co-immunoprecipitation/pull down analyses and functional interactions. all these approaches have identified several putative substrates of the laforin/malin complex that have enriched our knowledge on the different cellular pathways where laforin and malin may participate .

in order to identify novel phospho-protein substrates of laforin, we have used the yeast substrate-trapping system described by fukada and noda  <cit> , designed to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatases. this technique is based on the use of phosphatase mutants which harbor a substitution in invariant amino acid residues in the catalytic domain, making them catalytically inactive, but retaining the capability to recognize the phosphorylated substrate. in addition, the yeast model co-expresses a wide spectrum tyrosine kinase , which will phosphorylate putative target substrates. in this way, the possibilities to identify putative phospho-tyrosine containing substrates of a particular phosphatase are enhanced. here, we have identified the two muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase  as novel interaction partners of laforin. pyruvate kinase regulates the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis, which catalyzes the transfer of a high-energy phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate  to adenine diphosphate , yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate  . four isoforms of pyruvate kinase have been described in mammals: pkr, present mainly in erythrocytes; pkl, present in liver, kidney, small intestine and pancreas; pkm <dig>  present in muscle, heart and brain; and pkm <dig>  widely distributed and also present in fetal tissues and cancer cells . pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> result from an alternative splicing of two mutually exclusive exons of the pkm gene . this difference in exon usage results in proteins that differ only in  <dig> amino acids distributed along a small region of  <dig> amino acids . these changes confer distinct kinetic and regulatory properties to pkm <dig> and pkm2: although both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> are proteins of  <dig> aa, with a similar molecular weight  and similar structural domains  , only pkm <dig> is fully active whereas pkm <dig> may form inactive dimeric complexes .fig.  <dig> pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> interact with laforin. a yeast substrate-trapping system with lexa-laforin c266s was used to identify putative partners from a human brain library. five clones corresponding to different lengths of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> were selected . a diagram of the different domains in pkms is presented . the strength of the interaction of these clones with either lexa-laforin c266s or lexa-laforin wild type was measured . b co-immunoprecipitation analysis of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> with laforin. hek <dig> cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. crude extracts and co-immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-flag antibody was performed as indicated in methods. proteins in the immunoprecipitates and in the crude extracts  were analyzed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies



in this work we present evidence of the interaction between laforin and both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig>  as a result of this interaction, we show that the laforin/malin complex ubiquitinates pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> and that this post-translational modification, although it does not affect the catalytic activity of pkm <dig>  it impairs the nuclear localization of pkm <dig> 

RESULTS
the muscular isoform of pyruvate kinase  interacts with laforin
as indicated at the background section, in this work we have used the yeast substrate-trapping system  <cit> , designed to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to screen for possible phospho-protein substrates of laforin. following the conditions required for this type of screening, we initially constructed a catalytically inactive laforin mutant, laf-c266s, which affects the key cys residue in the catalytic site  <cit> . this mutant retained the capability to recognize laforin binding partners  . a yeast strain co-expressing lexa-laforin c266s and the protein tyrosine kinase v-src was transformed with a human brain cdna library, and after screening more than  <dig>  independent transformants, we recovered  <dig> putative positive clones. unfortunately,  <dig> of them were false positives since when we purified the corresponding plasmids they were not able to reproduce the two-hybrid interaction. among the other  <dig> positive clones, we identified already known laforin binding partners, such as laforin itself and r5/ptg, what validated the technique . the rest of the clones interacted with laforin with different strength . among them, we focused our attention to those that coded for the two muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase , as we recovered five pkm-related clones which encoded for different fragments of both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> . in these clones the interaction with laforin was much stronger when only the c-terminal part of pkms was present in the clones , and decreased when larger parts of the protein were present in the clones  . we repeated the two-hybrid interaction of these clones using lexa-laforin wt as bait and found that the interaction was maintained although at lower intensity . we also noticed that all these interactions were maintained under growth conditions that prevented the expression of v-src, indicating that, contrary to the experimental design, they were not dependent on the phosphorylation of the substrate by this protein kinase.table  <dig> positive clones identified in substrate-trap screening of a human brain cdna library using lexa-laforin c266s as bait. yeast thy-ap <dig> cells transformed with plasmid pbridge-laforin c266s were co-transformed with a human brain cdna library in pact2

positive clones were confirmed, subjected to blast analysis and protein interaction estimated by β-galactosidase filter lift assays 



in order to confirm the interaction between laforin and the pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> isoforms, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation analysis in mammalian cells. first, we obtained by pcr the full length cdnas of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> from the human brain cdna library and subcloned them into plasmid pcmv-myc, to allow their expression in mammalian hek <dig> cells. we observed that the expression of the pkm <dig> isoform yielded a protein with a slightly faster mobility in sds-page, probably due to differences in protein sequence in comparison to pkm <dig> . we co-expressed in hek <dig> cells the pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> isoforms and laforin  either wild type or c266s, immunoprecipitated the crude extracts with anti-flag antibody and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by western blotting using anti-flag and anti-myc antibodies. as shown in fig. 1b  both laforin-wt and laforin-c266s were able to co-immunoprecipitate both myc-pkm <dig> and myc-pkm <dig> isoforms. taken together, these results indicate that laforin interacts with both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig>  and that the phosphatase activity of laforin is dispensable for the interaction with the pkms isoforms. we tried to repeat the co-immunoprecipitation experiment with endogenous levels of proteins but unfortunately we did not find any reliable commercial antibody which recognized endogenous levels of laforin.

the laforin/malin complex polyubiquitinates pkm isoforms, attaching k63-linked ubiquitins
it is known that laforin forms a functional complex with the e3-ubiquitin ligase malin, in which laforin recognizes the substrates that are eventually ubiquitinated by malin. in order to check if the interaction between pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> and laforin resulted in the ubiquitination of the pkm isoforms, we co-expressed in hek <dig> cells myc-pkm <dig> or myc-pkm <dig>  laforin, malin and a 6xhis-tagged ubiquitin. the 6xhis tag present in the ubiquitin allows the recovery of polyubiquitinated forms by metal affinity chromatography in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride, an inhibitor of the action of deubiquitinases  <cit> . as shown in fig. 2a, the laforin/malin complex was able to promote the polyubiquitination of pkm <dig> . this modification was dependent on the presence of the laforin/malin complex, since it was drastically reduced in its absence  or when only laforin or malin were expressed in the cells . similar results were obtained when pkm <dig> was assayed in the same way . this ubiquitination was specific of the laforin/malin complex since we did not observe this modification when we co-expressed mdm <dig>  an unrelated e3-ubiquitin ligase .fig.  <dig> the laforin/malin complex polyubiquitinates pkm isoforms attaching k63-linked ubiquitins. a and b hek <dig> cells expressing the indicated plasmids were analyzed for in vivo ubiquitination as indicated in methods. proteins bound to the metal affinity column  and those present in the crude extracts  were analyzed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. the position of polyubiquitinated proteins is indicated. the fuzzy bands in the ce are probably due to the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochoride in the extracts



in order to analyze the topology of the laforin/malin-induced polyubiquitinated chains in pkms, we co-expressed in hek <dig> cells mutated forms of ubiquitin that prevented the formation of ubiquitin chains in either k <dig>  or k <dig>  . as shown in fig. 2b, in the presence of k48r-ubiquitin, a similar pattern of polyubiquitination of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> by the laforin/malin complex was obtained , whereas in the presence of k63r-ubiquitin, no polyubiquitinated forms were obtained . these results indicate that the laforin/malin complex promotes the polyubiquitination of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> through the attachment of k63-linked ubiquitin moieties. this topology was similar to the one found in other substrates of the laforin/malin complex, such as r5/ptg and ampk subunits  <cit> , and suggests that the modified pkms may be involved in cellular functions not related to proteasomal degradation.

consequences of the action of the laforin/malin complex on the biochemical properties of pkm <dig> and pkm2
we analyzed next the effect of the laforin/malin complex on the enzymatic activity of pkms. with this aim, the pyruvate kinase activity present in hek <dig> cells expressing pkm <dig> or pkm <dig> and co-expressing or not the laforin/malin complex was measured by standard methods. as expected, the overexpression of pkm <dig> increased the pyruvate kinase activity over endogenous levels  . the activity in the extract was increased further if the cells co-expressed the laforin/malin complex  but the co-expression of laforin alone  did not have this effect. on the contrary, the overexpression of pkm <dig> did not enhance the pyruvate kinase activity over endogenous levels  , and the laforin/malin complex had no effect on its activity . although at first glance these results could suggest that the laforin/malin complex increased the intrinsic enzymatic activity of pkm <dig>  we think that this is a misleading conclusion, since the steady-state levels of pkm <dig> were higher in cells expressing the laforin/malin complex . so, we think that the increase in the total pyruvate kinase activity detected in cells co-expressing pkm <dig> and the laforin/malin complex is just a reflection of more amount of the pkm <dig> protein being present in the extracts. we also observed that the laforin/malin complex did not modify the total endogenous enzymatic activity of pkm isoforms present in hek <dig> cells .fig.  <dig> effect of the laforin/malin complex on the enzymatic activity of the pkm isoforms. a crude extracts from hek <dig> cells expressing the indicated plasmids were used to determine the pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity as indicated in methods. the results were plotted as units/mg total protein in the extracts . b crude extracts from panel a were also analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. c hek <dig> cells expressing myc-pkm <dig> were transfected with the indicated plasmid. crude extracts were obtained and the pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity measured as in panel a) . crude extracts were also analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies 



we repeated the assay with cells expressing the catalytically inactive laforin c266s form. as shown in fig. 3c, the laforin c266s/malin complex was also able to increase the total enzymatic activity and the steady-state levels of pkm <dig> in the cells, indicating that this effect was not dependent on the phosphatase activity of laforin.

altered subcellular location of pkm <dig> due to the laforin/malin complex
it has been described that both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> are cytosolic proteins, what is consistent with their role in the glycolytic pathway . however, pkm <dig> but not pkm <dig> is also able to translocate to the nucleus, where it acts as a protein kinase and regulates gene expression in different ways . in order to check whether the ubiquitination of pkm <dig> by the laforin/malin complex could affect its translocation to the nucleus, we transfected human osteosarcoma u2os cells  with myc-pkm <dig> in the presence or absence of flag-laforin and ha-malin. transfected cells were treated or not with uv light  to induce the accumulation of pkm <dig> into the nucleus  <cit> . cells were then analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-pkm <dig> and anti-ha  antibodies. in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , treatment with uv light of the cells containing myc-pkm <dig> and transformed with an empty ha-vector promoted the nuclear accumulation of pkm <dig> ; 60 % of the cells presented a nuclear accumulation of pkm <dig> after uv-treatment in contrast to 30 % in the untreated sample . however, the expression of the laforin/malin complex produced a reduction in the number of cells containing pkm <dig> at the nucleus in both uv treated and untreated cells : in untreated cells, only 18 % of cells expressing the laforin/malin complex displayed a nuclear accumulation of pkm <dig>  in contrast to 30 % in cells containing an empty plasmid, and in uv-treated cells, only 47 % of cells expressing the laforin/malin complex had a nuclear pkm <dig>  in contrast to 60 % in cells containing an empty plasmid .fig.  <dig> the laforin/malin complex alters the subcellular localization of pkm <dig>  a u2os cells were transfected with plasmid pcmv-myc-pkm <dig>  cells were then treated or not with uv light  to induce the accumulation of pkm <dig> into the nucleus. the localization of pkm <dig> was determined by immunofluorescence using anti-pkm <dig> antibodies . dapi staining was also performed to define the position of the nuclei. a merge image is presented. scale bars are indicated. b u2os cells expressing plasmid pcmv-myc-pkm <dig> were co-transfected with plasmids pflag-laforin and pcmv-ha-malin. then, cells were treated of not with uv light as above. panel shows the result in uv-treated cells. the localization of malin, a nuclear protein, and pkm <dig> was determined by immunofluorescence using anti-ha and anti-pkm <dig> antibodies, respectively. c the percentage of cells having a nuclear localization of pkm <dig> was determined in  <dig> cells from all the conditions. pkm-n: cells that present pkm <dig> inside the nucleus; pkm-c: cells that present pkm <dig> outside of the nucleus



taken all these results together, we suggest that the laforin/malin dependent ubiquitination of pkm <dig> partially impairs its nuclear localization.

discussion
in this work we describe additional substrates of the laforin/malin complex, namely the muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase . we present evidence of the interaction between laforin and both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig>  and as a result of this interaction, we show that the laforin/malin complex ubiquitinates both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> by attaching k63-linked polyubiquitin chains. these results are in agreement with recent data from the ggbase indicating that pkm <dig> was ubiquitinated at different sites  and indicate for the first time that in the ubiquitination reaction participates, at least, the laforin/malin e3-ubiquitin ligase complex. therefore, ubiquitination of pkms should be added to the list of post-translational modifications that suffer these proteins  <cit> . the laforin/malin dependent ubiquitination of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> did not modify their corresponding catalytic activities. however, we noticed that this post-translational modification increased the steady-state levels of the proteins, probably because the modified forms were more resistant to their proteolytic turnover. in this way, the effect of the laforin/malin dependent modification of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> resembles that of ampkβ subunits  since also higher steady-state levels of these subunits were observed upon the action of the laforin/malin complex  <cit> . it is worth to point out that stabilization of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> levels also occurs when a phosphatase inactive form of laforin  is expressed, indicating that the phosphatase activity of laforin may not be required for inducing the malin-mediated polyubiquitination of pkm <dig> and pkm <dig>  as already demonstrated in other laforin/malin substrates, such as r5/ptg or r <dig>  two regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase type <dig> .

we next studied the effect of the laforin/malin dependent polyubiquitination on the subcellular distribution of pkms. it has been described that pkm <dig> but not pkm <dig> is able to translocate to the nucleus, where it displays specific functions . this is probably due to the presence of a nuclear localization signal  in the specific region  of pkm <dig>  not present in pkm <dig>  this nls allows pkm <dig> to interact with members of the importin family, who mediate in the translocation of pkm <dig> to the nucleus  <cit> . recently, it was reported that pkm <dig> interacted with the e3-sumo ligase pias <dig> and this resulted in the sumoylation of pkm <dig> and in an enhancement of its nuclear localization  <cit> . on the contrary, our results suggest that the laforin/malin dependent ubiquitination of pkm <dig> interferes with the localization of pkm <dig> to the nucleus. perhaps ubiquitination of pkm <dig> affects its recognition by the importin machinery, resulting in an impairment of nuclear translocation. alternatively, ubiquitination of pkm <dig> could interfere with its sumoylation since both processes affect similar lys residues and, in some cases, the introduction of one modification  prevents the alternative post-translational alteration by the other  . this negative relationship between ubiquitination and sumoylation might affect nuclear translocation of pkm <dig>  as it has already been documented in other cases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence indicating that the laforin/malin complex is able to interact with and ubiquitinate both muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase . this post-translational modification, although it does not affect the catalytic activity of pkm <dig>  it impairs the nuclear localization of pkm <dig>
