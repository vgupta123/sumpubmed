BACKGROUND
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  of the nasal planum in cats is a common indication for antitumor treatment, and larger, invasive carcinomas are often treated with external beam radiation therapy.  these tumors are mostly caused by chronic exposure to sunlight  light) with older and particularly fair-haired cats being at higher risk.  <cit>  as fur is a physical barrier to solar-induced lesions, the nasal planum as a non-haired and often unpigmented area represents a predilection site for cscc. the treatment of advanced-stage lesions at this location can be challenging.  <cit>  precancerous  lesions can persist over months to years, and in some cats a transformation to a more malignant carcinoma in-situ and subsequent invasive variant takes place.  <cit>  progression is often initially slow, and the pre-malignant or superficial variants of neoplastic condition can be treated by several means, such as photodynamic therapy , strontium- <dig> plesiotherapy  <cit> , intralesional chemotherapy  <cit> , curettage and diathermy.  <cit>  however, for larger or more invasive tumors, extensive surgical removal is often a limited treatment option, due to the aesthetically disfiguring cosmetic outcome.  <cit>  curative-intent radiation therapy has been described as a cosmetically superior option for this often rapidly destructive, painful and disfiguring variant of the disease, resulting in long and stable tumor control in these patients. .

the invasive form of the disease is thought to be a rapidly dividing tumor.  <cit>  in prior publications of our group, an accelerated external beam radiation therapy protocol applied to a small group of cats with nasal planum and periocular squamous cell carcinomas was observed to lead to better responses in cases with high ki <dig> reactivity, i.e. faster proliferating.  <cit>  with these earlier findings in mind, this retrospective, bi-institutional case series was compiled to assess the effectiveness of the previously published 10 ×  <dig>  gy accelerated radiation therapy protocol in a larger group of cats with macroscopic cscc of the nasal planum, and to evaluate tumor and treatment variables associated with local control and survival. our hypothesis was that the accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy protocol would result in a clinically acceptable acute and late toxicity profile and provide a long disease free interval  and overall survival .

methods
study design
uncontrolled, single-arm retrospective clinical study.

patient and tumor characteristics
medical records of cats with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal planum admitted to the division of radiation oncology of the vetsuisse-faculty, university of zurich, and the centro oncologico veterinario, sasso marconi, bologna, between  <dig> and  <dig> were reviewed.

cats were included in the study if they had a histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cscc of the nasal planum and underwent 10 ×  <dig>  gy radiation therapy protocol in a macroscopic setting. the outcomes of patients with cscc of the nasal planum reported in a previous study by our group  were reassessed over a longer follow-up period and included as well.  <cit>  adequate available follow-up consisting of tumor response, date of recurrence or systemic progression as well as date and cause of death was required.

clinical staging for regional and distant disease consisted of physical examination, routine complete blood count and serum biochemistry, fine-needle aspiration of enlarged regional lymph nodes and thoracic radiographs. stage was divided into groups with a modified tnm staging system: t <dig> was comprised of lesions measuring < <dig>  cm in diameter, t <dig> consisted of neoplasms > <dig>  cm in diameter; substage a: non-invasive, substage b: invasive .  <cit>  medical records were carefully studied in order to retrieve further information such as: signalment , concurrent diseases, presentation , number of previous treatments, involved site, tumor size, histology, clinical stage, response to radiation therapy, time to disease progression, treatment-related side effects or complications, time and cause of death, and date of last follow-up visit. in addition, ki <dig> levels were evaluated for prognostic influence. pathologic diagnoses and grading were made by an experienced pathologist  as described previously.  <cit>  in brief, three grades  were distinguished, with more malignant morphology indicated by higher grades. the following characteristics were scored based on a scale: lack of differentiation and of keratinization, mitotic rate, and nuclear polymorphism. a proliferation score was determined by means of immunohistochemistry for ki <dig>  as previously described.  <cit>  in brief, digital images from several randomly chosen regions of each tumor were reviewed and 600– <dig> cells were counted, each. the percentage of positive cells was determined and resulted in the following scores: score  <dig> was defined as 0–4% positive cells, score  <dig> as 5–19%, score  <dig> as 20–59%, and score  <dig> as more than 60% positive cells. tumor size before radiation therapy was evaluated by caliper measurement during physical examination. tumor volume was calculated by the rotational ellipse method .

treatment
all cats were treated with external beam megavoltage radiation therapy. radiation was delivered with a  <dig> mv  linear accelerator  using electrons. positive lymph nodes were either surgically removed later  or irradiated in a second field . treatment planning was performed by hand calculation, performed or checked by the same radiation oncologist at both institutions . for the treatments, some of the cats were positioned into a custom-made bite block for reproducible immobilization.  <cit>  the gtv  was defined as the macroscopically visible part of the lesion and a ctv , accounting for subclinical microscopic disease extension of 5 mm . the ctv-margin was then extended three-dimensionally by approximately 1 cm to define the planning target volume , accounting for patient motion, and setup uncertainties. the closest available electron insert  was used .

the recommendations for specifying dose and volumes were adhered to as proposed in the relevant veterinary medical literature.  <cit>  the according fields  were applied at 100 cm source surface distance  and energies were chosen to adequately cover the ptv. bolus was used to ensure dose homogeneity and sufficient dose-build up at the surface. the 90% isodose line was chosen to encompass this target volume and for dose normalization.  <cit>  the prescribed dose was 48 gy delivered in  <dig> fractions of  <dig>  gy applied twice per day with an interval of 6 h or more , resulting in an overall treatment time of  <dig> consecutive days.

toxicity
the veterinary radiation therapy oncology group  scheme was used for radiation related toxicity assessment at each treatment and 2-3 weeks after treatment. as further follow-up, monthly rechecks were recommended.  <cit>  specific attention was paid to wound-healing complications in the acute setting, as well as vascular or osseous complications and second malignancies in the late setting.

outcome and follow-up
outcome information was obtained by the study of medical records or regular phone communication with referring veterinarians and owners at the end of the study period. follow-up care included a medical history and physical examination at progressive intervals beyond treatment. response data was noted in a modified version in adherence to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  guidelines for dogs.  <cit>  complete remission  was defined as the disappearance of the target lesion. partial response  was defined as a reduction of at least 30% in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline. stable disease  was defined as <30% decrease or <20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from the smallest sum while on treatment. progressive disease  was defined as an increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions by at least 20% over the size present at entry on study, the appearance of new lesions, such as metastatic regional lymph nodes or distant, pulmonary metastases. responses were required to last for at least one month. follow-up imaging was based on individual risk or concurrent problems, eventual symptoms, and/or clinicians’ and/or owners’ preferences, and included thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound.

statistical analysis
statistical evaluation was performed under the supervision of a biostatistician  and computed with a commercial statistical software package . description of quantitative data characteristics, other than disease-free interval  and overall survival , is given by mean , unless otherwise specified. description of qualitative characteristics is provided in absolute and relative frequencies.

dfi was defined as the interval between the last day of radiation therapy to measurable progression of disease. os was defined as the interval between the first fraction of radiation therapy and death. cats that were still free of progression at the time of data evaluation were censored for dfi analyses. for os, all deaths were considered events and cats that were still alive at the time of data evaluation or lost to follow-up were censored. kaplan-meier survival analysis was used and followed by logrank or breslow-gehan-wilcoxon tests. in the absence of crossing of survival curves, the logrank test was applied. otherwise the breslow-gehan-wilcoxon test was used. the univariate and multiple cox-regression analysis was used to determine whether the following factors were significantly associated with dfi or os: age, weight, sex, histological grade , tumor size, tumor stage , ki <dig> proliferation index, as well as the pre-treatment hematologic parameters  and packed cell volume ). distribution in tumor volumes were skewed; thus logarithmically transformed values were used rather than raw measurements . survival estimates are presented as median with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals . moreover, hazard-ratio  together with the corresponding 95% ci is reported. results of statistical analyses with p-value less than  <dig>  were interpreted as statistically significant.

treatment protocol, side effects
all cats were treated with single electron fields with energies ranging from  <dig> to 9 mev, 6 mev was used in  <dig> cats  and 9 mev in  <dig> cats . acute side effects were assessed in  <dig> cases and consisted of grade  <dig> toxicity in  <dig> cats , grade  <dig> toxicity  in  <dig> cats , grade  <dig> toxicity  in  <dig> cats , and grade  <dig> toxicity  in two cats . late effects were assessed in  <dig> cases with no toxicity in  <dig> cats , grade  <dig> toxicity  in  <dig> cats , and grade  <dig> toxicity  in  <dig> cats . each of these  <dig> cats showed different late effects, which manifested as maxillary bone necrosis, chronic moderate stomatitis and glaucoma secondary to panophthalmitis   in one cat, each.

response to treatment
median follow-up time for censored cases  was 659 days . of the  <dig> censored cases  <dig> cats were still alive at the time of analysis , and  <dig> were lost to follow-up . of the  <dig> animals that were known to have died,  <dig>  died of tumor-related or unknown  reasons and  <dig>  died of tumor-unrelated causes. at the first evaluation at 2-3 weeks after finishing radiation therapy, response evaluation was performed in all cats. all tumors  had a complete local response . median disease free interval for all cases was 916 days  . one- and 2-year dfis were 71%  and 60% , fig.  <dig>  no difference was seen in dfi between the patients treated at the different institutions . of the tested variables, only tumor volume  showed the highest tendency to influence dfi, with larger tumors having a  <dig> -times greater risk of recurrence than the smaller ones , p =  <dig> ).fig.  <dig> disease free interval. the vertical dashed lines indicate  <dig> and 2 years




median overall survival was 902 days  . one- and 2-year oss were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , fig.  <dig>  between the patients treated at the different institutions, no difference was seen in os . of the tested variables, again, only tumor volume  influenced os with larger tumors having an  <dig> -times greater risk of dying than the smaller ones , p =  <dig> ). eight of the patients  received an additional treatment at the time of tumor progression, consisting of photodynamic therapy  or prednisone . this additional treatment prolonged survival for a mean of 137 days .fig.  <dig> overall survival. the vertical dashed lines indicate  <dig> and 2 years




on multiple cox-regression analysis, no further associations other than of tumor volume were found to influence dfi or os.

discussion
prior work has documented the effectiveness of ionizing radiation for treatment of feline nasal cscc, resulting in partial or complete response in 93–100% and reported median progression free times of  <dig>   months, )  <cit>  with 1-year disease free survivals of  <dig> %   <cit> , and estimated 1-year disease free survivals of 64%  <cit>  and about 58%  <cit> . similar to the present study, these numbers were determined in a retrospective manner, with various differences regarding radiotherapy techniques and protocols; hence a comparative interpretation of outcomes must be undertaken with care. the accelerated protocol reported here resulted in a fast and complete resolution of disease in all described cats. while the patients experiencing complete remission are not reported in one study  <cit> , proton irradiation led to a complete remission in only 60% of the cases.  <cit>  while the median dfi of  <dig>  months  in this study is longer than previously reported  <cit> , the 1- and 2-year dfis of 71%  and 60%  are comparable with other studies, as their 1- and 2-year dfis lie within our 95%ci range. also, the overall survival with a median of  <dig>  months in this study  and the 1- and 2-year survival of  <dig> % , respectively, are comparable to reported findings  <cit> . overall survival has to be interpreted with care, as it is not an ideal readout of treatment efficacy in this disease. the patients of our cohort that received additional treatments upon recurrence lived a median  <dig>  months longer.

comparable to as described in other publications, radiation treatment was well tolerated by most of the patients in this study, with clinically acceptable acute and few long-term effects.  however, due to the retrospective nature of the study, some of the mild late toxicities such as alopecia could have been underreported. only two cats had acute toxicity of grade  <dig> and they were of short duration. three cats  had suspected grade  <dig> late toxicity, which manifested in maxillary bone necrosis, chronic moderate stomatitis and glaucoma, in one case each. these side effects were rated to their highest degree and readily attributed to radiation therapy, despite the possibility of other underlying causes, such as for instance chronic infections due to dental disease or viral causes. however, it is expected that the accelerated delivery of dose leads to more severe acute side effects and the high dose per fraction and the higher incidence of acute effects can increase the risk of  late toxicity.  <cit>  it has to be taken into consideration that the onset of late toxicity has a time dependency and that the development of late adverse effects observed in our study will correspond better to the true incidence  due to the longer follow-up period in this group of cats.

compared to the outcome of the previous work of our group  <cit>  the dfi in this study was significantly longer due to longer follow up time, as most of the original cats could be followed until death.

data from the present study did not support previous observations indicating that higher proliferation rates  might be associated with longer dfis.  <cit>  since these two prior studies used two different methods  an exact comparison cannot be made. possibly due to the small number of cases the proliferative fraction assessed with ki <dig> in our study had no prognostic significance. or the prognostic significance of ki <dig> truly does not exist. in contrast, tumor volume was found to be associated with shorter relapse-free periods and remains the only prognostic factor in our findings.  <cit>  however ki <dig> proliferation rate in this study was high for most of the cases and ranged from  <dig> - <dig> %, which suggests the aggressive nature of the tumors and can still justify the accelerated treatment approach.

due to the use of archival data and considering the difficulty of exact clinical assessment of late toxicities, the authors may not have been able to describe the full range of responses in these cats. in addition, information gathered by telephone follow-up could have possibly skewed the described results by owner’s perception. dfis might have been overstated as many of the animals were seen on progression and the exact onset of disease progression might have been observed incorrectly by the owner. the bi-institutionality of the study is of a lesser concern, as the treatment planning  was done under the direct supervision of one radiation oncologist . further limitations were that the grading was not available for every patient and that some biopsy specimens available were small-sized.

CONCLUSIONS
curative-intent radiation therapy with an accelerated fractionation schedule can be considered a safe, cosmetically superior treatment option for invasive cscc of the nasal planum in cats. considering that this treatment regime results in long and stable tumor control and can be conveniently delivered in a one-week period, it can be further recommended as current standard treatment.
