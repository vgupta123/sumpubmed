BACKGROUND
the cell wall is the first plant compartment that fungal pathogens  encounter and need to breach for efficient infection to occur  <cit> . fungi have evolved a plethora of cell wall degrading enzymes ; these include polygalacturonases , pectin methylesterases  and pectate lyases, which are used to attack and colonize potential hosts  <cit> . botrytis cinerea, is a necrotrophic plant pathogen with a wide host range that infects pectin-rich fleshy fruits through secretion of fungal endopolygalacturonases   <cit>  and is responsible for significant crop damage in grapevine  in addition to other fruit crops. botrytis releases numerous metabolites and enzymes such as pgs during plant host attack which macerate the pectin component of the cell wall, thus providing the fungi with an entry route and a source of nutrients for growth and proliferation. in response, plants have co-evolved counteracting defence mechanisms, often highly pathogen specific, including an array of cell wall related-responses  and also cwde-inhibiting proteins such as polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins  and pectin methylesterase-inhibitors   <cit> . pgips are extracellular leucine-rich repeat  proteins present in the plant cell wall area with recognition and direct inhibition capabilities towards fungal epgs  <cit> . cervone et al.  <cit>  proposed that, during infection, pgips decrease the rate of epg-mediated degradation of homogalacturonan  to oligogalacturonans , and thus alter the life span of ogas, as well as the oga population’s average molecular length and concentration, which in turn is proposed to elicit a defence response in the infected plant . recently, a hybrid kinase consisting of the extracellular domain of wall-associated kinase <dig>  and the intra-cellular domain of elongation factor tu receptor  kinase was shown to bind ogas and activate defense responses  <cit> .

the main mechanism-of-action of pgips is believed to be through direct inhibition of epgs  <cit> . physical studies have demonstrated direct molecular interactions between pgips and epgs of different origins  <cit> . until recently, published literature on pgips only considered their epg inhibition functions and most of these studies were conducted in vitro. examples exist however where it has been shown that some pgip-epg pairs only interacted in the in vivo environment  <cit> , providing strong support that at least some pgip-epg pairs require other components to form a functional inhibition complex. it was hypothesized that the binding of pgip with pectin could be a means to mask the substrate thus protecting it from hydrolysis by epgs  <cit> .

additional roles outside the normal pgip-epg inhibition scenario have been reported recently. veronico et al.  <cit>  showed that the expression pattern of a native pvpgip could be linked to the degree of resistance of pea plants to cyst nematode infections. interestingly, no epg transcripts could be obtained from the cyst nematode, nor was any correlation found between pgip and native epg expression, again suggesting that pgips could have additional roles in plant-pathogen interactions outside of the classical pgip-epg inhibition hypothesis. similarly, it was found by kanai et al.  <cit>  that atpgip <dig> transcripts prolonged seed germination by influencing pectin degradation in the seed coat, strongly suggesting that pgips probably have multiple functions in planta.

by studying vvpgip <dig>  we have gained significant insight into the in vivo functions of pgips. expression analysis of the vvpgip <dig> gene showed that this gene was expressed at the onset of ripening, when fruit cell wall disassembly is known to occur, and berries become more susceptible to pathogen infection  <cit> . vvpgip <dig> was overexpressed constitutively in tobacco  and effective resistance was shown after infection by b. cinerea spores by the transformed lines  <cit> . transcriptomic and metabolite profiling analysis of these tobacco transgenic lines provided surprising results when the transgenic lines and untransformed controls were compared in the absence of infection   <cit> . the transgenic lines showed marked changes in their hormone profiles and lignin levels. moreover, this molecular profiling approach confirmed the importance of the cell wall in pgip phenotypes and provided the first proof that pgips influence cell wall composition and strengthening in a potential priming mechanism  <cit> . the transcriptomic data obtained, and additional rt-pcr confirmatory experiments, indicated that xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase  genes are down-regulated in vvpgip <dig> transgenic lines compared to wild type plants  <cit> . xet/xths are known to be involved in cell wall xyloglucan remodeling  and hence reorganization of the cellulose/xyloglucan network  <cit> . further support for this ‘xet/xth down-regulation’ data has been obtained showing a similar correlative decrease in total xet enzymatic activity in vvpgip <dig> transformed lines compared to wild-type  <cit> . these data point to a possible role for the xyloglucan  network in the vvpgip <dig> resistance phenotypes observed. in addition, the transcriptomic data showed changes in the expression of cad  transcripts suggesting modification of lignin metabolism; this was further supported by chemical data which indicated that lignification  has occurred in the transgenic lines in the absence of infection  <cit> .

the focus of the work presented here was therefore the cell wall of the well characterized vvpgip tobacco transgenic lines to investigate the role of the cell wall, and in particular, the arabinoxyloglucan network, in the resistance afforded by vvpgip <dig> expression  <cit> . cell wall profiling methods , optimized for tobacco leaves  <cit>  were used. chemical and enzymatic fractionation was used to thoroughly dissect and compare the arabinoxyloglucan network present in the vvpgip <dig> and control material. developmental profiles, as a function of four leaf positions , were obtained from wild type and pgip overexpressing lines. the arabinoxyloglucan matrix was indeed found to be altered in the vvpgip <dig> tobacco lines. the transformed lines show a modification  in the remodeling and oligomeric composition  of the leaf arabinoxyloglucan polymers during development. a model proposing how the overexpression of vvpgip <dig> in tobacco leaves results in a modified cell wall architecture, and oligomeric composition, thus enhancing plant resistance to fungal pathogens both prior to and after infection, is provided.

RESULTS
carbohydrate microarray polymer profiling of sr- <dig> versus transgenic tobacco lines
carbohydrate microarray polymer profiling  analysis was used as an initial screening approach to provide an overview of cell wall polysaccharide structures in the plants used in this study. compp analysis was performed on extracted cell wall polysaccharides and allows the profiling of cell wall material using sets of monoclonal antibodies  and carbohydrate binding modules  which show specificities toward plant cell wall-glycan epitopes  <cit> . this analysis provides information about the relative abundance of epitopes in the extracted material rather than fully quantitative data, but in contrast to fully quantitative biochemical techniques, it can provide information about polysaccharide rather than monosaccharide occurrence.

compp analysis was performed on alcoholic insoluble residue , prepared from sr- <dig> and vvpgip <dig> leaf material . leaves were harvested when the plants reached the mature 8-leaf stage in order to align the data obtained with whole plant leaf infection assays routinely performed at this same growth state  <cit> . four consecutive leaves  to leaf  <dig> ) were collected, flash-frozen, and processed to obtain air  <cit> .

apart from a few marked differences that will be discussed below, the global compp datasets were similar between wild type and transgenic leaves, suggesting that overall cell wall composition and developmental patterns were not dramatically affected by vvpgip <dig> overexpression. moreover, as the compp pattern of binding was highly similar between lines  <dig> and  <dig>  only line  <dig> data is presented in comparison to wild-type . the compp datasets generated confirmed the previous baseline study on n. tabacum sr- <dig>  <cit>  in terms of general composition of the tobacco leaf cell wall. however, the data presented here extends the evaluation of nguema-ona et al.  <cit>  by evaluating developmental patterns as a function of leaf position . a consistent decrease in mab lm <dig> binding is seen as a function of leaf age  suggesting galactan turnover during tobacco leaf maturation. similar stepwise reductions in binding, as a function of leaf position , is evident in the dataset for pectin , arabinans  and agps .

interestingly, although the developmental trend was generally preserved in the transgenic lines, some epitopes showed differential binding between the wt and transgenic lines . the most striking feature in the comparative compp data was a marked difference in the binding patterns for mab lm <dig> in naoh extracts. this mab, raised against xylosylated heptasaccharides from tamarind xyloglucan  <cit> , was found to bind less abundantly to transgenic air  than to that obtained from wild type plants; this difference in binding was found consistently between these samples regardless of leaf position used . noticeably, the pattern of differential binding of lm <dig> remains unchanged when compp analysis was performed on air first pre-treated with a sodium acetate buffer extractant  to remove potentially interfering substances such as pectin and other extracted cell wall proteins . the influence of wall bound phenolic compounds as interfering compounds in this analysis is possible but probably negligible given the specific differential responses observed in the compp datasets. the xyloglucan epitope recognized by mab lm <dig> is likely embedded in the pectin matrix  <cit> , and this step was performed to control for the possibility that pectin and associated buffer soluble components  might block access of the mab to its target resulting in the differential responses observed for the different populations. inspection of the dataset obtained after this processing reveals a much more simplified data-matrix  than that obtained from total air as, for example, most of the agp epitopes have been removed . the data for mabs lm <dig> presented in figure  <dig>  strongly support the assertion that either accessibility to, or the abundance of, arabinoxyloglucan polymers has decreased in the transgenic lines tested.

other changes observed in the transgenic lines included :  the relative amount of binding of mab jim <dig> was enhanced in transgenic material. this might indicate that transgenic plants have elevated levels of pectin esterification versus wild-type;  similarly, the agp mabs jim <dig> and jim <dig> showed differential binding patterns that could suggest altered agp organization in the transgenic material; and  subtle differences for cbm3a in cadoxen extracts between wild-type and transgenic plants was also observed. the reduced binding of mab cbm3a to transgenic material also suggests that accessibility to the arabinoxyloglucan-cellulose matrix was altered in the vvpgip <dig> lines .

monosaccharide composition analysis of wild type sr- <dig> versus transgenic tobacco leaves
to support the compp data other wall profiling methods were used to assess the effect of leaf developmental ‘age’  on the ‘global’ leaf cell wall composition. the data generated for the sr- <dig> tobacco population was used as a baseline to compare the transgenic lines. monosaccharide compositional analysis was used to assess the total cell wall composition  of air generated from leaves 3– <dig> and revealed gal and gala as the main monosaccharides in sr- <dig>  with lesser amounts of ara, rha, xyl and man, confirming the pectin-rich nature of tobacco leaves . glc was intentionally removed from the dataset  as contaminating starch complicated the interpretation. interestingly, a developmental pattern was evident in the sr- <dig> data  where the gal content decreased stepwise from ca. 25 mol% in leaf  <dig> to ca. 15 mol% in leaf  <dig>  while a converse staggered increase in gala abundance from ca. 40 mol% in leaf  <dig> to ca. 50 mol% was found. further treatment of the air with epg yielded a soluble fraction  similar in composition to total air except being noticeably deficient in xyl, man and ara. the pattern for gal and gala remained the same in the epg hydrolysed fraction , although the staggered decreases/increases were from ca. 25 mol% to ca. 10 mol% for gal and ca. 50 mol% to ca. 70 mol% for gala . this data supports the proposal that turnover of galactan chains is occurring in the pectic rhamnogalacturonan i  polymer and that this is linked to a shift from actively growing  leaves to final maturation . treatment of the epg insoluble residue of sr- <dig> with xeg yielded a soluble fraction rich in xyl, glc, rha and ara . a paenibacillus sp xyloglucan specific endoglucanase xeg <dig>  was used to digest de-pectinated leaf air and the arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharides released were analyzed using mass spectrometry and high performance anion exchange chromatography . this fraction represents the xeg-soluble fraction domain, one of the three xyloglucan domains present in the wall  <cit> , which is subject to significant metabolic turnover as observed in growing etiolated pea tissue  <cit> . interestingly, a slight decrease in the xyl content of this fraction is evident during maturation of the sr- <dig> leaves . it is known from literature that tobacco xyloglucan is arabinosylated  and is of the xxgg-type thus possessing a lower degree of xylosyl substitution of the glucan backbone as compared to the xxxg-type present in peas  <cit> . no significant difference is seen in this fraction  for the other monosaccharides as a function of leaf position in sr- <dig> leaves. furthermore no major differences in global cell wall profiles between wild type and transgenic material was evident for these analyses , confirming our preliminary cell wall compositional analysis of the transgenic lines that showed that vvpgip <dig> overexpression did not alter overall cell wall composition  <cit> .

the leaf arabinoxyloglucan oligomeric composition in sr- <dig> versus transgenic tobacco lines
furthermore, a detailed baseline analysis of the leaf arabinoxyloglucan component was conducted on sr- <dig> plants in preparation for a comparative analysis with the transgenic lines. de-pectinated air was isolated from leaves 3– <dig> and subjected to enzyme oligosaccharide fingerprinting   <cit> . enzyme treatment produced six main peaks which were present in all chromatographs generated from each of the four leaf positions assessed . the arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharide  <dig>  was found to vary in concentration as a function of leaf position . visual inspection of the trace  and quantitative analysis of peak areas  showed that the arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharide  <dig> subunit increased from leaf  <dig> to  <dig>  but decreased in leaves  <dig> and  <dig>  implying this arabinoxyloglucan component is under developmental control during leaf growth.

given the importance of the arabinoxyloglucan component to the vvpgip <dig> tobacco phenotypes , enzymatic oligosaccharide profiling was performed on air sourced from all developmental stages  from both wild type and transgenic lines. six major oligosaccharides were generated from all of the plant populations assayed and these were quantified using high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled to pulsed amperometric detection . significant differences were found for oligosaccharide  <dig>  abundance in wild type  versus transgenic leaves , less marked but significant differences were also found for peaks  <dig> and  <dig>  leaves  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from transgenic lines were consistently found to have substantially less of this arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharide component than wild type leaves . the developmental trend/pattern however was unchanged between control and vvpgip <dig> lines for leaves 3– <dig>  supporting the position that vvpgip <dig> does not influence normal growth and development . in the case of leaf  <dig> , the abundance of oligosaccharide  <dig> in the polymer has returned to near wild-type levels and no statistically significant differences were found . the most marked differences in abundance between wild-type and transgenic arabinoxyloglucan-derived oligosaccharide  <dig> was found for leaf position  <dig> ; all further detailed polymer fractionation and characterization presented are therefore only for this leaf position.

fractionation of air and comparative profiling of arabinoxyloglucan polymers sourced from wild- type and transgenic lines at leaf position 3
to determine if changes to the global hemicellulose content had occurred in the transgenic lines a standard chemical fractionation protocol was employed on air, followed by gravimetric analysis. apart from the 4 m koh fractionation  which appeared to show a small but statistically significant increase in abundance in transgenic versus wild type leaves  no major differences were found. these slight differences are difficult to interpret and may indicate a shift in polymer solubility between the different lines tested. subsequent monosaccharide compositional analysis of each fraction , sodium carbonate-  and 4 m koh  soluble fractions) showed no major differences between samples . profiling of the 4 m koh soluble fraction using pspxeg <dig> showed no compositional differences between the different plant populations . as it is known from literature that plant cell walls are composed of enzyme ‘accessible’ and ‘inaccessible’ domains  <cit> , the use of chemical extractants which indiscriminately degrade polymers may result in datasets difficult to interpret in terms of enzyme-mediated processes . to address this, an enzymatic fractionation protocol, using epg and pspxeg <dig> treatments, was also used on tobacco air sourced from leaf  <dig> samples . gravimetric analysis  showed broadly similar results to that obtained using chemical treatment. analysis of the xeg-soluble material using monosaccharide compositional analysis revealed shifts in the gala and glc content possibly indicating polymer solubility changes in this domain between lines . further compositional analysis was performed using enzymatic oligosaccharide mass spectrometry.

the pspxeg <dig> facilitated arabinoxyloglucan-derived oligosaccharide mixtures  were directly injected into a high resolution mass spectrometer and analysed by esi-ms in positive mode . almost all the ions found in the spectra were common to both the transformed and wild type lines; including m/z  <dig>   <dig> and 1085; which correspond to hex3pen <dig> , hex3pen <dig>  hex4pen <dig>  oligomers respectively, identified in nguema-ona et al.  <cit> . a relative decrease in abundance of the m/z  <dig> ion was observed in the transformed lines when compared to the neighboring ions m/z  <dig> and  <dig>  this appears to correlate with the decrease of the peak  <dig> oligosaccharide  previously reported in this study . further work is necessary to elucidate the identity of these components more fully which is beyond the scope of this current profiling study. finally, pspxeg5-insoluble material was further extracted with 4 m koh, neutralized, dialyzed, freeze-dried and suspended in sodium acetate buffer, before being digested with pspxeg <dig>  the addition of pspxeg <dig> is necessary to liberate all exposed, i.e. less tightly bound xyloglucan chains, and thereafter koh is added to compete with the strong hydrogen bonding of the xyloglucan component tightly-bound to cellulose microfibrils, as performed in ngeuma-ona et al. <cit> , the released chains are then susceptible to enzyme action. no differences were found in released oligosaccharide patterns between wild type and transgenic lines using esi-ms  or hpaec-pad , similarly for total monosaccharide composition of released material , for the xeg-insoluble fraction.

discussion
v. vinifera polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein  <dig>  is active against fungal epgs and constitutive expression of the encoding gene led to tobacco plants with decreased susceptibility against b. cinerea <cit> . when these plants were subjected to gene expression and biochemical analyses in the absence of infection, important changes to cell wall modulating activities, particularly the xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases  were discovered  <cit> . here we investigated the cell walls of the vvpgip <dig> tobacco population further by using high-throughput and fractionation techniques optimized for tobacco leaves  <cit> .

vvpgip <dig> overexpression results in subtle remodeling of tobacco leaf cell walls and alters the accessibility of the arabinoxyloglucan-cellulose network without affecting general cell wall biosynthesis and turnover
the compp datasets did not point to wholesale biosynthetic compositional changes in the transgenic lines . this was also borne out by the later cell wall compositional profiling datasets . cell wall profiling of the untransformed control leaves provided valuable baseline data on leaf cell wall development and turnover  for ultimate comparison with transgenic lines. the developmental pattern of pectin polymers  observed in the leaves resembled pectin maturation in the wall. pectin maturation during deposition/turnover is known to involve a shift from methylesterified pectin hga to the de-esterified form and linked to a parallel rigidification in the tissue as calcium ‘egg box’ cross-linking occurs  <cit> . labavitch and ray  <cit>  and later, nishitani and masuda  <cit>  commented on a turnover of galactose-containing cell wall polysaccharides in elongating pea stem segments and growing azuki bean epicotyls respectively. various studies have shown that β- <dig> -galactan associated to rg-i pectin is regulated in relation to cell expansion  <cit> ; it is also known to accumulate at the onset of cell elongation  <cit> , and is progressively degraded during and after the elongation/expansion phase  <cit> . similarly, our data indicated that during tobacco leaf maturation the gal content  decreased and the free unsubstituted pectin hga content increased which can then undergo calcium ion binding and rigidification. this developmental pattern for gal and gala levels  was not altered in the transgenic lines.

the modulation of the xyloglucan composition of the vvpgip <dig> transgenics reported in this study, together with the data presented by alexandersson et al.  <cit>  suggests that a reorganization of the cellulose-xyloglucan network has taken place that favours “strengthening”. this is supported by the compp data for particularly mab lm <dig> and to a lesser extent mab cbm3a, where decreased accessibility to these mabs was observed in the transgenic lines. the compp datasets also showed subtle remodeling occurring, as reflected by the binding of mabs jim <dig>  jim <dig> and jim <dig>  the enhanced binding observed for mab jim <dig> suggested increased esterification of pectin in transgenic lines, which would require further confirmatory investigations on the pectic components of the transgenic lines. pectin methyl esterification has been proposed to play a role in plant-pathogen interactions principally by limiting the accessibility of pectin to degradation by fungal enzymes  <cit> . expression of pectin methyl esterase inhibitor proteins  by plants is believed to block/alter the action of native pectin methyl esterases  in planta thereby modulating the level of pectin esterification  <cit> . the level of pectin methyl esterification, mediated by expression of pmeis, in turn has been correlated with a reduction in infection of botrytis cinerea <cit> . it is certainly possible that elevated levels of pectin esterification in our transgenic lines, in conjunction with the xyloglucan-cellulose modifications, are responsible for the resistance phenotypes observed during trial infections. currently there is insufficient data on pectin  and esterification levels  to support this conclusion and further experiments are underway to perform detailed analysis of pectin changes in transgenic leaves to validate the compp datatsets reported in this study.

vvpgip <dig> overexpression most likely leads to alterations in the arabinoxyloglucan xeg-soluble composition through in muro modification
the mechanical resistance of the plant cell wall is a factor important in plant-pathogen interactions as most pathogens need to disrupt wall organization during infection  <cit> . this resistance depends on the integrity of the cellulose/hemicellulose network  <cit> . pauly et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the xyloglucan network is organized into three distinct and structurally different domains: a xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase -extractable domain , a strong alkaline-extractable domain , and finally a third domain entrapped within or between cellulose microfibrils. the xeg-soluble domain in vvpgip <dig> transformed plants was found to be altered  and this is likely to have occurred in muro. two types of processes involved in xyloglucan metabolism have been well documented: the first involves a change in the biosynthesis of xyloglucan  <cit> , and the second an alteration in the in muro metabolism of xyloglucan  <cit> . in our case changes in xyloglucan biosynthesis are unlikely and no evidence has been found for this . mutations in fundamental biosynthetic pathway genes have been studied and reported to lead to differences in xyloglucan polymer composition in all three domains; this type of wholesale modification also tends to produce altered morphological and/or growth phenotypes  <cit> , which is not what was observed in the plants studied here. hence, in muro changes are a more probable explanation for the alterations that were observed in the vvpgip <dig> overexpressing lines . this type of modification has been shown to be restricted to the xeg-soluble domain of polymeric xyloglucan  <cit> , since only cell wall modifying enzymes responsible for this in muro modification are able to access this domain. it was shown that the expression of some xet/xth genes were downregulated in healthy vvpgip <dig> tobacco plants which caused a lower total enzymatic activity of xet/xth in these lines  <cit> . it is therefore highly probable that the compositional changes observed for the xeg-soluble domain in vvpgip <dig> transformed tobacco lines are a result of modified in muro enzymatic activity  and did not occur at the golgi body.

it is reasonable to think that the changes to the xet/xth enzymatic activity, in conjunction with the action of the other cell wall apoplastic enzymes acting on the xeg-soluble fraction promoted the modification we observed in the oligosaccharide composition of the xeg-soluble fraction . a number of apoplastic enzymes work in concert and act on the xeg-soluble fraction and have the potential to modify xyloglucan polymers. endoglucanases, xths having xet activity  <cit> , α-xylosidases  <cit> , β-galactosidases  <cit> , and α-fucosidases  <cit>  can contribute to the final polymer composition in the xeg-soluble domain. xyloglucan modifications in muro have been well studied in arabidopsis and mutants with changes in glycosidase activity, such as the atxyl <dig>  atbgal <dig> and axy <dig> mutants  <cit>  show significant alterations in the composition of the xeg-soluble polymers. it has recently been shown that trans-α-xylosidases and trans-β-galactosidases can act directly on the xyloglucan polysaccharide to cause modification  <cit> .

sampedro et al.  <cit>  showed that in addition to the modification which occurred in the polymeric xyloglucan of the atxyl <dig> mutant, two intermediates of xyloglucan metabolism  substantially accumulated in the growth media and probably in the soil around the roots. such accumulation of apoplastic, free and diffusible xyloglucan oligosaccharides were not found in the atbgal <dig> and axy <dig> mutants, respectively deficient in a β-galactosidase and an α-fucosidase involved in the modification of xyloglucan in muro. it thus would be of interest to investigate the occurrence of apoplastic xyloglucan oligosaccharides in our transformed lines, given the modifications observed in the xyloglucan fraction.

a proposed model for the effect of vvpgip <dig> overexpression on cell wall architecture
fungal strains are able to effectively degrade pectin rich matrics, but can be slowed-down in their attempt to physically penetrate and macerate a reinforced cellulose-xyloglucan network  <cit> . the recent sequencing of the b. cinerea genome showed that its arsenal of cell wall degrading enzymes  is very limited against hemicelluloses such as xyloglucan  <cit> . with the additional analyses provided in this study it is now possible to produce a working hypothesis  summarizing the known effects of vvpgip <dig> overexpression on cell wall-associated processes and –architecture in tobacco . vvpgip <dig> overexpression is able to induce lignin accumulation , pectin modification  and arabinoxyloglucan-cellulose re-organization . the clear consensus from this study is that vvpgip <dig> overexpression is able to cause modification and re-organization that result in a general strengthening/reinforcing of the cell wall in advance of infection. once infection occurs, the pgips would form inhibition complexes with the epg, while the altered  wall matrix further functions to impede penetration of the fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the wall developmental profile was altered in the transgenic vvpgip <dig> lines versus the wild-type controls. we also showed that polysaccharides of the xeg-soluble domain were modified resulting in an alteration of the enzyme-derived oligosaccharide profiles obtained from transgenic material. these changes did not significantly influence plant morphology or normal growth processes compared to wild-type lines. vvpgip <dig> overexpression therefore results in cell wall remodeling and reorganization of the cellulose-xyloglucan network in tobacco in advance of potential infection and provides further proof of a possible priming effect caused by the overexpression of the vvpgip <dig> and a non-epg-related function for pgips in vivo.

it is possible that pgips evolved from precursor genes that had roles outside of plant defence and that during the course of evolution were co-opted as defence proteins because of their unique properties . this also suggests that pgip genes probably have a number of other functional roles in planta, as a consequence of their evolution, including participation in plant signaling mechanisms. our data adds to the growing list of alternative functions identified for pgips lately and show that vvpgip <dig> play a role in modifying xyloglucan composition in muro prior to infection. the functional role for vvpgip <dig> in grapevine, its native genetic background, is now clearly of interest. vvpgip <dig> is predominantly expressed in berries, with expression peaking at véraison  and to a lesser extent in roots  under normal  conditions. vvpgip <dig> expression is inducible by infection and wounding  as well as hormone treatments and osmotic stress  <cit> . berry ripening involves substantial sugar accumulation among other substances and this process starts at the onset of ripening. it is therefore possible that given the observed hemicellulose-cellulose network and the remodeling properties of vvpgip <dig>  that this protein has a role in osmotic regulation in berries by tightening/restricting the xyloglucan load-bearing matrix to cope with the developmental changes in the ripening berry. unraveling the in planta functional roles of vvpgip <dig> in relation to plant-pathogen interactions and berry development remain a high priority and are supported by this approach to subject transgenic phenotypes to various profiling technologies which has proved valuable in deciphering the in planta functions of pgips.
