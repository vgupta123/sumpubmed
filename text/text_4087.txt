BACKGROUND
lipocalins are small secreted proteins , typically structured in a  <dig> strands up and down β-barrel. a  <dig> helix closes one extremity of the barrel  and a second is found parallel to its surface . the interior of the cavity can hold a small, typically hydrophobic, molecule. each lipocalin is usually well adapted to the recognition of its ligand. lipocalins can also bind to receptors and be part of macromolecular complexes. they are involved in numerous functions such as in the transport of molecules implicated in homeostasis , enzymatic synthesis, immunomodulation, olfaction, pheromone signaling and cell regulation  <cit> . the sequence identity is low among this family despite a well conserved tertiary structure. for lipocalins with differing biochemical functions pairwise identity can fall below 10%  <cit> . however, there is a core set of lipocalins, called 'kernel', that are quite closely related proteins. they share three structurally conserved regions . the more divergent lipocalins, called outliers, match no more than two of the scrs  <cit> .

recognition of the scrs permits assignment to the lipocalin family membership. however, for members not sharing the scrs motifs, structural determination is the only safe way to decide their relationship to the family. another strategy to decide their assignment is through the analysis of their exon-intron structure  <cit> . for instance, rahbp <dig> was assigned to the lipocalin family only by its structural properties  <cit> . rahbp <dig> is a histamine-binding lipocalin from the hard tick rhipicephalus appendiculatus with two binding pockets. the pocket at the bottom of the barrel is the low affinity binding site  and contains two negatively charged residues. the one near the mouth is the high affinity binding site  and contains four negatively charged residues. its similarity with other members of the lipocalin family is very low. furthermore it has an α-helix instead of a  <dig> helical structure closing the barrel.

lipocalins are widespread across species and are found in various organisms such as bacteria, plants, arthropoda and vertebra  <cit> . up to now, they have not been evidenced in the archaea domain, but this might be due to the fact that it is difficult to identify lipocalins not sharing the scrs. otherwise, an increasing number of sequences with an identity around 15% with lipocalins and missing lipocalin recognition motifs are found in protein databanks. in blood sucking arthropods, many lipocalin-related sequences, expressed in the salivary glands, have been identified  <cit> . several have been characterized, notably rahbp <dig>  and were found to be implicated in the completion of the blood meal, interfering with platelet aggregation, blood coagulation, activation of the complement system and inflammation. they are also implicated in the transmission of disease parasites such as trypanosoma cruzi and borrelia burgdorferi and tick toxicoses  <cit> . however, most of the expressed sequences, among them lir  <dig> from tick ixodes ricinus, have unknown functions and have a pairwise sequence identity with experimentally identified lipocalins within or below the twilight zone  <cit> .

the question is how to confirm that they belong to the lipocalin family and determine their function without solving their structures, which could be a long and difficult process. homology modeling has up to now been the only method available to predict the 3d structure of proteins of this size, with an accuracy comparable to a low-resolution experimental structure  <cit> . prediction of a 3d model by homology modeling requires 30% identity. it has been determined that above a cut-off of 30% sequence identity, 90% of the pairs are homologous and have an equivalent structure; below 25%, less than 10% are  <cit> . this implies that under this limit, the correct assignment of an homologous template becomes less reliable, as well as the alignment between the target and template sequences. sequence identity between lipocalins is far under this limit. it should be noted that this is not an exception since rost has determined that most of the similar protein structure pairs in the pdb appear to have less than 12% pairwise sequence identity  <cit> . therefore, before considering the construction of a 3d model with a low level of identity between the template and target, the validity of the template must be confirmed and the alignment optimized. this can be done by comparing predictions of secondary structures and accessibility to the solvent, patterns of hydrophobic and peculiar residues.

proteins can share a similar 3d-structure with low sequence similarity only if the fold is not determined by all details of the sequence but by key features  <cit> . when comparing the structures of proteins with low similarity, it is usual that a set of clustered residues remains conserved; the latter form the structural core. clarke et al. have identified a structural core for the immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich proteins  <cit> , ptitsyn, a structural core for c-type cytochromes  <cit>  and socolich et al., a cluster of evolutionarily linked residues for the ww fold  <cit> . the structural core of lipocalins has not yet been analyzed taking into account the more distant outlier lipocalins  <cit> .

the aim of this study is to provide arguments for the assignment of outlier lipocalins to this family and to help their alignment with a template for homology modeling. to achieve this goal, the conserved properties for lipocalins were identified and their structural core was analyzed using a set of ten structurally aligned lipocalins. these proteins have a maximum sequence identity of 28% and diverse functions. due to the diversity of functions, it is likely that the characteristics identified as conserved could be important for the fold and not for the function. to identify the residues implicated in the structural core, the interactions conserved for these lipocalins were determined.

the results were thereafter used to confirm the assignment of lir <dig>  a tick protein, to the lipocalin family and to align it with rahbp <dig>  the latter is an atypical lipocalin since it does not share the scrs and has an α-helix closing the bottom of the barrel. nevertheless, it shares the main structural properties identified here for the lipocalins. the alignment was used to build a 3d model for lir <dig>  despite the low sequence similarity between lir <dig> and its template, the model enables hypotheses about its binding to histamine to be made, and experimentally validated.

RESULTS
study of the lipocalin family
the lipocalins from our database  were structurally aligned with vast. a gap in h <dig> for 1pee was suppressed and another was introduced before the second helix of 1qft to improve the structural correspondence. the structural alignment is presented in figure  <dig> and the identity between the sequences in the table provided as supplementary material . the identity varies from 5% to 28% with an average value around 15%, below the nominal threshold for a reliable sequence alignment  <cit> . detection of residues in interaction in the structures was done using the pex software  <cit> . interactions are classified depending on the nature of the amino acids implicated, that is to say hydrophobic , hydrophilic , charged  and aromatic . a maximum of  <dig> interactions were taken into account for each residue, because no residue has more than  <dig> interactions. an interaction is considered to be fully conserved when it is conserved for each structure and when the interacting residues are of the same nature  throughout the alignment. if the interaction is not of the same type for one protein, it is considered to be not strictly conserved. for some structures of lipocalins  the h <dig> is not well resolved. the conservation of the barrel and h <dig> is thus considered separately from that of h <dig>  furthermore, as rahbp <dig>  is a peculiar lipocalin having an α-helix instead of a  <dig> structure closing the barrel, and does not present the structurally conserved regions  of typical lipocalins, it has been considered separately in the conservation analysis.

prior to the interaction study, the conservation of the nature of residues  was analyzed in the alignment. the size of the residue was also taken into account : glu, phe, his, lys, ile, leu, met, gln, arg, trp, tyr are considered as bulky and the others as small residues.

barrel and helix 2
conservation in the alignment
the positions in the alignment for which a property is conserved for all  <dig> sequences are indicated in figure  <dig>  among the  <dig> conserved positions,  <dig> are of a conserved hydrophilic nature,  <dig> hydrophobic, one is aromatic  and one is charged . seven positions are conserved in size. four are conserved as bulky residues and three as small, among which the conserved gly of scr <dig>  table summarizes the conserved positions in all the lipocalins. less than a half of the conserved positions have their side chains external to the barrel . all positions conserved as hydrophobic, except residue  <dig>  have a accessible surface area inferior to 30%. for residue  <dig>  the accessibility is not conserved in 1xki. owing to the absence of the c-ter region and consequently the disulfide bond, residue  <dig> is more exposed to the solvent for that particular structure. the conserved hydrophilic positions do not show conservation for their accessibility to the solvent.

for 1qft, positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are not conserved. furthermore, position  <dig>  is not a gly and  <dig>  not a trp. noticeably, for all lipocalins and 1qft, position  <dig> is conserved as a branched aliphatic residue .

conserved interactions
the interactions conserved throughout the  <dig> structures  have been studied and are represented in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  all conserved interactions involve hydrophobic residues located on the interior of the barrel, except for that between  <dig> and  <dig> implicating a trp and a basic residue  and the 169– <dig> interaction located at the interface between h <dig> and the barrel . the conserved interactions involve all strands of the barrel as well as the two helices.

conserved positions based on the vast alignment and related structural information: the position of the residue relative to the barrel; inside  or outside  and the corresponding secondary structure . the conserved properties  are also presented, i.e. hydrophobic , hydrophilic , charged , aromatic , bulky/small, as well as the conserved interaction partner .  indicates the properties and interactions shared by 1qft.

interactions conserved for  <dig> proteins out of ten  are represented in figure  <dig> and  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  two clusters of hydrophobic interactions clearly appear. the internal cluster implicates residues on β-strands at the bottom of the barrel . these residues can be seen as forming a hydrophobic belt. the internal cluster also includes h <dig>  the external cluster involves residues on h <dig>  strands β a, f, g and h and the c-terminal loop . globally, it appears that the net of interactions between strands β f, g and h is more developed than between the strands β a, b, c, d. interaction 159– <dig> is not strictly conserved; for 1a3y it is hydrophilic instead of hydrophobic.

the distance between residues may account for the reason why some interactions are not conserved for all  <dig> lipocalins. this is the case for interaction 159– <dig> in 1exs, 115– <dig> in 1a3y and 158– <dig> in 1ngl. noticeably, interaction 168- <dig> is not conserved for 1ngl, because the orientation of trp  <dig> is different than for other structures. other interactions are not fully conserved because one residue is of a different nature than the other. this is the case for interactions 159– <dig>  189– <dig> and 52– <dig> that are not conserved for all ten proteins because residue  <dig>  in 1a3y and  <dig>  in 1exs are hydrophilic. this is also the case for interactions 158– <dig> and 170– <dig> in 1aqb. some interactions that are not conserved are nevertheless compensated. for example, the hydrophobic interaction 80– <dig> is not conserved for 1pee because of the hydrophilic nature of position  <dig> . however, this residue interacts with the hydroxyl groups of tyr  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  stabilizing the protein  <cit> . it is worth noting that the interaction 91– <dig> is not conserved for nitrophorin  <dig> , but is well conserved in its close homologue, nitrophorin  <dig>   <cit> . the interaction 170– <dig> is not conserved for 1aqb because of the hydrophilic nature of residue  <dig> . however, the lack of interaction 170– <dig> seems to be compensated for the external disulfide bond between cys  <dig> and  <dig>  linking β-g and β-h. the hydrophobic interactions 189– <dig> and 52– <dig> are not conserved owing to the hydrophilic nature of residue  <dig> in 1exs. nevertheless, phe  <dig> interacts with both  <dig> and  <dig> and it appears to bridge these residues, the aromatic ring being in interaction with the cβ of ser . in addition, the interaction 52– <dig> is absent in 1ngl but compensated by another interacting pair, 219- <dig> 

interactions for 1qft
1qft is an outlier lipocalin with low similarity with the other lipocalins. it lies apart from the family since it does not share the conserved regions  of the family, it binds hydrophilic ligands and h <dig> is in α-conformation. 1qft can accommodate two hydrophilic ligands  in its cavity, one near h <dig>  and the other near the mouth of the barrel . the l site contains two charged residues, asp  <dig> and asp  <dig>  residue  <dig>  also interacts with ser  <dig> and ser  <dig>  the h site contains four charged residues asp  <dig>  glu  <dig>  asp  <dig> and glu  <dig>  three aromatic residues are in close contact with the cycle of histamine. these are trp  <dig> and phe  <dig>  which are parallel to the cycle and tyr  <dig> that is perpendicular. when the interactions conserved for all  <dig> structures  are studied, it appears that only four are conserved; three located at the junctions between the two sets of strands  and one linking strand βg to h <dig> . one interaction implicates an aromatic  and a hydrophilic  residue , the other interactions are hydrophobic .

conserved interactions identified at 90%  for lipocalins and shared by 1qft  are shown in table  <dig> and figure 2c. several interactions conserved for the 10/ <dig> lipocalins study are not conserved in 1qft. in the case of interaction 48– <dig>  the lack of conservation is due to the distance. for interaction 91– <dig>  this is due to the orientation of residue  <dig> towards the ligand. for interactions involving residues  <dig> and  <dig>  their hydrophilic nature is responsible for the non-conservation; they both interact with histamine. interactions 52– <dig> and 52– <dig> are not conserved, owing to the hydrophilic nature of residue  <dig>  but actually lys  appears to interact with leu  through its hydrophobic part. compensating interactions exist, residue  <dig>  interacts with leu  <dig> and asp  <dig> interacts with lys  <dig>  other non-conserved interactions in 1qft may be partially compensated by proximate interactions. interaction 48– <dig> may partially compensate for the loss of interaction 48– <dig>  95– <dig> may compensate for 91– <dig>  interactions 131– <dig>  161– <dig> and 170– <dig> may compensate respectively those between 131– <dig>  156– <dig> and 168– <dig> 

helix 1
in the 1xki and 1a3y structures, residues close to or belonging to the n-ter part of the  <dig> helix  are absent or not well resolved. for that reason, the conservation was studied in the n-terminal region for  <dig>  and  <dig>  structures out of  <dig> 

conservation of the positions in the alignment
when the n-ter sequences of 1xki and 1a3y are considered , positions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  have conserved properties in the h <dig> region. by comparing the proteins without 1xki and 1a3y, positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  are further conserved . for 1qft, positions  <dig> and  <dig> are conserved: position  <dig> is not a gly but preserves a small volume.

interactions study of helix  <dig> for lipocalins
conserved interactions in h <dig> for 8/ <dig> and 7/ <dig> structures are represented in figure 2b and summarized in table  <dig>  the interactions are all hydrophobic except for that between residues  <dig> and  <dig> . three interactions are 100% conserved and three others are further conserved for 7/ <dig> structures. figure 2b illustrates the importance of the central residue  in the stabilization of the bottom of the barrel. it interacts with five out of eight strands  for 7/ <dig> structures. the distance between the residues of interaction 39– <dig>  and 39– <dig>  explains why they do not appear in the 8/ <dig> conservation study. interaction 39– <dig> is missing in the 8/ <dig> study because in 1pee the side chain of residue  <dig>  is inserted between the two residues.

positions in h <dig> that are conserved and related structural information i.e. the position of the residue relative to the barrel; inside  or outside . the conserved properties  are also presented , as well as the conserved interaction partner .

interactions of h <dig> for 1qft
due to the orientation and the α-conformation of h <dig> in 1qft, residue  <dig> is not central as it is for the other lipocalins and thus is not involved in conserved interactions. hence, the way by which α-helix  <dig> interacts with the barrel has been studied separately, as shown in figure 2d. as for the other lipocalins, strands β-a, b, c, f and g interact with h <dig>  the interactions involving residue  <dig> in the other lipocalins are balanced in 1qft by those between residue  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , and  <dig>  and  <dig> . furthermore, residue  <dig>  makes an electrostatic bond with residue  <dig> , as does residue  <dig>  with  <dig>  of the βd-βe loop. the interaction between residues  <dig> and  <dig> is replaced by that between  <dig> and  <dig> 

positions with a conserved nature not showing interaction conservation
it was noticed that several positions with conserved properties in the alignment are not implicated in conserved interactions in the 9/ <dig> study. these are positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the positions with a conserved small volume . it was analyzed whether these positions were implicated in less conserved interactions. the positions with a conserved small volume are not implicated in conserved interactions. the hydrophilic positions  <dig> and  <dig> do not participate in highly conserved interactions. for position  <dig>  a conserved interaction was found with residue  <dig> for 6/ <dig> structures. furthermore, position  <dig> is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with βe  or βf-βg loop  for 6/ <dig> structures. it should be noted that for 1xki and 1a3y, position  <dig> is not hydrophobic. this may reduce the stability in this region and explain the difficulties in solving the conformation of h <dig> 

position  <dig> is implicated in a conserved hydrophobic interaction  with position  <dig> , it is also conserved in 1qft . residue  <dig>  is interacting with  <dig> for 7/ <dig> structures and with  <dig> for 6/ <dig> structures. for 1qft, position  <dig> is interacting with  <dig>  positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are part of the γ-turn between βf and βg and are also conserved for 1qft. residue  <dig> interacts with  <dig> for all structures except for 1xki. this interaction is not seen in the 9/ <dig> conservation study, due to the restraint that residues must be separated by at least two residues to be considered in interaction. for 1qft, it appears that residue  <dig> cannot make a h-bond with  <dig> owing to the presence of a disulfide bond linking βg to h <dig>  position  <dig> makes a hydrophilic, but not well conserved interaction  with  <dig>  the corresponding interaction for 1qft is 37– <dig>  this interaction might play an important role in the folding despite its low conservation, because both positions are well conserved. position  <dig> interacts with residue  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , reinforcing the external cluster.

homology modeling for lir2
lir <dig> is a protein from ixodes ricinus. psi-blast was used to scan the pdb to find a homologous protein  <cit> . the only structure found after  <dig> iterations with an e value inferior to the threshold was that of rahbp <dig> . lir <dig> has an identity around 15% with 1qft and no lipocalin recognition motifs. the clustalw alignment between lir <dig> and 1qft is shown in figure  <dig>  as for the psi-blast alignment, some aberrations are noticed. the secondary structure of lir  <dig>  does not correspond to that of 1qft in the n-ter region. furthermore, the region of lir <dig> corresponding to h <dig>  contains three prolines, that do not favor the helical conformation. in the region corresponding to βa, position  <dig>  does not correspond to an aromatic amino acid in lir <dig>  this residue is aromatic for all lipocalins including 1qft; several mutational studies have notably demonstrated the importance of that residue in the lipocalin structure stability  <cit> . position  <dig> is not bulky and hydrophobic as in the other lipocalins. the region corresponding to βb is not predicted as β. position  <dig> corresponds to an arg, while being a hydrophobic residue in lipocalins. the cysteine from βb, implicated in a disulfide bridge between the c-ter part and βb in 1qft, is also not conserved.

modification of the alignment
to alleviate those misalignments, the alignment has been manually modified taking into account the prediction of secondary structures, the conserved interactions and positions for lipocalins and the cysteines implicated in disulfide bridges for 1qft.

h1
to align h <dig> the conserved interaction between residues  <dig> and  <dig> is used . the corresponding residues for lipocalins and 1qft are both hydrophilic. positions  <dig> and  <dig> are also used: for 1qft, residue  <dig>  is small allowing to decrease the steric constraints between h <dig> and, βd and βe. a bulkier residue at that position would interfere with the interaction with βd-βe. residue  <dig> makes a hydrophobic interaction with  <dig>  in the modified alignment, residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> now correspond respectively to asn, ala, arg and val.

for the n-ter region, the secondary structure and information about disulfide bonds did not aid the alignment since, it is predicted as β-strand by prof for lir <dig> but with a low reliability and is predicted as an α-helix by npsa .

βa
residues  <dig> and  <dig> are implicated in conserved interactions: position  <dig> is a conserved trp interacting with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> is a bulky hydrophobic residue interacting with  <dig>  they both were used to align βa together with secondary structure predictions . the latter helps to obtain a global alignment but is not sufficient to avoid ambiguity, since it can be aligned in different ways. adding restraints for residues  <dig> and  <dig> permit the ambiguity to be eliminated. in the modified alignment, they respectively correspond to trp and val for lir <dig>  residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are hydrophobic and susceptible to interactions with  <dig> and  <dig> 

βb
to align βb, positions  <dig> and  <dig> were used together with secondary structure predictions. residue  <dig> is a conserved cys for arthropod lipocalins and residue  <dig> makes a conserved hydrophobic interaction with  <dig>  secondary structure predictions permit a global alignment to be obtained and residues  <dig> and  <dig> eliminate ambiguity.

βc and βd
strands βc and βd were not realigned as the secondary structure predictions are in good correspondence with that of 1qft and as positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are conserved hydrophobic residues. the corresponding residues for lir <dig> are phe, tyr and leu respectively. residues  <dig> and  <dig> make conserved interactions with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  they all correspond to hydrophobic residues in the modified alignment.

βe
in strand βe, the secondary structure predictions are in good correspondence with that of 1qft. furthermore, residues  <dig> and  <dig>  both implicated in conserved hydrophobic interactions, are conserved residues in the clustalw alignment. nevertheless, an uncertainty remains about the alignment of that region. indeed, if a gap is suppressed in n-ter to βe, the secondary structures are still in good correspondence and residues  <dig> and  <dig> are still hydrophobic residues.

to determine the correct alignment, position  <dig> is used. in 1qft, asn  <dig> makes two h-bonds with the nh and co groups of the backbone of the twisted βd-βe loop. this loop is of equivalent length in 1qft and lir <dig>  and is longer than for other lipocalins. in the case where a gap is suppressed in n-ter, residue  <dig> corresponds to asn for lir <dig>  for this reason, the latter was chosen. in that case, residues  <dig> and  <dig> correspond respectively to met and phe.

βf, βg and βh
strands βf, βg and βh were not realigned as the secondary structures are in good correspondence and as residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are potentially able to make the conserved interactions.

h <dig> and βi
h <dig> and βi were not realigned, as positions  <dig> and  <dig> are both cys, as in 1qft. in the latter, two disulfide bridges are present. one joins the c-ter part to βb and is conserved for arthropod lipocalins . the other bridges h <dig> to βg . the corresponding cys of lir <dig> are conserved; furthermore, lir <dig> possesses two supplementary cysteines that could form a disulfide bridge between h <dig> and βh.

in the modified alignment, almost all residues in the hydrophobic internal cluster of lir <dig> are conserved, only residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  are hydrophilic, as for 1qft. in the external cluster, positions  <dig> and  <dig> are arg. despite their hydrophilic nature, they are able to make hydrophobic interaction through their hydrophobic tail  <cit> . the sequence corresponding to loop βf-βg in lir <dig> is similar to the scr <dig> motif of the lipocalins. residues thr-asp-tyr in 1aqb are equivalent to ser-asn-tyr in lir  <dig>  <cit> .

the fairly good correspondence between the secondary structures of 1qft and lir <dig>  combined with the conservation of the residues implicated in the two conserved hydrophobic clusters and the conservation of the cys involved in disulfide bridges in 1qft, lend support that lir <dig> belongs to the lipocalin family.

3d model
a 3d model was constructed using the refined alignment and the 1qft structure as template. modeller was used to build the model  <cit> . its stereochemical validity was checked with the procheck algorithm  <cit> . only one residue is in the disallowed phi/psi region of the ramachandran plot. three others, located in loops, are in generously allowed region. in the model, it is noted that the two cysteines located on βh and h <dig>  have no correspondence in 1qft and are facing each other . the distance between the cα of the two residues is  <dig> Å, compatible with a disulfide bridge. for that reason, a model where cys  <dig> and cys  <dig> were restrained to form a disulfide bridge was calculated. this model is similar to that built without restraint . in the model, all interactions conserved for lipocalins  are found for lir <dig>  except for that between residues equivalent to positions  <dig> and  <dig>  as for 1qft, residue  <dig> interacts with  <dig>  neither interactions with residue  <dig>  are conserved owing to the orientation of its side chain, which points outside. interactions involving residues  <dig> and  <dig> are not conserved in lir <dig> because of their hydrophilic nature. as for 1qft, the residue equivalent to  <dig>  interacts through its hydrophobic tail with  <dig>  and interacts with  <dig> .

experimental measurement of the secondary structure
ftir measurements permitted the determination of the secondary structure of lir <dig>  the ftir spectrum presents a maximum at  <dig> cm- <dig>  characteristic of β-structure . after deconvolution, there is 22% of α-helix, 48% of β-strand, 17% of turns and 13% of coil. this is typical of lipocalins, notably 1qft that has 19% α-helix, 43% of β-strand, 24% of turns and 13% of coil, as determined on the rx structure.

prediction of ligand binding
the analysis of the internal cavity of lir <dig> reveals that the bottom of the barrel is more hydrophobic than for 1qft and that the upper part contains almost all the hydrophilic residues of the cavity. as shown in figure  <dig>  the hydrophobic residues in the bottom of the barrel are conserved between lir <dig> and 1qft; i.e. trp , phe , val , tyr , leu , met , phe , val , leu  and trp .

when comparing the residues of the l site, that participate in the binding of the histamine in 1qft, to the corresponding residues in lir <dig>  it appears that the negative residues asp  <dig> and  <dig>  are not conserved. in 1qft, these have been shown to interact with histamine. the corresponding residues in lir <dig> are asn  and thr . as no negative residue is conserved in the l site for lir <dig>  no binding of histamine is predicted for that site.

concerning the h site in lir <dig>  the negative residues are pretty well conserved; only residue  <dig>  is not. however, lir <dig> contains a positive residue  in the cavity and two others  that are susceptible to belong to the ligand-binding pocket; these would repulse for histamine binding. furthermore, the aromatic residues  that are parallel to the cycle of histamine in 1qft are not conserved in lir <dig> . for rahbp <dig> , such a substitution  causes a significant decrease in affinity for histamine  <cit> . furthermore, in the loops surrounding the entry of the h site, the ratio of negative to positive residues is 7/ <dig> for 1qft and 2/ <dig> for lir <dig>  in 1qft, the presence of these negative residues in the loops were proposed to contribute to the attraction of histamine to the binding site  <cit> . for the h site, despite the fact that most of the negative histamine-binding residues are conserved, the absence of the aromatic residues and of one negative residue should hinder high affinity binding of histamine for lir <dig> 

experimental determination of the affinity of lir <dig> to histamine
lir <dig> and rahbp <dig> were expressed in 293t free-serum cell medium. the ability of lir <dig> to bind histamine was tested by incubating concentrated supernatant cells containing lir <dig> with 3h-histamine. rahbp <dig> was used as positive control, and a concentrated supernatant of untransfected cells used as negative control. these binding assays show high affinity for rahbp <dig>  and no affinity for lir <dig>  confirming that lir <dig> is unable to bind histamine, as predicted from the model .

discussion
the aim of the present work is to provide information to help the construction of 3d models for the weakly related proteins of the lipocalin family. the members of this family have a wide variety of functions and are hence of biological importance. the identity between lipocalins can fall below 10%. building a 3d model by homology modeling for proteins having an identity below the 25–30% cut-off is quite risky and requires that the selection of the template and the alignment with the target be further validated. this can be done by comparing predictions of secondary structures, accessibility to the solvent and patterns of hydrophobic and peculiar residues. in this work, information about the structural core of lipocalins was extracted and used to build a 3d model for lir <dig>  a protein from the tick ixodes ricinus. for that purpose, a set of lipocalin structures was analyzed and conserved properties were identified. to capture the widest diversity it was tried to find a structure for each clade identified in the phylogenic study of lipocalins . nine structures were collected. nitrophorin  <dig>  and rahbp <dig>  were included into the study. the latter was studied separately owing to its uncommon α-conformation of the first helix and to its hydrophilic binding sites. the lipocalins were structurally aligned with the vast method.

conserved positions of the alignment
to analyze the conserved properties of the alignment, the amino acids were classified as hydrophobic, hydrophilic, aromatic, charged, bulky or small. for the  <dig> lipocalins, having a mean length of  <dig> amino acids, only  <dig> positions are conserved, two are kept strictly identical  and trp  from scr1) and one is negative . the ratio of conserved hydrophobic versus hydrophilic positions is nearly three to one. all conserved hydrophobic positions have a solvent accessible surface less than 30%. the size of the residues is less conserved than their hydrophobicity. only  <dig> positions are conserved in terms of size; however this is not unusual  <cit> .

the side chain-side chain interactions were studied for each structure. interactions were divided into four classes depending on the nature of the residues implicated, i.e. hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged or aromatic. at first, rahbp <dig> was not considered in the analysis and the conservation of interactions for 10/ <dig> and 9/ <dig> structures were analyzed. in both studies, no conserved electrostatic or aromatic interactions were found and mostly all conserved interactions were hydrophobic. the pattern of hydrophobic interactions suggests the existence of two clusters, one internal to the barrel and one external. the internal cluster is composed by residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , and the external by residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , when considering the 9/ <dig> study.

in the internal cluster, the β strands are linked by  <dig> hydrophobic interactions , forming what can be seen as a hydrophobic belt. a similar belt was detected in the  <dig> β-strand barrel of the lipid-binding protein family  <cit> . this belt is linked to the central residue  of h <dig> by  <dig> interactions, coming from  <dig> different strands . the central residue hence appears important in the structural core of lipocalins. the helix is further stabilized by an internal hydrophilic interaction. among the conserved positions in the alignment and not appearing in the conserved interactions  are positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  they are involved in less conserved interactions between the barrel and h <dig> 

the external cluster implicates helix  <dig> and strands β-a, β-f, β-g, β-h as well as the c-terminal region; six interactions are conserved . there is also an additional hydrophilic interaction  that stabilizes the βf-βg loop .

it should be noted that all conserved hydrophobic positions in the alignment are implicated in conserved interactions, except positions  <dig> and  <dig>  for which interactions are conserved for a fewer number of structures. these last two positions belong to the external cluster. among the  <dig> conserved hydrophilic positions in the alignment, three are implicated in scr <dig> and one  seems to be involved in the stabilization of the interaction between strands βb and βc on the external surface of the barrel.

our results were compared to those of ragona and col.  <cit>  who have identified by nmr the interacting residues in partially folded bovine β-lactoglobulin at ph  <dig>  these residues located in the cavity of the barrel correspond to positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in our alignment. residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> could not be unambiguously detected by nmr, but they were assigned by the authors to the internal cluster using the x-ray structure. all these residues are in good correspondence with those identified in the present study. the interacting residues in the external cluster  correspond to positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  residues  <dig>   <dig> were furthermore assigned to this cluster using the x-ray data. residue  <dig> was not detected as making conserved interaction in our study. this is due to the presence of a beta bulge in the 77– <dig> region. this bulge is present in our study for β-lactoglobulin , the odorant binding lipocalin from nasal mucosa of pig  and the mouse major urinary protein . residues  <dig> and  <dig> respectively interact with residues  <dig> and  <dig> in the nmr study. in the present work, residues  <dig> and  <dig> do not appear to interact owing to the orientation of h <dig> towards the barrel that differs for β-lactoglobulin. residues  <dig> and  <dig> were not detected to be involved in a strictly conserved interaction. in effect they show interaction for 6/ <dig> structures and two structures have an arg at position  <dig> interacting through its hydrophobic region with residue  <dig>  likewise, residue  <dig>  of rahbp <dig> is also interacting with  <dig> through its hydrophobic region.

it was suggested that β-lactoglobulin at acidic ph is in a molten globule state, similarly to the retinol binding protein  <cit> . since the residues implicated in interactions in the β-lactoglobulin molten globule correspond well with those conserved for native lipocalin structures, it supports the hypothesis that residues essential in the native structure of the lipocalins are also important for the folding, as suggested by ragona et al.  <cit> . clarke et al. reached a similar conclusion for the immunoglobulin-like proteins, a highly diverse protein family with no conservation of function and little or no sequence identity  <cit> .

greene et al. have studied the evolutionarily conserved residues  in  <dig> lipocalins  <cit> . many of those residues are hydrophobic and equivalent to those highlighted in this work . however, no residues from βb, βc, βd are found conserved by greene et al. even if fewer interactions are conserved for these strands, our study and that of ragona et al. <cit>  clearly suggest that some residues of these strands also play a role in the hydrophobic internal cluster, closing the belt. this discrepancy could be due to the fact that our alignment is based on the structures and not on the sequences alone. some other residues, such as  <dig> and  <dig> belonging to the βf-g loop  are described as ecr, but are not found as conserved in this study. this is because outlier lipocalins were included in the alignment. since residues  <dig> and  <dig> are implicated in conserved interactions for 11/ <dig> structures it is surprising not to see them in the ecrs. again this could be due to the way lipocalins were aligned.

rahbp2
in our alignment, rahbp <dig>  was added. the latter is an outlier lipocalin with a low similarity to the other lipocalins. it lies apart from the family since it does not share the conserved regions of the family, binds a hydrophilic ligand and its h <dig> is in α-conformation. when considering rahbp <dig> in the conservation analysis, it comes out that only four interactions are conserved for the  <dig> lipocalins, three in the internal cluster and one in the external. the interactions in the barrel link the two sheets  together. when comparing the interactions conserved for the 9/ <dig> lipocalins to those of rahbp <dig>  it appears that the belt is not fully conserved owing to the hydrophilic nature of two residues  and to the orientation of residue  <dig>  involved in the binding with histamine. the interaction 48– <dig> is not present: due to the α-conformation of h <dig>  residue  <dig> moves away from residue  <dig>  nevertheless, there are neighboring interactions than can compensate these lacks. h <dig> of rahbp <dig> has no central residue equivalent to residue  interacting with strands βa, βb, βc, βf and βg, while still interacting with those strands through different residues.

thus, even though h <dig> has a different conformation and though there are two hydrophilic binding sites, the hydrophobic internal cluster of rahbp <dig> is fairly well conserved. the external cluster of rahbp <dig> is conserved except for interactions 52– <dig> and 52– <dig> because of the hydrophilic nature of residue  <dig>  but a careful analysis reveals that residue  <dig> interacts through its hydrophobic moiety with residue  <dig>  for rahbp <dig> , a disulfide bond bridges βg to h <dig> 

modeling of lir2
to determine the homology and build a 3d model for lir  <dig>  a protein with only 15% identity with rahbp <dig> , information was combined from the analyses of the structural core of lipocalins, the positions of cysteines implicated in disulfide bridges in rahbp <dig> and the secondary structure. in a first approach, alignment between lir <dig> and rahbp <dig>  was carried out by clustalw. the alignment showed inconsistencies in the cys bonding pattern, the secondary structures and the conserved hydrophobic residues. it was corrected for h <dig> and strands βa, βb and βe. the information obtained from the comparative analysis enabled the alignment to be improved. due to the low similarity between the two sequences, the secondary structure prediction of lir <dig> and the cysteine bridge conserved among arthropod lipocalins did not provide enough information to obtain an unambiguous alignment. this holds true for psi-blast alignment . the information from conserved interactions has permitted to obtain a coherent alignment. it is important to note that the analysis of the structural core is not aimed to perform better than psi-blast , but rather to eliminate ambiguities and assess the alignment obtained by those methods.

the corrected alignment enabled the building of a 3d model for lir <dig>  the model shows a potential disulfide bridge, not present in rahbp <dig>  supporting both the assignment of the fold and the alignment . this is further supported on one hand by the ftir measurements that indicate a secondary structure compatible with the lipocalin fold and on the other hand by the conservation in lir <dig> of most of the conserved hydrophobic interactions. despite its homology with rahbp <dig>  the analysis of the model of lir <dig> does not suggest binding to histamine, as confirmed experimentally. a more detailed study of the cavity should further help to understand the nature of its natural ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
the lipocalins are part of a protein super-family with a low level of pairwise similarity, making homology modeling a difficult task. in this study, it was shown that the determination of the residues implicated in the hydrophobic core of lipocalins, by analyzing the conserved interactions, enabled to assess the assignment of a lipocalin-like protein and to improve the "classical" alignment in ambiguous regions. information obtained from that study should help modeling other lipocalin-like proteins. this study could be applied to other protein families with low pairwise similarity, such as the structurally related fatty acid binding proteins or avidins.
