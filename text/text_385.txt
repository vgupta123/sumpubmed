BACKGROUND
brassica rapa l. plants have a rich morphological and genetic diversity, comprising many plant subspecies that humans farm on an enormous scale worldwide. examples of agriculture crops include turnip, field mustard, and chinese cabbage. non-heading chinese cabbage , with its five varieties, is an excellent model to study the genetics and mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity. of particular interest are its flowering and self-incompatibility characteristics. in general, a higher plant’s conversion from vegetative growth to flowering is a pivotal point in ontogeny and decides the timing and quality of its reproduction. floral induction has become a focus of research in brassica vegetables  <cit> , and non-heading chinese cabbage is an important tool in this regard.

recent progress in molecular biology techniques has revealed that floral induction is regulated through long-day, autonomous, vernalization, and gibberellin-dependent genetic pathways  <cit> . early- and late-flowering mutants have been identified in the model plant arabidopsis, and many key genes controlling flowering have also been isolated in other plants, genes that include flc, lfy, ft, and soc <dig> <cit> . however, there were few reports about the flowering of the non-heading chinese cabbage, or the genes that regulate flowering.

self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism that prevents self-pollination  and inbreeding with close relatives. it promotes the divergence of species; any allele that is rare in the population has an advantage if residing in a plant that cannot self-fertilize. in angiosperms self-fertilization is prevented by the chemical recognition of pollen by pistils, which depends on self-sterile -alleles in pollen or stigma, and has evolved independently at least three times  <cit> . however, the shift from outcrossing to selfing is a common evolutionary trend in higher plants related to the loss of function under natural selection of the s-alleles in pollen or stigma  <cit> . thus, the plant self-incompatibility system is an excellent model for understanding the variability in s loci. shifts between outcrossing and selfing and frequency-dependent selection leads to the long-term maintenance of many alleles with different incompatibility types  <cit> , and alleles thus become widely dispersed throughout different populations of species  <cit> .

in non-heading chinese cabbage production, the self-incompatibility system is relied on for breeding, and also makes the plant a model system for studying reproductive biology and balancing selection  <cit> . with the recent development of next-generation, high-throughput sequencing technologies, the expression profiles of many species have been extensively studied. in addition, digital gene expression tag profiling has been used to study changes in gene expressions  <cit> , giving a comprehensive snapshot of changes in mrna expression that occur during biological processes. expression levels can be calculated by the number of detected tags, and this information can facilitate our understanding of plant genetics and developmental mechanisms.

as of yet there has been no report of an expression profile for non-heading chinese cabbage. to identify differentially expressed genes  among different non-heading chinese cabbage accessions in their natural environment, we conducted an expression profile analysis for plants growing under non-controlled conditions. among the five varieties of non-heading chinese cabbage produced in china, approximately 80% is pak-choi . therefore, we chose three accessions of pak-choi  for investigating the differences in expression profiles, at five important developmental stages. relative to the accessions nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig> bolts and flowers later, and nhcc <dig> is the only one that is self-incompatible. the leaf color of nhcc <dig> is lighter than that of nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  we systematically and comprehensively evaluated the expression profiles of these accessions, to identify the degs at the five development stages, to analyze their expression patterns, and to identify candidate genes associated with important agronomic traits.

RESULTS
expression profiling of non-heading chinese cabbage
we used high-throughput sequencing to survey the gene expression patterns of three non-heading chinese cabbage cultivars  at five development stages . a total of  <dig>  million reads of raw tags were sequenced. after filtering, we obtained approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  million reads of clean tags for nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig>  respectively, of all five developmental stages combined . in these clean tags,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  reads from nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig>  respectively, could be mapped to non-heading chinese cabbage genes modeled from the nhcc <dig> draft genome, and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  reads from the respective accessions could be mapped to unique genes .

a total of  <dig>  <dig> genes were detected at the five developmental stages of the three non-heading chinese cabbage accessions . there were  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig> expressed genes shared by all five development stages in nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig>  respectively. we also conducted a study of gene expression in the different accessions at each stage. a total of  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig>  <dig> co-expressed genes in all three accessions were detected in the leaf, rosette, adult, bolting, and flowering stages, respectively .

identification of degs in non-heading chinese cabbage
a total of  <dig>  <dig> unique genes were found to be differentially expressed among the three accessions in the five development stages . the number of degs per accession or developmental stage is shown as a venn diagram and in tables . to gain insights into the degs, we conducted a chi-squared test, and the p values were corrected using the false discovery rate . the upregulated and downregulated genes are shown in a scatterplot .

we used the cluster program  to identify subgroups in the gene expression profiles that shared common features and had similar expression levels. we hypothesized that degs gathered in one group might have similar functions, or be involved in the same metabolic processes. in our analysis, clusters were plotted according to the deg expression values. in cluster, the degs that had similar expression levels were clustered together. by using these clusters, we could infer the function of newly identified genes according to the known genes in the same cluster, such as the cluster of flowering and self-incompatibility candidate genes .

functional annotation and pathway analysis of degs
the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process associated with each of the degs were obtained using the gene ontology  database. for example, there were more genes related to antioxidant activity, translation regulator activity, and reproduction in nhcc <dig> than in nhcc <dig> at the seedling stage. however, there were more auxiliary transport genes in nhcc <dig> than in nhcc <dig> . the genes that belonged to the same orthologous cluster were classified into one group, based on the clusters of orthologous groups  database. taking the degs of nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> at the seedling stage as an example, the cluster results showed that most deg genes belonged to the general function category, followed by genes related to translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis . kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis was performed to elucidate the energy metabolism, signal transduction, and biological systems of degs. we found that several degs are involved in several important pathways for plant growth and development, such as flowering genes and chlorophyll gene pathways, described in detail below.

analysis of flowering time genes
we identified nearly  <dig> genes that had a tendency to increase from the adult to the bolting stages, corresponding to the change from vegetative to reproductive growth. these genes are mainly involved in: transcription regulation pathways, such as for rna-binding proteins; protein biosynthesis, such as ribosomal protein l1/l13/s7; ubiquitin signaling, such as ubiquitin protein, zinc finger , serine/threonine protein kinase, and glycine-rich protein grp-3; and flower morphogenesis . in contrast, nearly  <dig> genes showed a tendency to decrease from the adult to the bolting stages. these genes are mainly involved in glutamine metabolism ; the protein phosphatase pathway ; transcription regulation ; protein biosynthesis ; and some transcription factors . this result is consistent with ratcliffe et al.  <cit>  and he et al.  <cit> . cbf <dig> and tiny were expressed rarely in the bolting stage and not expressed in the flowering stage.

seo et al.  <cit>  found that overexpression of cold-inducible cbfs could increase expression of flowering locus c , an upstream negative regulator of soc <dig>  thus delaying flowering. in addition, low temperature could induce the expression of the cbfs  <cit> . overexpression of the cbf <dig> gene also leads to increased freezing tolerance in arabidopsis <cit> . because there is crosstalk between cold response and flowering, we hypothesized that decreased expression of cbf <dig> was related to the conversion from vegetative to reproductive growth.

we also found some genes that are specifically related to the late flowering of nhcc <dig>  an example is flm , a mads-box transcription factor that is a negative regulator of flowering  <cit>  expressed in the bolting and flowering stages of nhcc <dig>  but not in nhcc <dig> or nhcc <dig> . the results of qrt-pcr were in accord with this expression trend . this suggests that flm may be the reason for late flowering in nhcc <dig> 

gibberellin-insensitive gene  was also found in the bolting stage of nhcc <dig>  but not detected in any stages of nhcc <dig> or nhcc <dig> . the qrt-pcr results for this gene showed lower expression levels in nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> relative to that of nhcc <dig> at the bolting stage . many studies have shown that gibberellin is required for flowering in arabidopsis during short days  <cit> . increased expression of gibberellin-insensitive gene in nhcc <dig> weakens the role of gibberellin in promoting flowering. therefore, high expression of flowering suppressor genes may be a reason for late flowering in nhcc <dig> 

the ft  gene , which promote flowering  <cit> , were expressed only at the flowering stage in nhcc <dig>  while they were expressed in the bolting and flowering stages in nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> . in the circadian pathway of flowering, ft was negatively regulated by elf <dig> <cit> . our expression profiling analysis found that the elf <dig> gene  gradually increased and then decreased in all three accessions. the expression of elf <dig> peaked during the adult stage of nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> and in the bolting stage of nhcc <dig>  the homologous genes, elf <dig>  and elf <dig> , showed the same trend . these results suggest that delayed expression of flowering genes might further explain late flowering in nhcc <dig> 

specific genes at the flowering stage may be related to the process of flower development and pollination. our findings indicate that the expression levels of some genes, such as cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> and cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  were significantly highest at the flowering stage of all three accessions. cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> gene, which encodes for ark <dig> protein and is homologous to slg , is involved in recognition of self-pollen  <cit> . cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> gene encodes for agl <dig>  and functions as a dna binding and transcription factor. members of the mads-box gene family have important roles in flower development, and participate in determining the identity of floral meristems early in flower development and of floral organ primordia later in flower development  <cit> .

analysis of cold-tolerance genes
from expression profiling, we found that two cold-regulated genes  showed a higher expression level at the rosette stage  than at the other four stages .

weather temperatures fluctuate significantly in nanjing during autumn and winter. for example, in  <dig> the temperature dropped from 10°c to 0°c over five days . these dramatic changes in the external temperature may be the reason for the high expression of cold-regulating genes. to test this inference, we studied the expression levels of these two genes using quantitative real-time pcr . the results showed that the relative expression values were > <dig> after 12 h at 4°c treatment. in addition, the relative expression levels were also changed after abscisic acid  and polyethylene glycol  treatments. in general, low temperature, peg, and aba crosstalk to activate stress gene expression, and the expression of most cold-related genes is also affected by peg or aba treatments. therefore, we suggest that the high expression of these genes was closely linked to cold resistance in non-heading chinese cabbage.

analysis of self-incompatibility genes
three genes, cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  and cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  were expressed at all five stages and specifically existed only in nhcc <dig> . these genes encode serine/threonine protein kinase, nac domain-containing protein  <dig>  and dynein light chain type  <dig> family protein, respectively. among them, cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> and cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> showed significantly decreased levels at the bolting and flowering stages compared with vegetative stages. however, the cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> transcript increased at the bolting stage and declined at the flowering stage. in the process of self-pollination, serine/threonine protein kinases, such as s-locus receptor kinase  and m-locus protein kinase , are involved in recognition and autophosphorylation in self-incompatible signaling pathways  <cit> . thus, changes in the expression levels of cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> could influence the activation of serine/threonine protein kinase, thereby affecting the recognition and rejection of self-pollen. nac domain-containing proteins are plant-specific transcriptional factors involved in regulating several plant developmental processes, such as flower and embryo development  <cit> . thus, these specifically expressed genes might be related to self-incompatibility of nhcc <dig> 

we also found that cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> had higher transcripts at all stages in accessions nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  while it was expressed at low levels at the bolting and flowering stages in nhcc <dig> . this gene encodes ribosomal protein l <dig>  which is involved in the assembly of proteins. the downregulation of ribosomal protein l <dig> might be related to the suppression of self-pollen development in nhcc <dig>  compared with nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>   <dig> genes of the nhcc <dig> accession showed lower transcript levels, with zero tpm, even during flowering.

interestingly, some genes encoded vesicle coat complex and atexo70h <dig>  which are related to secretory protein trafficking and polarized exocytosis  <cit> . exo70a <dig> participates in the growth of pollen tube tips and has been identified as a negative regulator in the brassica self-incompatibility response  <cit> . we found that the expression levels of vesicle coat complex and atexo70h <dig> were higher in nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> compared with nhcc <dig> accession, given that the expression levels of these proteins were nil at the flowering stage. the low abundance of vesicle coat complex and atexo70h <dig> implied that they might have similar functions as negative regulators in the self-incompatibility response of nhcc <dig> 

analysis of leaf color genes
we analyzed the genes associated with leaf color. these genes have an important role in the control of chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast structure, and plant development. moreover, they might affect crop yields by regulating photosynthesis. therefore, it is crucial for improving crop production to identify leaf-color related genes and uncover the genetic basis of the leaf color trait. the chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured using a portable chlorophyll meter . the measurement results showed that the chlorophyll indices of nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> were significantly different at the rosette stage. after analyzing the genes involved in the chlorophyll gene  pathway of these two accessions, we found that the light leaf color of nhcc <dig> is most likely due to decreased chlorophyll synthesis, perhaps resulting from lower chlorophyllase activity  <cit> .

the cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> gene, which encodes the chloroplastic protein fluorescent in blue light, was also expressed at lower levels in nhcc <dig>  furthermore, qrt-pcr showed the same expression pattern as the expression profile . it is involved in the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and might be a negative regulator of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in chloroplasts  <cit> . this result implied that cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> could also be a candidate gene related to chlorophyll biosynthesis in non-heading chinese cabbage.

degs in the genomic colinear blocks between b. rapa and a. thaliana
in our expression profile,  <dig>  <dig> genes were expressed and  <dig>  <dig>  of the expressed genes were mapped to  <dig> chromosomes. in these expressed genes,  <dig>  <dig>  were identified as degs of different accessions or developmental stages, and  <dig>  <dig>  genes were located on the  <dig> chromosomes. to show the up- and downregulation of degs in a more intuitive way, we labeled the degs on each chromosome with the regulation information .

a total of  <dig> colinear blocks were identified between the genomes of non-heading chinese cabbage and arabidopsis. finally,  <dig>  colinear blocks were obtained after removing the blocks that contained fewer than  <dig> genes from consideration. of the  <dig>  <dig> degs, nearly half of them  were located in the colinear blocks . in non-heading chinese cabbage and heading chinese cabbage,  <dig> colinear blocks were identified. four hundred and twelve  colinear blocks were obtained after removing the blocks containing fewer than  <dig> genes. a total of  <dig> %  of the degs were identified in the colinear blocks .

to further characterize the relationships among non-heading chinese cabbage, heading chinese cabbage, and arabidopsis we analyzed the paralogous and orthologous genes among them. there were  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig>  <dig> paralogous gene pairs in the entire genomes of non-heading chinese cabbage, heading chinese cabbage, and arabidopsis, respectively. for the orthologous genes, there were  <dig>  <dig> gene pairs between non-heading chinese cabbage and arabidopsis, whereas there were  <dig>  <dig> gene pairs between non-heading chinese cabbage and heading chinese cabbage. furthermore, we investigated the number of differentially expressed paralogous genes that existed in non-heading chinese cabbage, and we found that  <dig>  genes had a paralogous gene in non-heading chinese cabbage . of these genes,  <dig>  had only one paralog. the number of the paralogs was > <dig> for  <dig> degs, and > <dig> for  <dig> degs.

most of the genes that had > <dig> paralogs belonged to the non-long terminal repeat retroelement reverse transcriptase. we used the pfam program   <cit>  to identify  <dig> paralogs that belonged to  <dig> degs. among these paralogs, most encoded proteins were leucine-rich repeat protein, protein kinase domain protein, wd domain, and g-beta repeat .

we also analyzed orthologous pairs of degs, identifying  <dig>  <dig> genes that were orthologous between the non-heading chinese cabbage and heading chinese cabbage. of these,  <dig> genes had one ortholog in heading chinese cabbage,  <dig> genes had > <dig> orthologs in heading chinese cabbage, and one gene  had  <dig> orthologs in heading chinese cabbage. while there was a total of  <dig>  <dig> orthologs  between non-heading chinese cabbage and arabidopsis ,  <dig> genes had only one ortholog in arabidopsis, which decreased to  <dig> when the number of orthologs was > <dig>  interestingly, the same gene  also had a relatively high number of orthologs  in arabidopsis. the same gene also had  <dig> paralogs in non-heading chinese cabbage. although the explanation for the high number of copy number variations for this gene is unknown, we inferred that it might affect plant growth. therefore, we annotated its function, which revealed that it was a disease resistance protein .

CONCLUSIONS
in our analysis, we identified numerous degs related to important agricultural traits. by comparing cultivars and developmental stages, we found many genes associated with flowering time, self-incompatibility, cold-tolerance, and leaf color. although the functions of most of the other degs are not known, this study will further our understanding of the expression pattern of these genes and genetic improvement of non-heading chinese cabbage or other cruciferous vegetables, as well as basic biological research. in particular, clarification of the regulatory networks involved in flowering will contribute to the cultivation of new late-flowering varieties, which can provide a wealth of resources for breeding. this detailed analysis of the expression profiles of non-heading chinese cabbage provides the first comprehensive review of the expression patterns of five development stages, and has unveiled numerous candidate genes that may underlie morphological and genetic polymorphisms of non-heading chinese cabbage.

materials and methods
sample preparation
the non-heading chinese cabbage accessions nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig> used for expression profiles were cultivated in the field under a non-controlled environment. rna was extracted at the five important plant developmental stages: seedling, rosette, adult, bolting, and flowering. during the first three stages, rna for expression profiles was extracted from leaves. the rna of the bolting stage was extracted from an equal mixture of leaf and buds, while leaves and flowers were used for rna extractions during flowering. all the rna was extracted in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for the rneasy plant mini kit .

digital gene expression tag profiling
the expression levels of genes for the three accessions at the five development stages were obtained using digital gene expression-tag profiling methods, as in a previous report  <cit> . the number of times that a unique tag sequence was detected represents the quantitative expression of the corresponding transcript in tissues.

the bowtie program  was used to map sequencing reads to the non-heading chinese cabbage genome  <cit> . finally, high quality clean tags were compared with the genome sequences of non-heading chinese cabbage and the expression level of each gene was quantified as tpm  <cit> .

to evaluate the mrna expression characteristics, we analyzed the tpm of each identified gene. the highly expressed genes  accounted for >50% of the total expression tags from all genes  in the nhcc <dig> accession. the number of genes with a tpm <  <dig> was ~55% of all genes, while the number of genes with a tpm >  <dig> only accounted for ~10% of all genes . statistical analysis of the other two accessions showed similar patterns, illustrating that most genes were expressed at a low level, and only a handful of genes expressed at high levels accounted for the majority of tag reads. this is in accord with the heterogeneous and redundant features of mrna expression.

we also performed saturation analyses of sequencing data. the data show that the more sequencing tags that a gene had, the more likely it was to be expressed in a certain range. when the number of tags reached a threshold, the number of expressed genes approached saturation. our analysis shows that the number of expressed genes was nearly saturated when tag number was > <dig> million . the lowest number of tags obtained in our study was  <dig>  million for the rosette stage of nhcc <dig>  therefore, our sequencing reads had reached saturation for all the sample stages, assuring that most of the expressed genes during plant growth and development were detected in our study.

identification of degs
the degs were identified mainly as previously described  <cit> . the expressed genes were identified using ideg <dig> software  <cit> , and a general chi-squared test was used to test the hypothesis. the false discovery rate was used to correct the p-value  <cit> , and the fold changes were also calculated for identification of the differentially expressed genes. to avoid the potential noise signal from high-throughput sequencing, absolute fold change ≥ <dig>  and a false discovery rate < <dig>  were used to define the degs, including the upregulated and downregulated genes. the differential expression levels of the genes at the five stages of the three accessions were compared and visualized through scatter plots drawn by perl scripts, and their expression pattern was displayed using the heatmap function in the cluster program  and visualized using tree view software   <cit> . an interaction network of the degs was constructed using cytoscape software  according to the expression level of the genes  <cit> . the numbers of specific and common degs were plotted using the venn diagram function in the r software package  <cit> .

plant materials, growth conditions, and stress treatments
to verify the two candidate cold-related genes, the non-heading chinese cabbage cultivar ‘suzhouqing’  was used for quantitative real-time pcr. seeds were grown in pots containing a soil: vermiculite  mixture in a controlled-environment growth chamber programmed for 16/8 h at 25/20°c for day/night, relative humidity of 55-60%. at the rosette stage, they were transferred to growth chambers set at 4°c under the same light intensity and day length as the cold treatments. the leaf samples were collected at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h after cold treatment. at the same time for acclimation, some plants were cultured in 1/ <dig> hoagland’s solution in plastic containers, with ph at  <dig> . after 5 days of acclimatization, plants were cultured in  <dig> μМ abscisic acid, 10% polyethylene glycol, or left untreated. leaf samples were collected  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h after these treatments and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°c until further analysis.

rna isolation and quantitative real-time pcr analysis
total rna was isolated from leaves using an rna kit  in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. the rna was reverse transcribed into cdna using the prime script rt reagent kit . the actin gene  was used as an internal control to normalize the expression level of the target gene among different samples  <cit> . the specific primers were designed according to the target gene sequences by primer  <dig>  software . quantitative real-time pcr assays were performed with three biological and three technical replicates. each reaction was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing diluted cdna as template, sybr premix ex taq  , and gene-specific primers. quantitative real-time pcr was performed using myiq single-color real-time pcr detection system  with the following cycling profile: 94°c for 30 s, and then 40 cycles at 94°c for 10 s, 58°c for 30 s, and then a melting curve  was generated to check the specific amplification. the relative quantitative method was employed to analyze the relative gene expression level. rna levels were expressed relative to that of the actin gene  as 2–ΔΔct, where ct is the cycle threshold, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> .

functional annotation and pathway analysis
the annotations of degs in non-heading chinese cabbage were obtained by searching the protein databases iprscan , uniprotkb   <cit> , trembl   <cit> , go   <cit> , and kegg   <cit>  and the annotations obtained from these five protein databases were integrated using perl script. in addition, the biological processes and functions of degs were analyzed using the cog   <cit> , and go databases. the cog database represents major phylogenetic lineages, and each cog consists of individual proteins or groups of paralogs from at least  <dig> lineages.

mapping differentially expressed genes on the draft genome
the distribution of all predicted genes, expressed genes, and differentially expressed genes on chromosomes were visualized using perl scripts, and differently colored lines represented each gene dataset. the orthologous and paralogous genes were identified using orthomcl software   <cit> , and the copy number of these genes was calculated using perl scripts. the syntenic relationships between species was constructed by mcscan   <cit> . the all-against-all blastp comparison provided the e-value and the pairwise gene information for protein clustering. paired segments were extended by identifying clusters of genes. this method was used to build the genome synteny blocks of non-heading chinese cabbage compared with heading chinese cabbage and arabidopsis. furthermore, we filtered the synteny blocks that had < <dig> genes to obtain improved collinear analysis. finally, the degs that were located in the synteny blocks were marked according to the physical position, and the collinear blocks plus the marked degs were plotted using perl scripts.
