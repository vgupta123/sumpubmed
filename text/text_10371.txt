BACKGROUND
polarized extension of the pollen tube to deliver twin sperm cells to the female gametophyte is a fundamental process required for successful sexual reproduction and preservation of the floristic dominance of flowering plants. understanding sexual reproduction is at the forefront of plant research and has benefited immensely from the development of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics techniques in recent decades. advances in microarray technology and development of gene chips for arabidopsis, rice and other species have allowed studies on large-scale transcriptional profiling from diverse tissues, which has emerged as a key tool for identification of novel targets for functional genomics.

as in other angiosperms, the tobacco  male gametophyte is formed within the anthers following meiotic division of the archesporial sporophytic cells to produce haploid microspores  <cit> . thereafter, only two mitotic divisions occur. the first pollen mitosis  involves division of the haploid microspore to produce a gametic germ cell and a vegetative cell. these two cell types differ not only in the quantity and diversity of expressed transcripts  <cit> , but also, crucially, in their fate. whereas after pollen tube germination the germ cell undergoes a second mitotic division  to produce two male gametes , the vegetative cell adopts a different fate and acquires the critical task of ensuring growth of the pollen tube. at the stigma surface, the pollen tube germinates and penetrates the female stylar tissues to deliver the two sperm cells to the proximity of the egg and central cell for double fertilization. among flowering plants, the production of sperm cells after pollen germination represents the ancestral pattern. however, over 30% of angiosperms, including arabidopsis thaliana, complete the second division before pollen maturation  <cit> . no explanation has been proposed for the mechanisms that have imposed this regulon prompting differential timing in sperm cell proliferation in the male gametophyte of seed plants, nor have the evolutionary benefits of early gamete production been elucidated. independent analysis of sperm cell dna content revealed five patterns of sperm-cell development that differ with respect to relative timing of sperm-cell formation and maturation prior to fusion with the female gametes  <cit> .

pollen-tube germination represents a unique cellular phenomenon. the pollen tube grows through the female tissues in a polarized fashion similar to root-hair outgrowth, trichome specification, hyphal growth in fungi and extension of neuronal dendrites in the animal nervous system  <cit> . thus, common factors are likely to be involved in the raw molecular cascades that initiate and control the single cell-tip expansion and morphogenesis, which are subsequently modulated by cell- or tissue-specific morphological demands. studies using pollen tubes and root hairs as model systems have revealed a number of signaling molecules and regulatory pathways that promote and maintain the tip-growth characteristic. recently, a study by qin et al.  <cit>  revealed a specific subset of genes that are induced in pollen tubes during growth through the pistil, but not when grown in vitro. among this set of genes are potential receptor proteins that may respond to female cues for guidance of the pollen-tube tip growth. collectively, these experiments demonstrated the direct dependence of cell-tip expansion on polarized exocytosis of vesicles at the apical growth region of the cell. vesicular trafficking to the tip region is a structural requirement for tip growth and plays a significant role in feedback regulation of the tip-localized signaling to maintain the apical cell expansion  <cit> .

until recently, no major studies had analyzed the bicellular pollen transcriptome, with the sole exception of soybean   <cit> . a first glimpse into the tobacco pollen transcriptome was reported by xin and co-workers  <cit> , who constructed an est library from isolated tobacco sperm cells. this project aimed to identify proteins involved in sperm-egg recognition and fusion and identified over  <dig>  est sequences distributed in more than  <dig>  clusters. this analysis discovered paternal candidate genes that could play a role during fertilization and in the early stages of embryogenesis. however, the sperm cell transcriptome alone represents only a small proportion of the total pollen-expressed transcripts and, although est sequencing is sensitive, it provides only a limited list of expressed genes and thus minimizes comprehensive functional downstream analyses  <cit> .

in the present study, we capitalized on the recent development of the agilent  <dig> k tobacco microarray to present the first insight into tobacco pollen and pollen-tube transcriptomes, which represents a contrary experimental model from the tricellular pollen of arabidopsis to a bicellular model of scientific, medical and commercial interest. in addition to broad-spectrum gene expression profiling, we performed a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of tobacco pollen tubes and arabidopsis root-hair trichoblasts  <cit>  to uncover common pathways involved in polar cell expansion. to investigate their potential role in tobacco pollen-tube growth, we used gene ontology  tools to allocate their biological roles, and applied an antisense-transfection approach to verify the function of selected candidate genes.

we further explored our data set to elucidate the control of male germ-cell proliferation and sperm-cell formation from a molecular perspective. in angiosperms, heterochronic alterations in cell cycle activity led to the developmental shift in the timing of germ-cell division and resulted in diversified patterns of spermatogenesis and gamete fusion during fertilization  <cit> . to elucidate the genetic network responsible for this shift among angiosperms, we investigated the expression of core cell-cycle repressors and activators at five stages of pollen development--namely, mature pollen and in vitro-germinated pollen tubes grown for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h - following completion of the germ cell mitotic division. on the basis of these results, we postulated a genetic model in which the male germ cell-cycle progression is coordinated with 'time to fertilization'.

the tobacco pollen and pollen-tube gene expression profiles generated in this study together with our analyses provide an ideal platform for future research into aspects of polarized cell expansion and control of spermatogenesis. in addition, cataloguing the expressed genes will provide an opportunity for development of gametophytic fluorescent markers with which cell behaviour and cell fate can be studied. the present study represents a step towards a comprehensive understanding of male gametogenesis, knowledge of which will provide an effective framework to improve current farming and breeding programs to sustain food requirements and for investigation of tobacco health implications.

RESULTS
application of the agilent  <dig> k tobacco microarray to the nicotiana tabacum male gametophyte transcriptome
in an effort to understand the diversity of gene expression accompanying bicellular tobacco pollen maturation and transcriptional changes with progamic phase induction, we applied tobacco microarray technology  and performed comparative microarray analysis at two time points of male gametophyte development: mature pollen grains , and in vitro-germinated pollen tubes grown for  <dig> h . tobacco mature pollen is bicellular when shed , and is predicted to have a unique set of transcripts that are over- and under-represented in reference to phylogenetically advanced tricellular pollen. pollen tubes grown for  <dig> to  <dig> h in vitro were used to verify the microarray expression by real-time quantitative rt-pcr  and to establish expression patterns of core cell-cycle regulators . two other tissue samples - leaves  and roots with substantial root-hair outgrowth  - were used as sporophytic references. the pollen grains were collected from tobacco plants grown in an outdoor greenhouse, so we investigated the possible effect of variable weather conditions on pollen-tube germination. overall, no significant variation in pollen-tube germination rate or length throughout the harvesting period was observed .

normalized expression values  were used to perform cross-tissue comparisons for identification of preferentially expressed genes. to test the quality of the arrays, we stringently assessed our data sets to justify their reproducibility among replicates, and thus provide a feasible comparison between individual tissues. we used principal component analysis  and independently applied hierarchical clustering to visualize the relationship among the tissues as well as between biological replicates. the uniqueness of gametophyte versus sporophyte gene expression profiles was verified, together with the reproducibility between sample replicates . scatterplots were used to visualize the distribution of p-values for individual probes relative to each other and in relation to the mean expression values. a close relationship between replicates and among tissues of similar origin was observed, whereas great variability in relation to disparate tissues was verified . intensity-dependent-ratio  -derived values of array-array intensity independently supported the intra- and inter-relationships observed. overall, the obtained normalized expression arrays were confirmed as being of good quality for downstream comparison.

we selected nine candidate genes to verify their microarray expression profiles by real-time qrt-pcr at the two developmental stages used for microarray analysis  and extended the analysis to three developmental stages post-pmii . for all genes tested, with the exception of rab gtpase and wd <dig> motif-containing protein , qrt-pcr profiles corresponded to those of the microarray . the extended analysis of post-pmii stages provided additional information not obtained by microarrays to understand gene expression and mrna stability in relation to gene function in the course of pollen-tube extension.

comparative analysis of the tobacco male gametophyte and sporophyte transcriptomes
soma-derived tissues constitute a transcriptome that is distinct from that of gametophytes, and thus provide a good reference point to classify genes that are preferentially expressed in the male gametophyte. for systematic comparison of the four tissue samples, only a subset of reliably expressed genes were considered for analysis . on the basis of this criterion,  <dig>  probes from mpg ,  <dig>  from pt <dig> ,  <dig>  from l  and  <dig>  from r  were selected and classified as reliably expressed. a previous analysis of the tobacco transcriptome that utilized  <dig> k custom-designed affymetrix microarrays reported reliable expression of 76% of the probe sets in  <dig> different tobacco tissues, including leaves and roots  <cit> . we examined the extent of overlap between individual arrays. as anticipated, mpg shared the greatest number of expressed genes with pt <dig> in comparison with leaves or roots . the inverse was true between the sporophytic tissues, with >  <dig>   transcripts being exclusive to the sporophyte and shared between leaves and roots . a detailed examination at the biological significance of these co-expressed genes is discussed below.

when the average of the eight arrays were combined into sporophyte and gametophyte 'master lists' of expressed genes, the reduced complexity of the gametophyte was apparent, with  <dig>  probes  putatively male gametophyte-specific and active in at least one developmental stage. this was significantly less than the analogous value for genes exclusive to sporophytes . the contribution of both mpg and pt <dig> to the male gametophyte-specific subset was similar, with only  <dig> and  <dig> probes exclusive to mpg and pt <dig>  respectively . this marginal, but significant, change in the pollen-tube transcriptome signified a subtle difference with respect to the diversity of the two transcriptomes and a less significant induction of newly transcribed genes on initiation of the progamic phase. our results coincide with changes in gene expression observed in arabidopsis pollen and pollen-tube transcriptomes  <cit> , which emphasized that regulation of overall gene expression is similar in species with bicellular and tricellular pollen.

gene enrichment analysis provides valuable information for prediction of biological functions of gene subsets and dominant pathways imposed in the tissue of interest. we applied a statistical t-test on the quantile-normalized log2-transformed array data and selected only genes that fulfilled the following criteria: for a gene to have undergone a significant change in expression, a probe must have  a p-value ≤  <dig> ;  passed a false discovery rate  correction to minimize the fdr  <cit> ;  an absolute expression signal  of ≥  <dig> ; and  expression levels of >  <dig> . a moderate number of genes  had undergone a significant change in expression between mpg and pt <dig> . interestingly, the mpg transcriptome was  <dig> % and  <dig> % less diverse than the pt <dig> transcriptome with respect to changes in gene expression when compared with leaves and roots, respectively . for other pairwise analyses, see additional files 5: table s <dig>  additional files 6: table s <dig>  additional files 7: table s <dig>  additional files 8: table s <dig>  additional files 9: table s <dig> 

we determined whether any go terms were significantly over-represented among the gametophytic preferentially expressed genes compared with those of the sporophytes. the over-represented go terms in the gametophyte included those related to localization , transporter and structural molecule activities , as well as membrane-enclosed lumen  . the go categories related to transporter activities , calmodulin binding  and the macromolecular complex  were among the most over-represented in mature pollen compared with pollen tubes . over-representation of these categories in mature pollen, particularly calmodulin protein binding  <cit> , may facilitate pollen competence in preparation for initial phases of pollen-tube germination.

pollen-tube transcriptome shares a distinct set of genes with roots and root hairs
the characteristic tip growth of a pollen tube shows a common physiology with other polar-growing tissues such as root hairs, trichomes and neuronal axons in animals  <cit> . we investigated the extent of overlap with the list of genes from arabidopsis that were either functionally verified to be critical for root-hair development or conferred putative root-hair-specific cis-elements  within their promoters  <cit> , and references therein]. these motifs were defined by combination of in silico  and experimental screens that produced an initial list of  <dig> genes with the consensus rhe element  <cit> . although this list was derived from a root-hair-specific transcriptome, the role of the identified genes was not necessarily confined to root-hair morphogenesis. we extended our analysis with the compilation of cvrčková et al.  <cit> , who gathered a list of genes that had either a root-hair-defective phenotype, root-hair-specific expression and/or were known to have a role in pollen-tube tip growth. this accounted for  <dig> genes in total  <cit> .

first, we identified genes that overlapped between pt <dig> and the root transcriptomes of the present study and compiled a set of  <dig>  genes . to obtain a meaningful and direct evaluation of common pathways involved in tip growth, the pt4r list was filtered further to leave genes with closest arabidopsis homologs only  . we designated this subset as pt4r_ath .

the pt4r_ath subset was used to screen for overlap with the root-hair transcriptome and proteome  <cit> . we detected  <dig> genes  from the  <dig> rhe-patched genes that overlapped with the tobacco pt4r_ath transcriptome, and an additional  <dig> genes  from the list of cvrčková et al. collectively, this represented  <dig> genes . additional genes with a known function in tip growth were manually selected either without a significant arabidopsis homolog and/or their expression was confined to  <dig> h pollen tubes  . our approach led to identification of genes with a known function in pollen-tube and/or root-hair-cell expansion, as well as novel targets that potentially could play a significant role in polarized cell growth. several specific targets emerged including: a wd- <dig> repeat family protein; a rac gtpase activating protein; a microtubule motor protein; a cbs domain-containing protein; translation initiation factor 5a ; replication factor c <dig> ; members of the villin and fibrin protein families; and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase  <dig> .

to emphasize molecular networks that facilitate polar cell expansion, we investigated go categories over- or under-represented in the subset of  <dig> pollen-tube/root-hair overlapping genes. we identified  <dig> over-represented go terms, including those associated with transport, cellular component organization, response to stimulus, and nutrient reservoir activity, whereas the go term 'binding'  was under-represented . highly over-represented subcategories included those associated with chromatin modification , translation , protein transport and turnover , cis- and trans-golgi networks, retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, and genes associated with gtpase activities , signal transduction , microtubule and cytoskeleton organization , and cell fate and cell morphogenesis . several of the identified go terms have been implicated in pollen-tube and root-hair polarized growth  <cit> . in particular, genes involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription, signal transduction and transport previously were reported to be over-represented in pollen tubes that had grown semi-in vivo through the pistil and could thus mediate pollen-tube growth and guidance through the style  <cit> .

functional verification of pollen-tube and root-hair overlapping candidate genes using a reverse genetic approach
five candidate proteins were selected for functional analysis on the basis of their expression profile, go category, relevance and novelty. three candidates were identified among go categories over-represented in the overlap between the pollen-tube and root-hair transcriptomes: cu/zn superoxide dismutase  <dig> ; replication factor c <dig> ; and wd- <dig> containing protein pd <dig> . the fourth candidate, ntp <dig> , was selected as the most abundant tobacco pollen-tube wall glycoprotein  <cit>  that is massively translated throughout pollen-tube growth  <cit>  and with predicted important function. finally, eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif5a  was selected as a constitutively expressed protein and a component of the translation machinery during pollen-tube growth.

we used the transfection reagent cytofectin  <cit>  to feed growing pollen tubes with antisense oligonucleotides designed against a target gene. transfection techniques and microinjection for the introduction of antisense oligonucleotides as well as sirnas mimic the transfection of c. elegans and mammalian cell lines with rna interference  sequences  <cit> . the techniques have been used to demonstrate gene function in tobacco and lily pollen tubes  <cit> .

transfection with anti-eif5a and anti-ntp <dig> does not impair pollen-tube growth
eukaryotic translation initiation and elongation factors have been implemented in various cellular processes, including cell division, cell growth and cell death  <cit> , as well as in plant response to iron deficiency  <cit> ; eif5a served as a general, non-specific control. no significant difference in pollen-tube length or morphology was observed between wild-type sense- or antisense-transfected pollen tubes after  <dig> h of pollen-tube cultivation . with reference to pollen germination dependency on translation  <cit> , we propose a likely redundancy with other translation initiation factors.

the rapid extension of the growing pollen tube is predetermined by the biosynthesis and delivery of pollen tube wall material. ntp <dig> encodes a 69-kda glycoprotein  <cit>  assigned a putative function as copper ion oxidoreductase  with predicted localization in the vacuole and chloroplast , with a probability of being extracellular . our attempt to deplete ntp <dig> gene expression with antisense oligonucleotide transfection resulted in no apparent perturbation of pollen-tube growth or any pleiotropic morphological defects  .

anti-pd <dig> induced knockdown displayed severe pollen-tube growth arrest
we investigated the putative role of bp <dig> , here annotated as pd <dig> , a wd- <dig> containing protein with predicted nuclear localization . wd- <dig> domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate key developmental processes  <cit> . transfection of germinating pollen grains with pd40-antisense oligonucleotides severely perturbed pollen-tube growth . on average, 36% of pd <dig> antisense-treated pollen tubes were significantly shorter  than the average length of the wild-type or sense-treated pollen tubes . apart from stunted growth, no other morphological abnormalities were observed. recently, the role of wd- <dig> proteins as substrate receptors for cul4-ring e <dig> ubiquitin ligases has been demonstrated in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . to date, a stand-alone model that involves wd- <dig> proteins is that of root-hair and trichome specification composed of a wd- <dig> protein transparent testa glabra <dig> , bhlh transcription factor glabra <dig>  and two myb proteins, werewolf  and caprice , that together impose position-dependent patterning of root-hair specification  <cit> . our observation places an emphasis on the significance of protein turnover and recycling during polarized cell growth.

csd <dig> deficiency exhibits a complete block of pollen-tube extension as well as pollen-tube tip morphology
to determine whether our overlapping candidates with predicted role in the regulation of reactive oxygen species  also play a role in tip growth, we investigated csd <dig>  an apoprotein of cu-zn superoxide dismutase with a known function in ros detoxification  <cit> . recently, csd <dig> was demonstrated to be regulated by mir <dig> at the transcription and translation levels in response to copper availability  <cit> . we established that csd <dig> is cytosol-localized . antisense knockdown of csd <dig> resulted in stunted pollen tubes with an average length of  <dig> μm, which was significantly shorter than that of control samples  . approximately 33% of the population displayed the aberrant pollen-tube phenotype . a small proportion of the pollen tubes  showed abnormal swollen tips that were not observed in csd1-sense transfected pollen tubes nor in wild-type pollen tubes . the influence of ros dynamics on pollen-tube tip morphology has been demonstrated repeatedly and has conclusively highlighted the function of ros at the apical dome of the germinating pollen tube  <cit> . our discovery that depletion of csd <dig> compromises pollen-tube growth further extends our knowledge of polar cell expansion, and it is likely to have a similar role during root-hair specification and morphogenesis.

ntrfc <dig> knockdown induces partial block of pollen-tube germination
the dna replication factor c <dig>  ntrfc <dig>  mediates genomic stability and transcriptional gene silencing in arabidopsis  <cit> . ntrfc <dig> was predicted to localize in the nucleus . pollen germination in the presence of ntrfc1-antisense oligonucleotides for  <dig> h resulted in pollen-tube extension defects in which  <dig> % of the total population had an average length of  <dig> μm, which was significantly on the dwarf side  . in the most severe scenario,  <dig> %  of the pollen tubes showed almost complete arrest in germination. interestingly, the proportion of defective pollen tubes was enhanced at a higher concentration of ntrfc1-antisense oligonucleotides .

the remaining candidates are of considerable interest for further functional analysis to understand the molecular basis that governs pollen-tube tip growth, pollen tube-pistil interaction, signaling and guidance.

genes with a demonstrated or potential role in cell-cycle repression are dominant in mature pollen and  <dig> h pollen tubes
we used mapman software http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman <cit>  to extract a cluster of genes classified as regulators of cell division and cell-cycle progression. we limited our analysis to genes reliably detected in both replicates and with expression levels well above the background. thirty-seven genes were grouped with a role in cell-cycle progression, whereas  <dig> genes were annotated to participate in some aspects of cell division . we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to validate the expression of selected target genes and to extend the analysis post-pmii after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of pollen-tube growth . the sample selection allowed us to establish the expression dynamics of these key cell-cycle regulators pre- and post-pmii in angiosperms with bicellular pollen.

reduced accumulation of cell-cycle repressors implies derepression and mitotic entry of the germ cell
quantification of dna content in bicellular pollen indicated that the progression of the germ cells requires cell-cycle arrest or slow progression through the s-phase immediately after the first haploid division of the microspore until the entry into pmii, 8- <dig> h after pollen germination  <cit> . our analysis revealed a dominant presence of known cell-cycle inhibitors at the mature pollen stage that persisted into  <dig> h pollen tubes . these inhibitors included a retinoblastoma protein  <dig> , two inhibitory kinases of cyclin-dependent kinases--namely, kip-related proteins  <dig> and  <dig> --as well as del <dig> and pas <dig>  we previously demonstrated the essential role of rbr <dig> in blocking s-phase entry of the vegetative-cell nucleus and linked this later role with an earlier function of specifying cell fate of the vegetative cell and the germ cell in the arabidopsis male gametophyte  <cit> . our present results showed that rbr <dig> transcripts are highly abundant at the mature pollen stage. its expression is reduced after  <dig> h pollen-tube growth and remained at steady-state levels up to  <dig> h pollen tubes . similarly, krp6/ <dig> are known inhibitors of germ-cell-cycle progression in arabidopsis and their repression activities are suppressed by an f-box protein, fbl <dig>  <cit> . in the present study we detected two members from the krp family, krp <dig> and krp <dig>  with opposed expression profiles. whereas krp <dig> showed high abundance in mature pollen that dramatically declined thereafter up to the  <dig> h time point of pollen-tube growth , krp <dig> showed very low expression throughout development before significantly peaking in  <dig> h pollen tubes .

transition to cell-cycle progression is achieved by blocking the activities of the cell-cycle repressors. a family of f-box proteins, components of the skp1-cul1-f-box protein complex , is known to counteract the repression of cdka induced by krp proteins. we detected the expression of five f-box-like genes . semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed that the expression of fbl <dig> and fbl <dig> peaked at the 'division window' followed by a rapid decline post-pmii . we also detected expression of apc <dig>  a component of the anaphase-promoting complex  involved in the turnover of cyclin subunits through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cyclin proteins to prevent premature entry and to promote exit from the mitotic cycle. recent genetic characterization of another apc/c component, apc <dig>  has linked apc activities to the transcriptional repression of cycb1; <dig> by activation of a repressor of duo pollen  <dig>  mir <dig>  <cit> . our analysis showed that apc <dig> expression levels were reduced until pt <dig>  and then increased significantly to maximum levels at the  <dig> h time point . this observation points to the dual role of apc/c in the germ cell cycle, in which cyclinb <dig> transcriptional repression is coupled with ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the male gametophyte.

a significant peak of g2/m factors marks transition to activation and germ-cell mitotic division
the dormant state of the mitotic cell cycle in  <dig> h pollen tubes was further emphasized by the under-representation of known cell-cycle activators. a g2/m master regulator, cycb1; <dig>  was only unreliably detected in mature pollen and  <dig> h pollen tubes . inversely, at the transition to the second mitotic division of the germ cell , cycb1; <dig> expression was specifically and dramatically enhanced at the 'division window'  and maintained its status before gradually decreasing thereafter . we also detected two myb transcription activators of cycb1; <dig> expression: ntmyba <dig>  and a putative tobacco ortholog of arabidopsis duo pollen <dig> , here annotated as ntduo1-like   <cit> , e-value of 1e-78). the tobacco ntmyba <dig> is a r1r2r <dig> myb transcription factor similar to animal c-myb proteins that induce cycb1; <dig> expression specifically at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . the role of ntmyba <dig> in the activation of cycb1; <dig> is enhanced specifically at g2/m by tcp <dig>  a teosinte-branched cycloidea pcna factor, through binding on enhancer elements  within cycb1; <dig> promoter sequences  <cit> . duo <dig>  on the other hand, is an r2r <dig> myb transcription factor that we previously demonstrated to be a dual regulator of germ-cell division and sperm cell fate differentiation  <cit> . all three factors, ntmyba <dig>  ntduo1-like and tcp <dig>  were gradually enhanced, and simultaneously peaked at the 'division window', which mirrored the profile of their target  and the cell-cycle status of the germ cell . remarkably, the expression of these mitotic entry gate-keepers reached a maximum level at the  <dig> h time point, by which time > 80% of the germ cells are in the transition through mitosis or had completed mitotic division to produce the two sperm cells .

the stable presence of other key positive regulators, such as cdka; <dig>  cdkb1; <dig> , and cdkb2; <dig> , appears to provide a positive balance and a molecular switch preset to enter and progress through the cell division cycle . we observed a marginal increase in expression of cdka; <dig> and cdkb1; <dig> from mature pollen to pt <dig> preceding the strong expression of cycb1; <dig> . their expression was stabilized thereafter throughout the progression of the progamic phase.

sperm cell fate specification markers continuously accumulate pre- and post-division of the germ cell
the coupling of the germ-cell mitotic division with sperm cell fate specification is designated by the overlapping expression of known cell fate differentiation markers within the germ cell that progresses to the newly formed sperm cells. we showed previously that duo <dig> integrated both events, which enabled germ-cell division and regulation of the transcription of a repertoire of sperm-cell differentiation markers  <cit> . in this study, we detected  <dig> tobacco homologs of arabidopsis duo1-induced targets including two verified targets . among these homologs is a chromatin remodelling protein , wd- <dig> cul4-ring ubiquitin ligase , a zinc finger family protein , duo <dig> activated unknown protein , a nac domain-containing protein  <dig> , a sugar transporter , and a heavy-metal-associated domain-containing protein . given the demonstrated role of duo <dig>  these genes are also likely to be regulators of sperm cell fate specification in tobacco. we verified expression of four candidates and established that c3hc <dig>  chr <dig> and grf <dig> showed similar abundance and expression profiles, whereas daw <dig> peaked at pt <dig> and dropped to comparable levels thereafter . additional target genes are almost certainly expressed in the tobacco male gametophyte and might play a more conserved role to that in arabidopsis, including the determination of sperm cell fate and function.

in summary, our analysis of male gametophyte development pre- and post-second haploid mitosis uncovered an alternating accumulation of conserved regulators of cell proliferation and cell fate determinants in synchrony with the progression of the germ cell cycle. their activities are the likely cause of the heterochronic shift that has led to diversified patterns of spermatogenesis and gamete fusion among angiosperms.

discussion
with continuous improvement in gene annotation and the availability of functional analysis tools, nicotiana tabacum has emerged as a'practical' experimental model for investigation of gene function, particularly of genes involved in pollen-tube growth and fertilization. thus, our data set offers new opportunities for cross-species functional studies - for example, extended studies of lily gcs <dig>  <cit>  in organisms with advanced genomic information available, such as arabidopsis and rice. although markedly improved, incomplete genome annotation in solanaceae species has remained a drawback for research on these plants.

comparative analysis of pollen-tube and root-hair transcriptomes provides insight into the genetic network of cell tip expansion and morphogenesis
we identified a suite of genes from a global-comparative analysis of pollen-tube and root-hair transcriptomes, with the implication of uncovering the genetic network involved in the control of tip-growth morphogenesis. of the genes identified ,  <dig> go categories were classified as highly over-represented , which included those associated with chromatin modification, transcription and translation, protein transport and turnover, cis- and trans-golgi networks, retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, signal transduction, microtubule and cytoskeleton organization, cell fate and cell morphogenesis, and cell and cell-wall metabolic processes. several genes emerged from the identified go categories were functionally characterized previously. these include two transcription factors - npr1-like protein  <dig>  and rap <dig>   - that are implicated in defence responses and enhanced adh <dig> transcription and enzyme activities  <cit> , respectively. using the pollen tube as a model for functional tests, we verified the function of three candidate genes and illustrated their role in pollen-tube tip growth . our results demonstrated that copper metabolism , chromatin remodelling , and regulated ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  are essential processes during pollen-tube extension. similarly, recently published analyses of f-box proteins skip <dig>  and lsk1-lsk <dig>  also demonstrated the importance of 26s proteasome-mediated proteolysis during pollen-tube extension  <cit> . furthermore, expression 'late genes' is known to persist at a certain rate during pollen germination  <cit> . ntrfc <dig> has been implemented in maintaining genome stability and transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> , and thus could function to repress the expression of germ-cell genes within the vegetative cell and simultaneously to regulate the tobacco germ-cell chromatin status. the concept of the two cell types sharing resources and regulatory molecules through cytoplasmic bridging potentially to implement synchronized control during maturation is increasingly apparent, although it has yet to be demonstrated at the molecular level  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated the essential role of ntrfc <dig> as a component of the gene expression network in association with pollen-tube tip expansion.

we acknowledge that our approach could have been too stringent on selection criteria and resulted in potential candidate losses. for instance, three genes - jackdaw , ctr <dig> and axr <dig> - are essential components of the genetic network that regulates root-hair-cell specification and extension  <cit> , but their expression in our data set was classified as unreliable, most likely because of their low expression levels. on the other hand, the identification of genes such as gnom-like  <dig> , a key component of pollen-tube tip-defining growth  <cit>  in the tobacco pollen-tube transcriptome, further endorsed our selection criteria. we simultaneously detected cyclophilin  <dig> , dv <dig>  which is known to interact with gnom in vitro  <cit> . moreover, our identification was not only limited to cell-fate-specification genes, but also included genes required for the proper expansion of most cell types, such as members of the root-hair defective  <dig> gtp-binding  protein family   <cit> . our data offer further extension to investigate the control of tip specification, initiation and expansion, and provide a platform by which microarray-directed reverse genetic analysis can be used to enhance our understanding of polarized cell expansion.

the key question remains how these genes reprogram pollen-grain polarity in response to hydration to mediate the point of progamic phase initiation and pollen-tube growth through its multiple phases within the female transmitting tissues. this comparative approach supports the idea that, by investigation of the genetic overlap between polarized pollen tubes and roots/root hairs, it is more than likely to uncover universal mechanisms employed to promote tip expansion in order to achieve the intended morphological structure and cell function.

lack of phenotypic defects following ntp <dig> knockdown suggests existence of robust backup for key regulators of pollen-tube growth
the ntp <dig> glycoprotein is the most abundant protein in  <dig> h pollen tubes  <cit>  and is a major component of the pollen tube wall  <cit> . previous attempts to knockdown ntp <dig> expression in planta using an rnai vector did not alter pollen development or pollen-tube growth. however, targeting ntp <dig> family members  simultaneously produced male-sterile plants that showed pollen-tube growth defects in vivo but not in vitro  <cit> . this observation led to the hypothesis that ntp <dig> could  facilitate pollen-tube growth through the style, and hence the effect could only be observed in vivo, although ntp <dig> protein was not detected in transmitting tissues; and/or  participate in pollen-tube wall formation, and thus its knockdown could only result in weak cell-wall formation that is not evident in vitro. in planta and in vitro studies using amino acid microsequencing and immunolocalization approaches reported ntp <dig> protein detection  on vegetative plasma membranes surrounding the vegetative cell, generative cell and sperm cells of pollen and pollen tubes;  in the pollen-tube cell wall and callose plugs; and  in pollen-tube pellet fractions after  <dig> h of pollen tube growth and in cytosol after  <dig> h of pollen tube growth  <cit> . these results strongly suggested that ntp <dig> is translocated to the pollen-tube cell wall/membranes possibly by vesicular trafficking  <cit> . however, ntp <dig> was not detected at the tip of the growing pollen tubes, and thus it is unlikely to be involved in direct signal transduction. on the other hand, it could be part of the intracellular signalling system, because both the gtp-binding site and several possible phosphorylation sites are predicted in addition to transit peptide  <cit> . ntp <dig> is homologous to arabidopsis sku <dig> , a member of the small sks family  that possesses an ascorbate oxidase motif and encodes an extracellular glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein  <cit> . this motif is required for tobacco by <dig> cell expansion, and a sku <dig> mutant displayed growth defects in directional root growth  <cit> . our observation of the lack of pollen-tube defects after transfection with ntp303-antisense oligoneucleotides repeated and independently verified previous observations  <cit> . given that ntp <dig> is the most abundant component of the pollen tube, ntp <dig> mrna distribution into storage compartments  <cit>   and its regulation at the transcription and translation level  <cit> , together with its expression and functional overlap with other family members, might provide a robust 'back-up' to bypass an effect from a 'defective member' and ensure pollen germination and successful fertilization. our current attempt to manipulate ntp <dig> at the protein level appears to be more effective, and thus might be more informative for elucidation of the precise function of ntp <dig> .

determining the conserved pathway of germ cell division and sperm cell differentiation in angiosperms; a genetic model from a cell cycle perspective
limited studies of sperm-cell dna content in developing pollen and in the pollen tube from inception through entry into the embryo sac have been frequently used as the basis for predictions of the expression of cell-cycle-related genes, specifically cdks and cyclins  <cit> . transition through cell cycle phases in plants is primarily controlled, as in yeast and mammals, by the interactions of cdks with the regulatory cyclins subunit. cdka genes are constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle, and they interact with several cyclin proteins to regulate transition through phases of the cell cycle, including the germ cell cycle in arabidopsis  <cit> . plants bearing the cdka; <dig> mutation are occasionally defective in germ-cell division, and thus fail to produce the two sperm cells necessary for the double fertilization  <cit> . we recently showed that the cdka; <dig> single sperm cell is not impaired in the expression of sperm cell fate markers, which is indicative of the competence of the sperm cell produced  <cit> . interestingly, the single sperm cell produced is able to fertilize either of the female gametes and produces equal proportions of seeds with either a single endosperm or single embryo  <cit> . despite the occurrence of double fertilization in the presence of cdka; <dig> sperm cells, the central cells do not undergo karyogamy, which results in impaired endosperm development and eventual seed abortion  <cit> . this lack of nuclear fusion might potentially be because of lack of cell-cycle synchrony between the central cells and the cdka; <dig> sperm cell at the time of karyogamy. cell-cycle checkpoints  are maintained by a repertoire of repressor proteins, including retinoblastoma-related protein , kip-related proteins , and inhibitors of cdks activities . rbr <dig> plays an essential role in the specification of vegetative cell and germ cells and in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> , and has an extended function in the regulation of polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  and methyltransferase  <dig>  in male and female gametophytes  <cit> . activity of these proteins is post-translationally modulated by either phosphorylation or protein turnover, by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis complexes, scf and apc. interestingly, apc <dig> mutation inhibits germ cell division, whereas apc8/apc <dig> hypermorphic lines showed endoreduplication in rosette leaves of arabidopsis thaliana and pleiotropic morphological defects, including small siliques, curled leaves and abnormal phylotaxy  <cit> . our go annotation of cell cycle genes  and semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses  combined with previous knowledge on germ cell-cycle control  <cit>  enabled us to propose a hypothetical genetic model from a tobacco male germ cell-cycle perspective. the proposed model is reminiscent of a biological 'clock' by which male and female gametes synchronize cell-cycle progression and coordinate gametogenesis events for successful fertilization . it not only provides a foundation to understand the molecular basis of the evolution of pollen tricellularity, but also acts as an informative 'genetic map' for experimental models to produce apomorphic tricellular pollen and to inspire current in vitro fertilization protocols to produce hybrid plant species. thus understanding of this regulon could provide a useful tool for plant breeders and conservationists to utilize, either to avoid hybridization or to promote crossing of distantly related plant species that are otherwise separated because of hybrid infertility.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we generated and verified transcriptomic profiles for nicotiana tabacum mature pollen and growing pollen tubes. we functionally demonstrated the role of three pollen-tube-expressed genes in the flawless progression of the progamic phase. we further defined a gene subset, the expression of which overlaps between two tissues characterized by polarised tip growth--namely, pollen tubes and root hairs. we provided additional evidence that knockdown of the tobacco pollen-specific protein ntp <dig> does not cause apparent phenotypic defects and that its function is sufficiently backed up by its related family members. in addition, we demonstrated expression profiles of known cell-cycle regulators in the tobacco male gametophyte and proposed a genetic model that underlines the regulation of cell-cycle progression during haploid pollen mitosis ii as a basis of pollen bicellularity in nicotiana tabacum.

by making the tobacco pollen transcriptomic data publicly accessible, we offer a solid reference benchmark for future transcriptome-based functional studies. the generated transcriptomic data sets have the potential, together with other already available gene expression profiling resources, to provide the foundation for future studies of the evolution of pollen tricellularity, which has occurred independently in several angiosperm lineages. the data sets also inspire development and improvement of current in vitro fertilization protocols that are of great interest not only to plant researchers but also to breeders and conservationists. successful protocols will offer an opportunity to cross and generate hybrid lines that otherwise face cross-compatibility barriers.
