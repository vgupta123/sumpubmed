BACKGROUND
transient transfection is widely used for functional studies on a gene of interest, eg. to study mechanisms regulating gene expression or functions, and cellular localization of its product. however, transfection is not neutral to such experimental models. in our previous studies we found that some transfection agents may induce by themselves the activity of a studied gene  <cit> . moreover, high throughput methods of gene expression analysis revealed that transfection agents may induce not only a gene of interest but also a wide spectrum of other genes  <cit> .

our previous study was aimed to functionally characterize the heat inducible stress gene hspa1b cloned by us from the rat genome . endogenous hspa1b is not transcribed at a physiological temperature. however, it is highly inducible by heat shock and many other harmful factors that cause accumulation of damaged proteins and/or fluidity changes of cellular membranes  <cit> . to analyze the cis-acting elements of hspa1b gene promoter we used transient transfection by deae-dextran method. this method gave reproducible results and a stable and expected pattern of hspa1b promoter activity: undetectable or very low at physiological temperature and highly induced at heat shock temperature. however, with the advent of cationic liposomes, they were recognized as more efficient and more convenient than the previously used transfection agents  <cit> . our attempts to use novel dna carriers resulted in an unexpected finding. indeed, lipofectin had a higher transfection efficiency, but surprisingly it had also a side effect. it appeared that when using this dna carrier the hspa1b promoter contained in the transfected construct was induced and highly active, both under the heat shock conditions and at the physiological temperature  <cit> . similar effects were seen when using lipofectamine  <dig>  to our knowledge, this topic has not been studied since our first account. our current work was aimed to better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon and its potential biological and practical consequences. here we report comparisons of several transfection agents in respect to the described side effect, and our observations concerning the mechanism of transcriptional activation of hspa1b by lipofectin/lipofectamine . in addition, we show the microarray analysis of cellular processes and signalling pathways that are affected in the cells treated with lipofectamine.

RESULTS
the effect of cationic liposomes on hspa1b gene transcription
in a previous study we used lipofectin for transient transfection of b16f <dig> mouse melanoma cells, with a construct containing a egfp reporter gene controlled by the hspa1b gene promoter. surprisingly, we observed the reporter gene activity not only under heat shock conditions but also at the physiological temperature . also, the b16f <dig> cells stably transfected with that construct showed egfp activation when they were treated with lipofectin  <cit> . this effect was observed repeatedly with different batches of the reagent.

for quantitative measurements we used the p950/cat <dig> construct containing the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  reporter gene under the control of hspa1b promoter. we compared transfection efficiency and promoter activity dependence on various dna carriers such as deae-dextran, two home made liposome formulations  along with two commercially available liposome agents, lipofectin and lipofectamine  <dig> . ddab/dope and arg-chol/dope showed efficiency similar to that of deae-dextran . lipofectin showed higher transfection efficiency  while lipofectamine was the most efficient . when cells were transiently transfected with p950/cat <dig> construct using deae-dextran, ddab/dope or arg-chol/dope, they did not exhibit cat activity at 37°c  while at  <dig> °c  they did . this corresponds to the pattern of hspa1b gene activity induced in vivo by heat shock. on the contrary, when la were used for transfections, the hspa1b promoter appeared to be equally active in control and in heat-shocked cells. in some cases cat activity induced by these agents was even stronger at 37°c than under heat shock . this effect did not depend on transfection efficiency. it was observed repeatedly, although its intensity varied slightly between different batches of reagents.

we performed the same experiment using the rat hepatoma fto cell line and observed the same effect of la induced hspa1b promoter activity at the physiological temperature .

in the next step of the study we analyzed the kinetics of promoter activation by la. b16f <dig> cells were transiently transfected with the p950/cat <dig> construct and activity of the reporter gene was assayed at various time points up to  <dig> hours after transfection. in the cells grown at the physiological temperature, a high level of cat activity was detected starting from  <dig> hours post transfection .

induction of transcription does not depend on hse-hsf interaction
ten plasmid constructs  containing the cat gene under the control of different fragments of the hspa1b gene promoter were used in searching for the mechanism responsible for la-induced transcriptional activation. the cat assay results  reflect the complexity of the transcriptional regulation in response to la. the highest cat activity was found with the plasmid p350/cat <dig>  which contains sequences localized between nucleotides - <dig> and + <dig>  relative to the transcription start site of the hspa1b gene. from among known regulatory sequences this dna region contains tata-box, two sp <dig> binding sites, two caat-boxes , egr <dig> binding site and two proximal hse sequences. the promoter fragment crucial for la induction was located between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig>  constructs lacking this dna fragment always had their reporter gene activity reduced almost to the control level . the dna region localized between positions - <dig> and - <dig> confers unknown inhibitory abilities resulting in lower cat activity . interestingly, this inhibition was reversed when the construct was enlarged by the addition of more upstream sequences : cat activity observed after transfection with the plasmids p950/cat <dig> and p <dig> -950/cat <dig> was similar to that achieved with p350/cat <dig> 

it is generally accepted that promoter activation of heat shock genes by different stressful stimuli is mediated by the interaction of heat shock transcription factor  <dig>  with a specific dna sequence called hse   <cit> . to verify whether this mechanism is employed during hspa1b promoter induction by la we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  using the oligonucleotide probe with canonical hse sequence. in contrast to the heat-shocked cells, the nuclear extracts from the lipofectin-treated cells did not exhibit any binding ability for the hse sequence . this indicates that la induction is independent from hse-hsf interaction as well as from any other hse-protein interaction.

the influence of cationic liposomes on global gene expression
inducible hsp <dig> gene expression is a hallmark of cellular stress response. in order to study how lipofection may affect cellular homeostasis we analyzed, using affymetrix microarrays, the whole transcriptome of the mouse b16f <dig> cells treated with lipofectamine. to find out which genes are affected we compared the cells treated with lipofectamine, heat shocked cells and control, untreated cells. all three groups were compared by f-test , then two-way comparisons were carried out. in lipofectamine-treated cells  <dig> probesets  showed significantly changed expression in comparison to the control, untreated cells. a similar number of  <dig> probesets  were affected in heat shocked cells. of these,  <dig> probesets were common for the heat-shocked and lipofectamine-treated cells, all of them showing expression changes in the same direction. lipofectamine induced several heat shock genes: the hspa1b  as well as hsph <dig> , hspa <dig>  and dnajb <dig>  in addition, lipofectamine affected also hspa <dig>  which was the only hsp gene that showed a reduced level of transcription in comparison to the control cells. all these genes, except for the hspa <dig> , were also affected by hyperthermia. an additional five hsp genes were upregulated by heat shock, but not by lipofectamine. the comparison of hsp genes induced by lipofectamine and by heat shock as well as the overall numbers of affected genes are given respectively in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

la - lipofectamine  <dig>  hs - heat shock, "+" - increased expression compared to control, untreated cells, "-" - decreased expression, blank - no change.

la - lipofectamine  <dig>  hs - heat shock, "up" - number of upregulated probesets, "down" - number of downregulated probsets , "both" - number of probsets affected by both factors.

as expected, heat shock caused widespread suppression of genes transcription and specific induction of cytoprotective genes and pro-survival signalling pathways. lipofectamine, despite inducing some stress genes, evoked pro-apototic rather than pro-survival signalling. numerous affected genes were involved in general metabolism, cell cycle control and progression, as well as apoptosis. most significantly downregulated gene ontology classes were those engaged in cell proliferation, viability and metabolism, e.g. classes named "dna-dependent dna replication", "double-strand break repair", "chromosome segregation", "ribosome biogenesis". significantly upregulated were classes such as "regulation of caspase activity", "regulation of peptidase activity" or "stress-activated protein kinase signalling pathway".

promoter analysis of liposome- and heat shock-induced genes
for promoter analysis we used the molecular signatures database, msigdb and its predicted promoter motifs ontology which consists of a sets of genes that share a common transcription factor binding site. analysis showed that among the genes upregulated by lipofectamine, overrepresented were those that contained in their promoters a binding site for serum response factor , eg. egr <dig>  egr <dig>  fos, junb, gadd45g, dnajb <dig>  tle <dig> and dusp <dig>  other promoter sites indicated by this analysis included: a binding site for aryl hydrocarbon receptor , a sequence recognized by microrna mir- <dig> and one motif that does not match any known transcription factor but is present in the promoters of  <dig> genes included in msigdb. in contrast, many more types of regulatory sequences were ascribed to the genes induced by heat shock, including hsf <dig>  hsf <dig>  one uncharacterized motif resembling a hsf-binding element, binding sites for transcription factors tcf <dig>  tcf <dig> and e2f <dig>  as well as for hormone receptors pr and ar and motifs recognized by four micrornas .

discussion
hsp <dig> induction by la - unique observation or universal phenomenon?
although hsp <dig> gene promoter induction by lipofectin or lipofectamine was not reported until our first account  <cit> , the pub med search revealed several examples of similar observations concerning hsp <dig> genes from different species , transfected into different cell types . these observations were, however, overlooked or misinterpreted by the authors. brazolot et al. aimed to establish conditions for efficient lipofection  for two types of chicken cells   <cit> . for this purpose they chose the construct containing lacz reporter gene under the control of murine hsp <dig> promoter. they noticed that expression of this construct did not require induction by heat shock, but they ascribed this effect to the heterology of the experimental model consisting of chicken cells and murine promoter. in our opinion this was the effect of lipofectin-induced hsp promoter activation. in another study, lan and riddiford tried to optimize conditions for transient transfection of embryonic cell line gv <dig> from a moth manduca sexta by comparing polybrene, cellfectin and lipofectin  <cit> . when they used lipofectin  for transfection of the constructs containing drosophila hsp <dig> promoter fused with a lacz or cat gene, they observed constitutive activity of the reporter genes at the physiological temperature. they also noticed higher reporter gene expression in heat shock conditions in the cells transfected by lipofectin than by other transfection agents. both effects were considered a result of higher transfection efficiency achieved with lipofectin. we think that despite possible differences in transfection efficiency, these observations reflect the induction of hsp <dig> promoter by lipofectin. stiles and co-workers transfected hsp70-cat construct to the boll weevil cells using lipofectin  and they noted that, even without heat shock, the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter provided some cat expression up to two days after transfection  <cit> . comparing with the heat shock, the level of cat activity in control cells was rather minimal but it was comparable to the level achieved by cuso <dig> induction.

our data was derived from the studies done on two cell lines  and including hspa1b gene derived from two species . in addition we observed induction of three other hsp genes by lipofectamine in the microarray study. in our opinion, the results of our studies, together with the above-mentioned observations made by others suggest that the phenomenon of hsp <dig> promoter induction by lipofectin may be universal, affecting hsp <dig> genes from different species and occurring in wide range of species and cell types.

not every liposome formulation induces hsp transcription
we have shown that lipofectin and lipofectamine have the same activity toward the rat hspa1b promoter. the hspa1b promoter induction in physiological temperature was observed consistently with both reagents, although the intensity of induction was slightly varying from batch to batch. it seems however that not every cationic liposome formulation induces hsp <dig> promoters. for example, we did not observe hspa1b promoter induction when using laboratory-formulated liposomes ddab/dope and arg-chol/dope  <cit> . also, boulo et al. who used dotap reagent  did not observe induction of the drosophila hsp <dig> gene promoter that had been cloned into the transfected construct. the figure showing reporter gene activity at different temperatures, from 18°c  to 42°c , clearly demonstrated that promoter induction was dependent only on temperature  <cit> . comparison of the composition of different liposomal formulations and their inducing activity suggests that a neutral lipid dope is not engaged. dope was found both in those transfection agents that induce hsp <dig> promoter and those that do not. therefore, the inducing factor must be a cationic liposome component. however, our results and the observations made by others suggest that not every type of cationic liposome formulation induces hsp transcription. in summary, dotma  and dospa  have inducing ability while ddab, arg-chol and dotap are devoid of hsp <dig> inducing activity.

promoter analysis in relation to la induction
the inducible hsp <dig> genes code for evolutionarily conserved proteins that confer cytoprotection against a wide range of stressful factors. their expression is induced by a number of various substances and conditions that lead to aggregation of misfolded proteins and/or to fluidity changes of cellular membranes. transcription of stress inducible hsp <dig> genes is mediated by the hsf <dig> factor that interacts with hse sequence. apart from this interaction, which has been best-studied and considered basic, the expression of hsp <dig> genes may be modulated by other members of hsf family ; rev in:  <cit>  as well as by unrelated transcription factors e.g. sp <dig>  myb, tp <dig>  stat, myc  <cit> .

in this study we identified the minimal dna fragment required for efficient liposome-induced response of hspa1b gene. this dna region  contains two caat-boxes , one sp1/egr <dig> binding site and two hse sequences. according to the results of the emsa experiment, hse sequences are not engaged in la activation. this result was consistent with the results of the microarray experiment and data analysis according to the msigdb, which did not indicate hsf <dig> motif in other la-induced genes. interestingly, this analysis indicated very few regulatory motifs potentially engaged in la stimulation, none of them being present in the analyzed fragment of hspa1b gene. however, when the two-step model of liposome-induced activation is considered, it is possible that early growth response  <dig>  protein that is induced by la could be responsible for hspa1b activation. initially, we also speculated that la induction of hspa1b promoter could be triggered by an alteration of cellular membrane structure. it was shown recently that reorganization of cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains, provoked either by high temperature or benzyl alcohol treatment, induces stress response mediated by the hse-hsf <dig> interaction  <cit> . however, we experimentally excluded hse-hsf <dig> mechanism, thus it seems that membrane perturbations do not play a key role during cellular response to la.

transfection agents may cause widespread transcriptional response
we also got an insight into molecular changes caused by lipofectamine. using dna microarrays we found that in mouse b16f <dig> cells, except several hsp genes, numerous other genes were affected. the majority of them are engaged in vital cellular functions, mostly maintaining cellular metabolism, cell cycle control and progression, and apoptosis. in our opinion, the observed alterations in gene expression profile are consistent with phenotypic changes caused by la in vitro. these agents are cytotoxic and high concentrations or prolonged incubation lead to cell death. the results of our study show that also the apparently non-lethal concentrations trigger cellular alert signals and widespread transcriptional response.

the question of unintended changes in gene expression induced by different dna carriers was also addressed by jacobsen et al.  <cit> . however, their experiment differed from ours, as they transfected a gene of interest while we did only a mock transfection. thus, we observed the changes induced exclusively by a transfection agent while they observed a joint effect of a transfected dna and a dna carrier. probably for this reason they did not analyze the biological effects of each transfection agent. nevertheless, they noticed variable numbers of affected genes, depending on the transfection reagent used. eight hours post transfection these were:  <dig> transcripts in the case of fugene hd ,  <dig> transcripts for effectene ,  <dig> transcripts for lipofectamine ltx used with plus reagent  and  <dig> transcripts for lipofectamine  <dig>  . after  <dig> hours there were:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> affected genes respectively for the aforementioned transfection agents. the authors emphasize that, except for biologically relevant changes caused by the gene of interest, they observed both universal cellular response to the foreign dna and a differential effect of each transfection agent. thus, by employing microarray technique, which has a high throughput and is a highly sensitive method, it is possible to measure widespread changes in global gene expression, caused by transfection agents. this may be of particular importance when searching for gene function through transient overexpression or silencing.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study indicate that la cause activation of the rat stress inducible hspa1b gene. in addition, we observed that lipofectamine induced expression changes of the mouse hspa1b gene and other stress genes as well as many unrelated ones in the b16f <dig> cells. we postulate that these transfection agents may not be suitable for functional studies of hsp <dig> promoters.

we are also convinced that the phenomenon of widespread gene expression changes caused by transient transfection should be further studied as it may possibly affect the results of in vitro gene function studies done with microarrays.
