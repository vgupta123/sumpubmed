BACKGROUND
animal mitochondrial  genomes are typically a circular dna molecule, 13–20 kb in size, consisting of a control region  and  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes , and  <dig> transfer rna genes  . the organization, gene content and gene arrangement of animal mt genomes are usually very conserved  <cit> . for insects, the ancestral mt genome organization is retained in most species known, although minor changes in gene arrangement were observed in several groups of insects .

the order psocoptera  contains more than  <dig>  described species in three suborders: troctomorpha, trogiomorpha, and psocomorpha  <cit> . complete or near complete mt genomes have been reported for three barklice  and two booklice  . the mt genomes of the three barklice, lepidopsocidae sp. rs- <dig> , psococerastis albimaculata and longivalvus hyalospilus , retained largely the ancestral mt genome organization of insects with rearrangement of several genes in each species  <cit> . the mt genomes of the two booklice, liposcelis decolor and l. bostrychophila , however, are highly rearranged; only one ancestral gene arrangement, atp8-atp <dig>  is retained. these two booklice differ even from each other in the organization of their mt genomes. l. decolor, like most other insects, has the typical single-chromosome mt genome of animals  <cit> . l. bostrychophila, however, has a multipartite mt genome with two chromosomes  <cit> .

the genus liposcelis has more than  <dig> species with a worldwide distribution ; many of them are important pests to stored grain products  <cit> . liposcelis species are divided into four groups phylogenetically: a, b, c and d  <cit> . l. decolor is in the group b whereas l. bostrychophila is in the group d  <cit> . substantial variation in morphology and physiology among liposcelis groups has been reported previously  <cit> . to understand how multipartite mt genomes evolved in the genus liposcelis, we further sequenced the mt genomes of l. entomophila  and l. paeta . we found that these two booklice also have multipartite mt genomes, like l. bostrychophila. further, l. entomophila and l. paeta differ substantially from each other and from l. bostrychophila in gene content and gene arrangement in their mt genomes. our results indicate an unusually fast evolution in mt genome organization in the booklice of the genus liposcelis.

ethics statement
no specific permits were required for the insects collected in this study. the sampling locations were not privately owned or protected in any way and the collection did not involve endangered or protected species.

sample collection, dna extraction and mt genome amplification
the booklice were collected at grain storage facilities. l. entomophila were collected in beibei, chongqing and l. paeta in wuzhou, guangxi, china. they were identified to species by morphology  <cit> , and partial sequences of rrnl and cox <dig> genes  <cit> . total genomic dna was extracted from ~ <dig> booklice specimens  using a tissue/cell gdna mini kit  and stored at -20°c.

partial sequences of cox <dig>  cob, rrns, and rrnl genes of l. entomophila were amplified initially by pcr with conserved insect primers  <cit> . two pairs of primers, e1 - e <dig> and e3 - e <dig>  were designed from cox <dig> and cob genes . two overlapping fragments were amplified by long pcr with e1 - e <dig> and e3 - e <dig>  sequenced and assembled into a contig  with seqman . the non-coding sequence, which contains the sites for genome replication and the initiation of gene transcription, is always shared by all of mini-chromosomes of a fragment mt genome  <cit> . thus, a primer  has been designed from a non-coding region  in l. entomophila chromosome i. another primer  was designed from rrnl gene. with e5 - e <dig>  a  <dig>  bp long fragment was amplified and sequenced. a pair of outbound primers  was designed from this fragment, and a complementary sequence of e5 - e <dig> was amplified. these two fragments were assembled into a contig. for l. paeta, fragments of nad <dig>  rrns and rrnl genes were amplified initially; four pairs of primers  were designed from these three gene fragments. then, four fragments were amplified with these four pairs of primers, and were assembled into two contigs . to verify l. paeta chromosome ii and avoid the mistake might be caused by primers  at pseudogene prrnl- <dig>  a  <dig>  bp fragment was amplified additionally with primers p9-p <dig> .

each long pcr reaction is 25 μl in volume, containing  <dig>  μl each of forward primer  and reverse primer ,  <dig>  μl of dntps mix ,  <dig>  μl of template dna,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl of 10 × la pcr reaction buffer ii,  <dig>  μl ddh2o and  <dig>  μl la taq dna polymerase . all reactions were carried out using c1000tm thermal cyclers  with the follow conditions: 2 min denaturation at 94°c, 37 cycles of 94°c for 20 s, 58°c for 50 s, 68°c for 5–10 min , followed by a final extension at 68°c for 15 min. gel-purified amplification products < 5 kb in size were ligated into pgem-t easy vectors , and introduced into escherichia coli . followed by ampicillin selection, plasmid dnas from positive clones were sequenced with m <dig> primers. longer pcr products  were directly sequenced with both forward and reverse pcr primers and internal primers by primer walking. all products were sequenced by life technologies in guangzhou, china.

sequence annotation and analysis
the protein-coding genes  were identified by the orf finder  and rrna genes by blast searches, then confirmed by alignment with homologous genes from those of other booklouse and louse species . the transfer rna genes were identified by cloverleaf secondary structure using arwen  <cit>  with default parameters and trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit>  with the parameters: search mode = “eufindtrna-cove”, genetic code = “invertebrate mito” and cove score cutoff =  <dig> . we used mfold server  <cit>  in rna folding form with default parameters to construct the typical stem-loop secondary structure of putative control region. the base composition was analyzed with bioedit . sequences of mt genomes of other lice and booklice were retrieved from genbank and mitozoa  <cit>  .

phylogenetic analyses
we conducted phylogenetic analyses of the mt genome sequences of seven species of psocoptera and thirteen species of phthiraptera. the mt genome sequence of drosophila melanogaster was used as an outgroup. sequences of all protein-coding genes and rrna genes except atp <dig> and nad4l were used in phylogenetic analyses. atp <dig>  nad4l and trna genes were excluded because they are too short to align among the psocodean species. two alignments were used for phylogenetic analyses: 1) a concatenated nucleotide sequence alignment of protein-coding genes and two rrna genes ; 2) a concatenated amino acid sequence alignment of eleven protein-coding genes . nucleotide sequences of all protein-coding genes were aligned at the amino acid level using the default settings in clustalw as implemented in mega  <dig>  <cit> ; the alignments were then back-translated into the corresponding nucleotide sequences. amino acid sequences of pcgs were aligned in clustalw; all of the alignments were then imported into the gblocks server  to remove poorly aligned sites  <cit> . gblocks server was applied with the ‘codons’, ‘dna’ and ‘protein’ mode respectively for pcg nucleotide sequences, rrna sequences and pcg amino acid sequences, and with all options for a stringent selection were chosen. substitution saturations of the nucleotide sequences were examined using dambe  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . whole pcg nucleotide sequences were selected to enter the next step if iss  was significantly lower than iss.c  . all of the protein-coding genes, except nad <dig> and nad <dig>  passed this test; the third codon positions of nad <dig> and nad <dig> were thus excluded from our phylogenetic analyses. the best fit models for the alignment of nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence were determined using the akaike information criterion in jmodeltest  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and prottest  <dig>   <cit> , then the gtr + i + g model and mtart + i + g + f model were chosen. phylogenetic trees were constructed from the dataset using maximum likelihood  method. ml analyses were performed using phyml <dig>    <cit>  with substitution model ‘gtr’ or ‘mtart’, type of tree improvement “spr & nni”, and the shape parameter and the propotion of invariable sites was estimated by jmodeltest  <dig> . <dig> and prottest  <dig> .

RESULTS
mitochondrial genomes of l. entomophilaand l. paeta
the mt genome of l. entomophila consists of two circular chromosomes, i  and ii . chromosome i,  <dig>  bp long, was assembled from two overlapping pcr amplicons,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp , respectively . these two amplicons overlap by 64 bp in cox <dig> and 284 bp in cob. the other two amplicons, e5 - e <dig>  and e7 - e <dig> , were assembled to form chromosome ii,  <dig>  bp long; these two amplicons overlap by 347 bp in rrnl and 470 bp in ncrii- <dig> . totally,  <dig> of the  <dig> mt genes typical of bilateral animals and  <dig> pseudogenes were found in the two mt chromosomes of l. entomophila. chromosome i contains  <dig> protein-coding genes  and three pseudogenes. chromosome ii contains two rrna genes ,  <dig> trna genes  and a pcg  . additionally,  <dig> pseudogenes were also found on this chromosome .figure  <dig>

the mt genome of l. paeta also had two chromosomes: i  and ii . these two chromosomes were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long. chromosome i was assembled from two overlapping fragments, p1 - p <dig>  and p3 - p <dig> . chromosome ii was assembled from p5 - p <dig>  and p7 - p <dig> . p1 - p <dig> and p3 - p <dig> overlap by 218 bp in nad <dig> and 731 bp in rrnl, and the other two fragments overlap by 117 bp in rrns and 233 bp in prrnl- <dig> . to verify these contigs, a  <dig>  bp fragment  was amplified additionally with primers p9 - p <dig> . we found  <dig> of the  <dig> mt genes typical of bilateral animals and  <dig> pseudogenes in l. paeta. chromosome i contains  <dig> protein-coding genes , an rrna gene , three trna genes  and a pseudogene. chromosome ii contains three protein-coding genes , rrns,  <dig> trna genes  and seven pseudogenes .

the mt gene arrangements of l. entomophila and l. paeta differ from that of the hypothetical ancestor of insects, from that of the other booklice and from each other. l. entomophila shares no mt gene boundary with the hypothetical ancestor of insects, l. paeta, l. bostrychophila, and l. decolor. for l. paeta, only atp8-atp <dig> is shared with the hypothetical ancestor of insects, l. bostrychophila and l. decolor, and cox3-cox <dig> and nad4-nad <dig> are shared with l. bostrychophila, which is also from the group d of liposcelis species .figure  <dig>

pseudogenes and non-coding sequences
we identified  <dig> and  <dig> pseudo mt genes in l. entomophila and l. paeta, respectively . the total length of all of the  <dig> pseudogenes in l. entomophila is  <dig>  bp, which accounts for  <dig> % of the total length of the two chromosomes. for l. paeta, the total length of all of the  <dig> pseudogenes is  <dig>  bp, which accounts for  <dig> % of the two mt chromosomes we sequenced. each of the mt pseudogenes is a partial sequence of a protein-coding gene or an rrna gene with several nucleotides changed, and has a high similarity  to the homologous sequence in functional gene . for instance, pcox1- <dig> of l. entomophila, located on the chromosome ii, is 847 bp long and is identical to the part of cox <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp except for a single nucleotide change .table  <dig>

non-coding sequences also account for large proportions of the mt chromosomes of l. entomophila and l. paeta. the non-coding sequences are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long, in total, for l. entomophila and l. paeta, and account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the entire length of their mt chromosomes. there are  <dig> and  <dig> non-coding sequences that are longer than 100 bp in the mt chromosomes of l. entomophila and l. paeta, respectively. for both l. entomophila and l. paeta, pseudogenes and non-coding sequences are largely on one of the mt chromosomes , whereas coding sequences are on the other chromosome  . intriguingly, partial sequences are shared by three or two non-coding regions in l. entomophila and l. paeta. three non-coding regions  of l. entomophila, each two of the three share a consistent sequence, and a partial sequence is common in all of the three. in l. paeta, two non-coding regions from mt chromosome ii  contain the same 286 bp sequence with two nucleotides change .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships among species of psocodea
we analyzed the mt genome sequences with maximum likelihood  method to infer the phylogenetic relationship of l. entomophila, l. paeta, l. bostrychophila, l. decolor and with other species of psocodea . in the phylogenetic tree, the four liposcelis species were clustered together with strong support . within the genus liposcelis, l. paeta formed a clade with l. bostrychophila; these two species, which were from group d  <cit> , were most closely related to l. entomophila .figure  <dig>

discussion
variation in the pattern of multipartite mt genome evolution among the three liposcelisspecies
while l. decolor has the typical one-chromosome mt genome, like most other insects and animals. l. entomophila, l. paeta and l. bostrychophila have multipartite mt genomes. for these three liposcelis species, there are extensive variations in the pattern of multipartite mt genome evolution. firstly, the presence of numerous pseudogenes and non-coding sequences in l. entomophila and l. paeta makes their mt genomes much larger than that of l. bostrychophila  . furthermore, the three liposcelis species that have multipartite mt genomes differ from each other in the distribution of mt genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding sequences between the mt chromosomes. the two mt chromosomes of l. bostrychophila contain nearly equal amounts of genes, pseudogenes and non-coding sequences. for l. entomophila and l. paeta, however, most of the mt genes are on one chromosome, whereas pseudogenes and non-coding sequences are on the other chromosome . for numerous non-coding sequences, the two mt chromosomes of l. bostrychophila contain the same major non-coding region   <cit> . however, three non-coding regions from two chromosomes of l. entomophila share partial sequences and two non-coding regions from mt chromosome ii of l. paeta share a 286 bp sequence . for fragmented mt genome of blood-sucking lice  and the rotifers  <cit> , mini-chromosomes usually have similar major non-coding sequences. the arrangement of mt genes varies extensively among the three liposcelis species; indeed, no gene boundary is shared by the three booklice. the two group-d species, l. paeta and l. bostrychophila, share three gene boundaries, atp8-atp <dig>  cox3-cox <dig> and nad4-nad <dig> . prior to this study, intra-genus variations of mt gene arrangement have been reported in several animal genera, such as haematopinus
 <cit> , polyplax
 <cit> , brachionus
 <cit> , ciona
 <cit> , phallusia
 <cit> , corallium
 <cit> , schistosoma
 <cit> , leptotrombidium
 <cit> , and dermatophagoides
 <cit> . however, the extent of variation in these genera is much lower than that in the genus liposcelis.

pseudo mt genes and duplicated non-coding sequences in the liposcelisspecies
prior to the present study, pseudo mt genes have been described in l. bostrychophila and numerous other animals. most of the pseudo mt genes are short and derived from trnas . pseudo mt genes longer than 100 bp, derived from protein-coding genes, were also reported . mt gene rearrangements are usually explained by a tandem duplication-random loss  model  <cit> , and pseudo mt genes are considered to be redundant genes in the process of being eliminated  <cit> . the large numbers of pseudo mt genes we found in l. entomophila and l. paeta in this study and in l. bostrychophila
 <cit>  are extraordinary for insects and animals, indicating that large-scale changes, such as tandem duplication or mt chromosome duplication, occurred relatively recently in the multipartite mt genomes of these booklice. intriguingly, no pseudo mt gene has been found in l. decolor, although it also has numerous gene rearrangements like the other three liposcelis species that have multipartite mt genomes  <cit> . it infers that mt genome fragmenting is the important inducement for pseudo mt gene appearance in booklice. for fragmented mt genomes, mt pseudogenes were found in the human pubic louse  <cit> , the polyplax rat lice  <cit> , the globodera nematodes  <cit>  and the chimeric mt minichromosomes of the human body louse  <cit> . the explanation for the pseudo mt gene present in these species is that a recombinatorial mechanism is responsible for their production. this explanation may be applicable for multipartite mt genome in liposcelis, pseudo mt gene would be residues of interchromosome recombination. duplicated non-coding sequence present coincided with pseudo mt gene in booklice multipartite mt genomes. the sequences, “cox2 + ncri-1” from chromosome i and “pcox2-2 + ncrii-2” from chromosome ii in l. entomophila, have a  <dig> % similarity and four nucleotides changed . this indicats that “pcox2-2 + ncrii-2” is generated as an entire block and derived from “cox2 + ncri-1”. therefore, the causation of duplicated non-coding sequences present in booklice might be consistent with that of pseudo mt genes. the same situation has also been found in l. bostrychophila
 <cit>  and human body louse  <cit> .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships among liposcelisspecies inferred from mitochondrial genome sequences and organization
although l. decolor differ from the other three liposcelis species in mt genome organization, these four booklice are more closely related to each other than to other species in the psocodea, that also echoes previous researches . in the phylogenetic tree, l. decolor , representing the booklice with typical single chromosome mt genome, was split off from the others firstly, and the three booklice with multipartite mt genome were clustered into the same branch. this was also indicated by sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers region  <cit> . this suggested that the multipartite mt genome organization observed in booklice likely evolved recently after l. decolor split from the most recent common ancestor. however, all of the blood-sucking lice  in a branch have extreme fragmented mt genomes, that mt genome fragment began from the common ancestor of the suborder anoplura. it can be inferred that the multipartite mt genome organization in liposcelis evolved independently from fragmented mt genomes exist in the blood-sucking lice. for three booklice with multipartite mt genome, l. paeta  and l. bostrychophila  were clustered together, and formed a sister clade to l. entomophila . this result is consistent with the previous studies  <cit>  and can be concluded by mt gene arrangement analyses. l. paeta share three gene boundaries with l. bostrychophila, but share none of gene boundary with l. entomophila. however, genome size, gene distribution and a + t content show l. entomophila and l. paeta have more close relationship to each other. mt gene rearrangement is a common phenomenon in psocodea, and is occurred even more seriously in booklice. the gene boundaries shared by l. paeta and l. bostrychophila as powerful evidences to support the close relationship between them. then, the disparities of genome size, gene distribution and a + t content may indicate different evolution speeds and patterns of multipartite mt genome in liposcelis species.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the booklice, l. entomophila and l. paeta. both of these two mitochondrial genomes are multipartite like l. bostrychophila. numerous pseudogenes and non-coding regions have been found in these mt genomes, and one mt chromosome has most of protein-coding genes whereas the other chromosome has largely pseudogenes and non-coding regions. however, the mt genes are distributed approximately equally between the two chromosomes in l. bostrychophila. l. entomophila and l. paeta differ substantially from each other and from l. bostrychophila in gene content and gene arrangement in their mt chromosomes. although the four liposcelis species are different from each other in mt genome organization, they were clustered together with strong support in the phylogenetic tree. then, these results indicate unusually fast evolution in mt genome organization in the booklice of the genus liposcelis, and reveal different patterns of mt genome fragmentation among l. bostrychophila, l. entomophila and l. paeta.
