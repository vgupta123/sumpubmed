BACKGROUND
planarians, free-living flatworms with an extraordinary ability to regenerate, are regarded as an excellent model system for regenerative studies. these animals possess the ability to regenerate an entire organism from small body fragments from a population of adult stem cells   <cit> . recently, single neoblast transplantation experiments demonstrated that a subset of these cells  are truly pluripotent and can differentiate into any planarian cell type or tissue lost by amputation, injury, or normal physiological turnover  <cit> .

planarians have several distinct major organ systems . they possess a centralized nervous system , consisting of bi-lobed cephalic ganglia, a brain-like structure located at the anterior end of the animal, connected to two longitudinal ventral nerve cords  that project posteriorly along the length of the worm  <cit> . the majority of planarians’ light detection is achieved by their photoreceptors, which are rich in photosensitive pigment cells and photoreceptor neurons that are located on the anterior dorsal surface of the head  <cit> . planarians possess a blind digestive system  that consists of a pharynx, through which they ingest food and defecate, connected to three primary intestinal branches that distribute nutrients  <cit> . they excrete soluble waste and maintain osmoregularity with their protonephridial systems, tubular structures that extend to the exterior of the animals and are analogous to the vertebrate kidney  <cit> . thus, we can use planarians to study how defined organ systems are regenerated from adult stem cells.figure  <dig>

there have been many great advances in the past decade in identifying and optimizing tools to study the molecular basis of planarian regeneration. gene expression can be inhibited using rna interference , which allows the study of gene function  <cit> . genomic sequencing of schmidtea mediterranea and the availability of multiple transcriptomes combined with custom microarrays or mrna sequencing have facilitated identification of genes involved in the regeneration of planarian organ systems . whole-mount in situ hybridization protocols have been developed and optimized for the visualization of gene expression in planarians  <cit> ; this information can be coupled with functional analyses to determine the role specific genes play in tissue regeneration. further, fluorescent lectins have been utilized to label several cell types in planarians, including secretory cells and the reproductive organs of hermaphroditic strains  <cit> . however, there is a dearth of cell-type and tissue-specific antibodies to examine the effects of experimental manipulation in planarians. available antibodies known to label tissues in s. mediterranea include a handful of antibodies created against well-conserved antigens in other species, such as anti-phospho-tyrosine   <cit> , anti-tubulin, which recognizes ciliated epithelium and neurons  <cit> , and anti-acetylated tubulin can be used to visualize ciliated structures, including protonephridia  <cit> . cebrià et al.  <cit>  identified five antibodies  that cross-react with neurons in the cns of s. mediterranea  <cit> . a small selection of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been created against s. mediterranea antigens such as anti-smedwi, which labels planarian stem cells and their progeny  <cit> . tmus- <dig>  originally generated against dugesia tigrina  <cit> , has since been used to label the musculature in s. mediterranea  <cit> , and monoclonal antibodies that recognize plasma membrane proteins on subsets of cells within x-ray sensitive and insensitive populations have also been created  <cit> .

additional antibodies will be useful to further characterize the cellular diversity found within planarian tissues, to track differentiation of planarian cell types, and to expand our understanding of the distribution and dynamics of tissue repair and replacement following wounding events. discovery of cell surface markers would allow for sorting of specific cell populations, enabling the analysis of gene expression profiles for defined cell populations like the transcriptional profiles available for the heterogeneous irradiation sensitive populations, x <dig>  and x <dig>   <cit> . finally, it would be advantageous to have additional markers available for analyzing regeneration phenotypes following rnai experiments.

here, we report on the generation of monoclonal antibodies that recognize tissues in s. mediterranea. these antibodies were created by inoculating mice with formaldehyde-fixed cells derived from 3-day head blastemas. we tested the utility of these reagents for immunocytochemistry using multiple fixation protocols on intact and regenerating planarians and determined the optimal conditions for each antibody in asexual s. mediterranea. we describe this new set of markers and their staining patterns in muscle, neural structures, ciliated structures , intestinal cells, and stem cell progeny. these antibodies are currently available to the community through the developmental studies hybridoma bank .

RESULTS
to generate monoclonal antibodies  that label planarian neoblast progeny and differentiated cell populations, we isolated cells from regeneration blastemas. planarians were amputated pre-pharyngeally, and trunk fragments were allowed to initiate regeneration of a new head. at 3 days post-amputation , regeneration blastemas were isolated by transverse cutting, dissociated into single cells, fixed with formaldehyde, and used to inoculate mice to create hybridoma lines . we tested supernatants from  <dig> hybridoma lines by immunostaining intact and regenerating planarians;  <dig> supernatants were positive for staining in  <dig> dpa regeneration blastemas, discrete cell populations, or tissues in formaldehyde-fixed planarians. we selected  <dig> hybridomas for expansion and re-testing. the majority  of these  <dig> hybridomas were positive for immunostaining in  <dig> dpa blastemas. based on the staining patterns, signal and background intensities,  <dig> lines were chosen for additional expansion and re-screened in planarians, using eight different fixation protocols . when re-tested,  <dig> of  <dig> were positive, and  <dig> were selected for hybridoma sub-cloning. seven monoclonal hybridoma cell-lines and one polyclonal antibody were successfully generated . below, we describe the labeling patterns of these antibodies.table  <dig>

smed-6g <dig> and -2g <dig> label planarian musculature
planarians have a subepidermal muscle wall that consists of four layers of muscle fibers: circular, longitudinal, diagonal, and a final layer of longitudinal fibers located between two nerve plexuses  <cit> . additionally, there are abundant fibers traversing the parenchyma along the dorsoventral axis, muscle fibers surrounding the intestine, pharynx, and the mouth, and some transverse muscle fibers associated with the intestine  <cit> . smed-6g <dig>  and polyclonal antibody smed-2g <dig>  labeled an extensive network of muscle fibers in the planarian body . in the muscle wall, we observed strong 6g <dig> and 2g <dig> labeling in circular and diagonal muscle fibers , and strong 2g <dig> labeling in longitudinal fibers . interestingly, 6g <dig> weakly labeled some longitudinal fibers , whereas a subset of circular fibers marked by 6g <dig> were weakly labeled with 2g <dig> . in addition, 6g <dig> labeled the layer of enteric muscles that surrounds the intestine  and the transverse fibers near the intestine . by contrast, 2g <dig> staining was not detected in this muscle population, but was detected in the dorsoventral fibers of the parenchyma . this difference was striking in the mouth region where 6g <dig> marked the pharyngeal muscles; 2g <dig> labeled circular fibers surrounding the periphery of the mouth but did not label the pharynx .figure  <dig>

the planarian musculature is composed of myocytes that lack striations but match neither the smooth nor striated muscle types. planarian muscle fibers differ in their composition of myosin heavy chain proteins   <cit> . the 6g <dig> and 2g <dig> staining patterns were similar to those of mhc-a and -b containing muscle fibers, respectively  <cit> . it has been shown that mhc-a containing muscle fibers are found in the pharynx, enteric muscles, and the circular and diagonal muscle wall fibers in dugesia japonica, similar to what we observed in s. mediterranea labeled with 6g <dig> . by contrast, mhc-b containing muscle fibers are located in body-wall muscles and dorsoventral fibers, but not in enteric muscle fibers  <cit> , which correlates with 2g <dig> labeling. similar to mhc-a and -b proteins, our data suggest 6g <dig> and 2g <dig> recognize differentially expressed proteins in muscle.

smed-1h <dig> marks axonal projections in the nervous system
smed-1h <dig>  labeled the axonal projections in subsets of cells in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. in the cns, 1h <dig> labeled the ventral nerve cords  , which are known to extend anteriorly through the head region, beneath the cephalic ganglia  <cit> . 1h6+ projections were observed in the anterior tip of the vncs . 1h <dig> also labeled the transverse axon branches between the vncs and the lateral axon branches extending from the vncs . we observed 1h <dig> labeling in the lateral branches of the cephalic ganglia ; these axon projections are known to extend to the sides of the head where they penetrate the epidermis in sensory neuron-rich areas  <cit> . to confirm 1h <dig> labeling in these branches, we processed planarians for 1h <dig> immunolabeling and in situ hybridization to g protein α-subunit , which marks distal lateral branch neurons  <cit> . we found that 1h <dig> strongly co-labeled with gpas , suggesting that 1h <dig> binds an antigen found in the axonal projections of sensory neurons.figure  <dig>

our initial observations were that 1h <dig> did not label the neuropil region of the cephalic ganglia; thus, we co-stained 1h6-labeled planarians with the pan-neural antibody anti-synapsin  <cit> . we found that while 1h <dig> labeling corresponded with synapsin expression along many neural projections throughout the nervous system  1h <dig> labeling was absent in the synapsin-dense neuropil of the cephalic ganglia .

axons labeled with 1h <dig> partially overlapped with neural projections that were positive for anti-collapsin response mediator protein  <dig>  throughout the body . crmp <dig> is a cytosolic phosphoprotein found across the metazoans with high expression during neural development and retained expression in mature neurons, and is implicated in neurite outgrowth, synaptic assembly, calcium channel regulation, and neurotransmitter release  <cit> . we found that a commercially available antibody designed against human crmp <dig> marked neurons throughout the planarian cns and peripheral nervous system  and recently reported that crmp2+ neurons co-label with the neural markers β-tubulin and choline acetyltransferase   <cit> . additionally, we observed that some 1h6+ cells were positive for prohormone convertase  <dig> ; pc <dig>  which encodes a protease that is essential for processing neuropeptide precursor proteins to their mature forms, is found in a subset of cells throughout the planarian nervous system  <cit> .

planarians are enveloped with a monolayer of ciliated epithelium, beneath which lies a thin  nerve net, referred to as the subepidermal nerve plexus  <cit> . the fibers in this plexus extend through the basement membrane of the epidermal layer, forming intra-epithelial fibers  <cit> . proximal to the subepidermal plexus lies the muscle wall, followed by a submuscular nerve net   <cit> . these plexuses are part of the peripheral nervous system in planarians  <cit> . to determine if these plexuses contained 1h6+ projections, we co-stained 1h6-labeled planarians with 6g <dig> and dapi to label the contractile muscle layer and visualize the epithelial nuclei, respectively. 1h6+ fibers were seen in the submuscular plexus  and in projections extending between epithelial cells . to resolve labeling in the subepidermal plexus, we observed 1h6-labeled planarians from the ventral surface through the submuscular plexus at  <dig>  μm intervals. we noted projections extending between and past the epithelial nuclei  and sparse mesh-like fibers as the epithelial nuclei disappeared from the field-of-view  indicating labeling of the subepidermal plexus. 1h6+ fibers projected through the muscle layers, etching a pattern in the negative impressions of the muscle fibers: circular, longitudinal, diagonal, and finally the last layer of longitudinal fibers of the muscle wall . the thicker, more clearly defined meshwork of the submuscular plexus was detected below the final muscle layer . it will be interesting to identify the epitope recognized by 1h <dig> to resolve if it labels a subpopulation of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems or a specific cellular compartment found in most neurons.

smed-2c <dig> is expressed in discrete cells in the regeneration blastema and a subset of neurons and intestinal cells
we observed multiple distinct cell morphologies  throughout the planarian body that labeled with smed-2c <dig>  . the first cell type  had cytoplasmic 2c <dig> labeling and small cell bodies approximately  <dig>  μm in diameter . we observed that 2c4-s cells were weakly labeled with 2c <dig> near the epidermis throughout the intact worm  but strongly labeled within the regeneration blastema . to explore whether these cells were secretory, we performed co-labeling experiments with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin , which labels a subset of secretory cells  <cit>  and found that 2c4-s cells were not wga+ . in order to determine when the protein recognized by 2c <dig> is expressed during regeneration, we amputated animals anterior and posterior to the pharynx to analyze the presence of 2c4-s cells during 7 days post-amputation. 2c4+ cells were detected in both the anterior and posterior blastemas at all the timepoints we examined .figure  <dig>

the second cell type labeled by 2c <dig> consisted of ventrally located oblong cells  of approximately  <dig>  μm in diameter  . these cells have bipolar projections and resemble the large multipolar neurons observed in flatworms using silver nitrate staining and lucifer yellow dye  <cit> . the projections from these cells extend both laterally and longitudinally . we found that 2c4-n cells were located on the ventral side of the planarian, excluding the head region . similar to 2c4-s cells, these cells did not co-label with wga  based on morphology and their large size, we hypothesize that 2c4-n cells are likely neurosecretory cells. future experiments should test if 2c <dig> co-labels cells expressing neuropeptide genes in planarians  <cit> .

the third cell type observed with 2c <dig> labeling was a large  <dig>  μm in diameter  round cell with large cytoplasm that appeared to be located in or near the intestine . to determine the relative location of these cells, we co-labeled 2c4-stained planarians with 6g <dig> to visualize the enteric muscles, which serve as a boundary between the intestinal epithelium and the mesenchyme . we found that 2c4-i cells were located within the anterior and posterior branches of the intestine . we further explored the identity of these cells by performing co-labeling experiments with the lectin lens culinaris agglutinin , which labels goblet cells  <cit> . we found that a subset of 2c4-i cells were indeed lca+ goblet cells . strikingly, we found that 2c4-i+ cells in the secondary and tertiary intestinal branches had fainter lca expression , whereas the goblet cells with strongest lca expression anterior to the pharynx were weakly positive for 2c <dig> . because 2c <dig> labels large neuronal cells surrounding the pharynx and cells within the intestine, the protein that 2c <dig> recognizes may be highly expressed in cells involved in secretion; however, this question will only be definitively answered upon identification of the 2c <dig> epitope.

we found that 2c <dig> labeling was highly dependent on the fixation protocol used . whereas 2c4-i and -n cells could be seen with a multitude of fixation protocols, labeling of 2c4-s cells within the blastema was absent or very difficult to detect in fixations using hcl for the initial kill step or with inclusion of proteinase k treatment.

smed-5b <dig> marks ciliated cells
staining planarians with smed-5b <dig>  revealed a pattern strikingly similar to those observed with anti-acetylated tubulin and in situ hybridizations against protonephridial markers   <cit> . the planarian protonephridial system, analogous to the metanephridial systems found in vertebrates  <cit> , maintains osmoregularity and excretes waste. protonephridia in planaria consist of fenestrated, ciliated flame cells, which connect to tubules that are ciliated proximal to the flame cells and are non-ciliated distal to the flame cells  <cit> . protonephridia are located along the majority of the length of the planarian body. anti-acetylated tubulin labels the flame cells and ciliated tubules of protonephridia as well as all other ciliated structures in planarians  <cit> . therefore, we tested if 5b <dig> would co-label with anti-acetylated tubulin. we found that 5b <dig> labeled the tubules of the protonephridia, exterior to the cilia, in a pattern consistent with labeling of the ciliated tubule cells’ cytoplasm or membrane . labeling was also observed surrounding acetylated tubulin labeling at the flame bulb, which is also highly ciliated . this observation led us to explore whether 5b <dig> was associated with other ciliated cell types. planarians have a high abundance of ciliated cells in the epithelium on their ventral surface and in a discrete stripe running along the dorsal anteroposterior axis; these structures are positive for acetylated tubulin  <cit> . we detected 5b <dig> labeling within the dorsal ciliated stripe and the ventral ciliated epithelial cell surface .figure  <dig>

smed-1d <dig> labels the nucleus of a subset of progenitors and cells in close proximity to the central nervous system
smed-1d <dig>  marked cells throughout the mesenchyme and surrounding the cephalic ganglia  and vncs . counterstaining with dapi revealed that 1d <dig> labeled cell nuclei . the labeling pattern in the mesenchyme was reminiscent of staining for neoblasts  <cit>  and their early progeny  <cit> . during our initial screenings, we noted that 1d <dig> strongly labeled the regeneration blastema; thus, we examined the pattern of 1d <dig> expression during regeneration. we found that 1d <dig> labeled the blastema at  <dig> dpa through one week of regeneration in a pattern reminiscent of the nascent cephalic ganglia , although we do not think the staining is exclusively in neurons. co-labeling with additional markers will be necessary to confirm which cell types label with 1d <dig> during regeneration.figure  <dig>

the neoblast and progenitor-like labeling pattern and the presence of 1d9+ cells in the regeneration blastema led us to explore the possibility that 1d <dig> labels either neoblasts or progenitors. to test this, we performed co-labeling experiments with 1d <dig> and anti-smedwi, which labels both neoblasts and their progeny  <cit> . we first examined the region near the cephalic ganglia in the intact worm and detected many co-labeled cells . next, we inspected the animals for co-labeling in the mesenchyme, immediately posterior to the pharynx, which is rich in neoblasts. intriguingly, we observed that fewer smedwi+ cells co-labeled with 1d <dig> in this region and also noticed that the levels of 1d <dig> expression were lower when compared with double-labeled cells proximal to the cephalic ganglia . further experimentation and quantitative analysis will be required to resolve the differential expression of 1d <dig> throughout the animal. the expression of genes known to play roles in neural differentiation has been observed in both differentiated cells and their progenitors  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that 1d <dig> recognizes a protein present in progenitors and cells associated with the nervous system.

smed-6c <dig> is expressed in cells within the planarian intestine and the regeneration blastema
smed-6c <dig>  labeled cells in a punctate pattern throughout the planarian body that resembled the shape of the intestinal branches . therefore, we performed co-labeling experiments with 6g <dig> to visualize the enteric musculature and determine if 6c <dig> marks intestinal cells. these experiments showed that 6c8+ cells were generally located on the luminal side of the enteric muscle wall in both the anterior and posterior of the animal . however, some 6c8+ cells were detected outside, but still associated with the enteric muscular boundary . we counterstained samples with dapi and found that 6c <dig> labeling was located in the nucleus of cells . because 2c <dig> also labeled an intestinal cell population, we examined if the 2c <dig> and 6c <dig> epitopes were expressed in the same cells or in different cell populations. when we performed co-labeling experiments, we noted that 2c <dig> and 6c <dig> marked distinct intestinal cell populations . furthermore, 6c <dig> was not expressed in lca+ goblet cells .figure  <dig>

intestinal cells are derived from neoblasts that divide outside of the intestine  <cit> . our experiments showed 6c <dig> labels a cell population adjacent and within the intestinal musculature boundary. thus, we hypothesized that 6c <dig> labels cells that are specified to become intestinal cells in the mesenchyme and are in the process of incorporating into the intestinal epithelium. to evaluate this possibility further, we examined 6c <dig> expression during regeneration. we amputated planarians anterior and posterior to the pharynx and observed 6c <dig> labeling between  <dig> and 7 days of regeneration . 6c8-labeled cells were difficult to detect or completely absent in  <dig> dpa regenerates in the blastema and throughout the worm . in contrast, we readily detected strong expression of 6c <dig> near the anterior and posterior regeneration blastemas from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa ; we also noted cells with 6c <dig> expression in a cytoplasmic punctate pattern . interestingly, beginning at  <dig> dpa we observed 6c <dig> labeling outside of the blastema in a pattern resembling the intestinal branches . extensive remodeling of the intestine is required to restore proper intestinal morphology following amputation  <cit> . the presence of 6c8+ cells within the intestinal musculature boundary and their location during regeneration suggests to us that these cells represent differentiating intestinal cells. this possibility should be tested further with brdu pulse/chase experiments to determine if 6c8+ cells co-label with brdu within the enteric muscle boundary  <cit> .

smed-5e <dig> is strongly expressed in cells in the regeneration blastema
smed-5e <dig>  was not readily detected in intact planarians. we observed a punctate expression pattern in some animals, but this was inconsistent . therefore, it was difficult to discern 5e <dig> labeling in defined cell types or tissues . by contrast, when we amputated planarians, fixed, and immunolabeled them at  <dig> dpa, we observed strong 5e <dig> labeling in anterior and posterior regeneration blastemas . to determine the expression of this antibody during the course of regeneration we fixed and stained regenerating trunk fragments at 2– <dig> dpa and observed 5e <dig> labeling in the blastema at all the time points tested . it was interesting to note that expression was seen in a population of cells proximal to the blastema in regenerating animals , suggesting that 5e <dig> labels a progenitor population. thus, 5e <dig> can serve as a marker of the blastema following injury or amputation. it will be interesting to determine if 5e <dig> can mark the formation of ectopic structures such as generation of supernumerary heads that follow rnai knockdown of β-catenin- <dig> in intact animals  <cit> . in addition, the fixation protocol for this antibody may require further optimization to stain or preserve the epitope in non-injured animals, and additional co-labeling experiments will be needed to investigate the identity of the 5e12+ blastema cells.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we have produced new monoclonal antibodies that can be used to study tissue regeneration, structure, and function in planarians. with the exception of polyclonal smed-2g <dig>  these antibodies were deposited to the developmental studies hybridoma bank. we have demonstrated that these antibodies label diverse tissues in planarians and can be useful for examining phenotypes following rnai. in addition, we determined that the labeling efficiency of antibodies used for whole-mount staining of planarians greatly depends on the fixation protocols. many of the mabs that we generated did not display any discernable staining pattern when treated with subsets of the reagents used in the eight formaldehyde fixation protocols we tested . the observation that most of the antibodies do not work well with carnoy’s fixative is likely due to the fact that these antibodies were generated against cells fixed with formaldehyde. further optimization of these protocols could prove helpful for future experiments that warrant co-labeling with currently incompatible antibodies.

future studies will examine the epitopes detected by these mabs, which could potentially increase their usefulness as markers for phenotypic analysis or other applications. it will be interesting to determine if these antibodies label other species of planarians and the hermaphroditic strain of s. mediterranea. as an initial test, we performed labeling experiments with three of these antibodies  in hermaphrodites. as expected, we found that these mabs produced the same staining patterns observed in the asexual strain, but with limited penetrance throughout the body and increased background signal . additional modifications to the fixation protocols will be necessary to use the mabs with larger animals as in previous studies  <cit> . in conclusion, these antibodies should help to expand the molecular toolkit available for studies using planarians.
