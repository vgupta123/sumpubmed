BACKGROUND
human t-cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  was identified in  <dig> as the first oncogenic human retrovirus. infection is associated with adult t-cell leukemia  as well as other pathological disorders such as tropical spastic paraparesis/htlv- <dig> associated myelopathy   <cit> . it is estimated that  <dig> million people worldwide are infected with htlv-i. htlv-i is endemic in japan, the caribbean, south america and central africa. the majority of carriers will remain asymptomatic throughout their entire lives, and data from japan has estimated that approximately  <dig> % of infected males and  <dig> % of infected females will ultimately develop atl during their lifespan  <cit> . htlv-i is transmitted vertically from mother to child prior to birth or through contaminated blood products. intriguingly, individuals infected with htlv- <dig> later in life rarely present with atl, suggesting that infection during infancy is an important factor for the development of atl.

htlv-i is a relatively small virus with a genome only  <dig> kb in size that encodes for the classic retroviral structural proteins gag, pol, and env. downstream of the env gene lies a unique region, named px, which encodes for a number of non-structural proteins involved in virus gene expression and cell transformation, including tax, rex, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and hbz. replication of htlv-i is dependent on the expression of the viral transactivating protein, tax, which recruits creb, cbp/p <dig> and pcaf, to activate viral gene transcription from the viral ltr  <cit> . as tax has been implicated in the activation of a number of cell survival pathways, it is believed to be primarily responsible for facilitating cell transformation and the onset of leukemia. tax, however, is highly immunogenic and cells expressing high amounts of tax are readily detected and cleared by the human immune system. as a result, cells that express low amounts of tax are preferentially selected in vivo; in fact, atl cells from leukemic patients do not express detectable viral proteins. this selective mechanism is apparent as patients who develop atl exhibit a clonal pattern of provirus integration and t-cell receptor rearrangement, indicating that atl arises from a single infected progenitor cell.

other htlv-i non-structural proteins appear to regulate various steps of virus gene expression, often through unique mechanisms. rex is an rna binding protein that binds to an rna responsive element located at the 3' terminus of all viral mrna molecules to facilitate rna export to the cytoplasm  <cit> . in contrast to tax and rex which positively regulate virus gene expression, two other viral proteins have been shown to negatively regulate gene expression. hbz, the htlv basic leucine zipper protein, is an anti-sense-encoded protein that interferes with tax-mediated viral gene expression  <cit> . another intriguing viral protein, p <dig>  is a post-transcriptional repressor of gene expression  <cit> . specifically, p <dig> expression inhibits the export of the tax/rex mrna message from the nucleus  <cit> . unlike rex, p <dig> does not shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is predominantly localized to the nucleus/nucleolus, consistent with a nuclear rna retention mechanism and function  <cit> . p <dig> interacts with rex, and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of viral rna, suggesting that p <dig> may function by binding rex in complex with viral rna, thereby inhibiting rex-dependent rna export  <cit> . it is not known, however, whether this interaction is required for the ability of p <dig> to inhibit tax mrna export from the nucleus.

recently, it has been shown that p <dig> expression also influences the cell cycle and tlr signalling  <cit> . a separate gene profile experiment suggested that p <dig> was able to specifically down-regulate a variety of cellular genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, and transcription  <cit> . whether these effects are required for htlv-i infectivity or cell transformation remains to be seen, although studies have shown that p <dig> expression is required for efficient virus replication and persistence in vivo  <cit> .

while some information is known regarding the effects of p <dig> on gene transcription, the effects of p <dig> on cellular mrna nuclear export have not been investigated. using differential gene microarray analysis on total and cytoplasmic rna extracts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing p <dig> in comparison with mock-transduced cells, we assessed the relative abundance of cellular transcripts regulated at both the transcriptional and post transcriptional level. we found that p <dig> alters the expression and nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of a number of cellular transcripts involved in rna processing, cell signalling, metabolism, and cell division. these results will help pave the way for future studies aimed at understanding the role of these cellular rna in htlv-i pathogenesis.

RESULTS
p <dig> transcriptionally regulates the expression level of various cellular mrnas
to analyze the transcriptional effects of p <dig> on global gene expression, we isolated rna from total rna pools following p <dig> expression in pbmcs using a lentiviral system. cells were co-transfected with a packaging vector pdnl <dig>  vsv-g to pseudotype lentiviral particles, and either empty vector phr'cmv, or phr'cmv:myc-p <dig>  to ensure equivalent virus production from cells transfected with either phr'cmv or phr'cmv:myc-p <dig>  we assessed the amount of lentiviral particles released into the supernatant by analyzing supernatants for hiv p <dig> gag, which is a structural protein packaged as part of the lentiviral particle. cell supernatants following transfection were harvested, lysed in sds sample buffer and separated by sds-page. western blotting with anti-p <dig> showed an equivalent amount of p <dig> in the supernatants of cells transfected with either the control plasmid phr'cmv or phr'cmv:myc-p <dig> . we also assessed the expression of p <dig> by staining lentivirus-infected cells with anti-myc to detect p <dig> by immunofluorescence. as expected, nucleolar p <dig> was observed, indicating that p <dig> was expressed following infection of co-cultured cells . to determine the percentage of cells infected using our lentiviral packaging and infection system, we co-transfected cells with phr'cmv:gfp, which expresses gfp. following lentiviral infection, greater than 85% of cells expressed gfp, indicating that our lentiviral packaging system is highly effective .

to examine rna transcript levels in pbmcs in the presence and absence of p <dig>  lentivirus-producing  <dig> t cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells for  <dig> hours, total rna was isolated and rna samples were subjected to microarray analysis. following microarray analysis, data sets were analyzed using the following steps: transcripts significantly present in the total rna fraction from cells transduced with phr'cmv lacking p <dig> were first selected. this data set was then sorted based on a decrease in transcript abundance following expression of p <dig>  sixty-five probes exhibited a decrease of greater than  <dig>  fold and were deemed to be down-regulated in the presence of p <dig> , and an additional  <dig> were down-regulated more than  <dig>  fold . these genes were found to belong to several categories, such as cell signalling, transcription/translation, cell cycle, and metabolism.

among the genes down-regulated by p <dig> was the gene encoding anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig>  which is noteworthy since htlv-1-infected cells are highly resistant to apoptosis. bcl- <dig> levels, however, are not known to be elevated in htlv-infected cells, as other anti-apoptotic proteins appear to be involved in protecting cells from apoptosis  <cit> . another apoptosis-related gene that was down-regulated, programmed cell death- <dig>   <cit> , inhibits protein synthesis by suppression of translation initiation by targeting eif-4a. in addition, loss of pdcd <dig> expression in human lung cancer cells has been shown to correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis <cit> . we also found that p <dig> down-regulates expression of presenilin  <dig>  a critical component of the gamma-secretase complex, which has been documented to be involved in notch signalling  <cit> . decreased expression of presenilin  <dig> is associated with resistance of acute t-cell lymphoblastic leukemia  to gamma-secretase inhibitors . we have previously reported that p <dig> nucleolar retention is in part due to its association with the 60s ribosomal large subunit component l23a. the present study also reveals that expression of several ribosomal proteins is reduced upon p <dig> expression, including mitochondrial ribosomal protein l <dig>  similar to ribosomal protein l <dig>  and ribosomal protein l <dig>  rab guanine nucleotide exchange factor  and the binding partner of phosphatidyl inositol 4-kinase  were both down-regulated by p <dig>  although there is no information known on htlv-i and pi4k, htlv infected cells have constitutive activation of pi3k  <cit> . we also observed a decrease in the expression of a number of zinc finger proteins, which are also commonly down-regulated in atl samples  <cit> .

we next assessed whether p <dig> expression resulted in the transcriptional up-regulation of any cellular transcripts. data sets from the above samples were instead selected based on the presence of a particular transcript in the total rna of p30-expressing cells. this data was then sorted based on an increase in transcript abundance following p <dig> expression as compared to samples transduced with the phr'cmv lentivirus alone. those probes exhibiting greater than a  <dig>  fold change in abundance in the presence of p <dig> were deemed to be up-regulated. interestingly, only  <dig> genes were up-regulated, with the largest group of genes being those involved in transcription/translation and rna processing . one of these genes, foxc <dig>  has been implicated in angiogenesis and cell migration  <cit> . while very few genes were seen to be up-regulated more than  <dig>  fold, close to  <dig> genes were up-regulated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold . interestingly, several of these genes identified are also known to be up-regulated in acute atl, including a  <dig> kda heat-shock protein, rna polymerase ii , regulator of g-protein signalling,  <cit> , and general transcription factor iih  <cit> . of note, rag- <dig> is up-regulated in our p <dig> extracts, but is conversely seen down-regulated in tax microarray analysis  <cit> , while bcl- <dig>  up-regulated in our screen , is also up-regulated by tax  <cit> .

p <dig> post-transcriptionally regulates the levels of certain cellular mrna transcripts
it has been demonstrated that p <dig> specifically inhibits the export of tax/rex mrna molecules from the nucleus by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . although tax/rex mrna is the only known transcript which is retained in the nucleus by p <dig>  we hypothesized that other cellular transcripts might also be subject to this virus-mediated rna retention mechanism. to investigate whether the export of any cellular rna transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was inhibited by p <dig>  we isolated rna from the cytoplasmic fraction of cells in parallel with our total rna extractions described above. to ascertain the relative purity of cytoplasmic fractions, proteins were isolated following rna extraction and analyzed by western blotting for known nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, cyclin a and bax, respectively  <cit> . the cytoplasmic fraction was relatively free of cyclin a, while the nuclear fraction was correspondingly free of cytoplasmic bax protein, as expected .

extracted rna samples were then subjected to microarray analysis. to identify those transcripts that p <dig> might inhibit the export of, we first selected transcripts that were present in equal abundance in total rna fractions from cells either plus or minus p <dig>  the data were then re-sorted based on the relative decrease in abundance of transcripts in the cytoplasmic fraction in the presence of p <dig>  by ensuring that transcripts were present in the total rna fraction in both the presence and absence of p <dig>  any difference seen in cytoplasmic abundance of a particular transcript would not be the result of a general inhibition of transcription by p <dig>  this parallels the repression of tax mrna export, where tax mrna is decreased in cytoplasmic rna fractions in the presence of p <dig>  but total tax mrna levels are unchanged  <cit> . in our screen,  <dig> transcripts were decreased by more than  <dig>  fold , and another  <dig> transcripts showed a decreased cytoplasmic abundance of more than  <dig>  fold in the presence of p <dig> . classes of transcripts exhibiting lower abundance in the cytoplasm in the presence of p <dig> include genes involved in transcription/translation, cell signalling, the cytoskeleton, dna repair and replication, and metabolism.

of the genes we identified, those of particular interest with respect to htlv and the onset of leukemia include mdm <dig>  a known regulator of p <dig>  <cit> , and the single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein rbms <dig>  which has also been linked to transcription and apoptosis  <cit> . we also found that histone deacetylase hdac <dig> was repressed by p <dig>  hdac <dig> is known to form multi-protein complexes with the co-repressors smrt and n-cor and regulates the transcription of numerous genes  <cit> . in addition, hdac <dig> has multiple functions that relate to htlv-i infected cells. hdac <dig> regulates the duration of nf-kb activation by deacetylation of rela thereby promoting its interaction with inhibitory-kb  and termination of nf-kb signalling  <cit> . hdac <dig> has also been found to deacetylate acetyltransferases pcaf and p300/cbp and inhibit their function  <cit> . since both pcaf and p300/cbp are required for tax-mediated viral transcription, it makes sense that p <dig> would block this pathway. finally, downregulation of hdac <dig> below threshold induces g2/m arrest, a phenotype previously observed in cells overexpressing p <dig>  <cit> . these observations warrant further studies. our results also indicate a decreased expression of nup <dig>  a nucleoporin protein involved in mrna export  <cit> . this is of particular interest because of our previous work demonstrating a nuclear retention of tax/rex mrna by p <dig> that is currently under investigation  <cit> .

we then re-sorted the data to examine whether any genes showed an increased abundance in the cytoplasm in the presence of p <dig>  intriguingly, despite the role of p <dig> as an inhibitor of tax mrna export, we observed  <dig> genes that showed an increased abundance of more than  <dig>  fold in the cytoplasm in the presence of p <dig> , and another  <dig> genes increased in the cytoplasm more than  <dig>  fold . these probes were present in equal quantities in the total rna fractions, indicating that their increased abundance in the cytoplasm was not due to an altered expression pattern at the transcriptional level. of particular interest are groups of genes involved in dna replication and repair, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cell signalling, all of which are known classes of genes to be intimately linked with the onset of cancer. again, none of the genes identified in our screen were previously shown to be significantly altered in atl cells  <cit> . upregulated genes include two rab gtpases, which are believed to play a role in oncogenesis  <cit> , and ccar <dig>  which is involved in gene expression and functions as a p <dig> coactivator  <cit> . other genes observed to be increased between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold include xrcc <dig> binding protein- <dig>  which parallels a previous observation describing an increase in abundance of xrcc <dig> dna repair gene in atl cells  <cit> . we also observed granzyme b and perforin to be up-regulated in the cytoplasm of p30-expressing cells, contrasting a decrease in the expression of granzyme a in atl cells  <cit> . whether these cytotoxic molecules are involved in the pathogenesis or development of disease in htlv-i-infected t-cells remains to be investigated.

discussion
the regulation of viral and cellular transcripts is of great importance, particularly with respect to latent viruses that persist in the human host for extended periods of time. in the case of adult t-cell leukemia, leukemic cells are infected with htlv-i and contain the proviral genome, but there is extremely little expression of viral transcripts. despite being a non-structural protein that localizes to the nucleolus, the htlv-i accessory protein p <dig> is required for efficient infection in vivo  <cit> . recent studies by our group and others have since shown that p <dig> acts as a negative regulator of virus expression by inhibiting the nuclear export of tax/rex mrna  <cit> . additional studies have reported that p <dig> is a transcriptional inhibitor of the viral ltr. in addition to regulating the export of tax/rex mrna to the cytoplasm, p <dig> expression modifies a number of signalling pathways such as tlr <dig>  creb, and gsk3β  <cit> . how p <dig> accomplishes these changes in the cell is currently unknown. p <dig> has, however, been documented to facilitate transcription from cellular and viral promoters in conjunction with the transcriptional coactivator p300/cbp  <cit> . thus, similar to another nucleolar protein, nucleolin, p <dig> possesses both transcriptional and posttranscriptional activities. the combination of these effects likely decrease tax and other viral antigen expression, possibly permitting htlv-i infected cells to remain hidden from the immune response.

in this study, we used a genome wide analysis to investigate the effect of p <dig> on host cell gene regulation and found a number of cellular transcripts to be increased or decreased . these genes belonged to a variety of families, including transcriptional/translational control, cell cycle, dna replication and repair, and cell signalling. while it is not yet known whether changes in expression of any of these genes identified here, alone or in combination, are required for cell transformation induced by htlv-i, some have been shown to have altered expression patterns in acute atl, such as pdcd <dig>   <dig> kda heat-shock protein, rna polymerase ii , regulator of g-protein signalling, general transcription factor iih, and bcl- <dig>  <cit> . considering the possibility that p <dig> plays a role in the onset of atl in htlv-i-infected individuals, some of the genes regulated by p <dig> may be involved in the process of cell transformation.

using a different experimental approach which relied upon long-term stable expression of p <dig> in jurkat lymphocytes, it was previously shown that p <dig> alters the general abundance of a number of cellular genes  <cit> . several of the transcripts shown previously to be down-regulated were indeed seen in our array as also being negatively regulated by p <dig>  but the difference was less than a  <dig> -fold change in expression. the differences between these reports are not surprising given the differences in the methodology and cell lines used for these two experiments. while our study used a short-term lentiviral infection and co-transduction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, michael et al. used a long-term lentiviral transduction of jurkat t-lymphocytes. it is also worthwhile to consider that long-term p <dig> expression has been documented to induce cell cycle alterations, which may also lead to different changes in gene expression  <cit> . considering the differences, both studies are beneficial to help understand the role that p <dig> plays in modulating gene expression.

the main objective of this study was to evaluate whether any cellular genes were regulated post-transcriptionally by p <dig>  in much the same way that p <dig> regulates tax expression by preventing tax/rex mrna export to the cytoplasm. while it is not yet known exactly how p <dig> inhibits the export of tax/rex mrna, we hypothesized that p <dig> would alter the cytoplasmic abundance of cellular transcripts. in fact, we observed a number of cellular transcripts that showed either a decreased or increased abundance in the cytoplasm . while none of these genes were previously identified as being regulated in atl samples, this was to be expected since in our experimental approach the total abundance of the genes characterized in tables  <dig> and  <dig> was unchanged and only cytoplasmic abundance was affected.

so how does p <dig> inhibit mrna export into the cytoplasm? it is possible that p <dig> somehow modulates the activity of a cellular export mechanism. if this were the case, this might explain why a variety of cellular transcripts were altered in cytoplasmic abundance, indicative of a global effect. alternatively, p <dig> may bind to mrna transcripts to prevent their association with nuclear export proteins, and cellular transcripts that are inhibited may share sequence or secondary structural similarities with the tax/rex mrna. it has been hypothesized that p <dig> may function by binding to both rna and to rex, another htlv-i protein that is conversely responsible for up-regulating tax/rex mrna export from the nucleus  <cit> . indeed, there is evidence to suggest that p <dig> does bind to rna  <cit> , and that p <dig> might recognize a particular rna sequence that is present in the tax-rex message, a short  <dig> base pair response element present specifically at the tax/rex splice junction  <cit> . whether these interactions are required for the inhibition of tax/rex mrna export is not currently known. in the current study, rex was not expressed, suggesting that p <dig> can function in the absence of rex. as a result, it is more likely that p <dig> might have a broad mechanism of action that applies to a number of transcripts.

on the other hand it is also possible that p <dig> directly or indirectly alters regulation or function of rna export machinery. in this way p <dig> may actually only alter the expression or export of a few genes. the altered expression of these, in turn, might then be required for the normal expression of remaining transcripts shown to be altered in the presence of p <dig>  future work is required to examine the effects of p <dig> at the level of protein expression of candidate proteins. another possibility explaining the function of p <dig> involves the binding and alteration of known cellular proteins involved in rna modification and transport. again, if p <dig> alters a known cellular mrna trafficking pathway, it would not come as a surprise to observe so many cellular rna transcripts as having altered expression patterns, both in total rna samples and in cytoplasmic fractions.

following binding to rna, p <dig> might then prevent the subsequent docking and function of splicing and/or mrna export factors. whether p <dig> recognizes the sequence of this region or recognizes a secondary rna structure is not known. indeed, such regulation has been reported for how the retroviral htlv rex protein and hiv rev protein interact with their respective rna binding sites  <cit> . while there are no sequence similarities between the rex responsive element  and the rev responsive element , hiv rev functionally interacts with both sites while rex is specific for the rexre. computer prediction of secondary structures of numerous mrna transcripts using specific software is not an easy task but warrants future study.

whether p <dig> interacts with rna in a sequence-specific or secondary structure-specific manner, there may exist similarities between the tax/rex message and those transcripts down-regulated in the cytoplasm , and examining these similarities will likely be the subject of future work. in addition, such an analysis may lead to the identification of an rna binding motif in the p <dig> protein. if such a motif were found, it could also possibly lead to identification of therapeutic agents that could target such a binding motif in p <dig>  by impairing the function of p <dig>  one could hope to break latency and increase tax expression in htlv-infected patients, leading to the increased detection of infected cells by the immune system and the eventual clearance of infected cells from the body. this could perhaps provide an effective therapy for htlv-i-infected individuals, thereby protecting patients from developing atl later in life.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our data demonstrate that the expression of numerous cellular genes is affected by htlv-i p <dig> either at the transcriptional or at the post-transcriptional  level suggesting that p <dig> may alter normal cellular homeostasis and favour transformation.
