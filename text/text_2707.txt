BACKGROUND
islands provide many of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. they continuously generate new species with the term “speciation machines” having been coined to describe this phenomenon  <cit> . these high speciation rates are facilitated by specific island characteristics that lead to a wealth of ecological, biogeographic and evolutionary processes. these include: natural fragmentation, long term isolation, high altitudes creating habitat heterogeneity, complex intra-island landscapes, and island emergence due to volcanism and eustatic sea-level changes.

the mediterranean basin was one of the first  <dig> global biodiversity hotspots to be named  <cit>  and is characterized by substantial island diversity  <cit> . the tyrrhenian region within the mediterranean is particularly diverse due to the influence of complex paleogeographical and historical factors  <cit> . it includes sardinia and corsica, two of the largest and highest , mediterranean islands, which are separated by a strait of only 11 km. they contain high levels of endemism including several hundred endemic plants. geological history has undoubtedly played a role in generating this diversity. a land bridge maintained the connection between the islands and europe  <cit>  until their separation, completed 9 ma ago  <cit> . this was subsequently lost although connections between the corsica–sardinia archipelago and europe and north africa were re-established through desiccation of the mediterranean basin during the messinian salinity crisis   <cit> . corsica and sardinia have since been temporarily connected as a result of more minor changes in sea level during glacial periods in the pleistocene, with the last contact being during the last glacial maximum   <cit> .

the lizard genus podarcis encompasses about  <dig> species and is widespread across the mediterranean. podarcis tiliguerta is endemic to corsica and sardinia. it exhibits a great intraspecific variability in morphological traits, especially colour pattern and melanism, the latter found within populations from small islands away from the main islands . this variation has led to the description of several microinsular subspecies  <cit> . morphological  <cit>  and genetic studies, based on both allozymes  <cit>  and mitochondrial sequences , have evidenced the existence of two or possibly three divergent genetic clusters within the corsica-sardinia archipelago. the underlying reasons for this divergence remain unexplained, but its magnitude has led some authors to suggest that p. tiliguerta might represent an insular species complex  <cit> . similar findings have been documented for other podarcis from much wider geographic areas, e.g., p. hispanica, from the iberian peninsula  <cit>  and p. erhardii, from greece  <cit> . objective coalescent-based statistical analyses of species delimitation may provide an important step towards robust assignment of new taxonomic units based on genetic groups within the putative complex.

this study aims to provide the most detailed analysis of genetic variation of p. tiliguerta to date, using both mitochondrial  and nuclear dna  markers. we use these data to reveal new insights into the patterns and causes of the genetic diversity. we examine two important aspects of the evolutionary history of p. tiliguerta, namely the number of lineages and timing of divergence between these lineages and from other podarcis. in addition, we investigate the historical biogeography of p. tiliguerta in relation to known physical changes in the region.

methods
sampling
forty-one podarcis tiliguerta were captured under license from  <dig> localities in corsica,  <dig> localities in sardinia  and four offshore islands and islets  by noosing, with the aim of covering the main geographical regions . tail-tips were removed and stored in 100% ethanol before releasing individuals at sites of capture.fig.  <dig> sites at which podarcis tiliguerta were sampled in corsica, sardinia and adjacent islands





dna amplification and sequencing
a standard phenol-chloroform protocol was used for dna extraction  <cit> . six non-overlapping mtdna fragments were amplified and sequenced for each specimen containing sequences from the following genes: i) partial 12s rrna, ii) partial trnaglu and partial cytochrome b , iii) partial cytb and partial trnathr, iv) partial control region , v) two partial subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase gene and associated trnas  and vi) partial 16s rrna. primers and amplification conditions are the same as those used in our previous studies of podarcis  , with the exception of the light strand primer  for amplification of fragment   in the sardinian specimens. the 16s rrna primers were obtained from carranza et al.  <cit> .

six partial nuclear genes were sequenced: i) melanocortin- <dig> receptor gene , ii) recombination-activating gene  <dig> , iii) apolipoprotein b gene apobe <dig>  iv) lipoprotein gene blc9l, v) transcription factor gene kiaa <dig> and vi) kinesin family member kif <dig>  primers  are described in additional file  <dig> 

sequencing of both strands of pcr products was carried out on an automated abi  <dig> sequencer  using a bigdye® terminator v.  <dig>  cycle sequencing kit , and edited and aligned using bioedit v. <dig> . <dig> .  <cit> .

analyses of genetic variability and structuring
dnasp v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to obtain basic genetic diversity indices, test for neutrality and phase nuclear data. potential recombination events were assessed using the pairwise homoplasy index  test  <cit>  implemented in splitstree v.  <dig>  <cit> .

relationships between nuclear dna haplotypes were explored using statistical parsimony networks, with a 95% connection limit .

analysis of molecular variance   was used to examine genetic structuring between primary geographic groups .

bayesian phylogeographical and ecological clustering   <cit>  was used to identify genetically distinct geographical population clusters in corsica and sardinia. bpec relies on parsimony in order to reduce the number of candidate trees. different haplotype trees and migration events are explored through the markov chain monte carlo  sampler. migration events are assumed to occur when a haplotype  migrates to a new geographical cluster. locations were specified as latitudes and longitudes recorded during fieldwork using a motion x-gps hd v <dig>  build 1737r . for each run, a strict parsimony criterion was applied and the maximum number of migrations was  <dig>  the mcmc chain was run for  <dig> million iterations with  <dig>  steps saved. separate analyses were performed on corsica and sardinia. a subsample of  <dig> mtdna sites were selected for this analysis due to high levels of mtdna divergence . the analysed sequence comprised: 12s rrna , cr  and cytb codon positions  <dig> and  <dig> . the geographical distributions of alleles were similarly analyzed for each nuclear locus, independently.

for comparison, an alternative genetic clustering procedure implemented within the program baps v. <dig>   <cit>  was used to infer population structure without reference to geographical location. it was applied to all nuclear markers together, and to mtdna alone. the number of clusters was determined and admixture analyses were executed to infer the ancestral source of the samples .

species phylogeny, divergence times and species delimitation
the multispecies coalescent approach implemented in *beast v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> ; was used to estimate divergence times and phylogenetic relationship between specific mitochondrial lineages from the main islands, corsica and sardinia . the method allows estimation of divergence times while taking into account ancestral polymorphism. however, it often suffers from problems associated with prior specifications  <cit>  and achieving good mixing of the mcmc chain . also, the inclusion of several poorly informative nuclear markers could have a substantial and potentially undesirable impact on the estimated divergence times  <cit> . for these reasons, we included only mtdna in the analysis.

eight partitions were used to account for heterogeneity in sequence evolution and suitable models for each partition were identified using jmodeltest v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  . we partitioned the sequence by grouping functionally similar sites from specific regions as they should have similar properties . these were: i) 12s rrna, ii) cr, iii) all trnas, iv) 1st and 2nd codon positions of the nd1/nd <dig> sequences, v) 3rd codon position of nd1/nd <dig>  vi) 1st codon position of cytb, vii) 2nd codon position of cytb, viii) 3rd codon position of cytb, when the selected model was not available in *beast, we used the most similar available model.

we included mtdna from all p. tiliguerta samples together with homologous sequences from two species that comprise a sister lineage to p. tiliguerta: p. lilfordi and p. pityusensis  <cit> . inclusion of these taxa allowed incorporation of a time-calibrated node in the analysis  <cit>  . the age of the  node on the population was constrained using the normal distribution n , where  <dig> unit = 1 ma. the msc is a well-known physical event in the mediterranean and ended with very rapidly rising sea levels after the opening of the mediterranean-atlantic connection. some studies have suggested that refilling of the basin may have only taken only a few thousand years  <cit> . this would have separated the gymnesic and pityusic islands. evidence from other studies  indicates the suitability of narrow time constraints on  nodes. refilling has been dated at  <dig>  ma  <cit>  and given the deep intermediate channel between the island groups and the evidence of a very rapid refilling of the basin, the narrow normal distribution around a mean of  <dig>  ma would appear suitable.

a strict clock model was used in *beast , and the tree prior was specified by a yule process. the mcmc chain was run for  <dig> million generations sampled every  <dig>  steps. tracer v.  <dig>   <cit>  allowed visual inspection of marginal posteriors. treeannotator  was used to combine and analyse the posterior tree samples at stationarity .

species delimitation was examined using three different approaches. first the bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography program   <cit>  was used to obtain posterior probabilities on specified nodes. bpp implements a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo  to search the parameter space that includes θpopulation divergence and gene trees. analyses were performed with i) mtdna, ii) ndna and iii) all markers, to determine the impact of mtdna polymorphism on species delimitation. gamma distributions  with the following shape and different scale parameters were used to specify the population size, θs: g τ <dig> g , θs g τ <dig> g, θs g τ <dig> g , θs g τ <dig> g . the mcmc chain was run for  <dig>  steps , sampled every  <dig> steps. each analysis was run three times to confirm consistency between runs.

two additional approaches of species delimitation analysis suitable for single locus data  were also tested. the poisson tree processes model   <cit>  uses non-ultrametric phylogenetic trees and directly incorporates the number of nucleotide substitution in the model of speciation using a poisson distribution to describe the probability that a substitution gives rise to a speciation event. this method delimits species under the assumption that the number of substitutions between species is considerably higher than within species. the branch lengths of the input tree are supposed to be generated by two independent classes of poisson events, one corresponding to speciation and the other to coalescence. a bptp analysis  was conducted on the bptp web server . a phylogenetic tree inferred by iq-tree  <cit>  was used as input. the chain was run for  <dig>  mcmc generations, 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in and sampling interval was  <dig> 

finally gmyc  <cit> , based on time-calibrated ultrametric phylogenetic trees and using differences in branching rates to infer species was applied. the input tree was generated in beast v <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  and the specifications were the same as the ones described above for the *beast analysis . independent mcmc runs of  <dig> million steps were sampled every  <dig>  steps . the gmyc analysis was conducted using this consensus tree and the single-threshold method within the splits package  <cit>  on r v  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

length polymorphisms were detected in three nuclear genes, including strs  and indels . we briefly describe them here. the kiaa <dig> sequence contained a polymorphic microsatellite with a proline repeat  ranging from 4- <dig>  the  <dig> repeat was the most frequent . only three individuals showed an amino acid change within this repeat. these were: i) two sardinian samples tsa <dig>  and tsa <dig>  showed a leucine substitution in the fifth repeat, and ii) the corsica sample tco <dig> showed eight repeats with a threonine substitution in the final repeat. an str was also observed within the blc9l sequence with a variable number of repeats for glutamine and proline. the common structure was 3- <dig> 5- <dig>  <dig> with the unique exception of a corsican sample  that showed an histidine:  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  three different indels were detected in kif <dig> sequences: i) a 9 bp deletion  in specimen tsa <dig> and ii) a 12 bp insertion  in tsa1– <dig>  tsa <dig>  tsa <dig> and tf1– <dig>  iii) 6 bp deletions  in tco <dig> and tco10; and  in tco <dig>  note that i) and ii) occurred only in sardinia, while iii) occurred only in corsica.

genetic structure of the insular populations
the mtdna variance was partitioned as  <dig> %  between corsica and sardinia  and the remaining variance within these regions . baps analysis of the mtdna locus defined five genetic clusters  . the analysis distinguishes three corsican groups: i) cluster a includes lizards from the south-western region , ii) cluster b includes lizards from the south-east  and iii) cluster c includes lizards from the north of corsica . two sardinian clusters are identified: cluster d includes specimens corresponding to localities in the south of the island  and cluster e contains p. tiliguerta from sardinian islands and islets  and from the north of the main island .fig.  <dig> overall genetic structure inferred from a) mtdna and b) concatenated nuclear loci across the two main geographic regions used in this study. mixture analyses were estimated by baps software. in the bar plot, vertical bars represent individuals and proportions of admixture, with colours corresponding to ancestral sources




amova of the nuclear loci indicated that  <dig> %  of the variance occurred between corsica and sardinia  with most of the variance being within these regions. only two genetic clusters were defined by a baps analysis of concatenated ndna . the first included all corsican individuals, and the second included sardinian and individuals from small islet populations . the tcs analysis indicated that two loci  show star-like parsimony networks, with a main haplotype shared by corsican and sardinian samples, and derived haplotypes belonging to both islands . in contrast, rag <dig> and blc9l show compound star-like networks consisting of two central haplotypes, corresponding to corsica and sardinia, separated by one mutational step. finally, the two other networks  exhibit a clear separation between corsican and sardinian samples, together with a much higher differentiation between haplotypes . the kiaa <dig> sequences show greatest diversity of all nuclear loci analysed, characterised by  <dig> different haplotypes.fig.  <dig> nuclear haplotype networks for podarcis tiliguerta





mitochondrial haplotypes from sardinia were assigned by bpec to three phylogeographic clusters with high posterior probabilities  , with most likely ancestral locations being gallura, villasimius and costa rei . three clusters were also obtained for corsica  with likely ancestral locations being sant bastiano, corte and vivario . low posterior cluster assignment probabilities were obtained for eight corsican haplotypes , and one sardinian  haplotype. geographical structuring in corsica corresponded to the north, south-east and south-west of the island, while in sardinia three geographical groupings were detected: i) north , ii) south and iii) foradada island . bpec analyses of nuclear loci assigned haplotypes to four phylogeographic clusters with generally high posterior probabilities: two of them, in corsica and two, in sardinia . however all nuclear genes divide the main islands into northern and southern regions.fig.  <dig> analyses of bayesian phylogeographical and ecological clustering : a) using mtdna or b) rag <dig> as example of nuclear dna. each coloured contour plot indicates a different phylogeographical clusters. the contour plots are centred at the ‘centre’ of each population cluster, and the coloured regions show the radius of 50% concentration contours around it. white arrows show the ancestral locations with the highest posterior probability for each island




species phylogeny, divergence times and species delimitation
preliminary gene tree analyses were performed on all individual loci prior to the bayesian multispecies coalescent analysis. these analyses ruled out the possibility that p. tiliguerta was polyphyletic relative to the other closely related taxa that were included  .

the species tree , based on mtdna, provided a posterior mean for the divergence of p. tiliguerta from  at  <dig>  ma , and that for the divergence of corsica and sardinia lineages, at  <dig>  ma .fig.  <dig> mitochondrial populations tree chronogram estimated by *beast in p. tiliguerta. p. lilfordi and p. pityusensis are used as outgroups. grey bars correspond to the 95% highest posterior density intervals for each divergence time




all bpp analyses supported the two species  model  irrespective of the prior specifications for θs and τ <dig> and whether mtdna was included or excluded from the analyses.

the trees obtained from the bptp analysis   showed  <dig> groups with high posterior probabilities . of the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> comprised only  <dig> sample. the gmyc approach detected  <dig> clusters within p. tiliguerta with a total of  <dig> entities, excluding outgroups and with posterior probabilities ≥  <dig> . the different clusters detected by these two analyses corresponded to different clades detected within corsica and sardinian islands, but none of these groups comprised both corsica and sardinia individuals, further supporting species delimitation of these two island forms. additional information about ptp and gmyc analyses is available on request.

discussion
the most striking finding is the high degree of genetic variability detected within the taxon podarcis tiliguerta. this has already been suggested by two previous studies that analysed protein mobility and mtdna  <cit> . other insular mediterranean species, such as p. pityusensis, p. lilfordi or p. filfolensis show lower levels of divergence, although they inhabit smaller islands. for exemple, the mean pairwise differences for comparable mtdna regions is more than four times higher than in p. lilfordi, and is almost  <dig> times greater than in p. filfolensis or p. pityusensis. in addition, intraspecific ndna variability also appears to be greater p. tiliguerta than in other podarcis which confirms the extreme genetic diversity observed within this species  <cit> .

the high diversity is primarily accounted for by strong geographical structuring with a deep, ancient divergence between corsican and sardinia lineages as well as substantial within-island divergence. early analyses of allozymes and short mtdna fragments indicated two genetic groupings: corsica and sardinia  <cit> . subsequent analyses, with wider sampling, revealed three mtdna groups: two in sardinia and one in corsica  <cit> . here, we detect three geographically-structured mtdna groups within corsica, corresponding to the north, south-east and south-west of the island. we also detect two/three  spatial groupings of mtdna within sardinia: one of which corresponds to the north of the main island and associated smaller islands, while the other corresponds to the south.

as expected, the nuclear data detected fewer clusters. the baps analyses revealed two groups: corsica and sardinia, while the slightly more sensitive bpec analyses revealed two additional clusters within each island. bruschi et al.  <cit>  studied p. tiliguerta using morphological characters and suggested hybridization was occurring in southern corsican populations due to introductions of individuals from sardinia which might contribute to these patterns. however, our nuclear and mtdna analyses found no evidence of this. although some nuclear alleles were shared between corsican and sardinian populations, the lack of any such patterns in the mtdna suggests that incomplete lineage sorting is the most likely cause.

the ancestral species node for p. tiliguerta was dated at  <dig>  ma  confirming preliminary divergence time estimates   <cit> . p. pityusensis and p. lilfordi are related species to p. tiliguerta, including all them in the named “western islands group”  <cit> . this clearly predates the intraspecific divergence within: i) p. lilfordi which dates to the early pleistocene  <cit> , ii) p. filfolensis which also diverged in the pleistocene  <cit>  and iii) p. pityusensis which diverged in the mid-late pleistocene  <cit> . the divergence time between corsica and sardinia far exceeds the usual limits for distinct species within the squamata  <cit> . reciprocal monophylia between the islands was found for several loci, which supports our detection of species delimitation . this, and the general concordance with and among nuclear markers, explains why our species delimitation analysis provides such strong support for separation of p. tiliguerta into two species. in a future study we intend to provide formal  descriptions of these new taxa.


p. tiliguerta appears to have originated by allopatric speciation, from continental ancestors that colonized the corsica-sardinia microplate. according to arnold et al.  <cit> , the lacertini spread and diversified around 16–12 ma bp producing the ancestors of the present genera, so genus origin postdates the isolation of the corsica-sardinia microplate from the iberian plate . this indicates that the ancestors reached it subsequently via the land bridge that it maintained with the continent during its rotation. later, the microplate split into two islands  leading to isolation of the sardinian and corsican lineages, concordant with our divergence time estimate. since separation, the heterogeneous orography of corsica and sardinia could have played an important role in determining intraspecific diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we analysed mtdna and nuclear markers in p. tiliguerta and found high genetic variability and a deep genetic structure, corresponding to deep miocene divergence between corsica and sardinia. in addition, we detected substantial within-island divergence but were unable to relate it to any geological or other events in the islands past. this study will motivate and contribute evidence to a taxonomic reassessment of p. tiliguerta with respect to the corsican and sardinian forms.
