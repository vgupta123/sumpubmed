BACKGROUND
genomic imprinting is an unusual epigenetic phenomenon that results in the absence of expression of one copy of an autosomal gene. this allele-specific expression is initiated by events that take place within the male and female germ line during gametogenesis  <cit> . the parental alleles acquire an epigenetic signature that is recognised in the somatic cell and, as a result, there is permanent and heritable silencing of one parental allele. studies on imprinted genes in mice suggest a general role for imprinting in the regulation of embryonic growth  <cit> . two key genes that regulate embryonic growth, insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  and insulin-like growth factor receptor  <dig>  are oppositely imprinted. in mice, insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  and the imprinted igf <dig> are thought to be the two major growth signalling molecules. these factors work in combination with at least three receptors, the insulin receptor , insulin-like growth factor receptor  <dig>  and the imprinted igf2r to exert local and systemic effects on growth  <cit> .

single genetic or epigenetic changes can deregulate the function of an imprinted gene and they are particularly vulnerable targets for numerous human pathologies .

while studies on loss of function are important for our understanding of gene function by itself, over expression studies may provide more unequivocal information on the significance of imprinting of a particular gene. biallelic gene expression can be studied in mice with uniparental disomy  <cit>  or in mice where a targeted deletion of an imprinting centre  has released genes from imprinting  <cit> . these studies generally involve multiple genes and, in regions where there are both paternally and maternally expressed genes, can also involve loss of expression. the primary advantage of using large genomic clones to analyse imprinted genes is that the exact nature and number of genes is defined by the transgenic sequence, there is no loss of expression and the genes are expressed from their endogenous promoters at the appropriate level and time, predominantly without being affected by the site of integration  <cit> .

cdkn1c, also known as p57kip <dig>  encodes a maternally expressed, cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor   <cit> . expression is tissue-specific and at high levels in cells entering mitotic arrest  <cit> . loss of expression of cdkn1c through maternal inheritance of a targeted deletion results in severe developmental abnormalities  <cit> , similar to that seen in humans with loss of cdkn1c in beckwith-wiedemann syndrome   <cit> . as with all cdkis, excess cdkn1c induces cell cycle arrest  <cit> . forced expression of cdkn1c in retinal cultures leads to premature cell cycle exit  <cit>  and cdkn1c co-expression with nurr <dig> promotes maturation of a midbrain dopaminergic neuronal cell line  <cit>  demonstrating a role for cdkn1c in both cell cycle regulation and cellular differentiation.

the cdkn1c gene is located within a large cluster of imprinted genes on mouse distal chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . maternal disomy of this region results in embryonic and extra embryonic growth retardation and embryonic lethality  <cit> . there are two ics within this domain controlling two mechanistically distinct sub domains  <cit> . imprinting of cdkn1c is achieved through ic <dig>  also known as kvdmr <dig>  <cit>  and mice paternally inheriting a targeted deletion of the kvdmr <dig> locus show growth retardation. growth retardation is also associated with maternal transmission of an  <dig> kb yac transgene spanning eleven genes from nap1l <dig> to th but excluding the ic <dig> domain  <cit> . all these studies involve multiple imprinted genes and dissecting which gene is responsible for a particular phenotype is not straightforward. nonetheless, the proportionality of the growth retardation in all these mice suggests a systemic effect on growth. since igf <dig>  which encodes a potent embryonic mitogen, is unaffected by the kvdmr <dig> deletion, one or more of the other deregulated genes may play a novel role in regulating whole organism growth.

in this study, we characterised the phenotype of mice carrying different copy number integrations of a bacterial artificial chromosome spanning cdkn1c. we show copy-number dependent embryonic growth retardation that is most severe on the 129/sv genetic background. by using a modified bac transgene spanning the same genomic region but with an inactivated cdkn1c, we can assign the embryonic phenotype to cdkn1c alone. these data indicate that cdkn1c encodes the most important regulator of embryonic growth within the ic <dig> domain on mouse distal chromosome  <dig> 

RESULTS
excess cdkn1c causes embryonic lethality
following on from our previous work on studying the mechanism of imprinting of cdkn1c  <cit> , we investigated the consequences of over expressing cdkn1c in vivo on development. we generated transgenic mice carrying an  <dig> kb bacterial artificial chromosome  spanning the cdkn1c locus  <cit>  . when es cell lines with low copy number insertions of this transgene  were aggregated with mf <dig> morulae, there was a high incidence of perinatal loss . no live born chimeras were obtained for high copy lines . when surviving chimeras from four independent lines were crossed to out bred mf <dig> females, transgenic offspring were detected at the expected frequency . when these same chimeras were crossed with 129/sv females, transgenics were recovered at low frequency in a single copy line  and not at all in three other lines containing 2– <dig> copies of the transgene . we examined litters at earlier time points and dying transgenic embryos were observed at varying stages, some as early as e <dig>  .

129/sv es were aggregated with mf <dig> morula to generate chimaeric animals containing both es cells  and the host mf <dig> cells . the contribution of es to the adult chimera was estimated by the percentage of agouti in the coat colour and found to decrease with increasing copy number. additionally, 50%  of the pups with dark eyes , indicating a strong contribution of es cells, were born dead or die shortly after birth.

n.t. = not tested.

the transgene was present at the expected frequency  when chimeras were mated with mf <dig> females but there was a significant reduction in survival of transgenics for single copy line 5d <dig>  and no survivors for the other lines when chimaeras were crossed with inbred 129/sv females. f <dig> males from line 5d <dig>  were backcrossed onto 129/sv for three generations . at which point significant lethality was again noted . the modified transgene  bred six generations into the 129/sv background showed no significant difference in survival .

we have previously shown that the transgenic cdkn1c transcript is expressed only in a subset of tissues from this  <dig> kb bac at e <dig>  by in situ hybridisation  <cit> . immunohistochemistry with a cdkn1c-specific antibody showed a similarly restricted distribution of the cdkn1c protein at e <dig> , mainly to neural tissues . real time rt-pcr measurements of the cdkn1c transcript revealed an increase in the overall expression of  <dig> -fold in whole embryos carrying a single copy of the bac transgene  and  <dig> -fold in embryos carrying two copies  at e <dig>  . this reflects the restricted expression from the bac which we confirmed in e <dig>  embryos by comparing the levels of expression in the head versus the body in the single copy line . this is consistent with expression from the single-copy transgene at levels similar to the endogenous gene in neural tissues where we know the transgenic cdkn1c to be expressed. we were not able to detect over expression of cdkn1c in the body. we know from our in situ data, immunohistochemistry and a reporter transgene  <cit>  that cdkn1c is expression from the bac in only a subset of the non-neuronal tissues where endogenous cdkn1c is expressed such as the lung endothelium and the developing kidney tubules. the endogenous cdkn1c is expressed most strongly in skeletal muscle and cartilage, where we do not see expression from our transgene. this very strong expression maybe masking the more subtle changes in tissues where there is a relatively lower level expression of cdkn1c. these data are consistent with copy-number dependent expression of cdkn1c from the bac in a subset of tissues.

growth is exquisitely sensitive to the dosage of cdkn1c
the transgenic offspring from the cross between the chimeric males and the mf <dig> females were noticeably smaller than their wild type littermates. the degree of growth retardation increased with increasing copy number of the transgene and persisted after weaning . persistent growth retardation was also observed when the single copy transgene was bred onto the c57/bl <dig> background for three generation .

the degree of growth retardation also varied with strain background. transgenic f <dig> males  from a single copy line, 5d <dig>  were  <dig> % smaller at three weeks but when these males were crossed with 129/sv females, the transgenic f <dig> male offspring  were 29% smaller than their non-transgenic litter mates . generation  <dig> c57b/l <dig> males showed an intermediate phenotype of 20% growth retardation at this time point . in contrast the lethality associated with an increasing contribution of the 129/sv genetic background, no evidence of lethality was associated with the presence of a single copy of the transgene on the c57bl/ <dig> background .

we examined the age at which males acquired sexual maturity as judged by the timing of their first mating. despite their small size, transgenic male adult mice reached sexual maturity at the same time as wild type littermates and were fertile . the majority of females also reached sexual maturity at a similar age to their wild type littermates but there was one female that had a litter late and two that did not have litters during the time of observation . those that had litters were able to nest and feed their offspring. it should be noted that there is variable fertility in the rare surviving females that are deficient in cdkn1c  <cit> . the cdkn1c-deficient mice also show a severe postnatal growth defect. this is consistent with a defect in pituitary development. it is possible that, given the expression of cdkn1c from our transgene in the pituitary, further studies on transgenics animals with a higher 129/sv genetic contribution might reveal an endocrine defect in adults and this is under investigation.

there was no significance difference in time to first plug between transgenic males and wild type littermates . transgenic females had their litters slightly later than wild type females. although this difference did not show up as significant , there was a large variation in timing within the transgenic females from  <dig> to  <dig> days. furthermore, two females in this study never became pregnant.

cdkn1c is a cell cycle inhibitor that acts intrinsically to limit cell proliferation. we would expect that the tissues in which there was excess cdkn1c would be disproportionately smaller than those without. we examined the weights of organs with no excess cdkn1c  and those in which there had been excess embryonic cdkn1c  in eight-week old males. there were no significant difference in comparison to body weight  between wild type and transgenic males. growth retardation induced by the presence of a single copy bac was not restricted to the tissues in which the transgenic cdkn1c was expressed.

the transgenic embryos were small but similar in appearance to wild type embryos  in all four lines. at e <dig> , transgenic embryos from line 5d <dig>  on a mixed mf1:129/sv background are 14% smaller than wild type . this phenotype is comparable to that reported for the kvdmr <dig> deletion and the  <dig> kb yac where several additional genes are also over expressed  <cit> . in contrast, embryos null for cdkn1c were 11% heavier wild type embryos at e <dig>  .

phenotype is due to excess cdkn1c
the transgene spans two other genes, phlda <dig>   <cit>  and slc22a <dig>   <cit> . the growth retardation and embryonic lethality could be a consequence of over expression of any one of these genes. to test this possibility, we examined the transgenic line, 10– <dig> . this line contains three copies of the same bac but the cdkn1c gene on the bac has been inactivated by the insertion of a reporter gene   <cit> . in these mice, cdkn1c is not over expressed in the embryo . phlda <dig> and slc22a <dig>  which are predominantly expressed in extra embryonic tissues  <cit> , are highly over expressed in the placenta  <cit>  but not detectable in the embryo at e <dig>  .

no embryonic lethality was observed when we first generated this line or when we backcrossed the mice for six generations onto the 129/sv background . this contrasts with almost complete loss of transgenic animals  after crossing 5d <dig> f <dig> males  onto the 129/sv background for three generations . there was no significant difference in weights between males from line 10– <dig>  and wild type littermates at three weeks  and embryos from line 10– <dig>  are not significantly different to their wild type counter parts  at e <dig>  . this line was generated by pronuclear injection and it was possible that we selected against any transgenic lines showing an adverse phenotype. therefore, we also examined embryos at e <dig>  after a second round of pronuclear injection. seven embryos representing independent integration events were identified. no significant difference in embryonic size was noted .

placental insufficiency can also cause embryonic growth retardation in mice as illustrated by the placental specific igf <dig> knock out  <cit> . both the unmodified and modified bac transgenic lines have a placental defect due to excess phlda <dig> and/or slc22a <dig> . in the absence of over expression of cdkn1c in line 10– <dig> , this placental defect leads to a slow down in embryonic growth detectable at e <dig>   <cit> . in the lines with excess cdkn1c, we observe embryonic growth retardation three days earlier, at e <dig> . our control line 10– <dig>  embryos are of normal weight at e <dig>  . therefore, this earlier defect in embryonic growth is due to excess cdkn1c and not due to the placental insufficiency shared by both lines. furthermore, a key characteristic of iugr due to placental insufficiency in mice is postnatal "catch up" growth  <cit> . our mice do not recover their growth potential after birth . even at one year, they are noticeably smaller than their wild type siblings .

we can conclude that excess cdkn1c in the embryo causes sustained growth retardation and, on the 129/sv genetic background, also causes embryonic lethality.

igf <dig> expression is reduced as a consequence of increased cdkn1c levels
cdkn1c acts intrinsically to regulate cell proliferation and, in some tissues, also directs differentiation. however, growth retardation was not limited to the tissues in which there was an embryonic excess cdkn1c. one possible explanation was that excess cdkn1c altered the expression level of one of the key embryonic growth regulatory genes which would then have an extrinsic effect on growth. we used quantitative real time rt-pcr to measure the transcript levels of several genes known to regulate embryonic growth. at e <dig>  we identified a reduction in igf <dig> in our two-copy line but not in our single-copy line. igf <dig> was reduced in both the single-copy and the two-copy transgenic lines at e <dig>  when there was obvious growth retardation . igf <dig> levels were slightly raised at e <dig>  in both lines and reduced at e <dig>  only in the two-copy line .

in the single copy line, we only detected changes in igf <dig> at e <dig> , when the growth retardation phenotype was well established. in order to detect more subtle changes in gene expression at an earlier time point in this line, we examined igf <dig> and igf <dig> levels in rna prepared separately from the head and in the body of e <dig>  embryos. cdkn1c expression from our transgene was predominantly in neural tissues and we reasoned that we would be more likely to detect a change in expression in material where this tissue predominates. when we examined the transgenic embryos, we found that the level of igf <dig> in the head was dramatically reduced to 40% of the wild type level . in the body, where we have minimal over expression of cdkn1c, igf <dig> levels were not significantly changed from normal. the central nervous system is a major site for expression of igf <dig>  <cit> . consistent with this observation, we found that, in wild type embryos, there was  <dig> -fold more igf <dig> rna in the head than in the body at e <dig>  . igf <dig> levels were raised in the head by two-fold and reduced in the body by 50%. since the body  is the primary source of igf <dig>  <cit> , the overall change in expression in the transgenic embryos was not significant.

to provide further data to support a role for igf <dig> in the growth phenotype, we examined igf <dig> and igf <dig> levels in rna prepared from the heads and bodies of embryos null for cdkn1c at e <dig> . we again found changes in the level of expression of igf <dig> with a three-fold increase in igf <dig> expression levels in the head and difference in expression in the body . igf <dig> levels were relatively unchanged in both samples .

we have found an inverse correlation between the level of expression of cdkn1c and the level of expression of the potent growth factor igf <dig>  these data are consistent with a role for this growth factor in our growth phenotype. igf <dig> levels are linked, either directly or indirectly, to level of expression of cdkn1c and growth is either retarded or enhanced as a consequence.

we have shown that cdkn1c acts as a true rheostat for embryonic growth, with loss of expression after gene deletion leading to overgrowth and over expression of cdkn1c causing growth retardation.

discussion
embryonic growth is exquisitely sensitive to the dosage of cdkn1c
excess expression of cdkn1c from a single copy bac transgene resulted in decreased growth of embryos from at least e <dig>  with no catch-up growth after birth. furthermore, as the level of excess cdkn1c increased, the size of the animals decreased. initial reports for the phenotype of cdkn1c null mice did not reveal a clear affect on growth at birth  <cit> . however, we found that loss of cdkn1c was associated with embryonic overgrowth earlier in development, at e <dig> . therefore, cdkn1c acts as a true rheostat for embryonic growth.

cdkn1c is the most important regulator of embryonic growth within the ic <dig> domain
studies on mono-parental embryos and embryos with paternal or maternal disomy of specific chromosomal regions revealed a key role for imprinted genes in regulating embryonic growth. these studies invariably involved both loss of expression and excess expression of multiple genes and the identification of the target for imprinting of the locus is difficult. embryos with maternal disomy of mouse distal chromosome  <dig> showed embryonic and extra embryonic growth retardation and embryonic lethality  <cit>  with loss of expression of igf <dig> and ins <dig> and excess expression of a number of genes presumed to include cdkn1c, ascl <dig> and phlda <dig> . paternal inheritance of a targeted deletion of the kvdmr <dig>  which resulted in loss of imprinting of only the ic <dig> domain, resulted in a slightly less severe growth retardation  <cit>  similar to maternal inheritance of the  <dig> kb yac spanning all the genes within this domain  <cit> . our unmodified bac, which spans only three of these genes, also caused embryonic growth retardation. the modified bac, which drives excess phlda <dig> and slc22a <dig> but not excess cdkn1c, did not. therefore, cdkn1c is the only gene in this region that has been shown to have a major role in regulating embryonic growth.

embryonic lethality in embryos with maternal disomy of the distal  <dig> domain may be due to excess cdkn1c
there are differences in survival between embryos with maternal disomy of distal chromosome  <dig> and those with paternal inheritance of the kvdmr <dig> deletion. this could be interpreted to indicate that the embryonic lethality in the mice with maternal disomy of distal  <dig> was due to loss of igf <dig> and/or ins <dig>  however, embryonic lethality was not been reported for loss of igf <dig>  <cit>  or ins <dig>  <cit>  alone. although lethality could be due to a combination of loss of igf <dig> with excess cdkn1c, we have observed embryonic lethality associated with excess cdkn1c and normal igf <dig> levels on the 129/sv genetic background.

altered expression of igf <dig> in response to changes in the dosage of cdkn1c
our data showed that increasing expression levels of cdkn1c were associated with a decrease in the size of the embryo, starting prior to e <dig> . as the level of cdkn1c increased, we found a consistent decrease in the transcript level of the potent embryonic growth factor, igf <dig>  which was detectable as early as e <dig>  in our two-copy line. conversely, loss of expression of cdkn1c was associated with a reciprocal phenotype with the null embryos being 11% heavier than wild type embryos at e <dig>  with a three-fold increase in igf <dig> at e <dig> . complete loss of igf <dig> results in embryonic growth retardation from e <dig>   <cit> . similar to our 5d <dig> mice, igf <dig> heterozygotes are 10–20% smaller at birth and remain this small as adults  <cit> . although no significance size difference was reported at e <dig>  in the igf <dig> heterozygotes, genetic modifiers may provide an explanation for this discrepancy since our preliminary data suggest a weaker growth retardation phenotype in the c57bl/ <dig> background on which the igf <dig> studies have all been performed.

we also observed disturbances in the level of expression of a second key growth factor transcript, igf <dig>  however, this was only in the cdkn1c overexpressing mice and not in the cdkn1c null mice. also, we have some limited data from genetic crosses with mice over expressing igf <dig>  <cit>  that do not support a major role for this growth factor in our phenotype. it is therefore probable that reduced expression of igf <dig> was responsible for growth retardation in the presence of excess cdkn1c. this would also provide an explanation for why growth retardation was not restricted to the tissues in which there was excess cdkn1c since igf <dig> acts extrinsically to regulate growth. it will be possible to test this in genetic crosses when mice over expressing igf <dig> from an endogenous promoter become available.

there are a number of ways in which the cell cycle inhibitor, cdkn1c, could act on igf <dig>  although we cannot exclude a direct role for cdkn1c in regulating the expression of the igf <dig> gene, it seems more plausible that the cell cycle inhibitor acts indirectly, for example by reducing the proliferative potential of the cells in which igf <dig> is expressed or by altering the differentiation program of a particular cell type expressing the growth factor.

while it has been known for some time that imprinting acts directly to regulate embryonic growth via the epigenetic modification of key genes, our data suggests that imprinting can also act indirectly to regulate the levels of non-imprinted embryonic growth factors. this further highlights the complexity and the importance of genomic imprinting in mammalian growth and development.

imprinting of cdkn1c comes at a high cost
loss of expression of this gene is perinatal lethal in mice and linked to bws in humans  <cit> . we have shown that excess cdkn1c can be equally detrimental to development in mice and there is some evidence for this in humans  <cit> . given the increased frequency of intrauterine growth retardation in babies conceived after assisted reproductive technologies conceptions  <cit>  and a prevalence of imprinting mutations in these children  <cit> , excess cdkn1c may be an important factor in iugr in humans which should be explored further.

imprinting of cdkn1c may have played a role in the transition towards increased maternal investment in embryonic growth in placental mammals
the parental conflict hypothesis predicts that over expression of a gene expressed only from the maternal genome should limit embryonic growth. we have presented the first compelling evidence that overexpression of cdkn1c alone causes growth retardation and therefore the parental conflict hypothesis holds true for this gene. our work may also provide further clues to the evolutionary consequence of imprinting this important gene. imprinting has for some time been thought to have emerged prior to the divergence of marsupials from eutherians  <cit> . however, unlike igf <dig>  cdkn1c is not imprinted in marsupials  <cit> . therefore, the ic <dig> domain, containing the potent growth factor gene, igf <dig>  acquired an imprint prior to the divergence of marsupials and eutherians and the ic <dig> domain, containing cdkn1c, became imprinted after this divergence. it may be significant that one key difference between marsupials and eutherians is the size and maturity of the offspring at birth and this correlates with the role that we have identified for cdkn1c in regulating embryonic growth.

CONCLUSIONS
by using different copy number transgenes and mice carrying a targeted deletion of cdkn1c, we have shown that embryonic growth is exquisitely sensitive to the dosage of cdkn1c. since cdkn1c encodes the major regulator of embryonic growth within the ic <dig> imprinted domain, we propose that cdkn1c was the focal point of the selective pressure for imprinting of this domain. cdkn1c is a maternally expressed gene and our findings support the prediction of the parental conflict hypothesis that that the paternal genome will silence genes that have an inhibitory role in embryonic growth. furthermore, since cdkn1c acquired its imprinted status after marsupials diverged from placental mammals, our data would support a role for the change in dosage of cdkn1c gene in the relative increase size of the embryo in eutherians.
