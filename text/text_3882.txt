BACKGROUND
nonnegative matrix factorization  is a feature extraction method that has a property of intuitive part-based representation of the original feature  <cit> . due to the non-negativity constraint, the parts produced by nmf can be interpreted as subsets of elements that tend to occur together in sub-portion of the dataset  <cit> . in this way, nmf can be applied to the multidimensional dataset in order to discover patterns and to help interpretation of large biological dataset. this unique ability makes nmf a potentially promising method for biological sequence analysis.

proteins are said to have a common fold if they share a similar spatial arrangement of major secondary structures. proteins in the same fold may have low sequence similarity, but they often share similar functions. fold recognition is to detect a group of proteins that share the common fold with a query protein. it can provide valuable information about the functional role and structure of unknown proteins.

in general, there have been two common approaches for remote homolog detection. the first approach is solely based on sequence information, whereas the second approach uses structural information in addition to sequence information. hidden markov model  method  <cit> , psi-blast  <cit> , ffas  <cit> , picasso  <cit> , and compass  <cit>  can be classified into the first method. genthreader  <cit> , 3d-pssm  <cit> , fugue  <cit> , and prospect  <cit>  represent the second approach. currently most remote homolog detection methods are based on profile-profile alignment . some examples are sp <dig> method  <cit> , profnet  <cit> , coach  <cit> , and hmm-hmm comparison method   <cit> . although these methods are reliable for recognizing relatively close homologs related at the family level, there is still difficulty in finding related remote homologs, reaching only 25% sensitivity at 90% specificity at the superfamily level and very low sensitivity at the fold level.

recently, the introduction of support vector machine , a machine learning method, brings remarkable performance improvement in remote homolog searches. examples are svm-hmmstr  <cit> , svm-i-sites  <cit> , svm-pairwise  <cit> , svm-fisher  <cit> , and profile-profile alignment with svm  <cit> . more recently, several kernel methods such as local alignment kernels  <cit> , profile-based direct kernels  <cit>  and cluster kernels  <cit>  are developed to derive a more powerful remote homolog detection. among them, the method based on profile-profile alignment combined with svm  <cit>  detects 14% of remotely related proteins with 90% specificity at the fold level. even though previous svm-based methods have an ability to recognize the essential features from alignments of remotely related proteins, they do not provide the features with intuitive biological meaning. in addition, the dimension of the profile-profile alignment feature vectors for svm is quite high, considering the number of intrinsic feature vectors for fold recognition. in such cases, the effect, referred to as the curse of dimensionality, may occur and negatively influence the classification of a given data set.

the methods known as feature extraction techniques can be applied to reduce this problem. there are several linear feature extraction techniques, such as principal component analysis , independent component analysis , and multidimensional scaling , as well as nonlinear analysis such as isomap, lle, and self-organized feature maps. among them, nonnegative matrix factorization  is a linear technique that is characterized by its unique ability of intuitive part-based representation of the original feature  <cit> . in previous studies, nmf is applied to biclustering of gene expression data  <cit>  and discovering semantic features  <cit> . as an attempt to popularize the nmf method in the biological data analysis community, ls-nmf  <cit>  and bionmf  <cit>  are developed.

in this paper, we investigate the possibility of applying nmf to the profile-profile alignment features used for fold recognition and remote homolog detection. we expect that nmf would extract essential features from profile-profile alignment , improving the performance of fold recognition and identifying remote homolog relationship more accurately. the ppa features have two characteristics that are appropriate for utilizing nmf. first, not all ppa features are needed for recognition of each fold. instead, a small portion of the sequence is usually enough for each decision, while some portions coming from poor alignments or improper profiles may act as "noises." this suggests that nmf can improve the performance of svm by explicitly using part-based representation of essential features with lower dimensionality. secondly, the ppa score is essentially the sum of log odds scores, which can be decomposed linearly. the assumption of linear decomposition used in nmf fits well with this characteristic.

RESULTS
performance comparison for fold recognition at the fold level
in this section, we describe the fold recognition performance of svm with nmf features compared to that of ppa features, along with hhsearch and psi-blast results. in this work, we define the fold recognition problem in most rigorous way in that we only consider the situation where no proteins sharing the same superfamily members with a query protein are in the template library. to validate our method, we create training set  and testing set  using scop  <dig>  in such a way that the two sets do not share the same superfamily members.

in terms of roc <dig> scores, svm with nmf features detects homolog proteins at the fold level with  <dig>  mean roc <dig> score. in contrast the cases of original ppa feature, hhsearch, and psi-blst achieve only  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mean roc <dig> scores, respectively . furthermore, at roc <dig> score of >  <dig> , nmf features notably improve performance by which 22% of proteins well recognize homolog proteins while original ppa and hhsearch detect almost none. especially, from the high performance region of roc <dig> scores for fold recognition, we note that in the view of the performance of fold recognition, high performance region  is more improved than low performance region  by nmf features. nmf improves the performance by roughly fifty folds at roc score of >  <dig> . these results indicate that nmf removes "noises" that may have originated from poor alignments or improper features in the original ppa method, providing enhancement of fold recognition performance.

performance comparison at the superfamily level 
we also evaluate the performance of nmf features at the superfamily level using roc and roc <dig> scores. we construct new training and testing sets using scop  <dig> , where the testing set  and training set  do not share the same family members. figure  <dig> shows that the performance of nmf features is overall better than that of the original ppa features. with nmf features 59% of all proteins in testing set achieve roc scores of >  <dig> , whereas those of original ppa features, hhsearch, and psi-blast are 30%, 43%, and 11%, respectively. the mean roc scores of nmf feature, original ppa, hhsearch, and psi-blast are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. additionally, figure  <dig> indicates that the mean roc <dig> score of nmf feature  is significantly improved from those of original ppa features . at >  <dig>  roc <dig> scores, 52% of proteins with nmf features correctly detect remotely related proteins, whereas 28% and 39% for original ppa features and hhsearch, respectively. figure  <dig> shows roc <dig> score of nmf features versus that of original ppa features. nearly all points are to the right-hand side, indicating that nmf features effectively improve the performance of remote homolog detection. applying nmf degrades the performance for only 10% proteins in testing set but increases the performance for more than 70% proteins. noting that 25% of proteins with roc <dig> scores <  <dig>  in original ppa are significantly improved , we conclude that nmf recognizes essential features well even in the cases where original ppa features are not sufficiently good for detecting remote homologs.

benchmarking with lstm, la-kernel, and sw-pssm at the fold and superfamily level
recently, several kernel-based methods such as la-kernel  <cit>  and sw-pssm  <cit> , and a model-based method such as lstm  <cit>  have been developed. here, we compare our methods with those methods. however, there are some problems that make the direct comparison difficult. first, datasets are different; datasets for our method is based on scop  <dig> , while the other methods rely on scop  <dig>  to create datasets. fortunately, programs for la-kernel, lstm, and sw-pssm are available, and can be easily trained and tested on our datasets. however, there is another problem that the meaning of the score of our method is different from that of the other methods; kernel-based methods, and lstm give a score measuring that a certain protein may belong to a specific superfamily , while our method gives a score measuring that two proteins may belong to the same superfamily . therefore, to compare the methods, we need to create some sort of scheme that converts our scores to scores that have the same meaning with those of kernel-based methods. in fact, it is possible to develop a highly elaborated scheme, for example, a kernel-based method. however, in this work, we use the simplest scheme; we simply calculate the mean value of svm output scores of all templates in a specific superfamily . in addition, training and testing procedure is different. nonetheless, we measure the roc and roc <dig> scores for the present method, lstm, la-kernel, and sw-pssm .

lstm is a fast model-based protein homology detection method without alignment, and la-kernel is svm based method using string alignment kernel . the best performing method, sw-pssm is a profile-based local alignment kernel method . we measure the roc and roc <dig> scores for  <dig> folds at the fold level and  <dig> superfamilies at the superfamily level. for the lstm, we use default parameters and weight  and for the la-kernel we use version  <dig> . <dig> with β =  <dig>  . in case of sw-pssm, we use two parameter sets; default parameter set  and another parameter set  that was reported to be best-performing in the original paper. from table  <dig>  we note that the performance of svm output with nmf features is better than the two methods, lstm and la-kernel, while sw-pssm shows slightly better or comparable performance compared to the svm output with nmf features. it should be noted, however, that our method and the other methods are not directly comparable, and we have not tried to develop better scoring scheme because that is not the main objective of this study. furthermore, because our method produces more reliable similarity scores between the sequences than conventional pssm methods, it may be possible to develop a more accurate new kernel-based method using our svm output scores.

variation of performance improvement as a function of the number of positive training examples
we investigate roc <dig> score difference between svm outputs with nmf features and original ppa results. the figure  <dig> shows roc <dig> score improvement when nmf features are used, compared to original ppa features at the fold level. the x-axis indicates the number of positive training examples, and y-axis represents performance improvement of mean roc <dig> scores at the fold level. the figure indicates that nmf features recognize more homolog proteins than original ppa features in  <dig> folds among  <dig> folds. more importantly, the performance improvement is highly correlated with the number of positive training examples. the p-value of correlation slope is  <dig> , indicating that the correlation is very strong. this result is attributed to the nmf property of which nmf can extracts more accurate features when the data set is large. although at the small number of positive training examples fold level performance improvements look like a random distribution, in fact the correlation becomes stronger as the number of positive training examples increases. we conclude that nmf well recognizes essential features when the number of positive training examples increases.

performance variation with number of nmf basis vectors
in our experiment, a fixed value of  <dig> is used for the number of nmf basis vectors for each template. however, the number of basis vectors directly determines nmf features. to analyze the effect and find the optimal number of basis vectors, we assess performance variation as a function of the number of basis vectors. first, we divide the training set into two parts, where proteins in each set never share the same superfamily with another. we measure the performance variation of mean roc scores at the fold level with  <dig> different values for the number of basis vectors,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the results of mean roc scores are shown in figure  <dig>  when the number of basis vectors is  <dig>  the performance seems to be optimized with  <dig>  mean roc score. this experiment remarks that the number of nmf basis vectors significantly affects the performance. moreover, each fold has a different optimized number of basis vectors.

when we choose the value of  <dig> as the number of nmf basis vectors, this fixed value may cause a problem for the templates whose sequence lengths are less than  <dig>  some of nmf basis vectors in those cases can be either duplicated or become zero vectors, possibly leading to performance degradation or improvement for nmf cases. however, the ratio of those events occurring is only  <dig> %. thereby such small effect can be ignored. furthermore, from our experiments we discover that performance degradation occurs at the templates with a long sequence length rather than at those with a short sequence length. further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the number of nmf basis vectors and effective feature extraction.

nmf basis vectors overlap with functional sites and structurally conserved regions of proteins
main assumption of this work is that nmf can capture essential features of proteins. in this regard, nmf can reduce redundant regions in each protein, and its basis vectors provide useful information about proteins such as functional sites or structurally conserved regions. to verify our conjecture we conduct the statistical analysis on basis vectors by comparing them with functional sites of proteins and structurally conserved regions.

due to the part-based representation, nmf basis vectors consist of several blocks of nonzero scores. we compare blocks of nmf basis vectors with functional sites from prosite database  <cit>  and structurally conserved regions from multiple structural alignments. to validate nmf's ability to detect functional sites and structurally conserved regions, we make two types of random basis vectors. 'block random basis vector' is a vector in which nonzero blocks are randomly re-distributed along the vector, whereas 'point random basis vector' is a vector in which nonzero scores are randomly re-distributed. we also create 'ppa vectors', which are composed of the top 5% ppa scores.

first we evaluate the ability of nmf basis vectors to detect functionally important sites of each protein by comparing them with the functional sites of proteins from prosite. we use scanprosite, which allows us to scan protein sequences for patterns of functional sites stored in the prosite database  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the proportion of proteins as a function of the overlap ratio of nmf basis vectors with functional sites, along with those of ppa, block random basis vectors, and point random basis vectors. it is clear that nmf basis vectors detect a significantly larger number of functional sites than ppa vectors, block random basis vectors, or point random basis vectors. the average number of functional sites in  <dig> proteins is  <dig>  on average, nmf basis vectors detect  <dig>  functional sites, while ppa vectors, block random basis vectors, and point random basis vectors detect  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  functional sites, respectively. furthermore, the proportion of proteins from which more than 50% of functional sites are detected is 36%,  <dig> %, 10%, and  <dig> % for nmf basis vectors, ppa vectors, block random basis vectors, and point random basis vectors, respectively. these results remark that nmf is capable of extracting functionally important sites of proteins.

next, to verify nmf's ability to recognize evolutionary conserved regions from a structural perspective, we compare nmf basis vectors with the structurally conserved regions from multiple structural alignments. structurally conserved regions are important, as they maintain the structural features which define characteristics to a given fold. we use mustang_v. <dig>  <cit>  for multiple structural alignments, and structurally conserved regions are defined as over 95% conserved residues. figure  <dig> shows the proportion of proteins as a function of given structural coverage variation of nmf basis vectors, ppa vectors, block random basis vectors, and point random basis vectors. the average number of structurally conserved regions in  <dig> folds is  <dig> . on average, nmf basis vectors detect  <dig>  structurally conserved regions in  <dig> folds, whereas ppa vectors, block random basis vectors, and point random basis vectors detect  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  structurally conserved regions, respectively. furthermore, the proportion of proteins for which more than 50% of functional sites detected is 14%,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and virtually 0% for nmf, ppa, block random, and point random, respectively. this result verifies that nmf basis vectors effectively represent significant portions of structurally conserved regions.

from the two statistical analyses on functional sites and structurally conserved regions, we note that nmf basis vectors represent essential parts of sequences. svm's ability to recognize remote homologs depends on feature vectors. svms are trained well if feature vectors consist only of essential features for remote homologs detection. in this regard, nmf reconstructs original ppa feature vectors with noise reduction and preserves core regions such as functionally important sites and structurally conserved regions. therefore, nmf improves the performance of fold recognition.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we investigate the possibility of applying nmf to improve the profile-profile alignment features for fold recognition and remote homolog detection. we show that when nmf feature extraction method is used, the performance is greatly improved, compared to previous fold recognition algorithms. the main reason for the improvement is that nmf feature extraction method reduces "noises" and extracts essential features from ppas. due to this noise reduction property, svm with nmf features shows a great performance improvement for fold recognition at the fold level and the remote homolog detection at the superfamily level. we also find that improvement is bigger when data set is larger, and the number of basis vectors needs to be optimized for the best performance. as an evidence for nmf's ability to extract the essential features from sequences, we discover that there exists a close relationship between nmf basis vectors and functional sites or structurally conserved regions of proteins. this supports our conjecture that nmf basis vectors explicitly represent essential features of proteins.

feature extraction using nmf gives us intuitive understanding about the feature vectors. we can extract more useful feature vectors and analyze them to better understand the biological meaning of protein sequences, which makes nmf feature extraction method a promising tool not only for the fold recognition but also for the analysis of large-scale biological data. furthermore, as we point out in result section, our method produces more accurate similarity scores between the sequences than conventional pssm methods, which would allow us to develop more accurate kernel-based method based on our method.

for the future work we can use nmf to improve alignment quality. in fold recognition problem, improvement in sequence alignment accuracy remains a challenge, as existing methods still do not always reach the level of the best alignment possible  <cit> . accurate sequence alignments undoubtedly increase the performance of fold recognition. our results indicate that nmf methods can remove false alignments by allowing only a combination of essential features in profile-profile alignment. in this regards, we believe that nmf can be a promising method to improve sequence alignment accuracy. furthermore, by analyzing nmf basis vectors, we can extract intuitive information from protein sequences, which may be used for motif search.
