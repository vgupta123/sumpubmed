BACKGROUND
in any biological system, various genetic interactions occur concurrently amongst different genes. while some genes interact almost instantaneously, other genes could have time delayed interactions . from a biological perspective, instantaneous regulations represent the scenarios where the effect of a change in the expression level of a regulator gene is carried on to the regulated gene  instantaneously. in such cases, the effect is reflected almost immediately in the regulated gene’s expression levela. on the other hand, in cases where regulatory interactions are time-delayed, its effect will be seen on the regulated gene after a finite time delay.

bayesian network and its extension, dynamic bayesian network , has found significant applications in the modeling of genetic interactions  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, prior works on inter and intra-slice connections in the dynamic probabilistic network formalism  <cit>  have modelled a dbn using an initial network and a transition network employing the 1st-order markov assumption, where the initial network exists only during the initial period of time and subsequently the dynamics is expressed using only the transition network. realising that a d-th order dbn has variables replicated d times, a 1st-order dbn for this taskb is therefore usually limited to around  <dig> variables. alternately, if a 2nd-order dbn model is chosen, it can mostly deal with 6- <dig> variables  <cit> . thus, prior works on dbns were either unable to discover these two interactions simultaneously or were unable to fully exploit its potential, thereby restricting studies to simpler network configurations. however, since our proposed approach does not replicate variables, we can study any complex network configuration without limitations on the number of nodes. zou et al.  <cit> , while highlighting the existence of both instantaneous and time-delayed interactions among genes while considering the parent-child relationships of a particular order, did not account for the regulatory effects of other parents  on that particular child. this is in violation of the biological reality that parents with various orders of regulation can jointly regulate a child. our proposed method supports multiple parents to regulate a child simultaneously, with different orders of regulation. moreover, the limitation of detecting genetic interactions like a⇔b, which are prevalent in genetic networks  <cit> , is also overcome with the proposed method. experiments conducted using both synthetic and real-life grns show the effectiveness of our approach.

RESULTS
we evaluate our proposed method by studying both synthetic networks and real-life biological networks of saccharomyces cerevisiae , e. coli and cyanobacteria. the overall accuracy of the inference method and correctness of the modeling approach is evaluated by four widely accepted performance measures given below. the terms, tp, fp, tn and fn, used in the following expressions respectively mean the number of true positives, number of false positives, number of true negatives and number of false negatives. 

 <dig>  sensitivity: it measures the proportion of true connections which are correctly inferred. it is defined as follows: 

  se=tptp+fn 

 <dig>  specificity : specificity is defined by the following equation: 

  sp=tntn+fp 

 <dig>  precision : precision is proportional to the inferred connections which are correct. it is defined as follows: 

  pr=tptp+fp 

 <dig>  f-score : biologically, a good reconstruction algorithm should infer as many correct arcs as possible, in addition to the criteria that most of the inferred arcs should be correct. the f-score measure is the harmonic mean of se and pr <cit>  and represents a compromise between these two objectives: 

  f=2prsepr+se 

since our method uses discrete data for the statistical significance tests embedded in the scoring function, we applied the persist  <cit>  algorithm to discretize the data into  <dig> levels. the confidence level  is set to  <dig> . we will use a local search in the dag space with the classical operators of arc addition, arc deletion and arc reversal. the starting point of the search is always an empty graph. the parameters for all the other methods that are used for comparison are set to their default values mentioned in their user manuals.

synthetic network
synthetic network using differential equation based models
for performing studies using synthetic networks, we generated  <dig> random networks of size  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> using the genenetweaver tool  <cit> . this tool has been used to generate in silico benchmarks in the dream  challenge initiative. the tool is able to obtain biologically plausible network topologies  of a given size by extracting random sub-networks of saccharomyces cerevisiae and e. coli <cit> . we used the tool to generate time series data as in the dream <dig> challenge with ten different perturbations for each experiment. initial and final timestamps for the simulations were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and the time step was  <dig>  one of the objectives of this experiment was to test the usefulness of the proposed approach in the presence of noise in mrna expression levels. since microarray experiments can incur a wide range of noise levels depending on the technology, environment and the subject under study, we experimented under various noise levels that are likely to be present in the expression data. to mimic a real-life noisy environment, as in  <cit> , we added  <dig> different noise levels to the data samples . the performance, measured by the four performance measures, corresponding to the three different sized networks is reported in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the performance variation as a function of network size and noise level. the x-axes represent the noise levels while the y-axes represent the corresponding performance measures . in figure 2-, we compare our approach with three other methods, namely tdaracne, banjo and bnfinder  using the f-score . it is evident from the results that there is no clear winner in all the cases. some methods perform good in some cases, while others outperform it in other cases. however, it is clear that our proposed approach, albeit not always the best, it is always among the top performers and has consistently superior performance.

probabilistic network of yeast
we use a sub-network from the yeast cell cycle, shown in figure  <dig>  taken from husmeier et al.  <cit> . the network consists of  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions. for each interaction, we randomly assigned a regulation order of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  we used two different conditional probabilities for the interactions between the genes, namely, the noisy regulation according to a binomial distribution and the noisy xor-style co-regulation. for the binomial distribution dependent noisy regulation, the parameters were set as follows: excitation: p =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; inhibition: p =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . for the noisy xor-style co-regulation the parameters were set as: p = p =  <dig> , p = p =  <dig>   <cit> . eight confounder nodes were also added, resulting in the total number of nodes to be  <dig> 

we used  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples, generated  <dig> datasets in each case and compared our approach with two other dbn based methods, namely banjo  <cit>  and bnfinder  <cit> . since these methods detect only regulations of order  <dig>  while calculating performance measures for these methods, we ignored the exact orders for the time-delayed interactions in the target network. we could not apply tdaracne  <cit>  to this network since the generated data has two levels of discrete values and tdaracne returns error when applied to such discrete datasets. we show the results for this network in table  <dig>  where we observe that our method, coupled with a high precision, outperforms the other two in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. the f-score is also the best in all the cases. this points to the strength of our method in discovering complex interaction scenarios where multiple regulators may jointly regulate target genes with varying time-delays.

synthetic network of glucose homeostasis
in higher eukaryotes, glucose homeostasis is maintained via a complex system involving many organs and signaling mechanisms. the liver plays a crucial role in this system by storing glucose as glycogen when blood glucose levels are high, and releasing glucose into the bloodstream when blood glucose levels are low. to accomplish its task, the liver responds to circulating levels of hormones, mainly insulin, epinephrine, glucagon, and glucocorticoids  <cit> .

le et al.  <cit>  conducted an extensive review of the literature regarding the biological components affecting perinatal glucose metabolism. based on the study, a bayesian network model of glucose homeostasis containing  <dig> nodes and  <dig> interactions  was constructed. we used the model for generating datasets of varying size , having first and second-order regulations using the bayes net toolbox  <cit> . the random multinomial cpds used by this approach of data generation were obtained by sampling from a dirichlet distribution with hyper-parameters chosen by the methodc described in  <cit>  with a corresponding equivalent sample size  value of  <dig>  the choice of this prior distribution for the conditional parameters ensures a reasonable level of dependence between d-connected variables in the generative structure  <cit> .

we compare our method with the three other methods that were used previously for comparison, namely banjo  <cit>  and bnfinder  <cit> . while calculating performance measures for these methods, we ignored the exact orders for the time-delayed interactions in the target network. similar to the probabilistic network of yeast, we could not apply tdaracne for this network due to error occurring because tdaracne is unable to cope with the discrete data. the results are shown in table  <dig>  we observe that, both in terms of specificity and precision, our method outperforms others. the f-score is the highest in all the cases, indicating a good balance between sensitivity and precision.

real-life biological data of saccharomyces cerevisiae 
to validate our method with a real-life biological gene regulatory network, we investigate a recent network reported in  <cit> . in that significant work, the authors built a network, called irma, of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . they tested the transcription of network genes by culturing the cells in presence of galactose and glucose. the network is composed of five genes regulating each other; it is also negligibly affected by endogenous genes. it is one of the first attempts at building a reference data set having an accurately known target network  <cit> . there are two sets of gene profiles called switch on and switch off for this network, each containing  <dig> and  <dig> time series data points, respectively. a ’simplified’ network, ignoring some internal protein level interactions, is also reported in  <cit> . to compare our reconstruction method, we consider  <dig> other methods, namely, tdaracne  <cit> , banjo  <cit>  and bnfinder  <cit> .

irma on dataset
the performance comparison amongst various method based on the on dataset is shown in table  <dig>  we observe that our method clearly outperforms the others. there are no false predictions and precision is highest. the sensitivity and f-score measures are also very high.

irma off dataset
due to the lack of ’stimulus’, it is relatively difficult to reconstruct the exact network from the off dataset  <cit> . as a result, the overall performances of all the algorithms suffer to some extent. the comparison is shown in table  <dig>  again, we observe that our method reconstructs the gene network with high precision. specificity is also quite high, implying that the inference of false positives is low.

yeast kegg pathway reconstruction
in order to test the proposed method’s performance on yeast s. cerevisiae cell cycle, we selected a eleven gene network of the g1-phase: cln <dig>  cdc <dig>  mbp <dig>  swi <dig>  clb <dig>  cdc <dig>  sic <dig>  swi <dig>  cln <dig>  cln <dig>  clb <dig>  the data used was obtained from the cdc <dig> experiment of spellman et al.  <cit> . in the later stage of the g1-phase, the cln3-cdc <dig> protein kinase complex activates two transcription factors, mbf and sbf, and these promote the transcription of some genes important for budding and dna synthesis  <cit> . entry into the s-phase requires the activation of the protein kinase cdc28p through binding with clb <dig> or clb <dig>  and also the destruction of sic <dig>  <cit> . also, swi <dig> becomes associated with swi <dig> to form the scb complex that activates cln <dig> and cln <dig> in late g <dig>  mbp <dig> forms the mcb-binding factor complex with swi <dig>  which activates dna synthesis genes and s-phase cyclin genes clb <dig> and clb <dig> in late g <dig>  <cit> . in budding yeast, commitment to dna replication during the normal cell cycle requires degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor sic <dig>  the g <dig> cyclin-cdk complexes cln1-cdk <dig> and cln2-cdk <dig> initiate the process of sic <dig> removal by directly catalyzing sic <dig> phosphorylation at multiple sites  <cit> .

in figure 5-, we report network graphs reconstructed by our proposed approach, tdaracne, bnfinder and banjo. we also report the kegg pathway  <cit>  of the cell-cycle in yeast in  <dig>  since the ground truth for this network is not known, instead of applying performance measures as a means of determining network accuracy, we refer to the available correct interactions obtained from the kegg pathway  <cit>  and identify which of the predicted interactions are correct or otherwise. we observe from the results that our approach correctly identifies the regulation of swi4-swi <dig> and mbp1-swi <dig> complex by the cln3-cdc <dig> complex. also, the proposed approach infers that the swi4-swi <dig> complex regulates the cln1-cln2-cdc <dig> complex, which is correct. two more interactions inferred by our approach  are also correct based on the kegg pathway. overall we observe that none of the methods perform particularly well on this network. however, the number of correct predictions by our method  is higher than the other methods.

sos dna repair network of e. coli
we analyze the well-known sos dna repair network in e. coli as shown in figure  <dig>  this grn is well known for its responsibility of repairing the dna if it gets damaged. it is the largest, most complex, and best understood dna damage-inducible network to be characterized to date.

the expression of the genes in the sos regulatory network is controlled by a complex circuitry which involves the reca and lexa proteins  <cit> . normally lexa acts as the master repressor of more than  <dig> genes, including lexa and reca genes. this repression is done by its binding to the interaction sites in the promoter regions of these genes. when dna damage occurs, one of the sos proteins, reca, acts as a sensor. by binding to single-stranded dna, it becomes activated, senses the damage and mediates lexa autocleavage  <cit> . the drop in lexa levels in turn stops the repression of the sos genes and activates them. when the damage has been repaired, the level of activated reca drops and it stops mediating lexa autocleavage. lexa level in turn increases, starting repression of the sos genes, and the cell then returns to its normal state.

the expression data sets of the sos dna repair system were obtained from uri alon lab  <cit> . these data are expression kinetics of  <dig> genes namely uvrd, lexa, umud, reca, uvra, uvry, ruva and polb. four experiments were done for various uv light intensities . in each experiment, the above  <dig> genes were monitored at  <dig> instants which are evenly spaced by  <dig> minutes intervals.

the results corresponding to experiment  <dig> is presented in figure  <dig>  along with our result, we include the results from banjo, tdaracne and bnfinder in figure 6- and the target network in  <dig>  the results corresponding to the other experiments are available in additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  from the results, we observe that our method correctly identifies lexa and reca as the ’hub’ genes for this network. again, the exact ground truth for this network is not precisely known, and hence it is not possible to calculate the well-known performance measures. instead, using the known interactions obtained from literature  <cit> , an analysis of correct and incorrect predictions by our method is obtained and shown in table  <dig>  we observe that most of the interactions inferred by our proposed method are correct. it successfully infers lexa as the regulator of uvra, uvrd, umud and reca. also, considering the indirect regulation of reca through lexa, two more interactions, namely reca→uvry and reca→polb can also be considered correct. in contrast,  <dig> of the  <dig> identified interactions by tdaracne  <cit>  are correct. most of the interactions identified by banjo and bnfinder+mdl are incorrect. bnfinder+bde successfully identifies regulation of ruva, polb and uvra by lexa. in addition, the regulation of umud by reca can also be considered correct. however, compared to these methods, our proposed method infers the highest number of correct predictions. number of incorrect predictions is also very low for our method.

network analysis of strongly cycling genes in cyanobacteria, cyanothece sp. atcc 51142
to study our approach on a large scale network, we use a network of a strain of cyanobacteria, namely cyanothece sp. strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> . the microarray data corresponding to the genes were collected from two publicly available genome-wide microarray data sets of cyanothece, performed in alternating light-dark  cycles with samples collected every 4h over a 48h period: the first one starting with 1h into dark period followed by two dl cycles , and the second one starting with two hours into light period, followed by one ld and one continuous ll cycle   <cit> . in total, there were  <dig> samples. using a threshold filter with a 2-fold change cutoff,  <dig> genes were selected for the analysis. the genes are responsible for performing the major tasks of energy metabolism and respiration, nitrogen fixation, protein translation and folding, and photosynthesis, along with several other tasks. result obtained using our method is shown in figure  <dig>  the degree distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  to compare our result with the other methods, we applied banjo, bnfinder and tdaracne. the results of all the three except bnfinder was not satisfactory. as a result, we compare our method only with bnfinder+bde.

similar to other large scale datasets , the microarray data set for cyanobacteria also has very few samples. moreover, being not a well-studied organism, it requires caution in the interpretation of results. we note that grn reconstruction studies of cyanobacteria reported earlier  commonly emphasise an evaluation criteria, namely “functional enrichment” analysis of sub-networks. further, another common feature noted for genetic networks  <cit>  is that transcriptional regulatory networks possess the scale free nature of the network topologyd. since we have limited samples and also because the ground truth is unknown, we have carried out the evaluation of the inferred network using both:  statistical means i.e. go functional enrichment analysis , and  the r <dig> measure of the power-law fit of the network to establish its scale-free nature.

the enrichment analysis was done by using gene ontology  database , where every go terms appearing in each sub-network is assessed to find out whether a certain functional category is significantly over-represented in a certain sub-network/cluster, more than what would be expected by chance. the cytoscape  <cit>  plugin bingo  <cit>  was used for go functional category enrichment analysis. for bingo, we use the combined and filtered gene set as the reference set, the hypergeometric test as the test for functional over-representation, and false discovery rate  as the multiple hypothesis testing correction scheme.

first, we present the results corresponding to p =  <dig> . the network obtained by bnfinder+bde has  <dig> sub-networks each containing at least  <dig> genes. of these,  <dig> sub-networks have significantly enriched functionalities . of the other  <dig>  we compute the  <dig> most densely connected hubs for each sub-network, and in  <dig> of  <dig> such sub-networks, the hubs have defined significantly enriched functionalities. on the other hand, in our result, there are  <dig> sub-networks in total having at least  <dig> genes. of these,  <dig> sub-networks have defined enriched functions . of the other  <dig>  we compute the  <dig> most densely connected hubs for each sub-network, and in  <dig> of the  <dig> such sub-networks, the hubs have defined significantly enriched functionalities.

the results corresponding to p =  <dig>  show that for bnfinder+bde,  <dig> sub-networks have enriched functionalities . of the other  <dig>  we compute the  <dig> most densely connected hubs for each sub-network, and in  <dig> of the  <dig> such sub-networks, the hubs have defined enriched functionalities. on the contrary, the result using our approach has  <dig> sub-networks with defined significantly enriched functions . of the other  <dig>  we compute the  <dig> most densely connected hubs for each sub-network, and in  <dig> of the  <dig> such sub-networks, the hubs have defined significantly enriched functionalities.

we also test the networks to assess whether they are scale free, using a power law fit. the r <dig> value of the fit corresponding to our network is  <dig> , which is a better fit compared to bnfinder+bde .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we propose a framework that can simultaneously represent instantaneous and time-delayed genetic interactions. the proposed scoring metric uses information theoretic quantities having not only relevant properties but also implicitly includes the biological truth that some genes may jointly regulate other genes. incorporating these novel features, we have implemented a score+search based grn reconstruction algorithm. experiments have been performed on different synthetic networks of varying complexities and also on real-life biological networks. our method shows improved performance compared to other recent methods, both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and number of false predictions and at the same time maintaining comparable or better true predictions. a natural extension of the described method can be incorporation of a-priori knowledge from sources like protein-protein interactions databases and fusing the knowledge with existing regulatory networks to make the inferred networks much more reliable, and we are pursuing this objective. along with these extensions, the proposed approach would improve the accuracy of gene regulatory network reconstruction and enhance research in systems biology.
