BACKGROUND
dpscs are ascs and were first described in  <dig>  <cit> . dpscs share similar characteristics with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells   <cit> . dpscs have been differentiated into neuronal cells under the guidance of neurogenic factors  <cit> . additionally, dpscs may also be therapeutic by providing trophic support  <cit>  or recruiting endogenous cells for repair  <cit> .

most studies involving ascs are derived from healthy donors, and studies involving dpscs have, in general, been limited. due to the advantages of using one's own cells for therapy  <cit> , plus their potential use in the central nervous system   <cit> , we are interested in characterizing dpscs derived from individuals with hd and determined if hd-dpscs retain comparable stem cell properties to those derived from a healthy individual.

hd is a dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation resulting in the expansion of polyglutamine  repeats in exon  <dig> of the it <dig> gene encoding for htt. cag repeat lengths over  <dig> results in pathological hd. a negative correlation has been shown between repeat length and age of onset  <cit>  and lifespan  <cit> . the hallmark of hd is neurodegeneration, predominantly in the striatum and cortex  <cit> . many hd patients do suffer from tooth decay; however this decay is due to medication and lack of motor skills to perform teeth maintenance procedures  <cit> . here we have used transgenic hd monkeys  <cit>  as a model for investigating the effect of mutant htt on the properties of dpscs.

RESULTS
establishment of dpscs from hd monkeys
we have isolated and established dpscs from the teeth buds of three double-transgenic hd/g monkeys  and one transgenic gfp monkey . rhd <dig> and rhd <dig> died shortly after birth at full term. both rhd <dig> and rhd <dig> demonstrated hd phenotypes including severe dystonia and chorea  <cit> . rhd <dig> and rgfp were miscarried monkeys, born at four months of gestation. rhd/g-dpscs have distinctive morphology including long and spindle shaped  which were similar to published reports of rbmscs  <cit> , rhesus monkey dpscs   <cit> , chimpanzee dpscs   <cit> , hbmscs and hdpscs  <cit> . there were no overt differences in cellular characteristics of dpscs derived from different individuals. all cell lines expressed gfp  and were capable of self-renewal.

expression of stem cell specific transcription factors in rhd/g-dpscs
to further evaluate stem cell properties of rhd/g-dpscs with various degree of mutant htt, quantitative measurement of stemness factors  was performed by q-pcr. there was no different in the expression pattern of stemness factors between canine and molar derived dpscs. however, variations in expression levels were observed among individuals . rhd <dig> and rhd <dig> have lower expression compared to rhd <dig> and rgfp.

differentiation competence of rhd/gfp-dpscs
one of the defining characteristics of ascs is multipotent differentiation capability. all rhd/g-dpscs were capable of differentiating into osteogenic , adipogenic  and chondrogenic lineages , which are trademark events of ascs  <cit>  and dpscs  <cit> . the multipotent differentiation capability of rhd/g-dpscs and r/g-dpscs were similar to published reports of rhesus macaques  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  ascs. similar to previous studies, the fat droplets in dpscs were relatively smaller and less intense than that of bmscs  <cit> .

the effect of mutant htt on the differentiation capacity of hd-dpscs was further determined by quantitative measurement on the expression of lineage specific markers including osteopontin , lipoprotein lipase  and collagen ii  by q-pcr . there was no detectable expression of lipoprotein lipase and collagen ii prior to induction. on the other hand, osteopontin was expressed before induction and was increased in some of the dpsc lines after induction. variations among cell lines were also observed .

cell surface antigen profile
the expression profile of cell surface antigens is another method for determining the similarity between cell types and is often used to isolate ascs. a total of  <dig> cell surface antigens were examined and compared to published reports. rhd/g-dpscs were positive for cd29+, cd73+, cd90+, cd166+, cd59+, cd44+ and cd105+, all of which are bmsc markers . however, markers specific for hematopoietic cells, including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were not detected . rhd/g-dpscs were also negative for cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> . these results were comparable to the expression profiles of the rg-dpscs and other higher primates   <cit>

expression of mutant htt in rhd/g-dpscs
in order to determine the effect of mutant htt on the properties of rhd/g-dpscs, the expression of mutant htt and the formation of oligomeric htt were evaluated. expression of mutant htt was significantly increased in all hd-dpscs determined by q-pcr . among hd-dpsc lines, rhd <dig> had the highest expression of mutant htt, while rhd <dig> has the lowest . the formation of mutant htt aggregate was revealed by using western blotting analysis  and immunostaining  using mem <dig>  a monoclonal antibody that binds to human htt enhanced with a polyq expansion. nuclear inclusions and mutant htt aggregates were observed in all rhd/g-dpscs, but not in rg-dpscs . among the three hd monkeys, rhd <dig> had the most extensive intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic mutant htt aggregates compared to rhd <dig> and rdh <dig>  western blotting analysis further confirmed the presence of oligomeric htt at a high molecular weight  in the upper portion of a gradient polyacrylamide gel  in all hd-dpsc cell lines. again, rhd <dig> had a more intense band than rhd <dig> and rhd <dig>  suggesting the presence of more oligomeric htt. the observation of htt by immunostaining of rhd/g-dpscs was consistent with the expression level of mutant htt determined by q-pcr and the extent of oligomeric htt demonstrated by western blot analysis.

discussion
latest advancements in therapeutic applications of asc have driven our interest in evaluating a patient's own dpscs as an alternative source for cell therapy. although recent studies have demonstrated the differentiation potential of dpscs toward neuronal lineage  <cit> , in-depth characterization such as biofunctions in vivo will further determine the therapeutic potential of dpsc derived neural cells. while therapeutic applications of dpscs in cell replacement therapy are at preliminary stage, continued development in differentiation protocol and in vivo validation are important steps. unlike cell replacement, endogenous stem cells are expected to divide and differentiate under the influence of the dpsc graft and the microenvironment  <cit> .

in this study, hd-dpscs were derived from teeth buds of miscarried hd monkeys and hd monkeys that died soon after birth. while the biofunctions of hd-dpscs may vary from those derived from adult individuals, our findings suggested rhd/g-dpscs retain properties comparable to ascs  <cit> . additionally, the impact of age on the biofunctions of dpscs has not been fully addressed and it is important for determining future applications of dpscs derived from individuals at different ages. although we speculate the biofunctions of dpscs will not be impacted significantly by age, the derivation efficiency of dpscs may vary due to the number of stem cells existed in the dental pulps. while the present study is aimed to determine if dpscs with inherited genetic defect retain asc properties, our future goal is to determine if dpscs derived from living hd monkeys or patients can be used to derive neuronal cell types for replacement therapy. moreover, genetic correction of hd-dpscs may be considered prior cell transplantation because hd-dpscs may not have longevity and may not function in the same way as dpscs derived from normal animals.

multipotent differentiation capability was evaluated by in vitro differentiation into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. differentiation into these three lineages is considered one of the basic requirements for bmscs, which is widely applied in ascs  <cit> . all rhd/g-dpscs differentiated to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, which were comparable to rg-dpscs and published reports   <cit> . recent studies have suggested that dpscs are also capable of differentiating into neurons  <cit> . although the current paradigm of asc therapy is primarily based on the homing nature of ascs  <cit>  and their capability of eliciting a local repair response  <cit> , their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types including neurons may be therapeutically relevant. while all tested cell lines were capable of differentiating into three different lineages, quantitative studies on specific lineage markers suggested variations in differentiation capacity among dpsc cell lines exists. therefore, whether dpscs derived from hd monkeys or normal rhesus monkeys have more preferred lineages upon differentiation cannot be concluded.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that dpscs derived from hd monkeys retain asc properties, thus one may consider that these cells also retain biofunctions comparable to those derived from healthy individuals  <cit> . this study supports the potential future therapeutic application of dpscs from patients with genetic disorders such as hd. we demonstrated that dpscs from hd monkeys are comparable in all aspects that define ascs. thus dpscs derived from patients with inherited genetics diseases hold great promise as an alternative source for personal cell therapy.
