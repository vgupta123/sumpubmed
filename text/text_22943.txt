BACKGROUND
the design and implementation of simpler biological systems is relevant for biotechnological applications, and as a way to address basic biological questions. in principle, simplified versions of extant cells should be easier to understand and engineer towards a variety of tasks like production of biomolecules or exploitation of metabolic or physiological process. besides, the search for simpler cells through genome reduction might help to identify novel species-specific essential genes under a set of defined conditions. this in turn will lead to improvements in our understanding of the basic machinery of cells, and ultimately will shed light into the minimal and sufficient features required for life  <cit> .

genomes of free living bacteria often contain a plethora of genes necessary to face a changing and unpredictable environment. for instance, it was shown that among different strains of the marine picocyanobacteria synechococcus sp. only between  <dig> - 67% of the genes in each strain  were shared among all sequenced genomes  <cit> . a similar situation was shown for prochloroccocus marinus where only  <dig> - 67% of the genes  were shared by all sequenced strains  <cit> . while genes from the core genome  code for essential genes, the set of variable genes might be composed of a) genes necessary for living in particular micro-environments ; b) genes relatively neutral to cell fitness that might have arrived by hgt; and c) selfish genetic elements  <cit> . although some of these variable genes might be necessary to survive in nature, they probably are unnecessary under laboratory or other artificial conditions. they can even constitute barriers that obstruct human manipulation of the organism for biotechnological or other purposes. the concept of a tabula rasa genome  <cit>  implies that by eliminating the set of variable genes, a reduced  genome with the necessary functions to sustain a cell would be obtained.

identification of dispensable genes in genomes is often carried out through comparative analysis between strains . this approach was performed successfully for escherichia coli, where a reduced version of its genome with robust metabolic performance was engineered  <cit> . by comparative genomics, pósfai and co-workers  <cit>  identified segments of the chromosome of e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> that were absent in five other e. coli strains. these genomic islands , putatively code for non-essential genes. by focusing initially on large segments or gis coding for is-elements, they deleted approximately 15% of the genome of e. coli. surprisingly, the resulting e. coli strain, endowed with this reduced genome, showed a number of emergent properties, including more rapid growth rate, increased genome stability and high electroporation efficiency.

synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> is an obligate photoautotrophic fresh-water cyanobacteria described initially by von nägeli  <cit> . two strains from s. elongatus  have been sequenced to date  <cit> . with a genome of approximately  <dig>  mb and two plasmids  s. elongatus was the first cyanobacteria demonstrated to be transformable by exogenously added dna  <cit> . it is a model for the circadian clock in prokaryotes  <cit> . large scale inactivation experiments were performed to identify loci that are important for circadian rhythms of gene expression  <cit> . its biological properties, like autotrophy, transformability, relatively rapid growth rate and easiness of cultivation, make this organism an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications that require a photosynthetic organism. here we carry out a bioinformatic analysis of the s. elongatus genome and identify regions coding for putatively dispensable or essential genes. this work constitutes a first step towards the engineering of a reduced genome for a model autotrophic cyanobacteria.

RESULTS
phylogenomic analysis
to better evaluate the results from a comparative genome analysis, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree from available cyanobacterial genomes. reciprocal best blast hit searches were performed among  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes, revealing  <dig> protein families of putative orthologous genes. from them, we selected  <dig> families belonging to the set of conserved proteins identified by  <cit> . after aligning individual protein families and trimming for poorly aligned regions, we concatenated all sequences to get a final matrix of  <dig>  amino acid residues. a minimum-evolution tree was reconstructed from this matrix . the resulting tree is in general agreement with other phylogenomic trees  <cit>  and with 16s rrna trees  <cit> . the branching of synechococcus sp. wh <dig> within prochlorococcus clade has been observed in other phylogenomic analyses  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  while s. elongatus is the sister group of marine picocyanobacteria  it is not closely related to any other cyanobacterial lineage in the dataset.

detection of genomic islands
genomic comparison between different strains of a single species is the most direct approach to identify conserved and variable regions in genomes. this approach was successfully applied to identify deletable genes in escherichia coli  <cit> . however, as previously reported for s. elongatus  <cit> , genomic comparison of pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> strains revealed that this approach was not useful for these genomes due to lack of large genomic differences. the single major difference between both genomes was an inversion comprising ~ <dig>  kb located from nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> in pcc  <dig>  smaller differences corresponded to single nucleotide polymorphisms and two small deletions in pcc  <dig> relative to pcc  <dig>  also, differences in protein coding sequences among genomes reflected differences in annotations rather than differences at the level of dna . this low level of divergence was also evident from the short branches separating both strains in figure  <dig> 

to deal with the lack of available genomic diversity among sequenced synechococcus elongatus strains, we relied on a combination of methodologies to seek for horizontally transferred genes . in the first place, we looked at three features that could be indicative of a xenology, namely: a) genes having few  copies of a signature motif  in combination with an unusual codon usage; b) genes having an unusual phylogenetic relationship; and c) genes with an unusual g+c content. we classified as xenologs all genes sharing at least two of the previous characteristics. second, we also included as xenologs those genes sharing a predicted operon with previously identified xenologous genes if having one of three features mentioned above. third, we reviewed information on islandpath and islandviewer databases to compare the genes contained in these databases, known to be mobile, against our set of identified xenologs, to look for genes that might have passed undetected by our methods. fourth, we compared the genome of pcc  <dig> with metagenomic sequences from a microbialite to look for regions of no coverage that could suggest genomic islands. finally, the number and localization of orfans was also investigated. the results are detailed next.

unusual codon usage and signature motif hip1
a fortunate genomic peculiarity of pcc  <dig> helped us in the complex task of identifying xenologous genes. we used the scarcity of a highly iterated palindrome  designated hip <dig>  <cit>  in combination with unusual codon usage, as a signal of recent xenology. hip <dig> sequences are thought not to be mobile within the genome, but rather to form in situ through mutation  <cit> . hip <dig> sequences are clearly overrepresented in the genome of pcc  <dig> . the number of hip <dig> sequences among orfs in pcc  <dig> ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> and their distribution is apparently random . as expected for a random process, the number of copies of hip <dig> per gene is related to gene size , with some outstanding cases of orfs having too few copies of hip <dig> relative to their length.

it can be hypothesized that genes recently acquired by hgt  would lack the hip <dig> motif. by the same reasoning, genes residing for a long time in the genome would accumulate more hip <dig> copies than recent xenologous genes. however, the lack of hip <dig>  might be due to selection against hip <dig> for a number of obvious reasons, as indicated by the lack of hip <dig> copies in rdna and most of the ribosomal protein genes .

an initial set of orfs with relative few copies of hip <dig> motifs was identified as follows. we first formed groups of orfs according to their number of hip <dig> motifs . then, for all such groups with more than  <dig> orfs, we identified those orfs with a size larger than 1standard deviation  of the orf size distribution . hereafter all these orfs will be referred as hip1less. then, to discriminate between the two possibilities  among the hip1less set, we looked at codon usage. a bias in codon usage among genes in a genome is sometimes related to translation efficiency. this is especially true in species with large population sizes where natural selection can have a larger influence in fine tuning highly expressed genes to match trna abundance in the cell  <cit> . an algorithm to measure codon bias among different gene classes was introduced by  <cit> . for instance, in prokaryotic genomes, genes that deviate strongly in codon usage from the average gene but are sufficiently similar to codon usage from ribosomal protein genes  are predicted as highly expressed . on the other hand, genes that differ from standard classes of highly expressed genes, and to the codon usage of the average gene in the genome, are predicted as putative alien . we used the algorithm developed by  <cit>  as a criterion to discriminate between xenologs and highly expressed genes among those in the hip1less set. accordingly, we measured the average codon usage for all genes in the genome ) as a reference class of an average gene, and the average codon usage of ribosomal proteins ) as a standard class of highly expressed genes.

however, b where  is affected by orf size  making it difficult to compare the same measure ) among genes with different sizes. to correct for bias due to differences in orf sizes, we plotted b against the log, adjusted a ln equation to data, and then we measured the differences between b values ) to their respective predicted values ). the calculated differences between observed and predicted values  - ŷb) were then used as a measure of deviation of codon usage when compared to the codon usage of an average gene in the genome  - ŷb), or the codon usage of highly expressed genes  - ŷb) .

then, for all genes belonging to the hip1less set, we defined as pa genes, those having a positive difference larger than one standard deviation  in both measures. this indicates difference to both, highly expressed proteins on the one hand, and on the other hand, to the average gene in the genome. we defined as phx those having a positive difference larger than 1sd in b, and a negative difference smaller than -1sd in b, which indicates close similarity to codon usage of highly expressed ribosomal proteins. an extra category was introduced, namely  for proteins having a pattern similar to highly expressed genes. in summary, the three categories can be defined by the following relationships  - ŷb) and Δrp =  - ŷb)):

  pa= and ; 

  px= and or and ; 

  phx= and ; 

by using these criteria we identified  <dig> genes as putative alien ,  <dig> showing a codon usage similar to genes with high levels of expression , and  <dig> cases of putative highly expressed genes . a plot of b against b illustrates the differences among these gene sets , where red, blue and green colors stand for pa, px and phx respectively . clearly, those genes classified as highly expressed  participate in important functions in the cell .

*phx genes are shown in black, px otherwise.

unusual phylogenetic relationship
another method to detect xenologous genes seeks for sequences having unexpected phylogenetic relationships. we carried out blast searches of all proteins coded in pcc  <dig> against the genbank non-redundant  database. then, we recorded whether or not the blast best-hit belonged to cyanobacteria. we also downloaded all best matches up to  <dig> sequences and, for all set of homologous proteins having at least four members, we reconstructed neighbor-joining trees with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. for all cases where it was possible to identify a unique nearest neighbor to the sequence from pcc  <dig>  with a bootstrap value over  <dig>  we recorded whether it belonged to a cyanobacterial species.

conflicting data from blast best-hit and neighbor-joining trees was treated as follows. as it is known that the blast best-hit is often not the nearest neighbor  <cit> , we identified first all sequences having a nearest neighbor outside cyanobacteria according to neighbor-joining trees. then, for those sequences for which it was not possible to use the phylogenetic criteria , we used the blast best-hit criteria to decide whether the query sequence was more similar to proteins belonging to non cyanobacterial species.

blast comparisons against ncbi nr database allowed us also to identify those proteins in pcc  <dig> without homologs, the so called orfans. although it is possible that a proportion of orfans were false gene predictions, the possibility that many were real genes acquired by hgt from bacteriophages could not be ruled out  <cit> . by manually inspecting the list of orfans, we removed eleven proteins that failed to hit homologs above specified threshold due to its small size. among them, there were two very small proteins from the cytochrome complex  and one from the photosynthetic reaction center . we have also identified two genes coding for proteins from phages .

as expected, the vast majority of proteins in pcc  <dig> were more similar to sequences from other cyanobacteria . nevertheless, we identified  <dig> proteins more similar to sequences from species other than cyanobacteria, plus  <dig> orfans . some of the hits to non-cyanobacterial species were to photosynthetic protists. most of the similarities to non cyanobacterial species were to the phylum proteobacteria .

it should be kept in mind that having a nearest neighbor  to a non-cyanobacterial species, does not necessarily mean that the gene in pcc  <dig> was from hgt origin, because the opposite can also be true: that the gene in the non-cyanobacterial species originated by hgt from a cyanobacteria. therefore, additional criteria should be taken into account to decide between the two possibilities.

g+c content
although g+c deviation by itself is not a precise indicator of xenology, it can be useful in identifying recently acquired genes if it is used in combination with the other lines of evidence. in pcc  <dig> there are  <dig> and  <dig> genes with a g+c content above, and below 1sd from the average, respectively .

identification of xenologous genes by the combination of multiple approaches
no single method is expected to identify all cases of hgt. for instance, composition based methods are biased towards the detection of relatively recent cases of htg  <cit> . on the other hand, phylogenetic based methods detect ancient hgt events  <cit> . when looking for islands of variability in a genome where there are no genomes from different strains to compare, the best approach is to use a combination of methods, in order to avoid as much as possible the detection of false positives  <cit> . we compared the set of genes having an unusual g+c content, with those identified as pa , and those having a nearest neighbor or best blast hit outside cyanobacteria. those genes identified at least by two of the three methods were assumed to be xenologs. as shown in figure  <dig>  we detected  <dig> such cases. we have repeated the analysis with different sd cutoff values for the identification of pa, px and phx genes, and for the identification of genes deviating in g+c content. to evaluate the performance of these different cutoffs we used as a control set  <dig> genes that have not been subject to hgt among cyanobacteria  <cit> . the usage of 1sd for both cutoffs seems to be the best compromise between xenolog detection and avoidance of likely false positives .

genomic island databases
we also surveyed information on gis provided by islandpath  <cit>  and islandviewer  <cit>  databases. islandpath provides information on i) g+c content; ii) regions of dinucleotide bias; iii) presence of known mobility genes like integrases and transposases; and iv) localization of trnas . by looking at this information, we identified the following eight new xenologs: a) a phage integrase ; b) a small genetic island consisting of a phage integrase-like  followed by eight genes  and flanked by two trna-cys; and c) a transposase  not previously detected by our method.

islandviewer database uses a combination of methods to detect gis  <cit> . however, due to the lack of genetic diversity among s. elongatus sequenced genomes, the only useful method was sigi-hmm  <cit> . this method uses a hidden markov model  on measures of codon usage to identify possible gis. two islands, comprising  <dig> genes, were detected by this method, one located between nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  and the other from  <dig> to  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes included on these islands, only  <dig> were previously undetected by our method, these are two genes coding for pila-like proteins , two hypothetical proteins , and two xre family transcriptional regulators .

operon structure of xenologous genes
we looked at the predicted operon structure of those genes classified as xenologs to see if other genes within the same predicted operon had one of the characteristics previously used to identify cases of hgt . orfans and genes from phages were also considered. if this was indeed the case, these genes were classified also as xenologs. by this method, we identified  <dig> predicted operons in which all the genes in the operon , had at least one of the characteristics used to identify xenology . the exceptions were seven predicted operons in which the accompanying genes did not show any of the characteristics mentioned above. these seven cases could be attributed to errors in the operon prediction algorithm, false positives in the method used here to detect xenologs, or to truly chimerical operons .

comparison against metagenomic sequences from a fresh-water microbialite
islands of variability in genomes are also detected by comparison to metagenomic sequences  <cit> . the rationale is simple; regions of variability in the genome of interest will be underrepresented, while core genome regions will be more represented in metagenomic sequences. the presence of cyanobacteria from the order of chroococcales was reported in two metagenomes from fresh-water microbialites  in the desert of cuatro cienegas, méxico  <cit> . in particular, sequences from chroococcales in the metagenome of río mesquitez were the second most represented group with almost 20% of the classified sequences.

although the percentage of the genome of pcc  <dig> that is covered by metagenomic sequences from río mesquitez and pozas azules was low , there was a large gap in coverage between approximately nucleotides  <dig>  and  <dig>   suggesting the presence of an island of variability in this region. this gi coincides with one of the regions reported with sigi-hmm algorithm , with the largest region of contiguous genes having a dinucleotide bias according to islandpath database , and with the largest contiguous region of likely xenologous genes detected here. interestingly, high coverage regions corresponded to genes predicted to be highly expressed.

detection of conserved genes
highly conserved genes comprise the other side of the coin when looking for deletable regions in a genome. phylogenetic distribution of homologous sequences across genomes often follows a continuum, from genes present in just a single genome, to highly conserved genes present in a wide variety of lineages. this distribution has been described as consisting of three main clusters, namely, a small core of highly conserved genes, a larger shell of moderately conserved genes, and a much larger cloud of genes conserved among few lineages  <cit> . highly conserved genes tend to be part of the so called core genome or paleome , and genes with narrower phylogenetic distribution tend to be part of the cenome   <cit> .

to identify the paleome genes in pcc  <dig> we considered the following lines of evidence, a) genes in pcc  <dig> belonging to the cyanobacterial genome core cyog database  <cit> ; b) genes with homologs in at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> completely sequenced cyanobacterial genomes ; and c) genes with reciprocal best hits to the genome of the chromatophore of paulinella chromatophora  <cit>  and to the genome of prochlorococcus marinus ss <dig>  <cit> .

by using these four datasets we can classify genes from the core genome in different categories. for instance, genes belonging to cyog database and genes conserved in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes studied here, very likely are essential for any cyanobacterium. however, due to the evolutionary distance among sequenced cyanobacteria, the set of genes in cyog and conserved among the genomes studied here, is a minimal and certainly not enough to maintain a cell by themselves. complementary to this, p. marinus ss <dig> has been proposed as a model for a minimum free-living photoautotrophic cell because it has one of the smallest genomes among cyanobacteria  <cit> . the comparison against this genome is informative about how far away is s. elongatus from a real free-living photoautotrophic bacteria with a reduced genome. the chromatophore of p. chromatophora has a very small genome with only ~ <dig> protein coding genes and is phylogenetically related to p. marinus ss <dig>  although not a free living entity, genes retained in the chromathophore are likely to be important for the photoautotrophic life style  <cit> . the comparison against the chromatophore is indicative of the genes necessary to maintain a real non-free living photosynthetic cell.

the number of genes in pcc  <dig> belonging to the cyog set, as well as those identified by best blast hits with the two models of minimal photoautotrophic genomes, are shown in figure 10a. when looking at the intersection of these data, it turned out that most  were shared between the three datasets . in addition, there were  <dig> genes shared by at least  <dig> out of  <dig> genomes analyzed that were not present in any of the three previous comparisons. by pooling all four sets together, we defined the paleome as comprising  <dig>  conserved genes. this correspond to ~54% of all protein coding genes in pcc  <dig> . it is interesting to note that the set of genes belonging to the paleome coincides with the number of genes of free-living prokaryotes with the smallest genomes . on the other hand, the set of genes likely to be xenologs correspond to ~12% of protein coding genes in the genome. as expected, xenologs and orfans have the largest proportion of genes annotated as hypothetical proteins, while the paleome has the smallest one .

signal transduction systems
according to cog database,  <dig> genes from pcc  <dig> are classified in one or another functional category. of them,  <dig> are assigned to only one functional category. on figure  <dig> we show the cog classification of these genes and whether they are likely xenologs, belong to the paleome, or neither of them. as shown, categories having more xenologs  are 'signal transduction mechanism' and 'cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis'.

among genes belonging to 'signal transductions mechanisms' category, it was particularly notable that, out of  <dig> genes having a diguanylate cyclase domain,  <dig> were predicted to be xenologs . as suggested by domains present in these proteins, they might participate in two component signal transduction systems. for instance ggdef and eal domains are involved in the turnover of cyclic-di-gmp in vivo  <cit> . on the other hand, pas domains were found to act as sensors for light and oxygen in signal transduction systems  <cit> . signal receiver domains  <cit>  and gaf domains involved in regulation of cgmp  <cit>  as well as the integral membrane sensory domain mase <dig>  <cit>  were also found. these data suggest that pcc  <dig> could have acquired many environmental sensing capabilities through hgt.

horizontally transferred genes from central metabolism
we have found a series of horizontally transferred genes that participate in important metabolic roles within the cell. these include genes from oxidative phosphorylation, chlorophyll metabolism and starch and sucrose metabolism, among others . some of the transfers are clearly from non cyanobacterial species to s. elongatus, like in the case of perosamine synthetase. in other cases, the transfer seems to be among different species of cyanobacteria, like in the case of genes participating in oxidative phosphorylation where s. elongatus genes branches with genes from cyanothece sp. . in any case, it is noteworthy that genes that participate in central functions in s. elongatus arrived by horizontal gene transfer. clearly, these genes are not candidates to be deleted from the genome.

false positives
 <dig> genes were classified both as xenologs as well as belonging to the core set of genes, by the criteria used in this work. to decide whether these were true xenologs or false positives, we carried out a more thoughtful phylogenetic analysis. we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using the first one hundred hits from blast against genbank non redundant database, and we inspected the results visually. xenology was still supported in ten cases, and seven of them seemed to be false positives .

* criteria to detect coregenes. for each gene, it is shown if it is conserved in 1) chromatophore of p. chromathophora; 2) p. marinus ss 120; 3) cyogs database; and 4) number of cyanobacterial genomes with homologous genes. ¥criteria to detect xenologs. a) g+c content in number of sd from the mean; b) unusual phylogenetic relationship by blast or neighbor-joining; and c) putative alien  genes.

CONCLUSIONS
blueprint for a reduced photoautotrophic cell
we present an analysis of conserved and variable regions in the genome of the cyanobacteria synechococcus elongatus, strain pcc  <dig>  in figure  <dig> we show the localization of these regions along the genome. the complete list of conserved and variable genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  our results can be instrumental to test the essentiality/dispensability of genes in pcc  <dig> by experimental approaches in the pursuit of a streamlined photoautotrophic platform.

conserved genes were detected by combining the results of four analysis:  by looking at homologous in a dataset of  <dig> complete cyanobacterial genomes, and asking for at least 75% alignment coverage of the query sequence;  by looking for conserved proteins by reciprocal best blast hit with the reduced genomes of p. marinus ss <dig>  and the chromatophore of p. chromatophora; and  by identification of proteins of pcc  <dig> belonging to the set of conserved cyogs  <cit> . as expected, a large fraction of genes  overlapped in the four datasets. these genes are likely to be essential under a broad spectrum of environmental conditions.

on the other hand, variable regions were detected by a combination of methods that in isolation might not offer strong evidence of xenology, but when combined, we believe them to have high predictive power to identify cases of hgt. our analysis exemplifies how to detect gi in a phylogenetically isolated bacterial genome. in particular, the existence of hip <dig> motifs facilitated the identification of recently acquired genes. nevertheless, some bias  in detection of xenologs was expected because the identification of genes with unusual phylogenetic relationships was designed to search for genes not belonging to cyanobacteria.

by eliminating dispensable genes, a simpler and smaller genome might be engineered that could be used as a chassis for diverse biotechnological applications. although there is no guarantee that all genes in gi will be deletable without detrimental effects, by looking at their annotated functions it is possible to have a clue of their role in the cell. the elimination of genes that might destabilize the genome by introducing undesired mutations, like integrases and transposases, is one of the first obvious steps in this direction. then, deletion experiments should be directed towards large gis. if some of the proposed deletions have an effect on fitness, it would be necessary to allow for compensatory evolution to restore the system to a new equilibrium before experimentally attempting new deletions  <cit> . it also has to be noted that not all genes arrived by hgt are candidates to be deleted from the genome, as exemplified by most of the genes in table  <dig>  the approach presented here can be further complemented by mechanistic models of subsystems of the cell  to indicate new avenues to engineer simpler biological systems.
