BACKGROUND
the long-term health consequences of cigarette smoking have been well documented  <cit> . for example, cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and cardiovascular diseases , and smokers experience higher rates of mortality relative to non-smokers for these disease states  <cit> . cigarette smoking is known to exert local  and systemic effects, and hence adversely impacts multiple organ systems. smoking-induced oxidative stress and inflammation are hypothesized as key mechanisms that drive smoking induced diseases  <cit> . smoking has been known to alter key signaling pathways and suppress immune responses, among other physiological processes  <cit> . at cellular and molecular levels, chronic smoking induces a wide range of macromolecular and biochemical changes. for example, several investigators have identified differentially expressed genes in several organ/tissue systems, including lung  <cit> , nasal epithelia  <cit> , buccal cells  <cit>  and peripheral blood mononcuclear cells   in smokers. genes affected by cigarette smoke include those involved in cell survival, inflammation, tumor suppression, and apoptosis and are implicated in smoking-related diseases  <cit> .

smokeless tobacco products  are a diverse category of tobacco products that are consumed worldwide. consumption of stps may be associated with an increased risk for oral and other cancers as well as increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart diseases, depending on the type of product usage  <cit> . fermented moist snuff, or dipping tobacco, is the widely consumed oral stp in the us  <cit> . existing us epidemiological data suggests moist snuff consumption is generally associated with reduced health risks, relative to smoking, although risk for certain cvd mortality is elevated compared to non-consumers of tobacco  <cit> .

findings from epidemiological studies among cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users in the us indicate that relative to never tobacco use, smokeless tobacco use has been associated with less mortality than cigarette smoking. in particular, data from the american cancer society’s cancer prevention study ii  indicate, among male smokeless tobacco users compared with male never users of tobacco, the adjusted risks of mortality  were  <dig>   for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;  <dig>   for lung cancer;  <dig>   for coronary heart disease; and  <dig>   for oropharynx cancer  <cit> . in contrast, data from the cps-ii indicate, among male cigarette smokers compared with male never users of tobacco, the adjusted risks of mortality  were  <dig>   for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;  <dig>   for lung cancer; and  <dig>   for coronary heart disease  <cit> . the relative risk of mortality from oropharynx cancer in this cohort of male cigarette smokers was estimated to be  <dig>    <cit> .

given the overall burden of disease and mortality due to the consumption of tobacco products, particularly cigarette smoking, harm reduction efforts have led to the recognition of a continuum of risk among different tobacco product categories. whereas combustible tobacco products such as cigarettes are identified as the most harmful, non-combustible tobacco products are associated with substantially lower harm, relative to the non-consumption of any tobacco as the baseline risk in us . additionally, the available epidemiological data from sweden among snus  supports the reduced risk and harm of non-combustible tobacco relative to cigarettes  <cit> . briefly, snus is manufactured from ground air- or sun-cured tobacco and other ingredients using a heat-treatment process that differs from the process of manufacturing of us-style moist snuff  <cit> .

while the harmful effects of cigarette smoking have been extensively investigated and are better understood, the effects of stps, including moist snuff remain incompletely understood. previous work from rai companies evaluated the long-term effects of consumption of moist snuff and cigarette smoking and evaluated several biomarkers of exposure  and biomarkers of effect  in cross-sectional studies. in the first study, in addition to several bioexp, some biomarkers related to cvd were evaluated . a second study, termed biomarker discovery study, focused on bioexp and bioeff in a different study cohort  <cit> . although the moist snuff consumer cohort  in both studies exhibited higher levels of nicotine biomarkers and tobacco specific nitrosamine biomarkers  compared to the smoker cohort , combustion-related biomarkers in the msc were comparable to that found in the non-tobacco consumer cohort  in both studies referenced above. select bioeff, including those associated with arachidonic acid metabolism, were elevated in both studies in smk relative to msc and ntc  <cit> . further, global metabolomic evaluation of plasma, saliva and urine collected in the biomarker discovery revealed that smk exhibit distinct metabolite profiles compared to msc and ntc cohorts  <cit> . overall, bioeff indicative of vitamins c and e, and purine metabolism were altered in smk, possibly due to increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in that cohort, relative to the msc and ntc  <cit> .

in our continuing efforts to further characterize the physiological changes in long-term smokers and moist snuff consumers, and to identify potential bioeff we have investigated global gene expression changes in the tobacco consumers in the biomarker discovery study cohorts . additionally, these studies offer an opportunity to evaluate the concept of risk continuum among tobacco products at a molecular level. pbmcs collected from the study subjects in the biomarker study were utilized in this global gene expression profiling study.

methods
study design and population
the study design and the cohort characteristics have been previously described  <cit> . briefly, this was a single-blind, cross-sectional study of healthy volunteers conducted at the high point clinical trials center, high point, nc, usa. the inclusion criteria for cigarette smoker  group were: males aged 35– <dig> years; exclusive cigarette smoker of any brand with ≥6 mg “tar”/cigarette by cambridge filter method1; consumption of ≥ <dig> cigarettes/day for ≥3 years according to self-report; and expired carbon monoxide  level 10–100 ppm. the inclusion criteria for moist snuff consumer  group were: exclusive moist snuff consumer of any brand; consumption of ≥ <dig> cans moist snuff per week for ≥3 years according to self-report; and eco level 0–5 ppm. the inclusion criteria for non-smoker  group were: individuals reporting non-use of any tobacco or nicotine-containing products for ≥5 years with an eco level of 0–5 ppm. subjects provided written informed consent upon enrollment. the study conformed to ich good clinical practice guidelines and was conducted according to the principles of the declaration of helsinki. the study was approved by a central institutional review board , and registered at clinicaltrials.gov . additional details on the subject demographics are summarized in additional file 1: supplementary methods.

blood sampling, pbmc preparation, and cell type analysis
blood samples were collected from each subject on the morning of day  <dig>  under fasting conditions and before tobacco consumption. blood was processed within 2 h of blood collection. peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated from whole blood as described previously  <cit> . blood samples were mixed with isolymph  and incubated for 45 min, and the leukocyte layer was removed and centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 10 min at room temperature. after removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in pbs at a ratio of pbs:volume of top layer leukocytes drawn of 2:5 ml. five ml of cell suspension was layered onto 3 ml of isolymph in 15 ml conical tubes and centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 45 min at room temperature. pbmc were collected from the middle layer and washed with running buffer  at  <dig> x g for 10 min at 4 °c. the isolated cell pellets were dissolved in rlt plus lysis buffer  with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min on ice before freezing for storage.

after isolating pbmcs from blood by density gradient centrifugation, pbmcs were labeled with different antibodies to measure the distribution of different subsets. isolated pbmcs  were labeled individually with cd2-fitc , cd14-fitc , cd20-pe  and cd56-pe  for differentiating t cells, monocytes, b cells and nk cells, respectively. after labeling the pbmcs, flow cytometry was performed with bd facscalibur  and by enumerating  <dig>  events  per sample. flow cytometer data was analyzed by using  <dig> . <dig> version of flow jo software . the tukey–krammer honest significant difference test  was used to compare the mean values of the pbmc subtypes among cohorts.

microarray experiments
the rna was prepared from pbmc lysates by seqwright dna technology services . using standard procedures, total rna was isolated using the qiagen rneasy plus mini kit , rna concentrations were determined using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer , and rna quality was determined by agilent bioanalyzer .

gene expression profiling was performed using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarray . the expression of ~ <dig>  transcripts were analyzed by using 100 ng of rna sample for double-stranded cdna synthesis, in vitro transcription of crna with biotin labelling and hybridization of crna on the microarray. the assay was performed using the affymetrix standard protocol genechip® 3’ ivt express kit user manual  and the genechip® expression analysis technical manual with specific protocols for using the genechip hybridization, wash, and stain kit .

microarray analysis
microarray data analyses were performed using either partek’s genomics suite software  or the bioconductor package in r  <cit> . prior to analysis, the partek batch remover method was used to remove batch effects caused by variability in reagents, arrays and equipment. all data were normalized using the robust multi-array analysis  method. statistical analysis was performed using pair-wise analysis of variance  and correcting for type-i error using the false discovery rate  adjustment method  <cit> . a minimum fold change of greater than  <dig>  for up-regulation and less than − <dig>  for down-regulation was established as the criteria for differential expression. an fdr adjusted p-value of < <dig>  was considered statistically significant. hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses  were performed using the subset of degs identified by pairwise analyses to examine similarities between subjects based on their gene expression profiles. hierarchical clustering was performed using ward’s minimum variance method, which aims to find compact spherical clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance using an optimal value of an objective function .

random forest classification models were built using ‘randomforest’ library in r. for each pair of groups , the data were randomly divided into equal number of training and test subjects. the random forest was built using the training group and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model was determined using the test group. we repeated this process  <dig> times and calculated the average classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the  <dig> runs. the average gini importance measure for the  <dig> runs is reported to indicate the influence of each gene in correctly classifying samples in their appropriate groups. higher gini values indicate the relative strength of a particular gene in classifying the samples.

thomson reuters  performed pathway analysis on the set genes whose expression levels were significantly affected between smk group and either msc or ntc group. this analysis utilized data from the genego global network, which contains information on ~ <dig>  proteins,  <dig> compounds, and more than one million interactions. an enrichment analysis was performed, which evaluated the overlap between the differentially-expressed genes and gene groupings from canonical pathway maps , process networks , toxic pathologies, and disease biomarkers.

quantitative polymerase chain reaction
to confirm the results obtained by affymetrix microarray, a taqman-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction  assay was performed on all  <dig> subjects in the study. target genes  were selected based on the microarray results as well a selected number of genes  which are known to be associated with smoking in the literature. a complete list of genes and rt-pcr probes are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

the qpcr analysis was performed by seqwright dna technology services . approximately 120 ng  or 40 ng  total rna was digested with dnase i before cdna synthesis in 10 μl reaction volume using superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit . ten microliters of cdna reaction mixture from each sample was mixed with 190 μl of nuclease-free water and 200 μl of  <dig> x gene expression master mix , and 100 μl of this mix was loaded into a 384-well the low density array  plate. each sample was loaded into the plate four times. the applied biosystems 7900ht fast system with software sds  <dig>   was used for the qpcr, using the following cycling conditions: stage  <dig>  50 °c for 2 min; stage  <dig>   <dig>  °c for 10 min; stage  <dig>  97 °c for 30 s,  <dig>  °c for 1 min .

the results of the qpcr analysis were reported as threshold cycle  values, defined as the fractional cycle number at which the labeled probe emits fluorescence above a fixed threshold. to give a relative ratio of the abundance of the target gene in each sample, the ct of the target genes were normalized to the ct of a reference gene  using the sds  <dig> , rq manager  <dig> . <dig> and dataassist v <dig> . <dig> software packages . statistical significance was determined by paire-wise anova and the p-values were adjusted using benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate to correct type-i error .

RESULTS
study population
the characteristics of the patient population have been previously reported  <cit> . a total of  <dig> generally healthy subjects completed the study, with  <dig> subjects in each group . the majority of patients were caucasian, with a mean age ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  years. the mean years of product use were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the smk and msc groups, respectively. during the month prior to the study, the mean number of cigarettes per day consumed by the smk group was  <dig> , while the msc group consumed a mean  <dig>  cans per week of moist snuff.

pbmc populations in tobacco consumers
in an effort to understand how consumption of combustible and non-combustible tobacco products impacts gene expression in pbmcs, we first examined if there were differences in pbmc levels between the three study groups. total pbmcs were significantly  higher in smk, relative to msc and ntc cohorts . the percentage of cd2+ cells  in the isolated pbmcs was also significantly higher in smk, relative to msc and ntc cohorts. the number of pbmcs or the cd2+ cells did not differ significantly between msc and ntc. in contrast, the average number of cd56+ cells  was significantly different across all three groups, with ntc group showing the highest followed by msc and then smk groups. no differences in monocytes and b lymphocyte populations were detected across the three groups . these results suggest that smokers and moist snuff consumers exhibit differences in specific leukocyte subpopulations compared to non-tobacco consumers.fig.  <dig> yield of pbmcs and % positive cd <dig> and cd <dig> cells from smk, msc and ntc. yield of total pbmcs from smk, msc and ntc cohorts  are shown on the top panel. % cd <dig> positive cells from smk, msc and ntc cohorts are shown in the middle panel. % cd <dig> positive cells from smk, msc and ntc cohorts are shown in the bottom panel. the tukey–krammer honest significant difference test  was used to compare the mean values among cohorts




gene expression profiling
pbmc gene expression levels for  <dig> subjects were examined using the affymetrix hg u <dig> plus  <dig> array, which contains probes for over  <dig>  human transcripts. pair-wise statistical analyses were performed between smk, msc and ntc groups. surprisingly, we found no significant  differences in gene expression levels between ntc and msc groups . in contrast, the expression levels of  <dig> genes were significantly  affected by more than ± <dig>  fold between smk and ntc groups. notably,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were downregulated in smk . on the other hand, only  <dig> genes were significantly changed by more than ± <dig>  fold between msc and smk groups and the majority of the genes  were up-regulated in smk . importantly,  <dig> genes were similarly affected  in both smk-msc and smk-ntc comparisons .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes between smk and either msc or ntc samples. the number of genes which were significantly  up-regulated or down-regulated in pairwise comparisons are shown for each pairwise comparison. the venn diagrams show the number of overlapping up-regulated or down-regulated genes for smk-msc and smk-ntc pairwise comparisons




in general, the magnitudes of the gene expression changes in both comparisons were very small; only five genes were differentially expressed by more than 2-fold. for instance, the expression of igha <dig>  gpr <dig> and lrrn <dig> was changed by + <dig> , + <dig>  and + <dig>  fold between smk and msc, respectively. in addition, the expression of ccl <dig> and lrrn <dig> was changed by − <dig>  and + <dig>  fold between smk and ntc, respectively. these results are expected since all of the individuals in this study were generally healthy.

since the magnitudes of the expression changes were small, a total of  <dig> degs were selected for validation by quantitative rt-pcr in the same  <dig> subjects. among the  <dig> degs which were similarly affected in both smk-msc and smk-ntc comparisons, only seven degs were confirmed in smk-msc and  <dig> degs in smk-ntc comparisons . generally, higher magnitude changes were more likely to be confirmed by qrt-pcr. for instance, all four degs with > <dig>  fold change were validated by qrt-pcr, whereas only 23%  and 45%  degs with < <dig>  fold change were validated by qrt-pcr in smk-msc and smk-ntc comparisons, respectively .table  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of  <dig> degs that were similarly affected in smk-msc and smk-ntc pairwise comparisons

five out of eight up-regulated genes in both smk-msc and smk-ntc comparisons were confirmed by qrt-pcr. also, seven out of  <dig> down-regulated genes were confirmed in smk-ntc. in contrast, only two changes in smk-msc were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis. bolded values denote microarray changes that were confirmed by qrt-pcr. adenotes multiple qrt-pcr probes were tested but only the best result, with respect to fold change or p-value, is reported here. ‡, p-values were adjusted by fdr method for microarray experiments and by benjamini-hochberg method for qrt-pcr




functional analysis of expression data
to gain insights into the molecular and cellular pathways which may be involved in smoking related outcomes, we performed functional analysis on the degs to identify enriched pathways, process networks and diseases available in the metacore platform. we found that gdnf signaling  and chemotaxis  categories were significantly enriched in the smk-ntc differentially expressed genes . in addition, smk-ntc differentially expressed genes were highly enriched for pulmonary diseases such as obstructive lung disease , copd  and asprin induced asthma  as well as vascular skin disease  and hypersensitivity . importantly, nk cell related inflammation networks  and cd8+ tc <dig> cell related to copd  pathways were enriched for smk-ntc differentially expressed genes. in contrast, no disease categories and very few pathways and process networks were found to be significantly enriched for smk-msc differentially expressed genes .table  <dig> top pathway maps, process networks and diseases for degs in smk-ntc


p-values  were calculated using the hypergeometric test. only the top five categories are reported for each map




class prediction
to examine if pbmc gene expression profiling could be used to classify individuals into smk, msc or ntc groups, we utilized several different approaches. first, hierarchical clustering was performed using all ± <dig>  fold differentially expressed genes . the results showed that individuals in the three groups were interspersed and no clear gene expression pattern could be deduced by visual inspection. this is not surprising since many of the low magnitude changes by pairwise analysis could not be validated by qrt-pcr assays . therefore, we performed hierarchical clustering using the union of all ± <dig>  fold differentially expressed genes, which yielded only  <dig> unique genes . at least  <dig> smk subjects were clustered together and showed a distinct pattern of up-regulated genes. however, many of the remaining smk subjects were interspersed with ntc and msc subjects. in addition, ntc and msc subjects were intermingled and did not show a clear clustering pattern.fig.  <dig> clustering of  <dig> subjects based on blood expression profiles of  <dig> genes which were significantly different by ± <dig>  fold between smk and either msc or ntc subjects. a hierarchical clustering and heatmap representation of expression values for genes  across  <dig> subjects , where low expression is denoted by green and high expression by red. the expression of each gene was normalized across all samples. subjects were categorized into smk , msc , and ntc . b principal component analysis. subjects were projected according to the first three principal components, which accounted for  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the gene expression variance. subjects were categorized into smk , msc , and ntc . the centroid of each group is depicted by a larger symbol with lines radiating to all of the subjects in that group




next, we applied principal component analysis , which is a robust mathematical method for reducing the dimensionality of the data, to visualize the relationships between subjects based on the variation of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes across all subjects. when subjects were projected using the first three principal components, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation, we found that the centroids of the msc and ntc samples were closer together than to smk samples respectively . these results were consistent with the hierarchical clustering results and revealed a number of smk subjects whose gene expression profiles were similar to ntc and msc subjects.

lastly, to perform more rigorous classification analysis, we utilized the random forest  method, which is a multivariate classification method based on randomized decision trees. for each pairwise comparison, the rf model was trained on 50% of the subjects in each group and then tested on the remaining subjects. this process was repeated  <dig> times and the average sensitivity and specificity was calculated. the overall performance of the rf classifier for each pairwise comparison is reported as the area under the curve  from the receiver operator characteristic  curve, which displays sensitivity  as a function of false positive rate  at various thresholds . the highest auc for both smk-msc and smk-ntc comparisons was  <dig>  , which was achieved by using the top  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively .fig.  <dig> smk-msc random forest classification. a average auc for different number of genes are shown in this figure. the highest auc of  <dig>  is obtained using  <dig> genes. b average gini importance of genes across  <dig> runs of the model indicates the influence of the genes in correct classification  of smk and msc samples. c roc curve associated with the model achieving highest auc


fig.  <dig> smk-ntc random forest classification. a average auc for different number of genes are shown in this figure. the highest auc of  <dig>  is obtained using  <dig> genes. b average gini importance of genes across  <dig> runs of the model indicates the influence of the genes in correct classification  of smk and ntc samples. c roc curve associated with the model achieving the highest auc




as a by-product of training the rf classifier, each gene  can be scored with respect to its influence on splitting a sample into different classes, referred to as the “gini importance” value. using this approach, the influence of each gene on the class prediction can be determined, thereby allowing us to identify the most impactful biomarker genes that distinguish between smk, msc, and ntc subjects. gpr <dig> was the best gene predictor of smk for both msc and ntc comparison . in addition lrrn <dig> was the second highest predictor, but with substantially lower gini values in both comparisons . significantly, all  <dig> of the top predictor genes in smk-msc were also top ranked for predicting smk from ntc. these results indicate that there is a distinct set of biomarker genes that distinguish smk from ntc and msc groups.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that cigarette smoking results in significant changes in the expression of a small number of genes in pbmcs compared to either moist snuff consumers or people who do not consume tobacco. notably, this is the first study in which gene expression profiling is conducted in moist snuff consumers. as discussed in the background section, epidemiological data indicate that us and european smokeless products  have been associated with reduced risk compared to cigarettes. consistent with our published work , which showed that msc are exposed to reduced levels of combustion-related biomarkers of exposure, msc exhibited similar gene expression profiles as observed in ntc, but different profiles from smk. although the gene expression data are derived from a cross-sectional study, they could support the epidemiological findings in consumers of different classes of tobacco products.

through random forest classification approach we were able to identify a group of genes whose expression levels in pbmcs could accurately  predict smk from either msc or ntc groups . the top predictor genes for smk included gpr <dig>  lrrn <dig>  prss <dig>  sash <dig> and coch among others. separately, a  <dig> gene signature derived from whole blood, consisting of lrrn <dig>  sash <dig>  palld, rgl <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  cdkn1c, igj, rrm <dig>  id <dig>  serping <dig>  and fuca <dig> genes was reported to distinguish current smokers from nonsmokers and former smokers  <cit> . interestingly, several genes  were common to the discriminating set of genes for smk-ntc comparison  and the published signature  <cit> .

gpr <dig> gene encodes a g protein coupled receptor which acts as a chemokine receptor. consistent with our findings, several studies have shown that gpr <dig> expression levels and methylation status is associated with smoking and chronic inflammatory pathologies . similarly, the expression and methylation levels of lrrn <dig>  have been associated with smoking in various studies  <cit> . sash  <dig>  expression levels have also been associated with smoking and smoking-related atherosclerosis  <cit> . sash <dig> is believed to be a tumor suppressor in breast and colon cancer and has been shown to inhibit cell migration and enhance cell adhesion of epithelial cells  <cit> . an increased expression of sash <dig> in our study may reflect a host immune response to counteract smoking. the prss <dig>  belongs to trypsin family of serine proteases. the prss <dig> gene methylation status is correlated with smoking, but its expression does not appear to be different in the whole blood cells from smokers  <cit> . our data, however, show that there is a downregulation of prss <dig> in pbmcs of smk when compared to ntc and msc , and in smk vs ntc  . prss <dig> is suggested to regulate cellular proliferation and cancer  <cit> . in contrast, there is no evidence in the literature which associates coch  with smoking. thus our studies have identified several established gene expression markers for smoking and have revealed additional marker genes which may provide insights into future smoking research.

cigarette smoke exposure appears to affect pathways involved in immune response, chemotaxis, as well as inflammatory disorders and lung diseases. genes involved in stress response or metabolism known to be associated with smoke exposure were not identified in the functional analysis in either the smk versus msc comparison or the smk versus ntc comparison. this suggests that the effect of different categories of tobacco products on molecular pathways could be tissue specific and product category specific. for instance, in airway epithelium and the nasal and oral mucosa, cigarette smoke has been shown to affect pathways involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, tumor suppression, oxidative stress, detoxification, and carcinogen metabolism . studies of the effect of cigarette smoke on monocytes support the results of the present study, with genes related to inflammation, immune response, cell survival, and protein transport affected by cigarette smoke or its constituents .

our previous work showed that combustible tobacco product preparations  cause dna damage and are more cytotoxic than non-combustible tpps  <cit> . previous work from us  <cit>  and other researchers  <cit>  has shown that exposure to cigarette smoke constituent phases suppresses several immune responses, such as cytokine secretions in response to stimulation to toll-like receptors with agonists, and impairs cytolytic functions of the effector cells in pbmcs. such compromised immune responses, particularly of nk cells, are hypothesized to contribute to increased susceptibility of smokers to microbial infections and cancer  <cit> . further, the levels of perforin, which is an important cytolytic protein, are also suppressed in pbmcs exposed to the constituent phases of cigarette smoke  <cit> . consistently, the gene expression results show that prf <dig>  which codes for perforin, is downregulated in smk relative to msc and ntc; interestingly no significant differences were detected between ntc and msc .table  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of expression changes that were unique to either smk-ntc or smk-msc comparison

the expression of ahrr gene was also examined since it has previously been linked to smoking. bolded values denote microarray changes that were confirmed by qrt-pcr. adenotes multiple qrt-pcr probes were tested. only the best result, with respect to fold change or p-value, is reported here. ‡, p-values were adjusted by benjamini-hochberg method for qrt-pcr




our qrt-pcr experiments confirmed some well-known complexities associated with global profiling methods in general, and microarray approaches in this particular case. first, not all probes on the microarray may be appropriate for detecting the transcript levels for a given gene. for instance, microarray analysis did not detect a change in aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor  gene between smk and ntc. ahrr, a well-established repressor and regulator of aryl hydrocarbon receptor   <cit> , is widely reported to be hypermethylated in smokers  <cit> . in contrast to microarray results, our qrt-pcr analysis showed that ahrr transcript was elevated in smokers and was expressed at comparable levels in both smk-ntc and smk-msc comparisons . our finding that smokers exhibit higher levels of ahrr in pbmcs differs from that of other investigators  <cit>  who did not find differences in ahrr transcript levels between whole blood of smokers and non-smokers, perhaps reflecting on the cell types that comprised the starting materials for gene expression analysis. second, microarray analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences between msc and ntc groups after fdr correction. however, qrt-pcr analysis revealed at least two genes  which were significantly changed between smk and msc. it is generally recognized that fdr adjustment methods, while necessary to correct for multiple hypothesis testing error, can be too stringent and result in false negatives .

several previous studies  have shown that ahrr hypomethylation occurs in smokers, potentially activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway. consistently, we have found that in buccal cells collected from the same cohort of smk, several ahrr gene loci were prominently hypomethylated. ahrr methylation is not altered in msc relative to ntc .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this first genome-wide expression analysis of moist snuff consumers, we found msc expression profiles are very similar to ntc, while smk exhibit a distinct gene expression profile. specifically, previously described markers associated with smokers, such as ahrr, gpr <dig>  lrnn <dig>  coch and prss <dig> may serve as biomarkers to distinguish different tobacco product consumers.
