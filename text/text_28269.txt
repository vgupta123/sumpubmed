BACKGROUND
rearrangements of the cortical actin cytoskeleton are essential for numerous cell processes such as cell migration, phagocytosis  <cit> , and adhesion  <cit> , in which formation of dendritic networks of polymerised actin plays a key part. the arp2/ <dig> complex is required in the formation of dendritic networks to provide sites for de novo nucleation of actin filaments and to form branch points from existing filaments  <cit> . the mammalian arp2/ <dig> complex can be activated downstream of rho family small gtpases by several known interacting proteins, in particular members of the wiskott aldrich syndrome protein family   <cit> . homology between these proteins consists of a core proline rich region, and c-terminal wh <dig>  and acidic  domains, of which the wh <dig> and a domains together are sufficient to activate the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . n-wasp and the scar/wave proteins differ the most at the amino-terminus, designated the wiskott-homology  <dig>  domain and the scar/wave homology domain   <cit> .

regulation of wasp-family proteins involves many interactions and is still the subject of intensive research. wasp and n-wasp are found in an inhibitory complex with wip/cr <dig> proteins and can be activated by the small gtpase cdc <dig> and a co-activating protein toca- <dig>  recently described by ho et al.  <cit> . phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the n-terminal half of wasp/n-wasp can also enhance the activation and perhaps serve to prolong its duration . original reports had suggested that wasp/n-wasp were autoinhibited in their pure form, but whether this form is ever present in cells is unclear, so the physiological relevance of autoinhibition is unclear as well . recombinant scar/wave proteins were constitutively active toward arp2/ <dig> complex in vitro, but have been postulated to be regulated by the small gtpase rac in vivo  <cit> . in  <dig>  eden et al purified scar/wave <dig> from bovine brain extracts in association with a complex of four other proteins; p140-sra <dig>  p <dig> nck-associated protein , hspc <dig>  and abi <dig>  <cit> . they proposed a model whereby active rac could bind to p140-sra <dig> and cause it plus nckap <dig> and abi <dig> to dissociate, releasing active scar/wave in a complex with hspc <dig> 

some of the members of this so-called "scar/wave complex" had been previously studied by other groups and implicated in signalling. sra <dig>  is a rac associated protein which also binds to the sh <dig> domain containing adapter protein nck, and the fragile-x mental retardation protein   <cit> . nckap <dig> also interacts with active rac and nck, although the interaction appears to be indirect in both cases  <cit> . hspc <dig> is a small, ubiquitously expressed, uncharacterised haematopoeitc stem/progenitor cell protein, bearing considerable homology to the maize actin cytoskeletal associated protein brk <dig>  <cit> . abi <dig>  is a neuronally expressed sh <dig> domain containing protein associated with abl tyrosine kinase  <cit> . it has a close relative, abi <dig>  also referred to as e3b <dig>  in early literature  <cit> .

since eden et al., a similar complex has also been isolated in association with scar/wave <dig>  <cit> . this complex contains the more ubiquitously expressed abi <dig>  consistent with the more ubiquitous expression of scar/wave  <dig> compared to the other scar/wave isoforms  <cit> . in these studies, the complex does not dissociate upon rac activation and is not inhibitory during in vitro actin polymerisation assays  <cit> . recombinant abi <dig> is rather found to increase the arp2/ <dig> complex activating ability of recombinant scar/wave  <dig>  <cit> . following these studies, the mechanism for regulation of the different scar/wave proteins has been called into question. it has been proposed that differences between eden et al. and the other two studies may be due to experimental conditions or to genuine differences between scar/wave isoforms  <cit> .

knockdown of abi <dig>  sra <dig> and nckap <dig> in mammalian tissue culture cells causes severe defects in formation of lamellipodia  <cit> , similar to loss of scar/wave  <dig> activity  <cit> . mutations or rnai knockdown of the only drosophila scar/wave protein severely affects the ability of cultured cells to produce lamellipodia, ruffles and filopodia  <cit> . mutational and rnai studies used to produce drosophila cells deficient in the nckap <dig> homologue, kette, reveal a lack of actin based protrusions in the absence of functional protein  <cit> . rnai knockdown of drosophila abi <dig> and sra <dig> also prevents the formation lamellipodia in tissue culture cells  <cit> . dictyostelium knock out of scar protein exhibits severe defects in chemotaxis and motility, but cells can still extend pseudopods and migrate directionally  <cit> , whereas knockout of the pira gene encoding an homologue of sra <dig> causes an excessive lamellipodial protrusion phenotype, thought to be due to unregulated scar protein activity  <cit> .

while the scar/wave complex is currently thought to be the most likely regulator of scar/wave activity in cells, several other scar/wave binding proteins have been identified and proposed to regulate its activity. irsp <dig>  for example, binds to scar/wave <dig> and also to rac and was proposed to be a scar/wave <dig> regulator prior to eden et al. . it was unclear whether irsp <dig> binding was specific to scar/wave  <dig>  or ubiquitous among the scar/waves and where/when scar/wave was associated with irsp <dig> as opposed to the other binding partners. irsp <dig> is also a scaffold protein, with several partners, raising the possibility of at least two different types of large protein complexes in association with scar/wave proteins  <cit> .

scar/wave <dig> is the most tissue-specific of the three mammalian scar/wave isoforms, being found in haematopoietic cells and brain tissue, but not yet being characterised in cells  <cit> . it has not previously been shown whether scar/wave <dig> interacts with either abi1/ <dig> or hspc <dig>  this report presents data indicating that the interaction of scar/wave proteins with abi <dig>  hspc <dig> and irsp <dig> is conserved among all three scar/wave proteins, suggesting that multiple different protein complexes likely exist in cells that contain different scar/wave isoforms. this observation suggests that the different scar/wave isoforms are not regulated by exclusive participation in specific complexes, but rather that the regulation is likely to be more subtle, at the level of affinity or modifications/binding partners not yet discovered. alternatively, scar/waves may have largely overlapping functions when present in the same cell type, although there is already some evidence against this idea  <cit> .

RESULTS
association of the scar/wave complex with scar/wave 3
protein sequence conservation between the three scar/wave proteins in the n-terminal scar homology domain  indicates a potential for association of binding partners with all three members of the family. scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to associate with the key adapter protein abi <dig> through the shd, so it is possible that abi <dig> would also associate with scar/wave <dig>  <cit> . to test for an interaction between scar/wave <dig> and abi <dig>  immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies recognising abi <dig>  and antibodies recognising scar/wave <dig> . anti-abi <dig> immunoprecipitates co-precipitate scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> with endogenous abi <dig> from mouse brain extracts, while abi <dig>  scar/wave <dig> and scar/wave <dig> are not present in immunoprecipitates with an unrelated control antibody or without antibody . abi <dig> also co-immunoprecipitates with scar <dig>  but is not detected in the absence of antibody or in unrelated control immunoprecipitates . since abi <dig> is thought to bind directly to scar/wave proteins and to connect them with the rest of the scar/wave complex, interaction with abi <dig> is a strong indicator scar/wave <dig> associates in an analogous complex to scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> isoforms  <cit> .

conservation of scar complex association between all three human scar/wave isoforms
our data and previously published studies indicate that abi <dig> exhibits the potential to bind to all three mammalian scar/wave isoforms. to test whether the association of scar/wave <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with abi <dig> is mediated by the scar homology domain, myc-scar/wave shd of each of the three family members were transiently expressed in cos cells with ha-abi <dig> or ha-hspc <dig> and immunoprecipitated using a 9e <dig> anti-myc monoclonal antibody. ha-abi <dig> precipitated with each of the three shds, but not in the absence of antibody or myc-shd . ha-hspc <dig> also co-immunoprecipitated with all three shds, but not the negative controls . pull-down experiments performed from ha-abi <dig> or ha-hspc <dig> transfected cos cell lysates using gst-fusion proteins of scar/wave <dig> and  <dig>  and scar/wave <dig>  also show conservation of interaction of all human scar/wave isoforms with abi <dig> and hspc <dig>  supporting data showing the specific interaction of abi <dig> with scar/wave <dig> shd is shown in table  <dig> and additional file 1b. data supporting interaction of scar/wave <dig> shd with hspc <dig> is shown in table  <dig> and in additional file 1c.

conserved interaction of scar/wave isoforms with irsp53
conservation of scar homology domain binding partners raises the question of whether other binding partners of scar/wave are also capable of interacting with the entire scar/wave family. irsp <dig> has been implicated in regulation of actin dynamics through binding to scar/wave proteins  <cit> . gst-irsp <dig> was used for pull down experiments to test for binding to scar/wave <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . none of the scar/wave isoforms were detected in the beads fraction of a negative control , but all were detected in the beads fraction of gst-irsp <dig>  an ability to bind to irsp <dig> is conserved between all three human members of the scar/wave family, although the binding appears to be strongest for scar/wave <dig>  conservation of this interaction may indicate that all three scar/wave proteins are regulated by common mechanisms, but the increased binding of scar/wave <dig> to irsp <dig> highlights the possibility that differing affinities for binding partners between the three scar/wave isoforms may affect their roles in cells.

cellular localisation of scar/wave3
as an activator of the arp2/ <dig> complex, scar/wave <dig> would be expected to localize to the same areas of the cell as polymerized actin, subunits of the arp2/ <dig> complex, and members of the scar/wave complex. c2c <dig> cells were used for immunocytochemistry with anti-scar <dig> polyclonal antibody , phalloidin to detect filamentous actin , anti-arp2/ <dig> monoclonal antibody , and anti-abi <dig> antibody . c2c <dig> cells were used because they were the only standard tissue culture cell line that we found to contain a detectable amount of scar/wave <dig> protein . scar/wave <dig> mainly exists in a peri-nuclear pool with enrichment to areas of polymerised actin . scar/wave <dig> co-localises with the arp2/ <dig> complex subunit, arp <dig> , and with abi <dig>  in areas of lamellipodial protrusion. our results show scar/wave <dig> to localise to areas of polymerised actin near the cell periphery and to co-localise with a known component of the scar/wave complex, indicating that scar/wave <dig> may have a similar role and method of regulation to scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> 

cellular localisation of scar/wave shd, abi <dig>  and hspc300
if the shd of scar/wave protein mediates the interaction with a regulatory complex it can be expected that the shd will co-localise with binding partners in cells. ectopic expression of full length scar/wave isoforms in cells reveals a peri-nuclear and cytoplasmic pool, causing an abundance of polymerised actin in the cytoplasm, but with enrichment of scar/wave protein in lamellipodia  <cit> . a sizeable amount of myc-scar  <dig> shd , myc-scar  <dig> shd , and myc-scar  <dig> shd  localises to the cell periphery in lamellipodia, as well as in a cytoplasmic pool similar to full length scar/wave proteins . ha-abi <dig> is present throughout the cytoplasm in spots , previously described as characteristic of the reticulovesicular system  <cit> . ha-hspc <dig> exhibits a similar cellular localisation to ectopically expressed scar/wave <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> being abundant in and around the nucleus, and diffusely around the cytoplasm with enrichment at lamellipodia .

when expressed with myc-scar  <dig> shd , ha-hspc <dig>  co-localises  with enrichment in ruffles. myc-scar/wave  <dig> , and  <dig>  shd also co-localises with ha-hspc <dig>  in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and particularly strongly at areas of ruffles, shown as yellow in merge images . all three human isoforms behave the same in the presence of hspc <dig> consistent with a conservation of the interaction between scar/waves and hspc <dig> 

ha-abi <dig>  strongly co localises with myc-scar  <dig> shd , in unidentified punctate spots . myc-scar  <dig> shd  shows a similar co localisation with abi <dig> , whilst myc-scar  <dig> shd  shows partial co-localisation to abi <dig> . although myc-scar <dig> shd  co-localises to the ha-abi <dig> spots  to a lesser extent than scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> shd, leaving some diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus. abi <dig> expression affects the localisation of all three human scar/wave isoforms in cos <dig> cells, providing further evidence for a role of the scar/wave complex in regulation of the activity and localisation of scar/wave proteins. the staining pattern seen for overexpressed ha-abi <dig>  does not strongly correlate with the cellular localisation of endogenous abi <dig> . although the punctuate staining pattern seen in cells over-expressing abi <dig> has been described as being characteristic of the reticulovesicular system , it is also possible that these spots are protein aggregates induced by overexpression of abi <dig>  the relocalisation of scar/wave <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shds to these vesicles or aggregates may or may not be biologically important, but it does demonstrate the possibility that abi <dig> can affect scar/wave protein localisation in cells.

discussion
we show that abi <dig> and hspc <dig> interact with three human scar/wave isoforms, via the scar homology domain. conservation of abi <dig> binding between all three scar/waves is indicative of the association of the "scar/wave complex" with all three isoforms, as abi <dig> seems to be the link between scar/wave and nckap <dig> and sra-1/pir <dig> in previous reports  <cit> . association of the complex with all three scar/wave proteins is a possibility, as all the complex members are widely expressed throughout the body and seem to be found in all tissues where a scar/wave protein is expressed  <cit> .

little is known about the role of scar/wave <dig> in cells. expression of the mammalian scar/wave <dig> gene is largely limited to the brain and lung with relatively little expression in other adult tissues  <cit> . the major suggestion has been a role in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion indicated by localisation in neuronal growth cones and interaction with the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . association with a abi1-nckap1-sra <dig> does indicate a further potential role for scar/wave <dig> in lamellipodial protrusion given the requirement for these proteins in the ruffling process  <cit> . scar/wave <dig> is also implicated as a potential tumour suppressor protein in some ganglioneuroblastomas when the gene is down-regulated  <cit> .

the role of interaction of hspc <dig> with the scar/wave <dig> complex is unknown. loss of function of the brk <dig> gene product, the maize homologue of hspc <dig>  causes aberrations in cellular morphology and filamentous actin distribution of leaf epidermal cells  <cit> . this could indicate a role in regulating the localisation of actin polymerisation machinery, but this idea awaits further testing. hspc <dig> is also implicated in the frequency of occurrence of renal cell carcinoma  <cit> .

association of all three scar/wave isoforms with an abi-nckap1-sra <dig> complex may show that there is some functional redundancy between scar/wave family members but data from mice deficient in a scar/wave isoform indicates that scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> do not have completely overlapping functions  <cit> . the identification of specific binding partners for scar/wave <dig>  such as wrp, bad or the rii subunit of pka suggests a potential for differing roles between scar/wave proteins  <cit> . the conservation of the abi1-nckap1-sra <dig> complex between three scar/wave isoforms suggests that regulation of individual scar/wave proteins is likely to involve components that we have not yet studied  <cit> . other proteins that associate with the complex may perform this regulation, or tissue specificity may occur between the complexes formed where differentially expressed related proteins, such as abi <dig> or  <dig>  bind to alternative scar/wave isoforms with different affinities. further study of the scar/wave family and associated proteins will be required to fully understand the true roles and mechanisms of function of these complexes in cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that scar/wave <dig> is likely to participate in similar signalling complexes to scar/wave <dig> and  <dig> and that the differences between these scar/wave proteins is likely to be at the level of tissue expression, differences in affinity for certain binding partners and possibly interaction with yet undiscovered binding partners.
