BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is an important intestinal pathogen of man and animals  <cit> . it normally invades the host in the intestine leading to a self-limiting gastro-enteritis  <cit> , but it may also cause a systemic disease in which it resides inside professional phagocytic cells  <cit> . in mice it causes a typhoid-like disease, and in this model the contribution of many genes to disease is well-characterized  <cit> .

studies in the closely related bacterium escherichia coli have demonstrated that the transcriptional response to one stress-stimulus overlaps with the response to other stimuli in a highly adaptive manner  <cit> , creating an element of cross resistance towards different stress conditions. while the transcriptional responses of s. typhimurium during growth and in response to different environmental stress conditions have also been detailed  <cit> , a systematic analysis of how the s. typhimurium responses interact with each other has not been performed.

network analysis is a powerful tool to analyze interactions between different matrixes  <cit> . networks representing widely different things such as social relations  <cit> , molecular biochemical regulation  <cit>  and transcriptional responses in bacteria  <cit>  have all been shown to belong to the family of scale-free networks, which are characterized by the presence of hubs, i.e. highly connected nodes  <cit> . preferential attachment is a mechanism that explains the scale-free topology, i.e. new nodes link preferentially with the more connected nodes or hubs  <cit> . hubs confer an exceptional robustness to networks towards random node failures; however, directed attacks towards hubs theoretically cause a major network disruption  <cit> .

in transcriptional network analysis of bacterial responses to different growth conditions and different functionalities, such hubs would represent genes that are significantly regulated in response to many different conditions or which are involved in many different pathways and cell functions. from an evolutionary point of view it would be risky, if genes that form these connections were indispensable for cell functions, since mutation in one of these genes would then have consequences for the ability of the bacterium to adapt to many different conditions. in the current study we performed network analysis of transcriptional responses of s. typhimurium to a number of growth and stress conditions and of the global functionality of products encoded in the genome. we then analyzed the topology and the functionality of the most connected genes detected in these two networks and demonstrated that highly connected genes indeed were dispensable for growth, stress adaptation and virulence. hence it appeared that cellular networks of s. typhimurium were not susceptible to attacks directed towards single hubs.

RESULTS
transcriptional response to different environmental stresses share many genes, and genes that are up-regulated at one environmental stress condition are not likely to be down-regulated as response to another condition.

we constructed a microarray consisting of  <dig> carefully selected stress and virulence genes and used this to assess the transcriptional response of s. typhimurium to heat, osmotic, oxidative and acid stress under anoxic and oxic conditions and to non-stressed anoxic conditions. therefore, our study was not a genome scale transcriptional response analysis but it was focused on the regulation of the  <dig> genes most relevant for stress response and virulence. the selection of the  <dig> genes was based in numerous previous experimental evidences compiled in the genbank database and they represent the most suitable subset of genes to visualize gene expression under stress conditions; however, it is possible that some information could be missing regarding other genes not included in the array design. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to these environments . table  <dig> shows the number of genes up- and down-regulated under each environmental condition and the number of common genes whose regulation was affected in more than one assayed culture condition.

*the diagonal of the matrix shows the total number of genes up  and down  regulated in each condition . values in other positions show the number of common genes up  and down  regulated in both conditions.

to analyze the interactions in the transcriptional responses of s. typhimurium, a bipartite network, named network  <dig>  was constructed by connecting genes with environmental conditions according to expression pattern, i.e. up- or down-regulated . the modularity of this network was analyzed to find patterns of association among environmental stresses. modularity analysis investigates the existence of communities of highly interconnected nodes in the network that are not connected with other communities. the network modular structure is quantified by the modularity value, q, which can vary between  <dig> if no modules are detected and  <dig>  when modularity is at maximum. in practice it has been found that a value above  <dig>  is a good indicator of significant community structure in a network  <cit> . the q-value for network  <dig> was  <dig>  and the number of modules detected was  <dig> . one of the large modules grouped  <dig> genes that were up-regulated  under the assayed stresses, while the other large module contained  <dig> genes which were down-regulated. the third module was smaller and included  <dig> genes with variable expression. this indicates that those genes up- or down-regulated under one environmental stress are not likely to be down- or up-regulated as response to a different environmental stress.

as the modular structure indicated, there was a common transcriptional response to several stresses in many genes and no remarkable differences were noticed between stress responses under oxic and anoxic conditions in this respect. thirty-nine genes were detected as induced under one environmental condition and not induced or repressed under the other conditions . all the other detected genes were affected under more than one condition . cluster analysis of the environmental conditions according to their transcriptional profiles revealed that the distance between profiles observed under oxic and anoxic conditions for each stress was sometimes as large as the distance between profiles observed under different stresses . the greatest distance was observed between the transcriptional profile under non-stressed conditions and the profiles observed in stressed cultures. the response to anoxic conditions observed in stressed cultures was different from that observed in non-stressed situations. none of the  <dig> genes induced only under anoxic conditions in a non- stressed situation was up-regulated in the stressed cultures. therefore, the stress transcriptional response of many genes was common for different stresses. we targeted to explore those genes that were affected by a large number of stresses and culture conditions.

network analysis reveals the presence of hubs or highly frequent differentially transcribed genes responding to environmental stresses, growth stages and immobilization

to extend the information contained in network  <dig>  we constructed network  <dig> by adding to network  <dig> the transcription patterns associated with the growth stage and immobilization condition as can be found in the original publications  <cit> . in this way, we studied whether the transcription of the  <dig> genes contained in the microarray used above was affected by the growth stage and immobilization condition.

network  <dig>  connected genes with environmental stresses, growth stages and immobilization condition according to expression pattern. the layout of the network informed on common up- or down-regulated genes among the tested conditions. the lag period had the most distinctive transcriptional profile with few genes affected under other conditions. however, a small number of genes induced during lag phase were also induced in immobilized cells. the majority of genes down-regulated during lag and in stationary phase were not affected under any other situation. a large number of up-regulated genes in immobilized cultures were also induced in stationary phase. the transcription of several genes in response to environmental stresses was inversely related with their expression during exponential growth. figure  <dig> shows that the node representing genes induced during exponential growth was connected with few genes repressed under stressing environments while the node for genes repressed in exponential growth was linked with genes up-regulated in response to stress conditions.

the genes degree  distribution of the transcriptional response networks decayed as a power law, p ~ k– <dig> , i.e. the network belonged to the family of scale-free networks characterized by the presence of few highly connected genes or hubs corresponding to the genes that were differentially transcribed in many conditions. a list of  <dig> genes forming hubs in network  <dig> is included in supplementary material . figure  <dig> shows a sub-network extracted from network  <dig> , containing exclusively the  <dig> genes that formed hubs together with the conditions at which they were differentially transcribed. the transcription of none of these hubs was regulated during the lag phase.

analysis of the genome scale network for s. typhimurium shows a scale free topology with hubs formed by genes involved in many metabolic pathways and cellular functions.

to explore the presence of hubs in the genome of salmonella, we looked for genes involved in a large number of cellular functions and metabolic pathways in a genome scale bi-partite network  constructed for the genome and plasmids of s. typhimurium as previously described  <cit> . the network was bipartite and thus edges connected two sets of nodes – genes with metabolic pathways and cellular functions. information was collected from public available resources and databases specified in the methods section. the total number of nodes in the genome scale network was  <dig> of which  <dig> were genome and plasmid genes, while the remaining nodes were metabolic pathways and cellular functions. the distribution of the nodes degree  was estimated independently for genes, metabolic pathways and cellular functions and followed the power law in every case . the gene degree distribution was estimated using connections between genes and main functional roles and metabolic pathways only in order to avoid redundancies due to sub-classifications. the tail of the genes degree distribution  decayed as a power law p ~ k- <dig>  indicating the existence of highly connected nodes . a list of  <dig> highly connected genes as well as their connections with metabolic pathways and functional roles is included in supplementary material .

effect of single deletion of genes forming hubs on the growth and response to environmental stresses of s. typhimurium
the top five genes in terms of connections to other nodes of the network in network  <dig> and network  <dig> were selected . single mutants were constructed for eight of these genes in s. typhimurium strain 4/ <dig> , yajd, and dcoc from network 4), while mutagenesis of the gene ygau proved unsuccessful in several attempts and mutants of ybeb were unstable.

a summary of growth and stress response phenotypes of these mutants is given in table  <dig>  all tested mutants grew equally well as the wild type strain in lb broth at 37°c, as illustrated for  <dig> selected mutants in figure  <dig>  mutants were then subjected to a number of growth and stress conditions. as observed for growth at 37°c, mutants did not grow differently from the wild type at 15°c and 44°c, and their growth response to various concentrations of nacl and different ph values did not differ from that of the wild type strain . furthermore, the analysis of resistance towards h2o <dig> did not reveal any difference between wild type and single mutant strains .

effect of single deletion of genes forming network hubs on the virulence of s. typhimurium
virulence characteristics of seven of the eight genes were available from literature and were not repeated in the present investigation. according to literature, strains deficient in ygau, uspa, cbpa, ychn, siif  and dcoc were not significantly different from the virulence of the wild type strain  <cit> . the single deletions of wrab or osmc were even reported to increase the virulence of the mutated strains  <cit> . thus, none of these seven genes have been reported to be essential for virulence. challenge assays in mice were conducted with the yajd mutant. the deletion of yajd proved not to have a significant influence on the outcome of the infection .

1the competitive index  and its standard deviation  were calculated by dividing the proportion of mutant colonies in the spleen by the proportion of mutant colonies in the inoculum used to infect the mice, as previously reported  <cit> .

*the ci is significantly different from  <dig>  by one-sample t-test, indicating a significant change in the ability of the mutant strain to reside or propagate in mice with respect to the wild type.

effect of double mutation of genes forming hubs on growth, stress adaptation and virulence of s. typhimurium
s. typhimurium shows a high degree of redundancy in metabolic reactions  <cit> , and based on this we decided to test for interactions between gene-products of genes that formed hubs. twenty-three different double deletion mutants were constructed . no difference between wild type and mutated strains was observed during growth at the different temperatures, ph and nacl concentrations, while the resistance towards h2o <dig> was affected for eight of the double knockout mutants . this decreased resistance was more often observed when the mutated genes were environmental hubs. from the eight affected double mutants, four of them included the wrab environmental hub and three of them were deficient in cbpa, which is also an environmental hub. two of the double mutants deficient in osmc , ychn  and yajd  also exhibit a decreased resistance towards h2o <dig>  . five double mutants were also assessed for virulence. the competition indexes  of these strains are listed in table  <dig>  the ability of the mutants to propagate in mice was enhanced in one case and reduced in two: the wrab/ychn double mutant strain had a significantly increased ci of  <dig> , while the values of the ci for the wrab/osmc and the cbpa/dcoc double mutants were significantly reduced to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

discussion
we have detected a high degree of overlapping in the stress responses of s. typhimurium at the transcriptional level towards heat, oxidative, acid and osmotic stresses. such overlap could help explain the cross resistances in stress adaptation so often reported in literature  <cit> . previous work in salmonella has demonstrated that increased and cross resistance can be caused by hysteresis or memory, i.e. genes involved in resistance and induced during a stressful condition remain induced after the condition ceases  <cit> , and a recent study in e. coli has demonstrated that cross-stress protection also can arise in short time due to genetic mutations  <cit> . thus it may be that both memory in gene expression and short time evolution by adaptive mutations contribute to the phenomena of cross resistance.

our network analysis revealed that the nodes degree distribution followed the power law for both transcriptional and functional  networks. this meant that only few genes were detected as differentially transcribed in many situations and many genes were affected in few conditions, and at the genome scale few genes were involved in many reactions and most of the genes participate only in few reactions. therefore, the highly connected nodes in these networks, the hubs, represented genes that were differentially expressed under many conditions or which had several functions in the cell. our analysis was based on data extracted from three different strains of salmonella, and we cannot rule out that details may differ between the three strains. however, the general scape of the networks should remain strain independent. network analysis was based in the genome of s. typhimurium lt <dig> strain, which was different from the strains used to evaluate the stress response and to carry out mutations. however, a highly similarity in the genome composition of s. typhimurium strains has been previously reported  <cit> . for instance, the magnitude of the reported difference between s. typhimurium strains was in one case of two genes located in prophages  <cit>  while in another study the similarity was higher than 98% with the greatest difference attributable again to the distribution of prophages  <cit> .

hubs are considered the strength of scale-free networks from random failures and their achilles’ heel for directed attacks  <cit> . in order to investigate whether hubs were formed by essential genes in bacterial cellular networks, we carried out directed attacks by mutation of selected hubs in both network  <dig> and network  <dig>  this showed that deletion of genes that formed hubs in these networks did not affect growth, stress adaptation or virulence. despite the proven essentiality of hubs in other networks, hubs do not seem to be indispensable in cellular networks. this makes cellular networks more resistant to directed attacks addressing the weakest point of the scale free topology. this conclusion was based on analyses of four out of the five most connected genes in both types of network and a limited number of stresses, and we cannot rule out that mutation affects adaptation to stresses that we have not assessed. to aid the reader in evaluation of result, a short description of our results in the light of the current knowledge of the five most connected genes in both networks is included below.

the wrab gene of s. typhimurium encodes the wrba protein eliciting 94% sequence similarity to the e. coli wrba protein  <cit> . wrba was first suggested to be involved in the binding of the tryptophan repressor to the operator  <cit>  and recently identified as a novel flavoprotein  <cit>  with nadh-dependent redox activity and able to reduce quinones. it has been designated as a nadh:quinone oxidoreductase  type iv which are associated with oxidative stress  <cit> . however, in the current investigation, a wrab single mutant was found not to show any changes in phenotype under any of the tested conditions, including when subjected to oxidative stress by h2o <dig>  investigations regarding phenotypical changes of six double mutants where wrab was one of the mutated genes were also performed. four of these double mutants  showed a decreased ability to survive when subjected to oxidative stress by h2o <dig>  indicating functional redundancy with these genes for oxidative stress adaptation.

in the current study, mutagenesis of ygau proved unsuccessful. a comprehensive study of genes of importance for virulence in balb/c mice has demonstrated that deletion of ygau is possible, and that the gene is not essential for growth or for mouse virulence  <cit> . thus, despite our difficulties, we advocate that this gene too, can be considered non-essential for growth and virulence in s. typhimurium, while no results on stress adaptation are available.

ygau encodes an uncharacterized protein demonstrated to be induced by salt stress in e. coli <cit>  and to be a novel member of the rpos regulon in s. typhimurium  <cit> . it contains a bon domain, which is characteristic of osmotic shock protection proteins  <cit> , and a lysm domain, which was first reported in bacterial cell wall degrading enzymes and recently in other proteins with a variety of functions  <cit> . in the current investigation, ygau was found to be significantly regulated in eight tested conditions, but due to our difficulties with construction of a defined mutant we could not assess the importance for stress adaptation.

the cbpa protein of s. typhimurium elicits 89% similarity to the e. coli cbpa -standing for curved dna-binding protein a- and it is induced when cells approach the stationary phase  <cit> . it is a dnaj homolog demonstrated to act as a co-chaperone in conjunction with dnak  <cit> . regulation of cbpa activity is controlled at the transcriptional level by the rpos and lrp global regulators and at posttranscriptional level by degradation of cpbm by the lon and clpap proteases  <cit> . in the current investigation, cbpa was significantly regulated in seven tested conditions. the cbpa mutant was found not to show any changes in phenotype under any of the tested conditions, and four double mutants elicited similar lack of phenotypical changes. however, three other combinations of double mutants showed significantly decreased ability to survive under h2o <dig> stress .

the uspa  superfamily is widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants and in e. coli it is induced under a wide variety of stress factors  <cit> . the exact function of uspa is somewhat elusive, however, in some cases it appears to be of importance in defense toward dna damaging agents and respiratory uncouplers  <cit> . in s. typhimurium it has been demonstrated that uspa expression is induced during entry into stationary phase and by temperature up-shifts  <cit> . furthermore, mutants have been reported to have increased sensitivity towards oxidative stress, most pronounced in the exponential growth phase, and survival in minimal media was impaired  <cit> . virulence has also been reported to be affected in uspa mutants in both dose and infection route dependent manner  <cit> . in the current investigation, uspa was found to be significantly regulated in eight tested conditions. only one double mutant, uspa/siif , showed a significantly decreased ability to survive when subjected to oxidative stress by h2o <dig> 

the osmc protein of s. typhimurium shows 92% similarity to the e. coli osmc identified as a member of a family of osmotically inducible proteins widely distributed in bacteria  <cit> . osmc has been demonstrated to be of importance during long-term starvation of e. coli <cit>  and suggested to be a defense mechanism against oxidative stress  <cit> . the regulation of osmc transcription is highly complex  <cit>  and it is induced when entering stationary phase and by osmotic stress or ethanol  <cit> . in the current investigation, osmc was found to be significantly regulated in seven tested conditions, but the osmc single mutant did not show any phenotypic change under any of the tested conditions while two of the four osmc double mutants, osmc/wrab and osmc/cbpa, showed a significantly decreased ability to survive when subjected to oxidative stress.

the salmonella ychn protein is suggested to be a putative sulphur reduction protein. it has 92% identity to the e. coli ychn, but the function remains to be characterized  <cit> . it interacts with members of the csd system , which has been proposed to be involved in two sulphur transfer pathways: one involved in motility, while the other pathway is possibly important in stationary phase  <cit> . ychn was associated with  <dig> reactions and functions in our global genome network; despite this, the single mutant behaved like the wild type strain and we observed that only one of the double mutants deficient in ychn showed decreased resistance under oxidative stress.

the yajd protein is an uncharacterized protein containing a conserved hnh endonuclease signature found in viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins . the hnh superfamily includes restriction endonucleases, transposases, homing endonucleases, colicins and dna packaging factors  <cit> . the gene was associated with  <dig> reactions and functions in the genome scale network and two double mutants in this gene showed a decreased survival under oxidative stress .

siif  is present in the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  region  <cit>  which is predicted to contain six genes   <cit> . these genes were named siia-f  after it was demonstrated that they were not required for systemic infection by intraperitoneal injection  <cit> , but were essential for intestinal infection by oral administration  <cit> . however, a posterior study with intraperitoneal infection showed that some of the spi- <dig> genes, although not the siif gene, are important in long-term systemic infections in mice  <cit> . stm <dig>  has been shown to be part of a type i secretion system  encoding a putative abc-transporter which secretes siie. only one double mutant in this gene showed a decreased resistance towards oxidative stress although it is annotated with  <dig> reactions and functions.

the s. typhimurium dcoc gene encodes the gamma subunit of oxaloacetate decarboxylase. the protein also contains alpha and beta subunits, and it enables anaerobic growth on citrate and tartrate  <cit> . despite its function in central metabolism, only one double mutant showed decreased survival under h2o <dig> stress.

the ybeb gene product of s. typhimurium has 97% homology to the e. coli ybeb gene product and homologues are widely distributed amongst bacteria and eukaryotes  <cit> . the e. coli ybeb has been shown to be associated with the large ribosomal subunit   <cit>  and more recently, it was demonstrated to be important for survival during stationary phase as well as after transition from rich to poor medium  <cit> . it has been suggested that ybeb have a role in the down regulation of protein synthesis in stationary phase and under limited nutrition conditions by acting as a ribosomal silencing factor impairing the association of the 50s and 30s complexes. therefore, the protein was denoted as rsfa   <cit> . in our study strains with mutation in this gene were not stably obtained, which may indicate that this gene is essential.

apart from the decreased resistance to oxidative stress, some double mutants showed attenuated virulence in mice. the apparent interactions between these genes in virulence, i.e. wrab with osmc and cbpa with dcoc is currently unknown, but the transcription of osmc has been shown to be upregulated 2– <dig> fold in murine macrophage-like j774-a. <dig> cells and cbpa to be downregulated  <dig>  fold in both macrophages and hela cells during cell culture infections  <cit> .

as discussed above, mutation of a gene forming a hub in our networks would a priori according to network theory have be expected to result in broad-scale phenotypical changes of the population, however; we observed that hubs seem to have redundant functionality so that single hub deletion does not impact the phenotype and viability. this could be the result of evolution since mutations with a broad scale impact would be expected to be deleterious for the cell  and three in the transcriptional response to culture conditions network . these numbers support the fact that our hubs are not essential genes for growth, because a higher number of coincidences would be expected if hubs were essential genes. two of the essential genes reported by knuth et al.  <cit> , siif  and dcoc, were among the genes selected for knockouts construction in our work, and contrary to their results, our analysis resulted in viable mutants. similarly, at least another  <dig> of the reported essential genes in that study may actually be non-essential as independent studies demonstrated that gene inactivation resulted in viable mutants  <cit> .

we observed that the majority of double mutations did not result in growth defects or reduced ability to adapt to stress conditions with the exception of oxidative stress. on the other hand, two out of five double mutants showed attenuation in mouse virulence. many of the single non-redundant metabolic targets are already identified or too specific for salmonella to be antibiotics targets  <cit> . a systematic approach to identify lethal double deletion using in silico modeling has been undertaken resulting in a list of  <dig> putative synthetic double deletions affecting  <dig> genes  <cit> ; however the phenotype of the predicted double mutants was not experimentally assessed. only four of those  <dig> genes proposed as targets for double deletions, cysk and cysm, rfba and rfbb, were detected as hubs in our networks. indeed, the in silico approach of thiele et al.  <cit>  targeted to find essential pairs of genes and hubs seem to be non-essential genes. however, the hypothesis that targeting a number of hubs could cause the disruption of the cell main functionalities sooner than if other less connected gene products are affected may lead to alternative approaches for identification of antibiotics targets.

we have seen that the number of deleted hubs required for disruption of stress resistance and virulence in s. typhimurium seems to be equal to or greater than  <dig>  adaptive laboratory evolution experiments with e. coli have demonstrated a linear increase of the number of accumulated mutations as the number of generations increases, so that  <dig> mutations were detected after  <dig> generations  <cit> . assuming that the number of virulence and stress genes affected by random mutation follows a hypergeometric distribution, the probability that  <dig> successive random mutations affect two hubs is approximately 10- <dig> and  <dig> mutations, i.e. more than  <dig> generations, are needed to get a value greater than  <dig>  for the probability of at least two hubs are randomly mutated. this probability may be lower if considering that cellular networks can be rewired and cell behavior completely different after such a number of mutations and generations take place. although it seems to be a small value, the real dimension of this predicted probability for cell network failure cannot be easily evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we have found that highly connected genes or hubs in cellular networks are different from essential genes. the number of deleted hubs required for the complete disruption of stress resistance and virulence in s. typhimurium is  <dig> or more, which it may be relatively unlikely to occur spontaneously as quantified above.
