BACKGROUND
peptide aptamers  are small, artificially engineered proteins conceptually similar to antibodies  <cit> . pas consist of a stable, ideally inert scaffold protein with an inserted constrained peptide moiety. this in effect presents a small peptide surface within the tertiary structure of the scaffold which serves as the binding site for a target protein. in contrast to most of the more than  <dig> non-antibody scaffolds described to date  <cit> , pas are usually isolated by yeast-two hybrid screening of large libraries of pas that contain random peptide inserts against a bait protein of interest. selection of pas in eukaryotic cells in vivo may allow the identification of interactors that are more easily transferable to mammalian cells than interactors identified using in vitro techniques such as phage-display. pa technology is well established, with pas showing biological activity against a wide variety of proteins from different organisms, including the human and d. melanogaster cdk <dig> proteins  <cit> , the e. coli thymidylate synthase  protein  <cit> , the e <dig> and e <dig> proteins from human papilloma virus   <cit> , the human egf receptor  <cit> , and the transcription factors stat <dig>  <cit>  and the bcl- <dig>  <cit> . importantly, some pas have also been found to block functions of their target proteins in vivo, such as human cdk <dig>  <cit> , d. melanogaster cdk <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , e2f  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , stat <dig>  <cit> , nr- <dig>  <cit> , and bcl- <dig>  <cit> .

membrane-type  <dig> matrix metalloproteinase , is a member of the large mmp family of enzymes. mt1-mmp plays a major role in the dynamic remodelling of the extra-cellular matrix  and has been reported to directly degrade a broad spectrum of ecm proteins, including collagen types i, ii, and iii, fibronectin, laminin  <dig>  laminin  <dig>  fibrin, and aggrecan  <cit> . mt1-mmp has also been reported to activate prommp- <dig> and prommp- <dig>  <cit> , thereby indirectly increasing its proteolytic repertoire on or near the cell surface. the protease also plays a role in the processing of a growing number of membrane proteins, including, for example, cd <dig>  <cit> , transglutaminase  <cit> , the integrin αv chain  <cit>  or syndecan  <dig>  <cit>  thus modulating cell signalling and the cellular functions mediated by these molecules.

mt1-mmp has been implicated in a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological cellular functions  <cit> . mt1-mmp expression, well documented in many tumours, has been correlated with key in vitro and in vivo processes of tumour progression including angiogenesis  <cit> , cell migration and invasion  <cit> , cell growth  <cit>  and metastatic spread  <cit> . inhibition or silencing of the protease has been found to significantly reduce the invasive phenotype of tumour cells implicating a leading role for mt1-mmp in such processes  <cit> .

mt1-mmp is a type i transmembrane protein with a very short intracellular domain  of just  <dig> amino acids. the mt1-mmp icd has been reported to be required for cell migration and invasion  <cit>  as well as tumour growth  <cit> . the identification of proteins interacting with the mt1-mmp icd, such as mtcbp- <dig>  <cit> , and glcqr  <cit>  have also helped in defining new localisations and cellular functions for this protease. the mt1-mmp icd has also been implicated in the internalisation  <cit>  and the recycling of the protease to the cell surface  <cit> . consistent with this, mt1-mmp icd has been reported to interact with the μ <dig> subunit of the ap- <dig> complex  <cit>  as well as with caveolin- <dig>  <cit> 

to date, crucial information on the cellular function of the intracellular domain of the protease has been obtained following exogenous expression of mutant mt1-mmp icd constructs  <cit>  or constructs with a partially or completely deleted icd  <cit> . in order to assess the role of the mt1-mmp icd without using exogenously truncated or mutated forms of the protease, we decided to make use of pa technology.

in this study, we identify and characterize a pa, named swiggle, which interacts with the  <dig> amino acid icd of mt1-mmp. expression of swiggle in human cells was found to stimulate mt1-mmp mediated cell migration. detailed analysis of the phenotypic effect of swiggle revealed that the pa inhibits internalization of mt1-mmp resulting in the accumulation of the protease at the cell surface. our data indicate that swiggle interacts with the lly <dig> motif in the mt1-mmp icd and competes with the μ <dig> subunit of the ap- <dig> complex in cells, thereby inhibiting the endocytosis of mt1-mmp.

RESULTS
isolation of peptide aptamers that interact with the mt1-mmp icd
in order to identify pas that interact with the mt1-mmp icd, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as previously described  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid icd of mt1-mmp was fused to the lexa dna-binding domain  to generate the bait . as prey constructs, we used a library of  <dig> unique 10-amino acid residue peptides that were inserted into the active loop of the e. coli thioredoxin  scaffold protein. the prey constructs were transformed into the egy <dig> yeast strain, which was then mated with egy <dig> cells expressing lexa-mt <dig>  replica plating of the resulting diploids to selective media gave rise to  <dig> colonies where the leu <dig> reporter gene was activated. from these, only two plasmids were isolated that, when re-transformed into fresh egy <dig> cells, still led to the activation of the leu <dig> and lacz reporter genes in the presence of lexa-mt <dig>  these two pas were named swiggle and  <dig>  sequence analysis revealed that, as expected, swiggle comprises a  <dig> amino acid peptide within trxa . pa  <dig> was found to comprise a  <dig> amino acid sequence carboxy-terminal to the active loop of trxa . peptides longer than  <dig> residues arise when two or more peptide-encoding oligonucleotides ligate to each other during library construction. in this case, the 3' of the fused oligonucleotide encodes an in-frame stop codon. in contrast to swiggle, pa  <dig> is not constrained  at the carboxy-terminus and can be described as a linear peptide fused to the carboxy-terminus of a truncated trxa fragment , although it is possible that residues in this "peptide" form ionic or hydrophobic interactions with expressed regions of the trxa scaffold, leading to at least some element of three-dimensional constraint. blast searches of genbank with each pa insert sequence revealed no similarity with known proteins.

to confirm the interaction of the selected pas with mt1-mmp icd, yeast interaction mating experiments were performed  <cit> . haploid yeast strains expressing the lexa dna-binding domain alone , lexa dbd fusions to the mt1-mmp icd  or cdk <dig>  were mated with strains expressing b <dig> activation domain  fusions to trxa , swiggle ,  <dig>  or cyclin d <dig> . we included in this assay a fusion of the ad to a mutant variant of swiggle, called s <dig>  identified by random mutagenesis, which no longer binds to the lexa-mt <dig> fusion protein. s <dig> differs from swiggle by a single amino acid: gglipcyfmh in swiggle to gglipcyfth in s <dig> . resulting diploids were grown on selective media to identify positive  or negative  interactions. as expected, a clear interaction was observed between the lexa-cdk <dig> and ad-cyclind <dig> pair used as a positive control . lexa-mt <dig> did not bind to ad-trxa, ad-s <dig> or ad-cyclind <dig> but a clear interaction with ad-swiggle or ad- <dig>  could be observed confirming that both pas interact, via the inserted peptide, with the mt1-mmp icd. in some experiments, a weak interaction between the lexa-dbd and ad- <dig> could also be observed, suggesting that pa  <dig> may also recognize sequences or surfaces from the lexa-dbd . no interaction was detected between the lexa-dbd and ad-trxa, ad-swiggle, ad-s <dig>  ad- <dig> or ad-cyclind <dig> . ad-swiggle was also found to interact with the icd of mt2-mmp and mt3-mmp . ad- <dig> clearly interacted with lexa-mt <dig> and a weak interaction with lexa-mt <dig> was observed. ad-swiggle and ad- <dig> did not interact with the icd of mt5-mmp . taken together, our data clearly demonstrate an interaction between the mt1-mmp icd and both pas. the weak interaction between ad- <dig> and lexa-dbd, coupled with the truncated structure of pa  <dig> and its instability when expressed in e. coli and mammalian cells  led us to focus on swiggle in subsequent experiments.

gfp-swiggle co-immunoprecipitates with mt1-mmp in mcf <dig> cells
these interactions between swiggle and the mt1-mmp icd led us to test whether the two proteins could also interact when co-expressed in mammalian cells. trxa-based pas have previously been reported to be occasionally difficult to express in mammalian cells  <cit> . this was also the case for swiggle with poor expression observed in all the cell lines tested . increased swiggle stability and improved detection by western blot were achieved by fusing gfp to the amino terminus of the pa . addition of the tag also allowed detection of the pa by fluorescence microscopy. gfp was also added to the amino terminus of trxa and s <dig> to generate gfp-trxa and gfp-s <dig>  respectively. we used the human mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cells, which do not naturally express mt1-mmp  <cit> . mrna expression for mt2- and mt3-mmp in these cells is very low . mcf <dig> cells were co-transfected with mt1-mmp, and either gfp-swiggle or gfp-trxa. total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-gfp antibody followed by western blot analysis with an anti-mt1-mmp antibody . no mt1-mmp was found associated with the immunoprecipitates when the anti-gfp antibody was omitted  eliminating the possibility of non-specific binding of the gfp-tagged constructs or mt1-mmp to the beads. mt1-mmp was clearly found to co-immunoprecipitate with gfp-swiggle , but not with gfp-trxa  or gfp-s <dig> . together our data demonstrate that swiggle can recognise and interact with the mt1-mmp icd within human cells.

gfp-swiggle increases mt1-mmp-mediated cell migration
the interaction between the intracellular domain of mt1-mmp and swiggle in human cells led us to ask whether we could detect functional effects of the pa on an icd-mediated cellular function of the protease. the mt1-mmp icd has previously been reported to play an important role in promoting cell migration  <cit> . in order to test whether swiggle could alter icd-dependent mt1-mmp-mediated cell migration, we performed a cell migration assay  <cit> . untransfected mcf <dig> cells as well as cells expressing mt1-mmp alone, mt1-mmp and either gfp-s <dig> or gfp-swiggle were plated on colloidal gold-coated coverslips. after  <dig> hours incubation at 37°c, the areas of the phagokinetic tracks generated by cell migration were measured. as expected, very little migration was observed for untransfected mcf <dig> cells . expression of mt1-mmp alone resulted in increased  cell migration compared to untransfected cells  as previously observed  <cit> . to our surprise, expression of mt1-mmp and gfp-swiggle  resulted in a considerable increase  in cell migration compared to cells expressing mt1-mmp alone . expression of gfp-s <dig> did not have any effect on mt1-mmp-mediated cell migration . all told, cells co-expressing mt1-mmp and swiggle showed a 15-fold enhancement in migration compared to untransfected mcf <dig> cells. together, these observations indicate that expression of gfp-swiggle can affect a cellular function of the intracellular domain of mt1-mmp.

gfp-swiggle increases expression of mt1-mmp at the cell surface
another observed role for the icd is the internalisation of mt1-mmp from the plasma membrane  <cit> . the amplification of mt1-mmp-mediated cell migration observed after expression of gfp-swiggle could therefore be the result of an increased expression of the protease at the cell surface. to test this hypothesis, total exposed cell surface proteins of mcf <dig> cells over-expressing mt1-mmp, and either gfp, gfp-trxa, gfp-s <dig> or gfp-swiggle were biotinylated and immunoprecipitated using an anti-biotin antibody. the presence of mt1-mmp was then detected in the complexes by immunoblotting. inspection of total cell lysates indicated that the absolute levels of mt1-mmp were unaffected by co-expression of any of the gfp fusions. of this cellular pool, a similar amount of mt1-mmp was detected at the cell surface of mcf <dig> cells co-expressing gfp , gfp-trxa  or gfp-s <dig> . in contrast, the cell surface expression of the protease was clearly increased when gfp-swiggle was co-expressed with mt1-mmp .

the activity of cell-surface localised mt1-mmp can be assessed using a texas red-labelled gelatin  degradation assay  <cit> . mcf <dig> cells transfected with expression constructs for either mt1-mmp, a catalytically inactive mt1-mmp e240a mutant or an icd-deleted mt1-mmp  together with either gfp-swiggle or gfp-s <dig> were plated onto tr-gelatin coated slides and incubated at 37°c. as expected, untransfected mcf <dig> cells or cells expressing the catalytically inactive mt1-mmp e240a mutant were unable to degrade the tr-gelatin and this result was unaffected by co-expression of either gfp-s <dig> or gfp-swiggle . expression of active mt1-mmp alone in mcf <dig> cells resulted in a clear degradation of the tr-gelatin  as previously observed in cho-k <dig> and cho l <dig> cells expressing the protease  <cit> . a similar level of tr-gelatin degradation was also observed in cells co-expressing mt1-mmp and gfp-s <dig> . in contrast, expression of mt1-mmp together with gfp-swiggle resulted in a  <dig>  fold increase in the average area of tr-gelatin degradation per cell  compared to mcf <dig> cells expressing mt1-mmp alone or together with gfp-s- <dig> . increased tr-gelatin degradation was not observed in mcf <dig> cells expressing an active mt1-mmp with a deleted icd   <cit>  or in cells co-expressing mt1-mmp Δicd and gfp-swiggle or gfp-s <dig> . together, these data show that gfp-swiggle is able to increase the levels of mt1-mmp activity at the cell surface through interaction with the mt1-mmp icd. consistent with the increased level of mt1-mmp protein at the surface of cells expressing gfp-swiggle, these data also confirm that the increase of the protease at the cell surface is mediated by the interaction between gfp-swiggle and the icd of mt1-mmp.

swiggle inhibits mt1-mmp internalization
the simplest explanation for the swiggle- and icd-mediated increased expression of mt1-mmp at the cell surface is that gfp-swiggle expression results in a perturbation of the internalization of the protease  <cit> . we tested whether expression of gfp-swiggle could interfere with the internalization of the protease by performing an antibody internalization assay using the n <dig> anti-mt1-mmp pab. this antibody is directed against the whole extracellular domain of the protease and recognises full length as well as the  <dig> kda inactive form of the protease  <cit> . mcf <dig> cells expressing mt1-mmp, and either gfp-s <dig>  or gfp-swiggle  were incubated with an anti-mt1-mmp antibody on ice, and then warmed to 37°c to restore endocytosis. in cells expressing mt1-mmp alone  or mt1-mmp and gfp-s <dig> , the antibody-bound mt1-mmp originally present at the cell surface  was quickly internalized at 37°c. accumulation of vesicles containing antibody-bound mt1-mmp was clearly observed in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing gfp-s <dig> , demonstrating that the mt1-mmp antibody complex was internalized in these cells. in contrast, in mcf <dig> cells expressing mt1-mmp and gfp-swiggle , we observed a marked reduction of vesicles containing antibody-bound mt1-mmp, with most of the mt1-mmp antibody complex present at the cell surface when the cells were incubated at 37°c . a low level of internalization of antibody bound mt1-mmp complexes could however be detected by  <dig> minutes  in cells expressing gfp-swiggle. quantification of mt1-mmp endocytosis mcf <dig> cells transfected with mt1-mmp and gfp-s <dig> or mt1-mmp and gfp-swiggle after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> minutes at 37°c is presented in figure  <dig> 

swiggle interacts with the mt1-mmp lly <dig> internalization motif
the internalisation of mt1-mmp has been shown to be able to occur via clathrin- or caveolin-mediated pathways  <cit> . because mcf <dig> cells do not express detectable levels of caveolin- <dig>  <cit> , we asked whether gfp-swiggle was able to interfere with the clathrin-mediated internalisation of the protease.

clathrin-mediated endocytosis of mt1-mmp has previously been shown to involve the μ <dig> subunit of the adaptor protein ap- <dig>  which interacts with the lly <dig> motif found in the mt1-mmp icd  <cit> . therefore, the inhibition of mt1-mmp internalization observed following expression of gfp-swiggle could potentially result from a disruption of the interaction between mt1-mmp and μ <dig>  the first test of this hypothesis was to ask whether the lly <dig> motif required for μ <dig> binding is also required for binding by swiggle. we therefore generated a lexa-mt <dig> lly/a triple mutant, where the lly <dig> motif in the mt1-mmp icd was replaced by aaa <dig>  and tested its interaction with ad-swiggle in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. as before, we were able to detect a strong interaction in yeast expressing lexa-mt <dig> and ad-swiggle . in contrast, no interaction was found between lexa-mt <dig> lly/a and ad-swiggle  suggesting that the lly <dig> motif of mt1-mmp plays a crucial role in the interaction between swiggle and the mt1-mmp icd.

if swiggle and μ <dig> both bind to the lly <dig> motif of mt1-mmp, then expression of swiggle should competitively inhibit the interaction between μ <dig> and mt1-mmp in cells. to test this idea, mcf <dig> cells were transiently co-transfected with mt1-mmp alone or with mt1-mmp together with gfp-s <dig> or gfp-swiggle. total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-mt1-mmp antibody and immune complexes were probed with anti-μ <dig>  -mt1-mmp and -gfp antibodies. as shown in figure 8b, we observed a clear co-immunoprecipitation of mt1-mmp and μ <dig> when the protease is expressed alone , or in the presence of gfp-s <dig> . in contrast, we were unable to detect μ <dig> in complexes immunoprecipitated from mcf <dig> cells expressing mt1-mmp and gfp-swiggle , thus demonstrating that expression of the pa inhibits the formation of a complex between the protease and the μ <dig> subunit. taken together, our data suggest that the inhibition of mt1-mmp endocytosis observed following expression of swiggle probably results from the interaction of the pa with the lly <dig> motif of the mt1-mmp icd, thus disrupting the interaction of the mt1-mmp icd with the μ <dig> subunit. our results thus suggest a potential mechanism for the amplification of the effects of mt1-mmp on cell migration by gfp-swiggle. they also demonstrate that swiggle binding to the icd can inhibit endocytosis of mt1-mmp without affecting communication between the icd and the machinery required for cell migration.

discussion
in this study, we have described the isolation and characterisation of a pa, called swiggle, which binds to the icd of the membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase, mt1-mmp. our results have several implications for pa technology. firstly, we have demonstrated that pas can be successfully obtained against small intracellular domains of transmembrane proteins. although short peptides have previously been used in yeast two hybrid interaction assays, for example to map interaction domains, the  <dig> amino acid mt1-mmp icd bait is approximately three times smaller than the previous smallest published bait used in a screen, a  <dig> amino acid c-terminal portion of the hpv- <dig> e <dig> protein  <cit> . our bait is also more than six times smaller than the only other published icd used in a pa screen, the  <dig> amino acid icd of the egf receptor  <cit> . given the dearth of tools to directly study the biology of the mt1-mmp icd, which could be attributed to its small size, this study raises the possibility that pa technology could be used to generate tools to study the biology of other small intracellular domains, such as integrins, that were previously difficult to study.

pas have traditionally been found to produce inhibitory phenotypes by blocking certain functions of their target proteins  <cit> . for example, pas that interacted with the human papilloma virus  e <dig> oncoprotein could block e6-mediated degradation of p <dig>  resulting in increased p <dig> protein levels, growth inhibition and apoptosis in hpv-positive hpv <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, we found that expression of gfp-swiggle resulted in an increase in both mt1-mmp-mediated tr-gelatin degradation and cell migration. furthermore, gfp-swiggle appeared to affect the amount of mt1-mmp at the cell surface. this increased gain of function migratory phenotype caused by gfp-swiggle is unique, although it is consistent with the original prediction for the mechanism of pa function  <cit>  in that it appears to result from a loss of function, namely reduction of the rate of endocytosis of mt1-mmp. although a previous study has described a pa that stimulates its target protein, calcineurin, this pa was identified from an anti-proliferative phenotypic screen, rather than a yeast-two hybrid screen with a defined bait  <cit> . the phenotype of this pa is also the opposite of swiggle, with a gain of function of its target resulting in a loss of function phenotype. together, these studies thus demonstrate the broad applicability of pa technology to the dissection of cell biology.

the increase in mt1-mmp mediated cell migration and tr-gelatin degradation mediated by gfp-swiggle most probably results from the inhibition of endocytosis leading to increased levels of the protease at the cell surface. however, icd mutants used in other studies that resulted in increased levels of mt1-mmp protein at the cell surface did not cause any effect on cell migration/invasion  <cit> . for example, over-expression of wild type mt1-mmp leads to increased cell migration and invasion, but truncations of the icd including the lly <dig> residues, or removal of the whole of the icd prevented these effects  <cit> . this appears paradoxical as truncations that decrease the rate of mt1-mmp internalization should result in more mt1-mmp being present at the cell surface, and hence more proteolytic/migratory activity. one possible explanation for this observation is that the lly <dig> motif of the mt1-mmp icd is required both for clathrin-mediated internalisation and mt1-mmp-mediated cell migration. however, no tools previously existed to test this idea. our results now show that the expression of gfp-swiggle reduces the rate of internalization of mt1-mmp and results in an increased amount of mt1-mmp at the cell surface, mimicking this aspect of lly <dig> mutation. but unlike the icd lly <dig> mutation, gfp-swiggle also allows cell migration to proceed.

a potential caveat of our experiments as well as those of  <cit> , is that the majority of the assays that were used were only sensitive to over-expressed levels of mt1-mmp. while this may reflect the pathological situation in cancer cells, further work is needed to assess whether gfp-swiggle can perturb other functions of mt1-mmp in normal cells through the development of assays that are sensitive to endogenous levels of mt1-mmp.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified and characterized a pa that, when expressed in mammalian cells, can inhibit the clathrin-mediated internalisation of mt1-mmp by interacting with the normal function of the icd of the protease. in addition to laying the ground-work for the study of the mechanism of endocytic recycling of transmembrane mmps, this pa should be a useful tool in further studies of mt1-mmp in the existing wide range of biological and disease models.
