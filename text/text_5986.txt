BACKGROUND
bats belong to the order chiroptera, which is one of the largest monophyletic clades in mammals. they constitute ~20% of living mammalian species with about  <dig>  bat species worldwide  <cit> . bats have long been regarded as special animals for the sake of being mysterious flyers of the night, and one of the few mammals that can use echolocation to navigate in the dark  <cit> . although many mammalian species are capable of detecting ultrasonic sounds , only toothed whales and laryngeal echolocating bats have the most advanced auditory systems for detecting ultrasonic sound  <cit> . laryngeal echolocating bats can emit broad ultrasound frequency sounds and listen to their echoes, allowing them to orient in the dark and exploit food sources of the night sky. however, not all bats have laryngeal echolocation ability. traditionally, bats can be divided into two suborders, the ‘megachiroptera’  and the ‘microchiroptera’ , identified mainly on the basis of their morphology and echolocation characteristics  <cit> . megachiroptera, consisting of a single family, is a smaller group of bats that mainly live in the old world tropical places. they have good dim light vision and do not have laryngeal echolocation ability, whereas microchiropteran bats can use sophisticated laryngeal echolocation for orientation  <cit> .

with special morphological and physiological adaptations, echolocation allows bats to listen for their high frequency echoes to locate their prey in the dark. the cochleae of these bats are well-developed and show adaptations for detecting their own ultrasonic sounds  <cit> . the cochlea is a key auditory system of the inner ear and is specialized for the use of high frequency sounds in the echolocating bats. it has been documented that the variation of cochlear size is associated with echolocation strategies  <cit> , and the cochlea diameters of laryngeal echolocating bats are higher than those of many non-echolocating megabats  <cit> . these phenotypic adaptations are thought to play important roles in the reception and funneling of high frequency echoes. laryngeal echolocation is a highly technical and physiological adaption, however the molecular basis responsible for this phenotype is poorly characterized for the differences between echolocating and non-echolocating bats.

divergence of gene expression is an important component of species evolution and essential means to generate biological diversity  <cit> . recent next-generation sequencing technologies provided us a large-scale platform to address evolutionary questions involving non-model organisms for which there are still limited genomic resources  <cit> . in this work, we explored the utility of next-generation sequencing technologies for the comparative inner ear transcriptome analyses between the rickett’s big-footed bat  and the greater short-nosed fruit bat . the rickett’s big-footed bats are species of microbats in the family vespertilionidae. they have advanced laryngeal echolocation ability, which belongs to frequency modulated type; the greater short-nosed fruit bats are species of megabats and come from the family pteropodidae without laryngeal echolocation. based on more recent molecular phylogenetic studies, the divergence time between these two bat species is around  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . the genome sequences of these two bat species are still lacking, and we employed a de novo assembly approach to gain insight into the genome-wide expression divergence patterns between the rickett’s big-footed bat and greater short-nosed fruit bat. the main purpose of this work is to elucidate the nature of transcriptomes of bat species and determine to what extent the two bat species with different hearing traits differ in gene expression. this study provided an initial step to comprehensively understand the inner ear transcriptome involved in the bat echolocation.

RESULTS
de novo assembly and functional annotation
sequencing of the mrna in the inner ear of rickett’s big-footed bat  and the greater short-nosed fruit bat  based on illumina genome analyzer ii generated a total of  <dig>  gbp of sequence from approximately  <dig> million paired-end 75 bp reads .

because no reference genomes was available for m. ricketti and c. sphinx, we employed a bioinformatics de novo assembly method  in our work. after trimming the adapter sequences and removing sequences with low quality, we used trinity software  <cit>  to generate de novo assemblies of each species, resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  non-redundant contigs in m. ricketti and c. sphinx, respectively. the detailed assembly results are summarized in table  <dig>  next, we performed an analysis of the length distribution of these assembled contigs in two bat species. we excluded all contigs with the length shorter than 200 bp from further analysis because of their short length rendering them useless for most applications. as shown in figure  <dig>  nearly 50% of the contigs are between  <dig> to 350 bp, and we even identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs with their lengths longer than  <dig>  bp in m. ricketti and c. sphinx. to assess the quality of our assembled contigs, we downloaded all cdna sequences  of m. ricketti and c. sphinx from ncbi genbank database  and regarded them as reference sequences. we compared our assembled contigs against these reference sequences using blastn , and the best-hit contigs were aligned using mafft  <cit> . the fractions of mismatching nucleotides were subsequently calculated. we found that assembly error rates are only ~ 2% relative to the reference transcripts. our result demonstrated that the assembled sequences of short-read sequences have considerable utility for comparative genomic analysis.

next, a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs were aligned against the non-redundant uniprot database using blast . we used gene ontology  categories from database to assign their putative biological functions. to improve the go annotation quality, we only selected the go annotations that are based upon direct experimental evidence codes. as a result,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were annotated with at least one go functional category in m. ricketti and c. sphinx, respectively. these two bat species represent similar go functional annotations. among the broad go category ‘biological process’, regulation of transcription, dna-dependent  and transcription, dna dependent  were most highly represented. in addition, of the transcripts annotated with ‘molecular function’ terms, the most represented categories were ‘protein binding’  and ‘zinc ion binding’  .

transcripts differentially expressed between m. ricketti and c. sphinx
to investigate the expression patterns of the inner ear in bats, we separately evaluated the number of reads assembled from each library for each transcript and compared gene expression difference between m. ricketti and c. sphinx. because of the differences in library size , inter-sample normalization was performed at first. transcript abundances were quantified using rsem software  <cit>  in which a generative statistical model is used to solve the problem of read mapping uncertainty. in this work, ebseq method was used  <cit>  to calculate the scaling factor and gauge gene expression differences between m. ricketti and c. sphinx. as expected, we found significant correlation in expression between these two samples . a total of  <dig>  genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed between m. ricketti and c. sphinx among  <dig>  orthologous genes, and there were  <dig> genes that were significantly highly expressed in the inner ear of m. ricketti. the number of differentially expressed genes being up-regulated in the non-echolocating bat  is higher than the number of genes being up-regulated in the echolocating bat , indicating that echolocation is not simply a problem of numbers of highly expressed genes, but might confine to only a few gene categories.

to gain insights into biological implications of differentially expressed genes, we performed a go enrichment analysis for the gene set. go terms are organized into three sub-ontologies: ‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’  <cit> . the three categories characterize different aspects of gene’s function and only the categories of ‘biological process’ and ‘molecular function’ are examined in our work. in the up-regulated genes in the c. sphinx, there are six over-represented go categories, some of them related to regulation of cell cycle and development . in the up-regulated genes in m. ricketti, there are seven significantly enriched go categories in terms of ‘biological process’ and three go categories in terms of ‘molecular function’ . interestingly, we found three go categories related to auditory organs development or auditory process . we defined the genes in these three go categories as hearing-related genes.

quantitative rt-pcr analysis of tmc <dig> gene in five mammalian species
our study comprehensively proved that there are dramatic expression divergence of the inner ear between the echolocating bats and non-echolocating bats. echolocating bats underwent a unique suite of cochlear morphological modifications that enabled them to receive their high-frequency ultrasonic echoes. our results are in line with previous morphological work that the cochlear apparatus in the inner ear is proportionately larger in the echolocating bats than in other animals  <cit> . the genes related to cochlear morphogenesis are preferentially expressed in the inner ear, which makes it possible for the echolocating bats to achieve great hearing sensitivity and perception. notably, we found that  <dig> hearing related genes  have significantly higher expression level in the echolocating bat. among these hearing related genes, tmc <dig> gene showed the most significant difference between m. ricketti and c. sphinx, with a ~ <dig> fold higher expression in m. ricketti. tmc <dig> encodes transmembrane protein of the inner ear acting as an intracellular regulatory signal during the hair cell maturation  <cit> . recent works have documented that tmc <dig> gene underwent positive darwin selection in the lineage leading to myotis lucifugus <cit>  and myotis davidii <cit> , which indicated that tmc <dig> gene might be an important bat echolocating related gene. in order to validate the expression level of tmc <dig> gene in the inner ear and extend to other species, real-time pcr was then adopted to five mammalian species . tmc <dig> mrna levels vary in different species, and it showed significantly higher expression level in the m. ricketti and m. davidii compared with the c. sphinx, m. musculus and r. norvegicus . m. ricketti and m. davidii are all laryngeal echolocating bats having the most sensitive hearing at high frequencies, and tmc <dig> gene of these two laryngeal echolocating bats have the highest expression level than the non-echolocating bat and two rodents.

discussion
we have performed the novel inner ear transcriptome of two bat species  using illumina sequencing technology. as was first proposed for over several decades ago, alterations  in gene expressions were regarded as essential means to generate biological diversity  <cit> . the characterization of transcriptome is essential to distinguish the functional implications of different species and to obtain a better understanding of their biological complexity. so, the analysis of differentially expressed genes can elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphological diversity and provide a better understanding of the relationship between gene expression patterns and the resultant morphologies. to our knowledge, this work represents the first effort to comparatively analyze the inner ear transcriptome of the bat species resulting in a reference transcriptome of more than  <dig>  annotated genes from the m. ricketti and c. sphinx which represent the echolocating bat and non-echolocating bat, respectively.

our transcriptome work based on next-generation sequencing technology attempted to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of the auditory system between the echolocating bat and non-echolocating bat at transcription level. compared with other next-generation sequencing technology, such as roche  <dig> technology, the illumina solexa platform offers a higher sequencing depth with considerably less cost, which ensures more complete coverage of the transcriptome. in this work,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were assembled for m. ricketti and c. sphinx, respectively. we evaluated the quality and quantity of short-read assemblies and proved that short-reads transcriptome assemblies are large in quantity and high in quality for further analysis, which can provide considerable utilities for non-model organisms.

bats are amongst the few mammal species that use sophisticated echolocation. the generated high-frequency calls bounces off surrounding objects and the returning echoes allows them for the detection, localization and classification of these objects with extraordinary acuity. this astonishing sensory ability enables bats to navigate in the dark. although bats are not the only mammals to have evolved ultrasonic echolocation, they are certainly the most developed species of the laryngeal echolocation. fossil evidence suggests that bats might echolocate even at an early stage of their evolution  <cit> . however, none of the old world fruit bats have laryngeal echolocation ability, and they use their sense of vision to locate food  <cit> . as we know, the sound waves enter the ear and travel until they reach the middle ear. the auditory ossicles will vibrate as a response to the sound waves, and the stirrup bone transmits vibrations into the inner ear. then, the pressure waves flatten the hair of the inner ear and made them perceived as a sound. the inner ear consists of a cochlea which is a spiral-shaped cavity that functions as sound reception and processing apparatus for hearing. cochlea functions as sound reception and processing apparatus in the inner ear, and its size is known to be correlated with echolocation behavior, and the cochlea structure significantly contributed to the diversification of bat species  <cit> . a recent work reconstructed three-dimensional inner ear volumes of both echolocating and non-echolocating bats, and found that hearing in bats correlated with both measures of cochlea morphology  <cit> . in this work, we evaluated and compared the expression difference between echolocating and non-echolocating bats, and found that hearing-related genes show significantly differential expression. organs in the body always exhibit specialized forms that are essential for their functions. although bat echolocation calls show a great diversity in duration and shape, all echolocating bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range. the expressions of inner ear/cochlea morphogenesis genes are responsible for the senses of hearing and balance, which might associate with high-frequency hearing ability. based on morphological and anatomical analyses, the cochlea is enlarged relative to other skull structures in the echolocating bats, which makes them able to detect, and discriminate between high-frequency calls, whereas non-echolocating bats tend to have smaller cochleae than bats that use laryngeal echolocation  <cit> . as we know, the generation of animal inner ear requires coordination between morphogenesis and cell fate specification  <cit> . the inner ear/cochlea morphogenesis genes are highly expressed in echolocating bats, which are consistent with these findings that the cochlea of echolocating bats is enlarged relative to other skull structures.

most previous works focused on morphological comparison between echolocating bats and non-echolocating bats. it has been documented that gene expression differences might be important contributors to echolocation-specific features  <cit> . we compared the gene expression divergence between m. ricketti and c. sphinx, and aimed to put these expression differences in context by comparing them to the high-frequency hearing traits. of the two bats we examined, the inner ear of m. ricketti was found to have higher expression level of hearing related genes and inner ear morphogenesis genes, such as tmc <dig> gene, which is probably an adaptation to their developed auditory tuning to their high-frequency calls. tmc <dig> gene is involved in hair cell structure and function, and show evidences of positive selection exerted on the some echolocating bat species  <cit> . thus, the study of the development of bat inner ear is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of ear with high-frequency hearing ability. we previously demonstrated the importance of prestin gene in high frequency hearing mammals  <cit> . however, prestin was shown a low expression value in both species, and no significant expression difference was found between m. ricketti and c. sphinx in this work . although the sequence evolution of prestin contributes to the evolution of bat hearing, the result shows that echolocation of bats isn’t associated with the transcription level of prestin gene.

it has been realized that stabilizing selection is likely to be the dominant signature of expression evolution  <cit> . although the expression evolution between two species involves different habitat use or ecological niches, the mode of expression divergence is largely explained by neutral evolution and not of direct adaptive significance. moreover, the neutral view of gene expression divergence asserts that the functionally irrelevant component of gene expression evolves neutrally. based on this scenario, the vast majority of gene expression divergences between two species should reflect neutral  variations. based on this principle, most of expression changes between two species are likely to be of no direct significance. however, high-throughput expression analyses of the inner ear have shown that abnormal events of gene expression of deafness genes in the inner ear is associated with a varying degree of hearing loss  <cit> . furthermore, the finding of the enlarged cochlea relative to other skull structures in the echolocating bat can be well explained by the elevated expression of cochlea/inner ear morphogenesis genes. although we still cannot accurately describe a more precise expression evolution trajectory history at the current form, our work provides a starting point for experimental follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS
the study of inner ear gene expression divergences between m. ricketti and c. sphinx using next generation sequencing technology revealed the extent of inner ear transcriptome evolution between the echolocating and non-echolocating bat, and identified a number of novel candidate genes associated with the echolocation ability. revealing the difference of auditory systems between echolocating bats and non-echolocating bats not only provided better insight into understanding the causes of high-frequency sound hearing ability of echolocating bats, but has also opened an opportunity into exploring how the echolocation evolved in bats.
