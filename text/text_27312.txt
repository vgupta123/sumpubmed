BACKGROUND
in this study we examine the ability of the nuclear coactivator ncoa <dig>  to function in protection against oxidative dna damage. oxidative dna damage occurs when reactive oxygen species  attack dna. ros are produced as by-products of aerobic metabolism and the damage produced by ros has been implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging  <cit> .

a number of cellular processes function to prevent the lethal and mutagenic effects of ros. protective enzymes fall into two broad categories, those that prevent oxidative dna damage from occurring and those that repair dna damage caused by ros. the damage prevention genes include a wide array of enzymes such as catalases, superoxide dismutases, peroxidases, and thiol containing proteins that detoxify ros, thereby preventing them from causing damage  <cit> . dna lesions are produced when ros escape detoxification and react with, either dna, or nucleotide pools to produce oxidized bases or sugars. the potential mutagenic effects of oxidized dna bases are minimized by the dna repair enzymes  <cit> . these dna repair enzymes include the mutm/fpg, ogg <dig>  nth, and nei families of glycosylase enzymes that remove oxidized bases from dna. this group also includes the muty family which removes a residues that are frequently incorporated opposite the most predominant oxidative lesion, 8-oxoguanine , during replication  <cit> . a third class of antimutagenic enzymes are the mutt family proteins, which react with oxidized dna nucleotide triphosphates, 8-oxog and 8-oxoa, converting them to monophosphates, thereby preventing their incorporation into dna during replication  <cit> .

imbalances between the normal cellular processes that produce ros and the mechanisms that prevent and repair oxidative dna damage can result in increased mutagenesis and cell death  <cit> . oxidative dna damage accumulates in cells when an imbalance occurs between ros production and detoxification. such an imbalance increases the level of ros and causes more dna lesions to be produced than can be processed by the repair enzymes. increases in oxidative dna damage can also occur as a result of exposure to exogenous oxidative agents such as ionizing radiation or oxidative chemicals, or a decrease in dna repair capacity.

the human oxr <dig> gene was found in a screen for oxidation resistance genes. it is highly conserved, as homologues are found in all sequenced eukaryotic species from yeast to humans  <cit> . oxr <dig> of yeast and humans is an oxidative and heat stress inducible gene whose product localizes to the mitochondria. when localized to mitochondria of yeast, human oxr <dig> can complement the peroxide sensitivity of the yeast oxr <dig> mutant indicating that human oxr <dig>  like its yeast homologue, can function to protect against oxidative dna damage produced by endogenous and exogenous oxidative agents  <cit> . in this report we characterize a second human gene, called ncoa <dig>  which is highly similar to oxr <dig>  we test its ability to prevent oxidative mutagenesis when expressed in an oxidation dependent mutator strain of escherichia coli and compare the expression and localization of ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig> in human cells.

RESULTS
isolation of ncoa <dig> and its oxr <dig> domain
the ncoa <dig> gene was found in two ways:  by searches for estrogen receptor associated protein  <cit> , and  by genome searches using the oxr <dig> protein sequence as a computer probe to search the human genome for dna sequences potentially capable of encoding oxr <dig> paralogs  <cit> . the database searches resulted in the identification of four such regions; oxr <dig> itself, which is located on chromosome  8q <dig> and an apparent pseudogene on chr  <dig>  <cit> . two additional regions were found that had the structures consistent with functional genes. one is now called ncoa <dig> and is located on chr 6q <dig>  and a less conserved gene, tentatively named oxr <dig>  is located on chr 20q <dig>  analysis of expressed sequence tag  databases revealed a large collection of ests corresponding to oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig>  suggesting these two genes were expressed. oxr <dig> was found to correspond to only one est suggesting it is expressed, either rarely, conditionally, or not at all. thus we focused this study on the analysis of ncoa <dig> and compare its properties with those of oxr <dig> 

ncoa <dig> can protect cells from oxidative dna damage
in order to determine if the highly conserved oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig> are also functionally related, we performed experiments similar to those that led to the isolation of oxr <dig> and demonstration of its ability to protect cells from oxidative dna damage  <cit> . the protection of cells from oxidative dna damage by human oxr <dig> was most clearly demonstrated using an mutm muty mutant strain of e. coli. the combination of these two mutations causes a synergistic increase in gc→ta transversion mutagenesis due to the bacterial cell's inability to prevent mutagenesis by 8-oxoguanine , the predominant oxidative dna lesion  <cit> . mutm is required for the removal of 8-oxog and muty is required for the removal of a mispaired with 8-oxog, the predominant replication intermediate leading to mutagenesis by 8-oxog. since 8-oxog lesions result in gc→ta transversion, the level of oxidative dna damage can be monitored using the lacz cc <dig> allele. this allele reverts to lac+ only by gc→ta transversion  <cit>  and this transversion is produced primarily as a result of lesions repairable by the e. coli mutm 8-oxog dna glycosylase enzyme  <cit> . 8-oxog lesions result from the spontaneous production of ros as a by-product of normal aerobic metabolism, which in turn reacts with dna, producing lesions that give rise to mutations. the cells inability to repair the lesions, or to remove a mispaired with 8-oxog results in a mutator phenotype .

since expression of the human oxr <dig> cdna in the mutm muty mutator strain of e. coli results in suppression of spontaneous oxidative gc→ta transversion mutagenesis  <cit> , we tested if expression of ncoa <dig> produces a similar antimutator activity. the full length ncoa <dig> cdna was transferred to the ptrc99a vector and introduced into the mutm muty strain. figure 2c shows that this clone essentially abolishes spontaneous oxidative mutagenesis. this indicates that the full length ncoa <dig> protein functions to protect cells against oxidative dna damage when expressed in e. coli. quantitative mutagenesis assays confirm the ability of full length ncoa <dig> to suppress gc→ta transversion mutagenesis and demonstrate that oxidative mutagenesis is reduced by more than  <dig> %, which is similar to the spontaneous levels of mutagenesis seen in a wild type, repair proficient strain of e. coli .

in the case of the oxr <dig>  expression of the short oxr1c isoform, shown in black in figure  <dig>  is sufficient for its antimutator function in the bacterial assay  <cit> . to test if the oxidation resistance activity of ncoa <dig> coding sequences also lie in the corresponding region we constructed clones that lacked upstream regions and produced truncated ncoa <dig> proteins similar to oxr1c. the ncoa <dig>  clone begins at amino acid residue  <dig> of ncoa <dig> and extends to its normal termination codon  <cit> . expression of this clone reduces the oxidative mutator phenotype by 73% when expressed the e. coli mutm muty mutant strain . to test if the weak activity of the truncated protein is due to lower levels of expression, or instability of the protein, we pulse labeled total cellular proteins of iptg induced and uninduced cells with 35s-methionine, prepared extracts at various times after labeling and separated the proteins on 12% polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis, then scanned for iptg inducible bands of the expected molecular weights immediately after labeling and after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of further incubation. the full length ncoa <dig> protein was readily apparent as a strong band migrating at the expected molecular weight of  <dig> kda, based on the primary amino acid sequence. it appears to be relatively stable, showing no detectable diminution in intensity upon further incubation . the 657– <dig> fragment is seen as a faint band at its expected molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda . it appears to be relatively unstable, since it is weakly detectable only at the initial time point immediately after the  <dig> min chase with cold methionine, and is no longer detectable after  <dig> and  <dig> min further incubation . thus the weak activity of the 657– <dig> fragment in the mutagenesis assay is most likely due to its apparent instability. despite the low level of expression of the c-terminal domain compared to the full length protein, the truncated protein is still capable of suppressing 73% of the oxidative mutagenesis. thus we propose that c-terminal domain of ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig> proteins defines the oxr domain that protects cells from oxidative mutagenesis.

ncoa <dig> is localized to the nucleus
protein sequence analysis of ncoa <dig> indicated that it has a putative nuclear localization signal. in order to determine if this sequence does in fact direct the protein to the nucleus, we produced a flag tagged form of ncoa <dig> and expressed it in mcf- <dig> cells by transient transfection. ncoa <dig> was originally identified as an estrogen receptor-associated protein. to examine whether its cellular localization may be affected by estrogen stimulation, cells were grown in the absence of hormone and then treated with  <dig> nm  <dig> β-estradiol  for  <dig> hrs. figure  <dig> shows that in the absence of hormone, ncoa <dig> exhibits a localization that is both cytoplasmic and nuclear. the cytoplasmic localization of ncoa <dig> differs from that of oxr <dig>  which shows a punctate pattern of staining that colocalizes with the mitochondrial marker mitotracker indicating its mitochondrial localization  <cit> . while we can not rule out the possibility that ncoa <dig> is present in mitochondria, it differs from oxr <dig> and is clearly not concentrated in this organelle. therefore oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig> show different localization properties. oxr <dig> is excluded from nuclei and localizes to mitochondria, whereas ncoa <dig> shows diffuse cytoplasmic staining and localizes to nuclei . upon treatment of cells with estradiol , ncoa <dig> is concentrated in the nucleus and cytoplasmic staining appears to be reduced. thus the treatment with e <dig> appears to stimulate nuclear localization.

ncoa <dig> is not induced by peroxide treatment
oxr <dig> and many other proteins that protect against oxidative dna damage are inducible upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . in order to determine if ncoa <dig> is induced in response to peroxide treatments, mcf- <dig> cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, proteins extracted at various times post treatment. ncoa <dig> levels were then measured by western blot. figure  <dig> shows that only the  <dig> kda band is reduced by ncoa <dig> specific sirna treatments, indicating that this is the ncoa <dig> band. examination of peroxide treated cells shows that the levels of ncoa <dig> protein are not detectably altered in response to treatment. thus we conclude that ncoa <dig> is constitutively expressed and is not induced by peroxide treatment, differing in this respect from oxr <dig> 

discussion
comparisons of the oxr gene family indicate several key events have occurred during evolution of oxr domain proteins. s. cerevisiae carries only one copy of oxr in its genome. it is  <dig> amino acids in length and includes only sequences corresponding to the c-terminal oxr domains of ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig>  in higher organisms, the oxr domain has become associated with additional upstream protein coding sequences. this occurred prior to duplication, since there is a high degree of identity and similarity between ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig> throughout their sequences. the exceptions to this are their n termini, which, in ncoa <dig> contains a nuclear localization sequence, which is absent in the mitochondrially targeted oxr <dig>  portions of their largest central exons are also dissimilar. in ncoa <dig> its exon  <dig> is  <dig> amino acids in length and contains its estrogen receptor binding site  <cit> , whereas the corresponding exon  <dig> of oxr <dig> is only  <dig> amino acids in length and lacks the estrogen receptor binding sequences. oxr <dig> also contains several unique exons. these include exon  <dig>  which has a readily recognizable mitochondrial targeting sequence  <cit> , and exon  <dig>  which is found in only one oxr <dig> isoform .

the demonstration that the full length ncoa <dig> protein can function to prevent oxidative mutagenesis when expressed in bacteria suggests it may function in this manner in its native eukaryotic host. in bacteria, this may be a general function that results in detoxification of various ros molecules. the key role for the c-terminal oxr domains in oxidation resistance is indicated by  the oxidation sensitivity resulting from deletion of the oxr <dig> gene of yeast  <cit> ;  the ability of mitochondrially targeted human oxr domain of oxr <dig> to complement the h2o <dig> sensitivity of the yeast oxr <dig> deletion mutant  <cit> ; and  the ability of the oxr domains of either oxr <dig> or ncoa <dig> to suppress the oxidative mutator phenotype of oxidation sensitive e. coli mutants  <cit>  . thus we refer to the c-terminal region of ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig> as the oxidation resistance, or oxr domain. comparison of the oxr domains of oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig> with the yeast gene product, indicates both human genes are approximately equally similar to the yeast protein when their oxr domains are compared with the full length yeast protein; oxr <dig> has 27%identity and 44% similarity to yeast oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig> has 31% identity and 43% similarity. although both human genes are equally similar to the single s. cerevisiae oxr gene, the yeast oxr gene is functionally most similar to human oxr <dig>  since both yeast and human oxr <dig> proteins are induced by hydrogen peroxide and heat stress, and localize to mitochondria  <cit> .

the association of the ncoa <dig> gene product with the estrogen receptor is curious for a gene product involved in protection from oxidative dna damage. it is noteworthy that several dna repair proteins have recently been identified as estrogen receptor associated proteins. these include the o6-methylguanine methyltransferase dna repair protein, the 3-methyladenine dna n-glycosylase repair protein, and the tg specific mismatch repair protein tdg  <cit> . the result that ncoa <dig> is another er associated protein that has dna maintenance properties, suggests that er association of these related classes of proteins may be a common feature. it has been proposed that ncoa <dig> may sense the oxidative state of the cell and regulate responses to oxidative dna damage and the result that ncoa <dig> can function to protect cells from oxidative dna damage strengthens this hypothesis  <cit> . it may also play a direct role in oxidation resistance, a possibility that is particularly intriguing in light of results indicating that estrogen metabolism causes oxidative dna damage . when estrogens, such as β-estradiol, are metabolized to catechol estrogen quinones and semiquinones, they enter into a redox cycling reaction in which the quinones are reduced to semiquinones. the semiquinones, in turn, spontaneously oxidize to back to quinones producing ros  <cit> . oxidative dna damage has been demonstrated to result as a by-product of estradiol metabolism  <cit> , thus it is possible that ncoa <dig> functions to mitigate oxidative dna damage resulting from estrogen metabolism by bringing it in close proximity to estrogens upon import into the nucleus. moreover, such an oxidation resistance mechanism of ncoa <dig> should be enhanced by the presence of estrogen, since this stimulates ncoa <dig> entry into the nucleus .

both ncoa <dig> and oxr <dig> gene products show their highest levels of expression in brain tissue  <cit> , suggesting they may play a critical role in protecting brain cells from oxidative dna damage. thus, it will be of interest to see if either or both of these proteins function to protect against neurodegenerative diseases that are affected by oxidative damage and apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
the ncoa <dig> gene produces a product that is similar to oxr <dig> in sequence and in function. it is able to increase resistance to prevent oxidative mutagenesis when expressed in bacteria. this function requires only its c-terminal oxr domain, which is conserved from yeast to human cells. ncoa <dig> differs from oxr <dig> in several key respects, unlike the mitochondrial and inducible oxr <dig> gene product, the ncoa <dig> gene product localizes to the nucleus and is associated with the estrogen receptor. thus, these two oxidation resistance proteins appear to have different and unique roles. yeast carries only a small oxr1-like protein that is similar to the oxr domains of both oxr <dig> and ncoa <dig>  but is functionally most similar to mammalian oxr <dig>  in higher eukaryotes the two oxr domain genes appear to have arisen by duplication of an ancestral oxr gene after acquiring a common upstream sequence.
