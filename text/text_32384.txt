BACKGROUND
il- <dig> has a major impact in the modulation of cellular immune response mechanisms. the heterodimeric cytokine enhances the proliferation and activation of natural killer cells  and the maturation of activated t lymphocytes to type  <dig> t helper cells  and cytotoxic t lymphocytes   <cit>  unveiling its potential for the treatment of infectious  <cit>  and malignant diseases  <cit> . induction of a cellular antitumoral immune response is directed not only against the primary lesion but also against distant organ metastases opening therapeutic options for those patients considered incurable at the present time. tumor regression at the treatment site as well as in distant organ metastases was illustrated in  <dig> utilizing a gene gun technique to incorporate plasmid dna into intradermal tumors in mice  <cit> . in this particular tumor model il- <dig> resulted in a superior antitumoral immune response and lasting systemic antitumoral immunity as compared with a variety of other cytokines . il-12-mediated antitumoral immune response was also illustrated in a variety of different murine tumor models  <cit> .

systemic application of recombinant il- <dig> resulted in a broad and undirected stimulation of the cellular immune system lacking antitumoral efficacy. toxicity was mainly contributed by the induction of interferon-γ with anti-ifn-γ antibodies abolishing the lethal effect of systemic administration of recombinant il- <dig> in mice  <cit> . interferon-γ induction also contributes in part to the induction of a cellular antitumoral immune response since anti-ifn-γ antibodies diminish systemic antitumoral immunity  <cit> . nevertheless, studies with ifn-γ receptor-knockout mice suggested an interferon-γ independent pathway of il-12-mediated antitumoral immunity  <cit> .

in humans the maximum tolerable dose  of il- <dig> was determined to be  <dig>  μg/kg body weight after intravenous administration  <cit>  with reversion of advanced cancer associated defects in t-lymphocytes and nk cells  <cit> . remarkably mtd was slightly lower after subcutaneous administration  <cit> . repeated administration of il- <dig> resulted in an increasing tolerance   <cit>  which was in part due to increased stat- <dig>  degradation.

in a phase ii clinical trial repeated intravenous administration of recombinant il- <dig> within less than  <dig> days resulted in leucopenia , hyperbilirubinemia , elevation of transaminases , dyspnoa  and lassitude  with two fatalities due to hypovolemic shock caused by hemorrhagic colitis and sepsis  <cit> .

in hodgkin's lymphoma repeated intravenous or subcutaneous administration of recombinant il- <dig> resulted in a 21% response rate with partial  and complete regression   <cit> . repeated local administration of rhil <dig> in patients with t-cell lymphoma lead to an infiltration of the tumor tissue with inflammatory cells resulting in pr or cr in 50% of all cases  <cit> . il- <dig> in patients with melanoma produced similar response rates  <cit> . however, results in renal cell and ovarian carcinoma were rather disappointing  <cit> . colombo described in  <dig> that the concentration of il- <dig> at the tumor site might be crucial for the establishment of systemic antitumoral immunity  <cit> .

with the development of vector systems, lasting as well as local expression of therapeutic genes have become feasible. consequently, murine cancer cells either modified by il- <dig> encoding plasmids or retrovirally transduced ex vivo  <cit>  were able to immunize against the native cancer cell line and to protect against the tumor cells in consecutive challenge experiments. even though direct intratumoral injection of il- <dig> encoding plasmids resulted in significant immune response in different animal models  <cit> , antitumoral response in a clinical trial remained marginal with no cure or long term immunity  <cit> . poor transduction efficacy of plasmid vectors was overcome by the use of adenoviral vectors. intratumoral injection of il- <dig> encoding recombinant adenoviral vectors in mice resulted in a specific immunity against breast cancer and colon cancer  <cit> . adoptive immunotransfer illustrated t-cell mediated, long term systemic immunity  <cit> .

gene therapeutic approaches utilizing the coexpression of both subunits for the generation of bioactive il- <dig> were compromised by the formation of inhibitory p <dig> homodimers. this interference was prevented by the introduction of il- <dig> fusion genes  <cit> . the potential of these constructs integrated in adenoviral expression systems for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors was illustrated recently  <cit> .

considering the potential toxicity related to the expression of il- <dig> and the necessity of high intratumoral concentrations, the scope of this study was to construct an adenoviral vector for highly efficient and regulated expression of a human single-chain il- <dig>  a modified e. coli operator system was utilized for tetracycline suppressible expression. high gene expression was enabled by the use of a vp <dig> herpes simplex virus transactivator fused to the e. coli tet-repressor. positioning of the trans-activating fusion protein was realized by tet-operator upstream of the gene of interest  <cit> . this system was further enhanced by integration of a bidirectional promoter also expressing the transactivator in the absence of doxycycline  <cit> . in the presence of low concentrations of doxycycline the fusion protein immediately dissociates from the tet-operator thru binding of doxycycline to the tet-repressor domain with drastic reduction of vp <dig> mediated gene expression.

RESULTS
construction of suppressible vectors for the expression of human il-12
the adenoviral expression plasmid pad.3r-hscil- <dig> was constructed as described, and corresponding recombinant e1/e <dig> deleted adenoviral vectors were generated by calcium phosphate mediated cotransfection with pbhg <dig> in 293-cells . plaques were purified and the adenovirus was amplified in 293-cells. the adenoviral titer was determined utilizing standard plaque assay procedures.

dox-dependent expression of human single-chain il-12
we were able to illustrate the high adenoviral transduction efficacy in ht <dig> human colon cancer cells in previous publications  <cit> . these cells were infected with ad.3r-hscil <dig> at an m.o.i. of  <dig> followed by incubation for  <dig> hours at various concentrations of doxycycline. human single-chain il- <dig> was then determined in the cell lysate and the cell free culture supernatant. substantial suppression was obtained at doxycycline concentrations as low as  <dig> ng/ml with maximum suppression levels of 2200-fold for il- <dig> in the supernatant and 5000-fold in the cell lysate at  <dig> ng/ml doxycycline . in the absence of dox, infection at an m.o.i. of  <dig> resulted in 2% il- <dig> in relation to total soluble cellular protein .

western blot analysis revealed significant suppression of tetr as detected with a tetr monoclonal antibody  <cit> , illustrating down regulation of the transactivator proportional to the suppression of il- <dig> expression in the presence of doxycycline .

comparison of bioactivity
bioactivity of adenovirally-expressed human single-chain il- <dig> was compared with purified heterodimeric p40/p <dig> standard in order to estimate the biological response in a clinical setting. bioactivity was first evaluated by ifn-γ induction in human mononuclear cells after conditioning with cd3- and cd28- antibodies. pretreated mnc were then incubated with hscil- <dig> from the supernatant of adenovirally infected ht <dig> cells or with equivalent concentrations of a human heterodimeric il- <dig> who-standard. twenty-four hours after incubation at 37°c, expressed human interferon-γ was quantified by elisa . bioactivity profiles did not reveal a significant difference. interferon-γ induction was observed at il- <dig> concentrations as low as  <dig> pg/ml with maximum induction at  <dig> ng/ml. ed <dig> was estimated to be  <dig> –  <dig> pg/ml il- <dig> resulting in the induction of interferon-γ at  <dig> pg/ml. basal induction of interferon-γ in the absence of il- <dig> was  <dig> pg/ml, mainly due to prestimulation of mnc with cd3- and cd28-antibodies.

to further delineate whether the ifn-γ production was induced by il- <dig>  pre-stimulated mnc were incubated with a) native medium, b) heterodimeric il- <dig>  or c) viral il- <dig> for  <dig> hours and brefeldin a for  <dig> hours to prevent the release of intracellular proteins including ifn-γ. the mnc were subsequently labeled by surface staining with fluorochrome-conjugated mab's detecting cd3-apc/cd <dig> and cd <dig> followed by intracellular labeling with an anti-ifn-γ -fitc mab and analyzed by flow cytometry. recently activated t4- and t8-cells as defined by the expression of cd <dig> were analyzed for their ifn-γ producing profile. a representative ifn-γ expression analysis is shown in figure 5a.

basal production of ifn-γ was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . incubation with standardized heterodimeric human il- <dig> resulted in  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  activation, incubation with adenovirally produced human single-chain il- <dig> resulted in  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  production of ifn-γ. both il- <dig> preparations resulted in highly significant activation of cd4+ and cd8+ cells  with no significant difference in between heterodimeric il- <dig> and single-chain il- <dig>  concluding equal bioactivity for both cytokines .

coxsackie-adenovirus receptor expression and adenoviral transduction in human colon cancer
demonstrating high adenoviral transduction efficiency in a variety of human colon cancer cell lines  <cit> , the question remained whether native human cancer tissue shows equal susceptibility towards adenoviral infection. since adenoviral infection is mainly mediated by the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor , human colon and colon cancer tissues were stained for car expression. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  normal colon epithelium as well as human colon cancer cells revealed high expression of the car using a monoclonal car-antibody and apaap staining with no expression in the adjacent tissue. staining applying a detection system based on horseradish peroxidase resulted in identical distribution . figure  <dig> illustrates transgene expression after infection of human colon cancer specimens with doxycycline suppressible adenoviral vectors. luciferase and human il- <dig> were significantly expressed in human colon cancer tissue in the absence of doxycycline. addition of dox at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml resulted in a 1200-fold suppression for non-secreted luciferase and 9700-fold suppression for secreted single-chain human il- <dig> 

discussion
recent clinical trials utilizing recombinant il- <dig> in the experimental treatment of human cancer illustrate the potential hazards of these approaches. severe side effects such as hemorrhagic colitis and sepsis indicate the unacceptable risk associated with systemic and repeated administration of recombinant il- <dig> in the treatment of cancer  <cit> . local application is limited by the short half-life of the cytokine and showed some efficacy only in a sparse number of tumor entities. therefore, local expression of an il- <dig> gene is a promising approach to avoid such problems. vector systems for the expression of human il- <dig> did not result in significant clinical response yet, which is most likely due to weak transgene expression.

we were able to construct adenoviral vectors addressing these issues by incorporation of a highly potent and doxycycline-regulated transactivator for the expression of human single-chain il- <dig>  infection of human colon cancer cells  at an m.o.i. of  <dig> resulted in the expression of  <dig> ng/ <dig> cells in  <dig> h. to our knowledge, these expression levels exceed any adenoviral vectors expressing human il- <dig> as well as stably transduced cell lines published so far. doxycycline concentrations as low as  <dig> ng/ml resulted in suppression levels of up to 5000-fold. with peak concentrations of  <dig>  μg/ml  <dig> hours after oral application of  <dig> mg doxycycline and average serum levels of  <dig>  μg/ml after  <dig> mg doxycycline daily  <cit> , suitable concentrations of doxycycline are quickly obtainable for efficient and timely suppression of transgene expression. addition of doxycycline to the drinking water completely abolished the otherwise lethal effect of these systemically administered murine il- <dig> expressing vectors in mice .

interferon-γ induction in human mononuclear cells after incubation with adenovirally expressed human single-chain il- <dig> did not differ from induction with purified p35/p <dig> heterodimer at various concentrations. these results together with the comparative facs analysis show similar bioactivity. inhibition of bioactivity through the formation of p <dig> homodimers was avoided by expressing a il- <dig> fusion protein rather than the separate subunits e.g. by utilizing an internal ribosome entry site  <cit> . furthermore, the human single-chain il- <dig> contains a secretory leader domain, resulting in efficient secretion independent of posttranslational processing and p <dig> subunit glycosylation  <cit> .

adenoviral transduction of human tissue requires the expression of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor  with vector internalization depending on alphavbeta3- and alphavbeta5-integrins. expression of the car was shown in human colon epithelium as well as colon cancer illustrating the feasibility of adenoviral transduction and adenovirally mediated transgene expression. adenoviral infection of freshly derived human colon cancer biopsies with 3* <dig> p.f.u. demonstrated efficient ex vivo transgene expression as well as highly significant doxycycline-mediated suppression in tumor tissue. colon cancer differentiation dependent car expression and consecutive transgene expression remain to be determined and is currently under investigation.

these data further support the use of doxycycline-suppressible, highly efficient adenoviral vector systems for the treatment of human cancer. vector related toxicity could probably be avoided by applying a significantly lower viral dose since transgene expression within these new promoter systems was shown to be more than 4000-fold higher as compared with the cmv-promoter commonly used in clinical trials. tumor regression and systemic immunity after high intratumoral human il- <dig> expression have to be addressed in a clinical setting. even though oral administration of doxycycline can dramatically reduce il- <dig> expression and related toxicity in mice, doxycycline mediated suppression of il- <dig> expression in humans remains to be investigated. serum half life of recombinant human il- <dig> was determined to be  <dig> to  <dig> hours  <cit> , thus possibly requiring additional precautions such as the temporary application of neutralizing anti il- <dig> or interferon-γ antibodies in order to inactivate circulating cytokines.

CONCLUSIONS
with expression levels exceeding the widely used viral cmv-promoter, combined with tight regulation of gene expression by low concentrations of doxycycline, we are confident that these adenoviral vectors will add to the feasibility and safety in the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer as well as other malignancies.
