BACKGROUND
with the sequencing of the human genome completed and with mrna/cdna identification rapidly progressing, many potential novel genes have been discovered and attention has turned to the function and structure of the predicted proteins  <cit> . in order to study these novel gene products, sufficient amounts of protein generally obtained through recombinant protein expression are required. the  expression and characterisation of unknown and poorly characterised human proteins is a main objective of recombinant proteomic studies today.

escherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic expression system for the high-level production of recombinant proteins in vivo  <cit>  and has already been used successfully in high-throughput protein expression and purification studies  <cit> . the use of e. coli has many advantages, including the ease of growth and manipulation of the organism and the availability of many different vectors and host strains that have been developed over the years. however, the use of e. coli also has limitations, such as the aggregation of protein in insoluble inclusion bodies, problems with the expression of gene products toxic to the physiology of the host cell or proteolytic degradation of proteins in the cytoplasm  <cit> . in light of these difficulties, cell-free expression systems are becoming increasingly popular  <cit> . the in vitro systems have several advantages, including rapid protein synthesis  <cit> , the possibility to express toxic gene products  <cit>  and constructs that otherwise would be proteolytically degraded. furthermore, it is possible to express proteins with up to  <dig> putative transmembrane domains as reported recently  <cit> . the compatibility with pcr-generated templates as well as plasmids allows the in vitro expression reaction with e. coli extract to be optimised using silent mutations within pcr products  <cit> . these sequence optimisations reduce unfavourable secondary structures in mrna and thus improve the success rate of translation and protein expression. in contrast, for cell-free protein expression with wheat germ lysate sequence optimisation is not necessary because of the eukaryotic nature of this source.

for protein expression analyses, a comprehensive cdna collection is available at the german ressource center . the full-length open reading frames  are cloned into an entry vector by utilizing the gatewayÂ® cloning technology . untranslated regions are excluded and only the open reading frame is cloned into the selected vector, either with or without a stop codon. for protein expression, the open reading frame can be moved into any desired expression vector by homologous recombination. thus, a protein can be expressed with or without a tag and the tag itself can easily be selected and altered by choosing the appropriate destination vector.

the aim of this study was to evaluate alternatives to protein expression in e.coli in vivo especially for those orfs yielding no protein in this system. therefore we investigated protein expression in two different in vitro systems: e. coli and wheat germ extract. the performance of these systems was analysed and optimised in respect to expression rate, protein yield and solubility. altogether, we tested the expression of  <dig> human full-length proteins in vivo and in vitro using standardised conditions.

RESULTS
comparison of in vivo and in vitro escherichia coli expressions
we used  <dig> randomly selected fully sequence-verified human open reading frames with a broad range of expected molecular weights , different predicted subcellular localisations and biochemical functions including membrane proteins. the orfs were cloned into an expression vector , for production of proteins with an n-terminal 6xhis-tag. identical constructs were used for protein expression in vitro and also for transformation of bacteria and expression in vivo. protein expression was analysed by western blotting using an anti-his antibody.

in e. coli in vivo  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins, and in vitro  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins were successfully expressed. protein expression in bacteria was unsuccessful either because clones were generated, which did not show protein expression  or the transformation failed completely . considering the overlap of both expression systems,  <dig> full open reading frames yielded no protein product in vivo andin vitro. in contrast,  <dig> targets were expressed in vivo andin vitro with an average molecular weight of  <dig> kda. among these,  <dig> clones showed an expression rate of  <dig>   <dig> clones of  <dig> and  <dig> clones of  <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> targets expressed in either system with an average moleclar weight of  <dig> kda.

optimisation of e. coli expression in vitro
we next examined the effect of sequence optimisation on protein expression rate and protein yield by selecting randomly  <dig> out of the  <dig> orfs  where protein expression had been unsuccessful in vivo or where transformation had failed in bl21plyss. three kinds of linear pcr templates were generated :  a c-terminal wild type with c-terminal 6xhis-tag  a c-terminal mutant with c-terminal 6xhis-tag and inserted silent mutation at the n-terminus  a n-terminal wild type with n-terminal 6xhis-tag and no attachment sites ; for the c- and n-terminal wild type template the orf is identical to the original orf in the plasmid dna.

influence of sequence optimisation on protein expression rate
of these  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples  were successfully expressed in vitro using the original plasmid dna. after sequence optimisation, we increased the success rate of protein expression up to  <dig> samples  in the cell-free e. coli system .

when analysing the results of those samples which had previously not shown expression in vitro , we found that following sequence optimisation  <dig>  proteins were expressed.

influence of sequence optimisation on protein yield
to assess the protein expression yield of pcr products after sequence optimisation, we evaluated  <dig> samples that had previously expressed protein in vitro from original plasmid dna. protein yield was determined by analysis of protein bands on western blots. bands were given marks from  <dig>  to  <dig> . here, we discovered that 65% of expressions  showed an improvement in the protein yield compared to expressions using original plasmid dna and another 19% showed similar protein yields. a smaller amount of protein was expressed in only  <dig> cases  using the optimised pcr products. among these were  <dig> samples which did not express protein at all. in summary, after analysis of  <dig> expressions in vitro with optimised pcr-products,  <dig> samples  revealed no protein product in vivo or in vitro in the e. coli systems .

wheat germ expression in vitro
the aim of this experiment was to elucidate whether the wheat germ system would show an increase in the success rate and protein yield of the  <dig> selected open reading frames compared to the optimised in vitro expressions in e. coli. two wild type pcr constructs were made for each open reading frame, one for production of a protein with a c-terminal 6xhis-tag and another for a protein with a n-terminal 6xhis-tag . a total of  <dig> proteins could be expressed in wheat germ lysate with either a c- or a n-terminal 6xhis-tag . out of the  <dig> open reading frames which were not expressed in the e. coli systems,  <dig> were now successfully expressed using wheat germ lysate . however,  <dig> open reading frames did not express in the wheat germ system, but were previously successfully expressed in vitro in e. coli . on average, based on western blotting analyses, the protein yield was higher in the wheat germ compared to expressions in the e. coli in vitro system, for identical human orfs.

influence of tag position on protein expression in vitro
to assess the influence of either n- or c-terminal tag positions on expression rate, the  <dig> open reading frames were evaluated in both in vitro expression systems, e. coli and wheat germ . in the e. coli in vitro system, protein expressions using optimised pcr products were evaluated. here,  <dig>  n-terminal tagged wild type pcr products expressed protein compared to only  <dig>  with c-terminal wild type pcr products . with the c-terminal mutant product  <dig>  proteins were expressed. in the wheat germ system,  <dig> were expressed using the n-terminal wild type construct  and  <dig> with the c-terminal tag  .

in summary,  <dig> out of  <dig> open reading frames were expressed in both in vitro systems, corresponding to a success rate of 93%. only  <dig> orfs yielded no protein in any of the systems tested .

comparison of solubility of proteins expressed in e. coli in vivo, in vitro and in wheat germ system
for solubility studies, the lysis supernatant of those targets revealing expression was analysed by western blot.  <dig> proteins, expressed in e. coli in vivo, were tested and  <dig> proteins were soluble . for e. coli expressions in vitro ,  <dig> were analysed and  <dig> proteins were soluble . in the wheat germ system with a c-terminal 6xhis-tag  <dig> of the  <dig>  expressing pcr products showed soluble protein and 95% with an n-terminal 6xhis-tag.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
with this approach we evaluated the performance of three different protein expression systems in vivo and in vitro with a set of  <dig> full-length open reading frames. for our investigations of protein synthesis we chose escherichia coli bacteria as it is one of the most common and easy to use systems. for cell-free in vitro expression, we compared the e. coli with the wheat germ protocol.

first, we analysed the protein expression rate in the two e. coli systems  and found that expression is higher in the in vivo system . regarding the success rate of both protocols, only 22% of plasmids yielded no protein.

we then focused on a subset of  <dig> targets which had yielded no protein in e. coli in vivo. these targets expressed with the cell-free wheat germ and e. coli protocol yielded very different protein expression rates. in wheat germ 86% of the targets were expressed and in cell-free e. coli only 43%. one of the reasons for unsuccessful in vitro protein expression in e. coli may be the presence of secondary structures in mrna, which may inhibit translation  <cit> . to solve this problem, we made use of the proteoexpert software, which predicts possible sequence-related problems and proposes optimised sequences with potentially reduced unfavourable secondary structures  <cit> . out of the  <dig> proteins that were not expressed in e. coli in vivo,  <dig> were expressed in vitro using the wild type sequence. another set of  <dig> human proteins could be rescued by sequence optimisation and using linear templates for in vitro expression. therefore, the overall success rate of in vivo negative clones was 85%. this result clearly demonstrates that sequence optimisation is necessary to improve protein synthesis in the e. coli in vitro system.

furthermore, we analysed the influence of tag position on protein expression rate. we found no difference between c- or n-terminal tag in the wheat germ system. however, considering the cell-free e. coli system, 60% successful expression was obtained with the n-terminal wild type pcr product in contrast to only 34% with the c-terminal one. in this context it is important to realize that this 60% expression with the n-terminal tag matches with the 59% obtained with the c-terminal mutant. obviously, modifying the sequence by adding a sequence optimised peptide tag also avoids expression problems associated with the inition of translation.

after analysis of the  <dig> optimised expressions in vitro,  <dig> samples remained that were not expressed in vivo or in vitro . this corresponds to a protein expression success rate of 93%. regarding those proteins, which could not be expressed in either system, it is striking that the molecular mass of all of these targets is higher than  <dig> kda with an average molecular weight of  <dig> kda. two membrane associated proteins belong to the unsuccessful targets: pnpla <dig>  and slc40a <dig> , the latter with more than  <dig> transmembrane domains. furthermore, a dna binding protein kif <dig>  of the kinesin family, involved in spindle formation, elac <dig>  an endonuclease, ttll <dig> , a tubulin tyrosin ligase-like protein and kiaa <dig> , a hypothetical protein with one transmembrane domain, are among the non-expressing targets. at this point it is unclear whether these human proteins are functionally expressed in any of the systems. therefore, we can not speculate about the interference between the protein function and the different expression systems.

however,  <dig> proteins with an average molecular weight of  <dig> kda were expressed in e. coli in vitro but not in wheat germ. among these proteins is hmox <dig> which belongs to the heme oxygenase family, an iron-containing protein with one transmembrane domain. as reported recently, iron-containing proteins require supplemented iron sources which were not added in this case  <cit> . further proteins are two with transmembrane domains . the three proteins racgap <dig>  flj <dig> and hspc <dig> each contain one coiled coil domain and have molecular weights higher than  <dig> kda. obviously, the expression of proteins with molecular weights higher than  <dig> kda are critical for the wheat germ system  <cit> .

ten proteins with an average molecular weight of  <dig> kda also remain which were expressed in wheat germ but not in e. coli in vitro. an explanation for this can not be found in the structural domains, because a coiled coil and one transmembrane domain were not a hindrance for expression of the proteins mentioned before. also the molecular weight is not the problem. regarding the function of these proteins, supt7l , eif2s <dig>  and rpl23a  are proteins which interfere with dna or rna. it seems that those proteins are likely to have negative effects on their recombinant expression, when functional active in e.coli cells. also proteins influencing the cell cycle like dap , kiaa <dig> , pak <dig> , gpsm <dig>  and os- <dig>  seem to hamper recombinant protein expression.

based on western blotting analyses, the protein yield in wheat germ was higher compared to expressions in the e. coli in vitro. this may be due to the fact that the in vitro e. coli expression system is a batch method for protein expression, whereas the wheat germ system is based on a two-compartment system. the two chambers are separated by a semi-permeable membrane which concentrates the expressed protein in the  <dig> Î¼l reaction chamber, but lets compounds required for protein synthesis such as substrates and energy components pass through into the larger feeding chamber. at the same time, potentially inhibitory by-products are diluted via diffusion across the membrane. the wheat germ system showed the highest rate of success compared to expression in e. coli in vitro or in vivo. thus, for in vitro protein expression, specifically for toxic proteins which can not be expressed in bacteria, the wheat germ system is the method of choice.

comparing protein solubility in e. coli bacteria and the cell-free e. coli and wheat germ systems, we found that the wheat germ system produces the highest solubility rate . this was also reported previously  <cit> . it should be mentioned that our experimental procedure does not exclude the formation of protein aggregates. moreover, the data show that the proteins expressed in vitro are more likely to be soluble than those expressed in vivo. however, even though the e. coli in vivo expressions showed, in a first approach, a higher success rate than in vitro, the in vitro system does have advantages. protein expression is very fast and can be accomplished within a few hours. the expression of toxic gene products allows proteins to be expressed, which are impossible to express in bacteria. also the use of pcr products is possible, and no clones are necessary for protein expression. however, linear dna needs to be protected during the in vitro reactions to suppress nuclease activity. in addition, proteins are also more likely to be soluble when expressed in any of the in vitro systems used compared to expression in bacteria.

in summary, we have demonstrated that cell-free protein expression leads to the desired full-length protein with an overall success rate of up to 93%. in our study, wheat germ expression using a two compartment system is the method of choice as it shows high solubility and high protein yield.
