BACKGROUND
daldinia spp. belonging to the phylum ascomycota and class sordariomycetes, are known as endophytes or latent pathogens which inhabit woody host plants and remain in a dormant phase until the decay of wood or formation of perithecial stromata  <cit> . the ascospores and conidia of these fungi are spread to neighboring trees via wind movements or fungivorous insects  <cit> . daldinia eschscholtzii has been isolated from dead trees  <cit> , marine alga  <cit> , insect  <cit>  and recently also from human specimens  <cit> , displaying the great adaptation ability of this organism in a diverse host range. to date, there is no extensive analysis of the d. eschscholtzii genome, although this fungal species has been shown to produce potential bioactive compounds.

secondary metabolites produced by d. eschscholtzii have potential medical and industrial applications. zhang et al.  <cit>  reported the isolation of immunosuppressive compounds, including dalesconol a, b and c, daeschol a,  <dig>  16-dihydroxyl-benzofluoranthene and dalmanol a, from mantis-associated d. eschscholtzii. helicascolide c, a new lactone with fungistatic activity against cladosporium cucumerinum was isolated together with helicascolide a from an indonesian marine algicolous-associated d. eschscholtzii  <cit> . daldinia spp. have been reported to produce volatile organic compounds   which can be developed in industrial applications for biofuel, biocontrol, and mycofumigation.

d. eschscholtzii has previously shown a typical feature of wood-decaying fungi, which is the production of enzymes for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass, such as endoglucanase and β-glucosidase  <cit> . as previously described, daldinia spp. are known as type ii soft-rot fungi that cause erosive degradation of lignocelluloses  <cit> ; one sp. d. concentrica has been shown to be able to degrade the recalcitrant non-phenolic structures of lignin  <cit> . this indicates that daldinia spp. may have the ability to convert lignocellulosic biomass into different value-added products including biofuel, chemicals, and cheap carbon sources for fermentation, improved animal feeds, and human nutrients.

in this study, we present the genome of d. eschscholtzii um  <dig>  an isolate obtained from human skin scraping, that enabled us to perform detailed analysis with the previously published genome of d. eschscholtzii um  <dig>  <cit>  for shared and common biological features. the genetic information of d. eschscholtzii um  <dig>  combined with that of d. eschscholtzii um  <dig>  will provide the knowledge for a deeper understanding of the biological nature of d. eschscholtzii.

RESULTS
morphological and molecular identification
um  <dig> and um  <dig> isolates  were grown on sabouraud dextrose agar  incubated at 30 °c for 6 days. both cultures initially appeared as whitish, azonate and felty colonies with diffuse margins, and later became smoky gray with slight olivaceous tones . the reverse side of culture plate appeared dark in color, indicating the growth of melanized hyphae . microscopic observation under the light microscope showed septate conidiophores mononematously or dichotomously branched with conidiogenous cells arising from the terminus. from the apical end of conidiogenous cells, conidia were produced holoblastically in sympodial sequence . the conidiophore was also observed to be branched from the conidiogenous area . the surface topology of conidiophores and conidia was examined under the scanning electron microscope . coarsely rough conidiophores, as well as ellipsoid-shaped rough conidia with a flattened base , were seen. these anamorphic features are similar to those of the daldinia spp. previously described by ju et al.  <cit> .fig.  <dig> morphological observations of the representative um isolate. a top view of culture on sda plate for 6 days at 30 °c. b black color from the reverse view of culture on sda plate, indicating the presence of melanized hyphae. c microscopic observation; the arrow shows the conidia produced in sympodial sequence. bar scale is 20 μm. d microscopic observation; the arrow shows the conidiophore branching from the conidiogenous area. bar scale is 20 μm. e scanning electron micrograph; the arrow shows the conidium with flattened base. bar scale is 1 μm. f scanning electron micrograph; the arrow shows the rough surface of conidiophore. bar scale is 2 μm

genome sequencing and assembly
the um  <dig> genome was sequenced with illumina genome analyzer iix as previously reported  <cit> . it was sequenced and assembled using a single 350 bp insert size genomic dna library that generated 123-fold coverage of illumina reads with a total genome size of  <dig>  mb . in this study, the um  <dig> genome was sequenced to 106-fold depth on illumina hiseq  <dig> and assembled using a combination of two different insert size  genomic dna libraries. in this genome assembly, we were able to gap close many small contigs and link them together into bigger scaffolds, especially in the repetitive sequence regions, by utilizing sequencing reads from the 5 kb insert size reads library. this assembly resulted in  <dig> scaffolds , a significant reduction from the  <dig> scaffolds in the um  <dig> assembly, but with  <dig> more contigs. the um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes  showed similar gc content  and the number of predicted coding genes .table  <dig> summary of the assembly and annotation features of daldinia eschscholtzii um  <dig> and um 1020

the completeness of genome assembly was assessed using the cegma  software that evaluates the presence and completeness of a widely conserved set of  <dig> core eukaryotic genes  <cit> . the standard cegma pipeline identified  <dig> out of the  <dig> core eukaryotic genes  in the um  <dig> genome assembly as complete, with an additional five core eukaryotic genes detected as partial . similarly, out of the  <dig> core eukaryotic genes, a total of  <dig>  complete and two  partial core eukaryotic genes were detected when assessing the genome assembly of um  <dig> isolate. these results from cegma indicate that both assembled genomes cover most of the eukaryote’s gene space with many of genes complete and not fragmented onto multiple contigs.

the percentage of the repetitive sequences in both genomes  was lower than that reported for other sordariomycetes genomes, for instance,  <dig>  % in magnaporthe grisea  <cit>  and 10 % in neurospora crassa  <cit> . of the repetitive sequences, transposable elements comprised  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes, respectively. the transposable elements were classified into eight  and  <dig>  families with the subclass of ty1_copia most abundant in um  <dig> and the subclass of isc <dig> most abundant in um  <dig> . these data suggest that the d. eschscholtzii genomes are poor in repetitive sequences. however, it has been reported that repeat contents in illumina-sequenced genomes are likely to be underestimated owing to a difficulty with the assembly of short repetitive reads into long repeat regions  <cit> . hence, the low repeat content of um genomes is probably due to the illumina technology that generates short reads that are prone to errors in the estimation of repetitive sequences, especially when the repetitive sequences are longer than the length of the sequencing reads .

the whole genome comparison between both um isolates was performed using the nucmer pipeline of the mummer software and visualized in dot-plot generated by mummerplot  <cit> . the generated synteny dot-plot showed the co-linearity between the two genomes and high levels of sequence homology to each other with more than 95 % sequence identity . this reveals a macrosyntenic conservation pattern of gene content within both d. eschscholtzii genomes.fig.  <dig> dot-plot representing whole genome comparison between um  <dig> and um  <dig> isolates. the comparison was performed using mummer  <dig>  . dots closest to the diagonal line represent co-linearity between the two genomes. the dots are color-coded as indicative of percent sequence identity. the red dots or diagonal line depicts the high sequence identity between both genomes



the genome sequence of d. eschscholtzii um  <dig> has been deposited in the european nucleotide archive  under the accession numbers . the version described in this paper is the first version of this genome sequence.

phylogenomic analysis
nine sordariomycetes genomes and two outgroups from dothideomycetes  were used for phylogenomic analysis with our um isolates of d. eschscholtzii. a total of  <dig>  proteins were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous families with  <dig> single-copy orthologs identified. concatenated alignments of  <dig>  single-copy orthologs were used to generate maximum likelihood and bayesian trees. congruence was achieved by both trees with the sordariomycetes genomes grouped into three orders of xylariales, magnaporthales, and sordariales . um  <dig> and um  <dig> clustered with the xylariales and formed a monophyletic group with d. eschscholtzii ec <dig>  which is an endophyte associated with the rainforest tree myroxylon balsamum found in the upper napo region of the ecuadorian amazon  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenomic position of both um  <dig> and um  <dig> within class sordariomycetes fungi. the phylogenomic tree was constructed based on orthologous proteins from  <dig> sordariomycetes genomes and two dothideomycetes genomes as outgroups using both maximum likelihood and bayesian methods



gene families
all predicted protein coding genes were analyzed using the orthomcl program to identify core gene families in the sordariomycetes fungi  and our um isolates of d. eschscholtzii. of the  <dig>  gene families identified,  <dig>  were shared by both um  <dig> and um  <dig> . among these  <dig> shared gene families were  <dig> clusters with known functions,  <dig> with unknown functions, and  <dig> without annotations in the database . the most abundant gene families shared by the two um isolates were those encoding cytochrome p <dig> , major facilitator superfamily  and the heterokaryon incompatibility protein . these protein families are likely to play an important role in fungus-host interactions, as cytochrome p <dig> proteins detoxify host defense compounds, major facilitator superfamily transporters export secondary metabolites and host-derived antimicrobial compounds, and the heterokaryon incompatibility proteins control vegetative reproduction to produce viable heterokaryons necessary for the adaptation to environment and to host defense mechanisms.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of shared gene families in both um isolates. summary of the number of shared gene families in um  <dig>  and um  <dig>  among  <dig>  gene families generated from all the sordariomycetes genomes. the numbers in the circles represent number of different sets of gene families that are shared by both isolates and unique to each isolate



the other shared gene families associated with fungus-host interactions included genes encoding the cfem domain-containing protein , fas <dig> domain-containing protein , and polysaccharide lyase family  <dig> protein . the cfem and fas <dig> domains are present in fungal membrane proteins that could function as cell surface receptors or adhesion molecules in interactions with the host  <cit> . the conservation of these genes suggests that both um isolates may encode specific cell surface proteins with important roles in the interaction with its specific host. the polysaccharide lyase family  <dig> protein  cleaves the backbone of rhamnogalacturonan-i, which is a major component of plant cell wall polysaccharide pectin. a previous study showed that no endophytes tested have the ability to degrade pectin, and suggested that an endophyte is likely to be a latent pathogen if it can degrade pectic substances  <cit> . hence, the presence of gene encoding rhamnogalacturonan lyase indicates the ability of both isolates to produce pectic enzyme for pectin degradation. in line with this, it is implied that both um isolates are likely to be latent pathogens, a lifestyle of d. eschscholtzii as described previously by another research group  <cit> .

both um isolates shared gene families associated with stress response, for instance, genes encoding acid trehalase  and clpb protein . the acid trehalases are involved in the assimilation of extracellular trehalose as a carbon source under nutrient limitation, as previously revealed in acid trehalase-deficient mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus nidulans  <cit> . the clpb protein is an atp-dependent molecular chaperone that plays an essential role in disaggregation and reactivation of the aggregated proteins in response to heat stress  <cit> . these stress responses are necessary for fungal survival and adaptation in harsh environmental conditions.

plant cell wall degrading enzymes
plant cell wall degradation contributes to the nutrient availability for fungal growth, and fungal penetration into host cells  <cit> . generally, the fungal enzymes involved in plant polysaccharide degradation are assigned to the classes of glycoside hydrolase , carbohydrate esterase  and polysaccharide lyase  in the cazyme database. both um isolates were found to contain carbohydrate-active enzymes  specifically for plant polysaccharide degradation, with a total of  <dig> and  <dig> putative functional domains identified in the um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes respectively . these numbers of cazyme domains were not far-off from those reported previously  <cit>  in the facultative pathogen aspergillus fumigatus , biotrophic fungus cladosporium fulvum , hemibiotrophic fungus fusarium graminearum , and hemibiotrophic fungus magnaporthe oryzae  .table  <dig> comparison of total number of cazymes with enzymatic activity for plant polysaccharide degradation

the number of cazymes for plant polysaccharide degradation identified in um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes was compared with those in the selected ascomycetous fungi of different lifestyles . note that the cazyme referred here indicates functional modules or domains but not genes. data obtained from zhao et al.  <cit> . enzyme abbreviations: c cellulase, hc hemicellulase, p pectin. fungal species abbreviations: ct chaetomium thermophilum, nc neurospora crassa, af aspergillus fumigatus, cg chaetomium globosum, tm tuber melanosporum, clg cladonia grayi, bg blumeria graminis, cf cladosporium fulvum, fg fusarium graminearum, mo magnaporthe oryzae, mp magnaporthe poae, gg gaeumannomyces graminis




in our um genomes, we identified functional domains of a) three classes of cellulase for the complete degradation of cellulose ; b) hemicellulase for the degradation of xylan , xyloglucan  and mannan ; c) pectinases  and d) lignin-degrading enzymes of which, cazyme families aa <dig>  and aa <dig>  appeared to be present in larger numbers than in other wood-decaying fungi like the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium and brown rot fungus postia placenta  <cit>  . as previously described by levasseur et al.  <cit> , the aa <dig> family is prevalent in some soft rot fungi from the ascomycota group. the family aa <dig> enzymes are known to provide hydrogen peroxide required by the family aa <dig> enzymes  for catalytic activity whereas family aa <dig> enzymes are known to be involved in the biotransformation or detoxification of lignocellulosic biomass  <cit> . generally, the families aa <dig> enzymes  and aa <dig> enzymes  are the main oxidative enzymes that degrade phenolic and non-phenolic structures of lignin. the small number of these enzymes identified in the um genomes indicates low oxidation activity for the degradation of lignin structure.table  <dig> comparison of total number of cazymes with ligninolytic auxiliary activities

the number of cazymes with ligninolytic auxiliary activities identified in um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes was compared with those in the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium and brown rot fungus postia placenta . note that the cazyme referred here indicates functional modules or domains but not genes. fungal species abbreviations: pc phanerochaete chrysosporium; pp postia placenta




the presence of cazymes with enzymatic activities for plant cell wall degradation implies that both human host-isolated d. eschscholtzii have once lived in the environment as wood-decaying fungi with degrading ability on plant biomass. these cazymes are suggested to be required to degrade the wood cell consisting of the primary cell wall, secondary cell wall, and middle lamella, with each cell component containing different ratios of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin. in addition, we identified six functional domains of cutinase  in the um  <dig> genome and five in the um  <dig> genome. cutinases are critical for the initial fungal penetration through the cuticular barrier attached to the epidermal cell walls in aerial parts of plants, such as leaves, flowers, fruits and young stems  <cit> . this indicates that both um isolates have the potential ability to penetrate through not only lignified woody cell walls but also plant cuticle and epidermal cell walls as well.

secondary metabolites
the wood-inhabiting endophyte d. eschscholtzii has been reported to produce arrays of secondary metabolites that have potential applications in medical and biofuel industries, such as immunosuppressive polyketides and volatile organic compounds . in the um  <dig> and um  <dig> genomes, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> secondary metabolite backbone genes respectively, including those encoding lovastatin nonaketide synthase, conidial pigment polyketide synthase alb <dig>  dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase  and citrinin polyketide synthase .

lovastatin nonaketide synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug  <cit> . the presence of this encoding gene suggests that both um isolates may produce essential enzyme needed to manufacture the potent drug lovastatin for lowering blood cholesterol. another polyketide synthase, alb <dig>  is responsible for the heptaketide naphtopyrene ywa <dig> synthesis in conidial pigmentation. tsai et al.  <cit>  reported that aspergillus fumigatus produces alb <dig> protein to synthesize the conidial pigment via the pentaketide pathway. this indicates that heptaketide synthase may be involved in the initiation of pentaketide melanin biosynthesis in d. eschscholtzii. melanin protects fungal spores and mycelium against environmental stresses, including desiccation, oxidizing agents and ultraviolet  light. thus, melanin production may be a protective trait that allows d. eschscholtzii to survive in harsh conditions such as drought that triggers desiccation and osmotic stress.

dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase  and citrinin polyketide synthase are involved in the synthesis of ergot alkaloids and antibiotic citrinin, respectively. as previously reported, ergot alkaloids were shown to be poisonous to herbivores  <cit> , while citrinin had antimicrobial activity against pathogens  <cit> . these bioactive compounds may play a similar role in both um isolates to confer beneficial protection to its host plant from the attacks of herbivores and pathogens subjected to further confirmation. a previous study reported that an endophytic daldinia eschscholtzii ec <dig> produces volatile organic compounds that are active against a broad range of plant pathogens  <cit> .

secreted peptidases
secreted peptidases facilitate fungal penetration and colonization of the host plant by degrading plant cell wall structural proteins and plant defense-related proteins  <cit> . examples are subtilisin-like peptidases  and metallopeptidases .

subtilisin-like peptidases are serine peptidases that have been found to be associated with colonization of the host by endophytes  <cit>  and plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes  encoding subtilisin-like peptidases . the metallopeptidases are known to cleave the glycoproteins of extracellular matrix that have been implicated in host resistance mechanisms against pathogen invasion  <cit> . for instance, the fungalysin of m <dig> family was shown to truncate non-structural host resistance proteins  <cit> . the presence of genes encoding penicillolysin of m <dig> family and fungalysin of m <dig> family in both genomes indicates the ability of um isolates to inactivate proteinaceous components from the plant defense response.

pathogenicity-associated genes
a protein blast analysis against the pathogen-host interaction database  revealed  <dig> and  <dig> putative phi genes  in the genomes of um  <dig> and um  <dig> respectively. with the eukaryotic orthologous group  functional classification, the putative phi genes were distributed into  <dig> functional categories with a higher number assigned to the category of signal transduction mechanisms .

signal transduction
the um genomes contained arrays of putative genes encoding signaling components, and here, we discuss those involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathways. the mapk signaling pathways are commonly found in all eukaryotes and are known to be involved in cell growth, differentiation, and stress response. from the genomic analysis, three putative mapk signaling pathways were proposed to be present in d. eschscholtzii um  <dig> and um  <dig> isolates, including the cell wall integrity pathway mediated by the ssk2/ssk22-pbs2-osm <dig> cascade, the osmoregulation pathway mediated by the bck1-mkk1/mkk2-mps <dig> cascade, and the mating/filamentation pathway mediated by the mst11-ste7-gpmk <dig> cascade .

numerous homologs of components of the osmoregulation pathway were identified in the um genomes, including sln <dig>  hik <dig>  sho <dig>  cdc <dig>  mst <dig> , mst <dig> , mst <dig> , pbs <dig>  osm <dig> , and ssk2/ssk <dig>  the osm <dig> gene was shown to encode a functional homolog of mapk hog <dig> and to be required in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . as referring to the high-osmolarity glycerol  pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , two upstream branches were predicted to activate the mapk pbs2-mapk osm <dig> module in both um isolates. one branch consisted of mapkk ssk2/ssk <dig> and a two-component histidine kinase phospho-relay system sln1-ypd1-ssk <dig>  with lacks homologs ypd <dig> and ssk1; another branch consisted of a putative membrane protein sho <dig>  cdc <dig>  mst <dig>  mst <dig>  and mst <dig>  besides osmotic stress, the osmoregulation pathway is also required for adaptation to oxidative stress, thermal stress, cellular morphogenesis regulation, and cell wall functionality  <cit> .

the um genomes contained several homologs of components of the cell wall integrity pathway, including the gtp-binding protein rho <dig>  mapkkk bck <dig>  mapkk mkk1/mkk <dig>  and mapk mps <dig> . generally, this mapk pathway is essential for cell wall integrity and pathogenesis  <cit> . some mapk slt <dig> homologs are also involved in other roles, such as conidium germination and polarized growth in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> , and response to various stresses, including oxidative and osmotic stresses, in candida albicans  <cit> .

the homolog of mapk gmpk <dig> of the mating/filamentation pathway was identified in both um genomes. in fusarium graminearum, gmpk <dig> is required to regulate mating, conidial production, and pathogenicity as well as the early induction of extracellular endoglucanase, xylanolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic activities  <cit> . other identified homologous components of this pathway included a mapkkk mst <dig> , a mapkk ste <dig>  an adaptor protein ste <dig>  a pak kinase mst <dig> , two small gtp-binding proteins ras <dig> and cdc <dig>  a gα subunit gpa <dig>  these components were previously reported to be involved in the activation of the mating/filamentation pathway in well-characterized saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . however, the homolog of g protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor gpr <dig> was not found in the um genomes. one ste12-like transcription factor, cst <dig> homolog was identified in the um genomes. as previously reported, this downstream transcription factor regulates genes involved in penetration and infectious growth in colletotrichum lagenarium  <cit> .

although the mapkkk-mapkk-mapk cascades are generally conserved in eukaryotes, the um isolates seemed to lack significant homologs of upstream protein kinases, such as ypd <dig> and ssk <dig> in the osmoregulation pathway, and gpr <dig> in the mating/filamentation pathway. this suggests that the upstream components in our um isolates may be different from those in other well-characterized organisms, like s. cerevisiae  <cit> , and may be novel receptor kinases for sensing environmental signals.

adaptation-associated stress response proteins
daldinia eschscholtzii has been isolated from diverse environments  where it may be subjected to many extreme conditions. the transition from a moderate environment to a hostile environment causes drastic changes in various parameters, including osmotic changes, ph changes, thermal changes, nutrient deprivations, as well as oxidative and nitrosative stresses. in both um genomes, we identified numerous stress-responsive genes as listed in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> 

daldinia spp. appear to be adapted to survive during periods of drought in the natural environment, and even when their woody host plant has been fire-damaged  <cit> . these harsh conditions result in osmotic and thermal stresses to daldinia spp. to maintain cellular turgor and prevent water loss, high concentrations of osmolytes, like glycerol, erythritol, mannitol, or trehalose are generated. the gene encoding osmotic stress-responsive proteins were identified in the um genomes, including os- <dig> orthologue, os-1/nik- <dig> orthologue, and pbsa orthologue that are involved in osmolytes accumulation, tpsa and orla that are involved in osmolyte trehalose biosynthesis, and gfdb that is involved in osmolyte glycerol biosynthesis. the increased production of osmolytes could induce the formation of vegetative structures conferring resistance to drought condition  <cit> , likes the stromatic structures formed by daldinia spp. for survival in drought  <cit> . numerous genes encoding thermal stress-responsive proteins were found in the genomes, for instance, genes encoding heat shock proteins  which are induced to refold or degrade damaged proteins, to unfold aggregated proteins, and also to help in stabilizing proteins and membranes  <cit> . unceasing wood decay will change the chemical composition and physical structure of wood which will, in turn, lead to nutrient deprivation stress. to tolerate this stressful condition, the alternate nutrient sources may be assimilated by expressing the genes associated with sources metabolism and nutrients uptake, such as treb, mep <dig>  mep <dig>  prnb, and prnc. the treb gene encodes a neutral trehalase that partially contributes to the energy requirements of spore germination under carbon limitation, as shown in the tre mutant of aspergillus nidulans  <cit> . the mep <dig> and mep <dig> genes are the examples of genes encoding proteins involved in nitrogen assimilation, and are predominantly expressed at low concentrations of ammonium or on poor nitrogen sources. the ammonium permease encoded by the mep <dig> gene has been shown to control nitrogen starvation-induced filamentous growth in candida albicans via interaction with ras <dig>  <cit> . in addition, fungi are able to utilize amino acids as sole nitrogen and/or carbon sources. in response to amino acid starvation, the transcription of the genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis are activated, such as prnb and prnc genes  <cit> , both of which were found in the um genomes.

reactive oxygen species  and reactive nitrogen species  produced by hosts are harmful to fungi by causing damage to their proteins, lipid membranes, and deoxyribonucleic acid  <cit> . in order to survive in this harsh environment, fungi must have mechanisms to detoxify these reactive molecular species and repair the cellular damages triggered by the oxidative and nitrosative stresses. the um isolates were found to contain genes encoding antioxidant enzymes  and enzymes involved in the production of secondary metabolites with antioxidant function  to handle ros, as well as the gene encoding nitrosative stress-responsive proteins  to cope with rns. the plant pathogenic fungus botrytis cinerea has been reported to produce these proteins to thrive against the oxidative and nitrosative environments generated by host plant cells  <cit> . these enzymes have also been implicated in the defense of opportunistic fungal pathogens  against the ros and rns produced by human phagocytes  <cit> . in the case of wood-decaying fungi, the extracellular hydrogen peroxide provided by oxidative enzymes is involved in the generation of highly reactive oxidants or hydroxyl radicals via the fenton reaction with the presence of iron cofactor  <cit> . these radicals are involved in the degradation process. the high level of generated ros is coped by the intracellular antioxidant enzymes to prevent fungal cell damage, as investigated in the previous study on the endogenous oxidative stress response of coriolus versicolor  <cit> . our cazymes analysis identified oxidative enzymes in both um genomes, with gmc oxidoreductases  present in a high number . this gmc oxidase  has been thought to play an important role in peroxide production in the wood-decaying fungus gloeophyllum trabeum  <cit> . other enzymes, the copper radical oxidase , fad-linked oxidoreductase  and glucose oxidase-like protein  have been demonstrated to be potentially involved in extracellular peroxide production in postia placenta  <cit> .

the fenton reaction requires iron as the cofactor of peroxidase enzymes for degradation activity. however, iron is sequestered by high-affinity iron binding proteins; thus, the iron acquisition system is required for wood-decaying fungi under iron starvation condition  <cit> . the um genomes featured genes involved in iron acquisition, namely genes encoding iron permease  and mitochondrial ornithine carrier . the ftr <dig> protein is required for high-affinity iron uptake in the reductive iron uptake system  <cit> , while the amca protein is involved in the supply of ornithine for siderophore biosynthesis  <cit> . the ftr <dig> protein was shown to be up-regulated during the growth of p. placenta on cellulose medium  <cit> .

changes in ph can be encountered upon environmental transition. the gene encoding pac <dig> ortholog of fusarium graminearum was identified in the um genomes. this gene has been previously reported to encode a ph regulator factor regulating the production of secondary metabolite in f. graminearum  <cit> . overall, the um isolates harbored many genes encoding stress response proteins that cope with triggered stresses under adverse conditions in their natural habitats. this feature could also serve to their advantage in surviving the adverse microenvironments of human niches.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic analysis of both um isolates revealed a common set of putative domains or genes that improves our understanding of the biological nature of d. eschscholtzii. the environmental origin of these isolates is suggested by the identification of putative cazyme arrays and genes encoding secreted peptidases related to plant cell wall degradation. as d. eschscholtzii has hitherto never been associated with human infections, our um isolates might have been entering into humans via the exposure of open wounds to the decaying wood material containing this organism and have been surviving in the human without causing any disease. both um genomes displayed a wide range of adaptation-associated stress response genes that are required by fungi for adaptation to hostile conditions in their natural habitat. these genes most likely also confer a selective advantage for survival and adaptation in adverse microenvironments in the human host. our genomic analysis also revealed other biological features, such as the identified genes encoding mapk signaling pathway components that suggest three mapk signaling cascades, and the identified secondary metabolite backbone genes that indicate the potential of the um isolates to produce various bioactive secondary metabolites. the biological functions of predicted genes have to be validated by further studies using appropriate approaches such as insertional mutagenesis, serial analysis of gene expression, microarray analysis, proteomics, and metabolomics.
