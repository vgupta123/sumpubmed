BACKGROUND
the lineage of pigeons and doves, columbiformes, is one of the most diverse non-passerine orders of birds. columbiformes are the sixth most speciose order among the  <dig> traditionally recognized orders of living birds, according to species counts by the international ornithologist’s committee world birdlist  <cit> . pigeons and doves inhabit every land area outside the arctic and antarctic, and display a wide range of variation in their ecological adaptations, although their relatively conserved anatomy and morphology has obscured phylogenetic relationships within the family. recent whole genome analyses resolved the placement of pigeons and doves as sister to sandgrouses  and mesites   <cit> .

previous genetic analyses have helped to clarify cryptic relationships among some branches of the columbiformes, and have provided insights into the timing of the diversification of this group . for example, ancient dna extracted from the remains of two large flightless pigeons, the extinct dodo  and its sister species, the solitaire , suggested that the closest living relative of these species is the nicobar pigeon   <cit> . this work also suggested that the dodo and solitaire lineages diverged 18– <dig> million years ago , during the late oligocene  <cit> . this date was biogeographically interesting because it was prior to the emergence of the two islands to which the flightless species were endemic  <cit> . similarly, old divergence estimates were obtained in a later study by pereira et al.  <cit> , who used a more taxonomically comprehensive phylogeny of both mitochondrial and nuclear dna to infer that the dodo and solitaire diverged from the caloenas lineage  <dig> – <dig> mya and from each other 15– <dig> mya. this study also concluded that the entire columbiform lineage probably originated during the cretaceous, and that the main period of diversification among columbiformes occurred at the paleocene/eocene boundary  <cit> .

here, we revisit the timing of the origin of and diversification within the columbiformes using a data set of complete mitochondrial genomes from a taxonomically broad selection of pigeons and doves. we assemble complete mitochondrial genomes from eleven pigeon species and from the yellow-throated sandgrouse, pterocles gutturalis. our new genomes include those of the extinct ryukyu wood pigeon , the extremely rare thick-billed ground dove , which is known from only two specimens  <cit> , the spotted green pigeon , which is also known as liverpool pigeon and is represented by only one surviving museum specimen  <cit> , the rodrigues solitaire , and the dodo . using these newly assembled mitochondrial genomes and available published mitochondrial genomes, we estimate a phylogeny to infer the major evolutionary relationships among the pigeons and doves using both a bayesian and maximum likelihood approach. further, we use a molecular clock approach, calibrated using whole-genome data  <cit> , to infer the timing of divergence between columbiformes, pterocliformes, and the galloansera.

RESULTS
a new phylogeny for pigeons and doves
both the ml and bayesian approaches to inferring a mitochondrial phylogeny result in the same overall topology, with strong statistical support for most nodes . the phylogeny supports two major clades, an indo-pacific clade , and a holarctic clade  that also includes new world pigeons. this or similar structure has been observed previously in more taxonomically focused data sets  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a molecular clock phylogeny for the pigeons and doves . star represents both 100 % bayesian posterior probability and 100 % ml bootstrap support. en dash  indicates ml bootstrap values smaller than 50 %. bars represent the 95 % ci for node ages, and † denotes extinct species. all, but raphus cucullatus and pezophaps solitaria, images reproduced from the book “pigeons and doves” by david gibbs, eustace barnes and john cox, reproduced with permission of the publishers, bloomsbury publishing




within the indo-pacific clade, our results corroborate several previously supported relationships. similarly to jønsson et al.  <cit>  and moyle et al.  <cit> , we find that alopecoenas is more closely related to the zebra dove  than it is to the luzon bleeding-heart dove . our results also support the previously identified close relationship between the dodo , solitaire , and nicobar pigeon   <cit> , and the sister relationship between the nicobar pigeon and the spotted green pigeon   <cit> . we also find that this group is sister to the crowned pigeons goura, supporting the result of shapiro et al.  <cit> , but in contrast to pereira et al.  <cit> , who placed the caloenas/raphus lineage within the didunculinae clade.

also within the indo-pacific clade, our results suggest that the genus otidiphaps, instead of belonging to the didunculinae clade, is sister to the highly diverse fruit pigeon clade  <cit> , which is represented in our phylogeny by hemiphaga. further investigation that includes other species that have been suggested to be closely related to these genera, such as the thick-billed ground pigeon   <cit> , will help to further disentangle these evolutionary relationships.

within the holarctic and new world clade, we identify a strongly supported subclade that includes the genera leptotila, zenaida and geotrygon. these species occur from north to south america and diverged from each other during the early miocene. the close relationship between zenaida and leptotila conflicts with previous results  <cit>  that placed the white-tipped dove, leptotila verreauxi, closer to the violaceous quail-dove, geotrygon violacea, than to zenaida. the difference between our and previous phylogenies may be attributable to including the mourning dove, zenaida macroura, in our analysis. the leptotila/zenaida/geotrygon clade has strong support in the bayesian analysis, but weak support in the maximum likelihood tree, highlighting the challenge of inferring and interpreting phylogenetic relationships from taxonomically limited data sets.

inferring the timing of diversification within pigeons and doves
the combination of recent genome-scale analyses of avian evolution  <cit>  and our new data set of complete mitochondrial genomes provides an opportunity to recalibrate the timing of the origin of and radiation within the columbiformes. when inferring time-calibrated phylogenies, careful consideration is required with respect to each fossil or type of calibration employed  <cit> . theoretical and empirical work have shown that using multiple calibration points generally leads to more robust estimates of evolutionary rates  <cit> . unfortunately, no fossils are known from within the family of pigeons and doves that could be used as calibration  <cit> . therefore, we used the time-scales estimated by jarvis et al.  <cit>  and prum et al.  <cit> , which agree with each other with respect to the timing of diversification of columbiformes.

we find that pigeons and doves most likely began to diversify during the late oligocene, and continued to diversify into the miocene . specifically, we find that the holarctic and indo-pacific clades diverge around  <dig>  mya , similar to  <cit> , which place the divergence of two columbiform clades during the mid-oligocene. this timing is in contrast to previous studies, which suggested that the columbiformes radiated much earlier and more slowly, over the course of the eocene and oligocene  <cit> . the transition from the eocene to the oligocene corresponds to a period of widespread global cooling  <cit>  and associated geological changes, including the opening of the drake passage and the formation of the wallacea region  <cit> . these changing global conditions may in part explain the timing of the rapid diversification within the columbidae, which contains many highly dispersive, “supertramp” species  <cit> .

we estimate that the dodo and solitaire diverged around  <dig>  mya , during the early/middle miocene transition, rather than around the oligocene/miocene transition , as previously proposed. we also find that the common ancestor of the dodo and solitaire diverged from caloenas around  <dig> mya , rather than during the middle or latest eocene . although our estimated divergence dates are more recent than those proposed previously, these dates indicate that both flightless pigeons diverged from their closest flying relative at least  <dig> mya prior to the emergence of mauritius and rodrigues islands, to which the flightless birds were endemic  <cit> . this finding corroborates previous claims that these lineages must have originated elsewhere  <cit> . the passenger pigeon, ectopistes migratorius, is known to be closely related to the lineage of large new word pigeons, represented in our study by the band-tailed pigeon, patagioenas fasciata  <cit> . however, the timing of divergence between these lineages has been unknown. our phylogeny indicates that passenger pigeons and band-tailed pigeons share a common ancestor around  <dig>  mya . this common ancestor diverged from other old world pigeons during the transition between the oligocene and the miocene, around  <dig>  mya . this result contrasts with the results of pereira et al.  <cit> , which placed the split of patagioenas/ectopistes and the remaining columbids around  <dig> mya.

rapid diversification, such as that identified here for the columbiformes, may lead to variation among gene trees due to the effects of incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> , which can lead to inference of different phylogenies for different loci. in future, therefore, it will be important to confirm the evolutionary hypotheses presented here using multiple, independently inherited markers. the use of additional calibration points will also likely increase the precision of the nodes age estimates. nonetheless, the strong support for the branching order of our phylogeny provides new insights into many of the cryptic evolutionary relationships among pigeons and doves, and attests to the resolving power of complete mitochondrial genomes, at least for inference of the evolutionary history of this locus. broader taxonomic sampling and the addition of a greater diversity of extinct lineages and calibration points may further resolve the timing and nature of evolutionary diversification within this very diverse group of birds.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a new phylogeny of the pigeons and doves  based on complete mitochondrial genomes from  <dig> pigeon species including several extinct or extremely rare species. the branching order in the phylogenetic tree is strongly statistically supported. by including a molecular rate calibration from recent genome-scale analyses, we infer that the lineage of pigeons and doves began to diversify during the oligocene/miocene transition, which is a more recent diversification than has been suggested previously. we interpret the phylogenetic results in the context of previous research, and support the recognition of the genus alopecoenas.
