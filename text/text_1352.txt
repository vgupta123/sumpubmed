BACKGROUND
purpureocillium lilacinum, previously named as paecilomyces lilacinus, belongs to the fungal order hypocreales that harbors species known to produce a diversity of secondary metabolites and bio-actives  <cit> . p. lilacinum produces paecilotoxin and is considered as a significant biological control agent against plant parasitic nematodes, especially economically important species of meloidogyne incognita  <cit> . diseases caused by plant-parasitic nematodes are considered as one of the major threats for global food security . nematode infection in economically important crops results in an estimated annual loss of us $ <dig> billion  <cit> . research on nematode-suppressive soils has revealed a substantial presence of nematophagous fungi p. lilacinum and pochonia chlamydosporia  <cit> . similar to other species in hypocreales, p. lilacinum has a broad host range and its various strains parasitize different species of nematodes and insects  <cit> . in addition, endophytically-colonized p. lilacinum has been recently reported to adversely affect reproduction of cotton-aphids putatively by inducing systemic response in plant  <cit> .

the fungal order hypocreales consists of plant-pathogens, insect-pathogens, nematode-pathogens, plant-endophytes and mycoparasites. these fungi are multi-trophic in nature and several transitions between lifestyles have been predicted in their evolutionary history . p. lilacinum is a ubiquitous soil hyphomycete and carry out saprophytic activities in varied habitats including agricultural fields, forests, grassland, deserts and estuarine sediments. different isolates of p. lilacinum are found resistant to a wide range of temperature and ph  <cit> . on the other hand, p. lilacinum is also reported to exercise parasitic or endophytic lifestyles in the presence of a host organism such as nematodes, aphids and cotton plants  .

p. lilacinum infects eggs and females of meloidogyne spp. and causes death of the nematode embryos in  <dig> to 7 days  <cit> . a strain of p. lilacinum, strain  <dig>  is now an active ingredient in several commercial bio-nematicides  <cit> . however, the molecular basis of the pathogenic mechanism employed by p. lilacinum against nematodes has been meagerly elucidated till date. whole genome sequencing efforts of other hypocreales fungi  have revealed that these genomes code for an array of hydrolytic enzymes, secondary metabolites/bioactives, non-ribosomal protein synthetases  and polyketide synthetases  that are essential for their bio-control attribute. experimental evidences show that extracellular hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, collagenases and chitinases are involved in the degradation of egg-shell components by p. lilacinum  <cit> . despite of strong prospect of secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes produced by p. lilacinum in biological control of phyto-pathogens, only one gene encoding for serine protease  <cit>  and one encoding for keratinase  <cit>  have been molecularly characterized so far.

considering the increasing demand for alternative plant-pathogen management approaches in agricultural systems, we carried out whole genome annotation and comparative genomic analyses of the nematophagous fungus p. lilacinum. the study provides new insights into the genome of this commercially important biological control agent. the work would pave way for understanding important pathways and genes utilized by p. lilacinum to carry out nematophagous and endophytic activities, which is expected to aid in developing methods to protect crop plants.

RESULTS
global genome structure
the p. lilacinum genome was sequenced to 200 x coverage and by mapping the reads to contigs, the genome sequence was assembled into  <dig> scaffolds with total gap size of  <dig>  bases. the sum of the scaffolds length is equal to  <dig>  mb. the longest scaffold length was of  <dig>  mb. the n <dig> and n <dig> values were  <dig> ,308 bp and  <dig>  bp respectively. the predicted assembly size was  <dig>  mb by k-mer analysis with the best kmer value =  <dig> . the maker annotation pipeline  <cit>  predicted  <dig>  protein coding genes, which is comparatively more than other species belonging to entomopathogenic or mycoparasitic families of hypocreales. core eukaryotic genes mapping   <cit>  analysis against a set of  <dig> conserved protein families that occur in a wide range of core eukaryotic gene datasets  http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/datasets /genome completeness/index.html#sct2) found  <dig>  % of the core genes were matched, indicating that the draft genome sequence of p. lilacinum was largely complete . trnascan-se  <cit>  predicted a total of  <dig> trnas in the genome. the average gene density  and the average gene length  of p. lilacinum are similar to other ascomycetous fungi  <cit> . the genome size , total number of predicted genes  and the %gc  content of p. lilacinum are comparable to the nematophagous fungus pochonia chlamydosporia  of hypocreales . when compared with other fungal orders, the genome size of p. lilacinum is also similar to that of trichaptum abientinum  belonging to the order polyporales in phylum basidiomycota and melanomma pulvi-pyris  belonging to the order pleosporales in phylum ascomycota  <cit> .table  <dig> genomic features of p. lilacinum

mobile elements
a  <dig>  % fraction of the p. lilacinum genome was estimated to consist of repeated sequences. a total of  <dig> retrotransposons ,  <dig> dna transposons , and  <dig> unknown element  were identified in the genome. the number and family wise distribution of mobile elements in p. lilacinum genome is comparable other insect pathogenic fungal species in hypocreales .

gene ontology  based distribution of genes
of the total predicted genes in p. lilacinum,  <dig>  had blastp hits and  <dig> proteins  had interproscan hits. genes having interproscan hits were investigated for distribution into functional categories based on gene ontology . allocation by go domains, “biological process” and molecular function”, according to generic terms at level  <dig> in blast2go is presented in fig.  <dig>  major “biological process” groups were constituted by the following go terms: organic substance metabolic process , primary metabolic process , biosynthesis process , establishment of localization , catabolic process , response to stress , and pathogenesis genes . distribution according to “molecular function” largely encompassed those genes implicated in heterocyclic compound binding , ion binding , hydrolase and lyase activity , oxidoreductase activity , small molecule binding , protein binding , transferase activity , carbohydrate and carbohydrate derivative binding  and trans-membrane transporter activity .fig.  <dig> go based functional annotation of genes present in the p. lilacinum genome. biological process domains and molecular function domains



phylogenomic relationships
neurospora crassa belongs to the order sordariales. the orders hypocreales and sordariales belong to the fungal class sordariomycetes under ascomycetes. in our phylogenomic analysis neurospora crassa served as an out group. orthologous protein clusters generated by mcl clustering tool embedded in the phylogenomic pipeline hal  <cit>  were sieved to get non-redundant clusters. aligned clusters were concatenated to generate super-alignments that were used to build maximum likelihood phylogeny tree.

the constructed phylogenomic tree  mimicked the recent taxonomic classification with the representative species belonging to the five families in hypocreales being clustered under a separate node from neurospora crassa. the family nectriaceae comprising primarily of plant-pathogens such as f. graminearum and f. oxysporum diverged the earliest. members of hypocreaceae  are widely known to possess mycoparasitic life style. hypocreaceae composed a sister node to cordycipitaceae family that holds insect-pathogenic fungal species beauveria bassiana and cordyceps militaris. the family clavicipitaceae, which by and large includes pathogens of insects, was represented by metarhizium robertsii, metarhizium acridum and a nematophagous fungus pochonia chlamydosporia in this study. members of ophiocordycipitaceae included tolypocladium inflatum and p. lilacinum. t. inflatum is a pathogen of beetle larvae and p. lilacinum is a nematophagous fungus. cordycipitaceae and ophiocordycipitaceae seemed to have diverged earlier in comparison to clavicipitaceae in the evolutionary history. genome sequencing data of the species belonging to the remaining two families niessliaceae and bionectriaceae in hypocreales has not been released as yet in the public domain by doe  and therefore, not included in the analysis.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of p. lilacinum




phylogenomic analysis presented in this study was largely in agreement with typical phylogenetic studies that have sampled a large number of hypocreales species and constructed evolutionary relationships from meta-analysis of multi-gene datasets  <cit> . however, taxonomic refinement of clavicipitaceae, which was grouped into clavicipitaceae a, b and c by multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, could only be achieved by phylogenomic analysis done using genome-scale data that inferred polyphyletic origin of taxons with entomopathogenic fungi in three separate families in hypocreales  <cit> . our results were in absolute confirmation with a previous report that presented an elaborate account of phylogenomic relationships of hypocreales  <cit> . our phylogenomic analysis indicated lifestyle transitions among the different species in the hypocreales from plant-pathogens in initially diverging taxon  to mycoparasitism  and entomopathogenic trophic behaviors .

taxonomic placement of p. lilacinum remained ambiguous until recent. the fungus was previously placed under trichocomaceae that contains the very familiar genus penicillium. genome-scale phylogeny constructed in this study clearly places p. lilacinum among taxons with insect-pathogens and under the family ophiocordycipitaceae along with t. inflatum.

potential pathogenesis-related genes
to find potential pathogenesis-related genes, a whole genome blast analysis was conducted against the pathogen-host interaction  gene database version  <dig>   <cit>  at e < 1*10− <dig>  phi db catalogs experimentally validated pathogenic, virulence and effector genes from fungal, oomycete and bacterial pathogens of fungi, insects, plants and animals hosts. homolog identification in phi db, therefore, indicates towards putative role of the gene in pathogenesis. approximately  <dig>  %  of the protein-coding genes with blastp hits in the genome of p. lilacinum showed homology with the genes present in the phi db.

total number of genes sharing homology with phi db in the  <dig> hypocreales genomes analyzed in this study is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  using blastp  and phi version  <dig> , highest number of phi homologous genes were observed in plant pathogens f. oxysporum , which was followed by p. lilacinum . the insect pathogens m. acridum and m. robertsii were found to possess  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively. surprisingly, the genome of the other nematophagous fungus p. chlamydosporia contained only  <dig> phi homologs as compared to  <dig> homologs in p. lilacinum.

genes in phi db  were further sieved to select a set of genes that were experimentally validated for their role in pathogenicity by knock-out experiments. blastp search revealed presence of  <dig>  homologs to “loss of pathogenicity genes”,  <dig>  “increased virulence genes”,  <dig>  “reduced virulence genes”,  <dig>  “effector plant virulence genes”,  <dig>  “mixed pathogenesis genes” and  <dig>  “lethal genes” in the p. lilacinum genome.

to identify the putative involvement of the pathogenesis related genes in biological and molecular processes, blast2go based annotation was carried out. based on presence of the go domains, phi genes were grouped into  <dig> biological-functional groups and  <dig> molecular-function groups . major biological process groups included genes related to cellular metabolic processes , primary metabolism , biosynthetic processes , regulation of biological processes , establishment of localization  and response to stress . however, unlike  <dig> phi genes in p. chlamydosporia, only one phi gene was found under go term “pathogenesis” in p. lilacinum. fisher exact test was done for statistical evaluation of difference in genetic make-up between p. lilacinum and p. chlamydosporia with respect to important genes. additional file 1: table s <dig> shows that significantly different proportion of establishment of localization, primary metabolic process, glycoside hydrolases, secondary metabolites, response to stress genes were present in p. lilacinum as compared to p. chlamydosporia, with abundance of serine proteases in p. lilacinum.fig.  <dig> go based functional annotation of genes with homologs in phi db. biological process domains and molecular function domains



these findings probably indicate towards differences in the genetic arsenals between the two nematophagous fungi, p. lilacinum and p. chlamydosporia, belonging to two different families ophiocordycipitaceae and clavicipitaceae respectively of hypocreales. fewer matches with go term “relationship between organisms” was not unexpected as only  <dig> genes in the complete genome could be identified under the category “pathogenesis” in blast2go based annotation of the genome . interestingly, of the  <dig>   <dig> protein-coding genes identified as associated with the go terms “hydrolase activity” and “lyase activity” under “molecular function” domain in whole genome analysis ,  <dig> hydrolase and  <dig> lyase activity signatures were found in the phi db, which is suggestive of their importance in pathogenesis .

secreted proteins in p. lilacinum
the secreted proteome plays a crucial role in defining the ability of a fungal pathogen to interact with the host and the environment. using the online tool signalp , a total of  <dig>  secreted peptides were predicted in p. lilacinum genome, of which  <dig> had homologs in phi db . the number of secreted proteins reported for the insect pathogens m. robertsii and m. acridum  <cit>  and plant pathogens  <cit>  and non-pathogens  <cit>  are estimated using signalp  instead of the recent version signalp  and therefore, a comparison between p. lilacinum genome and the remaining species is difficult. considerably large assimilation of secretary proteins in p. lilacinum genome could indicate towards increased complexity of secreted proteome for improved adaptation to environment.

signal transduction and gene regulation
multiple lifestyles acquired by the fungus p. lilacinum demands for swift adjustments to varied environments and host. genes involved in signal transduction and gene regulation are crucial in lifestyle transitions. fungal g-protein coupled receptors  are required for transducing environmental cues, which involve niche recognition, nutrient sensing and recognition of host immune system  <cit> . in pathogenic fungi parastagonospora nodorum, alpha subunits of g protein are found important in causing plant-disease by transducing extracellular signals  <cit> . in magnaporthe sp., the pth11-like gpcr triggers cell differentiation in response to plant inductive cues and mediates pathogenicity  <cit> . p. lilacinum genome encoded  <dig> gpcrs, compared to an average of  <dig> in other fungi  <cit> .  <dig> gpcrs shared homology with pth11-like gpcrs . number of total gpcrs and pth11-like gpcrs in p. lilacinum genome are comparable to that of c. militaris  <cit>  but much lesser than sequenced clavicipitaceae fungi, metarhizium spp.  <cit> .

histidine kinases  are largely implicated in environment sensing and stress responses in fungi  <cit> . p. lilacinum possesses  <dig> hk proteins compared to  <dig> in m. robertsii and  <dig> in m. acridum. substantially increased number of hks could indicate towards efficient signal transduction capacity of the multi-trophic fungi, p. lilacinum, under rapidly changing environmental conditions.

protein kinases  are important in regulation of cellular and metabolic processes primarily signal transduction.  <dig> pk genes were identified in p. lilacinum as compared to  <dig> in pochonia chlamydosporia,  <dig> in c. militaris,  <dig> in m. robertsii and  <dig> in m. acridum. presence of homologs for a significant subset  of pks in phi db emphasizes possibility of these genes in pathogenicity. number of signal transduction genes and their homologs in phi db has been shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> gene families important in nematode pathogenesis and their homologs in phi db



genes involved in transportation and detoxification of compounds
in pathogenic and parasitic fungi, atp-binding cassette  transporters are largely implicated in defense mechanism and protect the fungus from secondary metabolites or toxins produced by the host  <cit> . the p. lilacinum genome coded for  <dig> abc transporters, of which  <dig> had homologous gene present in the phi db. another important family of transporters known as major facilitator super-family  is frequently involved in the transport of a wide range of substrates and nutrient sensing  <cit> . the genome of p. lilacinum encoded  <dig> mfs transporters, of which  <dig> genes had homologs in phi db.

cytochrome p <dig>  monooxygenase superfamily mediates numerous functions in fungi. most importantly, cyps contribute in multifaceted metabolism and adaptation to varied ecological niches  <cit> . filamentous fungi produce an array of secondary metabolites, biosynthesis of many being mediated by cyps  <cit> . cyps are also known to contribute towards pathogenicity and life style of fungi. in p. lilacinum  <dig> cyp genes were identified, of which only  <dig> exhibited homologous counterparts in the phi db. number of cyp enzymes in p. lilacinum is similar to clavicipitaceae fungi  but is more than previously reported plant pathogenic  fungi. additional file 1: table s <dig> enlists pth <dig> like gpcrs, histidine kinases, protein kinases, abc, mfs and cyp genes in p. lilacinum. number of transportation & detoxification genes and their homologs in phi base has been shown in fig.  <dig> 

hydrolytic enzymes
to be a successful parasite, saprophyte and endophyte, p. lilacinum codes for an array of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, chitinases, lipases and esterases. the size of hydrolytic enzyme families with putative biological function and number of homologs in phi db has been presented in fig.  <dig>  our analysis of the p. lilacinum genome unraveled the likely genetic requirements to invade the egg shells of nematodes by disintegration of egg shell components.

proteases
by carrying out a blastp  search against the merops protease database  <cit> , we identified  <dig> genes coding for proteases in the p. lilacinum genome. according to their catalytic type these proteases were divided into five categories, which were further distributed into  <dig> families . similar to other entomopathogenic fungi, serine proteases with  <dig> genes constituted the largest category of proteases in p. lilacinum, the three major classes being prolyl oligopeptidases , prolyl aminopeptidases  and subtilisins . subtilisin-like serine proteases produced by p. lilacinum have been identified to degrade protein components of both nematode and insect eggs  <cit> . in addition, reports indicate that subtilisin-like serine proteases could have been crucial during the evolution of pathogenicity of nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes  <cit> . in nematophagous fungus pochonia chlamydosporia, in addition to subtilisins, serine carboxypeptidases are also instrumental in the penetration of nematode egg shell  <cit> . 59 % of serine proteases showed expression under endophytism in p. chlamydosporia  <cit> . the p. lilacinum genome coded for  <dig> serine proteases of s <dig> family ,  <dig> serine proteases of s <dig>  and  <dig> serine proteases of s <dig> family . expression of 50 % of genes belonging to s <dig> family during root endophytism in pochonia chlamydosporia, underscored the importance of serine carboxypeptidases in disintegration of the nematode egg shell. in our study, we found that  <dig> genes coding for serine proteases had homologous present in the phi db , of which  <dig> were subtilisins  and  <dig> were serine carboxypeptidases, which further supported their role in pathogenicity. similar to p. chlamydosporia, the second largest group of proteases in p. lilacinum genome was made of metalloproteases, with  <dig> genes spread over  <dig> families. the largest family within metalloproteases was glutamate carboxypeptidases . the important classes of metalloproteases that were reportedly expressed during endophytism in p. chlamydosporia were fungalysins , carboxypeptidases  and deuterolysins . the p. lilacinum genome harbored  <dig> fungalysins,  <dig> carboxypeptidases and  <dig> deuterolysins quite in an adequate proportion with pochonia chlamydosporia genome. remaining proteases in the genome belonged to threonine protease class with  <dig> genes, cysteine proteases with  <dig> genes and aspartic proteases with  <dig> genes.

glycosides hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases
the egg-shell components of nematodes include structural polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitin and mannan. in order to penetrate the nematode egg, p. lilacinum needs to produce glycoside hydrolases  and carbohydrate esterases  for degradation of polysaccharides. using cazy database  <cit>  and performing hmmer  <cit>  scan based on the profile compiled in dbcan release  <dig> ; we predicted presence of  <dig> glycoside hydrolases  and  <dig> carbohydrate esterases  in p. lilacinum genome. the size of the gh family in p. lilacinum is very close to f. graminearum  of nectriaceae and p. chlamydosporia  of clavicipitaceae, as compared to small sized family in m. acridum  and m. robertsii  of clavicipitaceae . chitinases coded by  <dig> genes of gh <dig> class were the most abundant of all glycoside hydrolases in p. lilacinum.  <dig> genes encoding for cellulases belonging to gh5–gh <dig> families were identified in this genome. cellulases were found to be expressed during root colonization in p. chlamydosporia and thus could be important in life style transitions in p. lilacinum.

carbohydrate esterases  carry out the de-o or de-n-acylation of esters or amides and other substituted saccharides, in which sugars play the role of alcohol and amine. our analysis showed that hypocreales fungi  have genes from  <dig> of the  <dig> ce families, with ce <dig> being the only missing family . we identified  <dig> genes encoding carbohydrate esterase enzymes in p. lilacinum, with ce <dig> being the largest family. members of families ce <dig> and ce <dig> possessed maximum number of genes coding for carbohydrate esterases. ce <dig> and ce <dig> share the common activities of carboxylesterase and endo- <dig> -β-xylanase  <cit> . however, they greatly differ in substrate specificity. the number of ce enzymes in p. lilacinum genome was more than that reported for clavicipitaceae family and less than nectriaceae family under the hypocreales order.

in p. lilacinum  <dig> gh and  <dig> ce genes had homologs counterparts in phi db . the genome seems to be enriched with hydrolytic enzymes and employs an assortment of proteases, glycoside hydrolases, and carbohydrate esterases to breach the egg-shell barrier in order to parasitize nematode.

secondary metabolite genes and clusters
species in hypocreales are known for production of secondary metabolites that include toxins and pharmaceutically active components. p. lilacinum is widely known to produce a leucinostatin named as paecilotoxin. leucinostatins are linear nine residue peptabiotics, characterized by n-terminal proline acetylated by meha and c-terminal b-ala amidated by dpd. leucinostatin is ubiquitously present among all the p. lilacinum isolates and its production does not correlate with the habitat or host of the different strains  <cit> . production of secondary metabolite other than paecilotoxin has not been reported to date from p. lilacinum. genetic analysis to unveil gene clusters for production of different types of secondary metabolites would help in identification of important bio-actives.

the genes responsible for biosynthesis, export, and transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolites are often found in contiguous gene cluster. secondary metabolite unique regions finder  is a web-based tool  <cit>  that finds secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters and pathways in fungal genomes based on their genomic context and domain content. another in silico pipeline antismash  <dig>   <cit> , identifies bio-synthetic loci coding for secondary metabolites including oligosaccharide antibiotics, phenazines, homoserine lactones, thiopeptides, furans and phosphonates, in addition to secondary metabolite classes: polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenes, aminoglycosides, aminocoumarins, indolocarbozoles, lantibiotics, bacteriocins, nucleosides, beta-lactams, butyrolactones, siderophores, melanins. using smurf,  <dig> secondary metabolite genes were identified . these genes included  <dig> pks ,  <dig> pks-like enzymes,  <dig> nrps ,  <dig> nrps-like enzymes,  <dig> hybrid and  <dig> dmat . in comparison to other sequenced fungi in hypocreales, smurf analysis indicated that p. lilacinum has lesser capacity for the production of bio-actives and toxins. however, antismash run on the genome data identified  <dig> clusters , which is close to the maximum  reported in entomopathogenic fungus m. robertsii  <cit> . antismash based functional annotations of the  <dig> clusters are presented in . antismash analysis suggested that p. lilacinum could encode several non-conventional secondary metabolites by using alternate gene clusters.

bioinformatics tool natural product domain seeker    was used to detect and extract condensation  and ketosythase  domains through a broad set of manually curated reference genes from well-characterized chemical pathways. we found  <dig> pks-derived ks domains and  <dig> nrps-derived c- domain in p. lilacinum .

quantitative real-time pcr
to validate importance of serine proteases expressed by p. lilacinum in nematode pathogenesis, quantitative real-time pcr analyses were carried out. three subtilisin-like serine proteases, namely, g <dig> t <dig>  g <dig> t <dig>  and g <dig> t <dig>  were selected as target genes for the analyses and actin gene was chosen as reference gene. real-time pcr results confirmed up-regulation of all three subtilisin-like serine proteases and showed that, in the presence of eggs of nematode host , the copy number of the target genes of p. lilacinum was increased in comparison to control  fig.  <dig>  notably, relative expression of g <dig> t <dig>  g <dig> t <dig> genes was significantly higher  on 4th and 10th day post inoculation of p. lilacinum with the host nematode eggs. the outcome of quantitative real-time pcr analyses underscore potential role of these subtilisin-like serine proteases in nematode egg shell degradation.fig.  <dig> relative quantitative gene expression for subtilisin-like serine proteases in p. lilacinum in presence and absence of the nematode host  eggs



CONCLUSIONS
the whole genome annotation and comparative genomic analyses of the first draft genome sequence of monophyletic genus purpureocillium lilacinum provided insight into its genetic make-up and phylogenetic placement. presence of a variety of hydrolytic proteins in the genome illustrated putative genetic machinery involved in nematophagous activity. quantitative real-time pcr analyses corroborated role of serine proteases in nematode pathogenesis. identification of a plethora of gpcrs, transporter proteins, cyps and protein and histidine kinase proteins indicate the tentative genetic components important for life style transitions and substantiate the observed multi-trophic behaviour viz., saprophyte, egg-parasite, and plant-endophyte of p. lilacinum. sizable representation of important enzyme families in pathogen-host interaction database corroborates importance of the identified proteins in nematode pathogenesis. significantly large number of secondary metabolite clusters identified through antismash underscores immense capacity of p. lilacinum genome to synthesize a variety of typical and atypical secondary metabolites. the gene lists for various protein families provided here, would be useful for future experiments. in addition, phylogenomic study involving nine other fungi from five different families under the order hypocreales, provide confirmation that p. lilacinum, which was earlier erroneously grouped with paecilomyces under the order eurotiales, belongs to the ophiocordycipitaceae family in the order hypocreales. in conclusion, findings of this genomic analysis would be beneficial for development of effective biological-control approaches to manage agricultural damage incurred by plant parasitic nematodes.
