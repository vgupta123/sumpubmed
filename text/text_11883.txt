BACKGROUND
nitrilases enable hydrolysis of nitriles to be performed under mild conditions and often in a stereo- or regioselective manner. these enzymes have thus great potential in organic synthesis but drawbacks such as instability, low activity or low selectivity lessen their practical use  <cit> . these limits may be overcome by searching for new nitrilases or improving known ones. recently, the former approach has often made use of database mining  <cit> .

according to genbank search, not only bacteria, which have been intensively exploited as a source of nitrilases since the 1980s, but also filamentous fungi harbour a large number of nitrilase genes  <cit> . apart from the teleomorph/anamorph pair gibberella/fusarium, the aspergillus genus is a rich source of these enzymes, which exhibit low homology to bacterial nitrilases and thus may differ in their catalytic properties.

we have recently purified and characterized the first nitrilase in the aspergillus genus, namely from the aspergillus niger k <dig> strain  <cit> , which was selected by nitrilase activity screening in filamentous fungi. in this study, the gene encoding this enzyme was amplified, cloned and sequenced and the protein deduced from gene sequencing was found to be highly homologous with a number of putative nitrilases in aspergillus and penicillium.

the natively expressed enzyme exhibited high specific activities towards  aromatic nitriles and was fairly stable under operational conditions for its use in nitrile hydrolysis  <cit> . here, to potentiate its industrial utility, we expressed this enzyme in escherichia coli. heterologous expression has not been reported for any fungal nitrilases, as far as we know. on the other hand, a number of nitrilases from bacteria  <cit> , and from the plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  have been expressed in e. coli, as well as several cyanide hydratases from fungi  <cit> .

recombinant e. coli cells harbouring the a. niger gene produced the active enzyme . however, this enzyme differed in its catalytic properties from the wild-type enzyme that was purified from a. niger k <dig> . the quaternary structures of nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt were also different. nitrilases and cyanide hydratases are proteins with unique structural properties, being able to exist in a number of different homooligomeric species - dimers, short homo-oligomeric spirals and extended helices  <cit> . the occurrence of these structural types in nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt was compared, indicating lower tendency of the former enzyme to form long helices. the homogeneity of this enzyme was enhanced by maturing  during storage of the refolded enzyme, followed by size exclusion chromatography. the resulting protein appeared to be useful for analytical centrifugation and electron microscopy studies. it is also promising for nitrilase crystallization, which is thought to be impaired in enzymes forming the aforementioned helices  <cit> .

a deeper insight into three-dimensional structures of nitrilases is impaired by missing crystal structures. the previous models of nitrilases from pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit>  and rhodococcus rhodochrous  <cit>  were therefore generated by exploiting their homology with crystallized members of the nitrilase superfamily. here we have used an analogous approach to construct the first model of a fungal nitrilase, which is distantly related to the above bacterial enzymes.

RESULTS
determining the aspergillus niger k <dig> nitrilase sequence
previously, the determination of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of nit-anigwt suggested a high similarity of this enzyme to a group of highly conserved putative nitrilases  from the aspergillus genus . this enabled us to design degenerate primers, which were based on the n-terminal and a conserved internal sequence of two putative aspergillus fumigatus nitrilases. combining the sequence data obtained from amplifications using both nitrilase-specific primers and from 5'-race and 3'-race amplifications provided a complete sequence of the nitrilase gene .

the amino acid sequence deduced from this nitrilase gene confirmed that nit-anigwt was highly similar to putative nitrilases from aspergillus  and neosartorya fischeri . while our study of nit-anigwt sequencing was in progress, a sequence of a nitrilase-coding gene  from another a. niger strain  was deposited in the database. the amino acid sequence of this hypothetical protein was 99% identical to that of the enzyme being studied by us. later, another very similar nitrilase   was sequenced in penicillium chrysogenum. however, neither of these two nitrilases has been studied at the protein level.

nitrilase expression, purification and refolding
the expression of the enzyme was achieved with the pok <dig> and pok <dig> vectors and  <dig> out of the  <dig> e. coli strains tested , the bl <dig> and bl21-codonplus-ril strains being exceptions. the absence of nitrilase activity in these strains may have been caused by low transformation efficiency, endonuclease activity or limited translation due to codon bias. in all other strains, the nitrilase was expressed after iptg addition and formed about one half of the soluble cellular proteins, as determined by sds-page . however, the nitrilase activities of the recombinant strains were not as high. total activities of bl <dig> or rosetta-gami strains were between  <dig> and  <dig> u l- <dig>  while those of arctic express strains were on the average lower . these values were at most approx. twofold higher compared to those achieved in the native producer a. niger k <dig>   <cit> . however, the time required for maximum activity yield in e. coli was only ca.  <dig> h, which was approx. three times less than in a. niger. of the above e. coli strains, the highest activity of approx.  <dig> u l- <dig> was obtained in bl21-gold strain carrying the pok <dig> plasmid  containing the nit gene). further increase in total activity to approx.  <dig> u l- <dig> was brought about by variation of cultivation parameters  and by co-expression of ptf <dig> plasmid . however, the latter accounted for only about 10% increase in the total activity. this strain designated e. coli bl21-gold has been used throughout further work. nit-anigrec was purified from this culture to near homogeneity with an approx. 2-fold increase in specific activity and 35% yield . as expected from the nitrilase activity of the whole cells, the specific activity of the purified enzyme for benzonitrile -  <dig>  u mg- <dig> - was significantly  lower than that of nit-anigwt -  <dig>  u mg- <dig>  <cit> .

enzyme activity was assayed with  <dig> mm benzonitrile .

as the above results suggested the possibility of incorrect protein folding, the protein was fully denatured in  <dig> m guanidine-hcl and  <dig> m tcep , and refolded in vitro. however, the best refolding conditions  selected by screening the commercial ifold  <dig> system merely led to the recovery of the initial activity and not to its improvement.

according to sds-page analysis , the apparent molecular weight of the subunit of the purified enzyme  was higher than that of nit-anigwt -  <dig>  kda  <cit> . this indicated that the latter protein underwent a post-translational modification in its native environment. in order to clarify the molecular nature of this difference, we performed n-terminal sequencing and peptide mass mapping with both nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt . the n-terminal sequence of both enzymes was identical, indicating that the processing occurred most probably at the c-terminus of the enzyme. indeed, peptide mass mapping using both trypsin and asp-n in gel digestion revealed that the c-terminal tryptic peptide val <dig> - asn <dig> was present in nit-anigrec but absent in nit-anigwt. more specifically, the asp-n generated peptide asp298-val <dig> detected in the recombinant protein was shortened to asp298-arg <dig> in the native enzyme. these results provide evidence that nit-anigwt was shortened by  <dig> amino acid residues at the c-terminus, and is composed of met <dig> - arg <dig> of amino acid sequence coded by the corresponding nitrilase gene.

preparation of homogeneous enzyme for structural studies
electron microscopy study of nit-anigrec showed heterogeneous population of particles of different shapes from nearly isometric ones in size of about  <dig> nm to elongated ones reaching over  <dig> nm in length. additionally, smaller particles of different shapes and some bigger clusters were also observed . however, long filamentous structures typical for nit-anigwt  <cit>  were not observed in this sample. despite the limited ability of nit-anigrec to form the aforementioned filamentous structures, the purified enzyme was not suitable for structural studies or protein crystallography. the refolded protein  also still exhibited some molecular heterogeneity as revealed by electron microscopy . though the gel-filtration chromatography fractionated the refolded enzyme as a single major peak , peak fronting and the appearance of a minor peak preceding the major one suggested that a small part of the enzyme aggregated into higher-molecular weight species . after a 1-month storage of the major-peak protein fraction at 4°c, this aggregation occurred again, as well as a notable shift of the molecular mass of the enzyme towards lower values . after removing the aggregated form, the rest of the enzyme remained rather stable, since after  <dig> more days of storage under the same conditions, fewer aggregates could be observed, without any further change in enzyme size . nevertheless, even after such "maturation" in enzyme quaternary structure, the enzyme was composed of a rather heterogeneous mixture of molecular forms, which were separated by gel filtration and examined by electron microscopy . in the early eluting fractions the enzyme occurred in the form of short tubes and was rather heterogeneous, whereas the late eluting fractions contained the enzyme in more homogeneous forms .

data obtained from sedimentation velocity analysis of the latter fractions  suggested a rather broad mass distribution of sedimenting species with values of apparent sedimentation coefficients ranging between  <dig> and 30s, the majority  of particles falling between  <dig> and 22s, in 95% confidence level. integration of size distribution for the main particle fraction yielded a weight average sedimentation coefficient s* =  <dig>  ±  <dig> s  and a frictional coefficient ratio f/f <dig> =  <dig>  corresponding to a moderately elongated particle. global analysis of sedimentation equilibrium data  resulted in weight average particle mass of  <dig> ±  <dig> kda in 95% confidence level, with almost no observable tendency to aggregate in the time course of the experiment . based on the value of sedimentation coefficient, frictional coefficient ratio and observed particle mass, the size and shape of the majority of particles was estimated as  <dig> ×  <dig> ±  <dig> nm and this correlates with electron microscopy . taking into account the theoretical molar mass of nitrilase monomer is  <dig> kda, we can conclude that majority of observed nitrilase oligomers was composed of  <dig> ±  <dig> nitrilase subunits, as deduced from a combination of data from sds electrophoresis, gel filtration, electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, although higher oligomers were still present in significant amount.

in agreement with the results obtained by other techniques, dls  measurements  confirmed the gradual decrease in size in the above protein fractions starting with  <dig>  nm oligomers  down to particles having a diameter of about  <dig>  nm . all fractions analysed by dls  are polydisperse with a polydispersity index  in the range  <dig> - <dig>  with equal data quality. fractions with the lowest pdi correspond to the second half of the gel filtration peak. the smallest particle size and the highest homogeneity make these fractions most suitable for further analyses including prospective protein crystallization attempts.

homology modelling and molecular dynamics
a blast search identified five proteins with relevant known structures: the nitfhit protein from caenorhabditis elegans   <cit> ; hypothetical protein ph <dig> from pyrococcus horikoshii   <cit> ; nit <dig> protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae   <cit> ; the pyrimidine degrading enzyme from drosophila melanogaster   <cit>  and mouse nitrilase- <dig>   <cit>  with corresponding identities of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 22%. although the percentage of identity is at the lower threshold for homology modelling, 3d alignment with the sheba plug-in in yasara showed a high conservation of secondary structure elements among the selected templates, thus supporting the attempt to at least obtain a useful low-resolution homology model. the c-terminal part  was modelled based on the crystal structure of kinesin from rattus norvegicus   <cit>  using residues 136- <dig> as a template, as this part has been lost in hydrolases. figure  <dig> shows a structure-based multiple sequence alignment of nitrilase from aspergillus niger with selected templates and sequences of previously published homology models of nitrilases from r. rhodochrous j <dig>  <cit>   and pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit>  . secondary structure is given as assigned by procheck  <cit> . figure 4a shows a view of the enzyme with the catalytic domain on the left and the active site in the domain center. the three long loops at the entrance of the active site are interesting features of the modelled structure. loops including the residues that correspond to 236- <dig> and 55- <dig> between β <dig> and α <dig> and 236- <dig> between β10-β <dig>  in the primary sequence were found in just one template structure, 2vhh, but these residues were not resolved in the crystal structure  <cit> . a loop corresponding to 196- <dig> between β <dig> and α <dig>  was not found in any template structure . the nitrilase from rhodococcus rhodochrous j <dig>  <cit>  presents similar residues at the corresponding primary sequence positions, and similar external loops in its homology model. the nitrilase from pseudomonas fluorescens lacks the insertion at the position similar to 196- <dig> but it has one additional loop between β <dig> and α <dig> 

a docking attempt in autodock, using benzonitrile as the substrate, found a position in the centre of the enzyme with the lowest binding energy, and thus the highest affinity. this position involved the predicted triad of active residues , demonstrating the basic correctness of the modelled structure.

the geometrical parameters of spiral structures obtained from electron microscopy were used to draft a plausible multimeric arrangement. the electron micrographs corresponded in size and general shape to helical segments made up of dimers . hereby, taking into account the size and shape of the monomeric model, approximately  <dig> subunits would be organized in a spiral or helical arrangement and  <dig> dimers would form one helical turn that could be extended in both directions . similar loops are found at the c-surface in the helical-like form of the nitrilase from r. rhodochrous  <cit> . 14- <dig> subunits in the multimeric structure can be assumed for the aliphatic nitrilase from r. rhodochrous k <dig>  <cit>  which has an identity of 42% with the nitrilase from a. niger k <dig> 

comparison of reaction optima, substrate specificity, selectivity and stability of the heterologously expressed nitrilase and the nitrilase isolated from the native organism
the optimal reaction conditions of nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt were different. nit-anigrec exhibited a lower temperature optimum  when assayed after 10-min reaction time. its activity decreased to  <dig> and 4% at  <dig> and 50°c, respectively, while nit-anigwt retained significant activity up to 55°c. the ph-range of nit-anigrec  was slightly shifted towards lower values compared to that of nit-anigwt .

nit-anigrec, incubated for  <dig> h at  <dig>   <dig> and 50°c, exhibited a residual activity >  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively. its stability was thus lower than that of nit-anigwt, which still exhibited  <dig>   <dig> and 6% of the maximum activity after 1-h incubation at  <dig>   <dig> and 55°c, respectively. the effects of various additives on nit-anigrec activity were similar to those reported for the nit-anigwt  <cit> . p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, hg2+, ag+ and al3+ ions completely abolished the activity of both preparations.

the relative activities of nit-anigwt decreased in the order 4-cyanopyridine > benzonitrile > 3-chlorobenzonitrile > 4-chlorobenzonitrile > phenylacetonitrile > 3-cyanopyridine > 2-cyanopyridine >> 2-phenylpropionitrile. in contrast, the best substrate of nit-anigrec was 2-cyanopyridine, followed by 3-cyanopyridine and 3-chlorobenzonitrile . thus 2-cyanopyridine was the only substrate for which nit-anigrec exhibited a similar or higher activity  compared to nit-anigwt . other substrates were transformed at very low rates or not transformed at all. in nit-anigrec, the production of amide by-product was most significant with 2-cyanopyridine . nevertheless, this was much less than with nit-anigwt, which gave a product consisting of up to 88% picolinamide. from the other substrates tested, the recombinant nitrilase produced only a maximum of 5% amide in the total product, in contrast to the enzyme isolated from the native organism producing high amounts of amides also from 4-chlorobenzonitrile and 4-cyanopyridine .

enzyme activity was assayed as described in methods. the specific activities of nit-anigwt and nit-anigrec for their best substrates 4-cyanopyridine  and 2-cyanopyridine , respectively, were taken as 100%. data represent the mean of four independent measurements with relative standard deviation values <5%.

all the compounds tested as potential stabilizers of the nitrilase  improved the nit-anigrec stability to a significant extent during either incubation at 38°c or repeated freezing/thawing cycles . without any stabilizer, the enzyme retained about  <dig> and 60% of its initial activity, respectively, but full activity was preserved in the presence of 1% glycine as the most powerful stabilizer. the combined action of freezing/thawing  and 3-h incubation at 45°c decreased nitrilase activity by >90% . however, the same treatment in the presence of glycine, d-sorbitol, xylitol or glucose  allowed a 4-5-fold higher enzyme activity recovery . a mixture of glycine and ammonium sulfate proved to be most efficient, enhancing the final activity by nearly a factor of  <dig> compared to the control without stabilizer.

potential stabilizers were pre-incubated with the enzyme  for  <dig> min  or added to enzyme solutions of the same protein concentration, which were then frozen and thawed  <dig> times . the enzyme activity was assayed as described in methods. the specific activity in the presence of  <dig> %  glycine  was used as the reference value. data represent the mean of four independent measurements with relative standard deviation values <5%.

discussion
a large number of putative nitrilase and cyanide hydratase sequences are contained within the whole genomic sequences of fungi. as far as we know, none of the sequenced fungal nitrilases which were predicted to act on organic nitriles have been characterized, contrary to the situation with the fungal cyanide hydratases. likewise, no sequence data have been available for the characterized nitrilases from fusarium solani imi <dig>  <cit>  and fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis  <cit> . only recently have partial amino acid sequences been identified in the nitrilases from fusarium solani o <dig>  <cit>  and fusarium solani imi <dig>  <cit> , the latter enzyme being probably different from that previously characterized in the same strain  <cit> .

the putative nitrilases of the aspergillus genus can be roughly divided into two groups, which share a relatively low degree of amino acid identity   <cit> . one of these groups is closely related to cyanide hydratases  and the a. niger k <dig> nitrilase was shown to be a member of this group. the high tendency of this enzyme to form amides from nitriles  <cit>  is in accordance with its evolutionary relationship to cyanide hydratases, the reaction product of which is formamide  <cit> .

the heterologous expression of the enzyme in e. coli bl21-gold led to a notable increase in enzyme productivity  under optimized conditions, which was fifteen times higher than in the native producer . the potential to synthesize the active enzyme may be even higher in the heterologous producer as indicated by the high ratio of nitrilase to other cellular proteins. however, the output of nit-anitrec production was lessened by the low specific activity of the enzyme . when the productivity of nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt was compared using the preferred substrate of the former enzyme, 2-cyanopyridine, that of the heterologous host was three orders of magnitude higher than that of the native producer.

in comparison with nit-anigwt, nit-anigrec produced a lower percentage of amide in total product from all substrates tested. with 2-cyanopyridine, the major products of the reaction were different, that is picolinic acid  and picolinamide  with the nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt, respectively. picolinic acid is an intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals such as local anaesthetics. nitrilases with satisfactory activities towards 2-cyanopyridine have rarely been reported. the best activity for this compound  was reported in the thermostable nitrilase from bacillus pallidus dac <dig>  <cit> . this was much less than the activity determined for nit-anigrec .

nit-anigrec was less stable than the nit-anigwt but this drawback could be overcome by using some low-molecular-weight compounds or bovine serum albumin. these compounds, known collectively as osmolytes, have been recognized as efficient agents in protein stabilization  <cit> . of the compounds tested, glycine  was most efficient for the a. niger k <dig> nitrilase. glycine and related compounds  were described as powerful agents able to protect proteins against thermal unfolding  <cit> .

nitrilases forming spiral structures differ from their nonspiral-forming homologs by two insertions of between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, and a c-terminal extension of up to  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . recently, detailed structural reconstructions using electron microscopy and molecular modelling reported that the formation of spiral helices in the natively produced nitrilases may be related to the removal of  <dig> c-terminal amino acids from the wild-type protein  <cit> . this post-translational modification was postulated to be due to autocatalytic activity of this enzyme. the approx. 4-kda difference in molecular weights of nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt suggested that a similar-sized peptide was cleaved in the latter enzyme. this assumption was verified by mass spectroscopic analysis, indicating missing cleavage of  <dig> amino acid residues at the c-terminus of nit-anigrec. the r. rhodochrous nitrilase consisting of full-length subunits was unable to form filamentous structures, which were reported for the post-translationally modified enzyme  <cit> , and also for cyanide hydratase  <cit>  and cyanide dihydratase  <cit> . in accordance with these observations, nit-anigwt was to a large extent composed of tube-like structures  <cit> , while nit-anigrec exhibited a limited tendency to this arrangement.

the reason for the differences in catalytic properties  between nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt is not clear but most probably it can be ascribed to differences in the post-translational processing of the two forms of the enzyme, and its subsequent effects on the folding, subunit interaction, and oligomerization of the enzyme. a recent mutational analysis revealed a number of effects caused by deletions or mutations in the c-terminal portion of arylacetonitrilase from pseudomonas fluorescens ebc <dig>  <cit> . in this enzyme, the c-terminal deletions of up to  <dig> amino acids did not cause any differences in the catalytical properties. however, longer deletions of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids resulted in reduction of enzymatic activity, increased formation of amide, and in changes in the enantiomeric selectivity. the effects caused by c-terminal deletions could be reversed by the addition of the corresponding sequences from another nitrilase  <cit> . it appears difficult to determine what is the relation of the above changes to those caused by  <dig> amino acid difference observed in the fungal nitrilase described here, and this issue certainly deserves detailed investigations in the future. it remains also unclear if missing post-translational modification is the primary event leading to partial enzyme misfolding, or if this misfolding negatively affected the autocatalytic cleavage of the enzyme.

the changes in catalytic behaviour could be also caused by differences in quaternary structure between nit-anigrec and nit-anigwt. similarly, a small increase in activity was associated with fibre formation in cyanide dihydratase in bacillus pumilus  <cit> .

attempts to express the enzyme in a eukaryotic host  did not bring about any positive effect on the enzyme activity, which was barely detectable in the yeast cells. the effect of chaperone co-expression in e. coli was not very efficient in the heterologous expression of this enzyme either, though previous experiments suggested the importance of chaperones for the correct folding of proteins of the nitrilase superfamily. chaperones were co-purified with nitrilases from bacillus pallidus  <cit> , pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit>  and a. niger  <cit>  and also played an important role in folding d-carbamoylase  <cit> . in vitro re-folding of the enzyme from a. niger was also tested as a potential tool to improve its specific activity but did not prove successful. it appears that re-folding is not necessary for heterologous production of fungal cyanide hydratases or nitrilases as a number of them were produced as fully functional enzymes in e. coli .

as far as we know, little or nothing has been reported on the differences between heterologously expressed nitrilases and nitrilases isolated from the native organisms. this is probably because a number of known nitrilases have been purified and characterized either purely from the heterologous host or purely from the native producer. the enzyme with the highest homology to a. niger nitrilase, cyanide hydratase from a. nidulans , was only examined with a single substrate   <cit>  and not compared with the purified enzyme from the wild-type producer as far as we know. even if both enzyme forms were available in bacterial nitrilases , the enzymatic properties have rarely been compared under the same conditions. therefore, potential differences between the nitrilases isolated from the native organisms and the heterologously expressed nitrilases may have gone unnoticed. differences in biochemical properties of different nitrilase species may reflect partial misfolding of individual subunits, different post-translational modifications, but the diversity of the enzymes in terms of structural variants  may be also important in this respect.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, heterologous expression of a fungal nitrilase operating on organic nitriles was achieved in this study for the first time. the enzyme differed from that produced by the wild-type strain a. niger k <dig> in subunit molecular weight due to a missing post-translational modification . nevertheless, it may still be useful for some biocatalytic applications, and even gained some advantages over the enzyme isolated from the native organism, such as a higher hydrolytic activity for 2-cyanopyridine. purification of the enzyme from the heterologous host was straightforward, enabling tens of mg of the purified protein to be obtained for structural and activity studies. the refolded enzyme underwent changes in its oligomeric structure during storage and was finally fractionated to give a structurally almost homogeneous protein potentially useful for crystallographic nitrilase studies, which have so far been largely impaired by specific quaternary arrangement of these enzymes.
