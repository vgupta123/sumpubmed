BACKGROUND
vertebrate development is a complex, sequential process, which is guided and controlled by a large number of transcription factors acting in a spatio-temporal manner. many of these transcription factors are pleiotropic in nature, expressing and functioning in multiple tissues simultaneously. pleiotropy is a feature of some genes, which refers to the ability to affect multiple, distinct and unrelated phenotypes and has important implications in development, disease and evolution . although pleiotropy has been studied over a period of time for genes involved in various biological functions, very few in-depth molecular studies have been conducted looking at a single gene in detail covering its roles in multiple tissues and trying to understand the independent and /or overlapping molecular mechanisms involved in its disparate functions.

the mammalian homeobox gene bapx <dig>  encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the eponymous nkx <cit>  gene family ortholog of the drosophila bap gene  <cit> . during mouse embryogenesis bapx <dig> is expressed in five distinct tissues - vertebral column, spleen, gut, forelimb and hindlimb, yet appears to have a unique function in only a subset of these. bapx <dig> null mice are affected by lethal skeletal dysplasia, with severe malformation or absence of specific bones of the vertebral column and cranial bones of mesodermal origin. the most severely affected parts of the skeleton are the ventral structures, which are in close proximity to the notochord. bapx <dig> null mutants also show visceral mesoderm defects leading to asplenia . the bapx <dig> null embryos exhibit a shortened anterior gut segment and a loss of the pyloric constriction  <cit> . although bapx <dig> is expressed in the developing limbs there is no overt limb phenotype in the loss-of-function mutants but a bapx <dig> gain-of-function mouse model exhibits preaxial polydactyly and hypoplasia of the tibia  <cit> .

since bapx <dig> is expressed in five distinct tissues it was imperative to segregate these tissues as well as the specific cell type within the tissues expressing bapx <dig> for a detailed understanding of its molecular mechanism. we achieved this by targeting the bapx <dig> locus with enhanced green fluorescent protein  driven by an ires  into the 3’utr of bapx <dig> allowing for mice of a wildtype genotype expressing both bapx <dig> and egfp proteins or by inserting egfp immediately after the translational start codon of bapx <dig>  to create a null genotype. in both cases egfp was expressed under the control of endogenous bapx <dig> transcriptional regulatory elements. this enabled us to isolate specifically only cells expressing bapx <dig> from these heterogeneous tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting , and to compare the expression profiles of bapx <dig> target genes in wildtype versus loss-of-function embryos as a first step to understanding the pleiotropic roles of bapx <dig> 

it is essential when unraveling the role of a transcription factor in directing organogenesis to take the complementary and supporting roles played by other transcription factors that are active in the same cells into consideration. to understand such complementary roles we focused on the vertebral column, an organ unique to vertebrates providing body structure and support, which undergoes endochondral ossification of its cartilaginous structures to form bones. to decipher the possible molecular mechanism of chondrocyte differentiation and maturation in the vertebral column we co-analyzed the transcription factor sox <dig>  which has a major role in development and morphogenesis of chondrocytes  <cit> .

sox <dig> is a known master regulator in the osteo-chondrogenic lineage but its co-regulatory role with bapx <dig> has not been fully explored, though some evidence suggests that it lies in a regulatory cascade upstream of bapx <dig> <cit> . to explore this, we performed similar expression profiling and genome wide binding studies in the vertebral column of e <dig>  wildtype and sox <dig> null mice, to uncover its role independently, as well as decipher antagonistic and complementary co-regulatory roles between sox <dig> and bapx <dig>  by comparing unique and shared target genes. we uncovered  <dig> genes, which are regulated by both bapx <dig> and sox <dig> encompassing very different functions. finally by combining the genome wide binding and transcriptional profiling data we have generated a gene regulatory network directed by bapx <dig> and sox <dig> in the mouse vertebral column at e <dig> .

RESULTS
generation of transgenic mouse lines
with the aim of isolating bapx <dig> expressing cells by facs for in vivo comparative gene expression analysis, we targeted the endogenous bapx <dig> locus with the enhanced green fluorescent protein  reporter gene via homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem  cells, generating a bapx <dig> wildtype  and a bapx <dig> null  transgenic allele, both enabling expression of egfp under control of the endogenous bapx <dig> promoter . bapx1tm <dig> tlu was designed with the reporter linked via the internal ribosomal entry site  at the 3’ utr of the bapx <dig> locus, forming a bicistronic system with two open reading frames  . es cell targeting was verified by genomic southern blotting , offspring and embryos were genotyped by pcr . both bapx1tm <dig> tlu and bapx1tm <dig> tlu showed expression of the egfp protein in the correct bapx1-specific domains  as previously described  <cit> . the bapx1tm <dig> tlu mice were normal when compared to wildtype bapx1+/+ littermates  <cit> . similar constructs were made for the sox <dig> locus to create sox9tm <dig> tlu <cit>  and sox9-/- mice that are described in detail in another manuscript.figure  <dig>

identification of genes controlled by bapx1in five different tissues
since bapx <dig> is expressed in multiple tissues in the developing mouse embryo  <cit> , we fine dissected the five principal bapx <dig> domains prior to facs, namely: vertebral column, spleen, gut, forelimb and hindlimb . at e <dig>  the vertebrate hindlimb is slightly delayed in its development compared to the forelimb . to capture the distinct molecular events orchestrated by bapx <dig> in fore- and hindlimbs, we analyzed them separately. our microarray analysis revealed that bapx <dig> controlled very different sets of genes in all of these five organs, with little overlap between each of the five tissues. while bapx <dig> affected a large number of genes  in the spleen , gut  and vertebral column , it controlled only a very limited number of genes in the hind-  and forelimb  , an observation correlating with the of loss-of function phenotypes in spleen, gut and vertebral column and lack thereof in the limbs, although bapx <dig> is highly expressed during limb development , and bapx <dig> gain-of-function in the limbs results in polydactyly  <cit> . mostly in vitro findings indicate primarily a repressive function for bapx <dig> and in its absence one would expect increased expression of its primary target genes that it is responsible for silencing.

we then focused on the nature of the regulation by bapx <dig> in each of the three tissues with a loss-of function phenotype  where bapx <dig> obviously has an important developmental role. in two of these tissues  bapx <dig> was primarily an activator of downstream genes. we found in bapx1-specific spleen cells 77% of the genes  and in bapx1-specific gut cells 88%  of the genes showed decreased expression in the bapx <dig> null embryos. however, in the bapx1-specific vertebral column cells 91%  of the genes were increased in expression in the bapx <dig> null embryo, indicating that the bapx <dig> protein is primarily a repressor of genes during normal vertebral column development  which is consistent with the in vitro findings for bapx <dig> mentioned above.

though it is always possible in multi tissue studies that the varying levels of gene expression changes seen in different organs is a reflection of the different rate of development of each tissue, it is highly unlikely in this case specially in the spleen and limbs. spleen starts developing as a separate tissue from the surrounding pancreatic mesenchyme at around e <dig>  and the role of bapx <dig> in this organ is also important from this time point in development  <cit> . the expression of bapx <dig> in the limb is also first detected at e <dig>   <cit>  and hence we are looking at organs at comparable stages of development. the expression of bapx <dig> in both gut and vertebral column is first detected at e <dig>   <cit>  and comparable numbers of genes are changing in the bapx <dig> null embryo at the stage under investigation. it is also noteworthy that almost  <dig> times more genes are changing in spleen compared to the gut or vertebral column pointing to the fact that correlation between developmental stage and impact of the loss of transcription factor in an organ can be at times tenuous.

bapx1represses inappropriate early maturation of chondrocytes
bapx <dig> prevents early maturation of chondrocytes in the vertebral column and its role in vertebral column development is its most studied function. the bapx <dig> null embryos die at birth exhibiting a truncated axial skeleton owing to the absence of ossification centers in the vertebrae, lack of cartilage condensations and a markedly reduced intervertebral disc formation . during chondrogenesis, bapx <dig> is considered to primarily suppress the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes  <cit> , but the genes it regulates pertaining to this function are poorly understood. during endochondral ossification, mesenchymal cells of the condensation differentiate into chondrocytes, marked by their ability to secrete collagen ii, ix, xi and aggrecan, while repressing collagen type i production. upon chondrocyte maturation, proliferation of the chondrocytes stops and they progress to hypertrophy, marked by the switch to the production of type x collagen instead of type ii. terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes then secrete matrix metalloproteinases to degrade the cartilage matrix, facilitating vascular invasion that brings in osteoprogenitors for ossification  <cit> .

during early axial skeleton development the somite segmentation proceeds from rostral to caudal  <cit> . gene ontology  analysis of data from e <dig>  embryos using “database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery”   <cit>  revealed enrichment of cartilage condensation/development and neuron development genes. from this, it was evident that bapx <dig> controls key genes in cartilage development like uncx, chad, ctgf and wwp <dig>  we observed down-regulation of these transcripts in the rostral vertebral column of bapx1-null embryos by in situ hybridization . thus bapx <dig> impacts the level of expression of some chondrogenic genes, but is dispensable for their initiation of transcription. furthermore, bapx <dig> positively regulates sox <dig>  which regulates extra cellular matrix genes typical for early chondrocyte differentiation like col2a <dig> and acan, in conjunction with sox <dig> and sox <dig> <cit> . in this way, bapx <dig> indirectly regulates early chondrocyte differentiation.figure  <dig>

at the same time bapx <dig> suppresses neural differentiation by inhibiting genes like alcam, ntrk <dig>  corin and dcx and prevents premature osteogenesis by inhibiting osteoblast marker , cartilage degradation genes with metallopeptidase activity  and prevents blood vessel development by inhibiting klf <dig>  vegfc and nrp <dig>  . correspondingly, ingenuity pathway analysis  analysis showed enrichment of genes in the wnt and vegf signaling pathways, as well as the inhibition of matrix metalloproteases . wnt/b-catenin signaling is known to suppress chondrogenesis, and cartilage degradation and bone matrix formation are associated with chondrocyte maturation  <cit> . this points out that bapx <dig>  which largely functions as a repressor in the vertebral column, does not regulate the early differentiation of chondrocytes as much as it represses the inappropriate early maturation of these chondrocytes.

bapx1controls cell survival in the spleen
bapx <dig> has a strong effect on spleen morphogenesis given the bapx <dig> null embryos are asplenic at birth . the underlying mechanism for this phenotype was unclear as genes controlled by bapx <dig> were previously largely unknown. our transcriptional profiling of bapx <dig> specific spleen cells at e <dig>  showed that wildtype bapx <dig> is an activator of a large number of genes involved in cell division and cell cycle like bmi <dig>  cdc14a, cep <dig>  ccng <dig>  lats <dig>  ccne <dig>  top <dig>  stag <dig>  tfdp <dig> and ckap <dig> . moreover, nkx <dig> , a known spleen anlage marker and a regulator of spleen growth through the inhibition of cell cycle inhibitor p <dig>  was one of the targets in bapx <dig> null embryos showing loss of expression  <cit> . pdx <dig>  another spleen development marker is also known to regulate nkx <dig> . bapx <dig> regulates nkx <dig>  as well, yet without affecting pdx <dig> itself, indicating the possible presence of a parallel pathway that converges at nkx <dig>  to regulate proliferation of splenic primordial cells  <cit> . it is further possible that pdx <dig> is upstream of bapx <dig> and mediates nkx <dig>  via bapx <dig>  besides nkx <dig> , slc40a <dig> and bmi <dig> were activated by wildtype bapx <dig> and the loss-of function mouse mutants of these genes exhibit a hypoplastic spleen phenotype. functional ablation of slc40a <dig> <cit>  results in increased splenocyte apoptosis while bmi <dig> is a cell cycle regulator, which shows impaired splenocyte proliferation upon knock-out  <cit> , suggesting that these genes also mediate the cell viability function of bapx <dig> in the spleen.

ipa analysis predicted the proliferation of cells to be decreased  while apoptotic genes were enriched  . in situ hybridization showed the presence of remnant splenic primordial mesenchyme at e <dig>  in bapx1-null embryos, which is progressively lost with development, resulting in asplenia at birth . thus, the disruption of cell survival via the deregulation of cell cycle and apoptotic genes in the splenic primordial mesenchyme is likely causative for the hypoplasia of the spleen at e <dig>  and its complete absence at later developmental stages in the bapx <dig> null mutants. ipa further revealed the enrichment of genes of the fgf signaling pathway, a pathway essential for cell survival, cell growth, differentiation, morphogenesis and angiogenesis. other enriched genes included members of the erk/mapk signaling, epithelial adherens junction signaling, vegf signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways .

validation of novel bapx1target genes during spleen development
we confirmed two genes with no previously attributed role in spleen development by section rna in-situ hybridization . kinase  anchor protein   <dig>  previously described in the pancreas  <cit>  was shown here to be expressed and controlled by bapx <dig> in the spleen . similarly glycogenin  previously described in the heart and lungs  <cit> , was found to be expressed and controlled by bapx <dig> in the spleen as seen by a significant decrease in expression in the e <dig>  day bapx <dig> null spleen . the entire repertoire of genes regulated by bapx <dig> in the spleen would thus serve as a suitable database of splenic development genes for future investigation.

bapx1controls enzyme inhibitors and viability in the gut cells
bapx <dig> is the mammalian ortholog of the drosophila bagpipe, a gene that is essential for directing the development of the fly visceral mesoderm into gut musculature  <cit> . in contrast, bapx <dig> does not seem as critical during morphogenesis of the mammalian gut, given most of the previous knock-out studies failed to report a significant gut phenotype, except for a shortening of the antrum-pylorus segment and the loss of the pyloric constriction . bapx <dig> expressing cells are reportedly present in the gut mesenchyme with a rostral boundary in the hind stomach, near the junction of the gastric corpus and antrum  <cit> . by analyzing genes under the control of bapx <dig> we defined its potential role in the gastrointestinal tract. our go annotation of genes clearly indicated that bapx <dig> primarily controls genes involved in endopeptidase and other enzyme inhibitor activities . these include kngi, ambp, serpina1b, serpinaa <dig>  spink <dig> and itih <dig> among others. in analogy to the spleen our ipa analysis revealed that bapx <dig> regulates a significant proportion of proliferation  and apoptotic genes  in the gut, thus explaining the shortening of the antrum-pylorus segment in the null embryo . our genome wide transcriptional profiling revealed genes previously unknown to be controlled by bapx <dig> in the gut and the control of a physiological activity  that has not been attributed to it previously. furthermore, signaling pathways such as erk/mapk signaling, vegf signaling and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway were enriched in the gut similar to our observations in the spleen .

bapx1-sox9act synergistically in the developing vertebral column
previous in vitro analyses showed bapx <dig> and sox <dig> connect in an auto-regulatory loop and sox <dig> repressing runx <dig> via bapx <dig>  thereby preventing the inappropriate hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes  <cit> . hence we investigated the regulatory targets of sox <dig> in the developing e <dig>  vertebral column in vivo. similar to our work regarding bapx <dig>  we enriched for sox9-specific cells from the vertebral column of sox9+/tm <dig> tlu and sox9-/- e <dig>  embryos using facs . our microarray data on the sox9-specific cells revealed that the sox <dig> protein, unlike bapx <dig>  is neither an overt activator nor a repressor of transcription in the vertebrate column as  <dig> %  genes showed decreased expression  compared to  <dig> %  showing increased expression  in the sox <dig> null embryo relative to the sox <dig> wildtype embryo . ipa of these sox <dig> controlled genes revealed that most had known roles in chondrocyte differentiation , proliferation  and apoptosis   consistent with the known role of sox <dig> as a master regulator of osteo-chondrogenesis. though many of the downstream genes are known to be involved in chondrogenesis through in vitro studies, our data demonstrates that sox <dig> regulates these genes in vivo in the developing mouse embryo at e <dig> , a time when the developing skeleton is transitioning from mesenchymal condensations to a chondrogenic framework. similar to the pathways regulated by bapx <dig> in the vertebral column, ipa analysis for sox <dig> regulated genes showed enrichment of the wnt/b-catenin and vegf signaling pathways, and the inhibition of matrix metalloproteases .

with bapx <dig> and sox <dig> functioning in the same tissue and regulating similar pathways, the question arose whether these two transcription factors act on the same set of genes in a co-regulatory manner. comparing sox <dig> controlled gene expression with bapx <dig> target genes allowed us to filter for chondrogenic genes, as bapx <dig> is naturally absent in the neural tube. we focused on three sets of genes:  common genes that are activated by sox <dig> but repressed by bapx <dig>   genes repressed by both and  genes activated by both. for analysis of gene co-regulated by sox <dig> and bapx <dig> we have used a cut off of fc <dig>  to make a larger gene set to avoid overlooking any gene which might be strongly regulated by one and weakly by other. we found  <dig> genes to be repressed by bapx <dig> and activated by sox <dig> all primarily involved in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation like gbx <dig>  dbx, nrn <dig> and ctnna <dig> .figure  <dig>

analyzing genes repressed by both transcription factors in the vertebral column, we found  <dig> genes, which included the osteogenic factor col1a <dig>  cartilage degrading metalloproteases  and most highly enriched, genes controlling blood vessel development , an essential process during chondrocyte maturation  <cit>  . though the role of sox <dig> as a repressor of cartilage vascularization has been shown recently  <cit> , our data suggests that bapx <dig> plays an equally critical role in this process. thus by repressing these genes at an early time point in development it prevents premature ossification of the developing vertebral column. moreover, bapx <dig> and sox <dig> function as activators on only six common target genes, including sox <dig>  wwp <dig>  chad and ctgf, which are all known to be involved in cartilage development  .

surprisingly, we did not detect bapx <dig> as one of the downstream targets of sox <dig> or vice versa at e <dig>  in the vertebral column . however, we found sox <dig> to be downstream of bapx <dig> in the spleen and gut tissue. besides, bapx <dig> was clearly upregulated in the bapx1-null embryos in the vertebral column , indicating potential auto-regulation.

genome wide binding of bapx <dig> and sox <dig> proteins to dna target sites in the vertebral column
the pool of differentially expressed genes from the expression profiling consisted of target genes that were regulated directly by bapx <dig> and sox <dig>  and indirect target genes whose expression was altered owing to the loss of these two transcription factors affecting their upstream regulators . to find genes directly controlled by bapx <dig> and sox <dig> proteins during vertebral chondrogenesis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  on vertebral columns dissected from e <dig>  embryos. for sox <dig>  we performed chip-seq with an anti-sox <dig> antibody. however for bapx <dig>  owing to the absence of a suitable chip grade quality bapx <dig> antibody, a mouse line with a s-peptide and calmodulin binding peptide  epitope tagged to bapx <dig> at its n-terminus was generated  similar to other work we have described . s-peptide is a  <dig> amino acid tag and cbp is a  <dig> amino acid tag, routinely used for protein purification purposes  and owing to their small size suitable for endogenous tagging of transcription factors in the mouse  <cit> . their absence from the wildtype mouse proteome allows for highly specific chip. the homozygous bapx <dig> protein tagged mice we generated were phenotypically normal compared to their wildtype littermates, assuring normal biological activity of the tagged protein and thus allowed us to use the s-peptide antibody to pull down tagged bapx <dig> figure  <dig>

using the model-based analysis for chip-seq  algorithm  <cit>  we detected  <dig> bapx <dig> peaks with 19%  of the binding sites located on the transcription start sites  of genes . interestingly a large proportion of the binding sites were distal from the tss, with 37%  located at >25 kb distally in the intergenic region and 26%  located >25 kb in the intragenic regions . likewise for sox <dig>  we identified  <dig> peaks. similar to bapx <dig>  most of the binding sites were located distal to the tss, with only ~ 10%  of the sox <dig> binding sites at the tss of various genes and 66%  of the binding sites more than 25 kb distal to the tss . this shows that in midgestation embryos, critical transcription factors like bapx <dig> and sox <dig> tend to bind primarily to distal regulatory elements in order to direct downstream gene expression in target cells and tissues rather than activating transcription at the tss. to ascertain which are potential bapx <dig> direct targets in the vertebral column we looked at genes that are differentially expressed  in the microarray dataset for the vertebral column and discovered that of all the genes that have a binding site within 100 kb of their tss 84% are up-regulated in the bapx1-null. this adds confidence to the data that the bapx <dig> protein primarily acts as repressor in the vertebral column .

we identified the previously reported bapx <dig> binding motif tagtg  <cit> , enriched in about 40% of the bapx <dig> binding sites in the genome  specifically near genes controlling cartilage and bone morphogenesis . notably, this motif was reported to be involved in chondrogenesis in vitro, in cell culture and chicken embryo explant assays  <cit> . our data is the first to demonstrate the in vivo binding of bapx <dig> to genomic dna by this motif in mouse embryo chondrogenic cells. we further validated the bapx <dig> binding motif by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays  with four randomly selected genomic regions containing this motif . this allowed us to test the binding specificity of the motif in its native context. all four of the randomly chosen genomic regions containing the motif were able to bind bapx <dig> in vitro . to further confirm the specificity of the motif, we mutated all the nucleotides of the core sequence of one of the regions by transversion and noted a complete abrogation of binding . we ascertained the specificity of this binding of the probe to bapx <dig> using a supershift assay. we generated nih3t <dig> cells overexpressing v5-tagged bapx <dig> and used an anti-v <dig> antibody on nuclear extract for specificity and an anti-flag antibody as a non-specific control. our results showed a supershift with the anti-v <dig> antibody, whereas the addition of anti-flag antibody had no effect on the shift . we further analyzed if some of the bapx <dig> bound regions could act as enhancers in a transactivation assay using a luciferase reporter. we cloned seven randomly selected genomic regions   in a minimal promoter driven luciferase vector  and co-transfected it with the v5-tagged bapx <dig> vector into nih3t <dig> cell lines. five out of the seven regions showed activity over the basal level thus acting as an enhancer. to further test if the core-binding motif for bapx <dig> was necessary and sufficient for this activity we used mutated oligonucleotides for the core sequence in two of the regions. the mutated oligonucleotides failed to drive expression over the basal level, thus proving that the core bapx <dig> motif is the essential component of these enhancers . similarly, most of the genes nearest to the sox <dig> binding regions were involved in chondrogenesis, validating the specificity of the data . we also identified the dna binding motif for sox <dig> caag that had been previously identified mostly by in vitro studies . our data shows that sox <dig> binds near genes involved in chondrogenesis in the developing mouse embryo by this same motif.

direct co-regulation by bapx <dig> and sox <dig> in the vertebral column
next we established how many of the genes in these groups have binding sites for both transcription factors within 200 kb of their tss. of the group of genes activated by sox <dig> and repressed by bapx <dig>  86%  had both the bapx <dig> and sox <dig> binding sites within 200 kb of their tss . these genes represent potential primary targets of bapx <dig> and sox <dig>  which are under opposite regulatory pressure in the vertebral column to maintain a distinct neuronal and osteo-chondrogenic identity in the developing embryo, they include genes like gata <dig>  ctnna <dig>  nrn <dig> and dcx, whose knockouts have a reported neuronal phenotype  but have never been associated with a regulation by either sox <dig> or bapx <dig>  our dataset thus connects bapx <dig> and sox <dig> downstream genes with a dual regulatory mechanism. similarly, 78%  of the genes repressed by both sox <dig> and bapx <dig> had binding sites for both sox <dig> and bapx <dig> within 200 kb of their tss . these genes are also potential primary targets of both sox <dig> and bapx <dig>  but repressed by both. this group includes the osteogenic, metalloproteinase and angiogenesis genes col1a <dig>  mmp <dig>  adamts <dig>  ctsk, emcn and nrp <dig>  we looked for binding sites that were overlapping for both the transcription factors but failed to find any at this stage of development. this was not entirely unexpected since both are large transcription factors with distinct motifs thus it is slightly unlikely they could occupy a single enhancer without causing steric hindrance at the same time in development.

our results show that combining genome wide data for binding and transcriptional profiling of two critical transcription factors  in a single organ can lead to a detailed understanding of the diverse levels of regulation involved in its organogenesis. some neuronal genes were found under a competing control mechanism, receiving both positive and negative inputs: primarily neuronal genes and genes controlling processes essential for chondrocyte maturation were repressed in chondrocytes and those promoting chondrogenesis were activated by both bapx <dig> and sox <dig> . finally by assembling information from all the genes regulated by bapx <dig> and sox <dig> either directly or indirectly a large-scale integrative gene regulatory network could be delineated .figure  <dig>

discussion
it is becoming increasingly clear that an in-depth understanding of organogenesis in vertebrates will require comprehensive systems biology approaches to tease out all the players in various pathways and integrate them into a mechanistic network. gene expression profiling coupled with genome wide binding studies for particular organs have over the years shed some light on these complex processes  <cit> . however, transcriptome analysis of an entire tissue or organ only gives a broad and often confusing picture of the precise transcriptional changes taking place during development owing to a large heterogeneity of different cell types that comprise individual tissues that make up a functional organ. by conducting expression profiling only on cells that express a particular set of transcription factors we generated a highly focused dataset elucidating pleiotropic roles played by the transcription factors in organogenesis.

we have analyzed five different organs expressing the bapx <dig> gene to explain the disparate roles it plays in each of them. although the pleiotropic role of bapx <dig> was known and many phenotypes defined, our approach is the first large-scale effort looking at all the major tissues expressing bapx <dig>  this allowed us to make connections between many new genes previously unknown to be controlled by bapx <dig>  the large scale dataset generated enabled us to place these genes within pathways they control, essentially explaining the lack of a limb phenotype, the absence of an overt morphological phenotype in the gut and the impact on cell cycle regulation in the spleen leading to asplenia in the bapx <dig> loss-of-function mice. importantly, bapx <dig> largely regulates different genes and pathways in the different tissues to execute its pleiotropic roles. interestingly, spleen and gut tissue, which are closely associated during gastrointestinal development  <cit>  share more similar pathways with each other than with vertebral column tissue. indeed, among the five tissues, spleen and gut share the most number of common genes. intriguingly, while bapx <dig> represses vegf signaling in the vertebral column and gut, it is largely activated in the spleen. the spleen is a repository of red blood cells and its development involves vascularization that allows the infiltration of lymphoid progenitors as early as e <dig> -e <dig>   <cit> . hence, positive regulation of angiogenesis in the spleen is not too surprising. at the same time, consistent with its role in preventing premature endochondral ossification, bapx <dig> inhibits vegf signaling in the vertebral column.

the formation of gene regulatory networks in vertebrate development continues to be a long arching goal of developmental biology. yet, to establish such detailed maps, many times input from more than one transcription factor is required. hence, we co-analyzed in similar fashion cells specific for sox <dig>  another key transcription factor during chondrogenesis and vertebral column development. combining the genes regulated by bapx <dig> and sox <dig> in the vertebral column we have generated a network of genes activated and/or repressed by these transcription factors during the fine tuned process of organogenesis. we have identified  <dig> genes co-regulated by these two transcription factors providing insight into some of the mechanisms employed during chondrocyte maturation; there is a group of neuronal genes, which are acted upon antagonistically by bapx <dig> and sox <dig>  chondrogenic differentiation genes which are activated by both sox <dig> and bapx <dig>  and a group of genes which are repressed by both sox <dig> and bapx <dig> that are involved in processes essential for hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. furthermore, bapx <dig> and sox <dig> contribute to several similar pathways during vertebral column development, especially the repression of osteogenic differentiation and cartilage degradation. we also studied the genome wide binding of bapx <dig> and sox <dig> in vertebral column tissue to identify potential primary target genes. our chip-seq data revealed that although bapx <dig> and sox <dig> bound to the tss of some genes, the majority of the genes regulated by these two transcription factors had their binding sites distal to the tss, highlighting the fact that during the midgestation development in mouse embryos many critical transcription factors bind to distal cis-regulatory elements.

CONCLUSIONS
in all we have managed to create a comprehensive list of genes controlled by a single transcription factor namely bapx <dig> from five different tissues, explaining its diverse roles and the various genetic pathways bapx <dig> contributes to. this is the first study analyzing all major bapx <dig> dependent organs in molecular detail and providing explanations for the phenotypes observed in the loss-of-function animals. many of the here identified target genes were previously unknown to be either directly or indirectly regulated by bapx <dig> owing to a lack of feasible strategies for determining downstream effectors on a genome wide scale. this genomic resource and the underlying mechanisms uncovered will form the basis for a deeper understanding of the complex process of organogenesis in the developing mammalian embryo.
