BACKGROUND
eristalis tenax belongs to the hover flies, family syrphidae , with more than  <dig>  described species, which occurred late in evolution and radiated in the early tertiary  <cit> . in contrast to the predominantly flower-feeding habitats of adult syrphids, their maggots are found in a very diverse array of habitats. those of subfamily eristalinae are saprophagous, coprophagous and aquatic filterfeeders. combined analysis of molecular and morphological characters supports both frequent shifts between larval feeding habitats within the eristalinae and the monophyly of this subfamily  <cit> . the rat-tailed maggots of e. tenax are characterized by their extended anal breathing tube that functions as a snorkel and enables survival in waters with anaerobic conditions. they realize a unique ecological niche by preferably living in stagnant aquatic environments with high organic and microbial contamination. because of the preference of e. tenax larvae for dirty waters with anaerobic conditions, they are reliable and prominent indicators in the biological assessment of water quality for extremely high pollution with organic material  <cit> . they thus represent a suitable model to investigate the trade-offs between the benefits resulting from colonization of habitats lacking predators, parasitoids, or competitors and the investment in immunity against microbial stress.

the innate immunity of insects relies on immediate processes including cellular phagocytosis, encapsulation, hemolymph coagulation, and phenoloxidase activation leading to melanization. on the other hand sustainable defense is achieved by the massive synthesis of antimicrobial peptides like defensins and cecropins  <cit> . insect immunity has been best analyzed in the fruit fly d. melanogaster  <cit> , but results of comparative genome-wide analysis of immunity-related genes in d. melanogaster, anopheles gambiae, and aedes aegypti reveal that effector molecules from these dipteran species exhibit large variations  <cit> . for example, four defensin and four cecropin genes exist in anopheles, making these more numerous than in drosophila whereas some antimicrobial peptides that were identified in drosophila are absent in anopheles and aedes  <cit> . the maggots of e. tenax have been recognized to be particularly resistant to microbial stress, because they are able to survive in aquatic habitats that are usually not colonized by other dipteran larvae or animals  <cit> . hence we were interested to identify the immune-related genes of this insect.

to selectively identify immune-induced genes we used the subtractive suppression hybridization  method which amplifies differentially expressed cdnas and simultaneously suppresses amplification of common cdnas. this technique has been proven as a suitable tool for identification of immune-related genes in insects  <cit>  and other invertebrates  <cit> . here, we report analysis of the immune-inducible transcriptome of e. tenax maggots, collected from storage pits of liquid manure. this enabled identification of genes encoding novel proteins that are potentially involved in pathogen-recognition and immune signaling. in addition, we identified numerous potential antimicrobial peptides that most probably contribute to the observed immune defense that is obviously important to control the wide array of pathogens present in the habitat of eristalis larvae.

RESULTS
subtracted cdna library of immune challenged e. tenax larvae
we observed a significant e. coli inhibitory activity of hemolymph samples from untreated e. tenax larvae that further increases upon immune challenge . in order to construct a subtracted cdna library enriched in immune-inducible genes we used purified rna from lps injected and untreated animals combined with a pcr-based ssh method. to induce strong and broad immune responses we injected a commercially available purified lps preparation, which is known to contain impurities like nucleic acids, proteins and peptidoglycans, and which according to the supplier is commonly used as elicitor of immune responses in vertebrates and invertebrates. in order to confirm that the subtraction process has been performed efficiently, we analyzed the abundance of transcripts for the house-keeping gene α-tubulin and for two genes, the et-amp <dig> and eristalin. the latter ones were found in the present study to be induced in response to immune challenge in eristalis. quantitative real-time pcr analyses revealed that transcripts of α-tubulin were reduced  <dig> fold, whereas transcripts of et-amp <dig> and eristalin were enriched for  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively . this is in agreement with values from the protocols of the manufacturer and indicates successful subtraction of the cdna library. a total of  <dig> clones were randomly picked and subjected to colony pcr. plasmids of  <dig> colonies that were positively screened in blot hybridization, indicating induced expression in response to lps challenge, were isolated and sequenced. the sequences obtained  were deposited at embl european bioinformatics institute, and compared to databases of the national center for biotechnology information using the program blastx. interproscan at the embl european bioinformatics institute was used for an integrated search in prosite, pfam and prints databases in order to predict conserved motifs, signal sequences and transmembrane regions.

1nsm, no significant match

we describe here the identification of immune-inducible proteins in e. tenax that are potentially involved in recognition of microbes, immune-related signaling, and antimicrobial effector mechanisms.

sensing of infection
innate immunity depends on pathogen recognition that is mainly mediated by host proteins called pattern recognition receptors. in insects, two prominent members, the gram-negative binding proteins  and peptidoglycan recognition proteins  are involved in the activation of prophenoloxidase cascade and of toll/imd pathways resulting in the massive production of immune effector molecules  <cit> . here, we identified transcripts of a protein that shares sequence similarities with pgrp-sb <dig> from several drosophila species . this peptidoglycan recognition protein  is one of a battery of pattern recognition proteins in insects that are essential for recognition of invading microbes and induction of immune responses  <cit> . drosophila and anopheles have  <dig> and  <dig> pgrp genes that are transcribed into at least  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, respectively  <cit> . mammals possess a family of  <dig> pgrps that function as both recognition proteins and effector molecules exhibiting bactericidal activities  <cit> . a bayesian protein tree  was generated with sequences from eristalis, humans, d. melanogaster, and a. gambiae and revealed that eristalis pgrp groups nearest to drosophila pgrp-sb <dig> 

signaling
we identified a protein sharing highest similarity with the relish protein of glossina morsitans morsitans . relish or nuclear factor -kappa-b p <dig> subunit is a key molecule of the imd pathway and is phosphorylated by lps-activated i-kappa-b kinase complex before being cleaved  <cit> . the relish-p <dig> subunit is cleaved within seconds after immune challenge into relish-p <dig> and relish-p <dig> subunits. the latter translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of numerous immune-related genes  <cit> . the nf-kappa-b/i-kappa-b signaling pathways are evolutionarily well conserved and widely distributed among the animal kingdom  <cit> .

many serine proteinase inhibitors have evolved in vertebrates and invertebrates to regulate vital serine proteinase cascades. these contribute to melanization and host defense responses in insects  <cit>  as well as to hemostasis, fibrinolysis, and complement system in vertebrates  <cit> . here, we identified one proteinase inhibitor that belongs to kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitors. kazal domains are characterized by a well-preserved amino acid sequence containing three disulfide bridges, and display varying specificity for serine proteinases  <cit> .

one identified cdna encodes a protein that exhibits highest sequence similarities to the replicase polyprotein of the drosophila c virus. this virus belongs to the picornavirus family  that also includes the prominent polio and foot-and-mouth disease viruses  <cit> . however, it should be mentioned here that the similarities between the sequences depends mainly on a dsrna-binding domain-like region. this region is also present in a variety of cellular rna-binding proteins with different structures and diverse functions including e.g. the human interferon-induced protein kinase  <cit> .

protein biosynthesis and cell proliferation
we identified several transcripts of factors potentially involved in eristalis protein biosynthesis including ribosomal proteins s <dig> and l <dig>  lysyl-trna synthetase, and the translation initiation factor eif5c. this is reasonable, since the massive production of antimicrobial peptides upon immune challenge depends on the activation of the cellular translation machinery in cells and tissues of the immune system  <cit> . nevertheless, one important study reported the antibacterial activity of ribosomal protein l <dig> fragment of helicobacter pylori  <cit> . additionally, park et al.  <cit>  found that lysyl-trna synthetase was secreted from intact human cells as a signaling molecule to trigger proinflammatory response by binding to macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to enhance their migration and the production of tnf-α. since lysyl-trna synthetase is highly conserved in evolution it is possible that it also serves as a signaling molecule in insects.

one transcript shared high sequence similarities with the evolutionarily conserved cellular repressor of e1a-stimulated genes . a finely-tuned balance exists between cell proliferation, cell division arrest, and apoptosis in the vertebrate immune response, and this may also be true for insects. creg is a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits cell proliferation and enhances cell differentiation  <cit> . in humans, creg was shown to bind to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor ii receptor, and this receptor has been shown to be required for creg-induced growth suppression. in insects, creg has been shown to be expressed in adult female salivary glands of a. gambiae  <cit> .

we found one transcript that exhibits similarity to the carboxyl terminus of α-tubulin from other organisms. although α-tubulin is a major constituent of microtubules and a well-known housekeeping gene, many genes and pseudogenes exist that form the α-tubulin superfamily  <cit> . induction of α-tubulin-like mrna after immune challenge has also been observed in leech  <cit> , and another study demonstrated that the dengue virus  <dig> directly binds to a  <dig> kda tubulin or tubulin-like protein of c6/ <dig> mosquito cells  <cit> . these results suggest that at least some α-tubulin-like proteins may be involved in immune responses. however, in this study α-tubulin itself was depleted by the subtraction process  suggesting that it is not immune-induced and the identified sequence may be derived from a pseudogene or related isoform.

effector molecules
the most striking finding among the genes inferred to be up-regulated in response to septic injury is the identification of numerous putative antimicrobial peptides in e. tenax. defensins have been found in a variety of animals and plants  <cit>  and even in the fungus pseudoplectania nigrella  <cit> , which is suggestive for an evolutionarily conserved role in innate immunity. in agreement, we identified an e. tenax defensin that we named eristalin. eristalin contains a predicted signal and pro-sequence and shares sequence similarities to other insect defensins . in addition, our phylogenetic analysis using sequences of eristalin and other defensin sequences from dipterans suggests that the defensins of e. tenax, s. peregrina, and s. calcitrans are more deviated in sequence. maggots of all three of this species live on feces  suggesting that independent occupation of such 'extreme' ecological niches is accompanied by divergent evolution of immune-related effector molecules.

the putative antimicrobial peptide et-amp <dig> shares highest similarities to bactenecin- <dig>  a cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide of bovine neutrophil granules that exhibits antibacterial activity predominantly against gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . bactenecin- <dig> belongs to the pro/arg-rich antibiotics  <cit>  which also include porcine pr- <dig>  <cit> , insect drosocin, abaecin, and lebocin  <cit> ; however, no homologues were identified in humans. the antibacterial effects of pro/arg-rich peptides are likely due to an impaired function of the respiratory chain and of energy-dependent activities in the inner membrane of susceptible microorganisms  <cit> .

et-amp <dig> shows high similarity to the antimicrobial tachycitin of the horseshoe crab  <cit>  and et-amp <dig> to the salivary protein sg <dig>  with as yet unknown function, from anopheles stephensi  <cit> . et-amp <dig> is a cationic peptide with putative α-helical content and with similarities to cecropins or to antimicrobial cathelicidin-derived peptides like bovine bmap- <dig>  <cit> . et-amp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are putatively disulfide-bridged cationic peptides, while et-amp <dig> is a putatively disulfide bridged anionic peptide. none share similarities with any known proteins or peptides but all exhibit lys/arg clusters in the proximity of hydrophobic clusters; this is typical for many antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

we also identified four isoforms  of glycine-rich peptides with a glycine content of over 20% . the list of glycine-rich antimicrobial peptides is rapidly growing and includes prominent members like the antifungal holotricin- <dig> from the chafer holotrichia diomphalia  <cit> , the antibacterial acanthoscurrin from the spider acanthoscurria gomesiana  <cit> , and the antibacterial armadillidin from the crustacean armadillidium vulgare  <cit> . interestingly, the observation that several isoforms of a glycine-rich peptide are present in a single organism is in agreement with the identification of infection-induced glycine-rich peptides in c. elegans  <cit>  and of putative glycine-rich attacins in the lepidopteran antherea mylitta  <cit> . similarly, we identified five isoforms  of a linear peptide that are cationic with a glycine content of over 10% and share sequence similarities to the carboxyterminal half of bacterial outer-membrane porins and to a putative antimicrobial peptide from the bug riptortus clavatus  <cit>  .

quantitative real time rt-pcr analysis
in order to precisely determine the immune-induction of genes identified in the present study we used quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis. the eristalis defensin eristalin and the putatively disulfide-bridged anionic peptide et-amp <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively, up-regulated upon lps injection . the determined induction levels are in a similar range as reported for defensins from other insects  <cit> . in contrast, the expression of the housekeeping genes actin and tubulin were not influenced by the treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we analyzed the immune-inducible transcriptome from rat-tailed maggots of the drone fly e. tenax which have evolved the ability to survive in stagnant, frequently anaerobic aquatic habitats with extreme microbial contamination  <cit> . survival in environments with such a strong microbial stress obviously depends on an innate immune system that has been adapted specifically to this ecological niche.

to date, seven distinct antimicrobial peptides have been reported from drosophila, including the antifungal peptides drosomycin and metchnikowin, and five antibacterial peptides: attacin, cecropin, defensin, diptericin and drosocin  <cit> . recently, genome-wide studies with drosophila, anopheles, and aedes reveal that intracellular components of immune signaling pathways are conserved among diptera  <cit> . in accordance, we identified potential counterparts in e. tenax that mediate non-self recognition  or immune-related signaling  in drosophila and anopheles. however, genome-wide studies also elucidate differences between both dipterans, particularly in potential extracellular components of the toll pathway and in effector molecules including antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . in agreement, we identified numerous putative antimicrobial peptides in e. tenax that have obviously no homologues in d. melanogaster,a. gambiae, or a. aegypti. in total, we found  <dig> putative antimicrobial peptides some of which show sequence similarities to antimicrobial defensins, bactenecin- <dig>  or tachycitin.  <dig> peptides are of novel-type including four isoforms of a glycine-rich peptide and five isoforms of a linear peptide. the isoforms may have been evolved by gene duplication and evolutionary selection to target a variety of pathogens, probably in a similar manner to that described for the six α-defensins and four β-defensins from humans  <cit> .

interestingly, we observed a significant e. coli inhibitory activity of hemolymph samples from untreated e. tenax larvae. this was not normally the case with hemolymph samples from other insect species that we analyzed in our laboratory . this significant  expression of antimicrobial peptides might be caused by the uptake of food with a high bacterial load. recently, it has been demonstrated that drosophila gut cells are able to sense bacteria-contaminated food which induces epithelial immune responses  <cit> . thus, there may be an even richer assembly of immunity-related genes in eristalis that would not be detected by our ssh approach.

future work will include chemical or recombinant production of the identified peptides in order to analyze their specific activities against viruses, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa. currently, we are investigating the potential of et-amp <dig> and eristalin to confer resistance against phytopathogens in transgenic plants similar as recently shown for the antifungal peptide gallerimycin from the greater wax moth galleria mellonella  <cit> . in addition, the identified genes may help to elucidate divergent evolution of antimicrobial peptides in diptera and the interdependence between ecological adaptation and insect immune defenses.
