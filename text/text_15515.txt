BACKGROUND
the timing of cell cycle exit is coordinated with cell-fate specification and differentiation in the developing central nervous system  to ensure that the appropriate number of neurons and glia are generated in the correct proportion. if too many neural progenitor cells exit the cell cycle during the early stages of development, then the overall number of cells is reduced, and the ratio of cell types shifts  <cit> .

genetically engineered mice carrying targeted deletions of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell cycle progression have been used to study the coordination of proliferation and cell-fate specification during development. mice lacking the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, rb <dig>  <cit> , were among the first characterized. in embryonic day   <dig>  rb-/- mouse embryos, ectopic mitosis was observed outside the ventricular zone of the developing hindbrain, and concurrent apoptosis was observed in the region where postmitotic cells normally migrate and differentiate  <cit> . in contrast, the e <dig>  rb-/- retina was indistinguishable from e <dig>  wild-type or rb-heterozygous retinas  <cit> .

lee and colleagues proposed that specific neuronal sublineages have unique requirements for rb during development  <cit> . to explain the specific defects in neurogenesis in rb-deficient animals, jacks and colleagues suggested that other, closely related rb proteins such as p <dig> play a more prominent role in certain lineages  <cit> . for example, tissues uniquely dependent on rb  may exhibit defects in rb-/- embryos, but lineages that are not  appear normal in its absence.

although the rb-deficient embryonic mouse retina develops normally up to e <dig> , rb may play an important role at later stages of development  <cit> . using cre-expressing retroviruses and a retinal progenitor-specific cre transgenic mouse line  mated to rblox mice  <cit> , we previously showed that the retinal defects first identified by maandag and colleagues reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for rb at specific developmental stages in retinal progenitor cells and rod photoreceptors  <cit> . two other groups published similar findings using cre transgenic mouse lines with broader expression in the retina  <cit>  and throughout the cns  <cit> . other phenotypes characterized in rb-/- embryos were recently found to be secondary non-cell-autonomous effects caused by changes in extraembryonic tissues  <cit> .

analysis of mice carrying targeted deletions of p <dig> and rb  indicated that p <dig> is important for retinal development  <cit> . mild retinal dysplasia was observed in the rb+/-; p107-/- mice at  <dig> to  <dig> months of age, and histologic analysis of postnatal day   <dig> retinas suggested that dysplasia originated during development  <cit> . subsequent studies using chimeric mice generated from rb-/-; p107-/- embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and those involving conditional inactivation of rb in the developing retina  <cit>  or cns  <cit>  have not elucidated individual roles of rb or p <dig> in retinogenesis.

when progenitor cell proliferation is disrupted during development, secondary effects on cell-fate specification and differentiation are likely to occur  <cit> . therefore, distinguishing the roles of rb and p <dig> in proliferation from those in cell-fate specification is a major challenge. in addition, elucidating the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous  <cit>  roles of the rb family during development can be challenging  <cit> . moreover, as several investigators have proposed  <cit> , individual rb proteins are likely to have both unique and overlapping roles during development, thereby making it difficult to identify their individual contributions. compensation and redundancy can further complicate analyses and obscure the individual roles of rb proteins during development  <cit> . interestingly, the response to acute inactivation of rb in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  differs from that seen when rb is inactivated in a chronic manner  <cit> . this finding increases the complexity of the genetic analyses of rb family function in vivo.

relatively little is known about the expression or the role of the rb family during human fetal retinal development. therefore, we do not know if rb, p <dig> and p <dig> are playing different roles in the developing human and mouse retinas or if cell cycle regulation through the rb family is evolutionarily conserved.

in this study, we used genetic tools  combined with cell cycle analysis to investigate the individual cell-autonomous roles of rb and p <dig> in the developing retina. we also sought to compare rb family expression and intrinsic genetic compensation during retinal development in mice and humans to explain why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following rb <dig> inactivation, but mice are not.

RESULTS
expression of the rb family during mouse retinal development
previous genetic studies have established that inactivation of rb and p <dig> or rb and p <dig> in the developing mouse retina can lead to retinoblastoma  <cit> . however, it is not known if rb, p <dig> and p <dig> are expressed redundantly in the developing mouse retina or if intrinsic genetic compensation by p <dig>  p <dig> or both prevents retinoblastoma in rb-deficient mice. as a first step toward distinguishing between these two possibilities, we analyzed the expression of rb, p <dig> and p <dig> over seven stages of mouse retinal histogenesis. real-time rt-pcr and immunoblot analyses of e <dig>  to p <dig> mice indicated that p <dig> is the primary rb protein expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells . as the levels of p <dig> mrna and protein decreased at p <dig>  those of rb and p <dig> increased   <cit> . however, a low level of rb was detected in a subset of embryonic retinal progenitor cells and newly postmitotic  cells at the basal and apical surfaces of the developing inner neuroblastic layer    <cit> .

the p <dig> mrna and protein were restricted to proliferating retinal progenitor cells in the outer neuroblastic layer  , and p <dig> mrna and protein were restricted to a subset of postnatal retinal progenitor cells, postmitotic neurons and glia in the inner nuclear layer  and ganglion cell layer  during the final stages of retinal histogenesis   <cit> . these data indicated that the embryonic retinal progenitor cells primarily express p <dig> , which is consistent with a lack of any retinal phenotype in rb-/- embryonic retinas. in the postnatal retina and in differentiated neurons and glia of the inl and gcl, rb and p <dig> were expressed redundantly . rb is the only family member expressed in rod photoreceptors, a finding that is consistent with its unique role in the development of this neuronal cell type  <cit> . together, these data suggest that rb and p <dig> are expressed in a largely nonoverlapping pattern during mouse retinal development, which raises the possibility of compensation by p <dig> when rb is inactivated. moreover, rb and p <dig> expression overlaps, which supports the idea that these proteins play redundant roles in a subset of retinal neurons.

expression of the rb family during the cell cycle in retinal progenitor cells
beyond determining when and where each rb family member is expressed during retinal development, it is important to determine when during the cell cycle rb, p <dig> and p <dig> are expressed. these data may help to elucidate their normal roles during development. for example, if a family member is only expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells, then that protein is unlikely to play a role in neuronal differentiation. it has been well established in a variety of culture systems that rb, p <dig> and p <dig> are expressed during different phases of the cell cycle. to directly determine when during the cell cycle these proteins are expressed throughout retinal development, we scored the colocalization of thymidine  with p <dig> , rb  or p <dig>  at five time points during four stages of development  <cit> . the expression of p27kip <dig> has been characterized previously  <cit> , and a parallel set of samples was analyzed for p27kip <dig> expression to serve as an internal control. the p27kip <dig> protein is upregulated as cells exit the cell cycle throughout retinal development, and the kinetics are different at e <dig> , p <dig> and p <dig>  because the length of the retinal progenitor cell cycle increases during retinogenesis  <cit> . at e <dig> , 62% to 77% of proliferating cells expressed p <dig>  and 4% to 6% expressed rb . the 36% reduction in the proportion of p107+ cells at the 24-h time point in e <dig>  retinas was consistent with the previous finding that 20% to 25% of rat retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle at a similar stage  <cit> .

at p <dig>  76% to 87% of proliferating retinal progenitor cells expressed rb , and the remaining cells expressed p <dig> . unlike p107+ cells, rb+ p <dig> retinal progenitor cells continued to express rb after they exited the cell cycle . in the p <dig> retina, the level of p <dig> peaked in the late g2/early m phase of the cell cycle and persisted into g1/g <dig> . many cells downregulated p <dig> as they exited the cell cycle; this finding was consistent with the birth of rod photoreceptors , which do not express p <dig> . results from the thy pulse-labeling experiment combined with those from the immunostaining, real-time rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and immunoblot studies  suggested that p <dig> is expressed primarily in retinal progenitor cells during embryonic retinal development; rb is expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons and glia in the postnatal retina, and p <dig> is expressed in cells exiting the cell cycle during the late stages of retinal development. these data help us to further refine the possible compensatory and redundant roles of rb, p <dig> and p <dig> during retinal development. specifically, rb and p <dig> may play redundant roles in postnatal retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic differentiated neurons of the inl and gcl. rb and p <dig> are both expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells, albeit at different stages of development. inactivation of either rb or p <dig> in proliferating retinal progenitor cells may lead to compensatory upregulation of the other family member.

reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> in mouse retinal progenitor cells
to directly determine whether rb family members compensate for each other in the developing retina, we isolated rna from p107-/-, p107+/-, p107+/+, rb-/-, rb+/- and rb+/+ retinas at e <dig> , p <dig> and p <dig> for real-time pcr analysis. in e <dig>  retinas lacking p <dig>  rb mrna was upregulated in a compensatory manner . similarly, in postnatal retinas lacking rb, p <dig> mrna was upregulated . the expression of p <dig> did not change significantly in any of the samples .

next, we tested whether the rb and p <dig> proteins were also upregulated in a compensatory manner in proliferating retinal progenitor cells. retinas were pulse-labeled with thy for  <dig> h, dissociated and immunostained for rb and p <dig> . the mean proportion of rb+ cells in the e <dig>  p107-/- retinas  was significantly higher than that in stage-matched wild-type retinas . the mean proportion of p107+ cells in the p <dig> rb-/- retinas  was also significantly higher than that in age-matched wild-type retina . the proportion of p107+ cells was lower than that of rb+ cells, because there are fewer proliferating retinal progenitor cells at p <dig> than at e <dig>   <cit> .

we have shown previously that rb is required cell autonomously for the development of postmitotic rod photoreceptors  <cit> . to test whether p <dig> compensates for rb in regulating the development of these postmitotic neurons, we performed electron microscopic  analysis of chx10-cre;rblox/- retinas. one early morphologic feature of rod photoreceptor differentiation is chromatin condensation . in the absence of rb, p <dig> was upregulated, but the cells fated to differentiate into rod photoreceptors, failed to condense their chromatin  and formed defective synapses in the outer plexiform layer  . these data suggest that the p <dig> compensation in the postnatal rb-deficient mouse retina  helped to prevent deregulated proliferation but did not rescue the rod differentiation phenotype  <cit> .

rb is also expressed in a small subset of embryonic retinal progenitor cells , and subtle defects may occur in rb-/- embryonic retinas if p <dig> does not compensate at this stage of development. we immunostained rb-/-, rb+/- and rb+/+ retinas at e <dig>  with antibodies to several cell cycle proteins  and markers of differentiated cell types . there was no difference among the three genotypes, in either the distribution or proportion of cells expressing any of these proliferation or differentiation markers .

to determine if the compensation by rb in p107-deficient retinas  prevented any defects in retinal progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation or both, we analyzed proliferation , apoptosis , cell-fate specification and neuronal differentiation  in p107-/-, p107+/- and p107+/+ retinas at e <dig> , e <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  there was no significant difference among the genotypes at any stage examined . even in vivo lineage studies using a replication-incompetent retrovirus in p107-/-, p107+/- and p107+/+ retinas revealed no defect in proliferation, survival, cell-fate specification or differentiation . together, these genetic analyses suggest that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> in retinal progenitor cells prevents deregulated proliferation during development. the p <dig> protein cannot compensate for rb in postmitotic differentiating rods, and there was no evidence for p <dig> compensation in either rb- or p107-deficient retinas at any stage of development.

p <dig> compensation does not occur in the human fetal retina after rb <dig> inactivation
rb <dig> inactivation is sufficient for retinoblastoma initiation in humans, which suggests that p <dig> does not compensate or play a redundant role when rb <dig> is lost in human fetal retinas. to begin to address this question, we characterized the expression of the rb family during human fetal retinal development by performing immunostaining, in situ hybridization and real-time rt-pcr analyses . primary human fetal retinas from fetal weeks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed; these stages of human fetal development correspond to the entire period of retinal progenitor cell proliferation  in the mouse  <cit> . rb <dig> is the primary family member expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells throughout human retinal development. little p <dig> expression was detected by immunostaining, real-time rt-pcr or in situ hybridization analyses . an internal positive control for these expression studies was the surrounding sclera and pigmented epithelium that expressed high levels of p <dig> . during the late stages of retinal development, p <dig> was expressed in the retina in a pattern similar to that seen in mouse retinal development .

to test if p <dig> compensation occurs when rb <dig> is inactivated, we performed square-wave electroporation to introduce the rb <dig> sirna and a venus-yfp reporter gene into human fetal week  <dig> retinas . the sirna knocked down rb <dig> protein expression by approximately  <dig> fold . an sirna to gapdh and a scrambled rb <dig> sirna were used as negative controls. retinas were maintained in culture for several days by using a procedure we optimized for mouse and primate fetal retinas . retinal progenitor cells proliferated normally with no appreciable cell death for at least  <dig> days while in this culture system . at several time points after electroporation, we labeled proliferating retinal progenitor cells with thy, dissociated the retinas, plated the cells on glass slides and immunostained them for rb <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> . by scoring the expression of the rb family in venus-yfp+ cells that were also thy+, we found that rb <dig> was downregulated by the sirna  <dig> h after electroporation, but there was no compensation by p <dig> or p <dig> . an identical experiment carried out on fetal week  <dig> retinas gave similar results . as positive controls for rb <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> immunostaining, we electroporated parallel cultures with a plasmid expressing these proteins . the expression data combined with that from the rb <dig> gene inactivation studies in primary human fetal retinas suggested that p <dig> is not normally expressed in the developing human retina, and it cannot compensate for rb <dig> loss in this tissue.

acute inactivation of rb in the developing mouse retina
compensation of p <dig> in mefs depends on whether rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner  <cit> . our studies on rb-knockout retinas including chx10-cre;rblox/- retinas showed that p <dig> was upregulated in a compensatory manner after chronic rb inactivation in the retina. to determine whether this result occurs after acute rb gene inactivation in the developing retina in vivo, we introduced a cre-expressing plasmid  into the eyes of newborn rblox/- mice . real-time rt-pcr analysis of purified retinal cell populations  in which rb was acutely inactivated showed that p <dig> mrna was upregulated , as was seen after chronic rb gene inactivation in the developing retina . there was little change in p <dig> expression .

next, we determined whether acute inactivation of rb altered rod development. real-time rt-pcr analysis of rna samples indicated that the early photoreceptor genes nrl and nr2e <dig> were downregulated, as were several other photoreceptor-specific genes . the cells that did not differentiate into photoreceptors resembled progenitor cells, as indicated by the increased expression of eya <dig> and fgf <dig>   <cit> . to further verify these developmental defects, we immunostained the purified cells that had undergone acute rb inactivation and compared them to the control cells . those data were consistent with real-time pcr data showing that acute inactivation of rb not only leads to a compensatory increase in p <dig> expression, but also disrupts rod development. results of experiments in which p <dig> was acutely inactivated in wild-type e <dig>  retinas by using an sirna to p <dig>  <cit>  were similar to those in the p107-knockout retinas, i.e., rb was upregulated in a compensatory manner .

proliferating cells and nondividing or quiescent mefs exhibit differences in the timing of their compensatory upregulation of p <dig> after rb inactivation  <cit> . to test for differences in compensation in proliferating retinal progenitor cells and transition cells  <cit>  in the developing retina, we acutely inactivated rb at p <dig>  even though the majority  of cells in the p <dig> retina are postmitotic  <cit> , a disproportionate number of proliferating retinal progenitor cells  underwent ectopic rounds of cell division . retinal progenitor cells and transition cells were distinguished by brdu labeling prior to electroporation . this finding suggests that retinal progenitor cells in which rb has been acutely inactivated are susceptible to deregulated proliferation. a similar experiment in which all proliferating retinal progenitor cells in the p <dig> retina were labeled with thy for  <dig> h prior to acute rb inactivation showed the same result . specifically, even though retinal progenitor cells comprise only 7% of the total cell population at p <dig>  they comprised 74% ± 4% of the cells that continued to divide after acute rb inactivation . real-time rt-pcr analysis of the samples demonstrated that p <dig> was upregulated in a compensatory manner and that retinal progenitor cell genes such as sfrp <dig>  erdr <dig> and chx <dig> were also upregulated .

to test if p <dig> compensation after acute rb inactivation prevents deregulated proliferation, we acutely inactivated p <dig> by using a previously characterized sirna  <cit>  in retinal cells in which rb was chronically inactivated. we found that proliferation significantly increased from 18% ±  <dig> % to 34% ±  <dig> %  after acute p <dig> inactivation . moreover, the cells that continued to divide expressed retinal progenitor cell markers chx <dig>  pax <dig> and syntaxin and were brdu+ retinal progenitor cells at the time of p <dig> inactivation . together, these data support the idea that p <dig> compensation is important for preventing deregulated proliferation in retinal progenitor cells whether rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner.

haploinsufficiency of p <dig> in the absence of rb
having shown that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> in the developing retina prevents deregulated proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, we tested whether a single copy of rb was sufficient to compensate for p <dig> deficiency and whether a single copy of p <dig> was sufficient to compensate for rb deficiency. immunostaining of rb+/-; p107-/- retinas between p <dig> and p <dig> confirmed the presence of minor focal retinal dysplasia, as reported previously  <cit> . the laminar structure and synaptogenesis outside the regions of focal dysplasia were not substantially disrupted , as confirmed by em analysis of the opl . in addition, em analysis confirmed that rod photoreceptors  <cit>  and horizontal cells  <cit>  form normally with just one copy of rb and no p <dig> . even in the regions of the most severe dysplasia , cells were in their appropriate cellular layers, and synaptic markers were present in the corresponding plexiform layer sublaminae. em analysis suggests that these focal dysplastic lesions are not formed by preneoplastic retinoblastoma cells. that is, there is no evidence for immature tumor cells localized to the lesions.

in contrast to the rb+/-; p107-/- retinas, the chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107+/- retinas exhibited much more severe developmental defects. immunostaining revealed deregulated proliferation and lamination in an apical-basal mosaic pattern that was consistent with the expression of cre from the chx <dig> promoter of the chx10-cre transgene  <cit> . rod photoreceptors were not completely lost due to the mosaic pattern of gene inactivation by the chx10-cre allele  <cit> . defects in opl synaptogenesis  were confirmed by em analysis of p <dig> chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107+/- retinas . müller glia showed upregulated expression of gfap, which is a marker of reactive gliosis ; however, gfap expression was not detectable in müller glia of the rb+/-; p107-/- retinas.

to quantify the proportion and types of cells that were proliferating in rb+/-; p107-/-, rb-/-; p107+/- and rb-/-; p107-/- retinas during development, we labeled p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> retinas with thy for  <dig> h, dissociated the retinas and immunostained the cells with antibodies that recognized each of the retinal cell types . few  of the cells expressing differentiation markers such as recoverin , cone arrestin  or pkcα  incorporated thy . primarily, cells expressing progenitor cell markers  such as syntaxin, pax <dig> or chx <dig> incorporated thy . a small proportion of müller glia also incorporated thy, a finding that was consistent with reactive gliosis-associated proliferation   <cit> . the overall distribution of cell types was not significantly altered in rb+/-; p107-/- retinas , but as expected, the number of rods was reduced in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107+/- retinas .

tunel assay results revealed no difference in the proportion of apoptotic cells in rb+/-; p107-/- retinas and that of their wild-type littermates. the number of apoptotic cells in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107+/- retinas was slightly higher at p <dig> and p <dig>  which corresponded to the stages of increased proliferation . real-time rt-pcr analysis revealed increased expression of the retinal progenitor cell genes cdk <dig>  and sfrp <dig> . together, these data suggest that one copy of rb in rb+/-; p107-/- retinas is sufficient for much of retinal development , but one copy of p <dig> in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107+/- retinas is haploinsufficient to regulate proliferation. specifically, in retinal progenitor cells, two copies of the p <dig> gene are required to compensate for loss of rb, but only one copy of rb is required to compensate for loss of p <dig> 

deregulated proliferation in rb;p107-deficient retinal progenitor cells
it has been shown previously that retinoblastoma forms in rb;p107-deficient retinas  <cit> . therefore, we propose that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> in retinal progenitor cells prevents retinoblastoma in mice. if this is true, then we predict that retinal progenitor cells will continue to divide throughout development  in rb;p107-deficient retinas. this is precisely what we found . the proliferating cells were detected in a mosaic pattern, which was consistent with rb inactivation by the chx10-cre transgene   <cit> . these immature proliferating cells disrupted synaptogenesis in the opl  and expressed the progenitor cell markers syntaxin, pax <dig> and chx <dig>   <cit> . with the exception of activated müller glia , few of the proliferating cells expressed markers of differentiated retinal cells. it is important to point out that syntaxin, pax <dig> and chx <dig> are expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic differentiated cells. however, the combination of brdu, pax <dig>  chx <dig> and syntaxin immunoreactivity combined with morphologic features of these cells in electron micrographs lends support to their identification as retinal progenitor cells.

in contrast to findings from a recent study  <cit> , we did not detect any defect in cone photoreceptor production in retinal sections  or in dissociated cells scored at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or p <dig> . em analysis of chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107-/- retinas revealed immature cells spanning all cellular layers of the retina . these electron micrographs support the hypothesis that chx10+, pax6+, brdu+ cells in the onl and inl are retinal progenitor cells rather than differentiated cells. in addition, real-time pcr analysis demonstrated an increase in the expression of retinal progenitor cell markers in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107-/- retinas at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> .

our analysis of the rb;p107-deficient retinas over the course of postnatal retinal development showed that at all stages of development studied, there are ectopically dividing cells with morphologic features of retinal progenitor cells that express markers of retinal progenitor cells. our data support the hypothesis that the role of reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> is to prevent deregulated proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. if this is true, then we would expect that inactivation of rb and p <dig> in a single proliferating retinal progenitor cell would lead to clonal expansion.

we infected proliferating retinal progenitor cells in newborn rblox/-; p107-/- mice with the cre-expressing retrovirus lia-cre . we observed significantly larger clone sizes and changes in cell-fate specification . to quantify the deregulated proliferation, we used the nin-cre retrovirus, which expresses nuclear lacz and cre, in e <dig>  rblox/lox; p107-/- retinas; nin virus was used as a control. clone size increased and was consistent with deregulated retinal progenitor cell proliferation. in control retinas infected with nin,  <dig> of  <dig>  clones were one cell, and  <dig> of  <dig>  contained more than two cells. in retinas infected with nin-cre,  <dig> of  <dig>  clones were one cell, and  <dig> of  <dig>  contained more than two cells . similar results were seen in studies using the e1a 13s oncogene  <cit> .

proliferation of progenitor cells and postmitotic transition cells in rb;p107-deficient retinas
the developmental studies and clonal analyses described above suggest that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> prevents deregulated retinal progenitor cell proliferation and retinoblastoma. however, we have shown that p <dig> compensation also occurs at p <dig> when the majority  of cells are postmitotic . therefore, it is possible that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> prevents newly postmitotic cells from re-entering the cell cycle rather than preventing deregulated proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. to test this possibility directly, we labeled all proliferating retinal progenitor cells in p <dig> rblox/lox; p107-/- retinas with thy , inactivated rb expression by electroporating a plasmid that expressed cre and vyfp and then incubated the retinas with brdu. cells that were brdu+, vyfp+ and thy+ were retinal progenitor cells at the beginning of the experiment that continued to divide after acute rb inactivation. in contrast, cells that were brdu+, vyfp+ and thy- were postmitotic transition cells at the beginning of the experiment that re-entered the cell cycle after acute rb inactivation. the time point p <dig> was selected because the vast majority  of cells in the retina at that stage are postmitotic  <cit> . if a postmitotic cell re-enters the cell cycle after acute rb inactivation in rblox/lox; p107-/- retinas, then the majority of brdu+ cells would be thy-. if a retinal progenitor cell is more susceptible to deregulated proliferation after acute rb inactivation, then we would predict that the majority of brdu+ cells would be thy+. if both retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic cells divide after acute rb inactivation, then the proportions of brdu+, thy- cells and brdu+, thy+ cells will reflect the proportions of postmitotic cells and mitotic cells in the starting population, respectively.

most  ectopically dividing cells were brdu+, thy+ cells . consistent with this finding, results from real-time pcr and immunostaining analyses revealed that ectopically dividing cells expressed several retinal progenitor cell markers including pax <dig>  chx <dig>  syntaxin, erdr <dig> and sfrp <dig> . however, there was a small increase in the proportion of brdu+, thy- cells , which leaves open the possibility that either a retinal progenitor cell or a transition cell is the cell of origin for retinoblastoma .

discussion
we report here that in the developing mouse retina p <dig> is expressed in embryonic retinal progenitor cells, and rb is expressed in postnatal retinal progenitor cells. when p <dig> is inactivated, rb is upregulated in a compensatory manner, and when rb is inactivated, p <dig> compensates. the p <dig> protein is expressed during the late stages of retinogenesis and persists in the inl and gcl in the adult retina. rb and p <dig> are expressed redundantly in these cells. there was no evidence of compensatory changes in p <dig> expression following either rb or p <dig> inactivation. compensation by p <dig> occurred when rb was inactivated acutely or chronically in the developing mouse retina. two copies of the p <dig> gene were required to prevent deregulated proliferation of rb-deficient retinal progenitor cells, making p <dig> haploinsufficient for compensation in the developing retina. in contrast, only one copy of rb was required to regulate proliferation of p107-deficient retinal progenitor cells. we propose that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> prevents deregulated proliferation of retinal progenitor cells and retinoblastoma in mice. similarly, redundant expression of rb and p <dig> may help to prevent retinoblastoma in mice.

in contrast to mice, human fetal retinal progenitor cells primarily express rb <dig> during development. when rb <dig> was acutely inactivated in human fetal retinas, there was little if any compensatory upregulation of p <dig>  this may explain why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following rb <dig> gene mutations, but mice require inactivation of rb and p <dig> or rb and p <dig> 

overlapping and unique functions of the rb family in the developing mouse retina
immunostaining, in situ hybridization, real-time rt-pcr and immunoblot analyses revealed that p <dig> is expressed primarily in proliferating retinal progenitor cells of the embryonic mouse retina. pulse-labeling with thy demonstrated that p <dig> is downregulated as cells exit the cell cycle. there were no defects in cell-fate specification or differentiation in p107-deficient retinas; thus, we propose that p <dig> primarily regulates retinal progenitor cell proliferation in the embryonic retina. rb is expressed in postnatal retinal progenitor cells and differentiating neurons and glia. consistent with a role in cell-fate specification or differentiation, rb was expressed throughout the cell cycle and continued to be expressed as cells entered g <dig>  in the absence of rb, immature cells persist in the onl and rod photoreceptors failed to form, a finding that indicates that rb regulates the developmental processes in this specific sublineage.

recent studies have extended these findings by focusing on the mechanism of rb's role in rod development. sun and colleagues generated an exon-specific knock-in allele of rb with a single amino acid substitution  that reduces rb binding to e2f <dig>  e2f <dig> and e2f <dig>  <cit> . in chx10-cre;rb654/lox retinas, rods still fail to form. this finding led to a model in which rb regulates a rod repressor gene through e2f <dig>  e2f <dig> or e2f <dig>  and in the absence of rb, the rod lineage is blocked. moreover, we predict that inactivation of the e2f that regulates this putative "rod repressor" would rescue the rod developmental defect. preliminary data have shown that rb;e2f1-deficient retinas have normal rod development, a finding that suggests that e2f <dig> is involved in this important developmental process.

our data suggest that rb and p <dig> share the same role in regulating mouse retinal progenitor cell proliferation but the role of rb is unique in rods. an extensive genetic analysis of p <dig> is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but based on our expression studies and thy-labeling experiments, we predict that rb and p <dig> are redundant in newly postmitotic cells of the inl and gcl. it is not known if p <dig> is required for terminal cell cycle exit in the developing retina, for maintaining cells in the postmitotic state or both.

a recent study published by spencer and colleagues characterized the expression of the rb family in developing mouse retina and adult human retina  <cit> . our data differ from theirs, and we have presented the most relevant differences in figure  <dig>  our analysis combined several independent methods ; these approaches provided the same overall picture of the dynamic changes in the expression of the rb family during seven stages of mouse retinal development. spencer and colleagues provided a more limited data set with internal inconsistencies. for example, immunostaining was done on samples from just three stages of mouse retinal development , and in situ hybridization was carried out for rb but not for p <dig> or p <dig>  their real-time rt-pcr and immunoblotting data show high levels of p <dig> expression in the embryonic retinas, but no p107+ nuclei are detected in their immunostained sections. clearly, all expression data are limited by the reagents being used. for example, it is possible that the rb, p <dig> and p <dig> expression patterns in our study or that of spencer and colleagues are broader than reported due to the limited sensitivity of the antibodies used. we have attempted to minimize such limitations by combining several independent approaches such as in situ hybridization, immunostaining, real time rt-pcr and dissociated cell staining. nontheless, we anticipate that the retinal expression pattern of the rb family will be further refined as new reagents become available.

rb family redundancy and compensation in the developing mouse retina
the rb family proteins are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. we show here that p <dig> is expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells in the embryonic retina and is downregulated as cells exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. around birth, the expression of p <dig> tapers off, and that of rb takes it place in proliferating retinal progenitor cells. rb expression persists in postmitotic differentiating neurons and glia of the mouse retina. the p <dig> protein is expressed in the late postnatal period of mouse retinal development. as cells exit the cell cycle, they upregulate p <dig>  and its expression persists in postmitotic differentiating cells of the inl and gcl. based on the expression pattern alone, one might predict that proliferation would be deregulated in p107-deficient embryonic retinas and rb-deficient postnatal retinas. however, we report here that when p <dig> is inactivated, rb is upregulated in a compensatory manner in the embryonic retina. similarly, when rb is inactivated, p <dig> is upregulated in a compensatory manner in the postnatal retina. there is no evidence for compensation by p <dig> in either rb- or p107-deficient retinas.

one of the interesting features of the compensation that we uncovered in this study is the haploinsufficiency of p <dig> in this process. we show here that two copies of p <dig> are required for efficient compensation of rb loss, but only one copy of rb is required to compensate for p <dig> loss. this may indicate that there are different mechanisms for rb and p <dig> gene compensation or that retinal progenitor cells exhibit different sensitivities to rb and p <dig> protein levels. one intriguing possibility is that p <dig> haploinsufficiency for compensation may reflect the differential binding of rb and p <dig> to different e2f family members.

it has been shown previously that p <dig> is an e2f-responsive gene; therefore, the mechanisms for p <dig> compensation most likely involve a direct feedback loop  <cit> . however, the mechanism for rb compensation in the absence of p <dig> has not been elucidated. we propose that rb-deficient retinal progenitor cells fail to form retinoblastoma because p <dig> is upregulated in a compensatory manner. however, it is possible that there is some overlapping, redundant expression around p <dig> in the developing mouse retina. interestingly, rb and p <dig> are expressed redundantly in the inl and gcl. the recent observation that retinoblastoma develops in rb;p130-deficient retinas suggests that redundant expression of these two rb family members prevents retinoblastoma in mice  <cit> .

previous studies using rb-/- mefs demonstrated that inactivation of rb in proliferating cells leads to compensatory upregulation of p <dig> and quiescence after serum starvation <cit> . the p <dig> gene is persistently expressed in these quiescent rb-deficient mefs and is required for maintaining them in g <dig>  when rb was acutely inactivated in quiescent rblox/lox mefs, p <dig> was not immediately upregulated in a compensatory manner, and the cells re-entered the cell cycle  <cit> . therefore, chronic or acute inactivation of rb can lead to very different outcomes in mefs. the molecular changes that occur in mefs as they become quiescent have been compared with those that accompany terminal cell cycle exit during development  <cit> . however, in the developing cns, postmitotic neurons not only exit the cell cycle, but also migrate to their appropriate layer, extend axons and dendrites and form synaptic connections.

to test if there was any difference in p <dig> compensation following acute versus chronic rb inactivation in the developing retina, we developed genetic tools  <cit>  to acutely inactivate rb in this context. our data show that p <dig> compensation occurs when rb is inactivated acutely or chronically in the developing retina. in addition, rod photoreceptors failed to form when rb was acutely inactivated. these data suggest that p <dig> compensates for rb in proliferating retinal progenitor cells, but it cannot take the place of rb in differentiating rod photoreceptors.

we extended our acute inactivation studies to knock out rb in p107-deficient cells and to knock out p <dig> in rb-deficient cells. in these experiments, we compared the effects of acute gene inactivation on proliferating retinal progenitor cells and newly postmitotic transition cells. the newly postmitotic rb-deficient transition cells in which p <dig> was acutely inactivated did not show extensive ectopic cell division. these data are consistent with the idea that p <dig> is important in regulating retinal progenitor cell proliferation but not in preventing newly postmitotic cells from re-entering the cell cycle. however, a small subset of postmitotic cells still re-entered the cell cycle following acute rb inactivation in p107-deficient retinas. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the retinoblastoma cell of origin is a retinal transition cell  <cit> . definitive proof will rely on following the expansion of clones lacking p <dig> and rb to determine whether any rare transition cells re-enter the cell cycle and expand to generate retinoblastoma or if only retinal progenitor cells continue to proliferate, as shown here  <cit> .

our data on the proliferation of rb;p107-deficient retinal cells during development contrasts with previous studies by chen and colleagues  <cit> . we show that ectopically dividing retinal cells are present at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  whereas the previous study argued that proliferation ceased at p <dig>  this difference at p <dig> may be due to the more sensitive and reproducible thy labeling we used in our study compared to the brdu labeling used by chen et al. alternatively, it could reflect the non-cell-autonomous effect of broad rb inactivation in pax6-cre;rblox/lox; p107-/- retinas examined by chen et al. compared with the more restricted mosaic rb inactivation in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107-/- retinas that we investigated  <cit> .

another difference between our data and the study previously published by chen and colleagues involves the interpretation of the markers expressed in proliferating cells of the rb;p107-deficient retinas. we found that at p <dig>  the ectopically dividing cells were largely pax6+ . by p <dig>  the proliferating cells were pax6+, chx10+  and by p <dig>  they were pax6+, chx10+ and syntaxin+ . pax <dig>  <cit>  and syntaxin  <cit>  are expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and differentiating amacrine cells. chx <dig> is expressed in retinal progenitor cells and in differentiated bipolar cells and müller glia  <cit> . interestingly, at p <dig> we noted that gfap+ müller glia were also thy+. this finding is consistent with proliferation associated with reactive gliosis in rb;p107-deficient retinas  <cit> . chx <dig> immunopositivity may mark the proliferating müller glia, bipolar cells or progenitor cells at this stage. however, we do not believe that the chx10+ cells are bipolar cells, because there were no pkcα+ cells that incorporated thy at p <dig>  at p <dig>  most of the proliferating thy+ cells were syntaxin+. a smaller proportion were pax6+, recoverin+ and pkcα+. recoverin is expressed in a subset of bipolar cells as well as photoreceptors, so the pkcα+ and recoverin+ cells that incorporated thy are most likely a small cohort of bipolar cells that re-entered the cell cycle.

based on the timeline of marker colocalization with thy that we present here, we propose that a pax6+, chx10+ and syntaxin+ retinal progenitor cell population that is biased toward the amacrine/horizontal cell fate continues to proliferate through development in chx10-cre;rblox/-; p107-/- retinas and eventually gives rise to retinoblastoma. this model is consistent with the extensive differentiation of mouse retinoblastomas along amacrine/horizontal cell lineage . there is an occasional round of ectopic proliferation in reactive müller glia and possibly bipolar cells at p <dig>  but based on the absence of glial and bipolar markers in mouse retinoblastomas, we propose that these cells do not contribute significantly to retinoblastoma in mice.

chen and colleagues  <cit>  showed that pax6+, chx10+, prox1+, math3+, crx+ and hes5+ cells incorporated brdu. with the possible exception of crx, each of these markers is expressed in both progenitor cells and differentiated cells  <cit> . we have found that several additional retinal progenitor cell markers  are expressed in proliferating cells of rb;p107-deficient retinas. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that are expressed in proliferating rb;p107-deficient retinal cells have one feature in common; they are all expressed normally in retinal progenitor cells. the morphological features of the rb;p107-deficient retinal cells in electron micrographs are also consistent with retinal progenitor cells. while these data support the hypothesis that retinal progenitor cells continue to divide during development of rb;p107-deficient retinas and eventually give rise to retinoblastoma in mice, marker expression alone cannot distinguish between a progenitor cell and a transition cell as the cell of origin for retinoblastoma . definitive proof of the cell of origin for retinoblastoma will require clonal analysis of tumor formation from a single cell in vivo.

retinoblastoma susceptibility in mice and humans
when the rb-knockout mouse was generated over  <dig> years ago, it was expected that retinoblastoma would develop in rb+/- mice, as it does in rb1+/- humans. however, that was not the case. we show here that the normal expression of rb family members is dynamic during mouse retinal development and that reciprocal compensation between rb and p <dig> may prevent retinoblastoma in mice.

in the human fetal retina, rb <dig> is the major family member expressed during much of retinal development. there is little or no expression of p <dig>  we acutely inactivated rb <dig> in primary human fetal retinas by electroporating an sirna to rb <dig>  we demonstrated that although the rb <dig> protein was downregulated 20-fold, there was no compensation by p <dig> or p <dig>  these data suggest that humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma formation after rb <dig> inactivation, because they cannot upregulate p <dig> in a compensatory manner. it is possible that the 20-fold reduction in rb <dig> protein induced by the sirna used for these experiments is not sufficient to induce p <dig> compensation. however, we do not believe this is the case because another rb <dig> target gene  is induced by 10-fold following acute rb <dig> inactivation using the same sirna . one possible explanation for the lack of compensation in the human retina is that the p <dig> promoter is sequestered in an inactive chromatin conformation in human fetal retina, but it is in an active chromatin conformation in mouse retinal progenitor cells and is thus poised to respond to a loss of rb. indeed, it is believed that promoters and genes that have been recently transcribed remain in an active chromatin configuration. therefore, this model is consistent with the expression data for mouse and human p <dig>  that is, the embryonic expression of p <dig> in the mouse retina results in an open chromatin conformation, thereby making it readily accessible for compensatory upregulation if rb is inactivated. detailed promoter and transcription analyses will be required to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that rb and p <dig> are expressed in a largely non-overlapping pattern during mouse retinal development and that reciprocal compensation between these two rb family members prevents retinoblastoma in mice. p <dig> compensation occurs whether rb is inactivated chronically or acutely. in human retinal development, there is very little p <dig> expressed and compensation does not occur when rb <dig> is inactivated using an sirna. we propose that this difference in compensation between mice and humans may explain why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following rb <dig> gene inactivation but mice require simultaneous inactivation of the rb and p <dig> genes.

our data also shed light on the retinoblastoma cell of origin. proliferating retinal progenitor cells are disproportionately more susceptible to deregulated proliferation following rb;p <dig> gene inactivation in comparison to newly postmitotic transition cells  <cit> . consistent with this observation,  <dig> of  <dig> genes expressed in proliferating rb;p107-deficient retinal cells are normally expressed in retinal progenitor cells. electron micrographs of rb;p107-deficient retinal cells provides further support for an immature cell with features of progenitor cells as the retinoblastoma cell of origin. however, based on our data, it remains a formal possibility that a postmitotic amacrine or horizontal cell is the retinoblastoma cell of origin. ongoing lineage studies should help to determine if a progenitor cell, a postmitotic neuron or both can give rise to retinoblastoma in mice.
