BACKGROUND

campylobacter jejuni is the predominant bacterial species causing human enteric disease globally . in the united states the reported number of human clinical cases is second only to salmonella, and the incidence of disease attributed to c. jejuni is increasing in many countries  <cit> . this organism can be recovered from many animals, including cattle, pigs, chickens, wild birds, flies, and protozoa, from retail foods, especially chicken, and from the environment  <cit> . despite the observation that many animals may serve as hosts for c. jejuni, poultry is thought to be the predominant source of human infections  <cit> .

surveillance for c. jejuni has been accomplished via dna fingerprinting or molecular typing methods of variable discriminatory power, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , multilocus sequence typing , ribosomal mlst , flagellin short variable region  sequencing, and pora gene  sequencing  <cit> . using these methods, c. jejuni outbreak detection occurs relatively infrequently compared to detection of outbreaks caused by other enteric bacteria  <cit> . water, milk, and chicken products are the most frequently reported sources of c. jejuni outbreaks  <cit> , with the majority of human cases assumed to be sporadic. much of what we know about the passage of bacterial pathogens through the food chain and their interaction with human populations comes from characterization of foodborne-outbreak events  <cit> . the use of newer technologies and higher resolution methods like next-generation whole genome sequencing  provides more robust outbreak detection and characterization. in addition, comparative genomic methods can be used to investigate the biological and pathogenic mechanisms contributing to bacterial interactions with their environment, including their propagation and survival strategies as bacteria navigate the food chain to cause human clinical illness.

wgs is rapidly becoming a primary analytic method for bacterial phylogenetic studies, detection of bacterial pathogens in clinical laboratories, and outbreak detection and analysis . however, in specific instances it may be more economically efficient to perform wgs on a smaller number of isolates representative of a larger population, such as when initiating studies aimed at the development of high-throughput, low-cost molecular subtyping assays for rapid or large-scale screening  <cit> . phylogenetic studies based on high-quality single nucleotide variant  distances and overall gene content have to date supported the current understanding that c. jejuni comprises a highly diverse group of organisms  <cit> . furthermore, wgs has been used to characterize isolates associated with milk- and water-borne c. jejuni outbreaks in finland  <cit>  and to retrospectively identify case clusters from groups of isolates that were initially presumed to be associated with sporadic infections  <cit> . genomic methods such as ribosomal mlst , core genome mlst , and whole genome mlst  are complementary methods to extant, pre-genomic era typing schemes. each of these newer genomic methods provides incrementally greater resolution, discriminatory power, and insight into c. jejuni populations while retaining the capability of accurately detecting case clusters  <cit> . however, the utility of wgs is not limited to phylogenetic analysis, and can provide clues about the virulence of an organism, its niche adaptation, its chromosomal structure, and other aspects of its biology . we were therefore interested in undertaking a comprehensive analysis of isolates associated with the largest recorded canadian campylobacter outbreak, reasoning that valuable insights into the campylobacter genome could be obtained through a robust analysis of whole genome sequences.

four closely related c. jejuni isolates from a significant canadian waterborne outbreak in  <dig>  <cit>  were subjected to wgs. these isolates were epidemiologically linked to the outbreak, previously typed as walkerton outbreak strain  <dig>  <cit> , and had common hs  and hl  serotypes, biotype, mlst sequence type, and fla-svr type. the pfge restriction patterns varied according to the presence and location of the cjie <dig> prophage within the bacterial chromosome  <cit> . our previous investigations into the role of cjie <dig> indicated that carriage of this prophage is linked to differences in bacterial phenotype  <cit>  and protein expression  <cit> . three isolates carrying the cjie <dig> prophage exhibited increased adherence and invasion in cell culture compared with an isolate lacking the prophage  <cit> . furthermore, there were differences in protein expression levels in the three isolates carrying the prophage compared with the isolate lacking the prophage  <cit> . these results suggested the cjie <dig> prophage may affect diverse aspects of the biology of the organism. previous, unpublished dna-microarray data suggested that the isolates were genetically very similar except for the carriage of the cjie <dig> prophage. however, it remained unknown if there were additional genetic differences other than those revealed using the earlier typing methods and dna microarray technology.

our first goal was to investigate the total genetic content among the isolates to determine if the isolates were 1) clonal, 2) differed mainly by the presence or absence of the cjie <dig> prophage, and 3) harboured genetic differences with potential biological relevance other than the cjie <dig> prophage. a second goal was to determine whether a thorough comparative genome analysis would provide additional insight into the population structure, genome plasticity, and virulence potential of the outbreak isolates. we determined that the genomic location and number of homopolymeric tracts within the four isolates and several other strains with complete, finished wgs suggested that the location and number of homopolymeric tracts may be useful to inform strain identity, relatedness, or clonal descent when assessing bacterial isolates that appear to be clonally or epidemiologically related. comparative analysis also revealed the presence of a large, genetically syntenous chromosomal inversion, indicating structural heterogeneity of the chromosome and suggesting that the inversion may either have a biologically relevant phenotype or could be used as a marker specific for the outbreak isolates. together, these results demonstrate the ability of wgs-based analysis to provide a great deal of in-depth, disparate, yet highly-valuable information about the organism under study.

RESULTS
the major genomic difference among outbreak isolates is the presence of cjie <dig> prophage
draft genomes of the four c. jejuni outbreak-associated isolates were obtained by paired-end sequencing on an illumina miseq platform. complete, closed, and finished genomes were obtained using a combination of read mapping to a reference genome, nctc11168 = atcc  <dig>  and bridging of contig gaps by sanger sequencing . the genome sizes of isolates 00– <dig> , 00– <dig> , and 00– <dig>  are very similar, differing by a maximum of  <dig> bases. in contrast, the genome size of isolate 00– <dig> was  <dig> , <dig> bases, a difference of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bases from the previous three genomes. this difference is very close to the estimated size of prophage cjie <dig> in c. jejuni isolate 00– <dig> of approximately  <dig>  bases. both isolates 00– <dig> and 00– <dig> were annotated as having  <dig> cdss, compared with  <dig> cdss for isolate 00– <dig> and  <dig> cdss for isolate 00– <dig>  dna sequence alignments revealed that the four isolates were genetically syntenic with nearly identical gene content in all four strains apart from the cjie <dig> prophage , the presence of four trna loci  near the aas gene only in isolate 00– <dig> , and the different chromosomal insertion site of cjie <dig> in isolate 00– <dig> . this latter observation validated an earlier observation demonstrating chromosomal heterogeneity of the cjie <dig> prophage in an otherwise clonal population of isolates  <cit> .fig.  <dig> alignment of the four c. jejuni outbreak isolates and reference strain nctc11168 = atcc  <dig>  the locations of the  <dig> kb invertible region and the cjie <dig> prophage are shown. approximate locations of cjie <dig> prophages, capsule biosynthesis, flagellar glycosylation, and los biosynthesis regions are also shown. note that the los biosynthesis region as shown also contains the general glycosylation region. the figure was prepared using progressive mauve

whole genome sequencing also revealed a  <dig>  bp plasmid harboured by one isolate, c. jejuni 00– <dig>  showing high homology to ptet plasmids in the ncbi repository but varying due to the insertion of a transposable element comprised of the is <dig> transposase  and integrase-resolvase  genes adjacent to a gene encoding aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase a short distance away from the plasmid-encoded tet.

phylogenetic analysis indicates that the four outbreak isolates are clonally related
high quality snvs  were identified and interrogated as outlined in the methods section. whole genome sequence alignments of the outbreak isolates to the reference strain, nctc11168 = atcc  <dig>  were performed. nctc11168 = atcc  <dig> was selected as the reference for hqsnv analysis based on a neighbor-joining analysis using  <dig> publicly-available complete c. jejuni genomes that revealed this strain was a very close genetic neighbour to the outbreak isolates . the core phylogenetic analysis revealed that, overall, the outbreak isolates differed by a total of  <dig> snvs from one another, and in both the core genome and whole genome phylogenetic trees the outbreak isolates formed a distinct group within the overall topology of c. jejuni isolates . snv analysis indicated they were most closely related to other mlst clonal complex  st- <dig> strains, especially yh <dig>  which is sequence type   <dig>  and the two nctc <dig> strains, which are st <dig> table  <dig> high quality core snvs in outbreak isolates using nctc11168 = atccc  <dig> as the reference


fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of c. jejuni sequenced in this study compared with publicly available c. jejuni. the tree was constructed using hqsnv analysis as outlined in the methods section




a hqsnv at position  <dig> , <dig> in isolate 00– <dig>  results in the locus encoding the threonine/serine transporter sstt becoming a pseudogene. as discussed earlier  <cit>  the nctc <dig> annotation and available data indicates that this protein is a serine transporter without any additional function and, as such, would not be expected to impart global regulatory effects. of the  <dig> hqsnvs detected ,  <dig> were present only in isolate 00– <dig> and two were found only in isolate 00– <dig>  in addition to the snvs identified using the hqsnv core genome analysis, whole genome sequence using nucmer  revealed several additional snvs . many of these were unique to isolate 00– <dig>  and were located in two genes encoding motility functions; flagellin a and the motility accessory factor protein homologous to cj1341c. we hypothesize that these are allelic differences arising from homologous recombination. these data provide further evidence that isolate 00– <dig> is not as closely related as the other three outbreak isolates. the analysis also revealed a snv at position  <dig>  in isolate 00– <dig>  that would result in the phosphate acetyltransferase protein product being a pseudogene in isolate 00– <dig>  however, this position was located within a homopolymeric tract of t residues. homopolymeric tracts are intrinsically repetitive and are therefore omitted from snv analysis. the full-length phosphate acetyltransferase protein may be expressed due to rapid changes caused by homopolymeric tract length variability.

we further subjected the four isolates to cgmlst analysis using a schema based on  <dig> core genes . because the four outbreak isolates belong to st <dig>  we included additional genomes belonging to this sequence type obtained from the bacterial isolate genome sequence database   <cit>  or sequenced by our group  to provide greater context to the hqsnv results. the cgmlst results  supported our phylogenetic findings and confirmed that the outbreak isolates were genetically highly similar. core genome analysis revealed that st <dig> represents a heterogeneous population of isolates comprised of distinct clusters with limited intra-cluster variability and high levels of inter-cluster variability . whereas the average number of variant loci between pairs of genomes was  <dig> , the four outbreak isolates clustered with four additional canadian isolates with an average of  <dig>  variant loci. within this cluster, isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig> and 00– <dig> showed the least amount of genetic variation, differing at an average of  <dig>  loci. with an average of  <dig>  variant loci, isolate 00– <dig> showed slightly higher divergence with respect to the three other outbreak isolates. four additional c. jejuni isolates were in the same immediate cluster as the walkerton outbreak isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig> . three were isolated in  <dig> from ontario, while the fourth was isolated in  <dig> from alberta, indicating that this clade was both stable in time and geographically widespread. this group of eight strains was part of a larger cluster, clade  <dig>  which in turn comprised only a very small branch on a dendrogram of a st <dig> phylogeny with a total of  <dig> clades . in this context the four walkerton isolates are very closely related to each other and likely to be clonally derived, consistent with epidemiological data from the outbreak.fig.  <dig> cgmlst tree showing phylogenetic relationships of the four outbreak isolates compared with other st <dig> isolates. the tree was created using isolates within one of  <dig> clades  arising from a larger analysis of st <dig> strains . clade  <dig> contains c. jejuni strains most closely related to the four isolates  sequenced for this work




homopolymeric tracts are useful for assessing relationships among isolates
because the number and location of homopolymeric tracts is known to vary among different c. jejuni isolates  <cit> , we identified the locations of polyg/polyc tracts more than seven bases long in the four isolates sequenced for this study by searching dna sequences in genbank files for strings of gs or cs of eight nucleotides or longer and associating the position with the location of genes .table  <dig> consensus homopolymeric tracts in genomes of the four sequenced c jejuni isolates

all four outbreak isolates carried  <dig> homopolymeric tracts in the same genomic locations, though the number of nucleotides within some of these exhibited apparent strain-specific variation. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , both the number and locations of homopolymeric tracts were different in the eight other strains included for comparisons , further supporting the premise that the four walkerton c. jejuni are closely related clonal variants more similar to one another than to other c. jejuni strains. however, these four isolates carried  <dig> of the  <dig> homopolymeric tracts present in nctc <dig>  missing homopolymeric tracts only in the type iis restriction/modification enzyme  and the sodium:sulfate symporter . in contrast, only 17/ <dig> c. jejuni yh <dig> homopolymeric tracts were in the same location in c. jejuni yh <dig> and the four outbreak isolates. yh <dig> is an isolate from beef liver  <cit>  that appeared to have substantial differences from the outbreak isolates and nctc <dig>  in the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis region, which was most similar to regions encoding hs: <dig> . methods that do not take into account hypervariable regions may overestimate isolate relatedness. this was confirmed in the neighbor-joining analysis of c. jejuni complete genomes discussed in the previous section .

eight of the homopolymeric tracts present in the four walkerton isolates were also present in a majority of the eight whole genome-sequenced strains analyzed . their locations were within homologs of proteins annotated in nctc <dig> as cj0045c , cj <dig> , cj0685c , cj <dig> , cj <dig> , cj <dig> , between cj <dig> and cj <dig>  or between cj <dig> and the 16s rrna locus.

identification and characterization of a previously unidentified large chromosomal inversion in outbreak isolates
the process of genome closing and finishing enabled the identification of a large, genetically syntenous region present in the outbreak isolates that was in reverse orientation compared to the reference genome. this was revealed during gap closure using pcr primers consistent with the reported genome sequences of c. jejuni strains nctc <dig> and rm  <dig>  shown in table  <dig>  these primers were designed to bind outside repeat regions at the ends of the contigs that affected the assembly of the genome.table  <dig> primers used to detect the 93- and 388-kb inversions and the ptet plasmid

while use of the cj-f <dig> and cj-r <dig> or cj-f <dig> and cj-r <dig> primers pairs did not result in gap closure, pcr using the cj-f1/cj-f <dig> and cj-r1/cjr <dig> primer combinations  successfully amplified a ~ <dig>  kb product spanning the gaps between contigs. this indicates that within the genomes of the four isolates an approximately 93-kb section of the genome between genes homologous to cj <dig>  and cj <dig>  was inverted relative to nctc <dig>  and several other annotated c. jejuni genomes within the ncbi database . the nctc <dig> strain  used in our laboratory as a reference strain for pcr determination of inversion sequence termini was found to harbour an ~92-kb chromosomal inversion that was extremely similar to the four sequenced outbreak isolates. this experimental finding was in contrast to the sequence annotation for nctc11168 = atcc  <dig> in ncbi, which does not contain an annotated inversion. it is unclear if this was because our reference strain is a variant of nctc <dig> arising from repeated laboratory passage or if this is the result of an error with the annotated sequence in the ncbi repository. analogs of the 93-kb inversion were not limited to hs: <dig> or st <dig> isolates, though to date the inversions we have found all belong to cc st- <dig> strains. an inversion with the same core gene content was detected in isolates 00– <dig>  and yh <dig> .fig.  <dig> schematic diagram of the 00– <dig> genome with repeats and potential inversions. the image was obtained with the 00– <dig> genbank file using gview server  <cit>  and shows the locations of the repeat sequences associated with chemotaxis genes in the 00– <dig> genome and genomic regions that may be inverted by recombination between these repeats. the approximate locations of the sequence repeats  and the approximate size of the fragments that might be inverted are shown. the inside multicolored circle shows clusters of orthologous groups, while the red circle represents the 00– <dig> genome




the c. jejuni nctc <dig> original annotation  documents the existence of three large sequence repeats located in the loci cj <dig>  cj0262c, and cj <dig>  all of which were annotated as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, later renamed transducer-like proteins   <cit> . different tlps have divergent n-termini, with the repeats located in dna sequences encoding the c-termini. the repeats associated with cj <dig> and cj <dig> flank a region in nctc <dig> of  <dig>  nt that shares 99% nt identity with the  <dig> -kb inverted region in the four outbreak isolates . genome analysis revealed that each of the four isolates sequenced for this study  also harbour large sequence repeats within genes analogous to those in nctc <dig>  these repeats were in proteins annotated as a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein , a ribose and galactose chemoreceptor protein , and a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein ; the first tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> flank the 93-kb invertible element in the outbreak isolates. the gene content within the invertible region may be maintained even though there may be changes in the adjacent methyl-accepting chemotaxis loci/tlps. this warrants further investigation.

the repeat sequences associated with each of the three tlp loci displayed 100% sequence identity in all four outbreak isolates, although the different tlp genes harbour repeats of different lengths . in the outbreak isolates the first repeat  was  <dig> nt, the second  <dig> nt, and the third  <dig> nt . we have designated the  <dig> nt repeat unit “repeat 1”, the  <dig> nt repeat unit “repeat 2” and third  <dig> repeat unit “repeat 3”. repeat  <dig> is in reverse orientation to the other two in the outbreak isolates, and all three repeats display high levels of nucleotide identity over variable sequence lengths: 1969/ <dig>  between repeats  <dig> and 3; 1004/ <dig>  between repeats  <dig> and 2; 994/ <dig>  between repeats  <dig> and  <dig> . the two tlp <dig> genes exhibit identity over 1955/ <dig> nt using ncbi blastn, and the respective proteins are identical over 650/ <dig> aa when aligned using ncbi blastp. repeats  <dig> and  <dig> are both larger than the tlp <dig> genes with which they are associated. we hypothesize that the high percentage of nucleotide identity between repeats is sufficient to support recombination events leading to the large chromosomal rearrangements and subsequent invertible region.

the corresponding repeat  <dig> in nctc <dig>  associated with the locus cj <dig> encoding a tlp <dig> protein, is  <dig> nt; this repeat displays 99% identity over  <dig> nt with the first repeat in all four sequenced outbreak isolates. repeat  <dig> in nctc <dig>  associated with locus cj0262c encoding a tlp <dig> protein, is  <dig> nt in length, and has 1000/ <dig>  identity with the second repeat in the four outbreak isolates except for four indels. it is placed in reverse orientation relative to the first repeat in nctc <dig> similarly to the first two repeats in the four outbreak isolates. finally, repeat  <dig> in nctc <dig>  associated with locus cj1563c encoding tlp <dig>  is  <dig> nt compared with  <dig> nt for repeat  <dig> in the sequenced outbreak isolates. there is a 1951/ <dig>  nt identity between the nctc <dig> and outbreak-isolate tlp <dig> genes. studies are underway to investigate the diversity and extent of these repeat units within an expanded c. jejuni population and will be the subject of a separate report.

the maintenance of two sequence repeats flanking an invertible element may indicate that the element harbours genes subject to selective pressure. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that following an inversion event genes on the leading strand will now be switched to the lagging strand with respect to chromosomal replication, effectively changing the gene dosage  <cit> . inspection of the predicted protein identities for genes within the  <dig> kb invertible cassette revealed almost identical gene content, with very few exceptions . blast searches using nucleotide sequences of the 92-kb invertible region  of nctc11168 = atcc <dig> as the query sequence and the 93-kb invertible region of isolate 00– <dig> as the subject sequence identified a region with of 92130/ <dig>  identity with 23/ <dig> gaps , an expect value of  <dig> , and a blast score of  <dig> e +  <dig> bits . thus, despite the annotation differences, the gene/protein content of the two regions is highly similar. included among the loci encoded in the invertible element are a number of membrane proteins, chemotaxis proteins, rna-modifying enzymes, and a subset of iron acquisition proteins on the leading strand of the four c. jejuni isolates, some of which are proposed to have a functional role in environmental or niche adaptation. in contrast, the lagging strand  carried a large complement of transport proteins, including thetonb receptor and tonb transporter, exbb and exbd, among others.

outbreak isolates are characterized by a 93-kb chromosomal inversion but demonstrate variable ptet plasmid carriage
we were interested in determining whether the  <dig> kb inversion was a characteristic feature of isolates associated solely with the walkerton outbreak. not all isolates associated with the outbreak were previously typed by molecular typing methods or pfge  <cit>  though all were subjected to phage typing, hs typing, and hl typing  <cit> . therefore, maldi-tof was used to verify the species  of selected isolates , and mlst types were determined retrospectively for  <dig> additional c. jejuni isolates from the outbreak analysis. isolates from humans or bovine manure were considered to be associated with the outbreak strains  <cit>  if they were isolated during the outbreak investigation, considered epidemiologically outbreak-associated based on time and location, and belonged to cc st- <dig>  we were interested in identifying outbreak-strain markers for analysis of this particular outbreak or that could have been used to better characterize the campylobacter population in that particular geographical area at that time.

pcr detection of the 93-kb inversion indicated that the inversion was a characteristic of outbreak strains since it was detected in 97% of the human isolates and 100% of the cattle isolates , consistent with the clonal spread of the organism within the local cattle population and its subsequent introduction into humans through water  <cit> . the inversion was not prevalent in other cc st- <dig> isolates tested, though the numbers were small . the inversion was present at much lower frequencies in the relatively few non-walkerton-outbreak isolates available and was detected in an isolate of strain nctc <dig> which has been utilized for years in our laboratory as a reference strain for different investigations. together these results indicate that the 93-kb inversion was closely associated with the walkerton c. jejuni isolates and could be used as a secondary, confirmatory trait of outbreak isolates. although pcr detection of the inversion was highly effective and reliable as a tool in this instance, and could be rapidly used during an outbreak investigation, wgs-based analysis using the methods described in this paper were equally effective.table  <dig> detection of a 93-kb inversion in isolates associated with the walkerton outbreak investigation




the discovery of a ptet plasmid homolog in a single outbreak isolate was accomplished using two sets of pcr primers . amplicons for both primer sets were detected in 15% of the human walkerton cc st- <dig> isolates, increasing to 64% detection among walkerton cc st- <dig> isolates from cattle manure . the plasmid was detected at higher frequencies in non-walkerton cc st- <dig> isolates from humans and animals, as well as in c. coli  isolates from animals. it appeared that either the human population was less frequently infected with plasmid-containing strains from bovine feces or that the plasmid was readily lost upon human infection. in a minority of cases only one of the two amplicons was detected, suggesting some heterogeneity in the plasmid content or nucleotide changes within the primer binding sites. the plasmid was not a reliable marker for outbreak strains and appears to have been rapidly lost in the human population after infection with strains of bovine origin through contaminated water.table  <dig> detection of two pcr products from the ptet plasmid in walkerton outbreak investigation strains


c. coli



though data were limited, 7/ <dig> of the non-walkerton human cc st- <dig> isolates with the complete ptet plasmid belonged to two pfge types. of these, five had pfge patterns casai.0009-cakni. <dig> and were from new brunswick , québec , and ontario , while one each from québec and new brunswick had pfge patterns casai.0026-cakni. <dig>  this suggests the ptet plasmid may have been circulating in a geographically delimited reservoir of related isolates.

identification of a  <dig> kb inverted region
we hypothesized that additional chromosomal inversions could have arisen in c. jejuni due to homologous recombination events mediated by the high nucleotide identity observed among the three repeat elements identified in the sequenced outbreak isolates . pcr analysis using primers designed to bridge the junctions of each of these potential inversions was performed on a subset of c. jejuni and c. coli isolates , including isolates that did not harbour either the non-inverted sequence or the 93-kb inversion. only one isolate  produced an ~ <dig> kb amplicon using the cjinv <dig> primer set designed to specifically detect an inversion between gene homologs of cj0261c and cj1562- <dig> . sanger sequencing and blast analysis of this 3-kb product indicated that the amplified sequence was consistent with a ~ <dig> kb inversion between the tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> genes present in the four sequenced outbreak isolates. a third possible inversion of  <dig> kb located between repeats  <dig> and  <dig>  was not detected in this study. the sizes of the 388-kb inversion and potential 296-kb inversion would each be increased by  <dig> kb in isolate 00– <dig> due to the insertion of the cjie <dig> prophage .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the four outbreak isolates characterized in this work had closed, finished genomes with almost identical gene content, with the exception of a deletion of the cjie <dig> prophage, four additional trna loci in isolate 00– <dig>  and a hqsnv inactivating the threonine/serine transporter sstt. they also had the same homopolymeric tract content and location, minimal hqsnv variability, and limited cgmlst allelic variation, especially in the context of a larger population of st <dig> strains. these data provided strong support for the conclusions presented in earlier work that the strain-specific differences in cell culture adherence and invasion assays  <cit>  and protein expression  <cit>  resulted from the presence or absence of the cjie <dig> prophage. though artifacts may arise from the use of snv analysis with c. jejuni  <cit> , we found that both snv analysis and cgmlst delivered congruent results in that they clustered the four outbreak isolates closely together within the c. jejuni phylogenetic structure. both hqsnv analysis and cgmlst demonstrated consistent differences between isolates that were due to allelic differences at a small number of loci, supporting the hypothesis that they were changing rapidly as part of a freely recombining population. interpretation of whole genome sequence data relies on large datasets to allow conclusions about phylogenetic relationships to be drawn; a larger dataset was used for the cgmlst analysis, which enabled a much more detailed picture of phylogenetic relationships. crucial phylogenetic information not available using hqsnv analysis or cgmlst was provided by comparing the complete genomes of wgs strains, which contain the accessory genome for each strain, using whole genome neighbor-joining phylogenetic methods.

homopolymeric tracts are useful for assessing relationships among isolates
the locations of homopolymeric tracts were identical in the four outbreak strains and variable from other strains assessed. these observations were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among isolates determined in this work showing that the four walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates were related to, but distinct from, strain nctc <dig> . they also support our conclusions that 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig> are genetically almost identical and are most certainly clonally derived, thus highlighting the value of using comparisons of homopolymeric tract locations as an adjunct method to confirm phylogenetic relationships within c. jejuni. while the homopolymeric tract content and location may provide supporting data regarding the relatedness of strains for outbreak analysis, it seems unlikely that these data will supplant cgmlst and snv analysis for outbreak detection and analysis or investigations into population genetics of the organism.

changes in homopolymeric tract length affect expression of the genes with which they are associated and their association with different loci in different strains suggests that these homopolymeric tracts contribute to the adaptation of strains through selection in different environments or niches  <cit> . when population data are available, each of the homopolymeric tract length variants detected is best described as a proportion or percentage of the total population , and even individual strains of c. jejuni are a heterogeneous population of organisms capable of generating multiple phenotypes through adaptation to external or environmental conditions  <cit> . however, due to the high rate of mutation causing nucleotide changes in homopolymeric tracts  <cit>  snvs arising from changes in polyg/polyc tract lengths are not useful for phylogenetic or molecular epidemiologic analysis and it may be of merit to consider snv differences after removing them from the analysis  <cit> , as well as adjusting the lengths of the homopolymeric tracts to encode the full length protein when submitting sequence data to the ncbi.

potential significance of large chromosomal inversions
detection of large chromosomal inversions between chemotaxis proteins/tlps containing large conserved repeats indicates that c. jejuni genomes may be more dynamic than previously appreciated and suggests that this property may have adaptive consequences. chromosomal inversions may not be uncommon in c. jejuni and related organisms. in helicobacter pylori, an organism closely related to campylobacter spp., large chromosomal inversions were associated with insertion element is <dig>  or inverted copies of repeat  <dig>   <cit> . in c. jejuni strains, large genomic rearrangements induced by lytic bacteriophage predation resulted from recombination between two copies of the cjie <dig> mu-like bacteriophage  <cit> . one inversion characterized in this study was centered on the origin of replication and had measurable biological consequences that included increased survival in adverse ecological conditions. inversions between rrn operons in the genomes of specialist salmonella enterica serotypes typhi, paratyphi c, gallinarum, and pullorum have been detected at much higher rates than in the generalist s. typhimurium in spite of similar frequencies of inversion, an observation attributed to decreased survival of s. typhimurium due to selection pressures inherent to its generalist lifestyle  <cit> . c. jejuni associated with several sequence types, including st <dig>  have been described as generalists on the basis of phenotypic flexibility and high genetic microdiversity  <cit> . it is not clear whether this affects the frequency of chromosomal inversions in this organism, or whether there are chromosomal inversions mediated by rrn operons or other repeats detected in c. jejuni chromosomes. inversions that do not maintain the genome balance, defined as the lengths of replichores between the origin and terminus of replication, are also subject to selective pressure  <cit> . the  <dig> kb inversion we detected would likely not affect the genome balance except in the case of strain 00– <dig>  further investigations are necessary to determine whether the three repeats found in strains used in this study are restricted to only a subset of c. jejuni or are more generalized throughout the population, as well as whether the gene content of the 93-kb invertible region is relatively conserved or diverse in content. too few data were obtained to enable determination of an estimate of inversion frequencies between the repeats. it has been suggested previously that repeats separated by sequence comprising more than 10% of the chromosome length are rare, indicating strong counter selection against very large inversions  <cit> . higher rates of inversion would tend to homogenize a population distinguishable by other means, while lower rates may lead to increased temporal and geographic stability, thus enabling inversion status as a useful measure for population biology. this contention is supported by the results of experiments assessing the frequency of the  <dig> kb inversion in walkerton outbreak isolates.

differences in gene placement between the leading or lagging strand and differences in distance from the origin of replication that would result from inversion of the genomic segment, with possible concomitant gene dosage changes, may be associated with differences in gene and protein expression that would favor different lifestyles or environments. however, since the 93-kb inverted element is relatively small and close to the origin of replication there may not be sufficient difference in gene dosage to be of significance. this is a subject for future investigation.

analysis of complete, finished whole genome sequences of four outbreak isolates revealed chromosomal inversions and provided insight into the capability of using changes in homopolymeric tract locations as an estimator of isolate relatedness. the examination of whole genome sequences for properties in addition to those that assess phylogenetic relatedness for resolving outbreaks provides additional valuable insights into the biology of the organism. by closing and finishing a representative subset of outbreak genomes, we have been able to gain insight into the dynamics of the campylobacter genome, information that would not have been reliable or accurate using draft genomes alone. this analysis is anticipated to spur additional research into unravelling the intricacies of the campylobacter genome and augment our existing knowledge of outbreak-relevant genomic markers.
