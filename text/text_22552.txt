BACKGROUND
the shoot apical meristem  is a dynamic system that sustains production of plant organs while constantly integrating developmental and environmental cues 
 <cit> . the ability of the sam to process and buffer these cues is already evident during early stages of embryogenesis, when signals from different embryonic domains, including the vasculature and the epidermis, are integrated to qualitatively influence meristem growth 
 <cit> . many of these signals feed into a core negative feedback loop involving the transcription factor wuschel  and the clavata1/2/ <dig>  signaling complex, which act within the meristem to balance stem cell maintenance and cell differentiation 
.

in arabidopsis, mutations in ago <dig> and zll influence stem cell maintenance in the embryonic meristem and also during subsequent growth 
. the relationship between these two genes is complex, with studies indicating both synergistic and antagonistic functions 
. in general, ago proteins act as key mediators of small rna  silencing pathways by binding 21– <dig> nt srnas and inducing silencing of complementary rna or dna targets 
 <cit> . recent biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that in the embryo, zll acts as a mirna “locker” to sequester microrna165/ <dig>  thereby limiting its incorporation into the active ago <dig> rna-induced silencing complex  
 <cit> . in the absence of zll function, ago <dig> is proposed to bind mir165/ <dig> and down-regulate class iii hd-zip transcription factors within the embryonic sam, thereby inducing stem cell differentiation 
 <cit> . this pathway likely influences function of wus in promoting stem cell identity, since wus-induced clv <dig> expression in stem cells is disrupted in zll mutants 
 <cit> . zll function also appears to be linked to vascular tissues because provascular zll expression in the embryo is sufficient to maintain stem cell development, indicating that movement of small rnas or other signaling molecules may be involved 
 <cit> .

one intriguing aspect of the zll regulatory pathway is that zll mutants show sam stem cell defects in an accession-specific manner. while zll alleles isolated in the ler background show premature termination of stem cells 
 <cit> , putative null zll alleles in the col background, such as zllago10- <dig> <cit> , have no or minimal effects . furthermore, putative homozygous null mutants in ler display a variable expressivity of stem cell termination 
 <cit> . phenotypes range from an empty apex to a filamentous structure, a single leaf or two leaves in place of the sam, together with a fraction of individuals that develop a fully functional shoot meristem  
 <cit> . all of these mutant seedlings eventually produce adventitious meristems, flowers and seed, allowing them to be propagated and crossed as homozygotes. in an ems screen for modifiers of the col zllago10- <dig> allele, several genes and pathways that enhance zll function were identified, including mir <dig> 
 <cit> . this suggests that activity of multiple pathways can compensate for loss of zll activity. natural variation in early meristem development has previously been noted in maize, where knotted <dig> loss-of-function alleles show different degrees of embryonic meristem development in different inbred backgrounds

in this study we examined the effect of different genomic regions from ler and col on zll function in shoot stem cell maintenance. qtl analysis indicates that at least five loci, referred to as fletsche  1– <dig>  influence stem cell maintenance. comparison of embryo transcriptomic profiles identified multiple genes showing variable expression in different accessions, including candidates for the fhe loci. one of the candidates for fhe <dig> represents an allele of sqn, which encodes the arabidopsis cyclophilin- <dig> orthologue and acts as a modifier of zll function.

RESULTS
zll is required for meristem maintenance in an accession specific manner
the frequency of homozygous seedlings showing shoot stem cell termination in ler zll alleles varies from  <dig> to 90%, depending on the mutation 
 <cit> . by contrast, the putative null t-dna insertion mutants zllago10- <dig> and zllago10- <dig> in the col accession have no or minimal effects on stem cell maintenance and meristem development . to test if this difference is related to the nature of the respective mutant alleles, zllago10- <dig> was backcrossed three times to ler- <dig> wild-type. in homozygous ler zllago10- <dig> lines, 29%  of the seedlings showed stem cell termination. in a converse experiment, the strong zll- <dig> ems mutant allele was introduced into the col background by crossing ler zll- <dig> to col- <dig> wild-type. only a small fraction  of the expected 25% zll- <dig> homozygous f <dig> seedlings showed defects in stem cell maintenance . this equates to an approximate phenotype of 2% in the homozygous state, compared to 61%  in a cross between ler zll- <dig> and ler- <dig>  this indicates that the different expressivity of the zll- <dig> mutation between ler- <dig> and col alleles is not due to the nature of the mutant alleles, but must be caused by genetic modifiers. to determine if the different requirement for zll between ler and col might be due to the erecta mutation in ler, the col zllago10- <dig> allele was crossed to the strong er- <dig> and intermediate er- <dig> col alleles  
 <cit> . double mutants showed the characteristic erecta phenotype, but did not show an increased frequency of stem cell defects compared to the zllago10- <dig> single mutant.

differences in embryonic meristem size between ler and col were also investigated as a possible explanation for the different expressivity of zll mutations. because the number of l <dig> cells in the mature embryonic meristem is indicative of the size of the meristem, wild-type embryos from the ler- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions were stained with propidium iodide and examined by confocal laser microscopy . grown under the same conditions, ler- <dig> embryos  contained ~ <dig>   cells in the l <dig> layer of the meristem at maturity, while col- <dig> embryos  contained ~ <dig>   cells. this indicates that the l <dig> layer of the ler- <dig> embryonic meristem, and hence the meristem itself, contains more cells than the col- <dig> meristem . this opposes the hypothesis that a smaller meristem in ler- <dig> might be the cause of increased sensitivity to zll mutations, but suggests that fundamental differences in embryonic meristem regulation may contribute to variable zll expressivity in these accessions.

zll is required for meristem maintenance in multiple arabidopsis accessions
to determine if the differences in zll-dependency for stem cell maintenance are restricted to ler- <dig> and col- <dig>  the ler zll- <dig> allele was crossed to  <dig> different wild-type arabidopsis accessions originating from diverse countries . these accessions and others were analysed previously with  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  to address arabidopsis population structure 
 <cit> . analysis of  <dig> snps that produced clear genotypes in the  <dig> accessions used here confirmed that apart from the pairs of berkley and col- <dig>  and ct- <dig> and en- <dig>  the accessions were different .figure  <dig>

the frequency of seedling meristem termination, indicative of stem cell defects during embryogenesis, was assessed in the f <dig> generation of each accession cross to determine the approximate phenotypic frequency in the homozygous zll- <dig> state . of the  <dig> accessions, five showed stem cell termination in more than 20% of the homozygous seedlings, eight showed a phenotype in  <dig> to 20%, and fifteen showed a phenotype in less than 10% of seedlings. curiously, the five accessions that showed the highest zll- <dig> expressivity, ler- <dig>  freiburg- <dig> , neuweilnau- <dig> , bayreuth- <dig>  and enkheim- <dig> , were all derived from locations in the southern half of germany. despite this geographical association, there is no obvious clustering of these accessions in a phylogenetic tree based on  <dig> snps to suggest they were more related to each other than accessions showing weak stem cell termination phenotypes .

multiple quantitative trait loci  influence zll-dependent stem cell maintenance
to locate candidate modifiers in the arabidopsis genome, we utilized a population of ler/col recombinant inbred lines  
 <cit> . each line contains a different combination of ler- <dig> and col- <dig> genomic regions and has been genotyped, providing an excellent resource for mapping qtl. the ler zll- <dig> allele was crossed to  <dig> rils and the two parents, and f <dig> progeny were scored for stem cell termination phenotypes . the expectation from this cross was that rils containing ler- <dig> alleles at the position of putative qtl would show a higher frequency of seedlings with stem cell defects than lines containing col- <dig> alleles at the same position.figure  <dig>

on average, 684 f <dig> seedlings were scored for stem cell defects in each ril x ler zll- <dig> cross and the frequency was multiplied by  <dig> to determine the approximate frequency within the homozygous zll- <dig> population. values ranged from 1% to 61%  and the frequency of ril seedlings showing stem cell defects was used as the phenotype for qtl mapping. this identified five qtl , which are hereafter referred to as the fletsche  1– <dig> loci . the proportion of variance explained by the individual fhe loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and in total, the five fhe qtl explained 49% of the variance. the individual qtl effects ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  percent shoot termination and ler- <dig> always contributed the allele increasing the frequency of seedlings showing stem cell defects. the largest effect qtl was fhe <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig> at 32 cm.table  <dig>

near isogenic zll- <dig> lines  showing shoot stem cell defects preferentially retain genomic regions linked to the ler fhe loci
to further assess the contribution of fheler loci to stem cell maintenance, the zll- <dig> mutation was introgressed from ler to col. twenty independent f <dig> plants showing stem cell defects in the first backcross of ler zll- <dig> to col- <dig>  were further backcrossed to col- <dig> wild-type three to six times. in each backcross, f <dig> plants that showed stem cell defects at the seedling stage were selected for further backcrossing. at the same time, f <dig> seeds from self-fertilised siliques were harvested to assess the frequency of stem cell defects in the progeny. each backcross was expected to remove non-essential ler dna, while retaining ler genomic regions that enhance zll stem cell termination phenotypes. although some lines showed relatively stable levels of stem cell defects over several backcrosses , the majority showed a decrease with each subsequent backcross , consistent with the gradual accumulation of col- <dig> modifiers suppressing stem cell termination. this gradual decrease strongly indicates that multiple loci suppress stem cell termination in the col- <dig> accession in a quantitative manner.figure  <dig>

two lines  that maintained relatively high frequencies of stem cell termination over several backcrosses were selected for mapping and phenotypic analysis after bc <dig>  genomic dna from phenotypic nil <dig> bc5f <dig> plants  and nil <dig> bc5f <dig> plants  was used for bulk mapping with  <dig> pcr-based markers  that detect ler/col polymorphisms in the vicinity of the predicted fhe qtl and at unlinked sites throughout the genome. in both nils, pcr results identified a strong bias towards ler dna at markers mt <dig>  and nga <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and ciw <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  while the rest of the genome was biased towards col.

subsequent mapping of all individual phenotypic nil <dig> and nil <dig> bc5f <dig> plants revealed that a large region of genomic dna encompassing both fhe <dig> and fhe <dig>  approximately  <dig> cm in length, was preferentially maintained as homozygous or heterozygous ler  indicative of segregation distortion. a limited number of bc5f <dig> plants containing smaller regions of ler dna around the fhe <dig> and fhe <dig> loci were identified, and these were analysed in the bc5f <dig> to determine the specific effect of the ler fhe <dig> locus on stem cell termination . although homozygous ler dna at both fhe <dig> and fhe <dig> was not absolutely essential for stem cell termination, such plants showed a higher frequency of stem cell termination  in the bc5f <dig> compared to any other combination of fhe2/fhe <dig> dna . plants containing ler dna at fhe <dig> but not fhe <dig> , showed stem cell termination in  <dig> ± 2%  of homozygous zll-1seedlings. this is similar to the allele substitution effect estimated for fhe2ler in the ler/col ril population of  <dig> %. by contrast, no plants showing stem cell termination were identified containing homozygous ler dna only at fhe <dig> . of the phenotypic progeny derived from fhe2ler/colzll- <dig> parents, 70%  became homozygous fhe2ler/lerzll- <dig> in the bc5f <dig> generation compared with the expected 25% for random segregation. phenotypic fhe2ler/colfhe3ler/colzll- <dig> plants could only be identified at low frequency , and no phenotypic plants containing homozygous col dna at both fhe <dig> and fhe <dig> could be detected. collectively, these data suggest that the fhe2ler and to a lesser extent the fhe3ler loci encode quantitative modifiers of the zll stem cell termination phenotype.table  <dig>

changes in gene expression between zll-independent and dependent accessions identify candidates for the fhe loci and downstream pathways
despite further backcrosses, most zll- <dig> col nils preferentially retained a large fragment of ler genomic dna around fhe2ler which complicated fine mapping. to further delineate putative fhe factors and pathways that influence stem cell maintenance in a zll-dependent manner, microarray profiles were generated from specific zll-dependent and independent arabidopsis accessions using affymetrix ath <dig> chips.

torpedo-stage embryos were harvested separately from four zll-dependent accessions , and three zll-independent accessions . consistent with previous snp genotyping results 
 <cit> , none of the accessions showed an identical pattern when genotyped with  <dig> indel markers, confirming that they are genetically unique. multiple comparisons were made between expression profiles derived from the two groups of accessions by maintaining a minimum of three arrays per group. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as being differentially expressed in at least one of the comparisons, based on a p-value of < <dig>  and a 3-fold expression change . in the most stringent comparison, all of the zll-dependent accessions were grouped as replicates and compared to the zll-independent accessions. two genes were identified as being up-regulated and ten were identified as being down-regulated . none of the genes appeared to be tightly linked to the predicted fhe loci from the ril analysis, suggesting that they may either represent factors that act downstream of the fhe modifiers, they are unrelated to zll function, and/or they represent modifiers that escaped detection in the ler/col fhe qtl mapping.

fhe <dig> maps close to the arabidopsis cyclophilin- <dig> homologue squint, which is differentially expressed between col- <dig>  fe- <dig> and ler- <dig> accessions
expression profiles from col- <dig>  fe- <dig> and ler- <dig> were examined in greater detail to delineate putative fhe loci, because:  the qtl mapping data were derived from ler- <dig> and col- <dig>  and  fe- <dig> does not contain the erecta mutation, but it is the most likely accession to share similar fhe modifiers with ler- <dig> based on its high frequency of stem cell termination after zll- <dig> introgression. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between col- <dig> and fe-1/ler- <dig> . these were sorted based on their chromosomal position and compared to lists of genes residing approximately 5 cm either side of the putative fhe loci . on chromosome  <dig>  nineteen genes were identified that showed differential expression. four of these were located in the vicinity of the fhe <dig> qtl. three of the genes  were expressed at ~ <dig> to  <dig> fold lower levels in fe-1/ler- <dig> compared to col- <dig>  while the fourth gene  showed ~ <dig> fold higher expression in fe-1/ler- <dig> compared to col- <dig>  the three down-regulated genes encode a transposable element protein, an unknown protein and a pathogenesis-related lipid transfer protein, respectively. the fourth gene, which was located at the predicted physical position of the fhe <dig> qtl, encodes the arabidopsis homologue of cyclophilin- <dig>  also known as squint . sqn is involved in several stages of plant development, including the transition from juvenile to adult phase in the shoot meristem 
 <cit>  and floral meristem termination 
 <cit> , and has also been identified as a factor required for function of ago <dig> 
 <cit> . in the absence of sqn, mrna levels of mirna-regulated genes are increased and weak ago <dig> hypomorphic alleles resemble ago <dig> nulls, suggesting that the two proteins cooperate in the same pathway

changes in sqn expression influence stem cell maintenance in the ler- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions
based on the antagonistic roles of ago <dig> and zll in stem cell regulation, we speculated that increased sqn expression in ler- <dig> might enhance ago <dig> activity. in the absence of zll this could lead to stronger repression of ago <dig> targets  and subsequent stem cell termination. to test this model, we examined whether reduced sqn expression could alleviate meristem defects in ler zll- <dig> by crossing to the ler sqn- <dig> allele 
 <cit> . f <dig> plants homozygous for both sqn- <dig> and zll- <dig> were identified by pcr genotyping and their progeny was examined at the seedling stage. compared to zll- <dig> siblings, zll- <dig> sqn- <dig> double mutants displayed weaker stem cell termination phenotypes . in zll- <dig> plants, 56% of seedlings terminated with a single filamentous structure, while 18% terminated with one or two leaves. in contrast, only 34% of zll- <dig> sqn- <dig> plants terminated with a single filament, while 58% terminated with one or two leaves.table  <dig>

because sqn- <dig> is a weak allele that may only partially reduce sqn activity by modifying the c’-terminus of the predicted sqn protein 
 <cit> , an artificial mirna was designed to further down-regulate sqn mrna levels. in zll- <dig> sqn- <dig> double mutants, amirsqn suppressed stem cell defects and enhanced the frequency of a wild type-like shoot meristem in seedlings up to  <dig> % . in a reciprocal experiment, to address whether lower levels of sqn in zll-independent accessions such as col- <dig> may be a reason for the absence of stem cell defects, sqn was ectopically expressed from the strong embryonic patrps5a promoter in the col zllago10- <dig> mutant. this construct induced stem cell termination in up to  <dig> % of zllago10- <dig> transgenic plants . taken together, these results suggest that different sqn expression levels in the ler and col accessions determine differences in stem cell termination in the absence of zll function, and that sqn is a strong candidate for a gene underlying the fhe <dig> qtl.table  <dig>

discussion
different genetic backgrounds influence the role of zll in stem cell maintenance
previous studies in arabidopsis have utilised variation between natural accessions to identify the genetic basis for developmental differences 
 <cit> , including small rna-mediated regulation of flowering time 
 <cit> , self-incompatibility 
 <cit>  and root growth 
 <cit> . in the current study, natural genetic modifiers that influence stem cell maintenance in the absence of zll function were investigated. the aim was to identify novel components that support zll in promoting stem cell maintenance through the regulation of wus activity 
 <cit>  and/or modification of mirna function 
 <cit> . qtl mapping in a population of ler/col rils and zll- <dig> col- <dig> nils suggested that five fhe loci can explain 49% of the variance in stem cell maintenance in ler- <dig> and col- <dig>  in all cases, the presence of the ler fhe alleles with zll- <dig> resulted in an increased frequency of stem cell termination, consistent with col zll mutants showing limited degrees of stem cell termination. the ler/col rils were previously analysed for variation in shoot regeneration from tissue culture, which depends on three qtl on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 
 <cit> . the position of these loci is distinct from the fhe qtl, suggesting that the fhe loci are unlikely to be involved in shoot formation per se, and are more likely to be involved in embryonic meristem function.

our findings also indicate that differences in zll-dependency are not limited to the col- <dig> and ler- <dig> accessions and considerable variation exists between different accessions from north america, europe and asia. the two accessions showing the highest frequency of stem cell defects in the presence of zll- <dig>  in 55% and 61% of zll- <dig> seedlings respectively, were fe- <dig> and ler- <dig>  limited information is available for the fe- <dig> accession, but previous studies of natural genetic variation show that it diverges from ler and col in its response to pathogen susceptibility 
 <cit> . no obvious phenotypic differences in growth habit, flower development or embryo morphology were detected between fe- <dig> and col- <dig> to suggest such a prominent difference in response to loss of zll function.

although our analyses are far from saturating, most zll-dependent accessions analysed here were collected from regions within middle and southern germany. recent advances in snp detection and the availability of large genomic sequence datasets from diverse accessions allows trait variation to be dissected by genome wide association studies , which offers a much higher mapping resolution compared to the rils 
. the number of accessions analysed in this experiment was insufficient for robust gwas, but such an approach might be useful in future studies to fine map the fhe loci and to identify additional loci that contribute to zll function in stem cell maintenance. identification of the genes underlying the fhe qtl will show whether the zll-dependent accessions share a common recent ancestor containing a set of genetic modifications influencing stem cell maintenance, or if geographical conditions have independently influenced selection of polymorphisms in the modifier loci.

conserved differences in embryonic gene expression are detected between different arabidopsis accessions
the first defects in stem cell maintenance in zll- <dig> mutants are observed at the torpedo stage of embryogenesis 
 <cit> , suggesting that fhe modifiers of zll function should be active at this stage. microarray analysis identified multiple genes showing natural variation in embryonic gene expression at the torpedo-stage. these expression profiles suggest it is unlikely that any causative polymorphisms influencing zll-dependency in the seven analysed accessions lead to common changes in mrna expression of the genes underlying the ler/col fhe loci. this is not surprising, since the fhe qtl may differ between diverged accessions and the specific polymorphism leading to zll-dependency may not lead to a change in mrna expression, but rather have effects on protein function or accumulation.

of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the combined zll-dependent versus zll-independent accessions, none were tightly linked to the ler/col fhe loci or had documented functions in meristem development or rnai. in addition, only two of the genes showed any expression correlation across a developmental series , suggesting that the group are unlikely to be associated closely in the same pathway. despite this, it is possible that variable expression of these genes in the different accessions is at least partly dependent on activity of the fhe loci. this is also possible for the remaining  <dig> genes that showed accession-specific expression during embryogenesis.

a hypomorphic squint allele may support stem cell maintenance in columbia zll mutants
restricting the embryonic expression profile comparisons to the three most relevant accessions , in combination with double mutant analysis, identified sqn as a candidate modifier underlying the fhe <dig> qtl. in col- <dig>  embryonic sqn expression is 5-fold lower than ler- <dig> and fe- <dig>  consistent with a role in modifying stem cell development, decreased sqn activity in ler via sqn- <dig> and amirsqn partially rescued stem cell maintenance in the zll- <dig> background, while increased sqn expression in col zllago10- <dig> induced stem cell termination. although the effects were greater than the predicted quantitative contribution of the fhe <dig> qtl, this may be due to the nature of the polymorphisms between sqnler and sqncol. only synonymous snps are present in the sqn coding sequence between ler- <dig> and col- <dig>  indicating that differences in enzyme amino acid sequence cannot explain differences in function. in contrast, significant variations including insertions and deletions are present in the 5’ sequence upstream of the sqn gene . notably, a  <dig>  kb mule-related transposon sequence, annotated as at2g15800/at2g <dig>  is inserted close to the transcriptional start site of sqn. this insertion is located 500 bp upstream of the predicted sqn start codon in col- <dig> but is absent from ler- <dig> . the presence of this insertion varies between arabidopsis accessions 
 <cit> , and may contribute to natural variation in sqn expression as detected for other genes tightly linked to transposon sequences 
 <cit> .

although variable sqn expression levels correlate with differences in stem cell maintenance in ler- <dig>  fe- <dig> and col- <dig>  and to a lesser extent in the bay- <dig> and nw- <dig> accessions, this is not the case in all accessions examined. sqn mrna levels in the zll-independent ts- <dig> and van- <dig> lines were unchanged relative to fe-1/ler- <dig>  therefore, alternative fhe loci may play a more important role in these accessions. it is possible that some of this variation may be due to subtle transcriptional or post-transcriptional changes in the function of other meristem or rnai-related genes physically linked to the fhe loci reported here . further analysis of f <dig> progeny from ler zll- <dig> and ts- <dig> or van- <dig> crosses will allow the major fhe loci that influence stem cell maintenance in these accessions to be positioned.

CONCLUSIONS
our current model for fhe <dig> function is based upon a conserved increase in sqn mrna levels in ler- <dig> and fe- <dig> compared to col- <dig>  sqn is predicted to enhance ago <dig> activity through function as a co-factor 
 <cit> . in combination with a zll mutation, which allows ago <dig> greater access to mir165/ <dig>  increased levels of sqn in ler- <dig> enhance repression of ago <dig> targets, such as the class iii hd-zips, and lead to a high frequency of terminal stem cell differentiation. conversely in col- <dig>  where embryonic sqn expression is 5-fold lower than fe-1/ler- <dig>  ago <dig> is less efficient at reducing class iii hd-zip expression and inducing stem cell termination in the absence of zll function. in line with this, col zllago10- <dig> mutants showed no detectable change in class iii hd-zip mrna levels or other mirna targets compared to col- <dig> wild-type , despite containing a functional ago <dig> gene 
 <cit> . only when embryonic sqn expression was increased via the atrps5a:sqn construct did a high frequency of col zllago10- <dig> seedlings show meristem termination. although changes in sqn expression alone cannot account for the drastic differences between zll phenotypes in col- <dig> and ler- <dig>  it is likely that sqn forms part of an important pathway that contributes to zll function and fhe activity during stem cell development. further characterisation of the fhe loci using emerging genomic and genetic resources, in combination with second-site mutagenesis studies in zllago10- <dig>  will aid the identification of the responsible loci as well as determine their conservation in diverged arabidopsis accessions.
