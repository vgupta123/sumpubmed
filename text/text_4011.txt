BACKGROUND
hiv- <dig> derived lentiviral vectors efficiently transfer genes and mediate long-term gene expression in non-dividing cells  <cit> . these properties make lentiviral vectors attractive candidates for the correction of inherited liver disorders. lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus  can efficiently transduce primary hepatocytes in vitro  <cit> . in contrast, in vivo lentiviral vector delivery in rodents results in relatively poor gene transfer to hepatocytes because nonparenchymal liver cells are preferentially transduced  <cit> . we have previously shown that the main target of vsvg pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are liver macrophages, the kupffer cells  <cit> . although depletion of kupffer cells leads to a significant increase in the gene transfer to hepatocytes  <cit>  it would be preferable to develop lentiviral vectors that are less efficiently sequestered by macrophages. this would make more virus available for hepatocyte transduction and could also reduce the immune response to the viral vector and vector products.

lentiviral vectors are commonly pseudotyped with vsvg which generates stable virions capable of transducing a broad range of cells both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . however, because this broad transduction range is not desireable in many applications, the use of alternative envelopes is investigated. the envelope protein from the baculovirus autographica californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosisvirus, gp <dig>  is also able to efficiently pseudotype lentiviral vectors  <cit> . gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors exhibit comparable tropism and viral titers as that of vsvg, but with reduced cellular toxicity  <cit> . a comparison of in vivo gene transfer of lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with either vsvg or gp <dig> showed comparable transduction profiles in murine livers  <cit> . thus, although earlier reports showed that baculovirus based vectors displayed a hepatocyte tropism <cit> , pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the baculoviral gp <dig> protein does not appear to enhance hepatocyte gene transfer in vivo.

the engineering of retroviral envelope proteins for retargeting represent a challenge as modifications to viral envelope proteins often results in a significant reduction in viral titers  <cit> . gp <dig> seems to tolerate peptide insertions better than other viral envelopes and is therefore an attractive platform for the generation of targeted viruses. in baculovirus, amino terminal fusions to the gp <dig> envelope protein have been used for the surface display of; gfp  <cit> , functional single chain antibody fragments  <cit> , plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein  <cit> , avidin  <cit> , and gp <dig> from hiv  <cit> . lentiviral vectors can also be pseudotyped with engineered gp <dig> proteins, decay accelerating factor was fused to the amino terminus of gp <dig> and incorporated into lentiviral vector particles  <cit> . we have recently shown that gp <dig> can be used for the surface display of a peptide from the hepatitis b virus pres <dig> protein resulting in pseudotyped lentiviral vectors with preferential gene transfer to liver derived cells  <cit> .

the sendai virus fusion  protein utilizes a hepatocyte specific receptor for viral entry  <cit> . both murine retroviral  <cit>  and lentiviral vectors  <cit>  could be pseudotyped with the sv-f protein, resulting in hepatocyte specific gene transfer, but viral particles were unstable and viral titers were too low to proceed to in vivo studies. we constructed a sendai-gp <dig> fusion protein and investigated the tropism of lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with this envelope protein for hepatocytes and macrophages in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
construction of sendai-gp <dig> chimeric envelope protein
the sendai virus fusion protein  is expressed as an inactive precursor protein f <dig>  which is cleaved by a cellular protease to a f <dig> and f <dig> chain  <cit>  . a fragment containing the f <dig> domain and fusion peptide was fused to the amino terminus of gp <dig> . the resulting fusion gene of sv-f and gp <dig>  sendai-gp <dig>  was verified by both restriction fragment analysis and sequencing.

to investigate expression levels and incorporation into virus particles, sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles were examined by western blotting. the monoclonal antibody  directed against gp <dig> gave the expected band for the wild type gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors , but did not react with virus pseudotyped with sendai-gp <dig> recombinant protein . this was unexpected because sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are capable of transducing cells and sendai-gp <dig> contains the full length gp <dig> cdna. however, the sendai-gp <dig> fusion protein does not contain the native gp <dig> signal peptide and this may lead to differential posttranslational modifications abrogating binding of the acv <dig> gp <dig> antibody. a new fusion protein was created where the sendai fusion f <dig> domain was inserted after the native signal peptide of gp <dig>  sendai-spgp <dig>  analysis of sendai-spgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral particles on western blot produced a band migrating at the predicted size for the fusion protein . however, compared to wtgp <dig>  staining intensity of the sendai-spgp <dig> protein was low. the identity of the low molecular mass band is unclear because it was not consistently present in western blots of concentrated gp <dig> virus. this lower band might therefore represent a degradation product of gp <dig>  but could also be aspecific staining as more viral particles were loaded in the lane with sendai-gp <dig> and sendai-spgp <dig> 

pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with sendai-gp <dig> fusion proteins
lentiviral vectors expressing gfp from the pgk promoter were produced with wtgp <dig>  sendai-gp <dig>  or sendai-spgp <dig> viral envelope proteins. viral titers were determined on both hela  and hepg <dig>  cells. lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with gp <dig> can efficiently transduce both hela and hepg <dig> cells, while both sendai-gp <dig> and sendai-spgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were only able to transduce hepg <dig> cells. thus, both chimeric envelope vectors displayed a higher affinity for hepg <dig> cells as compared to wtgp <dig> . viral titers on hepg <dig> cells with sendai-gp <dig> and sendai-spgp <dig> vectors were approximately  <dig> orders of magnitude lower than those obtained with wild type gp <dig> .

lentiviral vectors were pseudotyped with: wild type gp <dig>  sendai-gp <dig> fusion protein, or generated with a mix of 29: <dig> of fusion- to wild type gp <dig> expression vector,, were used to transduce hela cervical carcinoma cells, hepg <dig> hepatoma cells and raw macrophages.

viral titers were determined using unconcentrated lentiviral vectors from at least two different virus preparations and are expressed as the amount of transducing units per ml. specificity was calculated as the ratio of titers on hepg <dig> and hela cells and as the ratio of titers on raw macrophages and hela cells.

bnot determined.

the titers of lentiviral vectors with either the sendai-gp <dig> or sendai-spgp <dig> envelope alone were too low for in vivo use. therefore, to increase viral titers, lentiviral vectors were produced with wtgp <dig> and either sendai-gp <dig> or sendai-spgp <dig> envelope proteins. the ratio of wtgp <dig> to sendai-gp <dig> or sendai-spgp <dig> plasmid used during virus production were optimised to yield lentiviral vectors that had high titers on hepg <dig> cells while retaining a reduced affinity for hela cells. the specificities of viruses produced with different ratio's of wild type gp <dig> and sendai-gp <dig> are shown in table  <dig> 

the ratio's 2: <dig>  9: <dig>  29: <dig>  99: <dig> refer to the relative amount of sendai-gp <dig> to gp <dig> plasmid used for transfection during virus production. viral titers were determined using unconcentrated lentiviral vectors from at least three different virus preparations.

we have previously shown that kupffer cells  are the predominant cell type transduced within the liver  <cit> . therefore, it was important to determine the relative affinity of sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors for macrophages. the mouse macrophage cell line raw, was used as model to assess the relative gene transfer efficiency of our chimeric lentiviral vectors as compared to wtgp <dig>  wild type gp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were capable of gene transfer to this macrophage cell line, but titers were lower than those on hepg <dig> cells. however, sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> chimeric lentiviral vectors had even lower titers on raw cells , suggesting that sendai-gp <dig> virus is detargeted from macrophages. the higher affinity for a hepatoma cell line  and reduced gene transfer to macrophages  suggests that only sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> and not sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors would exhibit improved hepatocyte specificity in vivo.

significant reduction in gene transfer to nonparenchymal liver cells in vivo with sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors
male fvb mice  <dig> to  <dig> weeks old were injected intraportally with identical amounts of infectious virions,  <dig>  ×  <dig> hepg <dig> transducing units, of gp <dig> , sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> , or sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig>  pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. one week following viral injections, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were fixed in vivo. liver sections were prepared from the left and medial lobes and gfp expression was directly observed using fluorescence microscopy. in liver sections of mice injected with wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors, the majority of transduced liver cells were nonparenchymal cells , as previously described <cit> . staining of these sections with the f4/ <dig> antibody confirmed that the majority of transduced non parenchymal cells are liver macrophages, the kupffer cells. . strikingly, in the liver sections from sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vector injected mice but not in thet sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> injected mice, the ratio of gfp expressing hepatocytes to nonparenchymal liver cells was much higher .

counting of gfp positive cells in liver sections showed a significant reduction  in the amount of transduced nonparenchymal liver cells in mice injected with sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors as compared to wtgp <dig> . sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> injected mice had approximately two fold less gene transfer to hepatoctyes and liver nonparenchymal cells compared to wtgp <dig> treated mice . the ratio of gfp positive hepatocytes to non-parenchymal liver cells of sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors is three fold increased as compared to both wtgp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> .

lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with wild type gp <dig> or mixes of wild type gp <dig> and sendai-gp <dig> fusion proteins were generated and concentrated as described.

mice were injected in the portal vein with  <dig>  ×  <dig> hepg <dig> transducing units of each virus. after one week frozen fixed liver sections were prepared from the medial and left lobes and gfp positive cells were counted using a fluorescence microscope.

npc: nonparenchymal liver cells.

specificity was calculated as the ratio of gfp positive hepatocytes/mm <dig> to gfp positive npc/mm <dig> and indicates relative affinity for hepatocytes.

a represents a significant difference  between wtgp <dig> and sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> transduced animals. b represents a significant difference  between wtgp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> transduced animals.

our observation that sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have a reduced affinity for raw macrophages in vitro is thus confirmed by the lower transduction of liver macrophages in vivo.

to validate the microscopy data, pcr amplification specific for integrated lentiviral vectors was performed on genomic dna isolated from the liver. in the sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> injected animals a weaker band is observed in liver genomic dna, validating the results from the counting of gfp expressing cells in liver sections . unfortunately, transduction levels were too low for accurate quantitative pcr.

discussion
we report the first use of an amino terminal fusion to gp <dig> for the targeting of lentiviral vectors in the liver. the f <dig> domain of the sendai virus fusion protein was fused to the amino terminus of gp <dig> and used to pseudotype lentiviral vectors. lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the sendai-gp <dig> and sendai-spgp <dig> fusion envelope were no longer able to transduce hela cells, but were still able to transduce hepg <dig> cells . viral titers were increased by co-production of both wild type gp <dig> and sendai-gp <dig> , in agreement with previous reports of gp <dig> fusion proteins both in baculoviral  <cit>  and lentiviral vectors  <cit> . the presence of wild type gp <dig> may increase incorporation of sendai-gp <dig> proteins into viral particles through a chaperone function or it may restore fusion activity that could be lost due to the addition of the sv-f <dig> domain  <cit> .

although sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were capable of gene transfer, we were unable to detect expression of this chimeric fusion protein in viral particles and lysates of transfected cells  by western blot. this was surprising because the sendai-gp <dig> construct contains the full length gp <dig> cdna with exclusion of the signal peptide.

lentiviral vectors produced without a viral envelope protein lack the ability to bind and fuse to target cells and are not capable of gene transfer in hepg <dig> cells under our experimental conditions . thus, a functional envelope protein must be incorporated in the sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped virions. the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that different posttranslational processing of sendai-gp <dig> results in disruption of epitopes that are recognised by the antibody on wild type gp <dig> 

sendai-gp <dig> uses the sendai virus signal peptide, when we constructed a sendai-gp <dig> fusion protein that uses the gp <dig> signal peptide we were able to detect low levels of sendai-spgp <dig> on western blot  suggesting that the removal of the native gp <dig> signal peptide in sendai-gp <dig> may effect protein processing and explain the loss of reactivity with the gp <dig> specific antibody acv <dig> 

using the raw mouse macrophage cell line as model for kupffer cells, we showed that while wild type gp <dig> lentiviral vectors can efficiently transduce these cells, sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors transduce these macrophages with very low efficiency . when administered in vivo, sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors exhibited a significant reduction of gene transfer to kupffer cells . interestingly, sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced raw mouse macrophages with a similar efficiency as wild type gp <dig> alone  and this correlated well with increased gene transfer to kupffer cells in vivo . these data suggest that raw mouse macrophages are a good model for assessing the gene transfer to liver kupffer cells in vivo.

we evaluated three different pseudotyped lentiviral vectors  for in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes in murine livers. using gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors as a reference, we observed a significant reduction in gene transfer to liver nonparenchymal cells with the sendai-gp64/wtgp <dig> and sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors . mice receiving sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> lentiviral vectors had a two fold reduction in both hepatocyte and liver nonparenchymal cell gene transfer. the sendai-spgp64/wtgp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors displayed a lower in vitro specificity for hepg <dig> cells  and this in part may explain the lower gene transfer efficiency observed.

the titers of sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are low and must be improved to be suitable for practical use. inserting the sendai fragment into a different site of gp <dig> or using a directed evolution approach might result in new and improved hybrid viral envelopes.

hepatocyte specific gene transfer using gp <dig> pseudotyped feline immunodeficient virus  derived lentiviral vectors has been described  <cit> . this hepatocyte specific gene transfer was not observed in our gp <dig> pseudotyped hiv derived lentiviral vectors  and in a previously published comparison of vsvg and gp <dig> pseudotyped hiv lentiviral vectors  <cit> . in both cases there is significant gene transfer to nonparenchymal liver cells. differences in lentiviral vector systems and marker gene may explain these differences. in our hands, decreased nonparenchymal liver cell gene transfer was only observed with chimeric lentiviral vectors produced with wtgp <dig> and either sendai-gp <dig> or sendai-spgp <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that it is possible to redirect in vivo gene transfer through manipulations to the gp <dig> envelope protein. further improvements in gp <dig> fusion proteins allowing for higher levels of expression may eventually lead to hybrid envelope proteins with complete retargeting without the need to co-express wild type gp <dig> envelope protein.
