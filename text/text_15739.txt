BACKGROUND
investigations in molecular biology frequently require the analysis of sequence alignments and several methods are available for this purpose. once a correct alignment is obtained, inferences may be made concerning phylogenetic relationships and putative functions  <cit> . a fundamental problem arises when accurate sequence alignments cannot be obtained due to poor similarity, which may occur with homologous or analogous genes  <cit> . homologous genes, comprising orthologs  and paralogs  share common ancestry; however, sequence similarity may be low when they are rapidly evolving, evolutionary distant, or the sequences have significant nucleotide biases. analogous genes have similar functions, but arise from convergent evolution and the absence of shared ancestry means there is little or no sequence similarity  <cit> .

to address the limitation of poor sequence similarity in homologous or analogous sequences, a novel alignment strategy was conceptualized and the fire  algorithm developed. this method uses the evolutionary rate at codon sites, rather than individual residues, to align sequences. evolutionary pressures are inferred from the parameter ω  to synonymous  substitutions, corrected for opportunity)  <cit> , which is typically used to investigate darwinian selection at the molecular level. a non-synonymous rate significantly greater that the synonymous rate, ω  >  <dig>  reflects positive selection, while neutral and purifying selection are inferred when ω =  <dig>  and ω < <dig>  respectively. the evolutionary rate may vary across whole coding sequences, at individual codons within a sequence or along branches within a phylogenetic tree and numerous evolutionary models and software statistical packages for performing the analyses are available. for a recent overview of the subject see  <cit> . the method reported here makes use of the evolutionary rate at codon sites to align sequences and demonstrates the potential to infer protein domain function in sequences that are subject to similar evolutionary constraints.

RESULTS
conceptualization
the aim of this study was to address the limitation of poor similarity when performing sequence alignments. the traditional approach of using the positional homology of residues to align sequences was therefore abandoned and the parameter ω employed instead. the question we asked is: can the selective pressures acting at codon sites across coding sequences, and not residue positional homology, be used to perform alignments? to investigate this question, we aligned homologous domains , which typically have similar functions, using ω values at codon sites across the sequences. next, if sequences with similar functions can be aligned using evolutionary rates, we tested the hypothesis that this approach may be used to infer protein domain function in the absence of significant sequence similarity. domains with poor sequence similarity but similar function  were employed for this purpose.

algorithm
the fire algorithm was developed in order to perform a pairwise alignment using ω mles . the ω mles at codon sites were obtained from multiple sequence alignments  of closely related orthologous sequences  and fire is therefore, in essence, aligning two msas or clades. fire was modified from the needleman-wunsch algorithm  <cit>  and finds the pairwise alignment using the codon alignment  to maximize the similarity metric. a codon score, cs, measures the similarity between two aligned ω values in the range  <cit> . the maximum difference between two ω values is capped to ωmax and is parameterized - we chose  <dig>  as a default, since it is biologically more meaningful to identify sites under positive selection than to emphasize the absolute values of sites with ω> <dig>  thus, cs =  <dig>  if |ω1-ω2|>ωmax and cs = 1-/ωmax otherwise. the fire score is the sum of the cs scores over all aligned codon pairs, normalized for sequence length by dividing the fire score by the number of codons in the longer sequence. the opening and extension gap penalties are parameterized and the defaults of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were used for the analyses in this study. the fire algorithm produces a normalized score, percentage similarity plot, histogram listing the number of codons in the alignment with similar scores per decile, and an alignment of the amino acid sequences. the fire software and a user information file providing further details are freely available at http://dept.ee.wits.ac.za/~scott/fire and are attached as additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

testing
data sets
the bayes empirical bayes  or naïve empirical bayes  posterior mean ω mles at codon sites were obtained for  <dig> data sets using the paml  v <dig>  software  <cit>  and a fire alignment of each data set with every other set was performed . data sets included the following domains:  a highly conserved transcription factor myb <dig> dna-binding domain   <cit> ;  myb <dig>  a paralog of myb1;  a conserved tumor suppressor p <dig> dbd  <cit> ;  a metabolic enzyme glycerol kinase   <cit> ; and  light chain antibody variable regions  <cit> . variations in the following parameters were present across data sets and did not adversely affect paml or fire analyses: domain length , ω mle range , dn range , and paralogous sequences . the number of sequences per data set ranged from 4- <dig>  the data sets with low sequence number were used to examine the effect of this on fire outputs, and as expected, sets with fewer sequences produced less accurate ω mles and decreased fire reliability. sequence divergence  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which is within paml suggested limits of < <dig>  <cit> . an exception was the protozoan myb <dig> set ; however, it is unlikely this led to erroneous results since high ds values falsely elevate ω values and in this set all the ω mles were < <dig> .

data analysis
the results of salient examples are discussed. fire scores and similarity plots are provided in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively, and the corresponding fire alignments are documented in additional file  <dig>  the results presented were obtained for ω mles obtained from paml analyses under model m <dig> . in general, fire results for ω mles with model m <dig> were the same or better than m <dig>  the likely reason being that ω mles under m <dig> are less constrained.

the results of  <dig> fire alignments of the ω mles derived from two sequence sets are shown. the range of ω mles at codon sites  includes values for both data sets, and was taken from model m <dig> results. fire plots and alignments for sets marked with asterisk  are provided in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. the two κ data sets  represent different κ sequences. metazoan and protozoan gk data sets differed by > <dig> codons and therefore produced a relatively low fire alignment score . dna-binding domains were used for myb and p <dig> alignments. sets 7- <dig> are negative controls. gk = glycerol kinase; vr = variable region.

following normalization for sequence length, homologous domains with similar functions produced fire scores > <dig>  and fire plots with the majority of codon similarities >60%. for example, alignments for two orthologous sets  and two paralogous sets  produced scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and similarity plots nearing 100% over most of the sequence. the metazoan gk/protozoan gk alignment provided a comparison of two orthologous sets with a greater range in ω mles, significantly different sequence lengths  and non-contiguous evolutionary conserved codons  <cit> . the difference in sequence length is responsible for the relatively low score , which is reflected by the gaps in the plot . removing the gaps prior to performing a fire alignment increased the score to  <dig> .

conserved domains with dissimilar functions produced poor alignments, for example the metazoan myb1/gk alignment . the myb1/p <dig> dbd alignment provided an interesting test case. both are transcription factors, however, the domains are implicated in very different biological functions and, according to our hypothesis, this difference should result in a poor fire alignment. this was indeed the case . we did, however, note that fire produced false positives when two unrelated highly conserved domains  of similar lengths were aligned . including other computational methods such as structure determination would be valuable to identify these cases.

the effect of sites under strong positive selection on this approach was observed from alignments that included antibody sets. as a result of positive selection, antibody sequences of the variable region demonstrate poor sequence similarity. despite this, the fire scores , plots and alignments between the two κ sets, and the κ and λ sets suggested that these domains are under similar evolutionary pressures, which correlates with their similar functions. alignments of the κ and λ antibody sets with any of the domains that are functionally unrelated, for example myb <dig>  gk or p <dig>  produced poor fire results.

fire performance
to compare the performance of fire against the more conventional clustalw  <cit> , mafft  <cit>  and structure-based t-coffee  <cit>  algorithms for the data sets in table  <dig>  we employed sequence-structure alignments  as an independent standard of truth. fatcat   <cit>  and dali   <cit>  algorithms, which differ in their treatments of flexible structures, were used to align data sets 1- <dig>  based on structures extracted from the worldwide protein data bank  <cit> . as a measure of performance, the proportions of correctly aligned residue pairs  obtained by fire, t-coffee, clustalw and mafft alignments were determined using fatcat or dali as the reference alignment. for example, in data set  <dig> fatcat aligned  <dig> pairs of residues, and using this as the reference alignment, the proportions correctly aligned by fire, t-coffee, clustalw and mafft were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. irrespective of whether fatcat or dali was used as the reference alignment, fire, t-coffee, clustalw and mafft produced similar performances. results with fatcat as the reference alignment are summarized in table  <dig> and data set  <dig> is provided as an alignment example in figure  <dig> 

performances of the fire, t-coffee, clustalw and mafft algorithms were measured by determining the proportion of correctly aligned residue pairs using fatcat and dali structure-based alignments as a reference. fire is independent of homology and performed better than clustalw for data sets  <dig> and  <dig> , illustrating the value of using this approach when sequence similarities are low. this independence from residues in the sequence may also lead to relatively poor fire performance when sequence similarity is high, for example set  <dig>  t-coffee and mafft performed best overall . the pdb structure files included in fatcat, dali and t-coffee algorithms are set 1: 2dim, 2k9n; set 2: 2dim, 2din; set 3: 2yum, 2k9n; set 4: 1bo5; set 5: 5lve, 1qp1; set 6: 1lve, 1nc <dig>  *due to a lack of structural data for set  <dig>  the fugue threading algorithm  <cit>  was used to generate a reference structure alignment from the e. histolytica sequence  using e. coli glycerol kinase  as a template. for all alignments, fatcat and dali produced similar results and only the fatcat data are shown.

the t-coffee and mafft algorithms performed the same or better than fire or clustalw for all data sets. the t-coffee performance is unsurprising since  the same structure files used by fatcat and dali were included in the t-coffee algorithm, and  it is well known that structure-based alignments or a combination of structural information with other approaches  produce the most accurate alignments when sequence similarity is low  <cit> . although t-coffee and mafft are state-of-the art methods and known to perform well, it is worth noting that in data sets  <dig> and  <dig>  the performances of the three homology-based algorithms  may be inflated relative to fire due to the presence of short stretches of conserved residues involved in stabilizing the tertiary structures of the antibody light chains. it was also observed that fire performed better than clustalw in these same data sets, demonstrating the value of aligning sequences based on evolutionary rates when sequence similarity is low. one shortcoming of the fire algorithm is that the performance may actually decrease when sequence similarity is high. the likely reason is that if the two sequences being aligned share a long stretch of very low ω mles, such as occurs in highly conserved domains like the myb transcription factor in data set  <dig>  there is a risk that a gap  is introduced causing a misalignment over the conserved region.

the main findings from these results indicate that it is conceptually and methodologically possible to align functionally similar domains accurately using the evolutionary rate at codon sites. in addition, good alignment scores were only obtained for sequences coding for similar functions, indicating that domains with similar functions are subject to similar evolutionary constraints. this suggests that the fire approach may be valuable for inferring domain function in situations such as convergent evolution or when sequences are highly divergent. however, it was noted that for homologous genes where there is some sequence similarity, fire was not as accurate as mafft or t-coffee. in these cases, the conventional algorithms remain the method of choice.

implementation
the value of the fire approach currently lies in its ability to align sequences independent of residue similarity. this is helpful for analyzing sequences with poor similarity, which typically occurs with evolutionary distant genes, convergent evolution and sequences with extreme nucleotide biases  <cit> . it is known that structure-based methods are also valuable in these circumstances and it is likely, therefore, that a combination of the two approaches will offer the best strategy. structural information may also be valuable for eliminating false positives and negatives produced by fire. furthermore, all components of the fire output: normalized scores, plots, alignments and histograms should be evaluated in their biological context. further experimentation and subsequent refinements to the fire algorithm will lead to improvements in method sensitivity and specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
fire provides proof of concept that it is possible to align sequences and infer domain function by using evolutionary rates. it complements the arsenal of available computational methods and represents a new approach to sequence analyses with a wide range of potential applications in molecular biology.
