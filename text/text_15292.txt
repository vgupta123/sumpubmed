BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is recognized as one of the major infective agents in the pig industry worldwide since its appearance in the 1980s. it was first diagnosed in the usa in  <dig>  <cit> , immediately found in europe, soon disseminated to the rest of the world  <cit> . the disease is characterized by reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory distress particularly in suckling piglets, thereupon getting its name. prrsv is a single-stranded positive rna virus and a member of the family arteriviridae in the order of nidovirales  <cit> . based on phylogenetic analyses of different virus isolates around the world, prrsv can be differentiated into two genotypes: type i, represented by the european prototype lelystad strain lv, and type ii, the prototype being the northern american atcc strain vr <dig>  chinese isolates were assigned as members of the genotype ii  <cit> . extensive molecular studies show that prrsv is highly variable in antigenicity, virulence and sequence diversity  <cit> .

prrsv is a small, enveloped, single positive-stranded rna virus including a genome of about  <dig> kb, encoding nine orfs  <cit> . the prrsv genome is comprised of two polymerase genes, orf1a and 1b, and seven structural genes, orf2a, 2b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . orf1a and orf1b constitutes approximately 75% of the viral genome, and are characterized by a process of ribosomal frame shifting translated into a large polyprotein; which by self-cleavage gives rise to the non-structural proteins  including the rna-dependent rna polymerase  <cit> . open reading frames 2a,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all encode glycosylated proteins, designated gp2a, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the newly defined orf2b encodes the smallest protein of the virus particle designated gp2b  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes the non-glycosylated nucleocapsid protein , constituting 20-40% of the protein content of the virion  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes the likewise non-glycosylated matrix protein   <cit> . heterodimers constituted by gp <dig> and m have been found in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells  <cit> , and have been suggested to be involved in virus-host cell receptor interaction  <cit> . a rapid genetic divergence of prrsv was revealed by an experiment of serial in vivo passage of a prrsv strain  <cit>  and by an analysis of naturally infected pigs. the presence of genetically divergent viruses in a swine population may complicate the disease control by vaccination, because the prrsv vaccine efficacy is reduced when the challenge virus is a virus of a different genotype  <cit>  or of a different phylogenetic cluster within the same genotype  <cit> .

in china the first outbreak of prrs was recorded in  <dig> which encountered almost all provinces . due to its economic impact in china, the disease has been recognized as one of the most severe viral diseases for pig farms. the first chinese strain of prrsv was isolated in  <dig>  and the complete genome sequence of the chinese prrsv isolate bj- <dig> was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . highly pathogenic prrsv is the causative agent of porcine high fever syndrome and characterized by high fever and high death rates in pigs of all ages. since may  <dig>  the highly pathogenic prrsv has emerged in china. recently, the genomic characteristics of two other chinese isolates of prrsv were described with comparisons to some american and european isolates  <cit> . it has been documented that prrsv strains differ in virulence  <cit>  and vary genetically  <cit> . concerns that vaccine strains or derivatives of the vaccine strains may induce disease continue to be discussed  <cit> . the objective of this research was to compare the genetic and molecular characteristics of seven chinese prrsv field isolates to that of a known high-virulence prrsv isolate , the ingelvac prrs mlv vaccine, and the parent strain of the vaccine . the results inferred from this study might be useful for infection tracking as well as for vaccines development.

RESULTS
for a long time, outbreaks of highly pathogenic  prrs in many chinese territories have been attributed to the highly virulent chinese-type prrsv  strains. from january to july  <dig>   <dig> morbid pigs died among  <dig>  infected pigs according to the administrative files  <cit> . new types of prrsv variants with high pathogenicity were identified in china was responsible for severe impact on pig industry as well as food safety  <cit> . concurrently, this chinese variant of prrsv was detected in vietnam where it caused a serious epidemic  <cit> .

in this study, ls- <dig>  hm- <dig>  hq- <dig>  gch- <dig>  gc- <dig>  hq- <dig> and st- <dig> strains were isolated from hebei province. homology search and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the sequences of seven isolates belong to the american  genotype . two subgroups were classified based on orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig> and nsp <dig> genes of chinese american genotype isolates, and named as subgroup am-i and am-ii . these seven isolates clustered to the subgroup am-i for orf2- <dig> and nsp <dig>  whereas the chinese isolates bj- <dig>  vr <dig> and mlv were affiliated with subgroup am-ii based on orf2- <dig> and nsp <dig>  mlv joined the seven isolates into the subgroup  based on orf <dig> genes and show a higher evolutionary divergence  at the nucleotide acid level . the results have indicated that all seven chinese virus isolates formed a subgroup in the north american genotype, but the bj- <dig> isolate was assigned to another subgroup closely related to the vaccine strain respprrs/repro, suggesting that these strains may not be evolved from a revertant of the vaccine virus.

the glycoprotein  <dig>  is a minor component of the prrsv envelope  <cit>  with  <dig> b-cell linear epitopes, whose reactive peptides comprise regions at amino acid positions 41- <dig> and 121- <dig> within the orf <dig> sequence  <cit> . in the present study, those seven chinese isolates have a lower evolutionary divergence  with vr- <dig>  and  with mlv and bj- <dig> for orf <dig> . in comparison to vr <dig> and mlv, two aa mutations were found at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>   and have influenced the hydrophobicity of the reactive peptides 41- <dig> . however, another mutation at aa position  <dig>  did not affect the hydrophobicity of the reactive peptides 121- <dig> . in addition, other aa mutations such as positions  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  affect obviously the hydrophobicity of gp <dig> protein, which might alter the antigenic activity of gp <dig> .

the highly glycosylated orf3-encoded protein is the second most variable prrsv protein  <cit> , showing approximately an evolutionary divergence of  <dig> - <dig>  with vr- <dig>  mlv and bj- <dig> . marcelo et al  reported that  <dig> overlapping consecutive peptides  were strongly immunoreactive with 85-100% of the tested sera. those peptides were predicted to be located in the most hydrophilic region within the orf <dig> sequence. marcelo et al suggested that this region might be considered as an important immuno-dominant domain of the gp <dig> of north american strains of prrsv  <cit> . in this study, eight aa mutations were detected at position  <dig> to  <dig> within four overlapping consecutive peptides . additionally, two novel epitopes located at 73-87aa  and 66-81aa  were identified in the gp <dig> of chinese isolate  of prrsv  <cit> . these authors found that the minimum amino acid sequence requirements for epitope binding were 74-85aa  and 67-74aa  using mutation deletion analysis. especially these mutations at aa positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> affect obviously the hydrophobicity of gp <dig> protein comparing to vr <dig> and mlv . furthermore, antigenic index analysis was predicted to observe the changes of antigenic characterization by dnastar program . the changes of the antigenic index were found to be at aa positions 60- <dig> . additional substitutions were observed at aa positions  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and 205- <dig>  where aa mutations at these regions occurred correspondingly . however, further investigations are needed to determine the effects of such mutations on the host-virus interaction.

the glycoprotein  <dig>  is also a minor component of the prrsv envelope  <cit>  and a typical class i membrane protein  <cit> . sequences of orf4derived from the tested seven isolates showed an evolutionary divergence of  <dig> - <dig>  with vr <dig>  mlv and  <dig> - <dig>  with bj- <dig> . previous study revealed that the gp <dig> protein of a north american strain of prrsv contained one immunodominant domain, comprising amino acid residues 51- <dig>  <cit> . in our study, those mutations at aa positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> obviously affect the hydrophobicity of gp <dig> protein compared to vr <dig> and mlv . the core of a neutralization domain of the glycoprotein encoded by orf <dig> of lelystad virus and recognized by mabs consists of amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and is located at the most variable region of the protein  <cit> . the two mutations of positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  exactly located within this region and may affect the antigenicity of chinese isolates in the present study. antigenic index analysis revealed that seven antigenic changes for virus isolate ls- <dig>  gch- <dig>  hm- <dig>  hq- <dig>  hq- <dig> and st- <dig> and five antigenic changes for virus isolate gc- <dig> were observed . however, further studies are necessary to demonstrate whether the putative linear epitope identified in the present study is recognized by neutralizing antibodies.

glycoprotein  <dig>  is one of the major structural proteins encoded by prrsv and forms disulfide-linked heterodimers with m protein in the viral envelope  <cit> . the orf <dig> of prrsv encodes a  <dig> - <dig> kda envelope protein with a characteristic hydropathy profile and putative glycosylation sites  <cit> . amplicons of orf <dig> genes derived from the  <dig> tested isolates had the same size of  <dig> bp . the sequence alignments indicated that they had an identity of 99-100% at the nucleotide level and 98-100% at the amino acid level between mlv and bj- <dig>  however, the deduced amino acid sequence comparison indicated that those isolates show an higher evolutionary divergence of  <dig> - <dig>  with vr- <dig> and mlv, <dig> - <dig>  with bj- <dig> , and displayed considerable genetic variation.

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  glycoprotein  <dig>  is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein and a major inducer of neutralizing antibodies in vivo, containing three putative n-linked glycosylation sites , where a major neutralization epitope  <cit>  is located. plagemann et al.  <cit>  also used peptide mapping to show that the major neutralization epitope of prrsv is located to the middle of the gp <dig> ectodomain . this neutralization epitope is flanked by multiple n-linked glycosylation sites, which are probably important for correct folding, targeting, and biological activity of the protein. the loss of these n-linked glycosylation sites enhances both the sensitivity of these viruses to in vitro neutralization and the immunogenicity of the nearby neutralization epitope. in this study, only gp <dig> proteins of isolate ls- <dig> and hq- <dig> had these three n-linked glycosylation sites, while other five isolates  had two n-linked glycosylation sites  because of mutation of n <dig> glycosylation site . it has been demonstrated that the retention of n <dig> was very crucial for infection of prrsv  <cit> . however, the biological characterization of those n <dig> deletion isolates should be further analyzed in future work. these results have indicated the sensitivity of most chinese virus isolates to neutralization by prrsv-specific antibodies after vaccination. in another study, a neutralizing epitope in the ectodomain of gp <dig> has been previously described  <cit> . the core sequence of this neutralizing epitope  was present in gp <dig> proteins of isolates ls- <dig> and hq- <dig>  while other isolates had only shown a mutant epitope  . it is suggested that mutation variants of n <dig> glycosylation site loss have great significance for development of prrsv vaccines of enhanced protective efficacy. three minimal epitopes  were precisely defined in the c terminus of gp <dig> protein and were highly conserved among the north american type isolates  <cit> . the sequence "qwgrl" might be a characteristic of highly pathogenic prrsv, while corresponding aa position of low pathogenic prrsv show "rwgrl"  <cit> . a mutation  of st- <dig> isolate was identical to mlv and bj- <dig>  while other six isolates were the same with vr <dig>  hub <dig>  ch-1a and hun <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of nsp <dig> gene obtained during this study and those of isolates vr <dig>  and mlv strains retrieved from genbank, indicated that all the seven nsp <dig> sequences belonged to the north american genotype. comparison between seven chinese isolates and both vr- <dig> mlv and bj- <dig> showed  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  nucleotide identity , respectively. remarkably, compared to the vr- <dig> and mlv strain, analysis of the partial nsp <dig> sequences revealed that a 30-aa deletion of a fragment containing a major hydrophilic region had occurred from residues  <dig> to  <dig> , which was also previously reported  <cit> . some evidences have pointed to the conclusion that the highly pathogenic prrsv with the 30-aa deletion in nsp <dig> is the causative agent of atypical prrs in china  <cit> . on the contrary, another research has reported that the 30-amino-acid deletion in the nsp <dig> of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus emerging in china is not related to its virulence  <cit> .

the nsp <dig> protein has been shown to be highly variable among arteriviruses, with similarities observed only in the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains whereas the central region of the protein varies in both length and amino acid composition  <cit> . interestingly, the nsp <dig> protein was found to contain the highest frequency of immunogenic epitopes including positions 27- <dig>  37- <dig>  483- <dig>  503- <dig> - <dig> and 833- <dig>  when compared to reference virus strains examined in this study . in addition, these immuno-dominant b-cell epitopes were scattered along the protein sequence, and most of them were localized within predicted hydrophilic regions of the protein by predicting hydropathy kyte-doolittle method . these results were not unexpected since hydrophilic amino acid sequences are likely to be exposed on the surface of the protein and thus may be more easily recognized by b-lymphocytes. a previous report has also demonstrated the occurrence of a cluster of b-cell epitopes in nsp <dig> of an eutype prrsv isolate and a north america prrsv isolate, nvsl 97- <dig> strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study presented detailed molecular and phylogenetic analyses for seven field isolates of prrsv from china. the collected results revealed that the highly pathogenic prrsv variants with the 30-aa deletion in nsp <dig> were still the dominating viruses in china. the genetic diversity of prrsv strain existed in the field in china. these results might be useful for the origin and genetic diversity of prrsv chinese isolates and the development of vaccine candidates in the future.
