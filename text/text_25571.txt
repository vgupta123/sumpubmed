BACKGROUND
green algae originated as much as  <dig> million years ago, evolving shortly after the endosymbiotic event that gave rise to early photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> . during the evolutionary history of earth, green algae have become major players in global energy/biomass production and biogeochemical recycling  <cit> . the green algal genus ulva linnaeus , which includes the genus formerly known as enteromorpha <cit> , is a cosmopolitan intertidal macroalga and includes more than  <dig> species  <cit> . it is well known for its distribution in all aquatic habitats including freshwater, brackish environments, marine and fully saline environments throughout the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world  <cit> . this group also possesses features that provide them with a competitive edge for rapid and successful colonization in eutrophic conditions, namely a copious production of reproductive spore bodies; the ability to rapidly take up and store high amounts of inorganic nitrogen; and a wide tolerance to adverse environmental conditions such as temperature, light intensity, salinity, and anoxia  <cit> . in addition, when these algae grow under eutrophic conditions, they have the competitive advantage of rapid and successful colonization, resulting in a “green tide”  <cit> , which has the following deleterious ecological effects: the uncoupling of biogeochemical cycles in sediments from those in the water column  <cit> , a negative effect on seagrass beds due to shading, disruption of feeding by wading birds  <cit> , the development of a lethal environment due to oxygen deficiency  <cit>  and a shift from a high diversity mixture to low-diversity assemblages of fast growing annuals  <cit> . because of their ecological effects, green tides have drawn considerable attention from scientists and governments  <cit> .

whole genome or transcriptome sequencing could elucidate the genetic basis for this physiological characteristic or exploit this group’s unique genetic resources based on global gene expression  <cit> . over the last few years, the application of newly developed high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed hundreds of thousands of high-quality sequence reads to be produced de novo from whole genome or transcriptome templates, thus enabling immediate inroads to genetic studies of organisms for which little or no sequence data exist  <cit> . for non-model organisms, sequencing and assembling of genomes remains challenging and costly, even when considering high throughput sequencing technology  <cit> . as an alternative, sequencing transcriptomes is less complex and provides fast and cost-effective access to the gene expression profile of an organism  <cit> . transcriptomes present a valuable resource for accelerating gene discovery by expanding gene families  <cit> , improving genome annotation  <cit> , elucidating phylogenetic relationships  <cit> , facilitating breeding programs for both plants and animals by providing ssr and snp markers  <cit> , and allowing large-scale expression analysis  <cit>  and rapid identification of transcripts involved in specific biological processes  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated the success of  <dig> de novo sequencing, assembly and analysis of transcriptomes in non-model organisms with no prior genomic resources  <cit> . the generation of such large-scale sequence data will enable functional analyses that were previously limited to model organisms and their rapid application in ecologically important taxa  <cit> .

to date, genomic information about algae is still limited compared to land plants. moreover, algae are generally far more diverse and evolutionarily divergent than land plants  <cit> . currently, nearly complete genomic information is available publicly for only five green microalgae species: chlamydomonas reinhardtti   <cit> , chlorella variabilis   <cit> , ostreococcus tauri   <cit> , micromonas   <cit>  and volvox carteri   <cit> . to date, there is little genomic data available for the ulvophyceae, a group that is diverse and evolutionarily divergent from all of the currently sequenced genomes of green microalgae. for the ulvophyceae group, est resources have been developed using sanger sequencing in three species, acetabularia acetabulum <cit> , ulva linza <cit>  and ulva prolifera <cit> . a comprehensive description of the full complement of genes as a transcriptome, however, is still unavailable. ulva linza is one of the species found in the mid to low intertidal on bedrock, and it is also a major contributor to biofouling  <cit> . it must cope with more dramatic changes than land plants because of tidal changes in light intensity, temperature, salinity, and wave action and with the biotic stresses characteristic of dense coastal ecosystems. in this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of u. linza under a wide variety of environmental stress conditions with the aim of uncovering some of potential genomic mechanisms that might explain its ability to rapidly and successfully colonize the coastal ecosystems and form green tides.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and de novo assembly of the transcriptome
the normalized cdna library of u. linza cells grown under the normal and six stress conditions was constructed using smart technology. the library was subjected to a one-half plate run with the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform, and the transcriptome was assembled from the resulting sequencing reads. sequencing of the cdna library generated a total  <dig>  raw reads , with an average sequence length of  <dig> bases . after trimming the adapter sequences and removing the short sequences with low complexity and low quality scores,  <dig>  high quality reads were obtained, corresponding to  <dig> % of the original raw sequences. a total of  <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  contiguous sequences , accounting for  <dig> % of the assembled reads, while  <dig>  reads remained as singletons . the size of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bases, with an average length of  <dig>  bases. as expected for a randomly fragmented transcriptome, there was a positive relationship between the length of a given contig and the number of reads assembled into that contig. the length distribution and read depth of the contigs are shown in figure  <dig>  revealing that more than  <dig>  contigs are greater than  <dig> bp, with an average depth of coverage of  <dig>  sequences per nucleotide position. contiguous sequences were further assembled into  <dig>  isotigs, which are the putative transcripts constructed using the overlapping contig reads provided as input to the newbler cdna assembler. the average length of the isotigs was  <dig>  bases, with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bases . the coverage depth for isotigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  contigs assembled into each isotig. when compared to the transcriptomes of green algae and land plants including c. reinhardtii, v. carteri, p. patens and a. thaliana, we found that a total of  <dig>   common genes could be identified in the transcriptome of u. linza.


comparison to other proteomes of green algae
to identify novel features of the u. linza transcriptome, a blastx search was used to compare the isotigs to sequences from other organisms belonging to the green algae lineage. in this analysis we included four fully sequenced organisms that diverged at different times during evolution: c. reinhardtii, a model organism for photosynthetic unicellular eukaryotes  <cit> ; o. tauri, which is the smallest free-living eukaryote identified to date and one of the most ancient clade among chlorophyta with the features of genome compaction and gene family downsizing  <cit> ; c. variabilis, which is used as a model system for studying algal symbioses and algal–viral interactions of freshwater organisms  <cit> ; and micromonas which offers valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the dynamic nature of early plant evolution  <cit> . sequence comparisons revealed that genes shared between u. linza and the four unicellular green microalgae have a consistent frequency and similarity . in contrast, the frequency of unique sequences when compared with different green algal species was clearly different, ranging from about  <dig> in c. reinhardtii to  <dig>  in o. tauri. the  <dig>  reads, which have no counterpart in o. tauri but do in c. reinhardtii, were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs. totally  <dig> isotigs could be annotated, among which at least  <dig> sequences were also conserved in volvox, micromonas and chlorella . this indicates that o. tauri lost genes compared to other green algae.


in total,  <dig>  isotigs in u. linza were found to be conserved in all four of the green algae, thus they might have existed before the species diverged and may therefore play basic roles for their survival . the lineage-specific genes have evolved after the species diverged by gene transfer or gene loss, and may contribute to their specific characteristics and adaptation to their living environments. the analysis also provides us with  <dig>  isotigs that are exclusive to u. linza, not found in the other four green algal genomes queried. this corresponds to  <dig> % of the total isotig repertoire in u. linza, which is similar to the fraction of unique genes found in nannochloropis gaditana   <cit>  and c. reinhardtii , but is much higher than that of c. variabilis nc64a , micromonas sp. rcc <dig>  and o. tauri . among the  <dig>  specific isotigs in u. linza, only  <dig> could be annotated and  <dig> of which were conserved in land plants including disease resistance proteins, an abc transporter, etc. . u. linza lives in intertidal zone of coastal ecosystems, which is a transitional environment from sea water to land, and is therefore exposed to direct sunshine several hours per day. moreover, the sessile form of life of u. linza cannot escape from stress conditions by swimming deeper, a behavior that is typical of planktonic algae  <cit> . we predicted that these land-specific genes in u. linza may be related to the colonization of the special coastal ecosystems.


functional annotation
all sequences were aligned against the local non-redundant  protein database downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information  using the blastx algorithm. when the e-value cutoff was set at 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  reads  had significant blast matches. according to the scores obtained by the blastx, the high quality reads were assigned to the taxonomic tree that was representative of bacteria  and eukaryota . as expected, the taxonomic assignment was well represented by chlorophyta  and embryophyta  within the viridiplantae group. within chlorophyta, the top four assignments were assigned to chlorella, ulva, volvox and chlamydomonas.

the isotigs were further annotated with go terms based on their sequence similarities to known proteins in the uniprot database annotated with go terms as well as the interpro and pfam domains they contain. a total of  <dig>  isotigs  were functionally annotated with  <dig>  go terms. among these,  <dig>  were assigned at least one go term in the biological process category,  <dig>  in the molecular function category and  <dig>  in the cellular component category . in the biological process class , the majority of the go terms were grouped into cellular  and metabolic  processes. however, in the category of molecular function, the vast majority of go terms were classified into binding  and catalytic activities . under the category of cellular components, 32% of all go terms corresponded to cell parts and organelles.


the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthology  is a classification system that provides an alternative functional annotation of genes based on their associated biological pathways . to reconstruct the metabolic pathways involved in u. linza, both reads and isotigs were assigned to the kegg. in total  <dig>  reads and  <dig>  isotigs having enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the highest numbers of reads were assigned to pathways on the second level of energy metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , and immune systems  and on the third level of carbon fixation , abc transporters  and photosynthesis . in contrast, the highest numbers of isotigs were assigned to pathways on the second level of carbohydrate metabolism , translation , and amino acid metabolism  and on the third level of ribosome , spliceosome , and purine metabolism  . the reason for the difference between reads and isotigs was that only a fraction of reads could be assembled into isotigs, and those unassembled reads may also have functional implications. read-based kegg annotation also can be used to estimate the expression abundance of certain kegg functions. pathways that possessed the highest number of isotigs were similar to those in c. reinhardtii, v. carteri and p. patens, but different from arabidopsis thaliana on the third level.


photoprotection mechanisms in u. linza
in taxa of photosynthetic eukaryotes, the thylakoid membrane-integral light-harvesting complex  antenna systems, especially lhcii in photosystem ii, play important roles in regulating energy flow to reaction centers  <cit> . the lhc systems are generally used to harvest and transfer excitation energy into the reaction centers to drive photosynthesis. however, under excess light conditions, they undergo a conformational change and activate a quenching state for energy dissipation, termed non-photochemical quenching   <cit> .

the light-harvesting antenna complex in psii consists of two types of proteins: major trimer-forming lhcii antenna proteins and minor lhcii proteins. in land plants, major lhcii proteins are encoded by multiple lhcb <dig>  lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> genes  <cit> , but in green algae, the major lhcii proteins encoded by lhcbm genes showed great diversity  <cit> . nineteen lhcbm-encoding genes have been found in the transcripome of u. linza, and of these, the five genes that had full-length sequences were selected for phylogenetic tree construction. the phylogenetic tree shows that the major lhcii genes have undergone significant divergence in different organisms; this may be an adaptation mechanism to optimize light-harvesting capacity and acclimation to environmental conditions. three minor psii antenna have been found in land plants, namely cp <dig> , cp <dig> , and cp <dig> ; all of these are located at the interface between the major lhcii proteins and psii  <cit> . the minor proteins cp <dig> and cp <dig> have been shown to play direct roles in npq in land plants  <cit> . the cp <dig> protein evolved differently and more recently in land plants as it is absent in all green algae  <cit> . in u. linza, only the cp <dig> and cp <dig> proteins were found as expected. from the phylogenetic tree, it can be seen that cp <dig> and cp <dig> are found in all green plant groups examined and evolved distinctly to the major lhcii proteins, which were present prior to diversification of the major lineages . the conserved nature and distribution of the minor lhcii proteins suggests that they have a significant function.

we also found the co-expressed lhcsr and psbs genes, which are photoprotection-related lhc genes. the psbs protein was recently implicated in npq in land plants  <cit> . psbs was not the site of quenching itself; instead it acts as a ph-dependent trigger to activate the quenching sites by regulating the organization of lhcii antenna system with the psii core complex  <cit> . however, in green algae, such as chlamydomonas, no accumulation of the psbs protein could be detected, although the genes are structurally similar to psbs  <cit> . the lack of the psbs and cp <dig> proteins in green algae implied that the mechanistic basis of npq in these groups is likely different. in fact, the stress-related lhc member lhcsr proteins in green algae have been shown to participate in npq, likely indicating an early photoprotective mechanism  <cit> . furthermore, the lhcsr <dig> protein in chlamydomonas appears to merge both ph-sensing and energy-quenching functions in plants, which are accomplished by psbs and monomeric lhcb proteins, respectively  <cit> . among the land plants, the mechanism of npq was unique in the moss, p. patens, where both the lhcsr and psbs proteins are active  <cit> . the mechanism for npq was hypothesized to have evolved from being lhcsr-based to being psbs-based during the transition to land colonization  <cit> . however, the transcription profiles of both lhcsr and psbs genes in u. linza indicate that the psbs-based npq mechanism emerged before the land colonization. in addition, we found that both the psbs and lhcsr genes were induced by high light  and the expression patterns of these two genes were consistent , which indicates that both psbs and lhcsr are active in photoprotection of u. linza. this result also suggests that the photoprotective mechanism in ulva may differ from that of unicellular green algae. a potential explanation for this difference is that ulva must cope with dramatic changes in the intensity and spectral quality of light in rocky coastal ecosystems. u. linza is a photophilous alga commonly distributed in shallow and horizontal habitats, like sun-exposed rocky shores. the light irradiance varies more dramatically for the algae than for land plants because of the morning and evening tides.


carbon fixation pathway
besides photoprotection mechanisms, efficient carbon fixation is essential for photosynthesis, and as such likely to facilitate the colonization of coastal ecosystems and the accumulation of high u. linza biomass. aquatic photosynthetic organisms are exposed to dramatic changes in the supply of dissolved inorganic carbon . to acclimate to the ci-limiting environmental conditions, they have developed a carbon concentrating mechanisms  to optimize the photosynthesis rate under the co2-limiting condition  <cit> . at least one α-carbonic anhydrase  with targeting signals for the chloroplast lumen was found in u. linza. lumenal-targeted αcas are well known from c. reinhardtii and higher plants and are essential for growth under ambient co <dig> concentrations  <cit> . thus, we predicted that the α-ca-based ccm type found in u. linza would show a strong similarity to the ccm in c. reinhardtii <cit> . few genes common to organisms that actively or passively enhance ci influx in ccms were found in u. linza. only a putative soluble protein, lcib, was identified as a candidate for a chloroplast ci transporter, and no ci membrane transporter candidate was found. five low/limited co2-induced proteins were identified, including two regulatory factors  that control the expression of the co2-related genes.

c4-photosynthesis is an important feature in some higher plants in tropical environments, as it helps them cope well with high light intensities, high temperatures, and dryness  <cit> . some intermediate products of the c <dig> carbon-fixation pathway have been detected in diatoms, brown algae, green algae and red algae  <cit> . the c4-like ccm mechanism in green algae of o. tauri <cit>  and micromonas <cit>  may provide them an ecological advantage in the co2-limiting conditions of phytoplankton blooms. in ulva prolifera, coexistence of c <dig> and c4-like pathway may contribute to its wide distribution and forming blooms  <cit> . in u. linza, genes encoding all of the enzymes required for c <dig> photosynthesis were identified implying a putative c4-like ccm mechanism .

transporters
transporters are mainly responsible for the acquisition, redistribution and compartmentalization of organic nutrients and inorganic ions, as well as for the efflux of toxic compounds and metabolic end products. a total of  <dig> transport members were found in the u. linza transcriptome, and the complement resembles that of both green algae and land plants. the atp-binding cassette  family  and the p-type adenosine triphosphatase  family  are large compared to other transporters. one homologue of a plant-specific peroxisomal abc transporter was found in ulva, but is absent in the genomes of other green algae. ulva is known for its ability to take up inorganic nutrients and use them to grow rapidly, which allows it to be successful in nitrogen-rich areas and form the green tides  <cit> . the transcriptome encodes at least  <dig> transporters for essential inorganic nutrients . u. linza obtains nitrogen in at least three different ways, and ammonium is the best nitrogen source for ulva growth, followed by urea and nitrate  <cit> . the complete set of genes allowing transport and assimilation of these substrates include six ammonium transporters, three high-affinity nitrate transporters, and two urea transporters. the high number of ammonium transporters indicates that ulva is a strong competitor for this resource, which is very efficiently pumped from surrounding seawater and is probably the privileged nitrogen source for ulva. the inorganic nutrient transporters found in ulva showed multiple origins. the unicellular green algae o. tauri has two prokaryote-like ammonium transporters, and one was found in u. linza . all of the three phosphate transporters found in u. linza are absent in higher land plants, two occur only in green algae, and the third one is present in moss . these results suggest that the phosphate transporting mechanism in ulva may be old and associated with aquatic environments and that it was lost during adaptation to land. of the three sulfate transporters, two are in the na+/so42--family; neither of these is present in higher land plants but one is present in moss. the third one is conserved in both green algae and high plants .

cytochrome p <dig> oxidoreductases
eukaryotic cytochrome p450s are oxidoreductases, most of which catalyze nadph- and o2-dependent hydroxylation reactions  <cit> . plant p450s participate in a myriad of biochemical pathways, including those devoted to the synthesis of plant products and plant growth regulators  <cit> . the complexity of the p <dig> family is reflected in the evolution of the metabolic complexity of organisms. u. linza has at least  <dig> cytochrome p450s, which is a higher number than that found in other algae  and brown alga ectocarpus ), but a lower number than that found in land plants  and arabidopsis ). nearly half of the p450s in u. linza are conserved in algae  . these p450s likely originated in algae and may be related to acclimatization to the aquatic environment. the role of these conserved p450s is poorly understood. a few of members of the cyp <dig> family are known to be involved in accumulating secondary ketocarotenoids in response to stress in terrestrial plants  <cit> . some p450s genes in u. linza are homologous to those in fungus, land plants, and even animals but are absent in unicellular green algae. we predicted that these genes may function in allelopathy in u. linza, thus allowing it to produce toxic substances for defense against herbivory or other phototrophic organisms that compete for light and nutrients  <cit> . u. linza is known to exhibit strong allelopathy: as one of the most common green tide macroalgal species, it has to outcompete other coastal primary producers and establish dominant populations in a short time  <cit> .

stress-related proteins
glutamate dehydrogenase  catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia. in plants, the enzyme can work in either direction depending on environment and stress  <cit> . it links the two fundamental metabolic processes involving carbon and nitrogen within a cell, and transgenic plants expressing microbial gdhs exhibit improved tolerance to herbicides, water deficits, and pathogen infections  <cit> . two gdh genes were found in arabidopsis, and only one was found in chlamydomonas. in contrast, eight putative gdh genes were found in u. linza. seven of these gdh genes have similarities to those found in bacteria, fungus, and even animals . lateral gene transfer has been shown to play a significant role in the evolution of the gdh genes  <cit> . thus, we predicted that the diverse gdh genes in ulva may have been obtained recently by gene transfer and function in maintaining a balance between carbon and nitrogen metabolites and enhancing the stress tolerance.

reactive oxygen species generated during photosynthesis are scavenged by superoxide dismutases , ascorbate peroxidase , and catalase  in plants  <cit> . four putative apx genes were found in u. linza, which is more than has been found in c. reinhardtii , v. carteri , and p. patens  but less than in a. thaliana . all four apx genes are conserved in green algae and land plants . in contrast, the two cat genes in u. linza show higher similarities to those in fungi and bacteria than to those in green algae, and they have no homologous genes in land plants . the apx and cat genes, which are involved in scavenging reactive oxygen, may have evolved in different ways. two fe-type and one mn-type sods were found in u. linza, but no cu/zn-type or ni-containing sod was found. however, a cu/zn-type sod was found to be expressed in ulva fasciata in response to copper stress  <cit> . we predicted that fe-type and mn-type sods may play dominant roles in response to broad stress conditions, such as high salt, high light, and high temperature conditions. in contrast, the cu/zn-type sod may be related only to heavy metal stresses.

heat-shock proteins  constitute a major class of stress-response proteins that mainly assist in protein refolding under stress conditions. thirty-two hsp genes were found in u. linza from four conserved families: hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and low-molecular-mass hsps . in u. linza,  <dig> shsps belong to the hsp <dig> family, and these hsp <dig> proteins show high similarities to prokaryotes as to green algae and plants . similar observations were also made in terrestrial plants, where the shsps are highly diverse, such as in arabidopsis,  <dig> different shsps are grouped into six classes  <cit> . in contrast to hsp <dig> proteins, most members of the hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> families found in u. linza were conserved well in eukaryotic algae and plants, with the exception of only three . compared to other unicellular green algae, number of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins was increased in u. linza, especially members of the hsp <dig> family . the hsp <dig> family is distinct in that most of its known substrates are signal transduction proteins, such as steroid hormone receptors and signaling kinases  <cit> , which may play a key role in signal transduction networks, protein degradation and protein trafficking. thus, the increasing number of hsp <dig> members indicates that u. linza may possess a hsp/chaperone network that is more complicated than that found in unicellular algae, and it may be related to the acclimation of u. linza to the intricate environment of the intertidal zone.

CONCLUSIONS
the green algal genus ulva linnaeus  is well known for its wide distribution in marine, freshwater, and brackish environments throughout the world. the ulva species are also highly tolerant of variations in salinity, temperature, and irradiance and are the main cause of green tides, which can have deleterious ecological effects. however, only limited genomic information is currently available in this non-model and ecologically important species. the transcriptome of u. linza uncovers some of potential genomic mechanisms that might explain its ability to rapidly and successfully colonize the coastal ecosystems, including the specific photoprotective mechanism based on both lhcsr and psbs; development of c4-like carbon-concentrating mechanisms; muti-origin transporters for essential inorganic nutrients; multiple and complex p450s, glutamate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and heat-shock proteins that are related to stress resistance.
