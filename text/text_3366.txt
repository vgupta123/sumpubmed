BACKGROUND
s-adenosyl-l-methionine  is an important metabolite in plants as it not only provides the methyl group required for sam-dependent biomethylation reactions, but also acts as the precursor for the biosynthesis of polyamines, nicotianamine, phytosiderophores, and the plant hormone ethylene  <cit> . sam is metabolized to s-adenosylhomocysteine  in biological methylation, and to 5'-methylthioadenosine  in many other essential biological processes. while sah is the product and a potent inhibitor of all sam-dependent methyltransferases  <cit> , mta inhibits spermine synthase  <cit>  in polyamine biosynthesis, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase  <cit>  in ethylene biosynthesis. both polyamine and ethylene are important in plant development, growth, stress response and survival  <cit> . to promptly remove the toxic by-product mta and to ensure sufficient supply of methionine and sam, a methionine salvage pathway that recycles the methylthio moiety of mta to methionine has evolved in almost all organisms. in plants, this pathway is also known as the yang cycle  <cit> . in this cycle mta is first depurinated to 5-methylthioribose , and then phosphorylated to form mtr 1-phosphate . mtr 1-p then undergoes isomerization, dehydration, enolization and dephosphorylation to form the acireductone,  <dig> -dihydroxyl-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene. this acireductone is subsequently converted to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate and then transaminated to methionine  <cit> .

metabolic variation in how mta is recycled to methionine exists between different species. in bacteria and plant cells, two enzymes, mta nucleosidase and mtr kinase, are required to convert mta to mtr-1-p while in mammalian cells, mta phosphorylase  <cit>  phosphorylizes mta to mtr 1-p in a single step. this metabolic difference has been explored and analogs of mta and mtr have been synthesized for the development of specific antibiotics and herbicides  <cit> . mtr kinase is not an essential enzyme for the organisms' survival if methionine is present in the growth medium  <cit> , but in the absence of methionine, expression of mtr kinase will prompt an organism to uptake mta and/or mtr from the environment to replenish its sulfur pool  <cit> . interestingly, even when sulfur is not depleted in the environment, numerous analogs of mtr have demonstrated selective growth inhibition of mtr kinase-containing bacteria  <cit> . not surprisingly, the bactericidal activity of these mtr analogs, particularly trifluoromethylthioribose, is enhanced if the de novo methionine synthesis pathway is also blocked  <cit> . in plants, the expression of mtr kinase is also up-regulated under sulfur-limiting conditions, although the expression is not correlated with ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . while most studies of mtr analogs have been performed on bacterial mtr kinases for the design of novel antibiotics, similar principles can be applied to the plant system to develop new herbicide and/or herbicide-resistant transgenic crops that would improve agriculture efficiency.

the modern rational approach to new agrochemical discovery includes structure-based design approaches  <cit> , which requires a detailed understanding of the target enzyme's structure, catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. to this end, we present the first structural analysis of a. thaliana mtr kinase in complex with adp and mtr.

RESULTS
overall fold of mtr kinase
the structure of arabidopsis thaliana mtr kinase has two lobes: a smaller n-lobe and a larger c-lobe connected by a linker region  . the n-lobe is composed of five anti-parallel β strands  flanked by three short α helices  in an ααβββαββ topology . helices α1a and α1b are located at the n-terminus, while helix α <dig> is inserted between strands β <dig> and β <dig> and lies beneath the β strands near the c-lobe . the larger c-lobe is predominantly α helical with twelve α helices  and six short  <dig> helices  along with four short β strands  between helices α <dig> and α <dig>  and a short strand, β <dig>  at the c-terminal end of the linker region. strand β <dig> forms an anti-parallel β turn with strand β <dig>  while strands β <dig> and β <dig> form a second anti-parallel sheet. the bilobal structural organization as well as the topology profile of mtr kinase is consistent with that found in eukaryotic protein kinases.

a. thaliana mtr kinase has 35% amino acid sequence identity with bacillus subtilis mtr kinase. the two enzymes share a similar secondary structure profile   <cit>  and have a cα root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å . mtr kinase is structurally similar to other evolutionarily related protein kinase-like phosphotransferases. a comparison of the structure of a. thaliana mtr kinase to other known structures using dali reveals that the enzyme resembles choline kinase   <cit> , aph type iiia -iiia)   <cit> , and the archaeal atypical serine protein kinase rio <dig>   <cit>  with z-scores of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cα rmsd's of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, and aligned sequence identities of 14%, 13% and 19%, respectively  <cit> .

quaternary structure
the structure of a. thaliana mtr kinase has two subunits in the asymmetric unit related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold . approximately  <dig> Å <dig> or  <dig> % of the surface area of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface  <cit> . even though the plant enzyme underwent a complex multi-step refolding process  <cit> , its dimeric structure resembles that of the bacterial enzyme  <cit> . size exclusion chromatography of a. thaliana mtr kinase , the physical characterization of other plant mtr kinases  <cit>  as well as the apparent cooperative kinetics observed for the rice enzyme  <cit>  all suggest that mtr kinase functions as a homodimer. the inter-subunit interactions in the dimer interface of a. thaliana mtr kinase are predominantly symmetrical and are concentrated at the c-terminus of helix α <dig> . additional inter-subunit interactions are found at the n-terminus of helix α <dig> , the c-terminus of helix α <dig> , as well as the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig>  . the interactions between these residues are depicted in fig. 2c. interestingly, when comparing the dimeric interfaces of the b. subtilis and a. thaliana enzymes, the identities of the residues involved in dimerization are not conserved . the interactions are nevertheless concentrated in approximately the same region of the protein, especially the c-terminal end of helix α <dig>  and result in exactly the same dimeric structure.

although the tertiary structures of mtr kinase and other protein kinase-like phosphotransferases are highly similar, their quaternary structures are distinct. while mtr kinase dimerizes mainly via interactions between helices α <dig>  choline kinase dimerizes via interactions between helices that are structurally equivalent to helices α <dig> of mtr kinase. although crystal structures of aph show the protein as dimers  <cit> , they are not physiologically relevant as the enzyme is observed as a monomer in solution  <cit> . rio <dig> protein kinase is also observed as a monomer  <cit> .

nucleotide binding site
the nucleotide binds in the cleft region between the two lobes of the protein. the adenine ring of the nucleotide binds near the linker region in a hydrophobic pocket. the n <dig> and n <dig> nitrogens of the adenine ring are hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of r <dig> and the amide nitrogen of l <dig>  respectively . the strictly conserved k <dig> also interacts with the α-phosphoryl group of the nucleotide via an ionic interaction. a structurally conserved water molecule  donates two hydrogen bonds to the nucleotide: one to the n <dig> nitrogen of the adenine ring and the other to the o <dig> oxygen of the nucleotide's α-phosphoryl group . this water molecule is also observed in all of the bacterial mtr kinase nucleotide complex structures determined to date  <cit> .

functionally important loops
there are four conserved loop regions in mtr kinases: the g-loop between strands β <dig> and β <dig>  the hgd catalytic loop between strand β <dig> and the  <dig> helix η <dig>  the mg binding dxe-motif between strands β <dig> and β <dig>  and the semi-conserved w-loop between strand β <dig> and helix α <dig> . the g-loop of mtr kinases has a highly conserved gxgnxn motif  and is structurally analogous the "nucleotide positioning loop" in aph-iiia  <cit>  and the "gly triad" gxgxxg motif found in many eukaryotic protein kinases.

gly-rich loop  and solvent accessibility
in a. thaliana mtr kinase, the g-loop plays a similar role in anchoring and coordinating the bound nucleotide. residue d <dig> of the g-loop, although not absolutely conserved, makes a ~ <dig>  Å hydrogen bond to the nucleotide's o3' ribosyl oxygen, while the backbone and terminal amide nitrogen's of n <dig> interact with the β-phosphoryl oxygens. the g-loop of a. thaliana mtr kinase has an extended conformation, with interactions formed between n <dig> and the o <dig> oxygen of mtr . this extended g-loop conformation is different from that observed in the bacterial mtr kinase, as the equivalent residue in the b. subtilis enzyme, n <dig>  is over  <dig> Å away from the o <dig> oxygen of mtr . in most of the bacterial structures determined to date  <cit> , the g-loop is disordered, and in no case does it interact with mtr. a consequence of this extended g-loop in the arabidopsis enzyme is that it shields the active site from solvent , a feature that more closely resembles a eukaryotic protein kinase active site than that of the b. subtilis mtr kinase . since the g-loop appears to deny the entry and/or exit of nucleotides, conformational changes – loop movement at a minimum – will need to occur to allow nucleotide entry to the apo-form the enzyme.

dxe-motif and mg binding
in the a. thaliana mtr kinase structure, two mg ions assist in the binding of the adp. mg ions are important for mtr kinase activity. the kinase activity is optimal in the presence of mg ions, attenuated to 20% in the presence of mn ions, and abolished in the presence of ca ions  <cit> . residues d <dig> and e <dig> are part of the strictly conserved dxe-motif on the loop between strands β <dig> and β <dig> and are essential for mg binding. the first magnesium ion, mg, is chelated by the carboxyl oδ oxygens of d <dig>  the carboxyl oε oxygen of e <dig>  the o <dig> oxygen of the β-phosphoryl group of adp, and two water molecules. these water molecules in turn interact with the o <dig> oxygen of mtr and the catalytic residue d <dig>  . the second magnesium ion, mg, is chelated by the α- and β-phosphoryl oxygens of adp, the oδ oxygen of d <dig> and three water molecules. one of the water molecules that interacts with mg  also interacts with o <dig> oxygen of mtr . unlike the bacterial mtr kinase where the water molecules surrounding the mg ions have poor electron density, both mg ions in the a. thaliana adp-enzyme complex are coordinated in the most energetically favorable octahedral geometry.

examination of amino acid sequences reveals that for all mtr kinases, except those from nocardioides, streptomyces and clostridium species, the dxe-motif can be extended to a longer idxef motif . the dxe-motif is always followed by a phenylalanine, f <dig> in a. thaliana mtr kinase, which is involved in mtr binding . the significance of the dxe-motif is that this consensus sequence is analogous to the well defined dfg-motif that marks the start of the "activation loop" in protein kinases  <cit> . unlike other phosphotransferases such as aph-iiia or camp-dependent protein kinase , which use the aspartate in the dfg-motif -iiia and d <dig> in pka) and a second asparagine -iiia and n <dig> in pka) from the c-lobe to chelate the divalent metal ions, mtr kinase uses both acidic residues in the dxe-motif to bind mg.

rr-motif in the mtr binding site
the substrate mtr is located beneath the nucleotide in the active site. in a. thaliana mtr kinase, mtr is bound in the higher energy α-ribofuranose anomer with the substrate's o <dig> hydroxyl cis to the o <dig> and o <dig> hydroxyl groups . mtr is also observed in the same α-anomer in the bacterial enzyme-substrate complex  <cit>  . in the plant enzyme, the α-conformation is stabilized by interactions with d <dig> and r <dig> as well as f <dig>  which interacts with the substrates hydrophobic face . the o <dig> and o <dig> oxygens of mtr form hydrogen bonds  with the carboxyl oxygens of d <dig> of the strictly conserved hgd-motif; while the o <dig> and o <dig> oxygens of mtr forms heteronuclear hydrogen bonds  with the guanidium nitrogens of r <dig> of the strictly conserved twin arginine rr-motif . the second arginine r <dig> does not interact directly with mtr but may facilitate the release of the anionic product, mtr 1-p. in the a. thaliana enzyme, a lysine  is located near the rr-motif , and to mitigate the electrostatic repulsion between these three positively charged residues, a chloride ion is found interacting with k <dig> 

interestingly, examination of the multiple sequence alignment  shows that the residue equivalent to k <dig> in the a. thaliana enzyme, three residues upstream of the rr-motif, is always either a lysine or a glutamate residue in all known sequences of mtr kinases. most bacterial mtr kinases including the well-studied klebsiella pneumoniae and all of the bacillus enzymes, have a glutamate at this position. this glutamate will help neutralize the positive charge imposed by the rr-motif in the mtr binding site. a lysine residue near the rr-motif, as found in the plant a. thaliana, oryza sativa , vitis vinifera , and nitrogen-fixing bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum and wolinella succinogenes, would perturb mtr binding by charge repulsion when the ph falls below the pka of lysine. thus, the k <dig> in a. thaliana mtr kinase could potentially explain why this enzyme's in vitro activity is optimal at ph  <dig>  near the pka of lysine, while the optimal activity for k. pneumoniae mtr kinase occurs at ph  <dig> .

w-loop and mtr binding specificity
the w-loop between strand β <dig> and helix α <dig>  named after the semi-conserved tryptophan  at the tip of this loop, appears to modulate the size of chemical group at the 5-position that can fit into the mtr binding site. in a. thaliana mtr kinase, the 5-methylthio moiety of the mtr appears to be capped by w <dig> of the w-loop and residues v <dig> and v <dig> from the c-lobe . these three residues would appear to restrict the length of the alkylthio moiety at the 5-position. although these three residues are not strictly conserved across mtr kinase sequences, they are structurally and functionally equivalent to residues w <dig> of the w-loop, and l <dig> and l <dig> in b. subtilis mtr kinase. however, many mtr analogs with bulky extensions at the 5-position have been shown to be substrates and/or inhibitors of mtr kinase  <cit> , although the bulkiness of the substitution does not correlate with their inhibitory concentrations  <cit> . in fact, these inhibitors have comparable km values  to the native substrate in many bacterial and plant mtr kinases  <cit> . moreover, comparison between a. thaliana and b. subtilis mtr kinase shows that both the 5-methylthio moiety of mtr and the w-loop adopt different conformations in the otherwise comparable overall active sites . these results suggest that the w-loop needs to be flexible to allow the entry of different sized mtr analogs to the active site. this hypothesis is consistent with the observation in b. subtilis mtr kinase structures that the density of the w-loop is often disordered  <cit> , implying its flexibility.

conformational variations
in the structural alignment of bacterial and plant mtr kinase, the bound adp in a. thaliana is shifted toward the c-lobe when compared to the nucleotide in the b. subtilis enzyme . this observation raises the question whether the plant mtr kinase has a more closed conformation between the two-lobes than its bacterial homolog. although the overall structural alignment of the two enzymes shows no major conformation changes, a minor rigid body shift of 1– <dig>  Å in the n-lobe becomes apparent when only the c-lobes of the two structures are aligned. however, this displacement does not definitively demonstrate a potential inter-lobal movement in mtr kinase on substrate binding, because the intrinsic variation resulting from the sequence variation between the two enzymes – even neglecting the intrinsic structure coordinate errors of both structures – is more than  <dig>  Å. in other words, a  <dig>  Å displacement observed between the n-lobes is within the expected structural variation of two non-identical protein sequences  <cit> .

despite the low overall cα rmsd between the structures of a. thaliana and b. subtilis mtr kinase, the conformations of the g- and w-loop in the two enzymes differ by ~ <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å in their cα rmsds, respectively . this observation is striking as the sequence identity of the 6-residue g-loop between the two enzymes is 100%, and that of the 16-residue w loop is 50% . these rmsd values are close to the expected values if two random loops of the same length are taken from the protein data bank and structurally aligned  <cit> . the conformational variations between the two enzymes are the result of different interactions outside the loop regions. in the a. thaliana enzyme, the highly conserved e <dig>  preceding the g-loop, interacts with r <dig> of the w-loop via an ionic interaction . the corresponding e <dig> and k <dig> in the b. subtilis enzyme do not interact . moreover, in the plant enzyme, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of n <dig>  forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen of c <dig>  , but in the bacterial enzyme, the corresponding n <dig>  interacts with main chain carbonyl oxygen of v <dig>  via the side chain nδ nitrogen instead . the difference in loop conformations could also be due to the differences in how they interact with the substrate in the homologous active sites . until an apo-form of a. thaliana mtr kinase becomes available, it would be difficult to determine whether the variations in the loop conformations are substrate induced.

atpase activity in mtr kinase
the a. thaliana mtr kinase complex was prepared by co-crystallization with excess but equal amount of atpγs and mtr, but surprisingly, adp and mtr were found in the active site. thus, consistent with the soaking and co-crystallization experiments of bacterial mtrk in the presence of atp  <cit> , the plant enzyme appears to be able to hydrolyze the weakly hydrolysable atpγs to adp. without extensive kinetic characterization it is hard to know whether this atp hydrolysis is coupled to phosphorylation of mtr, because while only mtr was found in the active site, it might bind preferentially to mtr 1-p. the observation that a. thaliana mtr kinase, like its bacterial homologue, may have considerable atpase activity in the absence of the substrate mtr will have an impact on the strategies used to design herbicides that target the enzyme.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of a eukaryotic mtr kinase has been determined for the first time. although the enzyme has been refolded into its active state, it has comparable tertiary and quaternary structures to its bacterial homolog. the active site is comparable between the two enzymes with the dxe-motif coordinating the nucleotide-mg, the d <dig> of the hgd catalytic loop polarizing the mtr o <dig> oxygen, and the rr-motif interacting with mtr. the g-loop and w-loop of the a. thaliana mtr kinase adopt different conformations, a consequence potentially of differences in their microenvironments. unlike its bacterial homolog, the g-loop of a. thaliana mtr kinase has an extended conformation, which shields  most of the active site from solvent, a feature that resembles a eukaryotic protein kinase more closely than the bacterial enzyme. the a. thaliana mtr kinase has optimal activity at higher ph than its bacterial homolog and this can be explained by the presence a lysine, rather than a glutamate, near the rr-motif in mtr binding site. the structure of a. thaliana mtr kinase also provides a template for structure-based design of agrochemicals – particularly herbicides whose effectiveness could be regulated by nutrient levels. generic protein kinase inhibitors likely inhibit mtr kinase as they inhibit the remotely homologous aph enzymes  <cit> , but these kinase inhibitors are often associated with complex steps of synthesis and isolation and high cost. the strictly conserved rr-motif in mtr binding site along with the nearby catalytic aspartate offers an opportunity for a simpler organic salt of an mtr analog to specifically inhibit mtr kinase at lower cost.
