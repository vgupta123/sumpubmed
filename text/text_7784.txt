BACKGROUND
variable number tandem repeats  are increasingly widely used as molecular markers in prokaryotes. more recently, attention has turned towards examining the possible functional significance of these tandem repeats, especially that of microsatellites, which are often found outside coding regions,  <cit> . moreover, the biological significance of intragenic tandem repeats, located within coding regions, has been demonstrated for particular genes  <cit> . with the explosion of available bacterial genomic sequences it has become clear that most, if not all, bacterial genomes contain a considerable number of intragenic tandem repeats  <cit> . the finding that intragenic tandem repeats are so widespread in prokaryotes suggests that the few cases documented so far may be only the tip of the iceberg and that some of the many uncharacterized tandem repeats in bacteria possibly play functional roles in pathogenesis and/or in adaptation to environmental stresses.

here we have investigated the presence and distribution of tandemly repeated sequences in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen, legionella pneumophila, the etiological agent of legionnaires' disease. this microorganism flourishes naturally in fresh water environments, but is also frequently found in artificial water systems, which are considered the main source of legionella infections in humans  <cit> . the l. pneumophila species comprises over  <dig> serogroups, of which serogroup  <dig> is responsible for the majority of human infections. while these gram-negative bacteria can multiply free-living in culture, it is now widely accepted that intracellular replication in amoebic hosts such as acanthamoeba, naegleria, or hartmanella is essential for the propagation and dissemination of l. pneumophila  <cit> . industrial settings, altered lifestyle, and a growing number of elderly and immunocompromised individuals have led to an increase in number of reported l. pneumophila infections, which occur following inhalation of contaminated aerosols. when l. pneumophila reach the lungs, they are ingested by alveolar macrophages wherein they replicate and which they finally destroy. ultimately host cell lysis and cell death, as well as the extracellular or surface-associated action of bacterial degradative enzymes, result in damage of lung tissue. l. pneumophila infections end in an acute and severe, often fatal, pneumonia, if not quickly and correctly diagnosed.

two recent studies have examined tandem repeats in l. pneumophila as a way to discriminate between closely related strains. however, these studies have not differentiated between intergenic and intragenic repeats  <cit> . in addition, researchers studying individual virulence factors in l. pneumophila have noted the presence of repeats in these genes, and have suggested possible functional roles for the repeats  <cit> . in this study, we have identified and characterized the tandem repeat variations between  <dig> strains of l. pneumophila serogroup  <dig>  collected from a wide variety of environments and patients.

methods
origin of bacterial strains and growth conditions
lab strains  <dig> b , corby , lens , and paris , were obtained from the indicated labs and the philadelphia strain was obtained from the american tissue culture collection . strains s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were isolated via filtration and selective plating from natural water sources collected at different sites throughout belgium . strains imc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were isolated from water taps, air conditioning units, and incubators in a pediatric hospital in portugal   <cit> . the  <dig> "lea/le" strains were isolated and serotyped in our laboratory from heat or acid treated swimming water samples  collected throughout belgium . the  <dig> "l" strains were isolated from various manmade environmental water sources  in spain   <cit> . strains mgas- <dig>  mgas- <dig>  and mgas- <dig> were isolated from sputum samples of sporadic clinical infection cases in belgium . strain hrd- <dig> was isolated from a sputum samples in portugal . strains give the "bel" designation were isolated from sputum samples of clinical infections during three different outbreaks of legionella in belgium . strains ita- <dig> and ita- <dig> represent two unrelated community-acquired legionella infections from italy . the  <dig> "hl" and  <dig> "lg" strains were isolated from sporadic, epidemic, and endemic patient infections throughout france  . the  <dig> "hot springs" strains  were isolated from boreholes and hot spring runoffs in portugal and the u.s.a. with a median temperature of 42°c  <cit> .

unless otherwise described, all established l. pneumophila strains were grown at 37°c and 5% co <dig> in buffered yeast extract broth containing α-ketoglutarate  or on buffered charcoal yeast extract broth plates containing α-ketoglutarate  and supplemented with l-cysteine and ferric pyrophosphate  <cit> . all strains were stored as glycerol stocks at -80°c and thawed fresh for genomic dna isolations. for "stress" experiments, cultures of the philadelphia strain were grown on bcye-α plates  at 27°c, 37°c , 37°c  and 42°c  for three months. this work was carried out with permission of the k.u. leuven biosafety council and according to the eu directive 93/ <dig> and 90/219/ec.

genomic dna isolation
strains were grown overnight in a  <dig> ml culture of bye-α. genomic dna was isolated from  <dig> ml of this culture using a wizard® genomic dna purification kit  according to the manufacturer's recommendations. the integrity of the dna was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

pcr and sequencing
pcr primers were designed using the primer <dig> software  <cit>  and chosen based on regions of high similarity  between the published philadelphia, lens, and paris strain sequences . pcr was performed using supertaq dna polymerase  in  <dig> μl reaction volumes. initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min was followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 45°c for  <dig> s, and elongation at 72°c for  <dig> min. the final extension step was  <dig> min at 72°c. products were visualized on 1% agarose gels for initial characterization. for sequencing the repeat regions directly, a larger portion of the gene was amplified from each strain and the repeat region was sequenced by vib genetic service facility, antwerp, belgium. repeats were counted from these sequences using "tandem repeats finder" <cit> . sequence-based typing of all strains except for l430–l <dig> was performed using the seven gene method as previously described  <cit> . strains l430–l <dig> were already typed using the older six gene method  <cit> .

RESULTS
in silico screening of the legionella pneumophila genome for intragenic tandemly repeated sequences
the legionella pneumophila serogroup  <dig> philadelphia strain  <cit>  published sequence  was screened for intragenic tandem repeats using the emboss software  <cit> . this resulted in the identification of  <dig> orfs containing  <dig> tandemly repeated sequences. from this list a repeat was considered significant if it met at least one of the following three criteria: the e-tandem score was greater than  <dig>  repeat conservation was greater than 85%, or the size of the repeat was greater than  <dig> bp and was present in three or more copies. following this analysis,  <dig> tandem repeats remained, of which  <dig> were annotated in the published genome sequence only as "hypothetical protein" and discarded from analysis on the basis of the difficulty of assigning putative functions for subsequent analyses and choice as targets for future experiments. the remaining  <dig> tandem repeats were contained within  <dig> orfs and were analyzed further. these  <dig> repeats ranged in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and were found in copy numbers ranging from 3– <dig> copies . the length of every repeat was divisible by  <dig>  consistent with a strong selective pressure for repeat expansion/deletion to maintain the reading frame.

functional categorization of genes containing tandem repeats
the  <dig> genes were examined with respect to their subcellular localization using the bacterial protein localization prediction program, psortb v. <dig>   <cit> . these results were compared to the overall subcellular localization predictions of the entire l. pneumophilia philadelphia proteome . in general, the genes containing tandem repeats appear to broadly reflect the overall distribution of proteins within a cell, with the exception of a lower proportion of inner membrane proteins, and a higher proportion of periplasmic and extracellular proteins. the increase in the proportion of extracellular proteins is due to the presence of several proteins from the tetratricopeptide repeat  repeat family  and "enhanced entry protein c"  all of which contain multiple copies of a  <dig> bp repeat . this family of "eukaryotic-like" proteins is known to encode both sel- <dig>  and tpr repeat motifs within l. pneumophilia  <cit> . furthermore, these slr regions are thought to play important roles in protein-protein interactions required for virulence in legionella  <cit> , and enhc has been recently shown to be conserved in virtually every l. pneumophila species examined  <cit>  and to play a role in intracellular growth within macrophages  <cit> .

pcr characterization of repeat variability between strains
in order to determine if a particular repeat was "polymorphic" or "monomorphic", we screened a panel of  <dig> different l. pneumophilia serogroup  <dig> strains by pcr using primers designed to flank the  <dig> repeat regions described above. these strains included common lab strains, clinical isolates and environmental isolates . of the  <dig> repeats,  <dig> were found to be polymorphic . at the sequence level, the internal conservation of these polymorphic repeats was, on average, higher than that of the monomorphic repeats , as observed previously  <cit> . genes lpg <dig>  lpg <dig>  and lpg <dig> correspond to the previously characterized vntr markers lpms <dig>  lpms <dig>  and lpms <dig> respectively  <cit> . of the genes that were polymorphic, lpg <dig>  lpg <dig>  lpg <dig>  lpg <dig>  and lpg <dig> each possessed only  <dig> or  <dig> alleles whereas lpg <dig> possessed  <dig> alleles. the repeat region for gene lpg <dig> possesses  <dig> alleles and more data about lpg <dig> and its encoded protein will be described in detail elsewhere .

patterns of repeat variation
these  <dig> repeats were further examined in an additional  <dig> strains, for a total of  <dig> strains, divided into four strain groups: lab strains , environmental strains , clinical strains , and hot springs strains . however, lab strains were not considered for any subsequent statistical analyses. we next performed sequence-based typing on all  <dig> strains in order to examine the relatedness of the strains. strains were excluded if they were collected from the same site and possessed both the same sbt type and the same pattern of tandem repeat variation. this resulted in the removal of  <dig> strains from our analysis, leaving  <dig> environmental strains,  <dig> clinical strains, and  <dig> hot springs strains for a total of  <dig> strains .

the average number of repeats for each gene was calculated across each of the three remaining categories of strains . the data was found to have unequal variance between categories , therefore the means were compared using a two-tailed heteroscedastic t-test . from a clinical perspective, the most important comparison is between the environmental and clinical samples. genes lpg <dig>  lpg <dig>  lpg <dig> and lpg <dig> all exhibited significant differences in repeat distribution between clinical and environmental isolates. in all of these cases repeat numbers were higher in the clinical samples than in the environmental samples.

*values in bold were considered significant . the mean of each population  was compared using a two-tailed heteroscedastic t-test.

stability of repeat number
most tandemly repeated sequences are known to be able to mutate at a faster rate than non-tandemly repeated sequences . therefore, we were interested in examining the stability of these repeats over time, to ensure that our data do not simply represent a "snapshot" in time of repeat copy number in these strains. we began by serially passaging identical cultures of the philadelphia strain at various temperatures for three months . at the end of this period, we measured the repeat copy number in each of the  <dig> candidate repeat arrays and found that none of them had varied over this time span . because two of the  <dig> candidate genes are involved in uvb resistance  we also examined the stability of these two repeats under repeated exposure to uv light. plates of philadelphia strain were exposed to varying lengths  of uvb radiation just after streaking at each passage . while there was a noticeable effect on survival of the bacteria, after  <dig> generations no changes in repeat number were observed for either lpg <dig> or lpg <dig> .

discussion
while bacteria in general appear to have a large number of tandem repeats, the possible phenotypic effects of intragenic repeats are only beginning to be examined. evidence exists from other organisms that variable number tandem repeats are involved in the evolution of new genes, gene regulation, adaptation, resistance to environmental stresses, and avoidance of the immune system. in this work, we have investigated the presence and variability in copy number of tandemly repeated sequences in the genome of l. pneumophila, an important human pathogen and model for the study of host-pathogen interactions. we have identified  <dig> genes containing tandem repeats and determined that seven of them exhibited variability in repeat copy number between strains.

more importantly, we have demonstrated that the distribution of repeat variation is significantly non-random in l. pneumophila and therefore may have functional implications. our results suggest that the number of intragenic tandem repeats found within most genes varies as a function of strain origin. six of the seven genes examined display distinctive differences between the three groups of strains examined . in particular, four genes exhibit significant differences in repeat copy number between environmental and clinical samples. moreover, for three of the four genes, the distribution of repeat copy number is also significant between clinical samples and hot springs samples, further highlighting the potential significance of the higher repeat copy number found in clinical samples for these genes.

one possible complication with an experiment of this nature is the rate of change of repeat copy number. while a variety of studies have been undertaken examining the mechanism and stability of tandem repeats, none of them addressed intragenic tandem repeats in particular and most have focused on smaller microsatellites   <cit> . in our hands, none of these larger repeats changed in copy number through multiple generations under a variety of conditions. while these conditions do not accurately substitute for a competitive natural environment, these experiments do suggest that intragenic repeat number is reasonably stable over time.

the four genes which exhibit significant differences in repeat copy number between environmental and clinical samples are of particular interest from a clinical perspective since tandem repeats in these genes could play roles in the pathogenesis of l. pneumophila. lpg <dig> is annotated as "vrrb" in the published sequence, however we have been unable to verify any nucleotide or protein homology with the "variable region with repetitive sequence b"  gene from bacillus anthracis  <cit> . furthermore, blast searches with this sequence do not produce any significant hits other than those from the published l. pneumophila sequences. it is therefore possible that this gene may represent a novel virulence factor in which tandem repeats could play a functional role. lpg <dig> is homologous to the fimv gene described in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . this gene is thought to be involved in twitching motility, possibly through the remodeling of the peptidoglycan layer to enable assembly of type iv pili. twitching motility is known to be important in the virulence of p. aeruginosa, however it has not yet been described in l. pneumophila. lpg <dig> is a gene of unknown function but contains an ankyrin repeat sequence, thought to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and which have been recently demonstrated to play a role in the manipulation of l. pneumophila host physiology and infection  <cit> . lastly, lpg <dig> encodes an effecter of the icm/dot type iv secretion system and is known to play a role in the release of l. pneumophila from a protozoan host  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results provide a detailed examination of variable intragenic tandem repeat distribution as a function of strain origin. these data suggest a potential functional role of tandem repeats in adaptation to different environments. current work is focused on understanding the exact role that intragenic tandem repeats play in particular genes.
