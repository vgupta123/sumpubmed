BACKGROUND
riboflavin  is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide  and flavin adenine dinucleotide , essential cofactors for many metabolic enzymes implicated in multiple cellular processes . plants can synthesize riboflavin while the levels vary widely in different organs and during different stages of development, suggesting that changes in riboflavin levels may cause physiological effects  <cit> . foliar application of riboflavin increases the intrinsic concentrations of all flavins , alters cellular redox, and induces defense responses to pathogens . the foliar flavin content can be also modulated by transgenic expression of the turtle  gene encoding riboflavin-binding protein   <cit> . the protein contains a nitroxyl-terminal  ligand-binding domain, which is implicated in molecular interactions, and a carboxyl-terminal  phosphorylated domain, which accommodates the riboflavin molecule . in the rfbp-expressing  arabidopsis thaliana line, the rfbp protein localizes to chloroplasts, binds with riboflavin to decrease free flavin concentrations in leaves, and enhances the plant resistance to diseases  <cit> . the induction of disease resistance accompanies elevated cytosolic levels of hydrogen peroxide , a cellular signal that can regulate defense responses  <cit> . all of these rfbp-conferred responses can be eliminated by nullifying rfbp expression and abolishing production of the rfbp protein. the rfbp-silenced  arabidopsis line generated under rfbp+ background resembles the wild-type  plant in the leaf flavin content, disease resistance, and h2o <dig> production  <cit> . these findings support the notion that changing flavin concentrations has biological consequences  <cit> .

rfbp is a phosphoglycoprotein that was first isolated from the white of chicken egg  <cit>  and then identified in different species of both ovipara and mammals, such as emu  <cit> , amphibian  <cit> , fish  <cit> , and humans  <cit> . in ovipara, the rfbp gene is expressed in the liver and oviduct in an estrogen-dependent manner, and is also expressed in oocytes subsequent to fecundation  <cit> . the estrogen-dependent and fecundation-induced expression patterns are also found in mammals  <cit> . regarding to the rfbp protein, it is mainly produced in the blood plasma of podocyte and localizes to the plasma membrane via the n-terminal ligand-binding domain  <cit> . rfbp also employs the c-terminal phosphorylated domain to tightly bind riboflavin in a 1: <dig> molar ratio . owing to these features, rfbp functions to mediate the cellular translocation of riboflavin in the animals  <cit> . the animals absorb riboflavin directly from dietary sources  <cit>  or produce this vitamin through conversions from ingested fmn and fad  <cit> . in both cases, rfbp acts to redistribute riboflavin between cells and organs  <cit> . moreover, rfbp adopts a ligand-receptor binding manner  <cit>  to mediate riboflavin translocation into the growing embryo  <cit> . either riboflavin deficit or insufficient decomposition of the riboflavin-rfbp complex is fatal to embryogenesis  <cit> . these findings suggest that rfbp plays an important role in the animal development. in agreement with this role, we unexpectedly found that the arabidopsis rfbp+ line flowered earlier than wt and rfbp− plants  <cit> . this serendipitous phenomenon suggests that the de novo expression of rfbp may affect the regulation of flowering time in the plant.

plant flowering time is mainly controlled by four genetic pathways that are well characterized in arabidopsis  <cit> . the photoperiod and vernalization pathways regulate flowering in response to the length of the day and a long period of cold, respectively  <cit> . the gibberellin  pathway refers to the requirement of ga for normal flowering patterns  <cit> . the autonomous pathway indicates flowering regulation in a photoperiod and ga independent manner  <cit> . these pathways may interact  <cit>  through multiple regulators, such as the putative zinc finger transcription factor co   <cit> , the florigen protein ft   <cit> , and the circadian clock oscillators toc <dig>  and cca <dig>   <cit> . as a result, the expression of floral meristem identity  genes, such as ap <dig>   <cit> , is induced at the shoot apex to promote the growth of floral organ primordia, which form flowers in the subsequent days  <cit> . a main purpose of this study was to elucidate which of the four floral pathways is related to the early flowering phenotype associated with downregulation of free flavin concentrations by rfbp.

RESULTS
rfbp reduces leaf flavin content in long days and short days
recently we showed that leaf flavin  concentrations were significantly reduced in the arabidopsis rfbp+  line than in wt or rfbp−  plants under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle  <cit> . this photoperiod is not well suited for the study of flowering regulation, but instead, short day is specified to be an 8-hour light/16-hour dark cycle while long day indicates 16-hour light  <cit> . therefore, we changed to grow wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− plants under long day  and short day  conditions, respectively. we retested the rfbp gene expression, rfbp protein production, and free flavin concentrations in the two youngest expanded leaves of 10-day-old plants from long days and 25-day-old plants from short days according to flowering time of the different plants .

in parallel tests of plants under long days or short days, the rfbp gene was highly expressed  and a substantial amount of the rfbp protein was produced  in leaves of rfbp+ in contrast to the absence of gene expression and protein production in the wt plant. the gene expression and protein production were highly reduced in the rfbp− plant . in long days, free riboflavin, fmn, and fad concentrations were decreased by 60%, 52%, and 69%, respectively, in leaves of rfbp+ compared to wt, but in rfbp−, flavins were retrieved to approximations of wt levels . similar differences were found in rfbp expression , the protein production , and flavin concentrations  among wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− under short days. leaf flavin concentrations were decreased approximately by 20% in all plants grown in long days compared to short days . these analyses suggest that downregulation of free flavin concentrations in leaves is a constant character of the rfbp+ plant under short day and long day conditions.figure  <dig>

the wt plant took  <dig> and 47 days to flower with  <dig> and  <dig> rosette leaves in long days  and short days , respectively. rfbp− resembled wt in flowering time and rosette leaf number but rfbp+ flowered 6 days earlier with a reduction of  <dig> rosette leaves in long days  and flowered 15 days earlier with a shortage of  <dig> rosette leaves in short days . like rfbp+, other rfbp-expressing lines  <cit>  also acquired the early flowering phenotype . thus, early flowering is a constant character of rfbp-expressing plants.figure  <dig>

to elucidate the effect of leaf flavin concentrations on flowering, we performed a pharmacological study in which plants under long days were fed with an aqueous solution of riboflavin or treated with ultrapure water as a control. riboflavin feeding caused substantial increases in the leaf content of all flavins, and flavin concentrations in riboflavin-fed rfbp+ were retrieved to the approximations in water-treated wt plants . rfbp− resembled wt in the riboflavin-feeding effects on leaf flavin content . all plants flowered later and had more rosette leaves following riboflavin feeding compared to control while riboflavin-fed rfbp+ plants lost the early flowering phenotype . these observations are in agreement with the rfbp silencing effect and both lines of evidence attribute the early flowering phenotype to the reduction of leaf flavin concentrations.figure  <dig>

flavin content downregulation enhances foliar expression of floral promoting photoperiod genes
to infer the molecular basis of rfbp-induced early flowering, we compared wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− plants in terms of the expression of  <dig> flowering regulatory genes assigned to photoperiod , vernalization , ga , and autonomous  pathways. plants were grown in long days and sampled during 10– <dig> days after seed germination. gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  using constitutively expressed ef1α and actin <dig> genes as references. rnas used in the analysis were isolated from the two youngest expanded leaves at 13 hours in light , a time point at which floral promoting genes are highly expressed under regulation of the circadian clock, a central player in the photoperiod pathway  <cit> .

chronological patterns of gene expression analyzed every other day during 10– <dig> days of plant growth are provided in figure  <dig>  the seven genes assigned to the vernalization, ga, or autonomous pathway were little expressed in all plants while the seven photoperiod genes behaved differently. regarding to photoperiod, red/far red light receptor phytochromes phya and phyb  <cit>  and blue light receptor cryptochromes cry <dig> and cry <dig>  <cit>  serve as the entry of the clock  <cit> , which employs the negative cca <dig> and toc <dig> transcriptional feedback loop to control day-night rhythm of photoperiod gene expression  <cit> . rfbp did not cause evident effect on cca <dig> as its expression levels were similar in all plants through out the course of time. phyb expression was decreased with time in all plants but decreasing extents were significantly  smaller in rfbp+ compared to wt or rfbp−. expression levels of five other photoperiod genes , which are flowering activators  <cit> , were highly elevated as compared to controls  and sharp elevations were detected approximately four days before flowering in all plants. however, rfbp+ was more vigorous than wt and rfbp− in chronologically increased expression of the photoperiod genes. their expression was highly enhanced in rfbp+ compared to wt or rfbp− at every time point during 10– <dig> days. during this period multiples of expression enhancements by rfbp were  <dig> – <dig>  for phya,  <dig> – <dig>  for cry <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  for cry <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  for toc <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  for co. clearly, rfbp+ enhances the foliar expression of floral promoting photoperiod genes .figure  <dig>

the effect of rfbp on gene expression was cancelled by the riboflavin feeding treatment , which annulled the early flowering phenotype and also eliminated approximate rfbp-reduced parts of the intrinsic flavin content in rfbp+ leaves . the endogenous flavin concentrations were increased  and expression levels of the five floral promoting photoperiod genes were decreased significantly  in leaves of wt and rfbp− plants fed with riboflavin compared to water . therefore, free flavin concentrations negatively affect rfbp-enhanced expression of the floral promoting photoperiod genes in leaves with long days.

rfbp enhances ft expression in leaves and coordinate fd and ap <dig> expression in the shoot apex
the circadian clock exit gene co  <cit>  is one of rfbp-induced photoperiod genes . in response to the photoperiod signal, co is produced as an output of the circadian clock and acts in turn to activate the expression of the florigen gene ft in leaves  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, marked expression of ft was detected in leaves of 12- and 18-day-old plants with greater quantities in rfbp+ than in wt or rfbp− under long day condition. interestingly, ft still displayed substantial expression in rfbp+ on the flowering day . as shown in figure 5b, quantities of the ft transcript in the different plants with long days were markedly increasing since 10 days of growth, reached the highest values on two days before flowering, and started to decline gradually after flowering. thus, chronological patterns of ft expression were similar in all plants during 10– <dig> days of growth in long days. however, ft expression levels kept greater at every time point and was increased earlier with significantly  higher extents in leaves of rfbp+ compared to wt and rfbp− .figure  <dig>

as a result of the photoperiod regulation, the florigen ft protein moves from leaves to the shoot apex  <cit> , where it functions with fd to activate ap <dig>  <cit> , which marks the beginning of floral organ formation  <cit> . at the transcription level, the fd and ap <dig> genes are coordinately expressed at the shoot apex to initiate flowering by promoting the growth of floral organ primordia  <cit> . to elucidate the role of fd and ap <dig> in rfbp-induced flowering, we analyzed their expression in shoot apices of 12- and 18-day-old plants. we detected concomitant expression of fd and ap <dig> from all plants  and significantly  higher amounts of gene transcripts in rfbp+ than in wt or rfbp− . clearly, the de novo expression of rfbp affects the synchronized expression of fd and ap <dig> at the shoot apex.figure  <dig>

rfbp enhances expression of photoperiod and ft genes in leaves and expression of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices under inductive photoperiod
to further elucidate the molecular basis of rfbp-induced early flowering, we tested the expression of ft and flowering regulatory genes in leaves and the expression of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices of wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− plants under inductive photoperiod. this condition was devised by considering:  rfbp+ flowers after 32 days while wt and rfbp− flower after  <dig> and 46 days of growth in short days ; and  floral organ primordia can well grow within five days and differentiate into floral organs in the subsequent days under inductive photoperiod  <cit> . therefore, we employed the inductive photoperiod by growing plants in short days for 23 days and transferred them to long days. we analyzed gene expression immediately  after inductive photoperiod and in the subsequent nine days.

as shown in figure  <dig>  inductive photoperiod caused different effects on the foliar expression of genes assigned to different floral pathways and the effects were also different in rfbp+ from wt and rfbp−. in all plants, inductive photoperiod did not cause evident effect on cca <dig> or genes assigned to vernalization, ga, and autonomous pathways in comparison with transcript ratios between reference genes actin <dig> and ef1α. inductive photoperiod repressed the expression of phyb and repression extents were significantly  lower in rfbp+ leaves than in leaves of wt or rfbp−. in comparison to transcript ratios between actin <dig> and ef1α, expression levels of floral promoting photoperiod genes phya, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  toc <dig>  and co in leaves of all plants were increased by inductive photoperiod. these genes were expressed in a similar chronological pattern. expression levels were increased slightly in 3 days in rfbp+ and 5 days in wt and rfbp−, reached the highest levels in the next two days, and then declined in all plants. at every time point, extents by which inductive photoperiod acted to enhance the expression of phya, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  toc <dig>  and co were significantly  greater in rfbp+ leaves than in leaves of wt or rfbp−.figure  <dig>

in all plants, inductive photoperiod caused enhancements in the foliar expression of ft  and the expression of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices . nevertheless, enhancement extents were significantly  greater in rfbp+ than in wt or rfbp−. in all plants, moreover, expression levels of ft in leaves and expression levels of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices were increased in six days and then the foliar expression of ft was continuously increased  but the apical expression of fd and ap <dig> remained stable till the ninth day .figure  <dig>

taken together, these analyses suggest that the de novo expression of rfbp in arabidopsis enhances the expression of ft and floral promoting photoperiod genes in leaves and also enhances the expression of fd and ap <dig> in the shoot apex under inductive photoperiod. gene expression enhancements are significant in the rfbp+ plant compared to wt or rfbp− background.

reduction of leaf flavin content is responsible for enhancements of the gene expression under inductive photoperiod
to correlate leaf flavin content with rfbp-enhanced gene expression under inductive photoperiod, we tried to increase flavin levels by feeding plants with riboflavin and analyzed phya, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  cca <dig>  toc <dig>  co, ft, fd, and ap <dig> expression at the fifth day after inductive photoperiod, a time point at which these genes are highly expressed in leaves or shoot apices in the absence of riboflavin feeding . under inductive photoperiod, feeding plants with riboflavin caused substantial increases in leaf concentrations of all flavins, and flavin levels in riboflavin-fed rfbp+ were retrieved to the approximations in water-treated wt plants . rfbp− resembled wt in the riboflavin-feeding effects on leaf flavin content . in all plants, cca <dig> expression in leaves was unaffected, but the foliar expression of phya, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  toc <dig>  co, and ft in leaves  and the expression of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices  were decreased by the riboflavin feeding treatment compared to water. riboflavin-fed rfbp+ plants performed similarly to water-treated wt or rfbp− plants in gene expression. in rfbp+, therefore, enhancements of ft and photoperiod gene expression in leaves, and enhancements of fd and ap <dig> expression in the shoot apex, are caused by the reduction of leaf flavin concentrations.figure  <dig>

discussion
the well-demonstrated developmental role of oviparous rfbp in riboflavin binding and redistribution  <cit>  inspired the idea to manipulate plant riboflavin content by engineering with the turtle rfbp  <cit> . its activity in riboflavin binding allows for the function in modulating free flavin concentrations in transgenic plants  <cit> . on this basis, in the present study we have characterized the serendipitous role of the rfbp protein in affecting flowering time after de novo expression in arabidopsis. we investigated arabidopsis rfbp+ and rfbp− lines in comparison with the wt plant  and demonstrated that rfbp-caused downregulation of free flavin content in leaves  induced the early flowering phenotype . by feeding plants with riboflavin to increase the intrinsic content of free flavins and determining the subsequent effect on flowering time, analyzing the pharmacological data together with those about the rfbp+ vs. rfbp− effects, we were able to attribute the early flowering phenotype to the reduction of free flavin concentrations in leaves  on the basis of rfbp binding with riboflavin inside leaf cells  <cit> .

riboflavin is a venerable multifaceted player in tremendous biochemical processes and frequently receives renascent attentions with newly discovered functions . since its discovery in  <dig> and biochemical characterization in  <dig>  a variety of physiological roles that flavins play in plants have been extensively studied  <cit> . in particular, previously unappreciated functions have been often reported in recent 10 years. for example, genetic modification of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway alters some aspects of plant development, such as leaf senescence regulated by the cos <dig> protein, an essential component of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway  <cit> . in fact, cos <dig> is the lumazine synthase  <cit> , which catalyzes the penultimate step of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . arabidopsis mutants that have partial defect in cos <dig> and partial decrease in riboflavin content compromise the regulatory role of jasmonic acid in leaf senescence  <cit> . in plants, moreover, externally applied riboflavin induces resistance to pathogens by priming of defense responses in a manner of salicylic acid dependence or independence according to the type of pathogens, biotrophic or necrotrophic  <cit> . externally applied riboflavin also induces plant growth enhancement by activating the ethylene signaling pathway  <cit> . these findings suggest that changes in riboflavin content cause physiological and pathological responses by affecting phytohormone signaling pathways. through studies detailed here, novel functions of flavins have been extended from cellular signaling to flowering time control in relation to the expression of photoperiod and flowering time genes.

the expression of photoperiod and flowering time genes is implicated in rfbp-induced flowering based on several lines of evidence . first, rfbp+ causes enhanced expression of five photoperiod genes , which are flowering activators  <cit> , in leaves under long day  or inductive photoperiod  conditions. by contrast, phyb is a flowering repressor  <cit>  and phyb expression is repressed by rfbp in contrast to the early flowering phenotype and rfbp-enhanced expression of the floral promoting photoperiod genes . in addition, cca <dig> is highly expressed in the early phase and its expression declines in the late phase of day , explaining why rfbp is unable to affect cca <dig> expression. similarly, genes assigned to autonomous, gibberellin, and vernalization pathways are not related to rfbp-induced early flowering . second, enhanced expression of the photoperiod genes was correlated with enhanced expression of ft in leaves . the ft protein is the florigen that can moves from leaves to shoot apices  <cit> , where it functions with fd to activate ap <dig> for the growth of floral organs  <cit> . third, concomitantly enhanced expression of ft and photoperiod genes was further correlated with the synchronized expression of fd and ap <dig> in the shoot apex , while synchronized expression of fd and ap <dig> in the shoot apex initiates floral organ formation  <cit> . the role of rfbp in gene expression is attributable to reduction of free flavin levels in leaves .

as flavins anticipate in numerous biochemical processes, it is difficult to elucidate the functional relationship between downregulated flavin concentrations and the photoperiod pathway. a possible mediator is h2o <dig>  a cellular signal that can be induced by the de novo rfbp expression and downregulation of free flavin content inside arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . h2o <dig> has been implicated in crosstalk with flowering regulators  <cit>  and actually participates in the regulation of flowering time . for example, flowering is promoted when cytosolic h2o <dig> levels are elevated by the activity of chloroplastic lipoxygenase or ascorbate peroxidase in arabidopsis  <cit> . as downregulation of free flavin concentrations in leaves by rfbp induces the production of the h2o <dig> signal and its translocation from the apoplast to the cytosol  <cit> , the signal may act in turn to promote flowering  <cit> . alternatively, h2o <dig> may be generated through electron leakage from the mitochondrial electron transport chain due to shortage of fmn and fad, which serve as redox centers in the chain .

CONCLUSIONS
meticulous phenotypic observations indicate that early flowering is a constant character conferred by the de novo expression of rfbp in transgenic arabidopsis plants grown in short days and long days. the phenotype is caused indirectly by downregulation of free flavin concentrations in leaves based on pertinent analyses of the rfbp+ vs. rfbp− effects, as well as the pharmacological consequence from the riboflavin feeding treatment, performed under long days and inductive photoperiod. under both conditions, reduction of leaf flavin content induces the expression of floral promoting photoperiod genes in leaves, coincident expression of the florigen gene ft in leaves, and synchronized expression of the flowering regulatory gene fd and the floral meristem identity gene ap <dig> in the shoot apex. we don’t have evidence to show the connection between changes in flavin concentrations and any of the floral regulators. in fact, we found the early flowering phenomenon by accident, but we don’t know what it means with respect to photoperiod gene expression and flowering time control.
