BACKGROUND
regardless of their chemical and physical nature, all stressors influence organisms by changing the cell functioning. this is achieved through alterations in the genome function that manifest themselves by changes in the expression and activity of certain genes  <cit> . several avenues are available for a stressor to influence the gene expression. it can be achieved directly through the damaging of gene's dna, indirectly through the mechanisms of damage detection followed by the induction of stress response, or by direct action of stressor on the components of intracellular signaling machinery   <cit> .

the term "genotoxicants" refers to the factors that are capable of inflicting the damage to dna molecules. dna is the most vulnerable among all cellular structures. by coding all proteins the cell needs, dna orchestrates the cellular activity. however, a single cell possesses only two copies of each dna molecule. while other damaged macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates may be replaced by intact copies, the dna damage can lead to disastrous consequences. by causing inheritable changes in the generations of cells and organisms, genotoxic agents affect the incidence of human diseases and biodiversity of biota  <cit> . they cause heritable adverse effects among the offspring, increase the rate of cancer development and accelerate aging  <cit> .

in response to the damage of dna or other cellular structures, the stress response based on the changes in the level of expression of certain genes gets generated  <cit> . for certain genes this may be an increase in the activity while for others the activity diminishes. some of these changes have a protective, adaptive character, while others are the result of the genome dysfunction . it can be assumed that adaptive changes have deterministic and reproducible nature since they were formed as a result of long evolution of the stress response. the effects of genome malfunctioning are stochastic in nature: they depend on the locus of damaged dna, its position in euchromatin or heterochromatin regions, the importance of the damaged gene for the functioning of certain cell type during certain period of ontogenesis, and the number and extent of the lesions.

recently we have studied genome-wide transcriptional response to ionizing radiation, formaldehyde, toluene, and  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure on drosophila melanogaster whole-animal model  <cit> . the rna-seq analysis on  <dig>  transcripts revealed both significant similarities and differences in differential gene expression and the activity of biological processes under the influence of each treatment. some of the observed transcriptional changes in stress can be regarded as protective and adaptive in nature , while the rest are related to the dysfunction of cellular systems   <cit> . the transcriptome changes in response to all the studied types of stresses involve differential regulation of a large common cluster of the genes, most of them earlier identified as related to genome maintenance or aging.

in another recent work, brown et al. studied the transcriptional effects of environmental perturbations  in drosophila model  <cit> . they found a uniform response to environmental stressors. the changes in the activity of most genes is reproduced after most of studied treatments  <cit> . the unregulated genes included those annotated with the go term ‘‘response to stimulus, go:0050896’’, and those that encode lysozymes, cytochrome p450s, and mitochrondrial components mt:atpase <dig>  mt:coi, mt:coiii. the downregulated genes encoded egg-shell, yolk and seminal fluid proteins  <cit> .

in addition, environmental pollutants may influence the intracellular signaling machinery that mediates the regulation of gene expression. for example, ionizing radiation is capable of causing the formation of reactive oxygen species which damage various proteins including regulatory ones  <cit> . formaldehyde promotes formation of protein-protein and dna-protein crosslinks  <cit> .  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is not a direct genotoxicant but it binds to an intracellular protein, aryl hydrocarbon receptor   <cit> . the latter is a transcriptional enhancer that influences expression of some key cellular genes.

development of new effective test systems for the detection of environmental mutagens at low concentrations is an important practical task. biosensor is a biological detector  that can respond, in a predictable manner, to the investigated factor . currently, the measurements of the damage level are widely used for the purposes of revealing the effects of environmental pollutants. commonly used damage indicators include the number of micronuclei in the bone marrow of animals, anaphase bridges and fragments, and the proportion of damaged dna determined by the dna comet assay the methods of genetic analysis, however, are labor-intensive. identification of adaptive changes in the gene expression may be a more reliable and less time consuming way of bio-sensing of damaging effects compared to the measurement of stochastic damages, particularly at low concentrations  of damaging factor.

from the bio-sensing point of view, the small doses of ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxins are some of the most relevant environmental factors. they are important due to their prevalence and the risk of long-term effects. the purpose of this study was to identify the similarities and differences in effects of low doses of ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxin on the expression of genes in different mammalian species . the data on the gene expression are among the most important objects of study of the modern bioinformatics. the bioinformatics analysis conducted in this work can become the basis for new methods of the pollutants bio-sensing in the environment, in particular for the establishment of biosensor expression chips  or pcr sets .

RESULTS
additional file  <dig> table s <dig> combines the literature data on the genes that get activated in response to low doses of radiation, formaldehyde and dioxins. as the table shows, only a small proportion of these genes overlap and get activated by several different exposures. genes trp <dig>  cdkn1a and areg are activated under the influence of both ionizing radiation and formaldehyde. induction of genes cdkn1a, bax, areg, egr <dig> and tnf is observed under the influence of both radiation and dioxin. dioxin and formaldehyde can both cause expression of genes cdkn1a and areg. only two genes from the list, cdkn1a and areg, respond to all three types of pollutants. at the same time, the analysis of gene ontology annotated for presented genes shows a much more significant overlapping in the functions of these genes. two hundred gene ontologies are common for all genes and influences. a considerable number of other ontologies overlap within the pairs of analyzed influences. in particular,  <dig> common biological processes were observed for the effects of dioxin and radiation,  <dig> - for radiation and formaldehyde,  <dig> - for formaldehyde and dioxin. comparison of the number of genes involved in a particular process during different influences  shows that all three analyzed pollutants substantially activate p <dig>  atm and mapk stress response signaling pathways, cell cycle regulating genes, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

the differences in the effects of investigated pollutants are as interesting as their common features. radiation increases the expression of cell differentiation genes and genes involved in apoptosis and response to dna damage. it causes stress induction of heat shock proteins and cellular senescence . dioxin induces the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs by cytochrome p <dig>  metabolism of retinol and tryptophan, as well as chemical carcinogenesis. it stimulates oxidative stress through the transcription factor nrf <dig>  it also influences the hematopoiesis process . formaldehyde influenced the genes of the circadian cycle and stress kinase p <dig>  caused the endoplasmic reticulum stress and g2/m cell cycle checkpoint . interestingly, the adverse factors studied in this work were activating the genes involved in the development of various neoplastic processes and certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis c and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . thus, the pollutants are able to promote pathologies, contribute to their development or cause them in the first place .

the analysis of interactions between the products of activated genes revealed that in ionizing radiation group the egf receptor may be activated by amphiregulin protein. in turn, egf receptor conveys the signal towards fas receptor, c-raf- <dig> and erk <dig>  erk <dig> could possibly transmit the signal to p <dig> and dna polymerase beta via activation of parp- <dig>  p <dig> stands as the most interconnected gene in this group. it activates another transcriptional factor egr <dig> that up-regulates sod <dig>  bax, tnf-alpha, egfr, erk <dig>  egr <dig> and p <dig>  egr <dig> is one of the most connected elements in the network and is very involved in stress response. the p53-egr <dig> duet could possibly serve as a trigger for the response to ionizing radiation .

in formaldehyde-activated gene group, p <dig> also is the most interconnected node of the network . it activates hsp <dig>  egr <dig>  mdm <dig>  mdm <dig>  p <dig> and inhibits urokinase receptor, heme oxygenase  <dig>  c/ebp zeta and hsp <dig>  activator protein  <dig>  also activates hsp <dig> and p <dig>  but unlike p <dig> it activates heme oxygenase  <dig>  upregulated rna polymerase ii engages in heat shock response by activating hsp <dig> which may be also activated by serpin peptidase inhibitor .

in case of gene group activated by dioxin exposure we can see significant upregulation of various ligands. this could be explained by the action of several transcriptional factors: irf <dig>  c-jun, egr <dig>  c/ebpbeta .

discussion
the obtained bioinformatics analysis data point to the induction of both common and different molecular processes by low-dose ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxin. the similarity of ionizing radiation and formaldehyde effects on gene expression was also observed in our recent investigation performed on drosophila  <cit> . the most similar set of changes revealed in drosophila for 'dioxin and radiation' is also confirmed by bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . the homogeneous response to different kind of environmental perturbations, such as cold, heat, caffeine, paraquat, rotenone, copper, zinc, and cadmium was also found by brown et al. in drosophila model  <cit> .

the activation of stress response genes after exposure to ionizing radiation and pollutants can cause or aggravate the development of various chronic diseases on the organismal level. moreover recently we have demonstrated that the majority of stress response genes are highly interconnected and may cause longevity or aging depending on the exposure dose  <cit> .

the differences in the spectrum of expressed genes induced by different factors can serve as a basis for the development of new methods of revealing of the effects of environmental pollutants. these methods could be based on bio-sensing of impact through quantifying the mrnas of suitable genes by rt-pcr, expression chips or rna-seq. the transgenic organisms with green fluorescent protein  gene expression driven by the promoter of unique genes may be used for detection of low doses of ionizing radiation and pollutants.

CONCLUSIONS
thus the observed patterns of changes in gene expression levels provide new insights into the mechanisms of the deleterious effects of the exposure to ionizing radiation and chemical pollutants. these data can also be used for bio-sensing of pollutants in the environment and combating the adverse effects.
