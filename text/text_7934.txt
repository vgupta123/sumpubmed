BACKGROUND
the hormonal control of fruit growth and development has been well established across many different plants. one hormone, auxin, has been shown to control the initial growth and expansion of tissues following fertilisation  <cit>  and inhibit ripening. early work with strawberry and other fruits proposed a mechanism whereby auxin produced by the developing seed regulated fruit growth by controlling firstly cell division and secondly cell expansion. as the seeds subsequently mature, auxin concentrations drop, acting as a signal for ripening to proceed. supporting this mechanism is the observation that applied auxins can induce parthenocarpy in fruits such as tomato  <cit> , fruit size in peach  <cit> , cell enlargement in cherry  <cit>  and delay ripening in strawberry  <cit> . developmental regulation by the principal auxin in higher plants, iaa , is achieved through the coordination of complex processes: auxin metabolism , auxin transport  and auxin signalling . the balance of synthesis, breakdown, conjugation and transport is tightly regulated, leading to auxin homeostasis  <cit> .

de novo auxin synthesis in plants results from multiple pathways dependent or independent of tryptophan  <cit> . iaa can be conjugated to amino acids, sugars and methyl esters. enzymes that conjugate iaa to amino acids are encoded by members of the group ii of the gh <dig>  family of auxin-induced genes  <cit> . very little is known about the role of gh <dig> genes during fruit development. however, it has recently been shown in grape that gh <dig>  plays a role in the formation of iaa-asp late during development, coinciding with the onset of ripening  <cit> . release of iaa from iaa conjugates is achieved by hydrolytic cleavage  <cit> . auxin transport from sites of synthesis to target cells is complex and highly regulated, playing a crucial role in both establishing and changing homeostasis. auxin is transported both passively through the vasculature and actively through transporters  <cit> . the most characterised auxin transport family is the efflux carrier pin family. pin proteins are vital for normal plant development. mutations in the pin <dig> gene lead to pin-like organs with no development of flower parts in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit>  and members of the pin family are highly expressed early during tomato fruit development, suggesting a role during fruit set  <cit> .

the current model for auxin perception and signalling involves two types of receptors  <cit> : the auxin binding protein  <dig> , located at the plasma membrane, and the transport inhibitor 1/auxin signalling f-box family , a set of nuclear receptors  <cit> . abp <dig> is involved in very early auxin responses leading, for example, to the modification of ion fluxes  <cit> . abp <dig> has been shown to be essential for plant life  and is important for both cell division and cell expansion  <cit> . however, the details of the pathway going through abp <dig> are poorly understood. in tomato, the diageotropica  mutant displays many auxin-related developmental defects and fruit development is dramatically altered, with a reduced fruit size  <cit> . dgt encodes a cyclophilin, known to act as signalling intermediate, and was shown to use abp <dig> as an extracellular receptor for auxin-dependent cell growth response  <cit> . the signalling pathway involving tir <dig> is now well characterised and explains most of auxin-regulated gene expression  <cit> . the three families of early auxin responsive genes, aux/iaa, gh <dig> and saur , contain a binding motif to the arf transcription factor . at low auxin concentrations, a heterodimer of an arf and an aux/iaa protein represses transcription. at higher auxin concentration, auxin will bind to tir1/afb, an f-box protein that is part of an scf complex , and triggers the degradation of the repressor aux/iaa through the 26s proteasome. this will ultimately release the arf transcription factor to modulate expression of early auxin response genes. in fleshy fruits, most of our knowledge involving the arf-aux/iaa complex during fruit development comes from studies in tomato. slarf <dig> is expressed in placental and ovule tissues and down-regulated soon after pollination. silencing of the slarf <dig> gene leads to parthenocarpic fruit development, showing that slarf <dig> functions as a negative regulator of fruit set  <cit> . similarly, silencing of the sliaa <dig> gene expression also confers parthenocarpy  <cit> . slarf <dig>  seems to play a role later in fruit development, as its expression increases throughout tomato fruit development, with the highest levels in early red-stage fruit. down-regulation of slarf <dig> leads to pleiotropic phenotypes including dark-green immature fruit, enhanced firmness and unusual cell division in the fruit pericarp, which is thicker than in wild-type  fruits  <cit> .

while many fleshy fruits are carpel derived, the fruit from malus x domestica  is unusual, as it is derived from the hypanthium, a tube of fused sepals, petals and anther derived tissue. however, like other fruits, apple development can be separated into periods of cell division, cell expansion, maturity, and ripening  <cit> . while there have been a few studies on auxin content in apple  <cit> , there is little research reported on the role of auxin in apple fruit development at the molecular level. there are a large number of different cultivars of apples showing a range of different flowering times, maturity times and times to ripen. one cultivar, 'royal gala', is a naturally occurring sport of the 'gala' cultivar. it is a mid-season apple, and its growth and development has been well characterised. 'royal gala' has been the subject of a number of genomics studies, including a large-scale expressed sequencing tag  sequencing project  <cit>  and a microarray study of the fruit development  <cit>  and fruit ripening  <cit> . it is readily transformable, with transgenic apples for aco <dig> suppression  <cit> , myb <dig> overexpression  <cit> , and polygalacturonase  <dig>  <cit>  being reported. recently a parent of 'royal gala', 'golden delicious', has had its genome sequenced  <cit> .

here we have investigated the role of auxin on apple fruit development and assessed the expression of genes involved in homeostasis, transport and signalling of auxin. the location of auxin-related genes in the genome sequence of apple was compared with qtls for fruit weight, which is linked to fruit size.

RESULTS
changes in auxin content over fruit development
apple fruit have previously been given four distinct developmental stages following pollination, consisting of stage  <dig> , stage  <dig> , stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig>   <cit> . in 'royal gala' apples, stage  <dig> takes 0- <dig> days after full bloom , rapid growth  covers 20- <dig> dafb, after which the fruit continue to grow at a slower rate as the fruit matures , with the ripening process starting around  <dig> dafb , with tree-ripe eating apples at  <dig> dafb  <cit> .

to investigate the role of auxin during fruit development, the free iaa amounts were measured at representative times  during the different fruit development stages in 'royal gala' fruit cortex and seed. iaa concentrations in the seed showed a large increase during fruit development, reaching a maximum concentration of  <dig> ng/g fresh weight  . the iaa concentrations in the fruit cortex were considerably lower than in the seed, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ng/g fw, with a significant increase during cell expansion . this is consistent with the literature, showing high auxin concentrations in the seeds of tomato and strawberry, compared with those in the fruits  <cit> .

effect of auxin treatment on apple fruit growth
as there was an increase in auxin in the cortex tissue during stage  <dig> , we assessed the effect of injecting three auxin concentrations within the physiologically active range for auxins  into fruit at the beginning of stage  <dig> . the growth of each apple was assessed by recording the diameter of the fruit at injection and after two weeks of subsequent growth. during the two-week period, all fruit showed an increase in fruit size . the two lowest auxin concentrations  caused a significant increase in fruit diameter compared with the control , while the highest concentration  appeared to inhibit fruit growth. the increased fruit growth observed with the 10- <dig> m and 10- <dig> m treatments corresponded to a greater increase in the cell size  compared with that of control apples. during the early stages of apple development, there is a natural self-thinning event. apples typically have  <dig> florets per cluster, which for commercial purposes are thinned to 1- <dig> fruit per cluster, depending on the localised fruit load. two to three apples were chosen per cluster for injection and the rest were hand thinned. during the two-week treatment, the control showed a 32% fruit drop. when injected with auxin at 10- <dig> m and 10- <dig> m, a higher degree of fruit retention was observed, with only 14% fruit dropped in the 10- <dig> m treatment. additional auxin promoted fruit drop, with 48% fruit abscised from the  <dig> - <dig> m concentration .

genomic screening of auxin-related genes in the apple genome
the apple draft genome  <cit>  was screened for six classes of auxin-related genes. these included the receptor-like genes abp <dig> and tir1/afb, the transcriptional control genes arf and aux/iaa, and the auxin homeostasis genes, the pin genes and gh3-like genes. all six classes of genes searched were well represented in the apple genome . the apple genome has been shown to have undergone a genome duplication, so the numbers of genes were compared with the numbers of auxin-related genes in the recently published woodland strawberry genome  <cit>   . in each gene family, there are approximately twice the numbers of auxin-related genes in apple than in strawberry.

arabidopsis
a phylogenetic analysis of the six classes of genes using the predicted protein sequence from apple, strawberry, tomato and arabidopsis was performed for each class of genes . in each of the phylogenetic clusters, the majority of the apple genes were contained in subclades consisting of a single strawberry gene. these subclades typically had two apple duplicated genes for each strawberry gene, with the occasional subclade showing a single apple gene, or three apple genes per strawberry gene. this 2: <dig> ratio of genes was robustly observed in the abp <dig>  tir1/afb and arf class of genes, with aux/iaa, gh <dig> and pin showing a less robust pattern with some strawberry and apple genes showing no corresponding related sequences. the predicted location of the two apple duplicates genes were often found on homeologous chromosomes identified in the apple genome  <cit>  , with duplicated genes found on non-homeologous chromosomes occurring 18% of the time. because of this tight phylogenetic relationship between the strawberry genes and two apple genes, when possible both apple homologues were named after the already annotated strawberry genes, for example arf <dig> of strawberry clustered with genes in apple that were labelled arf <dig> and arf <dig>  this nomenclature was not followed if the gene had previously been published or released in genbank. with these genes, the existing name was kept .

while the gene families from the two rosaceae species, strawberry and apple, were tightly aligned with each other, there was considerable divergence from the arabidopsis genes. for example, there is evidence of clade expansion in the arf genes in arabidopsis including the atarfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . the tir1-like proteins also suggests small family expansion in arabidopsis . small subclades containing only proteins from strawberry, apple and tomato were also observed.

expression analysis of auxin-related genes during apple fruit development
gene expression for each of the auxin-related genes was screened using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  across flowering and at time points representing the four stages of apple fruit development  . some of the homeologous genes showed very little sequence divergence at the dna level, making it hard to select optimal qpcr primers that were specific for each gene in the homeologous pairs. of the  <dig> genes tested,  <dig> primer pairs were predicted to be unable to differentiate between the homeologues . in these instances, the expression patterns are given with both names  or marked with an asterisk .

the genes were divided into three main functional groups for analysis: receptors , homeostasis  and response . when it was possible to differentiate the homeologous genes, the expression patterns within each pair were compared with each other. there were a considerable number of homeologous genes with different expression patterns and also instances where one of the homeologous genes was apparently switched off, for example abp <dig> and abp <dig> . this may be because of the quality of the primer, or actual lack of expression. to address this concern, we examined the est libraries  <cit>  for ests corresponding to the  <dig> receptor-like genes, and used diagnostic dna polymorphisms to identify each of the homeologues. from these sequence data, it appears that abp <dig> is transcribed and abp <dig> is not . for the tir1/afb class there was a similar pattern, with tir <dig>  afb <dig>  and afb <dig> having ests, while tir <dig>  afb <dig>  and afb <dig> were not represented, suggesting that the transcription of these genes is suppressed. for the apparent lowly expressed afb <dig> and afb <dig> there were no ests with which to compare. both the abp <dig> and tir <dig> class of receptor genes were expressed constitutively through fruit development. in the tir1/afb family, afb <dig> showed a stage  <dig> and  <dig> predominant expression, while afb <dig> showed a high degree of expression at stage  <dig> fruit development .

pin <dig> showed the highest expression only during the cell division , while pin <dig> and pin <dig> showed predominant expression as the fruit progressed into maturity and ripening  . half the gh <dig> conjugating proteins showed high expression levels early in fruit development - cell division , while all were suppressed during stages 2- <dig> , with a number increasing again as the fruit ripened .

many of the arf/aux/iaa family of genes had discrete expression patterns for a single stage of fruit development . half the differentially expressed genes were predominantly expressed during the early stages of fruit development, with a high proportion of aux/iaa genes being highly expressed at full bloom. as auxin has been shown to be central to the regulation of fruit size, which is determined during cell division and cell expansion, we were particularly interested in profiles that had high expression in stages  <dig> and  <dig>  in this cluster, four arf and two aux/iaa had highest expression during stage  <dig>  while arf <dig> had peak expression at stage  <dig>  it had a very low expression level. only two genes had high expression during both these two stages  , suggesting these two genes may play a role in the control cell division and/or expansion affecting final fruit size.

qtl mapping for fruit size
to assess regions controlling fruit size in apples, two mapping populations were assessed for fruit weight, as a surrogate for fruit size, over a number of successive years. fruit weight was phenotyped for a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genotypes from 'royal gala' × 'braeburn'  and 'starkrimson' × 'granny smith'  mapping populations. measurements were made over  <dig> and  <dig> years of production, and two and one sites, respectively. analysis of variance showed that the genotypic  and the year  effects for fruit weight were highly significant for each population . for the rgxbb population, the effects of the growing environment  and its interaction with the genotype  were highly significant. best linear unbiased predictors  independent of year and environment were extracted for each genotype for both studied populations and were used as phenotypic data for qtl detection. six qtl regions were identified for fruit weight using the rgxbb and stkxgs genetic maps on linkage group   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . two qtl regions were conserved across both segregating populations on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  the explained genetic variability  for each of the qtls ranged between  <dig> % for a 'royal gala' qtl on lg  <dig> to  <dig> % for a 'granny smith' qtl on lg  <dig>  the global r <dig> were higher in the stkxgs segregating population  than in the rgxbb . the qtls detected in the rgxbb segregating population were not involved in any epistasic effect, whereas the three fruit weight qtls detected in the stkxgs population on lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were involved in an epistatic effect.

characteristics of the qtls detected on separated parental genetic maps, 'royal gala', 'braeburn' , 'starkrimson' and 'granny smith'  map by multiple qtl mapping  mapping for fruit weight. qtl detection was carried out using best linear unbiased predictor  as phenotypic data. different blup values were extracted to represent genetic potential for each genotype , fruit weight in a given year calculated from the genotype × year  interaction, and fruit weight in a given environment calculated from the genotype × environment  interaction. for the rgxbb population, blup values were extracted for the genotype , the interaction g × y , and the interaction g × e . for the stkxgs population, blup values were extracted for the genotype  and for each year . for each qtl, the table displays the marker used as a co-factor for mqm analysis, the lod score, and the percentage of genetic variation explained by each single qtl . when several qtls were detected for the same trait, the global r <dig>  and the interactions between qtls are indicated.

the six qtl regions were compared with the in silico locations of auxin genes that showed predominant expression during stages  <dig> and  <dig>  arf <dig> is located on lg  <dig> and could account for the fruit weight qtl on this linkage group. the genetic marker developed from the sequence of arf <dig> had the highest lod score  for the fruit weight qtl, in both the 'royal gala' and 'starkrimson' × 'granny smith' genetic maps . the qtl interval spanned an overlapping area between both stkxgs and rgxbb qtls, of  <dig>  mb, from markers ch03b <dig>  to gdsnp <dig> . within this region, in addition to arf <dig> ,  <dig> other predicted gene models were found . while some of these genes showed homology to arabidopsis genes that have annotated gene ontology, which may control fruit size, such as involvement in cell division, cell cycle and signal transduction , these were not studied further as they were outside the scope of this project.

the lg  <dig> and  <dig> qtls were mapped in duplicated regions of the apple genome because of whole genome duplication  <cit> . the homeologous gene to arf <dig> is arf <dig>  while expressed later in fruit development, there is still the possibility that arf <dig> retains some residual fruit size control. the genetic marker developed from arf <dig> mapped to the fruit size qtl but was not the strongest marker in this region .

discussion
with the availability of the whole genome sequence for apple  <cit> , there is now the possibility of identifying the complete gene family for different classes of genes. this powerful resource has been used to identify individual auxin gene classes  in a number of plants including arabidopsis  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . the auxin signal has been implicated in many components of fruit growth and development, including determination of fruit size through cell expansion, as well as the control of fruit ripening, and the regulation of fruit drop  <cit> . here we have presented a genomics screen in apple of different auxin-related genes, covering perception, homeostasis and transcriptional regulation, and their relative expression patterns over fruit development. these expression data provide the ground work for further studies in the role of auxin on apple fruit growth and development.

fruit size determination
there are a number of factors that regulate fruit size in apples, those that are controlled by the genetic make-up of the apple , and those related to the environment in which the apple develops. the environmental control of size is determined by both the effects of orchard husbandry and irrigation and local effects in the apple tree, such as fertilisation success, and localised crop load. we demonstrated that in the rgxbb segregating population, the effect of the year, the environment and its interaction with the genotype were highly significant. furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the global phenotypic variation explained by the qtls for fruit size detected in the two segregating populations. the larger explained phenotypic variation for the stkxgs population can be explained by the fact this population was grafted on less dwarfing rootstock  than the rgxbb . in addition, the crop load for the rgxbb was regulated, while the stkxgs was not. while the environment can cause significant amounts of variation, the genetic size potential of the fruit is a major determinant of fruit size. this work and others have shown that size potential is a complex multi-loci trait in apples  <cit>  and other fruits such as tomato  <cit> . the control of fruit size in apples has been linked to both the number of cell division steps that occur directly following pollination and to subsequent cell expansion  <cit> . apples have been shown to have a range of different cell sizes across different cultivars  <cit> , and increasing cell number and size through endo-reduplication causes a 38% increase in fruit weight  <cit> . our work suggests that auxin signals through this cell division/cell expansion phase may be modulated by an arf gene  that is up-regulated during these developmental time points and co-locates with a stable qtl for fruit weight. arf <dig> is most closely linked to the atarf <dig>  which is microrna controlled and when over-expressed using a microrna-resistant form, gives a pleotropic phenotype  <cit>  including excess tissue growth in leaves. the corresponding arf in tomato slarf <dig> is expressed highly at fruit ripening .

the balance of auxin is critical for fruit expansion. this auxin signalling is complex, as not only can the presence of auxin elicit a developmental response, but different concentrations can cause different responses  <cit> . here we found that injecting different concentrations of auxin could cause an increased cell expansion, decreased fruit growth, and ultimately fruit drop  <cit> . the increased cell growth with lower amounts of injected auxin suggests that fruit growth is at least in part limited by auxin concentration, as application of more can enhance it, which is consistent with the observations of percy and collaborators  <cit> .

extensive molecular research on auxin in arabidopsis has now identified a number of key genes involved in the regulation of auxin content of plant tissue, and the method by which the auxin signal is converted into a developmental change. part of the complexity of the auxin signal transduction can be explained by the regulation of response genes: by developmentally regulating both the signal transduction transcription factors  and the modulators of transcription , a complex network of regulation can be achieved. this complexity can explain how the same signalling molecule can relay different signals at different times during development  <cit> .

auxin-related processes in fruit set
while the molecular control of auxin is best understood in the model plant arabidopsis, which bears dry dehiscent fruit, there has been a substantial body of work in fleshy fruit species. surprisingly, for many of the arf proteins, the tomato orthologue  is more closely related to the apple gene than the arabidopsis orthologue . the arf proteins, which are more similar to those in tomato  are all expressed at a specific stage in fruit development . this may suggest a strong evolutionary pressure for conservation within fleshy fruit species. this conservation is also observed in the expression patterns presented in  <cit> , with genes such as mdarf113/slarf <dig>  mdarf4/slarf <dig> expressed at similar times in fruit development. the phylogenetic discrepancy is also observed in the iaa cluster ; however, there are currently no published genomics studies of iaa genes in tomato to make this comparison.

key auxin-related genes such as atarf <dig>  in arabidopsis and slarf <dig> in tomato have been associated with fruit set  <cit> . mutations in atarf <dig> and down-regulation of slarf <dig> cause parthenocarpic fruit in arabidopsis and tomato respectively, indicating that atarf <dig> is functionally equivalent to slarf <dig>  while it is not the closest homologue   <cit> . down-regulation of sliaa <dig> also leads to development of parthenocarpy and it has been hypothesised that it could work in the same pathway as slarf <dig>  <cit> . slarf <dig> clusters with arf <dig> and arf <dig>  atarf <dig> clusters with arf <dig> and arf <dig>  while sliaa <dig> clusters with iaa <dig>  iaa27a and iaa127a . of these apple genes, arf <dig> has highest expression at full bloom, like slarf <dig>  <cit>  , suggesting that this may play a similar role, while arf <dig> is undetectable.

auxin and ripening
the role of auxin in the regulation of ripening in strawberry has been well established after it was found that application of auxins through the peduncle caused a significant delay in ripening  <cit> . this link suggesting that auxin is a negative regulator of ripening was further enforced by a study over-expressing a pepper gh3-related gene in tomato  <cit> . in this study, the ccgh <dig> over-expressing lines matured earlier than untransformed lines and ripened earlier with the addition of exogenous ethylene. the closest homologue from of this ccgh <dig> in apple is gh <dig> , which also shows a large increase in expression around fruit maturity . interestingly, this gene is also expressed during the cell division stage. as well as the gh3-related genes, there is also a cluster of auxin signal transduction genes that are up-regulated at stage  <dig> , suggesting that an auxin signal can still be transduced at this stage. this is consistent with auxin playing a role in fruit maturation and ripening that is well known in non-climacteric fruits  <cit>  and beginning to be established in climacteric fruit  <cit> .

another gene in tomato sliaa <dig> is induced by both ethylene and auxin at fruit maturation  <cit> . sliaa <dig> clusters with iaa <dig> and iaa <dig>  neither of which is expressed at the ripening stage. however,  <dig> arf/aux/iaa genes are highly expressed at ripening, suggesting a similar role in apple. down-regulation of another tomato auxin response factor, slarf <dig>   <cit> , leads to unripe fruit that are firmer because of a perturbed pectin metabolism, and the fruit display an unusual cell division pattern in the pericarp. slarf <dig> clusters with arf <dig> and arf <dig>  of which arf <dig> is expressed during cell expansion and maturation. this differs slightly from slarf <dig>  which shows increasing expression during tomato fruit development, with the highest in ethylene-producing fruits.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has provided a genomics study of auxin regulation in apples, with many auxin-related genes changing through fruit development. the complexity of expression patterns of these genes suggests a complex role of auxin regulation in apple fruit development. exogenously applied auxin during the end of cell division/early cell expansion phase can increase fruit size, showing that auxin is at least in part one of the limiting factors controlling cell expansion. the role of one auxin response gene, arf <dig>  which maps to a size-related qtl, needs to be further investigated to determine if this gene plays a role in apple fruit size regulation.
