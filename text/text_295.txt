BACKGROUND
the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster is a highly popular model organism for behavioral studies. drosophila larvae display a rich collection of locomotive behaviors such as peristaltic crawling, pausing, and turning  <cit> . automatic, quantitative analysis of these behaviors is often needed to investigate the molecular and cellular circuitry modulating such behaviors.

there are two types of systems providing such analysis: single-animal tracker and multi-animal tracker. a multi-animal tracker records from a fixed position and analyzes all animals present in the view. a single-animal tracker often changes its position to follow one animal. in general, multi-animal trackers provide a higher throughput, and single-animal trackers enable a higher resolution. as single-animal trackers can use a higher magnification, more phenotypic details can be extracted from the images and videos.

an open-access multi-animal tracker with many powerful features has been successfully designed and used for drosophila larval locomotion analysis  <cit> . in contrast, there is no feature-rich single-animal tracker for drosophila larval locomotion analysis. the most used dias system was originally developed to study the crawling of amoeboid cells  <cit> . while it analyzes features such as speed and turns, it lacks drosophila specific parameters such as stride frequency. the software is also not open access. alternative software such as customized imagej plug-ins and matlab scripts have been used to measure several additional drosophila larval locomotion parameters  <cit> . however, these software programs are often limited to measurements of few parameters and specific experimental designs.

here we present maggottracker, an automatic single-animal tracking system for drosophila larval locomotion analysis. maggottracker has several advantages over existing single-animal systems. 1) it analyzes more drosophila larval locomotive parameters. the system measures over  <dig> parameters, ranging from the duration and distance of one stride to the shape of the entire track. 2) it provides higher resolutions, allowing detailed parameter measurements. for example, speed is measured at  <dig> equal-distance positions along the body. 3) it resolves the conflict of recording time and resolution by moving the microscope stage to keep the animal in the view field. while most current studies are limited to about 30 seconds of high-resolution recording  <cit> , the maggottracker has no limitations on how long an animal can be tracked and recorded even at the highest resolution. in this study, we demonstrate a 4-minute recording for each animal. 4) it is free to use. written in java, it does not require any commercial software such as labview or matlab. 5) it is open source, enabling future development to accommodate new analysis needs. the source codes can be downloaded at wormloco.org/mag.

RESULTS
hardware components of maggottracker
the hardware for maggottracker is composed of a digital camera, a dissecting microscope, a motorized stage, and a computer that controls the camera and the stage . we used a high magnification  microscope as we initially built this system for phenotyping of the much smaller animal c. elegans  <cit> . a setup with a lower magnification microscope or even no microscope should be sufficient for drosophila larval tracking.figure  <dig> 
components of the maggottracker system. wormtracker controls the hardware to track one animal and record a video. magrecognizer extracts  <dig> points equally distributed along the midline of the animal. magviewer displays the values of animal length and speed over time while simultaneously playing the video and showing the track of the animal. maganalyzer conducts batch processing of videos to extract mean parameter values over the entire recording time for all videos.



the system was placed in a 20°c environmental room so that all experiments were conducted under the same temperature. during tracking, an animal was placed on a 10 cm petri dish filled with  <dig> % agar. a transparent,  <dig> -cm-wide plastic ring was placed on the outer rim of the agar to prevent the animal from crawling to the edge of the plate . to optimize image processing, the camera was set to a high contrast so that the animal appeared black and the background was white.

software components of maggottracker
the software for maggottracker has four components, wormtracker, magrecognizer, magviewer and maganalyzer . all programs were written in java. wormtracker and magviewer work on pc computers while the other two programs work on both pc and mac computers.

wormtracker records a video and moves the motorized stage so that the animal remains in the viewing center. in addition to a video, the program generates a text file listing changes of the stage coordinates over time. this is the only component in the software that is not developed by us because several such programs already exist for monitoring c. elegans locomotion  <cit> . any of these programs would suffice. we used the wormtracker program developed by the schafer lab  <cit> .

magrecognizer reduces the animal to  <dig> evenly distributed points along the midline of the animal. it also uses the record of stage coordinates generated by the wormtracker to compute the position of the animal on the plate. it outputs the result in a text file listing the coordinates of the  <dig> points for each image frame in the video. this file serves as the input for both magviewer and maganalyzer.

magviewer dynamically displays the instantaneous values of locomotive parameters as the user plays a video. it generates a text file detailing the locomotive parameter values for each time point. it also generates an image file tracing the tracks of the animal.

maganalyzer performs batch processing of all videos in a given folder. for each video, it computes the averages of parameter values over the entire duration of the video. this program outputs a text file listing all videos and their parameter values, which can be directly imported into a database.

all software source codes can be freely downloaded  <cit> . the website also provides open-access documents such as a user manual, an installation instruction, and detailed experimental protocols.

maggottracker measures multiple locomotive parameters
drosophila larval locomotion patterns may be categorized as striding or non-striding  <cit>  . when an animal is striding, it displays a peristaltic movement: the animal extends and contracts rhythmically; it moves linearly covering a significant distance; the head and tail of the animal move at a similar speed during the extending and contracting phase, respectively . in contrast, a non-striding animal shows no rhythm in body length changes; it turns its head sideways and bends its body without traveling much distance; such head movements also cause the instantaneous speed of the head to be much greater than that of the tail .figure  <dig> 
sample parameters measured by maggottracker. more parameters measured by maggottracker can be found in table  <dig>  a) maggottracker measures animal movements. two 10-second videos of the same animal showed the differences between striding and non-striding movements. several parameters are measured during the striding phase only. for example, stride duration is the time for one peristalsis cycle; extension and contraction rates measure the rate of length changes. other parameters such as length and speed are measured at all time. some parameters such as speed are measured for each point along the midline from head to tail. b) maggottracker traces animal tracks. grey ring shows the position of the plastic ring used to prevent animals from crawling off the agar. direction change points are marked red. c) maggottracker measures animal shape. head angle and body angle are calculated to determine whether there is a head bend or a body bend.



backward movement was rarely observed in our tracking system. over 99% of all the animals we analyzed showed no backward movement at all. for the few animals that did move backward, the backward movement lasted only one or two strides during the four-minute video. therefore, the maggottracker does not specifically analyze backward movements. a previous study showed a much higher percentage of backward movement  <cit> . the difference may be caused by different experimental conditions .

maggottracker measures over  <dig> parameters to capture both of these locomotive patterns . these parameters describe the shape, peristaltic movement, stamina, and track of the animal. some of these parameters such as speed are measured for each of the  <dig> points along the body. in addition, some parameters such as length are measured for instantaneous values at each time point using magviewer, as well as average values over the entire video using maganalyzer.table  <dig>

definition of parameter

 <dig> these parameters are only measured for the video segments when the animal is striding.


 <dig> these parameters are measured in three ways: overall, inside, and outside. overall values evaluate the whole video. inside values evaluate the animal when it is away from the plastic. outside values evaluate the animal when it is close to or on the plastic ring. overall values were used by default unless otherwise specified.


 <dig> these parameters are measured over the entire video. they have one value data point from each video. the other parameters are measured for each frame. the mean value was used for each video.


 <dig> these parameters are measured for each of the  <dig> points along the midline. values for the center point, point  <dig>  were used by default unless otherwise specified.



variations of locomotive parameters
as the first application of the maggottracker, we used it to examine the locomotive behaviors of  <dig> wild-type canton-s animals. we measured the coefficient of variation , i.e., the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the mean, for each parameter. most parameters showed a low variation with cv values of less than 50% . in particular, all parameters measuring the peristalsis movement showed low cv values of less than 35% . these data suggested that these parameters are good indicators for phenotypic assessment. for the rest of the paper, we focus on these less variable parameters unless otherwise specified.table  <dig>

several parameters showed high variation with cv values higher than 50%. these parameters include bending time for head and/or body, number of direction change points on the track, stamina parameters measuring the distance, duration, and stride count for each run during which the animal strides continuously.

correlations of locomotive parameters
as canton-s animals showed a range of distanced travelled during the 4 minute time, we asked whether an animal covered more distance by spending more time striding or by moving faster when striding. correlation analysis of the parameters showed that distance is highly correlated to striding speed, but not striding time for these animals , suggesting that an animal covers more ground by striding faster rather than spending more time striding.figure  <dig>

we next asked whether a faster animal had bigger or faster steps. we analyzed the correlation between the striding speed and the distance and duration of one stride . striding speed positively correlated with stride distance and negatively correlated with stride duration , suggesting that a faster animal moved with both bigger and faster steps. these results are consistent with a previous report by berrigan and pepin  <cit> . another report by heckscher et al. showed that speed has a stronger correlation with stride duration than distance  <cit> . the difference might be caused by experimental conditions: heckscher et al. used a channel so that the movement of the animals were restricted to a linear fashion, while the animals were crawling on the surface of an agar plate, a two-dimensional space, in our experiment and the assays of berrigan and pepin.

several other parameters also showed high correlations with the absolute values of pearson correlation efficient above  <dig> . stride count is positively correlated to striding time and speed, while negatively correlated to the duration of one stride . body length measurements, such as average length, contracted body length, and extended body length, are highly correlated among themselves .

effects of gender, development, and medium surface on locomotion
while it is known that female drosophila larvae are bigger than males, it is unknown whether there are sexual dimorphisms in locomotive behaviors. to investigate this, we used the maggottracker to analyze  <dig> female and  <dig> male canton-s wandering third-instar larvae. these animals came from the same set of the  <dig> animals used in previous parameter correlation and variation analysis. our data showed that females have significantly longer body length than males , consistent with previous reports  <cit> . however, despite of the size difference, males and females showed no significant differences in all other locomotive parameters we measured . for example, they are indistinguishable in striding speed and striding time .figure  <dig> 
factors affecting locomotive behaviours. all graphs are histograms comparing locomotive parameter values such as time striding  and speed striding  of males vs. females , 2nd vs. 3rd instar animals , and animals traveling inside on agar vs. outside on the plastic ring . graphs on the right show sexual dimorphism in body length , body length normalized striding speed , and percentage of time that animals spent inside on the agar .



we also compared second and third instar larvae, and found that they had drastic difference in most locomotive parameters . second instars moved at a slower speed and spent less time striding . to examine whether the slower speed of second instars are due to its smaller size, we normalized the speed with body length. the speed difference between second and third instars is smaller but still significant when it is length-normalized . 89% of second instar larvae moved less than 11% of their body length per second, while 84% of third instar larvae moved over 11% of their body length per second . these data suggested that smaller body length is not the only contributing factor of the slower speed for second instars. as the contraction and extension rates of second instars are significantly lower , it is likely that second instars are weaker. it is possible that other factors such as lack of motivation may also contribute to the slower speed of second instars.

because our setup used a plastic ring to prevent the animals from crawling out, we analyzed our data on  <dig> canton-s third instars to assess how the locomotion behaviors changed when the animals moved from agar to the plastic ring. no significant difference was observed in most locomotive parameters . for example, the striding speed of the animals remained the same on both surfaces . one exception was that the animals spent significantly less time striding when they were next to or on the plastic . as most animals spent the majority of their time away from the plastic on the agar , the plastic ring in our setup may have little impact on the overall locomotive parameter values.

use of maggottracker to quantify mutant phenotypes
our primary goal of designing maggottracker is to use it for quantitative phenotyping. as locomotive behaviors are affected by many factors such as environmental factors, it is thus important to isolate genetic effects from other factors. to evaluate the influences of non-genetic factors, we examined animals of the same genotype tested on different dates. for example, our canton-s data were collected on  <dig> independent trial dates. overall, little difference in parameter values was observed in most of our experiments conducted on different dates. the variations of mean values from day to day are smaller than the animal-to-animal variations for all parameters . however, there are a few cases when parameter values differed significantly for the same genotype tested on different dates . these cases were all linked to two experimenters and we suspected that the cause of such variations was the small difference in age of the animals or some uncontrolled environmental factors. normalizing the values using a control strain tested on the same day seemed to eliminate such influences. for example, both canton-s and shaker  animals showed lower striding speed in the experiment conducted on 2013/01/ <dig> than that of 2012/05/ <dig> . when the mean value of the same-day-tracked canton-s animals was used to normalize the values, the normalized sh values are similar in both experiments . it should be noted that the day-to-day variation in this example represented the most extreme case. the striding speed for canton-s animals on these two dates  deviated considerably from the mean speed from all dates  in opposite directions. since normalization functioned effectively even in such extreme cases, we used normalized values for all our genetic analysis.figure  <dig>

the first set of mutants we analyzed was circadian mutants. locomotor activities in adult flies are regulated by circadian rhythms  <cit> . while no circadian locomotive rhythms have been reported in larvae, circadian genes are known to regulate the larval light avoidance behavior  <cit> . as larvae are placed under light in the recording system of maggottracker, we questioned whether circadian genes can affect the locomotive patterns under such conditions. we analyzed mutants of various circadian genes such as clock , period , timeout, timeless  and pigment-dispersing factor . pdf, timeout, and timeless mutants were on a white  background, therefore, w instead of canton-s animals were used as the control. for this experiment, the animals were raised under 12-light and 12-hour dark cycles. third instar larvae for each genotype were analyzed during the light cycle. we first examined the overall speed of the mutants to see whether they have a larval locomotor phenotype similar to that in the adult flies. the overall speed of most mutants showed no significant difference from controls with slightly lower means and comparable variations . only clk mutant larvae showed significantly reduced speed . a similar pattern was observed for other parameters with most mutants showing no significant phenotypes . as clk is a transcription factor upstream of most other circadian genes  <cit> , it may have circadian-independent functions affecting locomotive behaviors. it is also possible that the observed locomotive phenotypes of clk may be caused by a background mutation. a second clk allele or a rescue experiment is needed to confirm the role of clk in regulating locomotive behaviors. overall, as most circadian mutants showed no phenotypes, our data suggested that circadian mechanisms do not affect the locomotive parameters measured under our experimental conditions.

next we analyzed a set of mutants that are known to have locomotive phenotypes in adult flies, including mutants of k+ channel genes ether a go-go , hyperkinetic , shaker , slowpoke , and the na+ channel gene paralytic   <cit> . sh, eag, and hk mutant adult flies have anesthesia-induced leg shaking  <cit> . adult flies of para mutants have temperature-induced paralysis  <cit> . we also examined mutants of the c-amp phosphodiesterase gene dunce . while dnc mutants were first identified for adult learning defects  <cit> , they also have defects in larval neuromuscular junctions   <cit> . although dnc mutants appear normal in several general behaviors  <cit> , some adult locomotive phenotypes have been reported with the dnc <dig> allele such as reduced “centrophobism”   <cit> . therefore, it is possible that dnc <dig> animals may also have larval locomotive phenotypes.

the maggottracker analysis showed that while para and hk larvae displayed little locomotive phenotypes, dnc, eag, and sh larvae had severe phenotypes in multiple locomotive parameters such as stride distance and speed . sh larvae showed the most extensive phenotypes with significant defects  in ten locomotive parameters . some parameters such as time striding were also more variable in eag and sh mutants . however, data from more mutants are needed to detect possible correlations between phenotypic severity and variability of a parameter.figure  <dig>

our phenotypic measurements of eag, and sh in stride duration and distance are consistent with previously published results  <cit> . in both studies, eag and sh had no significant phenotypes in stride duration, and showed significant decrease in stride distance. the mean normalized stride distances of eag and sh are also similar . one group reported that para and hk larvae had slower crawling speed  <cit>  although we did not observe significant differences between these animals and the control canton-s animals. the discrepancy can be caused by different alleles , different experimental conditions such as assay temperature , and media . it may also be caused by analysis methods because we normalized all data using control animals tracked on the same day.

as maggottracker analyzes multiple parameters, the resulting phenotypic profile can provide additional information on phenotypic patterns. for example, mutants of the three k+ channel encoding genes eag, sh and slo showed highly similar phenotypic profiles with a pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig>  between sh and eag,  <dig>  between slo and eag . in contrast, the pearson correlation coefficient between dnc and eag is only − <dig>  . these data suggested that maggotracker is an effective phenotyping tool, detecting differences not only in parameter values but also in phenotypic patterns.

discussion
maggottracker provides medium-throughput phenotyping. the most labor- and time- intensive part is tracking the animals, as each animal needs to be picked from a vial, sexed under a microscope, and acclimated to the agar plate before being tracked for four minutes. this step takes about 6 minutes per animal. the throughput of this step can be increased by setting up multiple trackers to conduct parallel tracking. our throughput is  <dig> videos per hour with one person operating four trackers. the subsequent analysis step takes about 4 minutes per video. this step is fully automatic and can be done in batch processing; therefore, one can simply let the program run overnight to process all videos.

while multi-animal trackers can provide higher throughput of animals examined, single-animal trackers can have unique advantages in analyzing drosophila larval movement in addition to higher resolutions. a recent study showed that drosophila larvae secret pheromones that attract other larvae  <cit> . therefore, tracking a single animal can separate locomotive phenotypes from larva-interaction phenotypes such as pheromone-sensing defects.

additional features can be added to the maggottracker in the future to extend its application. for example, the current image settings were not optimized for segment detections. therefore, the system cannot directly measure coordination defects such as the timing of the contraction of each segment. this could be changed with adjustment of lighting and/or usage of gfp markers  <cit> . additional hardware such as leds will enable applications such as gfp detection and optogenetic analysis. our system detected that sh and eag mutants travelled a shorter distance during a peristalsis cycle, had fewer strides in total, and moved at a slower speed. all these phenotypes could be at least partly contributed by coordination defects  <cit> . therefore, it would be interesting to implement software modules to detect additional phenotypes such as coordination. as our software is open-source, such additional modules can be easily added.

tools similar to the maggottracker have been implemented in other organisms such as c. elegans  <cit>  for quantitative phenotyping of locomotive behaviors. while most parameters are different as c. elegans and drosophila larvae have different crawling patterns , parameters such as speed and length are measured in both animals. in this study, we found that eag mutants moved at a slower speed and dnc mutants moved at a higher speed than canton-s . similar phenotypes were found in c. elegans, where mutants of the eag ortholog egl- <dig> also have a reduced speed  <cit>  and mutants of the dnc ortholog pde- <dig> are hyperactive  <cit> , suggesting some conservation of gene functions. it would be interesting to conduct large-scale quantitative phenotyping of locomotive behaviors in drosophila and compare the results with those from c. elegans  <cit>  to systematically evaluate such functional conservation. the maggottracker provides a useful tool to address such questions.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed maggottracker, an automated phenotyping system to analyze drosophila larval locomotion at a high resolution. analysis of selected wild-type and mutant animals showed that maggottracker is an effective tool for quantifying changes in locomotive behaviors.
