BACKGROUND
arterial smooth muscle cells  are essential for the formation and function of the cardiovascular system. abnormalities in their growth can cause a wide range of human disorders such as atherosclerosis, the principal cause for heart failure, thus the leading cause for deaths in the western world  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms that regulate smc growth and differentiation are unclear partly due to the lack of specific markers and defined in vitro differentiation systems  <cit> . the recently discovered aortic preferentially expressed protein- <dig>  may serve as a sensitive marker for vascular smc differentiation. apeg- <dig> is expressed in differentiated vascular smc in vivo and was found to be down-regulated rapidly in de-differentiated vascular smc in vitro and in injured arteries in vivo  <cit> .

recently, three additional, larger products of the apeg- <dig> gene have been identified in rodents: in striated muscle, spegα and spegβ, and in the brain, bpeg  <cit> . the originally discovered apeg- <dig> mrna is transcribed from a different promoter than the spegβ mrna. this promoter is located between two exons of the much larger spegβ open reading frame. spegβ contains a serine/threonine kinase domain, and several immunoglobulin and fibronectin structural domains. the immunoglobulin sequences and the pattern of surrounding domains of speg proteins have significant homology with the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase  and the giant muscle protein titin. therefore, it has been hypothesized that all four protein products of the apeg- <dig> gene  are part of the functionally and structurally diverse smmlck protein family  <cit> .

the amino acid sequence of apeg- <dig>  defines a single ig-like domain . ig-like domains adopt a greek-key β-sandwich fold and contain two β-sheets that pack against each other. in ig-like domains of the i-set, one sheet is composed of four β-strands  and the other comprises five β-strands   <cit> . a disulfide bond is formed between strands b and f in most of the extracellular ig domains which is essential for their structural integrity  <cit>  whereas intracellular ig domains are stabilized by a hydrophobic core  <cit> . biochemical studies suggest that apeg- <dig> is a nuclear protein  <cit>  despite the as yet unrecognized nuclear localization signal  <cit> . ig domains interact with a wide variety of other proteins either by end-to-end contacts of the loops from opposite ends of the β-sandwich or by sheet-sheet contacts  <cit> .

a prosite database  <cit>  search revealed that apeg- <dig> contains an arg-gly-asp  adhesion recognition motif. the rgd motif is found in a number of proteins that play a role in cell adhesion, including some forms of collagens, fibrinogen, vitronectin, von willebrand factor , snake disintegrins and slime mold dicoidins . the rgd sequence is also found in several important extracellular matrix proteins and serves as an adhesion ligand for members of the integrin family of cell-surface receptors  <cit> . experimentally determined structures of cell-adhesion proteins reveal that the rgd motif is localized within loop regions and can adopt a broad set of conformations  <cit> .

the protein structure factory  <cit>  is developing novel strategies to address targets of its homo sapiens structural genomics effort which initially failed to yield good quality crystals. in this paper, we describe the success in crystallization of apeg- <dig> by truncation of an amino-terminal region that is predicted to be disordered according to bioinformatic analyses  <cit> .

RESULTS
protein production strategy
since the full-length apeg- <dig> could not be crystallized, a novel strategy for protein production  <cit>  was applied. structurally disordered regions of the protein were predicted with coils, remark <dig> and hot loops from the disembl™ package  <cit>  and with pondr®  <cit> . the program pondr® predicted disorder at the n-terminus up to amino acid  <dig> whereas coils and remark <dig> predict a disordered stretch up to amino acid  <dig>  however, due to the start of the ig domain at residue  <dig>  disorder is unlikely beyond this point.

pondr® predicted thirteen c-terminal residues to be disordered which is contradictory to the results obtained with coils which predicts order in this region. coils has been proposed to be effective as a filter to remove false positive predictions made by other networks  <cit> . these analyses show that it may be helpful to consider more than one disorder prediction algorithm for correct assignment. in the structure, the c-terminus was later found to be ordered except for the very last amino acid.

the n-terminus was truncated by  <dig> residues, and the truncated  protein was prepared which showed monodispersity like the full-length protein. similar thermal stability was determined by differential scanning calorimetry for both proteins; the midpoints of the unfolding transition were  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for Δapeg- <dig> and apeg- <dig>  respectively.

structure description and comparison
the truncation approach proved successful, and the crystal structure of Δapeg- <dig> was determined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å .

we searched public databases for high resolution structures of immunoglobulin domains. the immunoglobulin structure with the highest resolution as yet was found to be pdb 1k5n   <cit> .

the structure of apeg- <dig> shows the intermediate set  immunoglobulin superfamily fold  <cit>  which consists of a β-sandwich forming a central hydrophobic core. the front sheet comprises strands a'gfcc' which are arranged with a' and g parallel and gfcc' anti-parallel, whereas the back sheet comprises strands abed oriented anti-parallel to one another. in addition, one  <dig> helix containing the rgd sequence lies near the c-terminus. the main hydrophobic core of the domain is formed around the aromatic residues w <dig>  f <dig> and y <dig> .

the structural topology of Δapeg- <dig> closely resembles that of the prototypical i set domains of the ig fold superfamily  <cit> , such as those found in telokin   <cit>  and the i <dig> domain of the striated muscle protein titin   <cit>  . telokin is identical to the c-terminal domain of myosin light chain kinase  which is a key enzyme in the regulation of contractile activity in smooth muscle. both apeg- <dig> and telokin are proteins that contain an ig-like domain and represent a small portion of a larger muscle kinase   <cit> .

a disulfide linkage is normally present in extracellular immunoglobulin domains between strands b and f. in Δapeg- <dig> this is replaced by hydrophobic interactions between residues i <dig> and c <dig> in strands b and f, respectively . the other main hydrophobic residue pairs anchored in the core are v <dig>  – c <dig> , c <dig>  – s <dig> and l <dig> , and m <dig>  – y <dig> . the superposition of the structures of telokin, the titin i <dig> domain and Δapeg- <dig> reveals that the residues which compose the hydrophobic core are highly conserved in arrangement and packing volume.

telokin contains four cysteines in the core which have the potential to form two disulfide bonds. three of these cysteines are also present in Δapeg- <dig> . a disulfide bridge is observed in the structure of the titin i <dig> domain which was described as the first disulfide bridge found in an intracellular ig domain  <cit> . this bridge connects β-strands c and e  and thus the front and back sheets of the i <dig> β-sandwich. only one cysteine of this bridge is present in Δapeg- <dig> and no disulfide linkages were found . the alternative side chain conformation of c <dig> bears the potential to form a disulfide bond with c <dig> which would link the adjacent strands f and g of the front sheet of the β-sandwich. however, modeling with coot  <cit>  resulted in an s-s distance of  <dig>  Å, which is considerably longer than the normal disulfide bond of  <dig> – <dig>  Å.

the residues forming the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges at the interface region – e <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and d <dig> of the rgd motif – are highly conserved in the three proteins. however, a similar homodimeric arrangement was not observed in the structure of the i <dig> domain or telokin.

homophilic interaction
Δapeg- <dig> crystallized as a monomer in the asymmetric unit and an accessible surface area  of  <dig> Å <dig> was found for a single subunit. each Δapeg- <dig> molecule forms three distinct inter-protein contacts with neighbors, burying surface areas of  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . these values are all within the range of buried asa observed in protein dimer structures   <cit> . the large contact regions suggest that Δapeg- <dig> can form homophilic interactions. the homodimer with the largest buried surface area utilizes end-to-end packing with the subunits' n-termini pointing in opposite directions . the residues involved in formation of this dimer are exclusively located within the loop cluster between strands cc', c'd and ef which lie close to the c-terminus and within the  <dig> helix which contains the rgd motif. these loops are interconnected by salt bridges and a number of hydrogen bonds. the dimer interface includes two buried bi-dentate salt bridges – involving the rgd motif – between r65-d <dig> and r65'-d87' . these buried salt bridges are further stabilized by salt bridge interactions between e84-r65' and e84'-r <dig>  respectively, and the interactions between e33-r66' and r66-e33'. additionally, the dimer interface has several van der waals interactions and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between residues r <dig>  g <dig>  r <dig>  q <dig> and the symmetry-related mates r85', g86', r55', q58' which further stabilize the dimer interface. the backbone oxygen atom o of g <dig> is bonded to nζ <dig> of r <dig>  the last residue of strand c, and the backbone amide of r <dig> to the oxygen oε <dig> of e <dig>  a strong, but unfavorable, interaction between e84-d63', e84'-d <dig> is also observed at the dimer interface.

the quaternary structure was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium in an analytical ultracentrifuge. an average dimer dissociation constant of kd =  <dig> μm derived from the concentration-dependent mw measurements was obtained for both full-length apeg- <dig> and Δapeg- <dig> at  <dig> mm nacl, demonstrating the nearly identical amount of dimers . the dissociation constant was determined as a function of the salt concentration, and a pronounced correlation was found, as expected for interactions which are stabilized by salt bridges . the dissociation constant is increased hundred fold – from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm – when the salt concentration is increased from  <dig> to  <dig> mm.

discussion
prediction and removal of disordered regions proved to be a successful strategy for the crystallization and structural analysis of apeg- <dig>  we assume that the flexible, unstructured n-terminus was the reason for earlier failures to crystallize the full-length protein. the i set of ig proteins is characterized by a hydrophobic core that is important for their stability and activity  <cit> . the examination of the hydrophobic cores of several i-set proteins reveals that they are flexible and can tolerate considerable variation of hydrophobic residues particularly on the edges of the core  <cit> . the absolute invariants within the core are tryptophan  and tyrosine . a comparison of the structure with i-set domains of the muscle proteins telokin and titin reveals that residues get shuffled within the β-sheets causing local conformational changes in the side chains while the closely packed hydrophobic core is maintained. a disulfide bond links the two β-sheets of the titin i <dig> domain. no disulfide linkage was found in Δapeg- <dig>  a potential disulfide bond in Δapeg- <dig> would link adjacent strands of the front sheet of the β-sandwich.

to our knowledge, the apeg- <dig> structure has the highest resolution of all structures of ig domains currently present in the protein data bank.

a comparison of the c-terminal loop clusters of Δapeg- <dig> and the i <dig> domain of titin is of interest. residues at the interface and the hydrogen bonding network are conserved between the two. the i <dig> domain of titin forms homodimers in solution and in the crystalline state, but these have a different arrangement from the apeg- <dig> homodimers and do not appear to be physiologically relevant  <cit> .

the dimerisation of apeg- <dig> showed a very pronounced salt-dependence, which implies that it is caused by coulomb interactions. this supports the conclusion that the dimerisation observed with the sedimentation equilibrium technique involves the rgd motif and the salt bridges in the end-to-end contacts of the crystal structure. the dissociation constant of the apeg- <dig> dimer of  <dig> μm at physiological ionic strength is quite high and implies that apeg- <dig> dimerisation could only be transient at physiological conditions.

apeg- <dig> appears not only as an isolated protein, but also becomes part of the large protein kinase spegβ, an alternative product of the apeg- <dig> gene. the dimerisation of the apeg- <dig> ig-like domain could induce antiparallel homodimerisation of spegβ. this dimerisation could be stabilized by additional binding sites within the large spegβ protein.

the rgd motif is crucial for a number of extracellular protein binding events and cellular adhesion  <cit> . the structural flexibility of c-terminal loops with rgd motifs in published adhesion molecule structures was suggested to allow the molecules to adopt a broad range of conformations in molecular adhesion events  <cit> . rgd motifs in extracellular proteins have not been described to bind each other. in contrast to the flexibility of extracellular rgd-containing loops, the rgd sequence in apeg- <dig> forms a defined, rigid  <dig> helix. moreover, the apeg- <dig> rgd motif is only involved in intra-molecular salt bridges, while extracellular rgd motifs have been shown to be involved in inter-molecular salt bridges  <cit> . interestingly, the domains ig <dig> and ig <dig> of twitchin  <cit>  contain the rgd motif, and several domains in the titin i-band contain rgd or kgd motifs  <cit>  at the same position as in apeg- <dig>  apeg- <dig> is an intracellular protein which points to a possible role of the rgd motif not only in extracellular but also in intracellular protein-protein interactions. however, the way the rgd motif contributes to the homophilic interaction of apeg- <dig> is obviously quite different from the binding of rgd-containing flexible loops during cell adhesion events.

CONCLUSIONS
protein engineering facilitated the crystallization of apeg- <dig>  apeg- <dig> forms a homodimer which is stabilized by salt bridges. this dimerisation is not very strong and its physiogical relevance remains to be established. to our knowledge, the apeg- <dig> structure has the highest resolution of all structures of ig domains currently present in the protein data bank.
