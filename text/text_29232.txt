BACKGROUND
metabolomics, the chemical profiling of  cellular metabolites by their identification and quantification, is a rapidly expanding strategy in the post-genomics era complementing transcriptomics and proteomics thereby constituting a trilogy. metabolomics is regarded as the most promising among the  <dig> strategies particularly in plant science because plants have large and often polyploid genomes that seriously impede traditional genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches  <cit> . recent technological advances in mass spectrometry have realized reliable and highly sensitive measurements of metabolites. indeed, metabolomics has been utilized not only to investigate plant metabolism per se but also to identify unknown gene functions by comparing the profiles between wild-type and genetically altered plants or during developmental changes  <cit> . the popular metabolomics strategy is to focus on the pattern of metabolite concentrations under the given conditions. such quantitative information on metabolites has been used either to predict gene functions directly involved in metabolic processes  <cit> , to delineate metabolism and its regulatory networks  <cit> , or to distinguish metabolic phenotypes  <cit> .

metabolome changes are highly sensitive to the fluctuations in biological conditions as compared to transcriptome changes  <cit> . this is an intrinsic nature of metabolome as an ultimate cellular phenotype, and such small fluctuations in the metabolome across independent plants may provide information regarding the formation of metabolic networks  <cit> .

although there is a large potential to use vast metabolome datasets for the elucidation of metabolic networks, only limited datasets are publicly available. this is strikingly different from transcriptomics, in which a multitude of data for arabidopsis thaliana, the most widely studied model plant, is available in the public domain, e.g., atgenexpress  <cit> , athcor@csb.db  <cit> , genevestigator  <cit> , and atted-ii  <cit> . thus, previous metabolomics studies simply identified specific metabolite changes in order to explain a particular biological process under the given conditions. the current challenges are to figure out more detailed networks involving all the molecular elements  in a global manner across a variety of biological conditions.

in the present study aiming to computationally elucidate metabolic regulation in an unbiased manner, we focus on not only the changes in metabolite concentrations but also the metabolite correlations in a. thaliana mutants by means of gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry . we selected  <dig> representative mutants, namely, methionine-over accumulation  <dig>  and transparent testa <dig>  for primary and secondary metabolism, respectively. the mto <dig> mutant, caused by the lesion of the feedback regulation in methionine biosynthesis, is known to accumulate from 10- to 40-fold more soluble methionine than the wild-type  plant with few differences in other amino acid levels  <cit> . the tt <dig> mutant is deficient in a chalcone synthase  gene and thus cannot produce flavonoids – typical plant secondary products that function as protectants against abiotic stresses such as uv light  <cit> . this mutant is presumed to undergo various physiological changes triggered by flavonoids. since both the mutants reveal a so-called "silent phenotype" exhibiting no visible changes in development under normal growth conditions, these mutants would be ideal for the investigation of metabolotypes caused solely by a single genetic alteration and protected from secondary effects due to a developmental abnormality.

in general, interpretation of metabolite concentration is not straightforward. higher concentration of a metabolite, for example, may result from very high metabolic flux, accelerated production, decelerated degradation, or their combinations. one method to distinguish such flux modes is to look at metabolite correlations; from high correlation in metabolite concentrations we can hypothesize, although not conclusively, their co-existence in common metabolic pathways or coordinated regulation due to some biological mechanisms. indeed, metabolite correlations have been used in finding bottlenecks or metabolic shifts on pathways  <cit> , characterizing physiological response to environmental changes  <cit> , or simply as fingerprints of the underlying physiological states  <cit> . in the current analysis, we integrate metabolite correlation data with publicly available gene-coexpression data to obtain insights on the relationship between metabolites and gene regulations. this approach can relate metabolite correlation, at least partly, with the hidden coexpression of genes and lead us to the discovery of novel metabolite-gene networks.

RESULTS
metabolic profiles vary between wt, mto <dig> and tt <dig> mutants
the metabolome of the aerial regions of individual wt plants and the mto <dig> and tt <dig> mutants were analyzed by gc-tof/ms. the obtained raw data were imported to the matlab software for peak alignment and for extraction of spectra using a hierarchical multivariate curve resolution  method as described previously  <cit> . by this method, we could obtain faster a correct data table with peak areas, including corresponding mass spectra, than by commercial software often used for metabolome analysis  <cit> . the h-mcr process extracted  <dig> metabolite peaks and their mass spectra. using the national institute of standards and technology  and our custom software for spectral annotation ,  <dig> peaks were identified or annotated as known metabolites. in addition,  <dig> peaks were annotated with mass spectral tags   <cit> . these peaks were consistently observed though not identified completely.

for a total of  <dig> annotated peaks, partial least square-discriminate analysis  was applied as a multivariate statistical analysis. the scatter plot of pls-da scores showed clear separation among wt, mto <dig>  and tt <dig> with a good cross-validation result in accordance with their genetic background . the  <dig> mutants showed distinct metabolic snapshots that were consistent within each biological replicate of mutant plants.

subsequently, we searched the metabolites that contributed to this separation of the mutant profiles group from those of wt  . in order to filter the discriminative metabolites further, welch's t-test was conducted for annotated peaks by interpreting the first weight vector in the pls-da, assuming that metabolite concentrations follow the normal distribution in the same genetic background. between mto <dig> and wt,  <dig> peaks differed significantly, whereas  <dig> peaks were significantly different between tt <dig> and wt . the discriminative metabolites for mto <dig> were mostly amino and organic acids, whereas sugars and the precursors of secondary products were found as discriminative metabolites for tt <dig>  in mto <dig>  remarkable changes in methionine-related compounds such as methionine, homocysteine, and methionine sulfone were observed .

pronounced metabolite changes are observed in mto <dig> but fewer changes in tt4
in order to identify the metabolic pathways that were modulated in terms of metabolite levels, significant metabolite changes  observed in mto <dig> or tt <dig> against wt were compared on the metabolic map . only the peaks annotated as known compounds are projected in figure  <dig>  while a comprehensive list of all measured peaks and the changes of these levels are shown in additional file  <dig> 

in mto <dig>  a significant increase was observed in the levels of methionine , homocysteine , s-adenosyl-methionine , and methionine sulfone  . upregulation was also observed in the levels of ornithine, n-acetyl-ornithine, and arginine in the glutamate family. the levels of other amino acids in the aspartate family  were nearly consistent with the reported data  <cit> . in contrast, there was a significant decrease in the levels of pipecolate  and uracil .

less pronounced changes were observed in tt <dig> as compared to mto <dig>  the levels of major sugar pools, such as sucrose, glucose, and fructose, showed a significant decrease . in addition, a few components of the tricarboxylic acid  cycle and the shikimate pathway were slightly decreased in tt <dig>  the levels of shikimate, sinapate, and tyramine were decreased but that of tyrosine showed no change. the levels of all the amino acids remained unchanged in tt <dig>  suggesting that a lack of flavonoid biosynthesis does not largely affect the metabolism of amino acids.

metabolite correlations are similar between wt and tt <dig> but not mto1
in order to obtain insights into the regulation of metabolic network, we focused on the changes in metabolite-to-metabolite correlations in wt and the  <dig> mutants. considering the small fluctuations in metabolite levels across individual plants under a given growth condition, metabolite correlations are observed as a representative metabolic profile of a given genotype  <cit> . the correlation matrices of the wt plant and the  <dig> mutants were visualized by heat maps . the numbers of significantly correlated metabolite pairs in each genotype plant  in figure  <dig> indicated that mto <dig> lost metabolite correlations and tt <dig> strengthened correlations when compared with the wt plant, though wt and  <dig> mutants showed similar growth and phenotypes in the experimental condition, which was strictly controlled as much as possible. in wt and tt <dig>  fatty acids had a trend of negative correlation with all the other components. in contrast, fatty acids and steroids showed positive correlations with each other. for the sugar groups in wt and tt <dig>  fructose and glucose had a tendency of negative correlations with the other components; however, fructose-glucose correlated in a highly positive manner. although mto <dig> had lesser metabolite correlations as compared to the other  <dig> genotypes, characteristic correlations were found only in mto <dig>  e.g., linolenate -steroids, linolenate -nicotianamine, and glutamate-glutamine. the correlations specific to tt <dig> were also observed, such as malate-aromatic amino acids .

the correlations obtained in each genotype were filtered by the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient, and these significant pairs were compared among the  <dig> genotypes . the correlation profile of mto <dig> differed largely from those of the remaining  <dig> genotypes. approximately  <dig> % of the significant correlation pairs were common among wt, mto <dig>  and tt4;  <dig> %  of the pairs in wt were conserved in tt4; only  <dig> %  of the pairs were conserved between wt and mto <dig>  these results suggested that the deregulated overproduction of methionine in mto <dig> strongly affected the stability of the cellular metabolite network, whereas the lack of flavonoids in tt <dig> resulted in the strengthening of metabolite correlation networks.

malate and aromatic compounds in shikimate pathways are tightly coregulated in tt4
among the metabolite correlation pairs significant in tt <dig>  malate and sinapate exhibited a much tighter correlation  than did wt  and mto <dig>  although these  <dig> metabolites are located at a distance in the metabolic map. table  <dig> shows the correlation of malate or sinapate with the other metabolites belonging to the tca cycle and shikimate pathways. malate- citrate and malate- fumarate, which are components in the tca cycle, exhibited significant correlations both in wt and tt <dig>  on the other hand, malate and the aromatic compounds in the shikimate pathway  were correlated only in tt <dig> but not in wt  although the levels of these metabolites in tt <dig> were maintained at levels similar to those observed in wt . among the compounds concerned with these unique correlations enforced in tt <dig>  malate and sinapate are believed to be direct precursors for the formation of sinapoylmalate acting as a uv-b protectant  <cit> . interestingly, the level of sinapoylmalate itself did not change in tt <dig> as compared with that in wt . these results suggested that the correlations between malate- aromatic compounds were intensified in tt <dig> without any significant changes in the pools of metabolites concerned . the tight correlation between malate and sinapate may imply a connection with the role of sinapoylmalate against uv-b stress in the tt <dig> mutant, in which the uv-protective flavonoids are missing .

boldface characters represent the unique correlations observed only in tt <dig>  the unique correlations in tt <dig> are defined as rmet >  <dig>  in tt <dig> and as rmet <  <dig>  in wt and mto <dig>  abbreviations: tca, tricarboxylic acid.

few metabolite correlations are conserved among wt, mto <dig>  and tt <dig> mutants
the significant level of the metabolite correlation was set at p <  <dig> . only pairs comprising identified metabolites are listed. the metabolites were defined as those identified on comparison with mass spectra and retention indices  from the library databases  and with authentic standards. abbreviations: glycerol-3-p, glycerol-3-phosphate; inositol-1-p, myo-inositol-1-phosphate; adenosine-5-p, adenosine-5-monophosphate.

a new score for metabolites can select metabolomic markers of a mutant
in order to represent the metabolic characters of plants with different genotypes particularly in terms of metabolite correlation besides simple comparison of changes in metabolite levels, a new index for a metabolite representing the change of metabolite correlation was necessary. we therefore defined a new scoring method for metabolites that represents a diverse correlation in a genotype. this new criterion "z- score of metabolite correlation " represents the extent of uniqueness over given genotypes in terms of metabolite correlation, i.e., if metabolite correlation coefficient of metabolite x in a given genotype decreases markedly as compared to those in other genotypes, the zmc of x in this genotype increases.

as shown in table  <dig>  zmcs adequately delineated the key metabolites of each genotype. in mto <dig>  methionine and methionine sulfone exhibited positive zmcs as expected from their accumulation data. spermidine showed a positive zmc, suggesting that polyamine metabolism was affected in mto <dig>  interestingly, linoleate, linolenate, and ethanolamine showed negative zmcs, indicating that the overall correlations of these metabolites were enhanced in mto <dig>  since these  <dig> metabolites are involved in glycerolipid biosynthesis, the network reconfiguration of the lipid metabolism may take place following methionine overaccumulation in mto <dig>  in tt <dig>  the sugar disaccharide exhibited a strongly positive zmc, suggesting perturbation of sugar metabolism in tt <dig> as speculated from the slight changes in sugar-related metabolite levels. a number of metabolites extracted by zmc were those annotated only by msts without identification. these metabolites are interesting for further characterization in order to understand the mechanism of network regulation in depth.

abbreviations: ri, retention index; mst, mass spectral tag obtained from the golm metabolome database   <cit> ; pr-mst, platform for riken metabolome -mass spectral tag defined by our custom library for gc-ms spectra at prime.

it should also be noted that the simple comparison of these metabolite levels listed by zmc did not show significant differences except in the case of methionine and methionine sulfone. thus, combinatory analyses of metabolite levels and metabolite correlation, such as zmc, are important to obtain a clear insight into the manner in which the system is regulated and to generate a new hypothesis for characterizing metabolic systems in plants with different genotypes.

projection of metabolite correlation to gene-expression correlation gives clues on how metabolic networks are regulated
since the conserved metabolite correlations across the different genotypes are presumed to characterize fundamental networks regardless of mutations, the investigation of gene expression in the metabolism of these metabolite pairs may lead to deeper insight into network regulation. the nature of metabolic networks represented as metabolite correlation might be explained, at least partly, by the correlation of gene expressions, and new findings regarding the gene-expression network could be obtained from the correlations of conserved metabolite.

discussion
single deregulation of methionine synthesis disturbs the entire primary metabolism
for mto <dig>  a significant increase in the level of homocysteine, methionine, and s-adenosyl-methionine was observed as expected from the overaccumulation of methionine; unexpectedly, there was a significant decrease in the levels of pipecolate and uracil . pipecolate is known to be a component of the lysine degradation pathway in a variety of organisms including mammals, fungi, and plants  <cit> . uracil is derived from the aspartic acid family connected to methionine. in addition, there was a significant increase in the levels of arginine and ornithine. arginine and ornithine belong to the glutamate family and are precursors of putrescine, which is an important metabolite in polyamine biosynthesis  <cit> . the results of zmc analysis also indicated spermidine as an index metabolite of mto <dig>  these data suggest that the overaccumulation of methionine affects not only methionine metabolism but also the regulation of the glutamate family leading to the regulation of polyamines. with regard to the correlations of metabolites belonging to the aspartate, glutamate, and polyamine biosynthetic pathways, most of the metabolites were highly conserved in both wt and tt <dig> but not in mto <dig>  these results indicate that the perturbation in methionine metabolism causes a strong impact and a reconfiguration in the cellular nitrogen status by finely adjusting the metabolic networks of the nitrogenous metabolites.

backup system is reconfigured for protection against uv stress in the tt <dig> mutant
the metabolite pairs of the malate- shikimate pathways, in particular, the malate- sinapate pair, exhibited enhanced correlations in tt <dig> although the levels of these compounds remain unchanged . sinapoylmalate, a major metabolite of sinapoylesters, is believed to play a protective role against uv-b in arabidopsis  <cit> . the correlation observed between malate and sinapate in tt <dig>  which is not observed in wt, implies the reconfiguration of metabolic networks lacking flavonoids in tt <dig> to efficiently produce an alternative defense compound, sinapoylmalate, thereby replacing the uv-protectant flavonoids. it is worthwhile to note that this correlation was observed even under normal conditions of light, in which no elevated accumulations of sinapoylmalate and its precursors were observed; this suggests the presence of a yet unidentified mechanism of cellular preparation for an adaptive response to uv stress by the reconfiguration of the metabolite networks in arabidopsis. when we performed the uv-b stress experiment on wt and tt <dig>  the levels of sinapoylmalate and sinapoylglucose were increased more in tt <dig> than in wt under uv irradiation . more detailed statistical and correlation analyses for sinapoylmalate, sinapoylglucose, and other aromatic compounds are in progress.

a novel strategy for the prediction of genes responsible for metabolic networks by combined correlation analysis of metabolite accumulation and gene expression
there are a few reports available in literature concerning the correlations of metabolite accumulation, enzyme activities, and gene expression. the metabolite correlation, mainly in primary metabolites, is presumed to represent the direct and indirect interconnections in the metabolic pathway, even in the absence of causality between the correlation profiles and the pathway  <cit> . non-synchronized patterns of transcripts and enzymes have been observed in wt and the starch-free mutant of arabidopsis  <cit> . the significant metabolite-to-gene correlation is likely to reflect the effects of metabolic regulation that occur from metabolites to gene expression, rather than those from gene expression to metabolites  <cit> . the origin of high metabolite correlation is suggested to be derived either from the strong control of a single common enzyme between metabolites or from the increase in the level of a single enzyme as compared to the others  <cit> .

several studies indicate the power of integrated analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome  <cit> , in particular, the feasibility of coexpression analysis by public transcriptome datasets  <cit> , for gene characterization. thus, we conceived that the basis of metabolic networks conserved across plants of different genotypes can be explained, at least partly, by the correlation of gene expression, and a better understanding of gene function can be obtained in the context of metabolic networks.

when we searched for the coexpression of enzyme-coding genes directly connected to metabolite pairs whose correlation is conserved, only a small fraction of genes were coexpressed. nevertheless, we could filter the coexpressed enzyme-coding gene pairs  that are presumably important for the regulation of metabolic networks. with regard to the serine-glutamate pair, serine hydroxymethyltransferase  <dig>   showed a strong correlation with glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase  <dig>  . both enzymes are involved in the photorespiration/metabolic salvage pathway, suggesting a coordinate regulation of this pathway at both the gene expression and metabolite levels. in addition, a number of genes of unknown function are also listed. it is intriguing to deduce the function of these genes by accounting for their correlation with metabolite pairs by further study.

furthermore, we extended the coexpression analysis to the transcription-factor genes with the enzyme-coding genes . this search extracted constants-like <dig>   and  <dig> unknown transcription factor genes  from the metabolite pair of serine-glutamate. col <dig> was previously identified as a constitutive photomorphogenetic  <dig> -interacting protein and was suggested to be a positive regulator of light signaling  <cit> . three unknown genes exhibited many connections with several enzyme-coding genes  involved in photorespiration/metabolic salvage pathway and nitrate assimilation. these unknown transcription-factor genes are of interest for further characterization because these may play an important role in the metabolic network of serine-glutamate. in addition to the serine-glutamate pairs, the other metabolite correlation pairs led to the suggestion of several transcription-factor genes through enzyme-coding gene coexpression in the same manner. this strategy can be a novel way of delimiting genes involved in metabolic networks.

CONCLUSIONS
metabolite profiling and subsequent metabolomic network analysis have been carried out for a. thaliana wild-type and  <dig> metabolic mutants – mto <dig> and tt <dig> – with the following conclusions.

 <dig>  we have established a widely applicable metabolome analysis pipeline adopting gc-tof/ms with an h-mcr deconvolution method followed by metabolite annotation/identification, comparison of metabolite levels, and metabolite correlation analysis. for the metabolite correlation analysis, we proposed a new scoring method called zmc to extract "index metabolites" representing the metabolome of a given genotype.

 <dig>  the overaccumulation of methionine affected not only the methionine-related and polyamine metabolisms but also the overall metabolic regulation in terms of metabolite levels and correlation networks.

 <dig>  flavonoid-free mutation in tt <dig> had a small impact on the overall metabolic regulation. however, the malate-sinapate correlation strongly intensified, indicating a mechanism of metabolic reconfiguration to prepare a uv response in the absence of flavonoids.

 <dig>  by coexpression analysis based on metabolite correlations conserved across the  <dig> genotypes, genes that are likely involved in the cellular regulation of metabolic networks have been delimited.
