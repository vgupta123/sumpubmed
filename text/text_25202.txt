BACKGROUND
current hybridization technologies allow assaying thousands of nucleic acid sequences in a single reaction on a solid substrate. such massively parallel systems offer unprecedented opportunities for basic research and diagnostic applications, including gene sequencing  <cit> , detection of genetic polymorphisms  <cit> , genome-composition analysis  <cit>  and measurement of gene expression profiles in prokaryotes  <cit>  or cancer cells  <cit> . oligonucleotide probes  offer more flexibility than cdna probes since they can be tailored according to optimal in silico physico-chemical and specificity properties, and applied to any sequence data.

early available probe design software identified sets of probes sharing homogeneous thermodynamic properties for probe-target hybridization  <cit> . more elaborated software tools include cross-homology testing of probes against a reference database by blast   <cit>  or prediction of secondary structures into the thermodynamically-based approach   <cit> . a frequent drawback of some of these algorithms is to yield an excessive number of unprocessed blast outputs that complicates final selection of the most specific probes. furthermore, these approaches do not take into consideration probe interaction with microarray surface, in particular the impact of mismatches position between the target and probes, as shown by hughes et al  <cit> . designing reliable oligonucleotide probes with available software is quite difficult for bacterial genomes with low gc content  <cit> , low complexity in sequence composition, or frequent conserved repeats leading to erroneous target identification by cross-hybridization.

the reported method  implements an algorithm for filtering oligonucleotide probes libraries sharing homogeneous thermodynamic properties by using positional information of predicted target-probe binding regions. an additional characteristic of olicheck is to annotate probes recognizing highly conserved targets shared by different genomes. staphylococcus aureus  was selected as a model organism for implementing and experimentally validating this approach. the choice of this clinically important pathogen for fundamental and applied genomic studies is prompted by the availability of several fully or partially sequenced strain genomes  <cit> . a set of feature elements was designed by olicheck to yield an extensive s. aureus genome coverage. this s. aureus specific probe set together with control probes were used to manufacture an oligoarray that was extensively validated for comparative genomics, molecular epidemiology, mapping of deletion mutations, and transcription profiling applications. the specificity, signal-response linearity, and influence of hybridization temperatures for transcript profiling are also described. further genomic oligoarrays of several distinct microbial species have been successfully designed using this generic methodological approach.

RESULTS
design of a s. aureus oligoarray
the major genomic component of s. aureus is a  <dig>  million base pairs  circular chromosome with a low gc content  which represents  <dig>  orfs in strain n <dig>  the median length of strain n <dig> orfs is  <dig> bp and the 25th–75th percentile ranges from 444- <dig>  bp  <cit> . a probe design software  generated a comprehensive list of candidate 40– <dig> mer probes for each orf of strain n <dig> according to the preset thermodynamic hybridization parameters . a similar process was performed with strain mu <dig> and col. this step yielded  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  candidate probes for strains n <dig>  mu <dig> and col, respectively.

further selection of candidate oligonucleotides to sort out cross-reactive probes within the genome of each strain was achieved by olicheck. this specificity filtering test is a mathematical transposition of hughes et al observations  <cit>  on the impact of mismatches position between the target and probe with respect to the microarray surface. the occurrence of mismatch in the distal portion  of the probe leads to a strong decrease in signal intensity, as opposed to the proximal portion . the results of the specificity filtering test, when performed separately on each strain, yielded a list of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  probes for n <dig>  mu <dig> and col, respectively . in contrast to olicheck-filtered probes that are expected to be devoid of cross-hybridization, >85% of the probes selected by arraydesigner™ alone displayed significant cross-hybridization with multiple orfs.

for each strain, all accepted probes were further annotated by olicheck against heterologous s. aureus genomes to identify probes common to the different genomes .

to fulfill the manufacturing requirements of a s. aureus genome-wide oligoarray, a further probe selection was performed. this selection used a spreadsheet program to rank probes according to optimal strain coverage and thermodynamic criteria, for providing one or more non-overlapping probes per target orf .

in silico properties of the s. aureus oligoarray and manufacturing of staphchip
the final set of  <dig>  s. aureus olicheck-filtered probes recognized  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of n <dig>  mu <dig>  and col orfs, respectively. the low residual percentage of orfs  that escaped recognition by our final probe set mostly included  mobile genetic elements, located either on prophage or transposon elements. a likely explanation for exclusion of these targets by olicheck is the occurrence of highly homologous  sequence repeats found in other orfs. accordingly,  <dig> residual probes covering these orfs had to be selected relying on step a  only.

to manufacture staphchip, a total of  <dig>  s. aureus probes were synthesized on the array together with a subset of control probes designed by olicheck against e. coli k <dig> genome  <cit>  .

comparison of olicheck with a currently used method
to validate the properties of olicheck by comparison with an established method, we generated 60-mer oligonucleotides probes with homogenous thermodynamic criteria for n <dig> genome by the recently published arrayoligoselector  <cit>  tool. the final set of probes generated according to the arrayoligoselector procedure  <cit>   was further tested for cross-homology by using olicheck. a large percentage of these probes  were sorted out by olicheck because they failed specificity criteria defined by hughes et al  <cit> .

comparison of in silico-predicted with experimentally detected hybridization signals
among the total number of  <dig>  s. aureus probes,  <dig>   recognized targets common to all three strains , thus affording staphchip valuable properties for comparative genomic and transcriptomic studies on s. aureus. the finding of a significant number of probes  commonly identified in n <dig> and mu <dig> but not col may be explained by their closely-related genomic contents  <cit> .

the number of probes predicted to detect genomic elements from each s. aureus strain was compared to those experimentally recorded using staphchip . for each strain, > <dig> % of the in silico-predicted hybridization signals were indeed detected by hybridization of genomic dna on staphchip probes. most of the false-positive signals were recorded on probes that were generated using arraydesigner™ only . in silico analysis determined that these false-positive signals did not originate from recognition of intergenic regions . thus, such false-positive frequency is not transferable to the whole array.

use of staphchip for deletion mapping and genomotyping applications
to evaluate the accuracy of staphchip for deletion mapping, the cy- <dig> labelled dna from the sa113ica deletion mutant   <cit>  was competitively hybridized with the cy- <dig> labelled dna from its isogenic parent. figure  <dig> maps the ica-related signals which are missing in the ica mutant, as opposed to the unique positive signal generated by the tetracycline resistance marker used for the construction and selection of strain sa113ica. fluorescent intensities of all other signals except ica-related genes were equivalent for both strains.

the potential of staphchip for epidemiological typing was analysed by comparative genomic hybridization  of s. aureus strains from various epidemiological origins. genomic dna from each individual s. aureus strain labelled with cy <dig> was co-hybridized with equivalent amounts of cy5-labelled control genomic dna  and analyzed by two-way hierarchical clustering .

the recently sequenced community-acquired mrsa strain mw <dig>  <cit> , not included in staphchip probe design, revealed important differences with strains n <dig>  mu <dig>  and col, as shown by a major yellow region on figure  <dig>  the set of probes yielding negative signals with mw <dig> dna  corresponds to orfs coding for antibiotic and heavy metal resistance determinants, bacterial adhesins and dna modification enzymes lacking in this epidemic strain  <cit> . in contrast, extensively conserved genomic regions  are composed of house-keeping genes contributing to cell-wall, dna synthesis, as well as essential metabolic enzymes.

further analysis of strain sa <dig> and sa113ica compared to the other strains, showed no hybridization signals  for a number of genes  known to be missing in pathogenicity islands i-ii-iii of the nctc <dig> family  <cit> .

application of staphchip for expression profiling studies
control experiments were performed to study the dose-response of labelled cdna and influence of hybridization temperature on the linearity and intensities of fluorescent signals. two portions of n <dig> cdna were labelled during reverse-transcription, with either cy- <dig> or cy- <dig> and competitively hybridized on staphchip. characteristics of fluorescent signals obtained on n <dig> specific probes were compared to those recorded on control e. coli oligonucleotide probes, at either  <dig> or 60°c. the median level of fluorescence intensities were approximately 5– <dig> fold higher for s. aureus probes compared to e. coli probes.

on s. aureus capture elements, log-transformed signal intensities recorded with equivalent input amounts  of cy- <dig> and cy- <dig> cdna were highly correlated . linear regression of cy- <dig> versus cy- <dig> scatter plots yielded slopes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at  <dig> or 60°c . when  <dig> μg of cy- <dig> was competitively hybridized with  <dig> μg of cy- <dig> labelled cdna, slopes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were recorded at  <dig> or 60°c, as expected . since log-transformed signal intensities remained highly correlated , this assessed the robustness of the recorded signals. furthermore, the median intensity of fluorescent signals was marginally altered by temperature changes .

in contrast, signal intensities from e. coli control probes were highly disturbed by temperature changes or by altering the ratios of fluorescently-labelled s. aureus cdna . furthermore, the median intensity of fluorescent signals decreased by > <dig> fold at  <dig> compared to 55°c . dye-swap experiments yielded equivalent results .

reproducibility of staphchip for expression profiling
to evaluate the reproducibility of fluorescent signals , eight independent hybridization experiments were performed under identical conditions using cy- <dig> labelled n <dig> cdna, derived from overnight cultures. maximal relative errors  of fluorescent probe signal intensities were more widely scattered on e. coli  compared to s. aureus  capture elements, thus reflecting the instability of poorly specific interactions with s. aureus targets and e. coli probes. the 90th percentile of maximal relative errors from s. aureus probes represented <25% of average signal intensities. in contrast, the same percentile of maximal relative errors recorded from e. coli probes represented >100% of average signal intensities. furthermore, the 50th percentile on e. coli probes was superior to the 90th percentile of maximal relative errors on s. aureus probes.

finally, we compared signal intensities generated from individual gene transcripts covered by two or more adjacent but non-overlapping s. aureus probes. figure  <dig> shows average fluorescence intensities and their maximal relative errors  and the cumulative distribution of maximal relative errors  for nearly 90% of the gene transcripts , maximal relative errors of orf-related signals were <60%. this yields evidence that multiple probes recognizing the same transcripts provide reproducible signals and that staphchip provides reliable and robust determinations of genome-wide transcripts.

discussion
several recent studies have shown the usefulness of microarrays for genomic and global transcriptomic studies of microbial pathogens  <cit> . each step of microarray experiments needs to be optimized and validated, from array design and manufacture to data collection and analysis. among critical technical parameters that need to be controlled are microarray surface chemistry, probe sequence, probe deposition process, and hybridization conditions. accuracy of microarray-generated data can be improved by using multiple replicates, dye swaps and statistical data analysis. compared to cdna microarrays, oligoarrays provide a flexible design and are considered more reliable in terms of sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . reported drawbacks of cdna or pcr probes include: i) unpredicted secondary structures, ii) uncontrolled cross-hybridization occurring on repeats or partially homologous regions of pcr probes, and iii) varying amounts and purity of spotted products  <cit> . recent software development allows genome-wide selection of sub-sequences that uniquely identify genes. ideally, these approaches should amplify fragments of constant length, thus minimizing the differences in pcr amplification efficiency as well as in hybridization kinetics  <cit> . however, the extent of cross-hybridization has rarely been evaluated and reported, and thus may lead to severe errors in higher level data analysis, such as clustering  <cit> , genome composition analysis and genotyping for molecular epidemiology  <cit> .

most oligoarray applications dedicated to prokaryotes were developed by companies using proprietary algorithms  <cit>  whose detailed properties are rarely available. furthermore, the lack of published validation data prevents adequate comparison of those short-probe oligoarrays with investigator-designed oligonucleotide arrays.

to date, several strategies for oligoarray design have been described, but their experimental validation is often limited   <cit>  or absent  <cit> . a drawback of these approaches is to apply thermodynamics laws on probe/target interaction as determined in solution  <cit> , but ignoring effects related to oligonucleotide immobilization on a microarray surface  <cit> .

to address this issue, olicheck considered the influence of predicted probe/target binding with respect to its position along the immobilized probe, as demonstrated by hughes et al  <cit> . this tool allowed selecting probes from large oligonucleotide libraries in order to provide multiple genome coverage, suitable for epidemiological and transcriptomic studies.

as a specific application, olicheck was used to design staphchip, an oligoarray dedicated to genomic studies on s. aureus, a clinically important pathogen with a low gc content and numerous sequence repeats. the  <dig>  feature elements were selected to ideally cover all orfs of three s. aureus genomes with two non-overlapping probes, as validated under experimental conditions. a particular achievement of this strategy is to yield cross-annotations between the designed probes and homologous orf regions conserved across several genomes. any new genome sequence can be screened by olicheck to identify probes that can specifically detect homologous orfs. cross-annotations on the recently released s. aureus mw <dig> genome  <cit>  yielded 78% gene coverage. it should be mentioned that the recently published s. aureus col genome  <cit>  composition and annotation have changed significantly since the early release by tigr in  <dig> 

the properties of staphchip design were confirmed by comparative genome hybridization and global gene expression studies. work in progress assesses the reliability of staphchip for monitoring s. aureus transcription changes during biofilm formation, endocytic stage, or expression of antibiotic resistance. another achievement  was the design of oligonucleotide probes for the genomes of neisseria meningitidis a and b, e. coli k <dig>  erwinia carotovora and e. chrysanthemi; having gc contents ranging from  <dig>  to 52%. furthermore, olicheck design expands oligoarray use for the study of host-pathogen interactions by potentially preventing cross-hybridization between bacterial probes and contaminating host nucleic acids.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this work describes a validated approach to select optimal oligoarray capture elements for s. aureus expression analysis and comparative genome hybridization studies. this generic approach will enable researchers to develop customized oligoarrays for genomic studies of any sequenced microorganism.
