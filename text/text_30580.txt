BACKGROUND
biofuels have been proposed as alternatives to relieve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and energy shortages  <cit> . the increasing demand for lignocellulosic biomass for the production of biofuels make it necessary to exploit fast-growing and high-yield wood resources. thus, it is of great importance to understand the underlying mechanism of growth especially in height, which is highly correlated with biomass yield, for lignocellulose-abundant plants. as one of the fastest growing lignocellulose-abundant plants on earth, bamboos can reach their final height of 5–20 m in a single growing season of 2–4 months due to the expansion of individual internodes already present in the buds  <cit> . to better understand the growth characteristics and physical properties of these bamboos, numerous studies have focused on the general mode of growth, anatomical structure, hormone distributions and chemical and physical characteristics of the culms  <cit> , and have observed sequentially elongated internodes from the base to the top  <cit> . some internode elongation-associated genes such as aco <dig>  cenl <dig>  eui <dig>  osglu <dig>  snorkel and ssd <dig> have been identified in other plants of gramineae  <cit> , whereas limited molecular information has been provided in the subfamily of bamboos. despite the sequencing of a set of cdna  <cit> , expressed sequence tags   <cit> , protein expression profiles  <cit> , draft genome  <cit>  , rna-seq  <cit>  and monoclonal antibody banks  <cit>  in bamboo, the molecular processes underlying rapid internode elongation remain unclear.

measurements of mrna and mirna expression levels, clarity of the regulatory relationships between mirnas and their corresponding mrna targets are critical to understanding many pathways and biological systems. with the advent of second-generation sequencing-based technologies such as rna-seq and digital gene expression , it is possible to measure a genome-wide dynamic range of expression in an unbiased manner. these technologies have a high sensitivity and reproducibility compared with existing technologies   <cit> , and will undoubtedly lead to novel insights into plant development and biotic and abiotic stress responses.

to comprehensively understand the molecular processes underlying the rapidly internode elongation of phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens at the whole genome level, we have studied the differently expressed proteins in different development stages using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  technology  <cit> , here, we performed rna-seq, global mrna and mirna expression profiling on four different developmental stages and three different internodes. in addition to gaining more insight into the unique growth characteristics of bamboo, we provide a good case study to analyze gene expression of non-model plant species using high-throughput short-read sequencing. and also, the correlation and concordance of transcript and post-transcriptional levels, protein and transcript levels will be studied to explain complex dynamic development processes in the rapid growth of developing culms in moso bamboo.

RESULTS
anatomical and endogenous hormone variation at different developmental stages of internodes
to better understand the anatomical structure of the culms, transverse and longitudinal sections of culms from the defined development stages were observed under a microscope. four developmental stages or three developmental internodes were defined according to the different unearthed heights of individual plants  or different portions  of the same culm , respectively. the number of nuclei declined with culm development , and almost disappeared in the later stages . meanwhile, the length of parenchyma and fiber cells increased continuously with advancing development. comparison of transverse and longitudinal sections of three developing internodes  in the same developmental stage  indicated that the number of nuclei in the tissue increased continuously from basal to apical internodes, while cell length showed the opposite trend . internode elongation is usually correlated with cell division and elongation. the gradually elongated cell length and gradually decreasing numbers of cell nuclei showed that cell division and elongation occurred simultaneously and thus affecting internode elongation: the former was predominant at initial stages, with the latter predominant at late stages. thus, the culm showed sequential development from basal to apical internodes throughout the growth period.

the dynamic changes in indole-3-acetic acid , gibberellic acid , abscisic acid  and cytokinin zeatin riboside  concentrations in four different developmental stages all displayed a unimodal type. the concentration of iaa, ga <dig> and zr initially gradually increased and then gradually decreased after the g3m stage. in contrast, the aba concentration decreased initially and then gradually increased after the g2m stage. however, the changes of ga <dig>  zr and aba concentrations in three different developmental internodes were basically inconsistent with the above mentioned results, unlike iaa . substantial changes in cellular activities and hormone levels involved in these growth stages prompted us to investigate the molecular processes at the transcriptome level.

analysis of transcriptome sequencing
trinity assembly of paired-end sequencing reads
rna of different types of culms  was pooled to provide a broad gene library associated with internode elongation. a total of  <dig>  million reads with length of 180 bp were obtained in the transcriptome sequencing and  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 259 bp were obtained. through trinity assembly, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 612 bp and a total length of  <dig>  mbp. of these, we gained  <dig>  unigenes  with length 200–900 bp,  <dig> unigenes  with length 1000–2000 bp, and  <dig> unigenes  with length > 2000 bp . sequencing reads were realigned to the unigenes using trinity  <cit> , allowing up to 2 bp mismatches: about  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> % of the unigenes were realigned by more than  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> reads, respectively .

functional classification by gene ontology  and cluster of orthologous groups 
out of  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   showed significant similarity to known proteins in the nr database and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. however,  <dig>   had blast hits in the swiss-prot database and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. altogether, a total of  <dig>  unique protein accessions were identified in blast searches. this indicated that our study produced a large fraction of moso bamboo genes. analysis of  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes using blastx and estscan software revealed that about  <dig>  had reliable coding sequences, and the length of most was >  <dig> aa when translated into proteins. comparison with the nr and swiss-prot databases revealed that  <dig>  unigenes had good comparability with known gene sequences in existing species.

assignment of go terms to  <dig>  unigenes revealed  <dig>  functional terms. of them, assignments to the cellular component were the majority , followed by biological processes  and molecular function . under the cellular component category, cell  and organelles  were notably represented. under the category of biological processes, cellular processes  and metabolic processes  were the majority. in the molecular function category,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were linked to binding and catalytic activity, respectively; it is worthy of mention that a few genes were assigned to nutrient reservoir activity, metallochaperone activity, channel regulator activity and protein tag . these indicated that some important cell activities, biological, cellular and metabolic processes occurred in culms of developing moso bamboo shoot.

of  <dig>  nr hits,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to the cog classifications. of all  <dig> cog categories, the largest group was the cluster for general function prediction only ; followed by transcription ; replication, recombination and repair ; posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones ; signal transduction mechanisms ; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis ; and carbohydrate transport and metabolism . only a few unigenes were assigned to nuclear structure and extracellular structure. furthermore,  <dig> sequences were assigned to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism .

functional classification by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
the kegg pathway database can help to further determine biological functions and interactions of genes. based on a comparison against the kegg database using blastx with e < 10– <dig>  of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   had significant matches and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . among them,  <dig>   unigenes with enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to the metabolic pathways group. of the unigenes,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were linked to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, endocytosis, rna transport and glycerophospholipid metabolism, respectively.

digital gene expression  analysis in rapidly growing culms of bamboo
tag identification and quantification
a total of  <dig>  million raw tags of the mrnas extracted from moso bamboo culms were identified by base calling  <cit> . approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million high quality non-redundant clean tags were obtained in g1m–g4m, g3t and g3b groups , respectively. gene annotation was performed by tag mapping analysis using the  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes from rna-seq-based transcriptome analysis as the reference transcript database. results showed that  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of all distinct tags within different group could be mapped to the entire reference database , respectively . the detected sense and anti-sense strands, sense or anti-sense strands mapped by the tags among groups were different . among the detectable expressed unigenes,  <dig>  had successful annotations.

depth of sampling
saturation analysis can be used to check whether the number of detected genes continues to increase when sequencing amount  increases. when the sequencing amount reached 4 m, the number of detected genes almost ceased increasing  in g1m–g4m, g3t and g3b libraries.

comparison of gene expression level between libraries
the differences in tag frequencies in the g1m–g4m, g3t and g3b libraries were used to estimate gene expression levels at different development stages or different internodes. the black and white histograms represent transcripts up-regulated or down-regulated in number by more than twofold in every library, respectively. for developmental stages, the highest amount of differential genes  was detected between g1m and g3m, and the least  between g1m and g2m. for developmental positions, the highest were observed between g3t and g3b , followed by g3m vs g3b , and g3t vs g3m . the number of down-regulated genes was more than that of up-regulated genes with the exception of g4m vs g3m . moreover,  <dig> genes that met our threshold criteria for at least one of the  <dig> dge comparisons were clustered using principal coordinate analysis  and hierarchical clustering. six samples were separated into two groups, one was g1m, g2m and g3t group, and another was g3m, g4m and g3b group . the result was consistent with that of hierarchical clustering .

expression profiles of mrnas during culms development
the  <dig>  genes were further clustered using short time-series expression miner   <cit> . it identified  <dig>  or  <dig>  significant gene profiles  in development or internode, respectively .

the development-specific gene clusters, stem profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig>  showed respectively down and up regulated along with the culm development and consistent with the decrease of cell nuclei number and prolong of cell length  along with clum development and aging. stem profile  <dig>  and  <dig>  have a reversal in the trend of expression change between development and aging, and profile  <dig> was consistent with the change of aba content. profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig>  gene clusters have a reversal in g2m stage and no change at later stage, while profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig>  gene clusters have a reversal in g3m stage and no change at earlier stage. profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig>  show up- or down-regulated during the middle stage, and no change at the earlier and later stages. contrary to profile  <dig> and  <dig>  profile  <dig> contained  <dig> genes .

the internode-specific gene clusters, profile  <dig>  and  <dig>  represented down-regulated genes, were consistent with the decrease of cell nuclei  along with internode development. profile  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , up-regulation internode-specific genes, were consistent with the prolong of cell length  along with internode development .

mirnas regulate expression changes in rapidly growing culms of bamboo
sequencing and data analysis
to investigate the mirna component of small rnas and the dynamic changes of the mirnas during the rapid growth of developing culms in moso bamboo, we purified the culms of g1m-g4m, g3t and g3b from bamboo and sequenced their small rnas using solexa high-throughput technology. after removing sequences of low quality, 5′ adaptor contaminants, 3′ adaptor null, insert null, poly a and rnas smaller than 18nt, we obtained  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads, respectively . these high-quality small rnas were used for further analysis.

of the millions of high-quality small rnas from the individual libraries,  <dig> – <dig> % was  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length, which is the typical size range for dicer-derived products. the major component of small rnas in all libraries was  <dig> nucleotides long. throughout clum development, the proportion of 24-nucleotide small rnas decreased and the 21-nucleotide population increased in g1m-g4m, while g3m contained mostly 21-nucleotide small rnas .

prediction of novel mirna and comparison of mirna expression level between libraries
in total, we obtained  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> predicted novel mirnas. of these novel mirnas,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  were expressed in g1m-g4m, and  <dig> in g3t,  <dig> in g3b, respectively . differ from the result of differentially expressed genes; the number of differential mirnas in the initial stages was more than that in the descendent stages, the amount of up-regulated mirnas was more than that of down-regulated mirnas with the exception of g1m vs g2m . however, pca and hierarchical clustering showed the consistency between mirnas  and mrnas , that is, six samples were separated into two groups, one was g1m, g2m and g3t group, another was g3m, g4m and g3b group, just as protein  clustering result . furthermore, compared with mirna expression, higher consistency between mrnas and proteins was observed.

expression profiles of mirnas during culms development
to directly compare the expression patterns of these mirnas in the different development stages or internodes, four development-specific profiles  or one internode-specific profile  were identified significantly by stem cluster, respectively . profile  <dig>  and  <dig>  continue the development trend. profile  <dig>  and  <dig>  have a reversal in the trend of expression change between development . the internode-specific significant mirnas cluster, profile  <dig>  contained  <dig> mirnas .

the integrated analysis between stem and positive/negative correlation
in general, the mature mirna negatively regulates their target mrnas by either translational repression or mrna degradation <cit> . through target prediction using the miranda web service, we found  <dig> targets for  <dig> known-mirnas and  <dig> targets for  <dig> novel-mirnas . analysis to identify negative correlations between mirna and mrna expression was done using an in house r script, and pearson correlation coefficient  was computed for each mirna and their predicted target mrnas. forty-five of  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs combined by  <dig> unique mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas presented an anti-correlationship between the expression level of mirnas and mrnas  . positive correlation between 2-de staining intensity and gene expression levels determined by rna-seq for fast-growing clum in moso bamboo are summarized in additional file 12: table s <dig>  statistical pearson correlation ranged from  <dig> – <dig> , and eight of  <dig> mrna-protein pairs combined by  <dig> unique corresponding proteins presented a plus correlationship .

based on the analysis of intersection/integration between significant stem and positive/negative correlation, seventy three pairs were obtained, including  <dig> genes,  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> proteins. of the  <dig> pairs,  <dig> pairs  were significant correlation  . according to interaction of  <dig> genes and correlation between mirna-mrna and mrna-protein, a complex network was built in figure  <dig>  and the  <dig> genes were in the core position . the go annotation of  <dig> genes involved in grow and reproduction , auxin and aba mediated signaling, cellular process , metabolic process , biological regulation , and response to stimulus . the pathways included metabolism , genetic information processing , cellular processes , environmental information processing  and environmental adaptation  .

discussion
here, we report on the first next-generation sequencing study of the temporal and spatial mrna and mirna expression profiling of bamboo internodes. a dge approach enabled identifying those mechanisms related to rapid growth of developing culms in moso bamboo. stem, positive and negative correlation analysis were perfectly applied in integrated analysis of multi-omics data. these provided a molecular basis underlying the phenomenon of sequentially elongated internodes from the base to the top.

temporal and spatial growth patterns of internodes in moso bamboo
the initial, ascending, boosting and terminal stages are involved in growth phases in bamboo culms. sequentially elongated internodes from the base to the top in bamboo have been reported  <cit> . in our previous study, the growth stages of different internodes within the same culm were established using morphological observations, endogenous hormones and anatomical structure analysis  <cit> . however, the molecular basis underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. to determine transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation changes that occurred during different growth stages of bamboo culms, we analyzed six internodes from different stages  or different portions  of the same culm . it is generally recognized that different numbers of differentially expressed genes could represent or describe different growth degrees, i.e. the greater the number between stages, the larger the difference between them. comparisons of gene expression level between the six dge libraries indicated that the relationship between g1m and g2m was the closest and the farthest between g2m and g3m for four developmental stages. however, for the three spatial positions the relationship between g3t and g3b was the farthest, followed by g3m and g3b, and then g3t and g3m. in addition, pca and hierarchical clustering analysis based on differentially expressed genes showed that g1m, g2m and g3t were classified in the one group; whereas g3m, g4m and g3b were classified in another group, and cells of the latter were longer than the former. this was consistent with the clustering result from differentially expressed proteins and similar to differentially expressed mirnas, indicating the consistency in the differentially expressed levels of transcripts, mirnas and proteins among stages. all our data suggested that g1m, g2m and g3t were involved in the initial or ascending stages; and g3m, g4m and g3b were involved in the boosting or descendent stages. this result was not surprising, because although the whole plants were defined as a specific growth stage , different portions of the same plant may be at different stages resulting from the sequential basal–apical elongation of the culm internodes <cit> . when the growth of the whole plant was in boosting stage , the growth of the base internode  might be in descendent stage, while the top internode  might be in the initial or ascending stage. thus, our study provided a molecular basis underlying the phenomenon of sequentially elongated internodes from the base to the top.

go and pathways involved in rapidly elongating culms of p. heterocycla
short time-series expression data/experiments provide a wealth of information regarding the global view of the dynamic networks that are activated in dynamic biological processes  <cit> . many studies show that a comprehensive understanding of the control of gene expression will require quantitative information at all levels, from dna variants through to differential stability of the products or their regulative factors  <cit> . our temporal or static omics data, including transcriptome, post-transcriptome and translatome/proteome, play an even bigger part in molecular mechanisms study of dynamic bamboo’ culm development. by integrating such data with their positive/negative correlation analysis data sets we obtain the complete set of gene/protein or mirna that are activated, their dynamics and interactions, the role that different gene/protein or mirna have in the process and the differences in processes within and between different growth stages. at last the core genes focused on  <dig> genes and their correlative  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> proteins were obtained, the go and pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in response to stimulus, cell cycle, cellular component, regulation of plant hormone levels, many metabolism and signal transduction played major roles in persistently elongating culms of p. heterocycla. meanwhile, with the development of bamboo culm, gradually declined cell nuclei, gradually elongated parenchyma and fiber cells, dynamic changes of a unimodal-type endogenous hormones concentration were observed in our study. according to these, we proposed some scenarios involved in culm elongation . during the growth season, some environmental cues such as sufficient moisture, appropriate temperature, fertile soil and low light drive plant circadian rhythm, stimulate cell differentiation, division and growth, and biosynthesis of plant hormones, especially auxin and aba, through some signaling sensor and transduction pathways. furthermore, the cells take up energy or nutrients, possibly supplied by the mother bamboo rhizome and root system, in the cellular path through glycolysis, photorespiration, glycan and energy metabolism to maintain normal metabolic activity, which promotes cell division, elongation or death, lignin and cellulose deposition, eventually leading to growth of the culm.

stimulus response of an organism is usually due to some external condition or event. many genes/proteins involved in response to stimulus have been reported in the developing maize rachis  <cit>  and fruit development of sweet orange  <cit> . seventeen unigenes  involved in response to stimulus, such as carbohydrate, cytokinin, auxin or aba stimulus, cold, blue light, cadmium ion, gravitropism were detected during the fast-growing stage of bamboo, indicating the important role of environmental cues in bamboos’ rapid growth. signal transduction occurs when an extracellular signaling molecule activates a cell surface receptor. in turn, this receptor will alter intracellular molecules with a response. the hormone-mediated signaling pathway was one signal transduction found to be regulated in fast-growing culms of bamboo. it comprised auxin mediated signaling pathway  and abscisic acid mediated signaling pathway . the data indicated some genes in diverse hormone  signaling pathways are regulated in different trends or stages in rice seed development  <cit> . the phosphatidylinositol signaling system was also found to be regulated in fast-growing culms of bamboo. it comprised inositol or phosphatidylinositol kinase activity  and nucleoside-triphosphatase activity . some studies also illustrated that the phosphatidylinositol signaling system played an important role in plant development, such as storage root formation  <cit> , maize growth  <cit>  and rice seedling germination  <cit> . our study will help to expand knowledge of the function of the phosphatidylinositol signaling system in plant growth.

plant hormones are major regulators of plant growth and development. endogenous hormones as well as environmental factors can regulate progression through the cell cycle: shaping the plant and affecting seed growth, time of flowering, sex of flowers, and senescence of leaves and fruit  <cit> . auxins, the first identified plant hormones , are compounds that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. they affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. they stimulate the cambium  to divide, and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. some studies have shown that auxin promotes proliferation activities in the cambium during secondary growth. for example, it was indicated that auxin maxima are established and genes associated with auxin signaling are up-regulated in the actively proliferating cambial cells in hybrid aspen  <cit> . by contrast, general reduction in polar auxin transport and down-regulation of auxin signaling genes were observed during the phase of cambium dormancy  <cit> . consistently, disruption in auxin signaling/responsiveness led to detrimental effects on cambial activities, reducing secondary growth in hybrid aspen plants  <cit> . similarly, several other plant hormones, in particular cytokinin, ethylene and gibberellins are known to regulate cambial development  <cit> . in our studies, four major endogenous hormones  appeared to strongly influence the cell elongation phase. in the present study, four unigenes involved in auxin efflux and abscisic acid mediated signaling pathway, ethylene biosynthetic process, response to cytokinin stimulus, were identified . this indicates that in the bamboo growth season, environmental cues might stimulate cell division, growth or death through regulating hormone transport of influencing the expression of hormone response factors.

a cellular component may be an anatomical structure  or a gene product group . during secondary vascular development in poplar, the majority of the integral proteins identified were plasma membrane proteins  <cit> . some studies have suggested that up-regulation of plasma membrane aquaporins improves the photosynthetic activity and growth of eucalyptus trees  <cit> . in our study, numerous cell nuclei were found in parenchyma and fiber cells – an obvious sign of cell division – indicating the presence of meristematic tissue. as the culm developed, the number of nuclei declined, until there were almost no detectable nuclei during the late stages of development. meanwhile, the length of parenchyma and fiber cells increased continuously during development  <cit> . many genes involved with the plasma membrane , organelles  such as the nucleolus , organelle envelope , chloroplast thylakoid membrane , cell wall , and golgi membrane , cytosol  and apoplast  influenced the fast growth of the culm . most of them peaked at the ascending or boosting stages. this suggests that cell division is essential to rapid elongation of the culms during their early developmental stages. remarkably, six genes involving in biosynthesis of lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose, the major cell wall components, were detected, it suggests that lignocellulose is accumulated along with the development of bamboo’ culm.

metabolic processes are necessary for life. a number of excellent studies have indicated that metabolic processes were among the most regulated during developing stages of plants, and these genes were involved in many biological processes: e.g. glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and the metabolisms of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids and energy  <cit> . in developing bamboo culm in the present study, the dominant metabolic processes  included glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, the metabolisms of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, energy and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites . these metabolic processes can provide the energy and components for dna replication, signal transduction, cellular growth, hormone biosynthesis, cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, which are essential for the rapid culm elongation under conditions of light deficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exploration to characterize the temporal and spatial transcriptome, mirna and mrna expression profiling in a developing bamboo culm. we provided a molecular basis underlying the phenomenon of sequentially elongated internodes from the base to the top. several key pathways such as environmental adaptation, signal transduction, translation, transport and many metabolism, and go terms such as hormone-mediated signaling, cell growth, division and differentiation, primary shoot apical meristem specification, xylem and phloem pattern formation, protein modification, response to stimuli, metabolic process and biological regulation were identified as involved in rapid growth of bamboo culms. in addition to gaining more insight into the unique growth characteristics of bamboo, we provide a good case study to analyze mrna and mirna expression of a non-model plant species using high-throughput short-read sequencing. cluster concordance of protein, transcript and post-transcriptional levels are obvious. above all, we demonstrate that the integrated analysis of our multi-omics data, including transcriptome, post-transcriptome/mirnas and translatome/proteome, yield more complete representations and additional biological insights, especially the complex dynamic processes occurring in the rapid growth of developing culms in moso bamboo.
