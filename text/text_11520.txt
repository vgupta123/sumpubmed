BACKGROUND
chromatin is characterized by a dynamic multi-level organization passing through the nucleosomal basic unit, the 30-nm fiber, and higher-order folding up to the chromosome  <cit> . nucleosome remodeling, histone post-translational modifications , dna methylation, and other factors contribute to define different chromatin states which drive transcription and other chromatin-based nuclear processes  <cit> . in particular, hptms correlate largely with transcriptional regulation, but they are also involved in dna replication, histone deposition, and dna repair and recombination. hptms occurring in core histone tails include a variety of covalent modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination  <cit> . histone acetylation is a reversible process carried out by two classes of enzymes known as histone acetylases  and histone deacetylases  acting on the ε-amino group of lysine residues in histones. the acetylation targets in the h <dig> tail are lysine  residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and in h <dig> lysine  residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

hats and hdacs are classified into different families that are generally conserved in eukaryotes, including yeast, animals, and plants. plant hats are currently categorized into four groups on the basis of homology with other eukaryotic hats and domain composition:  hag with acetyltransf_ <dig> domain   include gcn5-, elp3-, hat1-like acetyltransferases;  ham with a myst  domain;  hac with similarity to p300/creb-binding protein;  haf related to the tata binding protein-associated factor  <dig>  <cit> . specific hats acetylate h4k <dig> , h4k <dig> and h3k <dig> . other acetylation marks, including h3k <dig>  are likely to result from the activities of hac members with broad specificity  <cit> . plant hdacs are grouped into three families: rdp3/hda <dig>  hereinafter named hdas, sir <dig> and hd <dig>  two of these families are homologous to hdacs found in yeast and animals while the hd <dig> family appears to be unique to plants and unrelated to the other families  <cit> . of all hptms, acetylation has the most potential to unfold chromatin since it neutralizes the basic charge of the lysine  <cit> . in the histones, hdacs remove acetyl groups added by hats by resetting the chromatin structure for the transcription. furthermore, hdacs and hats can function in protein complexes as transcriptional co-repressors and co-activators  <cit>  or associated with chromatin remodelers as modulators of the accessibility of dna to different machineries.

in arabidopsis, hdacs and hats are emerging as crucial players in growth and development processes, including meiotic recombination, embryogenesis, flowering, and senescence as well as in responses to environmental cues  <cit> . while histone acetylation is dynamically regulated by hats and hdacs, histone methylation is balanced by the activities of histone methylases  and histone demethylases   <cit> . plant histone methyltransferases are assigned to different protein groups based on sequence similarity with set domains  found in drosophila su3- <dig>  enhancer of zeste e, tritorax , and absent, small, or homeotic discs . these proteins function in covalent addition of one , two  or three  methyl groups to lysine residues in histone tails h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  arabidopsis su3- <dig> members have h3k <dig> methyltransferase activity and play a key function predominantly in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing  <cit> . enhancer of zeste e proteins catalyze h3k <dig> trimethylation and are involved in the repressive control of gene expression  <cit> . trx proteins mediate h3k <dig> methylation and are required for transcriptional gene activation as well as ash <dig> proteins that have a dual methyltransferase function for both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  <cit> . histone methylation occurs also at the arginine residues and is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferase   <cit> . arabidopsis histone methyltransferases and their importance in relation to plant development have recently been reviewed  <cit> . histone methylation has long been regarded as an irreversible mark until the discoveries in mammals of two families of hdms, kdm <dig>  also known as lysine-specific demethylase  <dig>  and the jmjc domain  containing proteins  <cit> . arabidopsis homologs of human lsd <dig> act to reduce the level of h3k <dig> methylation. they were discovered at the level of floral repressor flowering locus c , a key component of a regulatory network that controls the timing of the start of flowering  <cit> . the jmjc proteins are able to remove the methyl group on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  <cit> . unlike kdm <dig>  these proteins could reverse all the states  of lysine methylation  <cit> . furthermore, a member of the jmjc proteins has been shown to demethylate arginine h3r <dig> and h4r <dig> in animal cells  <cit> . however, arginine demethylase activity remains to be determined in plants. recent studies have revealed a role for arabidopsis jmjc proteins in several aspects of plant development such as floral transition  <cit> , gametophyte function  <cit> , and circadian rhythm  <cit> .

in spite of the crucial role emerging for epigenetic modifications in plant growth and development, little is known regarding hms in the important crop solanum lycopersicum. using the complete sequence of tomato genome as well as transcriptomes at different stages/organs  <cit>  we investigated hm genes through a bioinformatic approach. in this study we give a comprehensive overview of the structure, phylogeny and spatial expression of members belonging to the classical families of hms in tomato. furthermore, we shed light on the position of hms on the tomato genome. we combined this information and hm expression profiles with the phenotype of tomato introgression lines  in order to identify candidate genes involved in epigenetically regulated processes.

RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> histone modifiers  were identified in tomato. we systematically classified  <dig> proteins belonging to hats,  <dig> to hdacs,  <dig> to hmts, and  <dig> to hdms.

tomato hats
hags
the tomato genome encodes  <dig> proteins showing similarity to the hag group . one protein  was found related to the elp <dig> family and one  to the hat <dig> family. slhag <dig>  in addition to the at <dig> domain, also has a moz_sas motif  that is typical of myst acetyltransferases   <cit> . to date, this combination of domains was never reported. as regards the gcn <dig> family, no member appears to have been revealed in tomato by preliminary blast interrogation. however, a domain-based search allowed us to identify slhag <dig>  carrying a c-terminal brd domain  at the 3′-end of solyc10g <dig>  as a member of this family. two other proteins, solyc02g <dig>  and solyc03g <dig> , identified by domain analysis as plant hags, are unlikely histone acetylases. in fact, in addition to at <dig> they have an aak domain  that characterizes proteins involved in aminoacid synthesis  <cit> . interestingly, we found another family corresponding to hpa2-like hags thought previously to be specific to fungi  <cit> . the tomato hpa <dig> family includes most hags, namely  <dig> members, slhag <dig>  slhag <dig>  slhag <dig> to slhag <dig>  and slhag <dig> to slhag <dig> 


in order to infer the phylogenic history of tomato hags, we compared them with arabidopsis, maize and rice orthologs. hags are distributed in six main clades with high bootstrap values , three of which include monocots and dicots while the other three include only dicots. each clade contains one tomato hag family, except hpa <dig> whose members are split into two clades. interestingly, a subclade of hpa <dig> members includes eight genes  that are all closely localized on chromosome  <dig> in a cluster of about  <dig> kb. this finding suggests that the ancestral locus experienced a series of tandem duplication events.

the existence of so many hag members in the tomato proteome compared with arabidopsis as well as monocots led us to investigate hags in arabidopsis in greater depth. blast search using the at <dig> domain as a query returned  <dig> proteins in arabidopsis, thereby giving a number close to tomato. based on the domain composition, in arabidopsis we identified at2g <dig> and at4g <dig> which in addition to at <dig> have the aak domain . similarly to tomato, it is likely that these two proteins are not histone acetylases. phylogenetic analysis of tomato and arabidopsis hags indicates that the different subgroups evolved differently in these species . for example, gene duplication events giving rise to the subgroup including slhag <dig> to slhag <dig> likely occurred only in tomato while the orthogroup that comprises slhag <dig> appears to have experienced an expansion only in arabidopsis.

as mentioned above, slhag <dig> is a peculiar hag, having both the typical hat1_n domain and an moz_sas domain. in order to understand the origin of this combination of domains, we performed extensive research through interpro  into the genomes of fully sequenced organisms  and particularly in plants . intriguingly, a domain structure similar to that of slhag <dig> was found mostly in plants and additionally in the brown alga ectocarpus siliculosus  and in trichoplax adhaerens . the existence of slhag4-like proteins in different organisms suggests that histone acetylases with both hat1_n and moz_sas domains can be categorized as members of a new family which we name gnat/myst-like .

additional file  <dig> shows the proteins with the highest similarity to slhag <dig>  out of  <dig> species belonging to plantae,  <dig> evidenced proteins with both hat1_n and moz_sas domains. interestingly, these species are not randomly distributed among the different orders. indeed, gml proteins seem to be lacking in brassicales, poales, ranunculales and volvocales, although the scant sequence data suggest caution regarding this finding. the distribution of gml proteins in planta, animalia and in chromoalveolata suggests that the combined domains at <dig> and moz_sas occurred early on in evolutionary history. however, most of the organisms show hat1_n and moz_sas domains in two functional distinct families, gnat and myst histone acetylases, respectively. due to lack of information about the biological function of gml proteins, we can only speculate that the separation of the two domains could confer an advantage for nuanced control of the histone acetylation level in the genome.

to address the question of the possible function of tomato hags we examined their expression profiles in several organs . given the wide range of expression values, we categorized the tomato hags in three groups of low , middle  and high expression . among low-expressed members, slhag <dig> and slhag <dig> did not show any preferential expression in the analyzed organs as compared to the other members that might have a different function. slhag <dig> and slhag <dig> could play a role in vegetative development, and by contrast slhag <dig> and slhag <dig> in reproductive development. the middle-expressed group of genes evidenced broad-ranging activities, except slhag <dig> and slhag <dig> which are strongly expressed in leaves and roots, respectively. the expression profiles in the group of high-expressed members suggest a wide functional role for some hags  in contrast to slhag <dig> and slhag <dig> preferentially expressed in roots and leaves, respectively. the arabidopsis genome was predicted to encode three hags, athag <dig>  athag <dig> and athag <dig>  which belong to gcn <dig>  hat <dig> and elp <dig> families, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, hpa2-like hags also occur in arabidopsis and one member of this family  was recently found  <cit> . in tomato, the closest homologs of athag1/atgcn <dig>  athag <dig> and atmcc <dig> are slhag <dig>  slhag <dig> and slhag <dig>  respectively. such proteins are likely to accomplish specific functions in tomato as they do in arabidopsis since their genes show comparable expression profiles in similar organs, except for athag1/atgcn <dig>  in particular, athag <dig> plays an essential role in many plant development processes, such as meristem function, cell differentiation, leaf and floral organogenesis, and responses to light and cold  <cit> . athag <dig> is involved in transcription elongation, cell proliferation, leaf axis development, seedling and root growth  <cit> , and atmcc <dig> was shown to be involved in flowering time and meiosis  <cit> .


hams
the tomato proteome has one myst acetyltransferase, namely slham <dig>  that is a 477-aa long protein characterized by n-terminal chromo , c2h <dig> , and c-terminal moz_sas  domains, that are typical of class i hams  <cit> . previous studies have shown that other plant hams belong only to the class i  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis  shows that hams are distributed in two clades, one of which includes tomato as well as arabidopsis proteins. the other clade contains two proteins from monocots, maize and rice. this separation indicates that a single ancestral ham gene gave rise to hams in monocots and dicots, being a specific event of duplication at the origin of the expansion of this family in arabidopsis and maize. the expression pattern of slham <dig> shows that it is expressed in all the examined organs with the highest expression in flowers and in 3 cm fruit . latrasse and colleagues  <cit>  found that atham <dig> and atham <dig> are strongly expressed in flowers and act redundantly in male and female gametophyte development. this evidence suggests that slham <dig>  in addition to its putative role in seed and/or fruit development, could play a role in gametogenesis like the arabidopsis ortholog.

hacs
the present survey identified four proteins belonging to the hac group in tomato . as shown in figure 3a, the domain composition of hacs is variable but all share the typical domains of this class  <cit> . tomato hacs are included together with arabidopsis hacs in two main clades separated from the clade containing hacs of rice and maize lacking the zz-domain . in the most expanded clade , the dicots form a distinct group compared with monocots. overall, data suggest that different gene duplication events gave rise first to the two groups of hacs both in monocots and dicots, and subsequently to the expansion of this family in both phyla. interestingly, the expansion was slightly larger in arabidopsis than in tomato.


in order to gain insight into the possible role of tomato hacs, we examined their expression profiles in different tomato organs . slhac <dig> shows the strongest expression in fruit at different developmental stages. it is interesting that the peak of slhac <dig> expression occurs in mature green berries and is followed by a strong reduction in fruit at breaker stage, thereby suggesting a role in the transition between these two fruit developmental stages. slhac <dig> and slhac <dig>  forming a distinct clade, are the most widely expressed tomato hacs, with the latter showing lower expression values. similarity between slhac <dig> and slhac <dig> in terms of sequence and expression profile in reproductive organs suggests a functional redundancy that is analogously reported for arabidopsis homologs athac1/athac <dig> and athac1/athac <dig> <cit> . the presence of slhac <dig> and slhac <dig> in the same clade of arabidopsis athac <dig>  athac <dig> and athac <dig> further supports a role of these proteins in tomato reproduction. indeed, knockdown of athac <dig> induced reduced fertility and late flowering  <cit>  and analysis of hac1/hac <dig> and hac1/hac <dig> double mutants highlighted their role in flowering time in arabidopsis  <cit> . slhac <dig> is likely a pseudogene since it does not appear to be expressed in the tissues under analysis.

hafs
tomato proteome has one tafii <dig> protein   that shows the same domain composition of arabidopsis, rice and maize hafs  <cit> . phylogenetic comparison with these species evidenced that slhaf <dig> forms a distinct clade with athaf <dig> and athaf <dig> separated from oshaf <dig> and zmhaf <dig> . interestingly, slhaf <dig>  albeit expressed in all the organs considered, has the strongest expression in roots and in fruit, particularly in berries ten days after breaking, thereby suggesting an important role in fruit maturation .

tomato hdacs
hdas
investigation of the tomato proteome revealed nine rpd3/hda <dig> family members. the phylogeny of tomato hdas evidences that they cluster with hdas of arabidopsis, maize and rice  in accordance with the subdivision of this family into three classes as reported in the literature  <cit> . this family had a higher expansion in monocots, especially in rice, than in dicots where arabidopsis has the highest number. in addition to the hist_deacetyl domain , new conserved domains were found in tomato hdas as well as in orthologs of arabidopsis, rice and maize. indeed, as shown in figure  <dig>  class i slhdas have an stykc domain , and a ser/thr/tyr kinase catalytic domain, overlapping with the hist_deacetyl domain. moreover, a c-terminal cog <dig> domain, which is involved in dna-binding, is found in slhda <dig>  as regards class ii, a zf-ranbp domain , which binds ran-gdp involved in nuclear transport, occurred in slhda <dig> and in slhda <dig>  and a c-terminal nucleoside phosphorylase domain  together with a poz domain  was found. the presence of the poz domain, which is a homo/heterodimerizing domain evidenced in histone deacetylase-containing complexes, suggests that slhda <dig> could take part in a multi-protein complex. the occurrence of bp and np domains as well as a new domain arrangement  was also evidenced in arabidopsis hdas.


in order to understand the candidate function of tomato hdas, we looked at their expression profiles . given the wide range of expression values, we categorized the tomato hdas in three groups having low , middle  and high expression . slhda <dig> expressed mostly in root and bud is the lowest expressed gene among the tomato hdas. its expression profile suggests a role in highly dividing tissues such as root and flower meristems. the middle-expressed hda members show very different expression profiles. among them, slhda <dig> could exert a possible role in root development as supported by its strong expression in this organ and by its similarity to athda <dig> and athda <dig>  <cit> . a complementary role of slhda <dig>  slhda <dig> and slhda <dig> in fruit development from 1 cm to b <dig> stage is suggested by their peaks of expression in these stages. finally, the highly expressed slhda <dig> and slhda <dig> show the strongest expression at b <dig> and b fruit stages, respectively, thereby supporting a possible role in tomato fruit ripening. slhda <dig> and slhda <dig> have respectively a sequence similarity with athda <dig> and athda <dig> that in arabidopsis have been linked to flowering, embryo development and other biological processes  <cit> .

srts
in the tomato proteome, we identified two histone deacetylases belonging to the sir <dig> family, namely slsrt <dig> and slsrt <dig> . they are characterized by an sir <dig> domain  and correspond to lesrt <dig> and lesrt <dig>  previously described by pandey and colleagues  <cit> . the expression profiles of tomato srt genes evidence expression peaks of slsrt <dig> in bud and in 1 cm-sized fruit while slsrt <dig> was expressed in flower and in fruit at b <dig> . these findings suggest that slsrt <dig> could play a role in the early stages of fruit development as well as in early gamete development whereas slsrt <dig> is involved later in both fruit ripening and in gametogenesis. the expression profile of slsrt <dig> also supports a role in flc regulation as suggested for arabidopsis counterparts by bond and colleagues  <cit> .

hdts
according to the results of pandey and colleagues  <cit>  who described three hdts in tomato proteome  we found slhdt <dig>  slhdt <dig> and slhdt <dig> corresponding to hdt <dig>  hdt <dig> and hdt <dig>  respectively . slhdt <dig> shows a c-terminal zinc finger domain in addition to the predicted hd <dig> domain . the evolutionary history of plant hdts, including those of tomato, was well illustrated by pandey and colleagues  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  the preferential expression of tomato hdts occurs at early stages of fruit development. in particular, slhdt <dig> is highly expressed in 1 cm fruit, slhdt <dig> in both 1 cm- and 3 cm-sized fruits, slhdt <dig> in 3 cm fruit and in mature green berries. overall, these expression profiles suggest a role of tomato hdts in fruit development. interestingly, tomato hdts seem to be all closely related to athdt <dig>  that was shown to be involved in aba response and seed germination  <cit> .

tomato hmts
sdgs
we identified  <dig> set-domain group  proteins in tomato belonging to seven classes like arabidopsis sdgs according to the classification of springer and colleagues  <cit>  . in detail, three proteins, slsdg <dig>  sldg <dig> and slsdg <dig>  clustered with class i atsdgs  that are homologous to e . although slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> show similar domain architecture to arabidopsis class i sdgs, they have an additional sant domain, while sldg <dig> has lost the two conserved ezds . ten proteins, slsdg <dig> to slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> to slsdg <dig>  cluster with five arabidopsis proteins annotated as homologs to ash <dig>  . the expansion of this class in tomato likely arose from gene duplications generating also pseudogenes . tomato slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> to slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> show a domain arrangement similar to arabidopsis members while sdg <dig>  sdg <dig>  and sdg <dig> lack conserved domains of this class. six proteins  belong to class iii of sdgs , being homologous to trithorax . they have the same domain architecture  as their arabidopsis counterparts or a gyf and f-box  in addition to the set and post-set domains. moreover, we found that tomato as well as arabidopsis has proteins with three phd domains, contrasting with findings previously reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . slsdg <dig> has two phd domains but one seems to be truncated at the n-terminus because it lacks the pwwp domain. two trx-related proteins  belong to class iv sdgs . this class includes proteins only present in yeast and plants  <cit> . fourteen tomato sdgs  belong to class v . these are homologous to su3- <dig> and are distributed in two main clades containing members of the first or second subgroup of this class  <cit> . some members lack the post-set domain and others gain at-hook domains as the closest arabidopsis orthologs. seven members  cluster within class vi and two within class vii of sdgs . these classes include proteins with an interrupted set domain or set-related proteins. the domain architecture of tomato and arabidopsis members belonging to these classes is quite similar, except slsdg <dig> which shows a domain composition typical of class iii sdgs.


in order to gain insights into the biological role of tomato sdgs, we analyzed their expression profiles by grouping sdgs according to their class . slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig>  have similar expression profiles, being mainly expressed in root, bud and fruit up to 3 cm, while slsdg <dig> is mostly expressed in 2 cm fruit up to b stages. on the basis of these expression profiles we could argue that the first two genes play redundant roles in root and fruit development and slsdg <dig> is likely to be more specific to the later stages of fruit maturation.


as regards class ii sdgs, some genes with very specific peaks of expression may be noted. indeed, slsdg <dig> is strongly expressed in leaves, slsdg <dig> in fruit at the 3 cm stage, slsdg <dig> in flowers, and slsdg <dig> in buds. these expression profiles suggest a possible wide subfunctionalization of class ii sdgs in tomato with a low degree of redundancy. a role in fruit development could be played by slsdg <dig> with an expression profile similar to atsdg <dig> <cit>  which regulates gene expression in the carotenoid pathway  <cit> . slsdg <dig> is mostly expressed in buds and in the early stages of fruit development. interestingly, this gene could share some functions with its arabidopsis counterpart, atsdg <dig>  indeed, the latter mainly expressed in pollen is involved in pollen tube growth and reproduction in arabidopsis  <cit> . slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> were noticed to behave like pseudogenes, not being expressed in any of the organs analyzed.

among the class iii sdgs, slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> could play redundant roles in root development, as could slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> in fruit maturation. the latter is closely related to atsdg <dig> which was shown to affect vegetative growth and reproduction in arabidopsis by regulating the expression of hundreds of genes  <cit> . moreover, the expression profile of atsdg <dig> <cit>  is similar to that of slsdg <dig> in comparable organs, thereby supporting the idea of similar functions. slsdg <dig> is related to atsdg <dig> that was shown to regulate the expression of a xyloglucanase  <cit>  which belongs to a class of enzymes involved in tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . in a similar fashion, slsdg <dig> could act in fruit ripening since it is highly expressed in fruits, particularly at the mg stage. on the contrary, some degree of functional divergence seems to have occurred between slsdg <dig> and its homolog atsdg <dig> involved in flowering time in arabidopsis  <cit> . indeed, the latter is more expressed in flowers while slsdg <dig> is very poorly expressed in this organ.

the two members of tomato class iv sdgs have different expression profiles: while slsdg <dig> is strongly expressed in roots and fruit at the 1 cm stage, slsdg <dig> is mostly expressed in buds and in fruit at the b <dig> stage. these differences suggest that the two genes evolved different functions, with slsdg <dig> being mainly involved in reproduction.

tomato sdgs of class v may show a high degree of redundancy in some functions. indeed, slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> have their highest expression in fruit at 1 cm and 2 cm, slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> have their peak expression in fruit at the 3 cm stage, while slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> are particularly expressed in fruit at mg up to b <dig> stages. therefore, these expression profiles suggest that they might play roles in fruit and/or seed at sequential stages of development. moreover, slsdg <dig> is highly expressed in buds as well as slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig>  suggesting that they could have a function in meiosis or in flower development.

as with the above-reported sdgs, also the members of classes vi and vii may have a possible redundant function. for example, slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> are highly expressed in 1 cm fruit while slsdg <dig>  slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig> in 3 cm fruit, thereby suggesting sequential functions in embryo/fruit development. a more specific expression profile is shown by slsdg <dig> which evidenced peak expression in the bud, indicating a role in gamete and/or flower development. however, the putative involvement of these genes in development has not been investigated in any plant species.

prmts
we identified nine prmts in tomato . slprmt <dig> was already described by krause and colleagues  <cit>  and was named pam <dig> . specific patterns in the catalytic adomet_mtase domain   <cit>  allowed us to categorize slprmt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as class i prmts while slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> belong to class ii . for class i some duplication events were highlighted in dicot species.

the expression profiles of tomato prmts  suggest functional redundancy among these genes since some organs are characterized by two or more prmts with high expression levels. this is the case of roots where slprmt <dig>  slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> have their relative strongest expression. slprmt <dig>  slprmt <dig>  and slprmt <dig> were expressed in fruit at the 1 cm stage while slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> at the b <dig> stage. to investigate the biological function of slprmts, we considered the role of orthogroups in arabidopsis. slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> belong to the same clade as atprmt <dig> and atprmt <dig>  the latter were suggested to be in the same histone methylation complex on the basis of their physical interaction  <cit>  and spatial expression profiles. by contrast, slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> have quite different expression profiles and, when similar organs are compared between the two species, only the first has a profile resembling that of arabidopsis counterparts. on this basis, we hypothesize that slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> evolved independent functions, with slprmt <dig> perhaps retaining the biological role of atprmt <dig> and atprmt <dig>  if this is true, slprmt <dig> should be involved in flowering time, flower morphology and fertility as well as in leaf development  <cit> . slprmt <dig> is the closest homolog to atprmt <dig> which was shown to be a component in the autonomous pathway which controls the floral transition in an flc-dependent manner  <cit> . since the expression profiles of these two genes are comparable, slprmt <dig> might also have a functional role in flowering time. slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> grouped with atprmt <dig> and atprmt <dig> that were shown to redundantly control the floral transition  <cit> . accordingly to their functional redundancy, atprmt <dig> and atprmt <dig> have very similar expression profiles. on the other hand, slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> differ greatly in expression profile, also vis-à-vis their arabidopsis counterparts, when similar organs are compared  <cit> . slprmt <dig> and slprmt <dig> could play different roles in tomato development and might not be involved in flowering time. slprmt <dig> is the closest homolog to atprmt <dig>  which was shown to be involved in vegetative growth and flowering time  <cit> . the different expression profiles of atprmt <dig> <cit>  and slprmt <dig> suggest that the latter evolved a different role possibly in fruit maturation as evidenced by its expression peak in fruit at the mg stage.

tomato hdms
hdmas
in tomato, we identified  <dig> proteins showing similarity to hdma histone demethylases. all are characterized by the c-terminal amino_oxidase domain   but only six  also have the n-terminal swirm  domain that is conserved in all hdmas. as shown in additional file  <dig>  hdmas proteins are distributed in two main clades, comprising one  and five tomato members . phylogenetic analysis suggests that four ancestors gave rise to the present number of hdmas in tomato, and accordingly at least two events of gene duplication increased the number of hdmas from four to six. in particular, slhdma <dig>   <dig> and slhdma <dig>   <dig> could have been arisen from a tandem duplication event as suggested by their close position on chromosome seven .

the additional file  <dig> shows the expression profile of tomato hdmas, divided into three groups with low , mild  and high  expression. slhdma <dig> is barely detectable in buds and in fruit from 2 cm stage to b, while slhdma <dig> is mostly expressed in buds and flowers, suggesting a major role of the former gene in fruit development and the latter gene in gamete and/or flower development. slhdma <dig> and slhdma <dig> are detectable in all organs, pointing out a possible role for these genes throughout development including reproductive stages. slhdma <dig> is quite uniformly expressed in all plant organs and slhdma <dig> has a clear preferential expression in fruit from 2 cm stage to b <dig>  collectively, these profiles indicate that tomato hdmas could play redundant roles in different aspects of fruit development and slhdma <dig> could be the major histone demethylase in tomato. moreover, slhdma <dig> could play a role both in flowering time and root elongation, as suggested by its expression profile and its sequence similarity to athdma <dig>  <cit> .

jmjs
the tomato proteome reveals  <dig> proteins belonging to the jmj family of hdms. on the basis of their domain composition we classified them in five classes that take their names from their human counterparts: jmjc-only, kdm <dig>  jmjd <dig>  kdm <dig> and kdm <dig>  <cit> . the tomato jmjc-only class includes three proteins , the kdm <dig> class five proteins , and kdm <dig> class four proteins . the classes jmj <dig>  and kdm <dig>  include two and six members, respectively.

the evolutionary history of jmjs was inferred by comparing these proteins in tomato, arabidopsis, maize and rice . interestingly, a domain-based search led us to identify four new jmjc-only , two jmjd <dig>  and one kdm <dig>  proteins in the maize proteome that were absent in the chromdb and were included in our analysis. as shown in additional file  <dig>  hdms are distributed in five main clades, all of which include tomato proteins. three clades contain exclusively members of classes kdm <dig>  kdm <dig> and kdm5; the remaining clades contain members belonging both to classes jmj-only and jmjd <dig>  in the phylogenetic tree  two main groups of jmj-only were evidenced, including tomato members in one. this scenario suggests that one ancestor gave rise to the current number of jmj-only proteins in tomato. all the tomato members included in this class share the same domain architecture with their orthologs. kdm <dig> class members  are split into two main clades with two and three tomato proteins. one clade includes the c2hc2-domain proteins and the other the c5hc <dig> domain proteins  <cit> . sljmj <dig> and sljmj <dig> did not show the same domain architecture as the other slkdm <dig> since the c-terminal domain c2hc <dig> or c5hc <dig> is lacking. two duplication events in tomato as well as in maize and rice expanded the second group, while only an atjmj <dig> is encoded by the arabidopsis genome. the jmjd <dig> proteins  are split into two main clades, each including one tomato protein. the domain architecture of the first group is characterized by the presence of a kinase c-terminal aph domain , which is not observed in the other group.


phylogenetic analysis of the proteins belonging to this class suggests that they are highly conserved among species. the kdm <dig> class  is divided into two main clades, one of which has three tomato proteins, the other only one. the first includes the proteins with the c-terminal fyrn and fyrc domains and the other the bright/arid domain proteins  <cit> . sljmj <dig> lacks the conserved c-terminal domains  and sljmj <dig> has a duplication of the region encoding the plu- <dig> -phd domains. the plu- <dig> domain is involved in the dna-binding domain and it was not described before in jmj demethylases. the kdm <dig> phylogenetic tree  has two main clades with a high bootstrap value. interestingly, five proteins, three of which are found in tomato , have an n-terminal wrc domain  which includes a putative nuclear localization signal and a zinc-finger motif which was not described previously in this class. a modified ring-finger domain named r <dig>  was also identified in the tomato slmj <dig>  a tandem duplication of the sljmj <dig> gene was observed.


the wide expression profile of tomato jmjs  in several organs suggests that they could play a global role in plant development. however, some jmjs showed specific expression peaks, thereby suggesting particular roles. this is the case of sljmj <dig> and sljmj <dig> which are preferentially expressed in roots while sljmj <dig>  sljmj <dig>  sljmj <dig> and sljmj <dig> in buds and/or flowers, suggesting a role in gamete formation or flower development. interestingly, sljmj <dig> is the closest homolog to atjmj <dig>  which is highly expressed in flowers  <cit>  and acts as a repressor of the photoperiodic pathway  <cit> . sljmj <dig>  sljmj <dig>  sljmj <dig> and sljmj <dig> are particularly expressed in fruit at b <dig>  thus suggesting a role in later processes of fruit and/or embryo/seed development.

association of tomato hms to s. pennellii introgression lines : a case study
to identify candidate genes involved in epigenetically regulated processes by means of in silico analysis we looked for ils where hms were associated, based on their map position on the tomato genome . we failed to recover ils for slhag <dig>  which is not assigned to any chromosome , and for sljmj <dig> , slprmt <dig> , slsdg <dig> , slsdg <dig> , slsdg <dig>  located terminally on different chromosomes outside the available markers. we then combined the information about the phenotype of ils with hm expression profiles described in the previous sections.

as a case study, we report the identification of a candidate hm involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in tomato fruits. it should first be noted that the arabidopsis histone methyltransferase atsdg <dig> is required for the expression of the carotenoid isomerase atcrtiso <cit> . the tomato homolog of atcrtiso was characterized by isaacson and colleagues  <cit>  as an essential gene for the production of all trans-lycopene. as reported above, our analysis highlighted that two homologs of atsdg <dig> occur in tomato, i.e. slsdg <dig> and slsdg <dig>  it should be pointed out that slsdg <dig> is a stronger candidate than slsdg <dig> as it is involved in crtiso-like regulation and hence in the carotenoid composition of the tomato fruit. indeed, similar to what is observed for tomato crtiso, slsdg <dig> is upregulated during fruit ripening  with a peak of expression in fruit at b and b <dig>  furthermore, it maps on il4-3- <dig> that is reported to have a qtl affecting fruit color, which is known to be dependent on carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it is well known that a large genome dataset accelerates gene discovery in plants. in this study, we identified in silico  <dig> hms in tomato including  <dig> hats,  <dig> hdacs,  <dig> hmts, and  <dig> hdms. the characterization of hm proteins based on domain annotation was very useful for discovering new family members and new families. indeed, we revised the canonical family annotation of plant hags, reporting the existence in plants of hpa2-like proteins, so far described only in fungi. moreover, we found that hpa2-like proteins represent the largest group of hags both in arabidopsis and in tomato. furthermore, we identified a new hat family, named glm, revealing that it occurs in  <dig> plant species. phylogenetic analysis allowed us to trace the evolutionary history of plant hms, evidencing their diversification among dicot and monocot species included in this study. by analyzing the expression data of all the hms identified in this study, we were able to provide an overview of the putative role of these genes in tomato development. in this way we supplied useful inputs to discover genes with broader as well as more specific roles. our datasets might help to address several biological questions and explore the relationship between genomes and phenotypes. indeed, we propose to combine genome-wide knowledge of hms with the phenotype information of tomato ils to prioritize candidate genes involved in the process of interest.
