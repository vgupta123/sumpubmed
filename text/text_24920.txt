BACKGROUND
in metazoans, early embryonic development is governed entirely by post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> . during this period of development translational mechanisms dictate when and how efficiently each maternal mrna is translated into protein  <cit> . many insights into these mechanisms come from studies of oocytes and eggs from the frog xenopus laevis. for example, mechanisms that control maternal mrna translation during xenopus oocyte maturation are well studied and involve the regulated addition of 3' poly  to stored mrnas  <cit> . it is unclear, however, how conserved these mechanisms are at the level of individual mrnas. an understanding of such conservation should provide insights into how differences in target mrna sequences could affect translational regulation during maternally controlled development.

the specificity of maturation-specific polyadenylation of maternal mrnas during xenopus oocyte maturation is controlled by sequences within the 3'utrs of these mrnas called cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements . cpes are binding sites for cpeb   <cit> . in xenopus oocytes cpeb binds other proteins, such as maskin that repress the translation of cpe-containing mrnas  <cit> . during oocyte maturation cpeb phosphorylation stimulates its association with proteins that promote mrna polyadenylation and translation  <cit> . cpeb is highly conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that cpe-regulated polyadenylation and translational activation during development is a highly conserved mechanism. in addition, recent studies have reported that some xenopus maternal mrnas contain polyadenylation response elements  that direct cpeb independent polyadenylation  <cit> , but it is unclear whether pre type polyadenylation occurs in organisms other than xenopus  <cit> . therefore, aside from studies in xenopus, the mechanisms that control mrna polyadenylation and translation during development in other vertebrate organisms have not been explored.

in this report we examine translational regulation of the maternal cyclin b <dig> mrna during zebrafish oocyte maturation. zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos offer many advantages for studying the maternal stages of vertebrate development. for example, maternal genes that regulate development have been identified in genetic screens  <cit> , and the proteins encoded by these genes have provided insights into early vertebrate embryogenesis  <cit> . however, the mechanisms that govern maternal gene expression in zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos have not been explored. we chose to focus on cyclin b <dig> mrna because its regulated polyadenylation and translation have been studied extensively during xenopus oocyte maturation, and cpe-regulated translation is best characterized during this process. using microinjection of reporter mrnas into both zebrafish and xenopus oocytes, we found that although translational regulation of both species' cyclin b <dig> mrna was qualitatively similar, it differed quantitatively in terms of efficiency of both polyadenylation and translation. these quantitative differences were likely due distinctions between the 3'utrs of zebrafish and xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrnas. these findings suggest that cpe-sequences and/or other aspects of 3'utr sequence architecture evolved between species to modulate translational efficiency of maternal mrnas, even those mrnas that encode highly conserved proteins.

RESULTS
zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna was polyadenylated during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis
translation of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna is activated during oocyte maturation but the underlying mechanisms have not been examined  <cit> . however, extensive analysis of xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna has demonstrated that poly  addition regulates the translation of this mrna during oocyte maturation. therefore, we analyzed the polyadenylation state of the endogenous zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna during zebrafish oocyte maturation. for this analysis rnaseh treatment of purified rna samples was used to sever the 3'utr from the cyclin b <dig> mrna and facilitate the direct detection of a 3' poly  tail by rna blot hybridization  <cit> . rna isolated from oocytes, matured oocytes and two-cell embryos was hybridized to a dna oligonucleotide complementary to the cyclin b <dig> orf  addition site) and half of each sample was also hybridized to oligo-dt to remove poly  . each sample was treated with rnaseh and analyzed subsequently by high resolution rna blot hybridization with a radiolabeled probe complementary to the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr. the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna from oocytes either lacked or possessed only an extremely short poly  tail as the size of the 3'utr was by unaffected by the addition of oligo dt . in contrast, the cyclin b <dig> mrna from matured oocytes and 2-cell embryos possessed a poly  tail that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length . similar results were obtained using rna-ligated rt-pcr to measure poly  tails   <cit> . therefore, the endogenous zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna was polyadenylated during oocyte maturation coincident with its translational activation  <cit> .

polyadenylation of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna depended upon u-rich 3'utr sequences
during xenopus oocyte maturation, cytoplasmic polyadenylation of maternal mrnas depends upon specific sequence elements within mrna 3'utrs: typically the cpe  and the aauaaa hexanucleotide  <cit> . a subset of xenopus mrnas are polyadenylated due to the presence of pre   <cit> . the vast majority of eukaryotic mrnas contain the highly conserved aauaaa hexanucleotide within their 3' utrs. aauaaa is required for formation of the primary mrna transcript's mature 3' end, which involves both the cleavage and polyadenylation of the newly synthesized transcript in the nucleus  <cit> . aauaaa is also required for the cytoplasmic polyadenylation that occurs on only a subset of maternal mrnas during vertebrate development. this subset of mrnas also contains cpes. in contrast to aauaaa, cpes vary in terms of numbers, exact sequence and position within the 3'utr. the canonical cpe sequence is uuuuau, but the non-canonical sequences uuuuucau, uuuuaau and uuuuacu can also direct cytoplasmic polyadenylation  <cit> . the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr contains four cpes close to the aauaaa . mutations affecting either the aauaaa sequence or all four cpes abolish maturation specific polyadenylation  <cit> . mutation of any single cpe is not sufficient to abolish polyadenylation, suggesting some redundancy among these elements.

to help define putative cpes in the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr, we compared the cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs from zebrafish and xenopus. although cyclin b <dig> protein is highly conserved, the cyclin b <dig> mrna's 3'utrs exhibit very limited sequence identity . nevertheless, the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr contains two sequences of four contiguous u nucleotides positioned immediately 3' to aauaaa. these characteristics, u-rich sequences close to aauaaa are hallmarks of cpes found in the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr . there is another u-rich sequence , but since cpe function decreases significantly as the distance from the aauaaa sequence increases  <cit>  we focused on potential u-rich sequences closest to the hexanucleotide. to test whether the u-rich sequences in the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr functioned as cpes, two radiolabeled 3'utr rnas  were generated. the wt rna contained the wild type 3'utr and the cpe-mut rna contained uu to cg substitutions within each of the two putative cpes in the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr . both radiolabeled rnas were injected into zebrafish oocytes and a fraction of injected oocytes were exposed to 7α, 20β-dihydroxyprogesterone to induce maturation, while the remaining fraction was left untreated. oocyte maturation was monitored based on translucence, a defining characteristic of mature zebrafish oocytes . after maturation was complete, rna was isolated from injected oocytes and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. a portion of the injected wt cyclin b <dig> 3'utr rna increased in size during oocyte maturation  due to the addition of a poly  as treatment with oligo-dt/rnaseh converted the high molecular weight species to the size of the injected rna . in contrast, the cpe-mut cyclin b <dig> 3'utr rna was not polyadenylated during oocyte maturation . these results suggested that the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr contained u-rich cpes required for polyadenylation during oocyte maturation.

the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utr was sufficient to activate translation during oocyte maturation in a cpe- and aauaaa-dependent manner
to analyze the role of the cyclin b <dig> 3'utr on translational activation, a luciferase reporter mrna fused to the 3'utr of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna was generated  . the wild type reporter mrna  was injected into zebrafish oocytes that were subsequently treated as described above for fig.  <dig>  extracts from the injected cells were assayed for luciferase activity. changes in translational activity during oocyte maturation were expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity from matured oocytes to that from non-matured oocytes . translation of the wild type reporter mrna  was stimulated almost  <dig> fold during zebrafish oocyte maturation . this stimulation was specific for the cyclin b <dig> 3'utr as translation of other reporter mrnas that contained no 3'utr , or the cytoskeletal b-actin 3'utr were not stimulated significantly during oocyte maturation . thus, the 3'utr of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna contained sequences that could activate translation during oocyte maturation.

to test whether the same sequences required for zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna polyadenylation  were also required for translational activation, luciferase reporter mrnas were generated that contained the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utrs in which the two cpe  or the aauaaa  sequences were mutated . translational activity of these mutant reporter mrnas was compared to the wild type reporter in zebrafish oocyte microinjection experiments as described above. mutation of either the cpe sequences  or the aauaaa  that abolished zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna polyadenylation  significantly reduced the ability of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna's 3'utr to stimulate translation of the luciferase reporter mrna during oocyte maturation . rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that the injected wild type, cpe-mutant and aauaaa mutant reporter mrnas were equally stable in mature and non-mature oocytes . therefore, the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr can activate mrna translation during oocyte maturation and this activation depends upon the same cpe and aauaaa sequences required for maturation-specific polyadenylation.

to directly assess the role of the poly  tail on translation in zebrafish oocytes, translation of two additional luciferase reporter mrnas was measured in zebrafish oocytes. these reporters were identical except for the presence of a fifty-nucleotide 3' poly  tail.   <cit> . equal amounts of each mrna were injected into separate groups of oocytes. the injected oocytes were cultured for six hours  and then extracts prepared from these oocytes were assayed for luciferase activity. translation of the reporter mrna containing the poly  tail  was significantly higher than that of the reporter mrna lacking a poly  tail , indicating that presence of a poly  tail was sufficient to stimulate mrna translation in zebrafish oocytes . therefore, 3' poly  is sufficient to enhance translation in zebrafish oocytes.

the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr was less efficiently polyadenylated and less effective at enhancing translation during either zebrafish or xenopus oocyte maturation
the 3'utrs of the zebrafish and xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrnas share little sequence similarity aside from the presence of cpes and the aauaaa hexanucleotide elements . we noted that zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna appeared to be less efficiently polyadenylated in zebrafish oocytes than what has been observed for xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna in xenopus oocytes   <cit> . efficiency refers to both the fraction of the rna that receives poly and the length of poly added. to test whether these differences might be due to differences in the sequences of the zebrafish and xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs or instead due to differences in the effectiveness of the polyadenylation and translational machinery present in these two species' oocytes, microinjection experiments of the relevant rnas were performed with both zebrafish and xenopus oocytes. radiolabeled zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr rnas were injected into xenopus oocytes and after inducing maturation the injected rnas were isolated and analyzed for polyadenylation as in figure  <dig>  the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr-wt rna was polyadenylated with a modest efficiency during xenopus oocyte maturation  that was similar to what we observed when this rna was analyzed during zebrafish oocyte maturation . for the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr-wt rna, phosphoimager quantitation indicated that approximately 50% of the rna is polyadenylated  . in addition, the same cpe sequences important for polyadenylation of cyclin b <dig> 3'utr during zebrafish oocyte maturation were also important during xenopus oocyte maturation . in the converse experiment, we analyzed wild type and mutant versions of the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr rna during zebrafish oocyte maturation . the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr rna was efficiently polyadenylated  during zebrafish oocyte maturation, just as it is during xenopus oocyte maturation  <cit> . furthermore, the cpe elements identified as essential for this polyadenylation during xenopus oocyte maturation  <cit>  were also essential for the polyadenylation of this rna during zebrafish oocyte maturation . thus the differences in efficiency of cyclin b <dig> mrna polyadenylation during xenopus and zebrafish oocyte maturation resulted from differences between the xenopus and zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs.

we also tested whether the two different cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs provided different levels of translational activation to a luciferase reporter mrna during either xenopus or zebrafish oocyte maturation. the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr enhanced translation of the luciferase reporter mrna more effectively than the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr regardless of which species' oocytes were used for the experiment . during oocyte maturation in both species, translational stimulation was due to the same sequences within the 3'utrs required for polyadenylation . with the cpe-mut reporter rna a small amount of stimulation was still observed raising the possibility of other elements that make detectable, but minimal contributions to translation . together these results indicate that differences in translational efficiency of cyclin b <dig> mrna were due to sequence differences between the zebrafish and xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utrs.

discussion
in this report, we examined the underlying mechanisms required for the translational activation of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna during zebrafish oocyte maturation. as expected based on extensive studies in xenopus, the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> was polyadenylated during maturation, coincident with its translational activation  <cit> . in addition the 3'utr of this mrna was sufficient to activate translation of a luciferase reporter mrna microinjected into zebrafish oocytes induced to mature in vitro. both polyadenylation and translational activation of relevant zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrnas required aauaaa and cpe-like sequences. these data together with the analysis of cyclin b <dig> in mouse  <cit>  revealed that the fundamental mechanisms underlying translational activation of the cyclin b <dig> mrna in vertebrate organisms are conserved. however, despite this conservation, we found that the efficiency by which the highly conserved cyclin b <dig> mrna was polyadenylated and translated during xenopus and zebrafish oocyte maturation differed substantially between these two species. these differences were likely not due to differences in the polyadenylation and translational machinery between these two species oocytes, but rather to differences in the 3'utrs of their respective cyclin b <dig> mrnas. thus, variations in 3'utr sequences and architecture may contribute to controlling different species' needs for translational efficiency of individual mrnas while relying on the same highly conserved protein components.

cpe-recognition by cpeb and the zorba protein
the cpeb binds to cpe sequences in the 3'utrs of xenopus mrnas to provide specificity for maturation-specific poly  addition for many maternal mrnas  <cit> . cpeb proteins bind cpes via the rrm and zinc finger domains found at their c-termini  <cit> . the zebrafish ortholog of cpeb is called zorba  <cit> . the cyclin b <dig> 3'utrs from zebrafish and xenopus activate mrna translation during oocyte maturation in both their normal and heterologous contexts, suggesting that the xenopus cpeb and zebrafish zorba proteins recognize the same rna sequences to direct polyadenylation. the amino acid sequences of the xenopus cpeb and zorba protein share 61% identity over the entire protein and 91% identity over the rrm and zinc finger domains  <cit> . this high degree of conservation is entirely consistent with the functional comparison of the xenopus and zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utrs during both species' oocyte maturation processes reported here. the uuuuaaag and uuuu sequences identified in the zf cyclin b <dig> 3' utr suggest variant non-consensus cpes, although we have not yet tested direct interaction with either cpeb or zorba.

structural and functional differences in the 3'utrs of the cyclin b <dig> mrnas
our results indicate that structural differences between the zebrafish and xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs are responsible for the functional differences in each 3'utr's ability to direct polyadenylation and activate translation of cyclin b <dig> mrna. the sequences of the cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs from zebrafish and xenopus are quite different and exhibit little sequence identity . and, even though both 3'utrs contain cpes the number and position of cpes present in the two 3'utrs differ . the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr has two putative cpes downstream of the aauaaa hexanucleotide while the xenopus 3'utr contains four cpes, one downstream of the hexanucleotide and three upstream. in addition, pumilio binding elements  present in the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr direct translational repression in non-matured oocytes  <cit> . the 3'utr of the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna lacks any obvious putative pbes. thus the number of cpes present and their position relative to aauaaa may dictate the efficiency of poly  addition and translation directed from a particular 3'utr. this observation is consistent with the results of a recent mutational analysis of cpe function in xenopus  <cit> . similar differences in 3'utr architecture are also observed comparing the 3'utrs from other xenopus mrnas known to be polyadenylated during oocyte maturation to their zebrafish orthologs . putative cpes are present in the zebrafish 3'utrs as predicted, but the arrangement and number of putative cpes and the presence of putative pbes differ with each pair of 3'utr orthologs. based on our analysis of cyclin b <dig> mrna, we predict that these differences will lead to differences in the efficiency of poly  addition and translation for each mrna, potentially as predicted by pique etal  <dig>  <cit> . this regulatory strategy allows for individualized modes of translation to ensure that specific proteins are synthesized at the proper levels to meet the unique demands of each species of developing embryos. interestingly, the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna is localized to the animal pole of oocytes and eggs. this localization confines the mrna to the embryo blastodisc where synthesis of cyclin b <dig> protein directs cell division during development. in contrast, the cyclin b <dig> mrna in xenopus is not localized. the large size of xenopus eggs may require higher concentrations of cyclin b <dig> protein to drive early cell divisions. such a need for producing higher concentrations of cyclin b <dig> protein could explain the observed differences in translational efficiency of the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr compared to the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr.

CONCLUSIONS
our data strongly suggest that the fundamental mechanisms underlying translational activation of the cyclin b <dig> mrna in vertebrate organisms are conserved. however, despite this conservation, we found that the efficiency by which the highly conserved cyclin b <dig> mrna was polyadenylated and translated during xenopus and zebrafish oocyte maturation differed substantially between these two species. these differences were not due to differences in the polyadenylation and translational machinery between these two species oocytes, but could be attributed to the distinct 3'utr elements of the respective cyclin b <dig> mrnas. thus, variations in 3'utr sequences and architecture may contribute to controlling different species' needs for translational efficiency of individual mrnas while relying on the same highly conserved trans-acting machinery.
