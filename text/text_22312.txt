BACKGROUND
a recent phylogeny placed tunicata as the sister group of vertebrates  <cit> . this new position rejects traditional views of a tunicata – cephalochordata – vertebrata succession  <cit>  and it casts new light on comparative studies  <cit> . the taxonomic status of c. intestinalis l., the tunicate species most widely used for research purposes, was recently resolved with the discovery of two cryptic taxa, named c. intestinalis spp. a and b  <cit> . this finding prompts careful re-evaluation of research data, as it is reasonable that literature concerning c. intestinalis sensu linnaeus refers to both cryptic species. affinities with vertebrates are visible in the body plan organization of ascidian larvae and, despite major morphological rearrangements during metamorphosis, they are also retained in sessile adults  <cit> . sequencing of c. intestinalis genome revealed an estimated number of protein-coding genes  similar to invertebrates and only about half of vertebrates  <cit> . gene density is estimated to be  <dig> locus per  <dig>  kb . c. intestinalis genes contain, on average,  <dig>  exons. from the genomic point of view, the presence of several hundred genes having higher sequence similarity with drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans than with vertebrates  <cit> , as well as the small gene number, are indicative of species ancestry. moreover, the genome is rich in at . two derived features of the c. intestinalis genome are the presence of gene duplication events not detected in vertebrates, and the derived loss of ancestral genes that are conserved in chordates   <cit> . this latter phenomenon has been estimated to be around 35% and 45% more frequent in c. intestinalis than, respectively, in pufferfish and humans. recent data on the congeneric species c. savignyi  <cit>  revealed an impressive level of genomic variation, such that this species exhibits the "... highest rates of  polymorphisms ever comprehensively quantified in a multicellular organism". more specifically, c. savignyi shows a very high level of haplome-specific dna ; this degree of variability between single haploid genomes originates from an enormous amount of various size indels throughout the genome  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are one of the most important categories of genetic markers in the field of population genetics and human diseases. snps are base pair substitutions in the dna of individuals  <cit> , and are by far the most common type of molecular polymorphism in living organisms. given this definition, single base pair insertions/deletions  are not formally considered as snps. on the other hand, single base pair substitutions in cdna are often included in this category of dna variation, although they may result from errors in mrna editing. about  <dig> snp per kb and  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp occur in homo sapiens  <cit>  and aedes aegypti  <cit> , respectively. this very high variability represents a unique source of molecular markers. biallelic snps are randomly distributed across the genome and have a low mutation rate   <cit> : this property makes it easier to calculate mutational rates in snps than, for example, in microsatellites. although a restriction to four character states makes snps less informative than microsatellites for linkage and population genetics, synonymous coding as well as non-coding snps are still useful markers for these applications since they are not under natural selection. non-synonymous snps in coding dna regions are mostly used to enhance understanding of the molecular genetic basis of phenotypic variation, with a particular relevance for human-disease research. technical progress in snp detection  <cit>  has turned this polymorphism into the most reliable marker for genomic approaches. in spite of their importance, few data concerning occurrence of snps in natural populations of lower chordates  are available  <cit> . such analysis would greatly contribute to a deeper knowledge of genetic variability in evolutionary key model organisms, in particular when research is based on natural populations. in c. intestinalis, allelic polymorphism is equal to  <dig> % on average, and it may reach peaks of 10–15% within short  regions  <cit> , although these data are still matter of debate  <cit> . large-scale analysis in c. savignyi revealed an average snp heterozygosity of  <dig> %, with a ts/tv ratio of  <dig>  and a quasi-equal distribution of the various types of transversions  <cit> .

genes belonging to the hox family of transcription factors are control leaders in the definition of the antero-posterior axis of all bilaterians analyzed so far. usually, hox genes are structured in chromosomal clusters displaying an ordered succession of paralogy group members. a general dogma states the colinearity rule: more 3' located genes possess more anterior and earlier onsets of expression . recent studies in tunicates  <cit>  and in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus  <cit>  revealed that coordinated spatial expression of hox genes persists even in presence of a rearranged distribution of paralogy groups within the cluster. therefore, understanding the evolutionary and functional scenarios of unclustered or unconventionally clustered hox genes is a crucial task.

herein, we studied snp occurrence in c. intestinalis sp. a and sp. b. we developed exon-primed-intron-centered   <cit>  primers in order to allow inter-specific genetic comparisons in  <dig> coding and  <dig> non-coding regions. for two adjacent hox genes  displaying an inverted position, genetic distance and linkage disequilibrium  were calculated using snp markers in a backcross panel.

RESULTS
dna amplification and detection of snps
a total of  <dig> epic and  <dig> non-epic primer pairs were pcr-tested on  <dig> genomic dna samples from different c. intestinalis sp. a populations. twelve primers were used to amplify reliable products , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp length . consequently, we analyzed a total of  <dig> bp:  <dig> from intronic nuclear regions,  <dig> from two nuclear exons  and  <dig> from the mt-dna coi  gene. we detected  <dig> transition/transversion snps  and  <dig> single base indels .

abbreviations: bp, length of the amplified sequence; nh, number of haplotypes; ts, transition; tv, transversion; ∑, total; ps, polymorphic sites; π, nucleotide diversity; f, frequency; t <dig>  tamura-nei genetic distance ; l'sp, lake's paralinear genetic distance.

no snps were observed in the mitochondrial coi gene,  <dig> in the hox <dig> and  <dig> in the gsx coding regions. our data indicate that the observed transition/transversion  ratio in the coding regions analyzed in this study is equal to  <dig>  . the ts/tv  observed within c. intestinalis sp. a coding and non-coding regions is considerably lower than the ratio found in c. savignyi   <cit> . this difference is likely due to the regions here analyzed, namely non-coding intragenic and coding genic, whereas previous estimations were based on all genome sequences  <cit> .

snp frequency distribution in the non-coding dna amplified regions displays a high degree of variability. hox- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and evxa genes are sequentially located along the chromosome # <dig>  <cit> . notably, the highest snp frequency occurs within those hox genes  that have lost the archetypal genomic organization.

types and frequencies of snps
overall, snps represent 48% of sequence polymorphisms in the  <dig> kb region analyzed in this study, with a frequency of  <dig>  snps every  <dig> bp . the remaining 52% of polymorphisms consists of  <dig> bp or longer indels and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms. the high level of non-snps fits well with previous estimates in other multicellular organisms  <cit> .

the occurrence of snps partially reflects the different c. intestinalis populations. for instance, all nine individuals from the fusaro lagoon display a t ↔ c transition at position  <dig> of the hox <dig> locus, while only two individuals present an a ↔ g transition at position  <dig>  in particular, most of non-synonymous changes are carried by individuals from geographically disjunct populations . strain-specificity of non-synonymous snps is generally assumed to reflect adaptive responses to distinct environmental conditions  <cit> .

concerning non-coding dna regions, the overall number  and frequency  of transition snps is slightly predominant. furthermore, analysis of nuclear exonic regions indicates that the aforementioned transition prevalence is even more evident in the coding dna . this is not surprising since it is generally accepted that the frequently occurring 5-methylcytosine de-amination reactions cause transition overrepresentation in genomes  <cit> . significant differences in the ts/tv ratio between non-coding and coding dna regions have been previously observed  <cit> , indicating that transitions occur more frequently in coding regions. polymorphisms along the  <dig>  kb nuclear coding dna causes  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous changes . the synonymous/non-synonymous  ratio  here reported is in contrast with the average s/ns ratio found in c. savignyi   <cit> . it is assumed that overrepresentation of non-synonymous nucleotide changes is strictly associated with adaptive evolution  <cit> . in agreement, this mechanism may have played a crucial role in functional divergence of hox genes after cluster duplications along the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . being tunicates the closest relatives of vertebrates, our data lend support to the hypothesis that adaptive evolution on hox and parahox genes was already active in basal chordates.

abbreviations: sp, cryptic species; s, synonymous substitutions; ns, non-synonymous substitutions.

among different genes herein analyzed, non-coding dna snps are highly variable in types and frequency. transitions are predominant in 4/ <dig> loci, while transversions prevail in 5/ <dig>  in one case , ts/tv ratio is equal to one. the two transition substitution types are comparably represented . concerning transversions, a ↔ t substitutions are prevalent , while a ↔ c, g ↔ c and g ↔ t are underrepresented . however,  <dig> % of all a ↔ t transversions are from a single intron  and all four types of transversions are never observed at a single locus.

twenty-nine  <dig> base-pair indels were found in the analyzed non-coding loci, and  <dig> in the hox <dig> coding region. all indels in coding dna were found in only one individual from an adriatic sea population. whether this data reflects partial or total loss of function of hox <dig> remains elusive. unlike coding sequences, all analyzed non-coding regions present a clear quantitative relationship between snps and  <dig> bp indels , in support of some kind of structural and/or functional correlation between mechanisms leading to the appearance of different types of polymorphism  <cit> .

snps in ciona intestinalis sp. b
all pairs of epic primers used to amplify c. intestinalis sp. a genomic dna were successfully tested in c. intestinalis sp. b . among them,  <dig> associated with non-coding  and  <dig> with coding regions  have been used to investigate snp presence, using  <dig> to  <dig> specimens for each locus. in total,  <dig> snps were detected . on average,  <dig>  snps were detected every  <dig> bp in coding regions, compared with  <dig>  snps every  <dig> bp in the same c. intestinalis sp. a loci. in the cryptic species b, hox <dig> snp frequency is higher than the one detected in non-coding regions . snps cause  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous amino acidic changes at the hox <dig> locus, and  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous at the coi locus . previous analysis indicated the presence of a single mitochondrial haplotype shared by all mediterranean populations of c. intestinalis sp. a. conversely, c. intestinalis sp. b displays a variable coi in north european seas, suggestive of fixed populations  <cit> . present results support the idea that the actual status of c. intestinalis sp. a in the mediterranean sea is due to a colonization by a mitochondrial variant, as well as the existence of more structured c. intestinalis sp. b populations  <cit> .

among snps in non-coding regions, the ts/tv ratio is equal to  <dig> , and so it is similar to the ratio detected in sp. a . a ↔ g are more frequent than c ↔ t. a ↔ t are the most common transversion. the ratio of snp mutations over total polymorphisms  is similar in the two cryptic species .

in conclusion, all epic and non-epic primers that were designed taking advantage of the genome sequence of c. intestinalis sp. a, perfectly amplify homologous loci in c. intestinalis sp. b. opposite to coding regions, frequency and ts/tv ratio in non-coding regions are very similar. altogether, data are suggestive of genome behavior in the two cryptic species with shared and divergent traits.

genomic location
the organization of the hox cluster in c. intestinalis  <cit>  is characterized by an atypical arrangement. two main differences can be observed: a) the cluster is broken  and b) paralogy groups do not respect the canonical 3' → 5' succession  . in this context, variability at these loci acquires a peculiar relevance. our analysis shows  that, among all analyzed loci , hox <dig> and hox <dig> display the highest nucleotide diversity  in non-coding regions. similarly, the total number  and frequency  of snps are the highest ones. in these loci, the number of observed transition substitutions is the highest among all genes analyzed, while the number of a ↔ t transversions is notably overrepresented in the hox <dig> non-coding region . tamura and nei  and lake's paralinear  genetic distance calculated within the same sub-sample of specimens, concordantly assign higher values  to hox <dig> and hox <dig> than to any other loci screened for snps .

the hox <dig> and hox <dig> genes have retained the archetypal genomic topology within the genome of c. intestinalis sp. a. these loci display a low snp frequency . more generally, the total number of polymorphisms  and nucleotide diversity  is notably low.

haplotypes structure, linkage disequilibrium and genetic mapping
with the aim to genetically characterize populations of c. intestinalis sp. a inhabiting the fusaro lagoon  and the harbour of castellamare di stabia  , we have identified  <dig> distinct haplotypes for the hox <dig> locus, and  <dig> for the hox <dig> one . specimens carrying the most frequent haplotypes  have been selected as parental individuals in a backcross for snp-based ld and genetic mapping of this region. in four  of  <dig> backcross individuals, analysis failed to detect any snps in both loci. in addition, detection of hox <dig> and hox <dig> snps failed in, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  individuals. the final matrix consisted of  <dig> samples, using a 50% threshold for missing genotypes. observed vs expected heterozygosity was calculated with haploview using phased haplotype files. we evaluated ld in the backcross generation using the lewontin's d'  <cit>  and correlation factor r <dig>  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium  between genic loci is equal to  <dig> , and r <dig> is  <dig>  . the coefficient r <dig> increases in the backcross generation from the value detected in f <dig> . a genetic map was generated anchoring snp loci to the same chromosome with mapmaker/exp v. <dig>  the obtained cm value  is  <dig> , with a  <dig>  threshold between the two loci. linkage was correlated with physical distances by using a genome browser   <cit> . being hox <dig> and hox <dig> separated by  <dig> kb, including some unresolved nucleotide stretches ,  <dig> cm corresponds to  <dig>  kb .

the recombination ratio for the hox10/hox <dig> region in c. intestinalis sp. a is consistent with previous results, despite some ambiguity concerning the taxonomic status of parents  <cit> . in the highly polymorphic fu/hc locus of the colonial tunicate, botryllus schlosseri,  <dig> cm corresponds to approximately  <dig> kb  <cit> . hence, the high recombination rate of the hox10/hox <dig> region is suggestive of a peculiar variability, and it provides an interesting point of discussion about disrupted topology of hox clusters.

snp reliability
different methods were used in order to assess the validity of the snps analyzed in the present paper. first, only snps confirmed by two independent pcr, three clones for each pcr, were kept for further analysis. this first step was applied in both c. intestinalis sp. a and sp. b. second, we analyzed segregation ratios in the fui/cds f <dig> crosses. all snps displayed the expected 1: <dig> ratio of mendelian inheritance. therefore, all data herein reported are reliably not due to sequencing artifacts.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> snps through sequencing of  <dig> kb genomic dna of c. intestinalis sp. a. all primers used to amplify genomic dna were successfully tested in c. intestinalis sp. b, allowing inter-specific comparison. as expected, snp frequency is lower in coding than in non-coding regions  <cit> . also, snp frequency is not constant in intronic dna. variability likely depends on the genomic location of analyzed sequence. in particular, we identified a highly polymorphic region in correspondence of hox <dig> and hox <dig>  two genes that have inverted their paralogy group position within the typical topology of hox clusters. the dominance of non-synonymous vs synonymous snps in hox coding regions suggests that adaptive evolution is acting on these genes. in order to establish the genetic map of this region, we performed a snp-based approach to measure cm distance between two hox genes in a backcross generation. we calculated linkage disequilibrium and correlated genetic and physical distances.

in this report, we analyzed snp occurrence in c. intestinalis sp. a at intra- and inter-population levels, providing an important source of genetic markers for linkage, population and comparative studies. our data indeed represent a further step toward the establishment of a unique integrative system for comparative genomics in chordates, consisting of two cryptic  and one congeneric  species.

we also calculated the genetic distance within a genomic region of particular interest. this data will contribute to in-depth investigations concerning the mechanisms the maintain hox colinearity in absence of a coordinated genomic organization.
