BACKGROUND
seven transmembrane-spanning receptors in eukaryotes regulate intracellular processes in response to extracellular signals through their interaction with signal-transducing heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding regulatory proteins   <cit> . cdnas from five g protein β subunit genes  have been identified by molecular cloning. the gβ <dig> isoform shares much less homology with other isoforms  and is preferentially expressed in brain  <cit> . a longer splice variant of gβ <dig>  gβ5l, is present in retina  <cit> . gβ <dig> and gβ5l, but not the other gβ isoforms, can form tight heterodimers with the r <dig> subfamily of regulator of g protein signaling  proteins: rgs <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> , an interaction mediated by a gγ-like  domain present in the r <dig> subfamily of rgs proteins  <cit> .

the function of gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes in brain and the role of the subcellular localization of the complex in such function are unclear. we previously demonstrated the multi-compartmental subcellular localization of gβ <dig> and r <dig> proteins to the plasma membrane, cytosol, and cell nucleus in neurons and brain using subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy  <cit> . we also found that the interaction of gβ <dig> with the ggl-domain containing rgs proteins directs its nuclear localization  <cit> . previous work with recombinant gβ5-rgs <dig> complex expressed in sf <dig> insect cells suggested it was the palmitoylation status of rgs <dig> that determined the membrane versus cytosolic localization of the complex  <cit> . more recently an r <dig> binding protein  was discovered that binds tightly to gβ5-r <dig> protein complexes  <cit> . r7bp is itself palmitoylated and can regulate the nuclear localization of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp protein complex based on the palmitoylation status of r7bp  <cit> . in its palmitoylated form, r7bp anchors gβ <dig> protein complexes to the plasma membrane, and depalmitoylation of r7bp promotes translocation of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes to the nucleus via a polybasic nuclear localization signal  present near the c-terminus of r7bp  <cit> . these data invite further investigation into the nature of the membrane localization of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes.

to gain further insight into the effects of r7bp palmitoylation on the membrane targeting of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes we studied wild-type r7bp and the palmitoylation-deficient r7bp mutant proteins in transfected pc <dig> and hek- <dig> cells. pc <dig> cells have neuron-like features including the ability to synthesize dopamine and norepinephrine and to express receptors for nerve growth factor, while hek- <dig> have a non-neuronal phenotype. we report that gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes localize to lipid raft microdomains in membranes from both cell types and in adult mouse brain and that the palmitoylation status of r7bp appears to control such lipid raft association. together with recent evidence showing the regulatory effects of the gβ <dig> complex on gpcr signaling are greatly enhanced by r7bp palmitoylation and membrane anchoring  <cit> , our data suggests the targeting of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex to lipid rafts in neuronal cells may be critical for the g protein-directed function of the complex.

RESULTS
localization of endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> to lipid raft membrane domains in native pc <dig> cells requires palmitoylation
the recently discovered r7bp is a snare-like protein with twin c-terminal cysteine residues that are covalently modified by palmitoylation  <cit> . r7bp binds tightly to gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes and can regulate the subcellular distribution of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp protein complex based on its palmitoylation status  <cit> . the covalent fatty acylation of several signalling proteins with palmitate results promotes their targeting to lipid rafts, plasma membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids . such proteins include h-ras  <cit>  and certain dually acylated heterotrimeric g protein α subunits  <cit> .

the dual palmitoylation of r7bp would make it a candidate for lipid raft targeting and we therefore looked for evidence of such targeting by established biochemical methods using neuron-like pc <dig> cells as an initial model system. protein subunits encoding the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex components are expressed in pc <dig> cells but not in non-neuronal hela  or hek- <dig> cells  consistent with previous results  <cit> . in order to isolate lipid rafts we analyzed triton-x- <dig> solubilizates on discontinuous sucrose density gradients by ultracentrifugation. the low buoyant density of detergent-resistant membranes , which are aggregates of lipid rafts  <cit> , causes them to float towards the top of sucrose gradients while detergent-soluble proteins are distributed toward the bottom. in the discontinuous sucrose density gradient methodology employed here for cultured cells, we used established lipid raft markers including flotillin- <dig> and linker for activation of t cells    <cit> . another positive control for lipid raft isolation was the psd- <dig> protein . psd- <dig> is found in the brain localized to both synaptic lipid rafts and postsynaptic densities  <cit> , membrane compartments between which certain protein components may communicate  <cit> .

using the discontinuous sucrose density gradient analysis, we estimate that  <dig> to 20% of endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins in naïve pc <dig> cells are localized to the lipid raft fractions . the low-density peak of endogenous rgs <dig> and gβ <dig> proteins comigrates with the lat and psd- <dig> marker peaks in fractions  <dig> and  <dig> of the discontinuous sucrose gradient, comigrating also with the flotillin in fraction  <dig> just behind the peak of the flotillin marker in fraction  <dig>  the bulk of the gβ5/rgs <dig> proteins is found in the heavier sucrose fractions however, and comigrates with the na-k atpase β <dig> subunit marker used as a non-lipid raft negative control . overnight treatment of pc <dig> cells with 2-bromopalmitate to block palmitoylation of endogenous proteins prevented targeting of the native gβ5/rgs <dig> complex to the raft fractions, instead targeting the endogenous complex to the cell nucleus  , as previously demonstrated for transfected gβ5/rgs9-1/gfp-r7bp complexes  <cit> . taken together these results indicate that approximately  <dig> to 20% of endogenous gβ5/rgs <dig> protein complexes in naïve pc <dig> cells are localized to a type of lipid raft with buoyant density similar to the lipid rafts containing the palmitoylated marker proteins psd- <dig> and lat, but distinct from the membrane microdomain where flotillin is localized. the localization of the gβ5/rgs <dig> protein complex to the lipid raft fraction may require the palmitoylation of one or more endogenous proteins such as r7bp. in these experiments, the detection of endogenous r7bp in the sucrose gradient fractions from pc <dig> cells was not possible with the currently available antibodies due to the low levels of protein when diluted across the gradient.

the palmitoylation status of r7bp governs partitioning of the gβ5/r7-rgs complex to a triton-insoluble fraction in pc <dig> cells
the above results suggest that palmitoylation is required for the lipid raft targeting of native gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes but do not identify which palmitoylated protein may be necessary for such targeting. we first investigated the role of the palmitoylated anchor protein r7bp in targeting gβ5/r7-rgs protein complex to drms. to this end, we increased the expression level of r7bp by overexpressing either wild-type or mutant r7bp and checked their ability to interact with endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes and their subcellular localization. both wild-type r7bp and the previously described palmitoylation-deficient r7bp- c252s/c253s double mutant  were readily expressed in pc <dig> cells in n-terminal ha epitope tagged form   <cit> . immunoprecipitation of the transfected epitope-tagged r7bp constructs demonstrated their tight binding to, and co-immunoprecipitation with, endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> , consistent with previous reports employing non-palmitoylated r7bp mutants  <cit> . subcellular fractionation of pc <dig> cells transfected with r7bp or r7bp-ss demonstrated differential localization of the wild-type and mutant proteins. wild-type r7bp localized to the post-nuclear crude membrane fraction , while the r7bp-ss mutant localized predominantly to the cytosolic and nuclear fractions . in order to better define the subcellular targeting of transfected r7bp and r7bp-ss in pc <dig> cells, we further analyzed their expression by laser confocal microscopy . the wild-type r7bp expressed in transfected pc <dig> cells excluded the cell nuclei that were directly identified by counterstaining with hoechst reagent , consistent with the localization of endogenous r7bp in ng108- <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, the palmitoylation-deficient r7bp-ss mutant localized throughout the cells including the entire pc <dig> cell nucleus . these findings are consistent with the previously described subcellular localization of wild-type and non-palmitoylated r7bp mutant proteins expressed in cultured cells and neurons  <cit> .

because the insolubility of dually palmitoylated lipid raft-associated proteins in ice-cold triton x- <dig> has been used previously in pc <dig> cells to define and isolate lipid rafts  <cit> , we tested whether transfected r7bp could influence the distribution of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs proteins to these membrane microdomains. pc <dig> cells transfected with vector alone, ha-r7bp, or ha-r7bp-ss were extracted with cold triton x- <dig> and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions . immunoblotting showed that the transfected wild-type r7bp was found largely in the insoluble fraction while most of the r7bp-ss was soluble . furthermore while the bulk of the endogenous pc <dig> gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins were in the soluble fraction in the control and r7bp-ss transfected cells, some 40% of the endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> shifted to the triton-insoluble fraction when wild-type r7bp was transfected . no shift to the triton-insoluble fraction of α-tubulin, which is not a component of gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes with r7bp, was observed .

r7bp regulates the targeting of gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> to lipid raft membrane domains
the triton-insoluble pellet fraction contains aggregates of drms as well as non-raft associated detergent insoluble proteins  <cit> . to investigate whether the shift of endogenous of gβ5/r7-rgs complexes to the detergent-insoluble fraction resulting from overexpression of wild type r7bp in pc <dig> cells reflects a shift of the complex to lipid rafts, the distribution of ha-r7bp and endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins along a sucrose density gradient was determined . in control  transfected pc <dig> cells a peak of endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> was found in fractions  <dig> and  <dig> with the drms, while the vast majority of gβ5/rgs <dig> immunoreactivity was found in fractions 6– <dig> among non-raft proteins , similar to the results in native pc <dig> cells . approximately half of transfected wild-type r7bp migrates with the drms, and causes a major shift of endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins into fractions 1– <dig> as well . in contrast, transfected r7bp-ss was found in the heavier sucrose fractions with non-raft membrane protein markers and caused no shift of endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins into the drm fractions . these results were entirely consistent with the cold triton x- <dig> extraction data presented above and suggest the palmitoylation status of r7bp can govern the distribution of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes into or out of lipid raft membrane microdomains.

since neuron-like pc <dig> cells contain endogenous gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins  <cit> , we wondered whether the effect of r7bp on lipid raft targeting could be verified in a non-neuronal cell line in which the components of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes were re-constituted by transfection. for this reason we analyzed the distribution of transfected r7bp, gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> proteins in triton x- <dig> extracts along a sucrose density gradient in hek- <dig> cells . hek- <dig> cells were shown previously to lack significant expression of gβ <dig> mrna and protein  <cit> . as markers for drm and non-drm fractions in hek- <dig> cells, the migration of the dually acylated kinase fyn and the α <dig> subunit of na-k atpase, respectively, were determined by immunoblotting . transfection of au <dig> epitope-tagged gβ <dig> and rgs <dig>  without r7bp, resulted in no significant targeting of gβ5/rgs <dig> complexes to the drm fractions . on the other hand co-transfection of wild-type r7bp , but not the non-palmitoylated r7bp-ss mutant , with au5-gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> resulted in a shift of approximately 60% of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes to the drm fractions . when wild-type r7bp was employed, the peak of the low-density component of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex proteins was in fractions  <dig> and  <dig> of the hek- <dig> cell sucrose gradient , just as in pc <dig> cells. these findings show that, just as in neuronal pc <dig> cells that express the endogenous gβ <dig> complex, in hek- <dig> cells the palmitoylation status of r7bp can govern the distribution of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes into or out of lipid raft membrane microdomains.

endogenous mouse brain gβ <dig>  rgs <dig> and r7bp localize to lipid raft membrane domains
since the fraction of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes in neuron-like pc <dig> cells localized to the lipid rafts could be greatly increased by overexpression of wild-type r7bp, we investigated the localization of gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes in native brain where r7bp is most highly expressed  <cit> . because of the high lipid and protein content of brain compared to cultured cells, a different sucrose density gradient protocol was utilized, resulting in  <dig> fractions per gradient  <cit> . after extraction of drms from a synaptosomal fraction of mouse brain, we found that a readily detectable fraction of endogenous brain gβ5/rgs7/r7bp protein complexes localized to lipid raft fractions that comigrated with the flotillin marker . as in neuronal pc <dig> cells, the bulk of brain gβ5/rgs7/r7bp protein complexes distributed to the bottom gradient fractions where the non-raft protein transferrin receptor  marker is found . in this sucrose density gradient protocol there is large component of incompletely solubilized synaptosomes that is represented in fraction  <dig>  accounting for the heavy staining of marker and gβ5/rgs7/r7bp proteins in this fraction.

discussion
it has been proposed that lipid rafts provide a concentrating platform for the efficient interaction of certain receptors and other signaling proteins  <cit> . the recently discovered gβ5/r7-rgs anchoring protein r7bp, and its retinal paralog r9-anchoring protein, show structural similarity to the soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor  complex protein syntaxin  <cit> . snare complex proteins including syntaxin are highly enriched in lipid rafts  <cit> . furthermore the dual palmitoylation of r7bp makes it a logical candidate for lipid raft targeting, given that the covalent fatty acylation of several signalling proteins with palmitate promotes their targeting to lipid rafts, including dually acylated heterotrimeric g protein α subunits  <cit> . the data presented here demonstrate that indeed the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex associates with lipid rafts in native pc <dig> cells and mouse brain, and that targeting to these liquid-ordered membrane microdomains is supported by the wild-type, but not the non-palmitoylated mutant form of r7bp.

the present work shows that some 10–30% of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes are lipid raft-associated in native pc <dig> cells and brain. the data presented here suggest that r7bp and its palmitoylation status are the major determinants of the lipid raft association of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes. however, since a previous report found no significant association of rgs <dig> with lipid rafts in bovine brain membranes  <cit> , it seems possible that additional signal besides palmitoylation may be required to enhance the lipid raft targeting of the gβ5/r7-rgs complex in native membranes. in photoreceptors for example the paralogous complex in the outer segments containing the retina-specific isoforms of gβ <dig> and rgs <dig> undergoes a dramatic shift to the lipid raft membrane fraction only upon illumination, the external signal that initiates the phototransduction cascade  <cit> . by analogy with the retinal system, it may be that yet-to-be-identified external signal regulate the concerted movement of neuronal gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes to lipid rafts. the partitioning of these complexes to lipid rafts under basal conditions may be minimal.

the range of signal that may control gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex subcellular localization and function is currently unknown. a recent study by song and coworkers showed the importance of the r7bp c-terminal domain in the targeting gβ5-rgs9- <dig> complexes to the plasma membrane and the nucleus, and demonstrated that a significant fraction of gβ5/rgs9- <dig> is found in neuronal postsynaptic densities   <cit> . the neuronal scaffolding protein psd- <dig>  though first identified and named for its association with psd, is also highly enriched in rat brain synaptosomal lipid raft fractions  <cit> , consistent with our results here showing that gβ5/r7-rgs complexes comigrate with psd- <dig> and lat in the lipid raft fraction of pc <dig> extracts. the study by song and coworkers did not address the localization of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes to lipid rafts  <cit> . nevertheless the likelihood of functional connection between lipid rafts and psd in the postsynaptic region of neurons makes the co-localization of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes to both lipid rafts and psd a distinct possibility  <cit> .

while the possible biological significance of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex targeting to lipid rafts is presently unknown, strong clues can be assembled from currently available evidence. the most likely physiological target of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex gtpase activating protein  activity, heterotrimeric gαo  <cit> , is acylated by both myristate and palmitate and is lipid raft-associated  <cit> . recent studies in xenopus laevis oocytes showed the regulatory effect of the gβ <dig> complex on gαi/o-coupled m <dig> muscarinic receptor signaling, typical of rgs protein-mediated gαi/o-directed gap action, was greatly enhanced by r7bp palmitoylation  <cit> . furthermore the functional enhancement of r7bp due to palmitoylation in this pathway was a result of its membrane anchoring  <cit> . in light of these findings, our data suggest the targeting of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex to lipid rafts in neurons and brain, where g proteins and their effectors are concentrated, may be central to the g protein regulatory function of the complex.

CONCLUSIONS
in both neuron-like pc <dig> cells and mouse brain, a fraction of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp protein complexes is targeted to low-density, detergent-resistant membrane lipid rafts. in cultured pc <dig> and hek- <dig> cells, the palmitoylation status of r7bp regulated the lipid raft targeting of endogenous or co-expressed gβ5/r7-rgs proteins. taken together with recent evidence that the kinetic effects of the gβ <dig> complex on gpcr signaling are greatly enhanced by r7bp palmitoylation through a membrane-anchoring mechanism, our data suggest the targeting of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex to lipid rafts in neurons and brain, where g proteins and their effectors are concentrated, may be central to the g protein regulatory function of the complex.
