BACKGROUND
whole genome sequencing  has revolutionised the detailed interrogation of mycobacterial genomes at base-pair resolution. application of this technology has provided novel insights into the evolution of members of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex . more recently, wgs has been applied to investigate the evolution of drug resistance based on the hypothesis that additional mutational events may precede or occur concurrently with known resistance conferring mutations . a number of recent studies have assessed the genomic stability of m. tuberculosis during the evolution of drug resistance   <cit> , producing diametrically opposed results. some studies have demonstrated genomic stability  <cit> , while more recent reports have shown genomic instability with the emergence of additional genetic variants independent of those observed in drug target genes conferring resistance . various studies have demonstrated the acquisition of known resistance conferring mutations in the m. tuberculosis genome during the course of infection and subsequent drug treatment. this highlights the potential of m. tuberculosis to diversify and adapt under selective pressure  <cit> . in other work, wgs analysis of serially collected sputum samples of tuberculosis  patients provided overwhelming evidence of the presence of drug resistant sub-populations  <cit> . this study emphasised the need to investigate the implications of inter- and intra-host m. tuberculosis genetic diversity for transmission and disease outcomes  <cit> . the presence of drug resistant sub-populations is a major concern when considering the variable sensitivity of standard genetic and microbiological tests for the diagnosis of drug resistance m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

it is important to note that the identification of sub-populations within the context of wgs is dependent on the read frequency cut-off values used in the standard variant filtering approach. typically, these frequency cut-off values are set at >70 %, implying that only variants fixed within a population are identified i.e. variants present at only >70 % of the sequencing reads are analysed  <cit> . failure to adjust these algorithms to accommodate for the presence of low-frequency sub-populations has led authors to conclude that the population structure of m. tuberculosis is homogeneous  <cit> . by using an alternative variant calling approach  a recent study demonstrated the rapid expansion and collapse of different sub-populations that evolved in parallel during the evolution of extensively drug resistant   <cit> . however, while wgs is increasingly being used to investigate drug resistance and evolution in m. tuberculosis, there is still uncertainty surrounding the error rate of sequencing, read alignment and the detection of variants. in an age where wgs is increasingly relied on for defining the structure of bacterial genomes, it is important to investigate the reliability of next-generation sequencing reads where a variant is only present in a minor percentage of the sequencing reads. this therefore questions the threshold at which underlying populations, as indicated by the percentage of sequencing reads supporting a variant allele, can be confirmed as true variants as opposed to sequencing errors.

this study aimed to define a reliable cut-off for identification of heterogeneous variants from wgs data. subsequently this cut-off was used to investigate: 1) heterogeneity in single colonies isolated from  <dig> rifampicin mono-resistant m. tuberculosis clinical isolates, and 2) the evolution of isoniazid resistance in rifampicin mono-resistant isolates in  <dig> patients.

RESULTS
strains were initially selected on the basis of clinical diagnostic records, then subjected to further analysis to confirm their resistance profiles and strain genotypes. phenotypic drug resistance testing of the parental isolates  and their associated single colonies  confirmed the rifampicin mono-resistant profile in all cases. as expected, all isolates carried a mutation in the rpob gene; genotyping of parental isolates identified one of the following mutations in the rpob gene: ser531leu, his526tyr or leu533pro . these mutations were retained in the corresponding single colonies after selection on agar plates containing rifampicin. is <dig> genotyping and spoligotyping revealed that the rifampicin mono-resistant isolates originated from different genetic backgrounds , representing the broad strain diversity circulating in the western cape, south africa. genotyping by is <dig> also showed that the parental isolates and single colonies were identical, confirming the absence of mixed infection.table  <dig> genotypic characterisation of m. tuberculosis clinical isolates used for the investigation into genomic heterogeneity

identifying a reliable cut-off to detect genomic heterogeneity
to define a reliable cut-off for heterogeneous variant detection, we employed a combination of wgs and statistical analyses of parental isolates and their associated single colonies. single colonies were obtained by plating serial dilutions of the parental isolate onto 7h <dig> agar containing 2 μg/ml rif. two to three single colonies isolated from each of the  <dig> parental rifampicin mono-resistant m. tuberculosis isolates  were selected and subjected to wgs analysis. this analysis of  <dig> single colonies revealed the presence of a total of  <dig> possible sequence variants between corresponding single colonies using m. tuberculosis h37rv as the alignment standard. to determine whether a variant which was present in less than 100 % of the reads reflected the presence of either genetically distinct subpopulations or sequencing artefacts,  <dig> of the  <dig> possible variants were selected for validation by sanger sequencing . all  <dig> variants present in ≥ <dig>  % of the reads were verified with a single chromatogram peak demonstrating that only the dominant nucleotide was detected. in addition,  <dig> variants present in between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the reads were also determined to contain two nucleotides indicated by the presence of two chromatogram peaks. of the  <dig> variants with a read frequency between  <dig>  and  <dig>  %,  <dig> were shown to be false positives as only a single chromatogram peak was observed. we investigated the frequency of the  <dig> false positive variants across all of the single colonies as recurrence of these variants in other genomes might suggest that the false variants were called due to mapping errors. only one of the  <dig> variants  was found to be recurrent and identified in  <dig> of the single colonies.table  <dig> validation of variants with a read frequency ranging between  <dig> and 100 % using targeted pcr and sanger sequencing

we performed a receiver operator characteristic  curve analysis to define a reliable cut-off for the identification of true heterogeneous variants. roc curve analysis disproved the null hypothesis, with an area under the curve  of  <dig>  . a cut-off value of 30 % read frequency was defined with a true positive value of  <dig>  and a false positive value of  <dig>  i.e. a true positive rate of  <dig>  % and a false positive rate of  <dig>  % . using the conventional cut-off value of 70 % there would be a true positive rate of  <dig>  % and a false positive rate of 0 %. accordingly, we defined a cut off for the description of true heterogeneity at a defined nucleotide position as ≥30 % i.e. if a variant identified in at least 30 % of the illumina sequencing reads , it is likely that the variant is truly present within the genome of a sub-population of bacilli. using this analysis we also defined a variant with a read frequency of greater than 70 % to be fixed within a population.fig.  <dig> validation of variants identified by illumina sequencing. analysis of sanger sequencing alignments and corresponding chromatograms was used to validate the presence of homo- and heterogeneous variants identified by illumina sequencing. variants present in either the sequencing file or in the chromatogram  were scored as true variants while sequences which remained wild-type were scored as false

we next applied the ≥30 % variant frequency cut-off value to assess genomic heterogeneity within and between individual colonies. using this cut-off value this analysis  <dig> of single colonies revealed the presence of a total of  <dig> possible sequence variants between corresponding single colonies using m. tuberculosis h37rv as the alignment standard. from the  <dig> possible variants,  <dig> were found to have a read frequency of greater than 70 %, while  <dig> were found to have a read frequency of between  <dig> and 70 % ). the number of variants identified was independent of the strain background, and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in different clinical isolates. importantly, genomic heterogeneity was observed both within single colonies  and between single colonies isolated from one parent.table  <dig> variants identified in corresponding single colonies derived from different clinical isolates

comparing single colonies and the entire population isolated from sputum
wgs data was available for four of the parental m. tuberculosis isolates used to make the single colonies. therefore, to determine whether the single colonies reflected the genetic heterogeneity of the parent isolate, we compared the wgs of the single colonies from four rifampicin mono-resistant m. tuberculosis clinical isolates to the sequences of their corresponding parent population . as shown in fig.  <dig> this comparison identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> variants that were unique to the single colonies relative to the parental genomes for r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively. these variants were shared between all of the single colonies cultured from their corresponding parental isolates. in addition, the individual single colonies also harboured unique variants that were absent in the corresponding parental isolates as well as absent in the other related single colonies. conversely, the parental isolates also each harboured unique variants that were absent in all corresponding single colonies . together these results suggest that all of the genomic variants identified as unique to the single colonies were masked by the dominant population present in the parent isolates.fig.  <dig> genetic diversity between parental populations and their corresponding single colonies. a the r <dig> parental population had  <dig> unique variants relative to all three colonies. while all three colonies shared  <dig> variants which were unique to the colonies relative to the parental population, each colony also harboured unique variants relative to the other colonies. similarly, for  the r <dig> parental population had  <dig> unique variants relative to all three colonies. while all three colonies only shared  <dig> variants, each colony also harboured unique variants relative to the other colonies.  for r <dig>  the parental population had  <dig> unique variant relative to both colonies, while the colonies shared  <dig> variants which were unique relative to the parental population. similarly, the two colonies for r <dig>  shared  <dig> variants which were unique relative to the parental population. the r <dig> parental population had  <dig> unique variant relative to the other colonies



intra-patient evolution of drug resistance
having established the utility of our analytical approach in identifying inter- and intra-isolate variation, we next went on to analyse genome heterogeneity during the evolution of drug resistance. here, we analysed mdr isolates  collected approximately  <dig> and 11 months after the rifampicin mono-resistant isolates r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively . we investigated the heterogeneity of snps across the genome of the rifampicin mono-resistant and mdr entire populations relative to the m. tuberculosis h37rv reference genome. we subsequently compared this list of snps between the rifampicin mono-resistant and mdr isolates to identify variants unique to each isolate as well as the evolutionary events associated with the emergence of drug  resistance .table  <dig>

for patient  <dig> numerous heterogeneous variants were identified in the rifampicin mono-resistant isolate, r <dig>  while there were no heterogeneous variants observed in the follow-up mdr isolate, r <dig> . since the primary difference between these two isolates is the presence of a katg mutation , these results suggest that the heterogeneous variants present in r <dig> were ‘lost’ during the acquisition of isoniazid resistance. patient  <dig> shows contrasting results: the rifampicin mono-resistant isolate, r <dig>  was shown to have no heterogeneous variants while its follow-up mdr isolate, r <dig>  harboured  <dig> . the variants shown to be unique to r <dig> were all present at a variant frequency of greater than 70 %. interestingly, two variants shown to be fixed within the rifampicin mono-resistant population, with a variant frequency of 100 %, were found to be present at a lower frequency within the mdr population . this finding indicates that two fixed variants in r <dig> may have been lost in r <dig>  these results revealed the acquisition and loss of numerous heterogeneous variants , suggesting continuous genome evolution despite the evolutionary bottle neck imposed by the isoniazid selective pressure.fig.  <dig> heterogeneous positions identified across the whole population genomes relative to m. tuberculosis h37rv reference genome. athe rifampicin mono-resistant isolate  for patient  <dig> shows numerous heterogeneous variants relative to m. tuberculosis h37rv while the follow-up mdr isolate  has none.  for patient  <dig> the rifampicin mono-resist isolate  showed no heterogeneous variants relative to m. tuberculosis h37rv, while the follow-up mdr isolate  had numerous heterogeneous variants. r <dig> shared  <dig> variants  with r <dig>  where the variant was present at 100 % in r <dig> but was a heterogeneous variant in r1210



finally, we compared the wgs data of mdr isolates to the single colonies generated from the rifampicin mono-resistant parental isolates. this comparison failed to identify any of the single colony specific genomic variants in the mdr isolate.

discussion
our study aimed to use wgs in combination with sanger sequencing and statistical analyses to define a reliable cut-off for heterogeneous variant detection. our data enabled us to define a read frequency cut off of 30 % for reliable illumina sequencing variant frequency filtering i.e. a variant present in 30 % or more of the sequencing reads can be considered to be a true variant and not a sequencing error. at a variant frequency of 30 % there is a true positive of  <dig>  % and a false positive rate of  <dig>  %. we acknowledge that there is still a chance that true variants at a frequency lower than 30 % may be missed due to the limited resolution of sanger sequencing. for the purpose of our analyses we regard it of greater importance to exclude false positives from our analyses than to omit a small amount of true positives. however, we do not exclude the probability that this cut-off value may change with increased sequence read depth. higher depth of coverage would however not limit the detection of false positive variants as the  <dig> false positive variants identified in this study were not associated with lower mean genome coverage. furthermore, by defining a cut-off it allowed us to use a relaxed variant filtering approach to investigate the presence of sub-populations in m. tuberculosis clinical isolates.

using our cut-off of 30 % variant frequency we investigated the genomic heterogeneity within and between individual single colonies isolated from rifampicin mono-resistant m. tuberculosis clinical isolates. to our knowledge this is the first study that has investigated m. tuberculosis genomic diversity within single colonies from a clinical sample at a single time point. we observed a high rate of genetic diversity between single colonies isolated from the same parental isolate. we acknowledge that the analysis of only two to three single colonies for each patient isolate would have limited the anlaysis of the true heterogeneity in the total population. we also acknowledge that the selection of these single colonies on media containing rifampicin would have resulted in the loss of variants representing rifampicin susceptible colonies. this high rate of genetic diversity seen in our study is in concordance with previous studies that used relaxed filtering with regards to variant frequency  <cit> . sun et al. showed that there can be as many as  <dig>  variants between serial sputum samples, with  <dig>  % of all the variants at frequencies lower than 20 %   <cit> . a study by bryant et al. showed seemingly contrasting results using the same filtering approach to investigate relapse and reinfection cases  <cit> . using a minimum read depth of  <dig> and read frequency higher than 5 %, little genetic diversity was observed in the relapse cases. however any heterogeneous positions identified were discarded as mapping errors and no validation by sanger sequencing was done. this may have led to an underestimation of the number of variants, a possibility highlighted by our findings that heterogeneous variants occurring between  <dig> and 70 % frequency are likely to be truly present within a population.

our findings which showed the extent of diversity between parental isolates and their respective single colonies are in agreement with a recent study where in vitro generated mutants were compared to their drug susceptible progenitor  <cit> . numerous variants only present in a proportion of the illumina reads were identified to be unique to the parental genome. similar to our findings the authors showed that in some daughter cells the mutant allele was lost while in others it was retained  <cit> . this suggests that single colonies may not be a true reflection of the genomic diversity of a clinical m. tuberculosis isolate. in contrast, wgs of an entire population may underestimate the extent of genetic diversity present in a clinical isolate given the complexity of the m. tuberculosis population structure. however, improved read depths may allow for identification of underlying populations which were undetectable in this study. the high degree of genetic diversity seen in this study is similar to that reported elsewhere  <cit>  and is unlikely to have arisen as a consequence of laboratory adaptations. the number of culturing steps was kept to a minimum and previous wgs data from in vitro generated mutants in our laboratory showed very little genetic diversity . this is supported by wgs of six m. tuberculosis h37rv strains from multiple laboratories that showed little change after years of repeated sub-culturing, suggesting genomic stability during in vitro culture  <cit> .

our results show that single colonies may not be a true reflection of the genetic diversity present within a clinical isolate and vice versa. this finding may have important implications for genomic epidemiology since a recent study by didelot et al.  demonstrated the use of wgs to infer person to person transmission. underlying populations masked by dominant variants may not truly be represented in the above method and may therefore be overlooked when interpreting person to person transmission  <cit> . therefore, this study highlights the importance of the methods of storage used for m. tuberculosis isolates. the diversity seen i) within a clinical isolate and ii) between single colonies isolated from a single m. tuberculosis clinical isolate needs to be taken into consideration. storage of samples should therefore be carefully considered based on the research questions which may be asked in future studies. numerous studies have stated that single colonies were isolated from lj slants for storage and further use , while other studies use clinical isolates as a whole representative population  <cit> . these different approaches may impact results obtained and conclusions drawn.

having shown genetic diversity between parental populations and their single colonies, as well as diversity between single colonies isolated from the same progenitor, we next investigated the evolution of isoniazid resistance in m. tuberculosis clinical isolates within two patients. initial investigation into genetic heterogeneity in both rifampicin mono-resistant and mdr isolates relative to m. tuberculosis h37rv revealed that there were numerous heterogeneous variants present within the genome. for patient  <dig>  the rifampicin mono-resistant isolate harboured numerous heterogeneous variants, all of which were unique to this isolate when compared to its paired mdr isolate. during the acquisition of the katg isoniazid resistance causing mutation all of these heterogeneous variants were lost from the population. this finding suggested that the isoniazid selective pressure imposed an evolutionary bottleneck, resulting in a purification effect and the loss of heterogeneous variants. contrasting results were observed for patient  <dig>  as the  <dig> apparently fixed snps were lost during the acquisition of the inha promoter isoniazid resistance causing mutation. once again, this finding suggests that isoniazid selective pressure imposed an evolutionary bottleneck. the paired mdr isolate, r <dig>  showed a total of  <dig> heterogeneous variants to be unique to this isolate when compared to r <dig>  two of which were fixed within the population of r <dig>  this suggests that these two variants were reverting to wild type, while other variants were emerging within the population. these findings highlight the continuous genome evolution occurring after an evolutionary bottleneck is imposed on a population. the m. tuberculosis isolates from each patient represent two different strain lineages, namely beijing and eai, suggesting that genetic diversity observed during the evolution of isoniazid resistance is not limited to one lineage. the mdr isolates were collected approximately  <dig> and 11 months after the initial rifampicin mono-resistant samples were collected from patients’  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. unfortunately, clinical information such as treatment regimens and treatment adherence was not available to us at the time of the study, limiting our ability to draw conclusions regarding mutation rates and selective pressure.

the loss of an rpoc polymorphism from the rifampicin mono-resistant isolate from patient  <dig>  further highlights the importance of selective pressure on defining the genetic population of m. tuberculosis. a proportion of 30 % of the r <dig> population  contained an rpoc mutation while there was no rpoc mutation present in the follow-up mdr isolate . while variants in the rpoc gene have been speculated to be putative compensatory mutations  <cit> , this mutation may not be important for survival since the selective purification for isoniazid resistance causing mutations resulted in the loss of this putative compensatory mutation. no additional compensatory mutations were identified in the wgs data for the isolates used in this study.

complementary to our findings are the results observed in a recent study by eldholm et al. where it was shown that the amount of variation between serial isolates from a single patient may be higher than that observed between two patients in a transmission chain  <cit> . in addition they observed numerous snps within the mycobacterial population which occurred concurrently with drug resistance causing mutations, which were termed ‘hitchhiking snps’. excluding these ‘hitchhiking snps’ from their analyses, the amount of variation between sequential samples decreased, suggesting that the selective pressure of drug exposure resulted in a purifying effect. based on these observations the authors concluded that the presence of populations with high genetic diversity  facilitated the emergence of drug resistance, and that selective pressure may be a driving force in longitudinal genetic diversity  <cit> . similarly, a recent study by bergval et al. hypothesised that a selection event may result in the fixation of either a wild-type or mutant allele which was originally present in only a sub-population of m. tuberculosis isolates  <cit> .

based on our findings and others’ work, we propose a model to explain the effect of a selection bottleneck and random mutations on the population structure of m. tuberculosis clinical isolates . we hypothesise that during the course of infection numerous genetic mutations arise within a mycobacterial population and in response to a selective pressure such as antibiotic exposure, clones with pre-existing drug resistant mutations are selected. cells within the population harbouring drug resistant causing mutations survive while drug sensitive cells die. during this process numerous genetic mutations are lost from the population while mutations which occur concurrently with drug resistance causing mutations  remain  <cit> . the presence of a selective pressure therefore creates a selection bottleneck, altering the level of genetic diversity within the mycobacterial population. subsequent growth and the emergence of new snps allow for an increase in genetic diversity once again . this subsequent increase in genetic diversity post selective pressure is substantiated by our findings that a rifampicin mono-resistant isolate and its paired mdr isolate each have numerous unique genetic differences i.e. polymorphisms are lost from the original rifampicin mono-resistant population, while different polymorphisms emerge in the mdr isolate.fig.  <dig> proposed model for the effect of a selection bottleneck and random mutations on the population structure of m. tuberculosis clinical isolates. a a rifampicin mono-resistant clinical m. tuberculosis isolate where each cell comprising the population contains an rpob mutation. numerous other genetic mutations are present thereby creating a diverse population structure.  following the onset of treatment the genetic mutations in the population may change, and a spontaneous isoniazid resistance causing  mutation is selected for and becomes dominant within the population.  selective pressure of treatment results in the emergence of an isoniazid resistant m. tuberculosis population where each cell contains a katg mutation. numerous other genetic mutations are lost during the selection bottleneck resulting in a loss of genetic diversity.  subsequent replication cycles and population growth results in new genetic mutations arising within the population allowing for new diversification e.g. r <dig>  each cell in this mdr population retains the rpob and katg resistance causing mutations. key: x denotes an isoniazid resistance causing mutation 



CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated two key aspects involved in the use of next-generation wgs. firstly, we investigated the confidence in the validity of variants called during bioinformatics analysis. secondly, we investigated the difference in outputs when utilising a relaxed variant filtering approach compared to the standard filtering approach.

to our knowledge this is the first study that has investigated m. tuberculosis genomic diversity using single colonies isolated from clinical isolates. the surprisingly high rate of genetic diversity seen in our study is in concordance with previous studies that used a relaxed variant filtering approaches  <cit> . during the evolution of drug resistance we observed the emergence and disappearance of numerous variants within a population. our findings allowed us to formulate a model for the selective bottleneck which occurs during the course of infection, acting as a genomic purification event. subsequent post-bottleneck mycobacterial growth allows for new genetic diversification to occur. this proposed increase in diversity suggests that the genome is preparing to respond to a changing environment.
