BACKGROUND
when t cells encounter antigen-presenting cells  loaded with a peptide that they specifically recognize, they mature to become effector cells  <cit> . there are three major sub-populations of effector cells. type one  cells secrete ifnγ, il- <dig> and tnfβ and mediate a systemic cellular immune response, through the activation of macrophages and cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . type two  cells secrete il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and potentiate the isotype switching of immunoglobulins to igg <dig> and ige, promoting neutralizing activity and degranulation of mast cells, thereby inducing a barrier immunity  <cit> . the type  <dig>  cells, recently described, produce il-17a and f, g-csf and the chemokines cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  it promotes life and differentiation of neutrophils and is important in the clearance of extracellular bacteria  <cit> . naïve cells can also differentiate into regulatory cells, either th <dig> , tr <dig>  or itreg   <cit> . differentiation of cells into t <dig> or t <dig> effector cells has been shown mostly to occur in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, although other immune cells also differentiate into these two patterns  <cit> .

the clone-specific t cell response is provided by signals from the t cell receptor . yet additional signals, provided by cytokines and by co-receptors, are also required for the activation and for the determination of the cytokine profile of t cells. thus, a lymphocyte senses not only the presence of an antigen but also its environment and a particular cellular response will result from the integration of signals delivered by the antigen – specific receptor and the numerous co-receptors and cytokine receptors  <cit> .

the initial signals of differentiation can occur in the absence of cytokines  <cit> . the stabilization of the differentiated phenotype, however, is thought to depend mostly on cytokines  <cit> . the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> play a direct role in the differentiation of lymphocytes into the t <dig> or t <dig> patterns, respectively. when activated t cells are cultured in the presence of il- <dig> and blocking antibodies against il- <dig>  they differentiate into the t <dig> pattern. in the same way, activated cells cultured in the presence of il- <dig> and blocking antibodies against ifnγ differentiate into t <dig> cells  <cit> . an extensive amount of work has documented the direct involvement of cytokines in the in vivo differentiation of t cells into the t <dig> or t <dig> patterns  <cit> .

cd <dig> is a very large and heavily glycosylated molecule, very abundant on the t cell surface  <cit> . it was originally proposed that its main function was to repulse the interactions between the apc and the t cell, because of its strong negative charge due to the abundance of sialic acid, and extended nature  <cit> . in addition, during the rearrangement of molecules that accompanies antigen – specific t cell activation, cd <dig> is excluded from the t-cell – apc contact region, which contains the tcr, as well as other co-receptor molecules  <cit> . cd <dig> exclusion from the immunological synapses is an active phenomenon, which gives rise to the formation of a distal complex, probably with signalling activity  <cit> . even so, the presence of the extracellular domain of cd <dig> in the contact area between the apc and the t cell does not affect the t cell response  <cit> . furthermore, cd <dig> mediates its own signalling events and cooperates with those mediated by the tcr in t cell priming, as determined in total populations of t cells  <cit> .

we evaluated the role of cd <dig> signals, alone or combined with tcr or il- <dig> signals on: a) the expression of ifnγ and il- <dig>  b) the transcription of t-bet and gata- <dig> genes, c) the membrane expression of il-12r and ifnγr and d) the distribution of ifnγr and the tcr on the surface of human t cells. our results show that cd <dig> signals promote t cell commitment to the t <dig> differentiation pattern in adult t cells, particularly the cd4+ subset.

RESULTS
cd <dig> signals induce ifnγ gene expression
we evaluated the role of cd <dig> signals in the commitment of human cd4+ and cd8+ t cells into ifnγ producers. in freshly isolated cells, cd <dig> – ligation induced a modest change in the percentage of ifnγ+ cells in cd4+ but not in cd8+ t cells. engagement of the tcr led to a substantial increase in the percentage of ifnγ+ cells both in the cd4+ and cd8+ t cell populations. the simultaneous ligation of cd <dig> and the tcr strongly increased the proportion of ifnγ+ cd4+ t cells, but not that of cd8+ t cells . the cd <dig> plus tcr induced increase in ifnγ+ cd4+ t cells is accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in il-4+ cells .

next, we evaluated the effect of cd <dig> signals on cells differentiated for one week under t <dig> or t <dig> polarizing conditions   <cit> . in t <dig> cells, cd <dig> or the tcr independently were sufficient to induce the expression of ifnγ in cd4+ t cells , and to a lower extent in cd8+ cells . in the t <dig> effector cells, cd <dig>  but not the tcr, induced the expression of ifnγ, in both cd4+ and cd8+ cells . these results indicate that in cd4+ human t cells, cd <dig> signals induce a t <dig> cytokine pattern. in freshly isolated cells, cd <dig> signals require in addition signals from the tcr but not in either t <dig> or t <dig> differentiated cells. furthermore, in t <dig> differentiated cd8+ t cells, cd <dig>  but not the tcr, signals induced the expression of ifnγ. a significant increase in ifnγ expression was also observed in response to the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr in freshly isolated cells depleted of cd45ro+  cells and in human neonatal t cells .

in freshly isolated cd4+ t cells, the increase in the percentage of ifnγ+ cells in response to cd <dig> signals correlated with a decrease of il-4+ cells . we thus investigated the effect of cd <dig> signals in the transcription of the ifnγ and il- <dig> genes . in cd4+ t cells, the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr strongly induced ifnγ gene transcription . neither cd <dig> nor the tcr signals alone were sufficient to induce ifnγ gene transcription. alone or in combination, cd <dig> and the tcr were inhibitory of basal il- <dig> transcription . in cd8+ cells, cd <dig> signals did not affect the transcription of either the ifnγ or il- <dig> genes  yet those of the tcr induced ifnγ transcription with no change in il- <dig> mrna levels. the joint signals from cd <dig> and the tcr stimulated il- <dig> transcription over the levels found in response to tcr signals, consistent with the fact that in cd8+ cells, the combination of cd43- and tcr-dependent signals did not result in a higher proportion of infγ+ cells . cd <dig> expression was similar in all the populations of cells, as evaluated by l <dig> staining .

effect of cd <dig> signals in the transcription of the t-bet and gata- <dig> genes
differentiation into effector t cells is accompanied by the selective expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. t-bet and gata- <dig> have been described as the signature transcription factors for differentiation of t <dig> and t <dig> cells, respectively  <cit> . although cd <dig> signals alone had no effect on the transcription of t-bet or gata- <dig> genes, in cooperation with those of the tcr, led to a marked inhibition of the gata- <dig> gene transcription in both, cd4+ or cd8+ t cells . moreover, in cd4+ t cells, the combined signals of cd <dig> and the tcr induced the transcription of the t-bet gene . the cd43-mediated increase in t-bet and inhibition of gata- <dig> genes transcription, could direct cd4+ t cell differentiation into the t <dig> pattern.

cd <dig> ligation increased the expression of il- <dig> and ifnγ receptor
cytokine expression depends on signals from co-receptors as well as from cytokines. upon interaction with their receptors, il- <dig> and ifnγ induce t1- and il- <dig> t2-differentiation patterns  <cit> . we investigated the effects of signals from the tcr, cd <dig> and il- <dig> in the membrane-expression levels of il- <dig>  and ifnγ  receptors in cd4+ t cells. il-12r and ifnγr are expressed at low levels in non-stimulated cd4+ t cells  <cit> . cd43-ligation, but not that of the tcr, induced an increase in the percentage of il-12r+ or ifnγr+ cells. as expected, the il- <dig> signals augmented the percentage of il-12r+ and ifnγr+ cells .

il- <dig> signals augment the induction of ifnγ in response to cd <dig> and tcr signals in cd4+ t cells
we next investigated if cd <dig> signals affected the il-12-driven transcription of ifnγ in cd4+ t cells. the individual signals from cd <dig> or the tcr did not alter the il-12-induced ifnγ transcription. the combination of cd <dig>  the tcr and il- <dig> signals led, however, to a 20% increase of the ifnγ gene transcription over that resulting of the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr . this enhancement was also reflected at the protein level, because the percentage of ifnγ+ cells increased when il- <dig> was added together with anti-tcr and anti-cd <dig> mabs . as expected, il- <dig> signals induced ifnγ transcription. these results suggest that cd43-mediated signals favour the il-12-driven differentiation into t <dig> cells.

cd <dig> signals induce the co-clustering of ifnγr and the tcr
the membrane distribution of ifnγr and the tcr has been shown to determine the effector phenotype of lymphocytes. when il- <dig> is present during activation, the co-capping of the tcr and ifnγr gives rise to a t <dig> differentiation pattern  <cit> . we found that in cd4+ t cells, the tcr and ifnγr always co-localized, whether the cells were stimulated or not . the separate signals of cd <dig>  the tcr and il- <dig> all induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells with tcr and ifnγr co-clustering . the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr increased this percentage over that resulting of the individual stimuli. addition of il- <dig> simultaneous with cd <dig> and tcr ligation did not augment the proportion of cells with co-clustered receptors over that found for cd43- or cd43- and tcr-treated cells. the addition of il- <dig> to tcr-ligated cells, however, augmented the proportion of cells with co-clustered receptors as related to tcr-ligated cells .

cd4+ t cells were left non-stimulated or were stimulated for  <dig> h by antibody ligation of the tcr, cd <dig>  or the simultaneous ligation of both molecules, in the presence or absence of il- <dig> or il- <dig>  cells were stained with fitc-labelled anti-cd <dig> and pe-labelled anti-ifnγr antibodies and analyzed with a fluorescent microscope. for each treatment we counted  <dig> cells and determined the percentage of cells with co-clustered receptors over those with an even distribution of receptors. statistical significance was evaluated by the student t test. differences were significant with p <  <dig>  for cd <dig>  the tcr or il- <dig> signals as compared with non-stimulated cells and p <  <dig>  for the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr as compared with anti-cd <dig> or anti-cd <dig>  the addition of il- <dig> to the antibody treated cells resulted in a significant difference only for the anti-tcr treatment . il- <dig> significantly inhibited the co-clustering of the ifnγr and the tcr in all the antibodies treatments .

the localization and topography of the tcr and ifnγr clusters also changed in response to the different stimuli. in il-12-treated cells, both receptors redistributed towards one half of the cell in a few big clusters . cd <dig> signalling resulted in smaller clusters all over the cells or towards one pole , whereas the joint signals from cd <dig> and il- <dig>  or of cd <dig> and the tcr  promoted the formation of a co-cap of the tcr and ifnγr in one extreme of the cells. no further effect was observed as a result of the combined signals of cd <dig>  the tcr and il- <dig> . signals from the tcr alone induced the redistribution of the tcr and ifnγr towards one half of the cell, and the addition of il- <dig> did not change the phenotype . in cd8+ t cells, the tcr and ifnγr did not co-localize and cd <dig> signals did not affect the aggregation of either receptor 

finally, we examined whether il- <dig> signals disrupted the tcr and ifnγr co-clustering. in murine cells, it has been shown that il- <dig> signals inhibit the co-clustering of the tcr and ifnγr and that, as a consequence, cells differentiate into t <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with this, il- <dig> signals inhibited the redistribution of receptors resulting from il- <dig>  cd <dig> or tcr engagement alone or in different combinations .

discussion
we evaluated the effect of cd <dig> signals alone or in combination with those of the tcr on ifnγ expression in freshly isolated cd4+ or cd8+ t cells and in t <dig> or t <dig> effector cells. in freshly isolated cd4+ t cells, cd <dig> signals alone led to a small increase in the percentage of ifnγ+ cells, and synergized with tcr signals in the induction of ifnγ+ cells. this was not observed in cd8+ t cells stimulated under the same experimental conditions. on effector cells, cd <dig> signals alone lead to a strong induction of ifnγ not only in t <dig> but also in t <dig> cd4+ cells and to a lower extent in cd8+ cells. these data suggest a specific role of cd <dig> signals in ifnγ expression.

the biology, function and distribution of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells during an immune response are different. we found that cd8+ t cells are less responsive to cd43-dependent signals. a differential response of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells to co-receptors has also been observed for the tnf family co-receptors, 4-1bb and ox <dig>  4-1bb preferentially activates cd8+ cells, and inhibits of cd4+ t cells. conversely, ox <dig> is mainly stimulatory for cd4+ t cells  <cit> . the differences encountered between cd4+ and cd8+ t cells to cd <dig> signals are more significant in the primary activation signals. this is consistent with data reporting that cd8+ cells are less dependent on co-receptors for activation  <cit> .

lineage-commitment is characterized by the cytokine profiles that cells populations secrete and also by the presence of lineage-specific transcription factors that mediate epigenetic changes, favouring the expression of those cytokines  <cit> . in addition to the il-12- and the ifnγ-induced transcription factors stat- <dig> and stat- <dig>  t <dig> cells express t-bet, which is considered to be the t <dig> signature transcription factor  <cit> . in contrast, il-4-induced stat- <dig> as well as gata- <dig> are characteristic of t <dig> cells.  <cit> . here we report that the joint signals of cd <dig> and the tcr inhibited gata- <dig> transcription, both in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, and that those signals increased the transcription of t-bet in the cd4+ population only. to be able to respond to t <dig> stimulatory cytokines, t cells up-regulate the expression of the high affinity chains of the il-12r and ifnγr. with specific antibodies for the α chain of ifnγr or the β <dig> chains of il-12r, we evidenced that cd <dig> signals induce the membrane expression of both receptors, thereby contributing to the sensitivity of the cells towards t1-differentiating cytokines.

the distribution of the tcr relative to that of ifnγr has also been shown to be determinant for t cell commitment, suggesting a crosstalk between the tcr and ifnγ signalosomes  <cit> . we observed that in cd4+ t cells, cd <dig> signals either alone or in combination with tcr and/or il-12r ligation led to the co-clustering of ifnγr with the tcr, further adding to the t1-differentiating effects of cd <dig>  in contrast, in cd8+ cells, cd <dig> signals did not affect the membrane distribution of ifnγr and the tcr in the membrane. moreover, we did not find that these receptors co-localized in cd8+ t cells, where it has been reported that the redistribution of molecules during the immunological synapses is strongly dependent on cd <dig> engagement  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
all together our results suggest that cd <dig> signals favour cd4+ t cell differentiation to a t <dig> pattern. in conjunction with tcr-dependent signals, cd <dig> induced t bet and ifnγ genes and inhibited those of gata- <dig> and il- <dig>  concomitantly, cd43-treated cells became more sensitive to the t1-inducing cytokines ifnγ and il- <dig> through the up-regulation of their receptors. part of this could be achieved by the cd43-mediated co-clustering of the tcr and ifnγr.

in cd8+ t <dig> or t <dig> effector cells, cd <dig> signals moderately induced ifnγ expression. in freshly isolated cd <dig> cells, however, cd <dig> signals induced il- <dig> transcription, and failed to induce ifnγ expression. in cd4+ cells, the tcr and ifnγr co-localize and cluster together in response to cd <dig>  the tcr or il- <dig>  whereas in the cd8+ t cells, these receptors did not co-localize and did not re-distribute in response to the same stimuli. resolution of whether the differential responses of the cd4+ and cd8+ populations to cd43-specific signals could have a therapeutic use to dissociate t cell-mediated cytotoxicity of the inflammatory response requires further experiments.
