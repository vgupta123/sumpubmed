BACKGROUND
candida species are the causative agents of 8-10% of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections worldwide  <cit> . candida albicans remains the most common, but other species  are increasing in frequency. c. parapsilosis is currently the second most commonly isolated species in latin america, and it is particularly prevalent in children less than  <dig> year old  <cit> . c. parapsilosis is also a frequent cause of infection in europe  <cit> . pathogenesis of c. parapsilosis is associated with use of indwelling medical devices and with high glucose feeds  <cit> . this species is often found on the hands of health care workers, and has been responsible for several outbreak infections  <cit> .

until recently, c. parapsilosis isolates were believed to be highly heterogeneous, and were divided into groups i, ii and iii  <cit> . group i isolates are now defined as c. parapsilosis, whereas groups ii and iii have been redesignated as the closely related species c. orthopsilosis and c. metapsilosis  <cit> . c. parapsilosis group i isolates are very homogeneous, and are very difficult to distinguish using standard molecular methods such as rapd profiling  <cit> . sequencing the c. parapsilosis genome revealed that there are very few differences between the diploid chromosomes, with only one single nucleotide polymorphism  per  <dig>  bases  <cit> . this may indicate that the species has undergone a recent population bottleneck, perhaps related to the lack of a sexual cycle, and the loss of one mating type  <cit> .

the c. parapsilosis genome was sequenced in  <dig>  together with the genomes of  <dig> other candida species  <cit> . there are currently two independent annotations of the genome. one was generated from an early assembly  using an automated annotation pipeline and contains  <dig> gene models, which are identified with the prefix "cpag" . a second annotation produced by our laboratory using the same assembly characterized  <dig>  gene models , which are identified with the prefix "cpar"  <cit> . the initial annotations proved useful for large-scale comparative analysis  <cit>  and for the design and application of transcriptional profiling  <cit> . however, neither the "cpag" nor "cpar" annotations included predictions of introns in any genes. moreover, the genome sequence was also subsequently improved so that most of the current assembly consists of  <dig> contigs, corresponding to complete chromosomes  <cit> . we have now used this assembly as the basis for a new annotation of the c. parapsilosis genome.

we applied next-generation sequencing to explore and better define the transcriptional landscape. more than  <dig> million illumina reads were generated from seven different growth conditions . strand-specific and long read libraries were included in the experimental design. we used these data to refine gene models, determine intron boundaries, identify ntars and eliminate overlapping gene models lacking transcriptional support. we also used both rna-seq and microarray analysis to determine the transcriptional response of c. parapsilosis to growth on rich media in hypoxic conditions, and we found a high correlation between the two approaches. finally, we used transcriptional profiling to investigate the role of the upc <dig> transcription factor as a regulator of the hypoxic response.

RESULTS
determining the transcriptional profile of candida parapsilosis
next-generation sequencing  was used to determine the transcriptome of c. parapsilosis, and to annotate the genome. in order to maximize coverage, we generated libraries from several conditions, including varied temperature , media  and oxygen levels  . bmw media is designed to minimize growth differences between different species  <cit> . strand-specific libraries were prepared from some samples grown in normoxia and hypoxia, and for a wildtype strain and a strain carrying a knockout of an ortholog of the candida albicans upc <dig> transcription factor, a major regulator of ergosterol synthesis and the hypoxic response  <cit> . most reads were approximately  <dig> bases long; two long read  libraries were also generated commercially, from cells grown in ypd at 30Â°c. approximately  <dig> million reads  were mapped to single locations in the genome using tophat  <cit> .

we produced a new annotation  by combining the rna-seq data with the existing  annotations of the c. parapsilosis genome  <cit>  and visualizing using the artemis browser  <cit>  . we identified  <dig> novel gene models  that were not included in the cpag annotation described in butler et al  <cit>  . we removed  <dig> overlapping gene models, and we corrected  <dig> by altering the position of start and stop codons, removing in-frame stop codons or identifying internal introns . we also identified  <dig> pseudogenes that are well conserved with other candida species, but the reading frames are interrupted by stop codons. in total, the cpar <dig> annotation includes  <dig> protein-coding genes and  <dig> potential trna genes that were predicted using trnascan-se  <cit>  . we detected expression  of 94% of the total protein-coding genes in the cpar <dig> annotation.

3new and modified orfs include the identification of  <dig> introns in  <dig> genes, listed in additional file  <dig> 

to identify the boundaries of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions  we looked for continuous read coverage  that extended beyond the open reading frames. it was not always possible to correctly establish the utr boundary, particularly where intergenic regions are small. where possible, strand specific data was used to differentiate the utrs of genes that are on opposite strands. we identified 5' utrs for  <dig> gene models, plus an additional  <dig> gene models where the predicted utr overlaps with a neighboring annotated feature . for  <dig> 5' utrs and  <dig> 3' utrs, the expression level was not high enough to analyze. genes with long 5' utrs  are enriched for regulatory go processes  suggesting that there is a correlation between long utr regions and regulatory function. this has also been reported in c. albicans  <cit> . we identified  <dig> 3' utrs, of which  <dig> are longer than  <dig> bp. these are not enriched for any go term. we were unable to define the 3' utr for  <dig> gene models because they overlapped with the utr or coding region of the neighboring gene.

intron discovery
one of the main advantages of rna-seq is that it can be used to characterize introns. tophat  <cit>  identifies reads that overlap a splice junction, and aligns them to either side of a canonical splice site. we manually curated each candidate predicted by tophat by examining the overall read coverage, verifying the presence of canonical  splice sites, and comparing to orthologous genes from closely related species. we found rna-seq evidence supporting  <dig> novel introns, many in open reading frames not described in the cpag and cpar annotations. most of the introns  were identified from  <dig>  million reads of  <dig> base pairs ; the longer reads were considerably more useful than the shorter ones. to identify introns in genes that are not expressed in the conditions we used, we compared the c. parapsilosis genome to gene models predicted in c. albicans  <cit> . we identified an additional  <dig> introns that are conserved between c. albicans and c. parapsilosis.

our final annotation includes a total of  <dig> introns in  <dig> genes . whereas most lie within coding sequences,  <dig> introns are located in 5' utrs, and there are two in 3' utrs. we selected a sample of eight gene models for validation by rt-pcr: one with two 3'utr introns, two with introns in the 5' utr, and five with introns within the coding region . the selected genes included orthologs of four that are known to contain introns in c. albicans, which are conserved in c. parapsilosis . the c. parapsilosis orthologs of rpl <dig>  and rps29a  contain introns in the 5'utr regions that are spliced during growth on ypd . these are not annotated in c. albicans. in addition, orf <dig>  has no annotated intron in c. albicans, but its c. parapsilosis ortholog  contains an intron in the coding sequence. it is possible that many of these differences are due to errors in annotation in c. albicans.

the two 3' utr introns we identified by rna-seq are both in the same gene, cpar2_ <dig>  we confirmed both by rt-pcr . cpar2_ <dig> is an ortholog of c. albicans orf <dig>  , which has no known introns. although 3' utr introns have been reported in animals and plants  <cit>  and in fungi such as cryptococcus  <cit> , no 3' utr introns have been identified previously in candida or saccharomyces species. introns in 3' utrs are assumed to be rare because structures after stop codons are likely to subject the mrna to nonsense-mediated decay  <cit> . the 3' exons in cpar2_ <dig> are transcribed at a much lower level than the reading frame , and unspliced as well as spliced products are present . it is therefore possible that the 3' utr introns are important for the regulation of expression of this gene.

the total numbers of introns are similar in c. albicans  and c. parapsilosis . the 5' and 3' splice site consensus are also very similar . however, the median length is smaller in c. parapsilosis  than in c. albicans  . for many other candida species, the genome annotations are not accurate enough to compare intron locations. any comparative analysis is therefore restricted to genomes were introns have been predicted, or experimentally identified. for example, in c. albicans introns have been carefully validated using both experimental and predictive methods  <cit> . the genome annotations of c. dubliniensis and debaryomyces hansenii also include predictions of a significant numbers of introns  <cit> . we therefore compared the intronic landscape of these three species with c. parapsilosis. orthologous genes were identified using the candida gene order browser  <cit> .

we found that among  <dig> orthologous genes present in all four species,  <dig> have introns in at least one species  . we attempted to identify introns that were gained or lost in individual species using the approach described in zhang et al  <cit>  . an intron was scored as a "gain" if it was present in only one candida species  . an intron is assumed to be "lost" if it is present in most of the species, and missing in either a single species or a single lineage. we could not determine the evolutionary origin of most introns , which are conserved in all the species tested. other cases were ambiguous, for example introns present in only the orthologs from c. dubliniensis and d. hansenii, could represent independent gains in these species, or independent losses in the others. where possible we included outgroups such as saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia pastoris  <cit>  to evaluate potential intron gains. overall, we identified at least  <dig> cases of intron gain, and  <dig> cases of intron loss. we identified  <dig> introns present and  <dig> introns absent in d. hansenii genes only, which may result from intron gain/loss. however, we have not included this in figure  <dig> because we are lacking well-annotated sequence information from close relatives of d. hansenii and so we cannot determine when the gain/losses occurred.

we identified eight instances where introns were apparently gained in c. parapsilosis, and  <dig> examples of intron loss . figure  <dig> shows one example of intron gain. at least  <dig> of these introns are also present in orthologs from c. orthopsilosis , and were therefore most likely gained in the common ancestor. we could not determine the presence of the remaining two in c. orthopsilosis because of a lack of sequence information. in most eukaryotes, intron loss is much more common than intron gain  <cit> . however, intron gain is relatively common in the ascomycetes  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms are still not known, and are hypothesized to include insertion of transposable elements, insertion of spliced introns from other genes into mrna followed by reverse transcription, and genomic duplication  <cit> . intron loss is most likely to occur by reverse transcription of spliced messenger mrnas  <cit> . the origin of the gained introns in c. parapsilosis is not clear; there are no orthologous sequences elsewhere in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome.

identification of novel transcribed regions
analysis of the transcriptional profile of c. albicans using rna-seq and microarrays has identified several hundred, and possibly several thousand novel transcribed regions  that are unlikely to encode proteins  <cit> . we manually examined the c. parapsilosis data for evidence of ntars. because there is a wide variety in the number of novel transcribed regions identified by different methods  <cit> , we used a very conservative manual approach, and counted only those c. parapsilosis regions where transcription is visually higher than background. we identified  <dig> regions that do not overlap with annotated orfs , and do not appear to encode proteins. we suspect that many of these regions may represent non-coding rnas or other regulatory rnas. in fact, some are small nuclear rnas, such as the example shown in figure 1c.

analysis of the transcriptional response of c. parapsilosis to hypoxia
exposure of c. albicans to hypoxic conditions, such as those encountered in the host during infection, results in a switch from yeast-like to hyphal growth, increased expression of genes involved in ergosterol synthesis and glycolysis, and decreased expression of genes encoding steps in the tca cycle and in oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . c. parapsilosis does not undergo true hyphal growth. however, we previously used microarray profiling to show that similar metabolic changes  occur in cells exposed to low oxygen in minimal media  <cit> . the transcriptional profile of cells growing in hypoxia resembles that of biofilm cells for both c. albicans and c. parapsilosis, and it has been shown that the metabolic adaptation to hypoxia is important for biofilm development by c. albicans  <cit> .

we describe here the use of rna-seq and microarray profiling to determine the transcriptional profile of c. parapsilosis cells grown in rich medium in hypoxic conditions. for the rna-seq experiments, we observed a high correlation among six biological replicates grown in ypd in normoxia  and four biological replicates grown in hypoxia  . differentially expressed genes were identified by using cufflinks, open source software specifically design to measure transcriptional differences  <cit> . expression values were defined using fpkm and quantile normalization was applied.

a large number of genes are differentially expressed. most are up-regulated in hypoxic conditions  . we identified more genes with altered expression using rna-seq than by using microarrays  <cit>  . however, although the microarray and rna-seq profiling experiments were carried out at different times and by different personnel, the correlation between the two approaches is high  . for example, we observed a high degree of overlap between the go categories that are significantly enriched using the two approaches . these include increased expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and ergosterol biosynthesis, and decreased expression of genes involved in cellular respiration and the tricarboxylic acid cycle . for up-regulated genes all of the go processes identified by microarray profiling are also present in the rna-seq data set; some additional categories were identified in the rna-seq profile only, including fatty acid oxidation and glucose transport . for the down-regulated genes, some categories such as amino-acid biosynthesis genes are over-represented in the microarray profiling experiments, and purine metabolism is over-represented in the rna-seq data only. some of the differences observed may reflect differences in experimental conditions; however, overall the two approaches produced very similar results.

the cpar2_ <dig> gene has the most dramatic increase in expression in the rna-seq  and in the microarray profiling experiments  . cpar2_ <dig> has no known ortholog in other candida species, no conserved domains, and no significant similarity to any other known proteins. expression of cpar2_ <dig> is similar to that of the ergosterol pathway genes , and will be the subject of future investigation. we have previously shown that rbt <dig> expression is increased during growth in minimal media in hypoxic conditions, and that the gene is required for optimal biofilm formation by c. parapsilosis  <cit> ; our current analyses confirms that hypoxic induction of rbt <dig> also occurs during growth in rich media .

in s. cerevisiae, expression of oxygen-responsive genes in controlled by monitoring the levels of heme and ergosterol  <cit> . ergosterol synthesis genes are regulated by the paralog pair ecm <dig> and upc <dig>  which respond to sterol levels  <cit> . c. albicans has only one ortholog of ecm <dig> and upc <dig> , and this is required for the up-regulation of ergosterol and drug resistance genes in hypoxia  <cit> . we therefore determined the effect of knocking out the ortholog of upc <dig> in c. parapsilosis. one allele was knocked out by replacing his <dig>  and one by replacing with ura <dig> . knocking out upc <dig> increases the sensitivity of c. parapsilosis cells to azole drugs , similar to the phenotype reported for c. albicans  <cit> . we used both microarrays and rna-seq to determine the transcriptional profile of wildtype and upc <dig> deletion cells grown in hypoxic conditions. we identified  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in the upc <dig> deletion grown using rna-seq, and  <dig> genes using microarray profiling . the same cell cultures were used for both experiments, and there is a high correlation between the gene expression levels identified by the two methods .  <dig> genes with differential expression were identified by both methods . go analysis indicates that genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis and response to drug have decreased expression in the upc <dig> deletion .

to assess the importance of upc <dig> as an hypoxic regulator, we used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify genes with shared expression patterns in the hypoxia/normoxia dataset and in the upc <dig> deletion . we used the profiles generated from microarrays rather than rna-seq for this comparison, partly because the methods are better developed, and because it allowed us to compare our results with our previously published analysis of the hypoxic response of c. albicans  <cit> . we identified six major clusters . expression of genes in clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  is greatly increased in wildtype cells grown in hypoxia, and is repressed in the upc <dig> deletion grown in the same conditions . these clusters contain most of the genes required for ergosterol metabolism. cluster  <dig> includes  <dig> genes encoding oxygen-dependent enzymes  whereas cluster  <dig> includes both oxygen-dependent  and oxygen-independent steps  . genes in cluster  <dig> are also induced in the wildtype in hypoxia, but not in the upc <dig> deletion. go analysis indicated that this cluster is enriched in processes associated with glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism . genes in cluster  <dig> are induced in hypoxia in wildtype and in the upc <dig> deletion , and genes in cluster  <dig> have reduced expression in both strains . genes in cluster  <dig> are more upregulated in hypoxia in the upc <dig> deletion, and are not enriched for any specific go processes

our results suggest that upc <dig> in c. parapsilosis is required for induction of expression of ergosterol synthesis genes in hypoxia . in the absence of upc <dig>  expression of these genes is repressed. deleting upc <dig> decreases the hypoxic induction of glycolytic genes , but not to as great an extent as the reduction in expression of the ergosterol pathway. it is therefore likely that similar to c. albicans, expression of the ergosterol pathway in c. parapsilosis is directly regulated by upc <dig>  but expression of glycolytic genes although influenced by upc <dig> is likely to be controlled by other transcription factors . upc <dig> does not play any role in the reduction of expression of respiratory genes in hypoxia  nor in the induction of genes associated with oxidation-reduction . the potential role of upc <dig> to regulate genes in cluster  <dig> requires further investigation.

we did not observe a statistically significant enrichment of iron metabolism genes during hypoxic growth of c. parapsilosis, in either the microarray or the rna-seq data. this differs from c. albicans  <cit> . however, expression of at least three ferric reductases , an iron permease , a multicopper oxidase and several iron-containing proteins is decreased, and expression of hem <dig>  heme oxygenase  and a catalase  is increased in the rna-seq data, and for some also in the microarray data . it is therefore likely that iron metabolism genes are similarly regulated in the two species. overall, our analyses indicate that c. albicans and c. parapsilosis have a similar response to hypoxia, and that the role of upc <dig> is conserved.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe the first comprehensive annotation of the c. parapsilosis genome, which is supported by expression analysis. we identified >  <dig> new open reading frames and corrected the annotation of hundreds more. we also identified several ntars, many of which are likely to represent non-coding rnas . we identified two introns in the 3' utr of a single gene, suggesting that regulated splicing may be involved in gene regulation. c. parapsilosis genes have few introns, similar to other species in the saccharomycotina. however, we identified a small number of introns that were both gained and lost in recent evolutionary history. we also used rna-seq and microarray profiling to identify the targets of the upc <dig> transcription factor, and show that it has a major role as a regulator of ergosterol synthesis in c. parapsilosis.
