BACKGROUND
in the past few decades, a large number of bacterial strains have evolved ways to adapt or become resistant to the currently available antibiotics  <cit> . researchers are focusing on alternative drugs based on antimicrobial peptides, which play an important role in innate immunity. as part of innate immune system, antimicrobial peptides provide protection against a wide variety of microorganisms in both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . these peptides are very diverse with respect to amino acid sequence and secondary structure but share certain properties, such as affinity for the negatively charged phospholipids that are present on the outer surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane of many microbial species. these peptides are ubiquitous, simple and effective factors acting within the innate immune system. their short length and fast & efficient action against microbes has made them potential candidates as peptide drugs  <cit> . several peptides and their derivatives have already passed clinical trials successfully  <cit>  and several others are considered as potential therapeutics  <cit> .

antimicrobial peptides have a broad spectrum of activity, including activity against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and even cancer cells  <cit> . other than having pathogen-lytic activities, these peptides have other properties like anti-tumour activity; mitogen activity, or act as signalling molecules  <cit> . in addition, they have a number of biotechnological applications, e.g. in transgenic plants  <cit> , in aquaculture, and as aerosol spray for patients of cystic fibrosis  <cit> . in the past extensive work has been done in the field of antibacterial peptides, describing their identification, characterization, mechanism of action etc. the information about these peptides has been collected and compiled; following are major databases on antimicrobial peptides i) antimic have around  <dig> sequences  <cit>  ii) amsdb consists  <dig> antimicrobial peptides of eukaryotic origin  <cit> , iii) peptaibol consists of around  <dig> antibiotic peptides originated from fungal organisms  <cit>  and iv) apd consists of detailed information for  <dig> antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

recently, a hmm  based method has been developed for searching conserved motifs of β-defensin family in genome databases  <cit> . the antibacterial peptides have little sequence homology, despite common properties  <cit> . thus it is difficult to develop method for predicting the antibacterial peptides based on similarity. moreover, experimental methods for identification and designing of antibacterial peptides are costly, time consuming and resource intensive. thus there is a need to develop computational tools for predicting antibacterial peptides, which could be used to design potent peptides against bacterial pathogens.

in the present study, a systematic attempt has been made to understand this important class of peptides and to develop an algorithm for predicting antibacterial peptides with high accuracy. first, we collected and analyzed antibacterial peptides in order to understand preference of residue type at different positions. we also compared composition of antibacterial and non-antibacterial peptides. we analyzed residues of both n and c termini as both play important role in their activity; for example, c-terminus is responsible for the membrane interaction and pore formation, while the n-terminal region is important in bacteria-specific interaction process  <cit> . based on our observation, we developed our methods using both n-terminus and c-terminus approach. in this study, three popular classification techniques, namely, quantitative matrix , artificial neural network  and support vector machine , have been used to predict antibacterial peptides.

RESULTS
analysis of the antibacterial peptides
the frequency of occurrence of all  <dig> natural amino acids at both termini was examined. it was observed that particular types of residues are preferred over others in anti-bacterial peptides. in order to demonstrate residue preference at different position of antibacterial peptides, sequence logos using plogo program  <cit>  were generated. the sequence logos of  <dig> n-terminal and c-terminal residues are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>  certain residues are more abundant at specific positions, e.g., g, f, v, r at first position; l, i, w, f at 2nd position etc. overall antibacterial peptides are dominated by certain type of residues like g, r, k, l etc., being present at most of the positions. similarly, certain residues are preferred at the c-terminus, for example residues k, g, c, and r are preferred at most of the positions.

in order to understand biasness of residues in antibacterial peptides, we computed frequency of each type of the residues in antibacterial and non-antibacterial peptides. as shown in figure additional file:  <dig> , residues g and f are significantly higher at first position of n-terminus of antibacterial peptides than that of non-antibacterial peptides. similarly residues w, i, l, f are more frequent at the 2nd position of n-terminus of antibacterial peptides in comparison to non-antibacterial peptides. we also computed polar, non-polar, positive charge residues etc. at different positions of antibacterial peptides and compared with non-bacterial peptides . though both termini possess higher frequency of positively charged residues , the difference between the frequency of these residues between the antibacterial and non-antibacterial peptides is higher at the c-terminus. the difference in the frequencies of the positively charged residues between the positive and negative examples increases from position  <dig> to  <dig> at the n-terminus, whereas it tends to decrease from position  <dig> to  <dig> at the c-terminus. while higher frequency of the positively charged residues may be helping the c-terminus to interact with the negatively charged bacterial membrane, positively charged residues at the n-terminus may help in the interaction between these peptides and intracellular components like dna and rna, thus hampering the crucial bacterial functions. the proportion of cysteine is higher at the n-terminus also. the proportion of negatively charged amino acids  were also found to be very low, as expected, since these may interfere during the course of penetration of the negatively charged cell membrane of the bacteria.

overall compositional biasness
as shown in the above analysis , antibacterial peptides have preference for certain types of residues at certain positions. the next question is if the overall composition of these antibacterial is also different from that of non-antibacterial peptides. thus we compared the overall amino acid composition of antibacterial and non-antibacterial peptides. as shown in figure  <dig>  certain residues like c, g, i and k are significantly higher in antibacterial peptides, as expected, since these residues are preferred at certain positions in antibacterial peptides. it is also noteworthy that residue r was not significantly higher in antibacterial peptides, though it was preferred at certain positions. certain residues like d, e, s and p are not preferred in antibacterial peptides.

prediction of antibacterial peptides
whole peptide
the prediction of antibacterial peptides is difficult, but very important. in the past attempts have been made, but these methods are subjective, based on physico-chemical property plots, than quantitative. the prediction of antibacterial peptides is difficult due to variation in the size of antibacterial peptides, since the machine learning techniques need fixed length pattern. thus the question was how to circumvent this problem and develop a machine learning based method for predicting antibacterial peptides. as shown in figure  <dig>  amino acid composition of antibacterial peptides is significantly different from that of non-antibacterial peptides. in the past, methods have been developed based on machine learning techniques, using protein composition to classify the proteins , particularly for subcellular localization of proteins. thus, we have developed a svm based model using amino acid composition on our main dataset and achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % with sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % . though we could predict antibacterial peptides with high accuracy using amino acid composition, we realised the weakness of this composition-based approach, since it is difficult to decide what length we should search in proteins as length of antibacterial peptides varied from  <dig> to ~ <dig>  despite its better performance, it is impossible to use this approach for searching antibacterial peptides in genomes or proteins.

n-terminal approach
it has been observed that certain types of residues are preferred at the n-terminal regions of antibacterial peptides. thus we made an attempt to develop a method for predicting antibacterial peptides using their n-terminal residues. we created a dataset nt <dig> which consists of  <dig> n-terminal residues of antibacterial and non-antibacterial peptides . then we developed a svm model using the amino acid composition of these n-terminal residues and achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % specificity . the performance of this svm module is much lower than of svm module using composition of whole peptide, but this module can be used to scan antibacterial peptides in protein sequences. as we are using only first five residues here, it's possible to use these residues as binary pattern instead of composition. in binary pattern a vector of dimension  <dig> represents a residue, and for  <dig> residues the input vector of dimension is  <dig> . as shown in table  <dig>  we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % using the binary pattern based svm model. overall, the binary-based svm model performs better than composition based model using first five n-terminal residues. thus we extended our binary-based svm models for predicting antibacterial peptides using more number of residues from the n-terminus. as shown in table  <dig>  we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % with specificity of  <dig> % using binary-based svm using the first  <dig> n-terminal residues. we got the best accuracy using first  <dig> n-terminal residues, which is  <dig> % with specificity  <dig> %.

c-terminal and n+c terminal
we have used the same strategy for the c-terminus as used for the n-terminus. the performance of binary-based svm model using  <dig> c-terminal residues is shown in table  <dig>  though performance was lower using c-terminal residues, the trend of performance was same. in order to check if using the n and c-termini of the peptides together will enhance the accuracy of the method, we developed a n+c-terminus based approach. in this approach the first and last  <dig> residues of each peptide in the original dataset were joined in order to create the positive dataset of nc-termini based method. similar strategy as used in the n and c termini approaches were applied in this approach also. the performance of binary-based svm model using n+c terminal residues is shown in table  <dig>  we got an accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig> % specificity using binary-based svm model using the first and last  <dig> residues. this model performs better than other models. the trend of performance in this case too follows the trend shown by the above two approaches, but the performance of this approach.

quantitative matrices 
in case of qm, the contribution of each residue for each position of antibacterial peptide has been calculated. a matrix with weights for each amino acid residue in every position of peptide was generated using equation  <dig>  table s <dig> in supplementary file shows the propensity of each residue at each position in antibacterial peptides. higher positive score of a residue at a given position means this residue is highly preferred at that position, for example g, w, d and c are highly preferred at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  similarly, higher negative scores mean that residue is not preferred in antibacterial peptides at that position. one of the major advantages of qm is that the effect of each residue on antibacterial activity of peptide could be easily estimated. as shown in table  <dig>  we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, using  <dig> residues of n, c and n+c terminal of peptides, respectively.

artificial neural network 
the neural network is a powerful machine learning technique commonly used in the field of bioinformatics. thus we also used this technique in this study for predicting antibacterial peptides. the performance of ann-based method using  <dig> n-terminal residues is shown in table  <dig>  we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, using  <dig> residues of n, c and n+c terminal of peptides, respectively. though the trend was same as that of svm, qm and ann models, the performance of ann was poor compared to other techniques. this is probably due to the small number of peptides used for training the models.

consensus approach
in an attempt to enhance the prediction accuracy we tried the consensus approach. in this approach svm, qm and ann, were separately used to predict whether a peptide is antibacterial or not. a peptide was considered to be predicted positive only if at least two of these techniques predict it as a positive. otherwise the peptide was predicted negative. the accuracy of this consensus prediction was calculated. this was done for all the three approaches i.e. n-terminal; c-terminal and nc-terminal approach . it was observed that the performance of consensus model was slightly better than that of svm model.

performance on independent or blind dataset
the models developed in this study were evaluated on an independent dataset . these antibacterial peptides in the independent dataset were not used for developing above models either in training or testing. this dataset consists of  <dig> antimicrobial peptides obtained from swiss-prot. as shown in table  <dig>  svm, ann and qm correctly predicted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> antibacterial peptides, respectively, using n-terminal residues of peptides. in case of c-terminus based approach svm, ann and qm correctly predicted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> peptides, respectively. it was interesting to note that the c-terminus based models perform better than the n-terminus based models, which is in contrast to the results when evaluated using five-fold cross validation. the models based on n+c termini correctly predicted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> peptides, using svm, ann and qm, respectively. overall performance of our models was very poor on independent dataset in comparison to performance on the main dataset. in order to understand the reason of poor performance we randomly extracted  <dig> peptides from the main dataset to form a new independent dataset and added  <dig> peptides from the old independent dataset to the main dataset. then we retrained our models and evaluated their performance on  <dig> peptides of new independent dataset. as shown in table  <dig> performance of models on these  <dig> peptides was as good as performance on main dataset. this shows that our  <dig> original peptides used as independent dataset have either some uniqueness or some problem. thus we reanalyzed these peptides and observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> are pure peptides  and  <dig> peptides are precursors to antibacterial peptides  that require further processing in order to produce active antibacterial peptides. the poor performance on independent dataset may be due to inclusion of these precursor sequences in the independent dataset as the dataset used for training the method contains only active antibacterial peptides . thus we checked the performance of our method on these  <dig> active antibacterial sequences, and as expected the performance of our method on these  <dig> sequences was as good as on main dataset.

discussion
in the past attempts have been made to develop methods and strategies for designing effective antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . in this paper we have made systematic and comprehensive effort to understand and predict antibacterial peptides. as shown figure  <dig> and  <dig>  antibacterial peptides have preference for certain types of residues at certain positions. this observation is very important for experimentalists in designing de-novo antibacterial peptides; they may substitute amino acids at certain positions in order to make the peptides more effective. the quantitative matrices provide the magnitude of contribution of each type of residue at each position of antibacterial peptide. this information can be used directly for designing antibacterial peptides . the major challenge was to develop an accurate method for predicting antibacterial peptides due to two major reasons; i) the antibacterial peptides have lot of variation in size and machine learning software need fixed length pattern and ii) experimentally proven non-antibacterial are not available which are very important for developing the method. this problem is similar to b-cell epitope prediction  <cit> . in order to handle the problem we developed methods using only limited number of residues from the n and c termini of peptides. in order to generate non-antibacterial peptides or negative examples, we obtained peptides randomly from non-secretory proteins  <cit> . though some these peptides can be antibacterial, but chances are very rare.

first we attempted to develop models to discriminate antibacterial peptides from non-antibacterial peptides using whole peptides. in this case we used amino acid composition of peptides as input for our models. though this model discriminates antibacterial peptides with high accuracy, it is difficult to use this model for scanning potential antibacterial proteins. thus wee used n-terminal, c-terminal and n+c terminal approaches, as both n and c-termini play an important role in antibacterial activity, as suggested by the literature cited. the c-terminus interacts with the cell membrane and makes a pore, whereas the n-terminus helps in bacteria specific interaction process. one of the limitations of machine learning techniques is that they require fixed length input vectors. antibacterial peptides, on the contrary, are of varying length. therefore, peptides of fixed lengths  were used to develop a svm model. the number of peptides reduced significantly when  <dig> or  <dig> residue long peptides are used instead of  <dig> residues . thus in this study, we made models using  <dig> residues only as most  of the antibacterial peptides are 20– <dig> residues long. the performance of all the approaches was evaluated using five fold cross validation techniques. performance of all modules based on qm, ann and svm was impressive but svm based module using fifteen residues was the best. the poor performance of the ann as compared to qm and svm is due to the over optimization of ann. it has been shown in the past that ann suffers with the problem of over optimization when the training dataset is small  <cit> .

antibp, though has some limitations like not including post-translational modifications and topological aspects, but to the best of our knowledge it is first method developed for predicting and designing potential antibacterial peptides. our methods are likely to help the researchers in finding and in designing better peptides-based antibiotics.

CONCLUSIONS
currently a great deal of interest is shown in antibacterial peptides, so called "nature's antibiotics", which seem to be promising to overcome the growing problem of antibiotic resistance  <cit> . the design of novel peptides with antimicrobial activities requires the development of methods for narrowing down the candidate peptides so as to enable rational experimentation by wet-lab scientists. antibp is one such method meant to discover efficacious antibacterial peptides that we hope could prove to be a boon to combat the dreadful antibiotic resistant bacteria.
