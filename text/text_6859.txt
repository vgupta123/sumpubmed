BACKGROUND
the bactrocera dorsalis  is a major horticultural pest. more than  <dig> species have been identified within this group  <cit> . some of the b. dorsalis species are highly destructive because of their wide host-ranges, considerable ecological adaptability, pronounced reproductive potential, and dispersal capacity. the b. dorsalis s.s., b. papayae, and b. philippinensis species have become invasive in many parts of china. despite previous studies that have described the subtle morphological characteristics distinguishing these three species  <cit> , taxonomists still doubt whether b. dorsalis s.s., b. papayae, and b. philippinensis are truly separate species  <cit> .

b. dorsalis s.s. was first recorded in taiwan in  <dig> and is now widely distributed in most countries in the asia-pacific region  <cit> . specifically, it has dispersed from china to the northern parts of the indian subcontinent over the past 90 years  <cit> . b. dorsalis s.s. has been observed multiple times in china during the past hundred years  <cit> . currently, b. dorsalis s.s. is distributed mostly in china’s southern provinces  <cit> .

mitochondrial dna analyses have been conducted to study the genetic structure and origin of b. dorsalis s.s. populations in china and southeast asia  <cit> . however, the results of these studies have been inconsistent, although it is not known whether these inconsistencies should be attributed to differences in sampling strategies and approaches to analysis. according to schutze et al., b. dorsalis s.s., b. papayae, and b. philippinensis should be considered a single species  <cit> . if this is correct, then analysis of populations sampled from both the ranges of b. philippinensis and the b. dorsalis s.s. /b. papayae transition zone  should provide clues regarding the invasion events in the region  <cit> . although mitochondrial dna markers have been used to examine the changes in the structures of chinese populations of b. dorsalis s.s. over time, the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  markers in b. dorsalis s.s. have not yet been used for an evaluation of the distribution area of b. philippinensis or the b. dorsalis s.s./b. papayae transition zone  <cit> . in the present investigation, nd <dig> was used as a genetic marker to study the genetic structure and origin of the b. dorsalis s.s. population within china and the surrounding areas. mitochondrial dna is suitable for analyses of population genetics because of its relatively high rate of genetic evolution  <cit> . the study included samples from the b. philippinensis distribution area and b. dorsalis s.s. /b. papayae transition zone to  determine the actual number of cryptic species and cryptic lineages of b. dorsalis s.s. within china;  assess the molecular diversity and genetic architecture of the populations;  resolve the controversy of the origin and range expansion of b. dorsalis s.s. within china.

RESULTS
two distinct lineages in chinese b. dorsalis s.s
a total of  <dig> b. dorsalis s.s. populations from china and surrounding areas  were investigated. analysis of <dig> nd <dig> sequences from these  <dig> samples revealed a total of  <dig> haplotypes, of which  <dig> were shared and the remaining  <dig> were single haplotypes. by performing median-joining network analysis, two distinct networks were identified among these  <dig> haplotypes . the results of the phylogenetic analysis  and network analysis clearly showed two distinct lineages, or cryptic species of b. dorsalis s.s., in these samples.

the lineage i network exhibited seven haplotypes  and the lineage ii network showed a star-like pattern with six predominant haplotypes  . the remaining haplotypes identified from the samples constituted single population groups. the lineage ii network mainly included the pattaya and panzhihua populations . the smaller haplotypes of lineage ii network, although connected to the central haplotypes, were found frequently . these results suggest that most haplotypes have a wide geographic distribution throughout china and the surrounding areas. rare haplotypes were mainly distributed in pattaya and panzhihua, showing strict geographic distribution characteristics. these findings suggest that the pattaya and panzhihua are mix zones of two distinct lineages, which are here treated as putative species.

limited genetic differentiation in geographical populations
to understand the population structure of b. dorsalis s.s., a spatial analysis of molecular variance  of the nd <dig> sequences was performed. the fct values in the samova analysis of the lineage ii network suggested the existence of three population groups . the  <dig> populations clustered as follows: guangzhou, zhuhai, nanning, pingxiang, yuxi, hekou, yuzhong, guiyang, haikou, wenchang, taibei, bangkok, and phou phanang as subgroup 1; fuzhou, zhangzhou, and xiamen as subgroup 2; and manila alone as subgroup  <dig>  the group comprising most of mainland china, hainan island, taiwan island, and southeastern asia  was found to be the largest subgroup among all the samples .

the amova analysis showed inter-subgroup genetic differentiation to account for  <dig> % of all differentiation. the genetic differentiation within populations accounted for  <dig> %. the analysis also showed genetic differentiation among the three subgroups to be very limited  . differentiation among groups  and within populations  was not found to be significant. however, differentiation between groups within the same population  was  . mantel testing indicated significant association between the pairwise coefficient of genetic differentiation  and the pairwise geographical distance  within lineage ii . geographical population cluster levels of genetic differentiation ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  in the fst values. there was considerable differentiation between the b. philippinensis and all other populations  but moderate amount of differentiation between three other southeast asian populations  and all other populations . the amount of differentiation among b. dorsalis s.s. populations within china was also moderate  .

results obtained from genetic diversity analysis among the  <dig> geographic populations are summarized in table  <dig>  the number of haplotypes per population  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  haplotype diversity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and nucleotide diversity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these differences suggested that all populations retained fairly high levels of genetic diversity. the manila population showed the most nucleotide diversity , followed by the pattaya population.

high migration rates in specific southeast asian populations
the migration rate of lineage ii was estimated in both directions using migrate. results are shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the migration rate ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . specific southeast asian populations  showed very high migration rates. asymmetric migration was observed between manila and pattaya. a similar situation was observed in populations located from bangkok to china , from pattaya to china , from phou to china , and from manila to china . the direction of migration between two sites can be inferred using these asymmetric migration patterns .

marked historical population expansion
the sequence variation of nd <dig> genes was used to perform tajima’s d test to determine significance of deviations from neutrality. a negative d value is produced when more than an expected number of polymorphic sites have low frequencies within a sample. this pattern can be explained by either a recent increase in the size of the population or recent selection  <cit> . results indicate negative values  for lineage ii, but these were not found to be statistically significant . this is consistent with a neutral mutation hypothesis for the polymorphisms observed in the nd <dig> gene. tests of population expansion using fu’s fs were negative and statistically significant across the entire dataset . the mismatch distribution of lineage ii populations was distinctly unimodal , which is strongly indicative of historical population expansion. in lineage i, both tests of population expansion using fu’s fs  and mismatch distribution analysis  suggested that a bottleneck had occurred in lineage i.

discussion
molecular markers and sampling strategy
molecular markers are useful tools for genetic analysis. they can be used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying biological invasion. they are applicable to the identification of cryptic invasions, reconstruction of invasion history, and assessment of the genetic structure of a population  <cit> . mitochondrial genes such as the cytochrome oxidase genes  have served as molecular makers in studies of the population genetics of invasive insects  <cit> . although the use of the nadh dehydrogenase gene in such studies is relatively rare, the results of the present study suggest that the nadh dehydrogenase gene is very useful because it shows greater nucleotide substitution rates and more variation than the cytochrome oxidase gene  <cit> . because of this higher rate of variation, the nadh dehydrogenase gene provided a higher resolution in deciphering the geographical population genetics of the recent invasion. nadh dehydrogenase genes have been successfully applied to phylogenetic and population genetic studies of insects, both as an alternative and as a complement to cytochrome oxidase genes  <cit> . recent investigations of diversity within the b. dorsalis s.s. population have focused primarily on mitochondrial genes encoding subunits i or ii of cytochrome oxidase   <cit> . it is likely that the b. dorsalis s.s. found in china is a recent invasion  <cit> . nadh dehydrogenase genes could be better suited to the study of recent invasions. miller et al. suggested that the gene encoding nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  may be suitable for the study of geographical populations and genetic evolution in insects  <cit> . based on these facts, nd <dig> was chosen for the present study of b. dorsalis s.s. population genetics. earlier claims, in terms of sampling strategy, were not based on an extensive coverage of the distribution of known species. until recently, b. dorsalis s.s., b. papayae, and b. philippinensis were thought to belong to different species  <cit> . however, integrative taxonomy has shown that they are actually a single species  <cit> . for this reason, a larger number of samples were used than in previous studies, and these samples were taken from sites across a broader geographical range .

genetic structure, demographic history, and identification of cryptic invasions
evidence from the nd <dig> gene indicated the existence of two distinct lineages that are sympatric within some parts of pattaya and panzhihua . of the  <dig> individuals,  <dig> were found to belong to the lineage i clade and  <dig> to lineage ii. this disequilibrium can be explained by the existence of two putative species. the first dispersed across a wide geographic area, and the second underwent genetic hitchhiking using external factors . the role of wolbachia in population differentiation and gene flow is known  <cit> . previous studies have also found similar phenomena in other species, including dipteran drosophila melanogaster <cit> , drosophila simulans <cit> , rhagoletis cerasi <cit> , mosquitoes  <cit> , hemipteran bemisia tabaci <cit> , and lepidopteran danaus chrysippus   <cit> . these phenomena suggest that infection of maternally inherited microorganisms may influence random mating among specific taxa, leading to divergence  <cit> . if wolbachia had a role in population structure observed in the current study has yet to be examined. in lineage ii, a weak genetic structure was observed due to low differentiation among three groups . this is consistent with the results by wan et al.  <cit> .

median-joining networks showed that each clade contains both widespread and localized haplotypes . these patterns suggest recent increases in population size and geographical range. mismatch distribution analysis was conducted to evaluate the history of species expansion  <cit> . in order to confirm whether or not the b. dorsalis s.s population had experienced a large-scale population expansion, the arlequin  <dig>  software package was used to analyze mismatch distribution between the haplotypes’ base variance. the results showed significant differences between observed and expected values of the haplotypes’ base variance along with distinct unimodality distribution patterns of variation . the estimated effective population size after expansion  was  <dig>  times higher than before expansion  . it was here inferred that the b. dorsalis s.s populations of lineage ii has experienced rapid expansion in recent years. the average number of nucleotide differences is significantly affected by a population bottleneck, but the number of segregation sites is not  <cit> . as indicated by the average number of differences in nucleotide sequence  , chinese b. dorsalis s.s populations showed stronger indications of bottleneck and founder events than the southeast asian populations .

previous taxonomic analyses of the b. dorsalis complex were based on geographical subdivisions due to the difficulties of discrimination using morphological traits  <cit> . according to drew and hancock, b. philippinensis and b. occipitalis but not b. dorsalis s.s are distributed in the philippines  <cit> . however, in the present study, haplotype networks and phylogenetic evidence indicated no strong support for geographical subdivision within the b. philippinensis population. in this population, three b. philippinensis individuals and the entire b. dorsalis s.s. population  were found to belong to the same clade. however, five b. philippinensis individuals deviated from the b. dorsalis s.s. populations . mantel testing indicated that genetic differentiation was significantly influenced by geographical factors . geographic distance is probably responsible for this partitioning of genetic variation in the philippines.

invasion history
nucleotide diversity is the ideal index used to evaluate the degree of variation of nucleotide sites between populations  <cit> . dependence can be measured using sample size and sequence length, but genetic diversity can be measured using nucleotide diversity. nucleotide diversity is the average number of differences in the nucleotide sequence among individuals of a given population, compared pairwise. generally, ancestors show significantly more genetic diversity than derivative populations because of the founder effect  <cit> . according to this principle, it was here inferred that the populations of b. dorsalis s.s. from china might have originated in southeast asia  . the migrate analysis showed that gene flow occurred from manila to bangkok to phou to china. however, it occurred in an asymmetric manner. the asymmetric migration of gene flow probably indicates colonization events in china that may have involved multiple sources and sites of invasion. phylogenetic analysis provided another line of evidence for this: numerous southeast asian individuals belonged to the same clade as chinese populations . this conclusion is supported by studies showing that southeast asia might be the region of origin of b. dorsalis s.s <cit> . as in previous studies, the maximum genetic diversity was observed in southeast asia and yunnan province  <cit> . however, symmetric migration patterns were observed at a number of sites, distributed mainly in yunnan, guangdong, fujian, and taiwan. it is likely that these places may have been the first to be invaded. in conclusion, two distinct lineages of b. dorsalis s.s. were identified in the present investigation based on sequence data of nd <dig> gene. the asymmetric migration of gene flow indicated multiple invasions and multiple origins.

CONCLUSIONS
using mitochondrial dna nd <dig> markers, the genetic structure, origin, and invasion history of b. dorsalis s.s. were investigated. it was observed that distinct lineages  originated from specific southeast asian populations. interestingly, minor lineages have not spread in china. evidence was found indicating symmetrical migration from southeast asia to china. understanding origin and genetic structure of b. dorsalis s.s. will possibly assist in the development of effective management strategies to prevent biological invasion. source-tracking and minor distinct lineage “encounter” approaches may also provide better clues to the design of appropriate control methods, such as introducing natural enemies, to minimize biological invasion of b. dorsalis s.s. in china.
