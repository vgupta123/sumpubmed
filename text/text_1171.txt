BACKGROUND
recent developments in high-throughput genotyping technology  <cit>  and the discovery of large numbers of snps through sequencing of the cattle genome  <cit>  have generated enthusiasm and interest in genome-wide association mapping and marker-assisted selection in dairy cattle. mapping by association requires a population-based sample rather than specific families. association studies rely on the fact that alleles at loci that surround a quantitative trait nucleotide  tend to co-segregate. if the marker is sufficiently close to the qtn, the association remains intact in the majority of the individuals in the population, even after many generations. this non-random association between alleles at different loci is called linkage disequilibrium . such allelic associations are mostly due to physical proximity but are also affected by population history and evolutionary forces  <cit> . the main limitation of association analyses is the requirement for sufficient markers to provide a high chance of identifying markers in ld with all important qtn. the marker density required for a successful association analysis, and for subsequent marker assisted selection , depends on the extent of ld across the genome.

several measures of ld have been devised  <cit> , and two measures, d' and r <dig>  each with different statistical properties  <cit> , are commonly used. both range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , but their interpretation is different. for biallelic markers, d' is equal to  <dig> if one or more of the four possible haplotypes is absent, and is <  <dig> if all four possible haplotypes are present. most studies in livestock have reported the extent of ld based on d'. d' is most useful for representing historical recombination patterns, which are central to determining the extent and pattern of ld over a genome. d' is especially helpful in understanding long-range ld. recently chen et al.  <cit>  suggested a volume measure of ld dvol equivalent to d' and reported that this measure is more robust when estimated from small samples.

the measure r represents the statistical correlation between two sites, and takes the value of  <dig>  for a pair of biallelic markers if only two haplotypes are present within a population. hence in order for r <dig> to be  <dig>  allelic frequencies of the two snps in question need to be identical in addition to both being in ld. the power of association mapping is inversely proportional to r <dig>  and to achieve the same power by typing a snp in ld with a qtn versus typing the qtn directly, the sample size must be increased by a factor of 1/r <dig>  <cit> . however, if more than one snp is used to predict the effect of a qtn, then the association between the qtn and haplotypes is more informative.

the average extent of ld in the human genome has been extensively studied: it extends up to  <dig> kb but is highly variable, depending on the population and threshold used to measure ld  <cit> . studies on ld in cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit> , horse  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and chicken  <cit>  have shown that ld in livestock populations is much more extensive than in humans. this is mainly due to smaller effective population size and, in some circumstances, stronger selection that has recently occurred in livestock populations  <cit> .

the estimates of ld reported in cattle are mostly based on microsatellite markers. ld in humans estimated from snp markers has been reported to be smaller than estimates from microsatellites  <cit> . there is limited information available on the extent of ld between snp markers in cattle and it is mainly limited to regions used in fine mapping  <cit>  or for a single chromosome  <cit> . furthermore, studies in cattle have usually involved relatively small sample sizes which are both subject to bias and loss of accuracy when estimating d' and r2; and such bias may vary with inter-marker distance. finally, effects of minor allele frequency  of snp loci on estimates of ld have not been reported in cattle.

in an ongoing gene discovery program in dairy cattle, a panel of  <dig> holstein-friesian bulls was genotyped for  <dig>  snps using a high-throughput genotyping service  <cit> . this data set was recently described and used for the construction of a bovine hapmap  <cit> . the present paper presents additional results of ld analyses of this genotype data. this study explores the effect of maf and sample size on ld parameters and suggests the minimum sample size required for useful estimates. we also compare a recently suggested volume measure of ld  <cit>  to the more commonly used statistics. public-domain snp data from mice and humans are also analysed to compare ld from different mammalian species using the same statistics and methods.

RESULTS
of a total of  <dig>  snps genotyped in this study,  <dig>  survived filtering on maf  and hwe . the distribution of snps on different chromosomes is summarised in table  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> on bta <dig> to  <dig> on bta <dig>  the overall mean maf was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the distribution of maf over the genome is approximately uniform , consistent with the ascertainment of snp discovery identifying primarily the common snps within the bovine genome. the genomic coordinates of each snp, together with its maf, are available in additional file  <dig> 

the values in the parentheses of swept radius are confidence interval of swept radius.

adj means estimate between adjacent snps only.

linkage disequilibrium among syntenic snp pairs
two of the most commonly used measures of ld, d' and r <dig>  were estimated for each pair-wise combination of snps on each chromosome : a total of  <dig> , <dig> pairs were analyzed for all autosomes. the mean values of d' and r <dig> for individual autosomes are presented in table  <dig>  the mean d' and r <dig>  pooled over autosomes  in different categories of map distances, are summarized in table  <dig>  similar tables for individual chromosomes are provided in additional file  <dig>  the distribution of d' and r <dig> with respect to the physical distance separating loci is presented in figures 1a and 1b, respectively. as expected, there is a gradual decline in d' with increasing physical distance between snps: for snps up to  <dig> kb apart, the mean d' is  <dig> ; for snps separated by 200– <dig> kb the mean d' is  <dig> , and for snps separated by more than  <dig> mb, the mean d' is  <dig> . the distribution of expected d' obtained from fitting the malécot model  <cit>  is also shown in figure 1a. from this distribution, the estimated swept radius  is  <dig>  mb.

compared to d', there is  a steeper decline in r <dig> with increasing distance between syntenic snps . the mean r <dig> across autosomes is  <dig>  ± . <dig>  a mean r <dig> above  <dig>  was observed only for snps less than  <dig> kb apart, and r <dig> declines rapidly with increasing distances. as can be seen in table  <dig>  starting from a maximum of  <dig>  for snps less than  <dig> kb apart,r <dig> reduces to less than 10% of this value for snps greater than  <dig> kb apart. the value of r <dig> at a distance of more than  <dig> mb  is close to average r <dig> among the non-syntenic pairs .

similar trends for d' and r <dig> are evident for all the individual autosomes, although there is variation in the trend of decline . heat maps for d' and r <dig> for individual chromosomes  clearly display variation in the pattern of ld across the genome. figure 2a and figure 2b compare the average ld in different distance bins of individual chromosomes with combined over genome. there is more variation in r <dig> across chromosomes at closer distance bins. the variation in ld across chromosomes suggests that inference of genome-wide ld based on single or few chromosomes can be biased. a different analysis of this variation in ld has recently been presented  <cit> . the swept radius for d' of individual chromosomes shows that ld is higher for the longer chromosomes than the shorter chromosomes . this can be explained by fewer recombinations per unit of physical distance in long chromosomes than in short chromosomes, as observed in the human genome.

a more robust measure of ld termed the volume measure of d'  has recently been proposed  <cit> . we computed dvol for all the syntenic pairs. since the value of d' and dvol were quite similar  in this data, the estimates of dvol are not presented here, can be obtained from corresponding author.

ld among non-syntenic snp pairs
the ld estimates for a sample of  <dig>  non-syntenic pairs  were computed. the mean d' for non-syntenic snps is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the distribution of d' for non-syntenic snp pairs presented in figure 3a indicates a larger proportion of non-syntenic pairs have small values of d'. the mean value r <dig> for non-syntenic snps is  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the distribution of r <dig> for non-syntenic pairs is shown in figure 3b. the comparison of d' and dvol estimated for non-syntenic snp pairs shows that both estimates are quite similar  for this sample .

the relationship between ld and average minor allelic frequency for non-syntenic snps
the estimate of d' seems to inflate with lower average minor allelic frequency  for non-syntenic snp pairs . there are  <dig>  percent of non-syntenic snp pairs with d' values above  <dig> . most of these d' values were observed for snp pairs with low average maf. however, there is no relationship between maf and ld expressed as r <dig> . it should be noted that all r <dig> values for non-syntenic pairs are very small. the maximum value for r <dig> observed for non-syntenic pairs is only  <dig> , and only  <dig> pairs  have an r <dig> value of more than  <dig> . similarly, we also analysed chi-squared for non-syntenic snp pairs and only small values of chi-squared were observed for the non-syntenic snp pairs . the proportion of non-syntenic pairs with a high d' value is small . however, of the pairs with a mean maf less than  <dig> ,  <dig>  percent have d' above  <dig>  and there are no pairs with r <dig> >  <dig> . these results suggest that d' is comparatively more sensitive to changes in maf due to the increased likelihood of a missing haplotype when maf is low. in contrast, r <dig> appears to be largely unaffected by low maf. the relationship between dvol and mean maf shows a similar trend to that for d' , indicating that dvol is also inflated for loci with rare alleles.

effect of maf on the extent of syntenic ld
the effect of maf on the extent of ld amongst syntenic snps was studied using three different minimum maf thresholds of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . minimum maf has a strong effect on mean r <dig> especially at short distances  . for example, for snps within 1– <dig> kb, the mean r <dig> was  <dig>  for maf ≥  <dig>  but was as high as  <dig>  for loci with maf ≥  <dig> . a likely explanation is that as the maf threshold increases, there is an increase in the number of snp pairs with similar allele frequencies, and, consequently, an increase in r <dig>  compared to r <dig>  there is an opposite effect of maf threshold on d' . there is almost no effect at close distances, especially up to  <dig> kb. however, at larger distances, higher maf thresholds are associated with lower values of mean d', which is consistent with earlier studies  <cit> .

comparison of ld in the cattle, mouse and human genomes
in order to compare the extent of ld in the bovine genome with mouse and human, we analysed some mouse and human snp genotyping data available in the public domain. although the extent of ld in cattle is much greater than in human , the pattern of decay in ld with distance is similar. in contrast, ld in a mouse population derived from the intercrossing of  <dig> inbred lines, maintained for  <dig> generations by pseudorandom matting  <cit> , shows extensive extended ld for both d' and r <dig>  the extent of ld in this population extends up to  <dig> mb for d', and for r <dig> useful ld of  <dig>  extended more than  <dig> mb. in the human data set, the distance to r <dig> =  <dig>  extends only to  <dig> kb.

discussion
this is a comprehensive study of ld with a high density snp panel in hf dairy cattle and currently reflects the best estimates of genome-wide ld in this breed based on number of animals screened and number of snps genotyped. the pairwise measures of ld decline over increasing distance between snps. the ld estimated by d' appears to be quite extensive and is much higher in cattle than in humans. this may be due to random drift caused by relatively small effective population in dairy cattle  <cit> . comparable estimates of extensive ld based on d' estimated from microsatellites have been reported in cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit> , horse  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> . the ld between snp markers reported in the present study is slightly smaller than that estimated between microsatellite markers in earlier studies  <cit>  and this may be explained in part by the differences in the mutation rate between these two types of markers and reflect the more recent origin of microsatellite polymorphisms. secondly this may be due to the higher power for detecting ld when using markers with many alleles  as compared to biallelic snp markers  <cit> . the difference in ld detected using snp and microsatellite loci was more pronounced in humans  <cit> .

the d' metric has been suggested as a good measure to explain the extent of ld in population and variation of ld over the genome  <cit> . however, individual values of d' are more influenced by variation in allele frequencies than for the r <dig> metric. this is reflected in the inflated d' values at low maf  <cit> . for non-syntenic snp pairs we observed higher values of d' for the pairs with low mean maf. it is known that snps of different mafs have different ld properties  <cit> . higher d' between loci with rare alleles is mainly due to population genetic effects  and to effects of sampling. smaller samples may fail to sample rare fourth gametes and, therefore, can inflate the d' estimate  <cit> . on the other hand snps with rare alleles tend to have lower r <dig> values. the inflated d' estimates between non-syntenic snps with rare alleles are probably due to the effect of sampling caused by random drift or the loss of rare haplotypes in sampling in the present study.

the decline in ld is much steeper for r <dig> than for d'. such differences in the pattern of d' and r <dig> over physical distances have previously been observed in humans  <cit> . these two measures, which have been widely used in practice, have different statistical properties  <cit> : d' focuses on historical recombination, which is central to defining the extent and pattern of ld over a genome. however, r <dig> is more useful for predicting the power of association mapping. to obtain the same power as obtained when testing the causative quantitative trait nucleotide /mutation, the sample size required for association mapping is inversely proportional to r <dig>  <cit> . from the pattern of decline of r <dig> the average useful ld for single-point association mapping in this population extends only up to  <dig> kb which suggests that at least  <dig>  snps are required for a whole genome association scan. at this distance r <dig> values between adjacent snps decrease to an average of ~ <dig>  . at this spacing a qtn would be at a maximum of  <dig> kb  from an adjacent snp which would give an average r <dig> of  <dig>   between snp and qtn. however, if more stringent criteria are considered for higher power genome scans, then the number of snps required would be  <dig>   and  <dig>   to obtain average r <dig> values between adjacent snps of  <dig>  , and  <dig>  , respectively. in addition there is a lot of variation in r <dig>  as indicated by the large standard deviation of r <dig> , within an interval of extent of ld considered. the 25th percentile of r <dig>  indicates that only  <dig> % of the pairs of snps in the 1– <dig> kb distance bin have r <dig> of more than  <dig> . similar low values of the 25th percentile are noted for other distance bins in table  <dig>  the variation in r <dig> in a distance bin is partly because of the variation in ld in different genomic regions. in addition r <dig> is dependent upon the matching allelic frequencies and are known to have very low values between markers even at very short distances  <cit> . this variation has been ignored in most studies while suggesting the number of snps required for genome scans based on average r <dig> . to accommodate this variation, more snps will need to be genotyped in each interval which will increase the estimate of the total number of snps required for association mapping. however, these partial correlations can be exploited using multi-markers haplotype analysis which provides more discriminatory power as compared to individual snps to detect putative causal mutation. recently mckay et al.  <cit>  suggested one snp every  <dig> kb to obtain an average r <dig> of  <dig> - <dig>  between adjacent snps. gautier et al.  <cit>  reported the ld analysis of  <dig> snps mostly located on one chromosome in  <dig> breeds and suggested a common panel of  <dig>  snps  for association mapping in different breeds similar to the requirement for a high power panel within-breed study as shown here.

the number of snps required for association mapping can be reduced by excluding some of the redundant snps, by optimally using the ld information present in the population. however, there are differences in the pattern of ld across the genome. this can be addressed more precisely by identifying tag snps based on haplotype block structure information, as was done in the human hapmap project  <cit> . an attempt to construct the haplotype block map of the bovine genome and the concomitant identification of tag snps from this dataset was presented by khatkar et al.  <cit>  but at present only covers a relatively small proportion of the bovine genome based on  <dig>  markers. genome-wide identification of tags snps for the whole genome would be possible from a saturated haplotype block map of the bovine genome. until such maps become available, the extent of ld as expressed by r <dig> can provide an interim guide for number and spacing of the snps over the genome.

the extent of ld within a genome can be affected by a number of factors. our results confirm that maf has direct effects on the estimation of extent of ld. the r <dig> between common snps is higher especially for snps at close physical distances. on the other hand d' between snps with low maf is higher at longer distances. similarly, sample size also affects the estimation of ld. the results in this study clearly indicate that the estimate of d' is affected most by sample size. it seems that for reliable estimates of d' a sample of  <dig> or more is required. similar observations were also made for dvol. the requirement of sample size would be even higher in human because of the larger effective population size. hence, it may be suggested that analyses utilizing d' matrix  should be based on a large sample size and preferably from within-breed group samples.

however, the identification of tag snps, which is generally based on r <dig> values, can be accomplished using smaller samples. similar estimates of correlations between the estimates of r <dig> were obtained from different samples in a simulation study by visscher  <cit> . similarly, a small sample size of  <dig> and above can provide precise estimate of maf for common snps in the population .

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted an extensive ld analysis using  <dig>  snps genotyped on  <dig> holstein frisian bulls. overall the extent of ld over different chromosomes was similar but varied in cattle. we compared three different measures of ld. all are affected by sample size although to different extents. we suggest that the sample size required to compute reliable estimates of d' or for any analysis  based on the d' matrix should be at least  <dig> samples. a similar sample size is required for dvol. however, it seems that r <dig> can be reliably estimated with smaller sample sizes of  <dig> individuals. based on the extent of decline of r <dig> we suggest more than  <dig>  snps would be required for low power association mapping in the holstein friesian population and up to  <dig>  snps for a high power study. the extent of ld in cattle is higher than in human, but much less than in a mouse population.
