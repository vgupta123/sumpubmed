BACKGROUND
lactobacillus salivarius
 <cit>  is a member of the indigenous microbiota of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract  of both humans and animals  <cit> , and has also been isolated from human breast milk  <cit> . the probiotic and immunomodulatory activity of l. salivarius strains has been recently reviewed  <cit>  and are considered to be strain-specific traits  <cit> . strains of l. salivarius are genetically diverse  <cit>  and harbour distinctive multireplicon genomes. the first genome of this species to be published  <cit>  was that of the well-characterised strain l. salivarius ucc <dig>  whose megaplasmid pmp <dig>  encodes genes involved in gi tract survival, fitness and probiotic activity . l. salivarius strains from a range of environmental sources harbour diverse circular megaplasmids  <cit> . at least  <dig> additional l. salivarius genomes have been sequenced since that of strain ucc118; three of these have been completed  with two being finished to a draft quality status  <cit> .

unlike circular plasmids, linear plasmids are rarely observed in lactobacilli  <cit>  but often confer advantageous phenotypes to their hosts  <cit>  and have been extensively studied in streptomyces
 <cit> , borrelia
 <cit>  and bacillus
 <cit> . linear phage genomes are also harboured by strains of escherichia coli
 <cit> , yersinia enterocolitica
 <cit> , klebsiella oxytoca
 <cit>  as well as the probiotic cheese strain lactobacillus paracasei nfbc  <dig>  <cit> . prior to the discovery of linear megaplasmids in l. salivarius
 <cit> , a 150 kb linear plasmid was identified in lactobacillus gasseri cnrz <dig>  <cit> ; but no characterization of the plasmid was performed. we previously identified linear megaplasmids in two porcine l. salivarius isolates, jcm <dig> and jcm <dig>  and one human intestinal isolate ah <dig>  <cit> .

the conjugative transposon  tn <dig>   <cit>  and other tn916-like elements are highly promiscuous  <cit> , both in the lab and in natural environments  <cit> . they have demonstrated intra- and interspecies transfer from lactococcus lactis
 <cit>  and lactobacillus paracasei
 <cit>  food strains; and between streptococcal species in dental biofilms  <cit> . there is a growing concern that commensal bacteria may act as natural reservoirs for antibiotic resistance determinants  <cit>  and may be responsible for transfer of antibiotic resistance to pathogens and opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . in addition to the introduction of additional functional modules to the host cell, cts have further potential to influence natural selection within a bacterial population  <cit> . there is therefore a growing need to characterize these mobile elements, particularly in species used in food or as probiotics.

here we present experimental evidence for a highly unusual genome architecture in l. salivarius jcm <dig>  a strain that harbours multiple extrachromosomal replicons of varying sizes and topologies and which has an enhanced ability to withstand the stresses associated with git survival  <cit> . the present study describes an unprecedented level of genome complexity in l. salivarius.

RESULTS
discovery of circular and linear extrachromosomal elements in l. salivariusjcm1046
sequencing revealed that l. salivarius jcm <dig> contains five replicons : a  <dig>  mb chromosome, two circular megaplasmids of  <dig> and 129 kb, a linear megaplasmid of 101 kb, and a 33 kb plasmid harbouring an integrated conjugative transposon . the complexity of this genome configuration presented extraordinary challenges for genome assembly, described below. experimental validation of the genome structure is presented in figure  <dig>  l. salivarius strains jcm <dig> and ah <dig> were known to harbour linear megaplasmids that were presumed to be related to plmp <dig>  <cit>  and were therefore included in these experiments.table  <dig>

genome atlas of the plasmids of
l. salivarius
jcm <dig>  a graphical representation of each plasmid in the l. salivarius jcm <dig> genome was generated using dnaplotter  <cit> . genes on the forward and reverse strands ; pseudogenes ; gc% ; gc skew  are illustrated for each replicon. genes encoded by the plasmid backbone of pctn <dig> are also green, the genes present on the integrated conjugative transposon tn <dig> are represented as follows: conjugative transfer , accessory genes , transcriptional regulation  and recombination .
confirmation of the genome architecture of
l. salivarius
jcm <dig>   pfge gels of enzyme-treated gdna of strains jcm <dig>  jcm <dig> and ah <dig>  corresponding southern hybridizations using replicon-specific probes are shown directly below each gel . the probes used for the southern hybridizations targeted the following genes: the repb gene of pmp1046b , an endonuclease gene in plmp <dig>  and a region spanning the int-xis genes of pctn <dig> . none of the probes employed showed cross hybridisation with non-target replicons. s <dig> nuclease , smai , sphi , psti  were used individually or in combination to determine the plasmid profiles of each strain. untreated samples of gdna are denoted by . closed-black arrowheads indicate λ dna concatamers used as size standards  . chromosomal dna bands of each strain are seen migrating to the equivalent of the 1 mb marker . open-black arrows indicate the s <dig> nuclease-linearised repa megaplasmids in each strain examined . a repb-type megaplasmid was found to be present in strain jcm <dig> but absent from strains jcm <dig> and ah <dig> . both s1-treated and untreated gdna samples of jcm <dig>  jcm <dig> and ah <dig> show the presence of linear plasmids of 140 kb, 140 kb and 175 kb respectively , each of which hybridise to a plmp1046-derived probe . s1-nuclease, sphi and psti were independently used to linearise pctn <dig>  . a probe based on the int and xis genes of pctn <dig> binds to the linear form of pctn <dig> . pctn <dig> does not have a smai site and is retained in the well in its circular form in the smai-digested sample.



our original study that identified pmp1046a  in strain jcm <dig> estimated its size as 230 kb, based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis   <cit> . however, the assembled sequence data revealed pmp1046a as closer to 220 kb in size. a combination of restriction digestion, pfge and southern hybridisation was used to validate the size of pmp1046a. apai was used to linearise the replicon prior to pfge and southern blot analysis. probes associated with the replication origin of pmp1046a hybridised to a band that migrated to a constant position between the 194 kb and  <dig>  kb linear λ dna markers, which was in keeping with the expected  <dig>  bp size indicated by dna sequencing.

we identified two novel plasmids pmp1046b and pctn <dig> from the genome sequence. a large contig  was assembled that could not be experimentally determined to form part of either the chromosome or previously described plasmid content of strain jcm <dig>  <cit> . this contig harboured plasmid-associated replication and maintenance proteins. a pcr product off the ends of this contig was generated and subsequently sequenced  which proved that the assembled contig was circular in the cell, and it was designated pmp1046b. under the pfge conditions that are routinely used to visualise the plasmid content of l. salivarius strains, pm1046b had previously gone undetected  <cit>  possibly because it was masked by the linear replicon plmp <dig>  <cit> .

we employed restriction digestion and s <dig> nuclease treatment in conjunction with pfge and southern blot analysis to confirm the sizes and topologies of the plasmids present in jcm <dig>  figure  <dig> panels a and b illustrate the identification of a repb-type megaplasmid in jcm <dig>  panels c and d display the linear plasmids of jcm <dig>  jcm <dig> and ah <dig>  and panels e and f illustrate the size and topolgy of pctn <dig>  chromosomal dna bands of strains jcm <dig>  jcm <dig> and ah <dig> migrate to the equivalent of the 1 mb marker . s <dig> nuclease preferentially nicks and linearises megaplasmids due to inherent torsional stresses  <cit> . the linearised form of the repa-type circular megaplasmids of the l. salivarius strains are indicated by the open black arrows in figure  <dig> panels a, c and e.

when an increased band intensity or band width is observed in a pfge gel, it is often indicative of the presence of linear dna, high copy number extrachromosomal elements or co-migrating bands of similarly sized dna fragments  <cit> . strain jcm <dig> gdna revealed high-intensity bands in the s1-treated sample at a position just below the  <dig>  kb lambda dna marker. this band represents the overlapping linear forms of pmp1046b and plmp <dig>  in the untreated sample of jcm <dig>  the circular form of pmp1046b is retained in the well; therefore the repb gene probe binds only to the well but not to the migrating linear plasmid plmp <dig> . however, in the s1-nuclease treated gdna sample of jcm <dig>  the repb probe hybridised strongly to the overlapping plmp1046/pmp1046b bands , thereby confirming that the discrete replicons plmp <dig> and pmp1046b appear as one overlapping 120 kb band in their linear forms . the repb probe did not hybridise to the lanes containing jcm <dig> or ah <dig> gdna, indicating that these strains lack a second repb-type circular megaplasmid . the presence of a second circular megaplasmid has also been reported in strains nias <dig> and smxd <dig>  both of these strains being of animal origin  <cit> .

both s1-treated and untreated gdna samples of jcm <dig>  jcm <dig> and ah <dig> show the presence of linear plasmids: plmp <dig> , plmp <dig>  and plmp <dig>  respectively . each of the linear plasmids hybridised to a gene probe derived from the plmp <dig> sequence .

a conjugative transposon in l. salivariusjcm1046
we further identified a 33 kb plasmid in strain jcm <dig> that was not previously observed in the plasmid profile of strain jcm <dig>  <cit>  and that was identified here by de novo scaffold assembly and designated pctn <dig>  it harbours a tn916-like element and was experimentally determined to have a circular topology. in silico analysis was first used to identify restriction enzymes whose use would resolve the chromosomal dna of jcm <dig> from that of pctn <dig>  sphi and psti each cut the chromosome multiple times, while linearising pctn <dig>  following treatment, pctn <dig> is visible as a band which migrates to a position between the  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, in keeping with the assembled 33 kb size of pctn <dig> . the chromosome of jcm <dig> has multiple smai restriction sites, while pctn <dig> has none. the multiple dna bands in the smai-treated gdna sample  are chromosomal fragments, while the uncut circular form of pctn <dig> was retained in the well. a probe spanning the int and xis genes of pctn <dig> hybridised strongly to the 33 kb bands in the s1-nuclease, sphi and psti treated samples of jcm <dig> . similarly, the same probe hybridised to the circular form of pctn <dig> retained in the well of the smai-treated sample, but did not hybridise to the migrating chromosomal bands . the same pattern of hybridisation was obtained when the experiment was repeated with a probe based on the tetm gene harboured by pctn <dig> . although tn916-like elements have been shown to insert at a single site in some species, in almost all bacterial hosts they insert at multiple sites  <cit> . our data indicate that the conjugative transposon in strain jcm <dig> is integrated at a single site in pctn <dig> and is absent from the rest of the genome.

general genome features of l. salivariusjcm1046
the unusual genome complexity of jcm <dig> raised questions about gene distribution by replicon. bioinformatic analysis identified  <dig>  coding sequences in the chromosome, a coding density of  <dig> % . biological functions could not be assigned to  <dig> of these protein coding sequences. the chromosome of l. salivarius jcm <dig> contains  <dig> pseudogenes . seven rrna operons were identified on the chromosome, as well as  <dig> trna genes for all  <dig> amino acids. the chromosome has an average gc content of  <dig> %, with three regions displaying atypical gc content relative to the rest of the genome .

the largest of the plasmids pmp1046a has a coding density of  <dig> %.  <dig> coding sequences were identified,  <dig> of which were for hypothetical proteins. pmp1046a contains  <dig> pseudogenes . the gene content of pmp1046a will be discussed in detail below.

we identified  <dig> coding regions in pmp1046b, though biological function could only be assigned to  <dig> %, the vast majority  of genes remaining cryptic. the gc% content of pmp1046b  correlates well with the  <dig> % gc content of the jcm <dig> chromosome  suggesting long-term adaptation to the host cell, or acquisition from a bacterium with a similar % gc content. in addition to harbouring plasmid-associated replication machinery, pmp1046b harbours additional housekeeping and information-related genes, thus fulfilling the criteria for extrachromosomal elements known as chromids  <cit> . pmp1046b encodes two trna genes, trna   and trna   but these genes are not uniquely present on pmp1046b i.e. they are paralogs of chromosomally encoded genes. gene duplication can offer a level of genomic redundancy to a strain that is adapting to a new environment  <cit> , and the trna genes encoded by pmp1046b may enable jcm <dig> to respond more rapidly to changing environmental conditions. plmp <dig> harbours  <dig> coding sequences, none of which were pseudogenes. however,  <dig> of the predicted coding sequence products were annotated as hypothetical proteins, some of which may represent remnants of functional genes. the average gc content of plmp <dig>  is significantly lower than that of the jcm <dig> chromosome , implying these replicons experienced distinct evolutionary histories and that plmp <dig> may be a recent acquisition.

pfge analysis predicted the size of plmp <dig> to be approximately 130 kb , but sequencing revealed a replicon that was 102 kb. it is reasonable to assume that this discrepancy and the lack of identifiable terminal inverted repeats   is an assembly artifact due to omission of the presumptive repeat sequences in the terminal regions of plmp <dig>  the problems faced in the sequencing of the telomeres of linear elements are well recognised  <cit> .

in keeping with the guidelines outlined by roberts et al.
 <cit>  the novel conjugative transposon contained within pctn <dig> was designated tn <dig>  in silico analysis predicted a coding density of 76% for pctn <dig>  thirty-nine coding sequences were identified , the majority of which  are linked to the integrated transposon. the sole pseudogene harboured by this replicon lies outside the tn <dig> region and shows similarity to nitroreductase family proteins. the plasmid backbone of pctn <dig> has an average gc content of  <dig> %, whereas tn <dig> has an average gc content of  <dig> %. unsurprisingly, this suggests that tn <dig> was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer . insertion of tn916-like elements is not random, with the insertion sites differing from species to species  <cit> , but generally displaying a distinct preference for target sites which are a-t rich and that have a limited homology with the ends of the element  <cit> . as only one copy of tn <dig> was found in the genome of jcm <dig>  a putative consensus of the target sequence in l. salivarius could not be determined. accounting for the potential presence of coupling sequences, the 35 bp that flanked either end of tn <dig> was examined to determine if the target sites in l. salivarius are in keeping with those generally described for these elements  <cit> . the at content of the sequences upstream and downstream of tn <dig> were found to be  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, indicating that the target site for tn <dig> is likely to be similar to those of other species  <cit> .

phage, transposases and crispr regions
phast  <cit>  identified two regions of bacteriophage-related dna in the genome of jcm <dig>  both found on the chromosome of jcm <dig>  in addition to a  <dig>  kb remnant prophage that spans residues 1378015–1400296 bp, an intact  <dig>  kb prophage was also identified on the chromosome which spans residues 1439831–1444300 bp. at  <dig> %, the remnant prophage is one of the three regions of atypical gc content.

 <dig> transposases , representing eight is families were found distributed across four of the five replicons of strain jcm <dig>  the distribution of transposases is detailed in additional file  <dig> 

clusters of regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats  and crispr-associated genes  provide the host with acquired and heritable resistance against genetic transformation, phage and plasmid proliferation  <cit> . one crispr associated system  was identified on the chromosome of jcm <dig> at position 810173–812140 bp, consisting of a 1059 bp repeat locus composed of a 36 bp direct repeat and  <dig> spacers. this crispr region is immediately upstream of the gene encoding cas <dig> and immediately downstream of eight additional crispr-associated protein coding genes.

replication of extrachromosomal elements
the replication region of pmp1046a extends from lsj_ <dig> to lsj_ <dig> . the gene content and organisation of the replication region of pmp1046a is highly similar to ) that of pmp <dig>  <cit>  and to those of other sequenced l. salivarius strains . pmp1046a is likely to replicate by theta-form replication  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
a comparison eight
repa
-type megaplasmids of
l. salivarius. a blast atlas diagram of eight repa-type megaplasmids of l. salivarius was generated using blast ring image generator   <cit> , using pmp1046a as the reference replicon . working inwards from pmp1046a, the next seven rings represent query repa-type plasmids of l. salivarius strains: cp <dig>  pmp <dig>  pmp <dig>  phn <dig>  pmpgj- <dig>  pna <dig>  pls51a. when the completed or circularised version of the repa-type megaplasmid was not available , all available sequence data for each strain was mapped to pmp1046a. regions of diversity between the repa-type megaplasmids are indicated by the labels r1-r <dig>  the gc% of pmp1046a was projected onto the mapped plasmid sequences  and sits outside the molecular clock surrounding the figure legend at the centre of the figure.



the predicted replication region of pmp1046b spans residues 128175–1974 bp of the plasmid. this region includes a repa gene  at the position of a switch in gc skew that is characteristic of replication origins  <cit> . lsj_ <dig> shares 36-56% aa id with l. salivarius repa protein sequences. the repa protein of pmp1046b also displays 40% aa id to the repa protein of the pig isolate lactobacillus reuteri atcc  <dig>  <cit> . the second gene in the pmp1046b ori region, lsj_ <dig> encodes a predicted partitioning/copy control protein, repb.

analysis of plmp <dig> indicates that it shares limited sequence homology or gene synteny with linear replicons of other species. however, given the lack of sequenced counterparts in other lactobacilli, the absence of homologous genes in databases is unsurprising. replication is commonly initiated from one or more internal ori sites in linear plasmids and proceeds bidirectionally towards the telomeres . our previous study indicated that the linear plasmids of l. salivarius did not harbour the repa and repe genes encoded by the circular repa-type megaplasmids of l. salivarius
 <cit> , and thus it was presumed that plmp <dig> utilised an alternate mode of replication to the circular plasmids of l. salivarius
 <cit> . sequence analysis identified two plasmid-associated replication genes encoded by plmp <dig>  lsj_ <dig>  and lsj_ <dig> . lsj_ <dig> exhibits 39-41% aa id with proteins annotated as either repe or repa in the circular megaplasmids of l. salivarius. this level of sequence homology was not high enough to cause cross hybridisation between the replication genes of pmp <dig> and the repa/e gene identified in plmp <dig>  thus accounting for the observations of our previous study  <cit> . lsj_ <dig> encodes a putative repb-like replication initiator protein. the replication origins of streptomyces linear plasmids are comprised of helicase-like rep genes and interons  <cit> , while the replication ori of n <dig> is located within the repa gene, which acts as a multifunctional protein combining primase, helicase and origin-binding activities  <cit> . repa boxes were not identified in the proximity of either the repa or repb genes of plmp1046; however, the genomic region immediately upstream of the repa coincides with a switch in gc skew. this suggests that the repa gene lies within the putative ori region of plmp <dig> 

the mechanism that plmp <dig> uses to prevent the progressive shortening of their telomeres after each cycle of replication is unknown. it is possible it employs a circular mode, as in some streptomyces linear plasmids  <cit> , but it is more plausible that the sequence of plmp <dig> is missing sections of its terminal regions due to a sequencing or assembly artefact. further analysis of the terminal regions of plmp <dig> will be required to fully elucidate the mechanism involved in the replication of l. salivarius linear plasmids.

there are two replication associated genes harboured by the plasmid backbone of pctn <dig> which are separated by approximately 6 kb. lsj_5030c shares 52% aa id with a replication-associated protein in lactobacillus amylovorus grl  <dig>  lsj_5035c encodes the plasmid associated replication protein, repb, the gene for which coincides with the position of a switch in gc skew, and is therefore the presumed to be the replication origin of pctn <dig>  lsj_5035c shares 36% aa id with the repb protein of l. lactis subsp. cremoris tifn <dig> and 100% aa id to a replication initiation protein in the  <dig>  kb plasmid pls51c in l. salivarius smxd <dig> 

plasmid maintenance
several of the jcm <dig> plasmids encode genes implicated in plasmid incompatibility. three of the plasmids  encode a repb-like gene, two  encode repe-like genes and two  encode repa-like genes. however the presumptive replication regions of the co-resident plasmids display low levels of sequence id with the highest nt id shared between the repb genes of plmp <dig> and pctn <dig> at  <dig> %. the mosaic nature of the replication regions as well as the lack of nucleotide homology between the respective replication associated genes of the co-resident plasmids is a plausible explanation for the compatibility of the plasmids that co-exist in strain jcm <dig>  several complete toxin-antitoxin  systems were identified on plasmids pmp1046a and plmp <dig> and likely play a role in the stability and maintenance of the co-resident plasmids in jcm <dig> 

comparative l. salivariusgenomics and relationship to phenotype
chromosome
in contrast to the human probiotic strains l. salivarius ucc <dig> and l. salivarius cect  <dig> which share  <dig> % nt pairwise id between their chromosomes and  <dig> % nt pairwise id between their repa-type megaplasmids, the genome structure, and sequence of jcm <dig> diverges significantly from the other published l. salivarius strains.

the chromosome of jcm <dig> shares  <dig> % nt pairwise id with strain ucc <dig> and includes  <dig> regions   <cit> , representing  <dig> % of the chromosome, that are absent from strain ucc <dig> . indeed, a comparison of the chromosome of strain jcm <dig> to that of the other published l. salivarius genome sequences revealed  <dig> chromosomally encoded genes in jcm <dig> that were absent in the other published l. salivarius genomes . these genes primarily belong to categories of genes that have been shown to be hypervariable among l. salivarius strains  <cit>  and other lactobacillus species  <cit>  and include transposases, phage-associated genes, and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and host interaction . the gc% map of the jcm <dig> chromosome identifies three regions with significantly deviating gc content, one of which is the remnant prophage that is resident on the chromosome. the smallest of these regions stretches from residues  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. this  <dig>  kb region has a gc% content of  <dig> % and encodes a protein containing a mucin-binding mucbp domain , several transposases, hypothetical proteins and a choloylglycine hydrolase . although present in the porcine strains jcm <dig> and cp <dig>  this region is absent from other sequenced genomes of l. salivarius and may represent a niche specific adaptation.

bsh <dig> is one of two choloylglycine hydrolase genes encoded by the genome of jcm <dig>  <cit> ; the second  is present on pmp1046a and is widespread among l. salivarius strains  <cit> . in contrast, bsh <dig> has only been identified in three isolates to date, jcm <dig>  lmg <dig> and cp <dig>  all of which are of animal origins. bsh <dig> confers jcm <dig> with an ability to resist much higher concentrations of the major human conjugated bile acids when compared to strains that harbour bsh <dig> alone  <cit> . in addition, bsh <dig> has recently been shown to reduce weight gain and serum ldl cholesterol and liver triglycerides in mice fed normal or high-fat diets  <cit> .

we have previously shown that exopolysaccharide  production levels and the presence of associated genes vary widely in l. salivarius
 <cit> . jcm <dig> harbours a single eps gene cluster that spans 33 kb, containing  <dig> genes, including two pseudogenes . the eps locus exhibits an atypical gc content relative to the rest of the chromosome,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

pmp1046a
nine substantial regions of sequence diversity, ranging in size from  <dig> - <dig>  kb were identified between pmp1046a and the sequences of the other published repa-type megaplasmids . hypothetical proteins and transposases are abundant within these regions . indeed, region two and region four primarily harbour hypothetical proteins, while region six harbours only is elements . regions three and eight mostly encode solute transporters .table  <dig>

genes associated with the regions of diversity  in pmp1046a, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  genes present on the reverse strand are denoted by the suffix c following the locus tag . pseudogenes are denoted by . numbers in italics represents the size of the region in bp.



the largest region of diversity among the strains examined is  <dig>  kb  and harbours several genes predicted to work synergistically with chromosomally encoded pathways to broaden the metabolic capabilities of strain jcm <dig>  although present in strain cp <dig>  this region is highly divergent in all other examined plasmids  and primarily encodes proteins involved in aa metabolism. jcm <dig> is prototrophic for l-proline due to the presence of a chromosomally-encoded pathway. three paralogous genes  in this region are responsible for the interconversion of l-proline to d-proline. also present in this region are two genes  which work in conjunction with the chromosomally encode gene  to synthesise l-selenocysteine. these increased biosynthetic capabilities are likely to enhance the ability of jcm <dig> to thrive in the competitive porcine git.

the genes present in regions five and nine  are primarily involved in the metabolism and transport of carbohydrates, and vary from strain to strain . similarly to pmp <dig>  pmp1046a harbours both single copy and paralogous genes that complete a number of the carbohydrate fermentative pathways that are partially encoded by the chromosome of jcm1046a. these include the pentose phosphate and gluconeogenesis pathways as well as the fermentation pathways for sorbitol and rhamnose.

bacteriocin production is a putative probiotic trait of l. salivarius strains . the genetic organisation of the  <dig>  kb bacteriocin locus in pmp1046a is analogous to that of the abp <dig> locus in the human isolate ucc <dig> . the structural genes  of the bacteriocin locus of pmp1046a, are identical to the genes  which are responsible for the production of the two-component antilisterial bacteriocin salivaricin p. this bacteriocin differs in sequence to abp <dig> by two amino acids  <cit>  and is produced by several other porcine isolates of l. salivarius
 <cit> . however, a frame-shift in the abpt gene  of jcm <dig> is likely responsible for the bacteriocin negative phenotype observed in this strain  <cit> .

pctn1046
the conjugative element tn <dig> harboured by plasmid pctn <dig> shares  <dig> % nt sequence id with the conjugative element tn <dig> and lacks only two genes which encode hypothetical proteins in the conjugative region of tn <dig>  when comparing pctn <dig> to other sequenced l. salivarius genomes, pctn <dig> shares  <dig> % nt id with the  <dig>  kb plasmid pls51c harboured by the probiotic avian isolate smdx <dig>  <cit> . this plasmid shares sequence homology with both the plasmid backbone and conjugative element of pctn <dig> . tn <dig> appears to be functionally intact, containing the: conjugative, recombination, transcriptional regulation and accessory genes  associated with tn <dig>  in contrast the integrated conjugative element that is resident in psl51c appears to be a remnant of a conjugative element as it lacks the recombination genes xis  and int . pls51c harbours a limited number of the conjugative genes present in tn <dig> and tn <dig> but lacks the arda gene present in pctn <dig> which has been recently shown to aid the transfer of mobile genetic elements  between unrelated bacterial species  <cit> . a putative tngbs1-like element  was identified in l. salivarius strain dsm <dig>  however, our analysis suggests that the contig predicted to harbour tnlsal <dig>   <cit>  forms part of the putative pmp <dig> megaplasmid in the type-strain l. salivarius dsm <dig>  the weak homology between the proteins identified in tnlsal <dig>  and those identified in other tngbs1-like elements  <cit>  may be due to their similar functional roles in their respective replicons.figure  <dig>

l. salivarius strains are increasingly being examined for their probiotic properties in both humans and animals  <cit> . dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes via the food chain to either the resident microbiota of the human gut or pathogenic bacteria is likely to have far reaching effects on both human and animal health and present a major financial cost  <cit> . thus, the identification of conjugative transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes in the genomes of two animal isolates of l. salivarius may have repercussions for strain selection in future probiotic studies.

pmp1046b and plmp1046
plasmids pmp1046b and plmp <dig> share neither sequence homology nor gene synteny with the additional l. salivarius plasmids sequenced to date. both of these replicons require further functional characterisation to determine whether or not they have an impact on the phenotype and ecological properties of jcm <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the porcine strain jcm <dig> harbours the most structurally complex multipartite genome identified in l. salivarius to date. through complete sequencing and assembly of the genome of jcm <dig> we identified two additional replicons that were not previously known to form part of the plasmid complement of this strain, and that would probably not have been identified by the high-coverage draft genome sequencing commonly applied. we determined that one of these replicons, pmp1046b is a candidate chromid, though much of its gene function remains cryptic. the plasmids of l. salivarius probably confer on their host many of the genes associated with niche adaptation and which are known to modulate the phenotype of a strain significantly. jcm <dig> was found to harbour both plasmid-encoded  and chromosomally encoded genes associated with adaptation to the git environment. the putative replication ori of plmp <dig> was identified and the sequence of this linear plasmid will provide a genetic platform for the study of linear dna replication in lactobacillus sp. an integrated conjugative transposon , carrying tetracycline resistance was identified in plasmid pctn <dig>  the first described in a sequenced l. salivarius genome. it will be interesting to see how prevalent tn6224-like elements are within the l. salivarius population, as more genome sequences become available.
