BACKGROUND
small bacterial rnas  have recently been shown to participate in the regulation of gene expression, and have been identified in numerous prokaryotic species  <cit> . they act mainly by antisense base pairing with their target mrnas, often within a complex comprising the sm-like rna chaperone hfq  <cit>  or by direct binding to proteins resulting in the modulation of their activity  <cit> . some srnas are involved in the regulation of virulence in several pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . these srnas function either directly on virulence genes or on their regulators. they act in parallel with protein regulatory systems in order to fine-tune the expression of virulence genes. for example, the staphylococcus aureus rnaiii regulatory rna is the effector molecule of the quorum sensing system arg, composed of a two-component system  sensing a small autoinducing peptide, which binds and activates argc. this autoinducing peptide is processed from the propeptide  by the peptidase   <cit> .

in this work we focused on the pathogenic bacterium bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, which remains an important global health problem, with up to  <dig>  annual deaths and approximately  <dig> million cases each year  <cit> . most deaths occur in young, unvaccinated children, but the incidence is also increasing in vaccinated populations, with regular epidemic outbreaks since the  <dig> s  <cit> . several causes have been attributed to this resurgence, including increased awareness and improved diagnostics of the disease, waning of vaccine-induced immunity and pathogen adaptation  <cit> .

a large proportion of bordetella genes undergo a change in their expression during the infectious cycle  <cit>  some of which correspond to phenotypic modulation under the control of a two-component system named bvga/bvgs . in this system bvgs acts as a sensor anchored in the inner membrane and bvga as the transcriptional activator  <cit> . so far, little is known about srnas in bordetella and their potential role in virulence or adaptation. only three bordetella srnas have been identified, the 6s rna  <cit> , the tmrna  <cit>  and a srna discovered by serendipity and lying in the opposite direction of the bvga/s mrna 5' untranslated region   <cit> . the aim of this study was to scan the b. pertussis genome in order to identify potential srnas and to investigate whether some of them might be related to bacterial virulence. we used a general bioinformatics approach  <cit>  and predicted  <dig> locations putatively bearing srna genes in intergenic regions  of the b. pertussis genome. transcription was confirmed by northern blot analyses for  <dig> of these locations. we further studied the expression of these new srnas under phenotypic modulation and showed that one of them is under the control of the bvga/bvgs system, suggesting its role in virulence.

methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
the genome sequences of b. pertussis tohamai, bordetella parapertussis  <dig>  bordetella bronchesipteca rb <dig>  <cit>  and bordetella avium n <dig>  <cit>  were used in the computational analyses.

b. pertussis bpsm, a streptomycin-resistant derivative of tohamai  <cit> , and bplow, an avirulent bvgas deletion mutant  <cit> , were grown as previously described  <cit>  at 37°c in modified stainer-scholte medium, containing  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin . cultures were stopped either at early , exponential  or stationary phase  by adding  <dig> ml of 5: <dig>  phenol/ethanol to  <dig> ml of culture medium. after centrifugation for  <dig> min. at  <dig> × g the pellets were stored at -80°c until further use.

for phenotypic modulation a 630-ml culture was grown in the same conditions until an od <dig> nm of approximately  <dig> . the culture was then split into three, and phenotypic modulation was induced by adding  <dig> ml of a pre-warmed  <dig> mm nicotinic acid  or  <dig> ml of pre-warmed  <dig> mm mgso <dig>  in the two first sub-cultures. the third sub-culture served as control and received  <dig> ml of sterile water pre-warmed at 37°c. culturing was then continued at 37°c, and samples were taken for rna extraction, just before induction  and at t =  <dig> min.,  <dig> min.,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-induction.

in silico search of srnas
the bacterial genome sequences and annotation files were obtained from the ncbi databases  <cit>  and from the sanger institute  <cit> . gene coordinates were used to extract igrs using a parser in perl. homologous regions of these igr sequences were searched in different bacterial genomes using local blast. hits presenting more than 60% sequence identity over at least  <dig> nucleotides were analyzed further. a multiple alignment of these homologous regions was then obtained using clustalw. these alignments were used to evaluate secondary structure conservation and thermodynamic stability using the software "rnaz" developed by washietl et al.  <cit> .

rna extraction and northern blot analyses
the bacterial pellets were resuspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mg/ml lysozyme . total rna was then extracted using the tri reagent kit , following the recommendations of the supplier. the rna quality was checked using bioanalyzer  <dig>  before denaturation and electrophoresis  on a 10% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide  denaturing gel in  <dig>  × tbe buffer in the presence of  <dig> m urea. the rna was then transferred onto brightstar plus  nylon membranes and uv-crosslinked. biotinylated oligonucleotides , designed using fastpcr  <cit> , were then used for hybridization in northern max buffer , and the blots were developed by chemiluminescent detection using the brightstar biodetect kit .

local dna alignment
homology searches were performed with the program yass  <cit>  in local using the default parameters.

for the similarity search of the bprj <dig> sequence, the program yass was used on the web server  <cit>  using the default parameters, except for the 'hit criterion strategy', which was set on 'double hit'. the sequence of the igr containing bprj <dig>  was searched for homology in the b. pertussis genome. the homologous regions were then aligned using clustalw, and the sequence closest to the consensus sequence  was used as a query for the search in all bacterial genome sequences.

for the global sequence similarity search, the b. pertussis igr sequences longer than  <dig> nucleotides and not containing trna or rrna genes were compared using yass with all complete bacterial genome sequences available in genbank, except those of the bordetella genus. hits with a score > <dig> and with >70% identity were considered further.

RESULTS
in silico prediction of srnas and validation by northern blot analysis
except for the 6s rna  <cit> , the tmrna  <cit>  and a small rna transcribed in antisense to the bvga mrna  <cit> , no srna has been identified so far in bordetella. we used the 'rnaz' algorithm  <cit> , which is based on a search for structure conservation between closely related bacterial genomes. predictions using different combinations of betaproteobacteria genomes resulted in various numbers of candidates. we choose to work on a prediction obtained comparing genomes of b. pertussis tohama i, b. bronchiseprica rb <dig>  b. parapertussis  <dig> and b. avium 197n. this search resulted in the prediction of  <dig> sequences for potential srnas in the b. pertussis genome . the same search strategy using only b. pertussis tohama i, b. bronchiseprica rb <dig> and b. parapertussis  <dig> resulted in  <dig> predictions. among the  <dig> predicted sequences, the position of the 6s rna gene was correctly designated , as well as the position of  <dig> riboswitches already described in the rfam database  <cit> . the first, gcvt, is selectively triggered by glycine  <cit>  and controls the translation of the aminomethyltransferase mrna . the second riboswitch belongs to the flavin mononucleotide  class  <cit>  and regulates the translation of ribb .

validation by northern blot analysis
all  <dig> predicted regions, except the ones of the gcvt riboswitch, the fmn riboswitch and the 6s rna, were tested for transcription of small-size rna by northern blot analyses. biotinylated oligonucleotide probes were designed for both strands of the  <dig> predicted regions  and used to test the presence and orientation of short transcripts in northern blot analyses. as a positive control, an additional probe was designed that corresponds to the srna characterized by scarlato et al.  <cit> . when total rna extracted from b. pertussis cultures stopped at an ods <dig> nm of  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  was analyzed,  <dig> positions in addition to the positive control showed evidence of transcription . the transcription profile of these  <dig> genomic regions was further analyzed for the kinetics of expression over  <dig> h of culture  . all the bands clearly detected in the northern blots in the validation experiments  and in the phenotypic modulation experiments  were considered as transcripts. each detected transcript was labeled with a capital letter. a number was added after the letter to discriminate transcripts in case of multiple bands . locations for which transcription was detected on both strands were distinguished with an apostrophe, e.g. transcriptm, transcriptm' .

the analysis of five genomic positions resulted in the detection of  <dig> bands , indicating the presence of two overlapping transcripts of different lengths, as has been seen for several srnas of pseudomonas aeroginosa <cit>  and for escherichia coli istr <dig> and istr <dig>  which have each a specific function and are generated from separate promoters but share a common 5' end  <cit> . alternatively, these bands could be the result of a post-transcriptional processing of a single rna transcript  <cit> .

some transcripts were only produced during the exponential phase . transcript d <dig> was expressed at higher levels during exponential phase compared to the early and stationary phases, whereas transcript d <dig> did not show any significant modification of expression during growth. this observation rules out the possibility that transcript d <dig> is the precursor of transcript d <dig>  and argues that the two transcripts are independent and under the control of different factors. in contrast, transcripts a <dig>  a <dig> and transcripts f <dig>  f <dig>  are expressed at similar levels during the different growth phases. they may therefore each be produced from a unique rna and subsequently processed into a shorter version. finally, two regions gave rise to a transcript from both strands. transcripts l <dig> and l' are transcribed respectively from the lagging and leading strand template of predicted region 3811548- <dig>  transcripts m and m' are transcribed respectively from the lagging and leading strand template of predicted region 3896371- <dig>  in both cases, the two transcripts had the same apparent size . for these two pairs of transcripts, the biotinylated probes used to detect transcription on both strands were designed approximately at the same coordinates, indicating that the observed transcripts are complimentary to each other for most of their lengths .

most regulatory srnas are synthesized as discrete transcripts under the control of dedicated promoter and terminator sequences. however, some bacterial regulatory elements correspond to sequences at the 5' or 3' utrs of mrnas that can adopt different conformations in response to environmental signals. this is the case for autoregulatory motifs and riboswitches  <cit> . some of these regulatory elements can, under specific conditions, cause transcriptional arrest . in order to test whether some of the transcripts detected in this study are abortive, processed or degraded forms of the 5'utr or 3'utr of their neighboring genes, a control rt-pcr was carried out on transcripts which were in close vicinity of and in the same orientation as their neighboring 5' or 3' orf . all detected transcripts were found to result from independent transcription, except for transcript b, which was linked to the transcription of the downstream gene rpsb , encoding the 30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  the function of s <dig> is still uncertain. it may potentially act as a bridge between the 16s rna and ribosomal protein s <dig>  <cit> . the orf of rpsb genes have recently been shown to be preceded by a conserved specific motif in the 5'utr, which could be a cis-regulatory element binding to the s <dig> protein for an autoregulatory control of its own synthesis  <cit> . the existence of transcript b suggests that in b. pertussis the 5'utr of rpsb contains a cis-regulatory element inhibiting the full-length transcription of the mrna, as it has been demonstrated for other ribosomal protein genes  <cit> .

finally, the coding potential of all transcripts was evaluated by a search for potential coding sequences in their genomic regions using the program 'orf finder' of the ncbi  <cit>  . as the b. pertussis genome appears to be under-annotated when the easygene prediction is compared to the refseq annotation  <cit> , we also looked for predicted coding sequences or neighboring genes with alternative start codons in these genomic regions, using the prokaryotic gene-finder algorithm easygene. no coding sequences were predicted in the transcribed regions, even for the longest ones.

in view of these observations we conclude that all detected transcripts are genuine srnas and were therefore named bordetella pertussis rnas . the rpsb gene probably contains in its 5'utr an autoregulatory element, and bprb most likely results from the inhibition of transcription of the rpsb mrna. the validated srna genes are scattered throughout the b. pertussis chromosome . the location of these srna genes relatively to their neighboring genes was determined by the biotinylated probe coordinates and the apparent sizes on the northern blots .

features of the b. pertussis srnas
specific and general features of the b. pertussis srnas were further analyzed and compared with those of other bacterial srnas. the genes of the b. pertussis srnas are located in igr of various lengths, comprised between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. they have no apparent preference for lagging or leading strand templates, but they are preferentially located on one of the two replichores  . these characteristics are similar to those of the e. coli srna genes  <cit> .

some of the b. pertussis srna genes  are very close to or overlap adjacent orfs in the opposite orientation and thus are likely to act on their mrna, whereas others are more distant from the adjacent orfs and/or in the same orientation . the potential mrna targets of all srnas were predicted using targetrna algorithm  <cit> . the predicted gene targets were compared to documented targets of srnas from other bacteria. however, none of the predicted b. pertussis mrna targets was orthologous to a srna target from another bacterium . similarly, orthologous genes of the b. pertussis srna-flanking genes were searched in the rfam and noncode databases, as some srnas are cis-encoded antisense or cis-acting elements. the only product mentioned in these databases is the ribonuclease e gene , which flanks bpra and is in the same orientation. bpra might therefore be the 5'utr cis-acting element of the ribonuclease e gene , which codes for a key enzyme in the mrna degradation pathway, including its own. this rne 5'utr element acts as a sensor of the cellular rnase e concentration and allows for auto-regulation of its mrna degradation  <cit> .

phenotypic modulation of b. pertussis srnas
to investigate whether some of the new srnas genes may potentially be under the control of the two-component system bvga/s and therefore potentially be involved in bordetella virulence regulation, phenotypic modulation was induced by adding nicotinic acid or mgso <dig> in the growth medium in order to switch the bacteria from the virulent  to the non-virulent phase   <cit> . the modulation of expression was monitored by northern blot analyses for up to  <dig> h after induction  and the expression profiles were compared to those of the non-induced culture. one srna, bprj, showed a change in its expression compared to the control culture. the 80-nucleotides band detected in the non-modulated culture did not change after phenotypic modulation, but a second band of approximately  <dig> nucleotides appeared  <dig> h and  <dig> h after induction of phenotypic modulation by mgso <dig> and nicotinic acid, respectively . this new band is indicative of longer transcript overlapping the 80-nucleotide transcript and appears to be specific for the non-virulent phase . according to the nomenclature adopted above, this second transcript was named bprj <dig> to distinguish it from the 80-nucleotides transcript, which was named bprj <dig> 

to confirm that this new transcript is under the control of the bvga/bvgs system, its expression was monitored by northern blot analysis in the avirulent bplow mutant in which part of the bvga-bvgs operon had been deleted  <cit> . bprj <dig> was also detected in the bplow rna , confirming its vrg  feature. the other vrgs of b. pertussis mainly encode cell-envelope, small-molecule degradation or hypothetical proteins  <cit>  and include the previously described but uncharacterized vrg <dig>  vrg <dig>  vrg <dig> and vrg <dig> genes  <cit> .

identification of a novel betaproteobacteria repeated element
a local dna sequence analysis using yass showed that the bprj <dig> and bprj <dig> genomic region contains a sequence, from coordinates  <dig> to  <dig>  highly repeated in the bordetella  and in several other beta-proteobacteria genomes . we named it therefore beta-proteobacterial repeat element . this repeated element is found as a full-length sequence of ~ <dig> bp or as partial but conserved sequence  with a maximum number of  <dig> repeats  in the genome of polaromonas sp. js <dig> . all identified repeated elements were located in chromosomal dna, usually in igrs, although some overlap orfs at their 5' or 3' ends by a few bases. surprisingly, some of the repeats are located entirely within coding sequences.

some igrs and orfs contain more than one bre  and bb3202) organized in tandem with no or only a few nucleotides between each repeat. the complete and partial bre sequences are scattered around the chromosomes of b. pertussis, b. bronchiseptica, b. parapertussis and b. avium . an analysis of the bordetella bre sequences revealed  <dig> full-length repeats, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length, and  <dig> partial repeat of  <dig> bp. they exhibit an average gc-content of  <dig> % , which is higher than the average gc-content of igr sequences  and slightly higher than the average gc-content of the complete genome sequences . the orientations of the repeats, inferred by the transcriptional orientation of bprj <dig> and bprj <dig>  are not co-orientated with the direction of the replication fork.

the genetic context, i.e. the nature and orientation of the bre flanking genes, is only moderately conserved between b. pertussis, b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis . for instance, only  <dig>  out of the  <dig> loci from b. pertussis, b. bronchiseptica or b. parapertussis show conservation of the genetic context in the  <dig> genomes . none of the genetic contexts is conserved in the b. avium genome .

a'rpts. nbr.' = number of repeats. number of repeated bre elements at the specific locus.

b'std.' = strand. genomic orientation of flanking mrnas. '>' = on positive strand: the strand given in the genbank genome database; '<' = on negative strand: the complementary strand.

for some loci the numbers of tandem repeats vary between the different genomes. for example, locus # <dig> contains  <dig> repeats in b. pertussis ,  <dig> in b. parapertussis  and  <dig> in b. bronchiseptica  . locus # <dig> is conserved only in b. pertussis and b. bronchiseptica. it has  <dig> repeats in b. pertussis  and  <dig> in b. bronchiseptica . two out of  <dig> loci in b. bronchiseptica  have no homologous locus in the other genomes, and  <dig> out of  <dig> loci in the b. parapertussis genome  has no homologous locus in the other genomes. a multiple alignment analysis on the bordetella repeats shows a high level of conservation within the genus, as well as more widely within the all betaproteobacteria class .

several small repeats have been documented over the years in other prokaryotic species, including erics in enterobacteria  <cit> , nemis in neisseria spp.  <cit> , the box and rup elements in streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , mirus in mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit>  and the bcr <dig> element of bacillus cereus <cit> . these repeats often feature characteristics of mobile elements and have a role in mrna stabilization, transcription termination or promoter activity. bre, described for the first time in this study, needs further investigation before we can suggest any potential function. its heterogeneous chromosomal distribution and the fact that it is sometimes found in multiple copies at a same locus might imply a mobility or a past-mobility property. a preliminary search for bre in sequences of other strains of b. pertussis, b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis revealed the presence of variable numbers of the repeat at the same locus among different strains . this qualifies bres as variable number tandem repeats . this feature was verified using a vntr analysis program  <cit> , and most of identified loci were correctly predicted as vntr, except for locus  <dig> in b. pertussis and b. bronchiseptica, and for locus  <dig> in b. bronchiseptica . additional investigations are under progress to assess bre as potential genotyping markers.

CONCLUSIONS
b. pertussis and b. parapertussis, the second agent of whooping cough-like disease, have evolved relatively recently from a b. bronchiseptica-like ancestor, but these species have remained clonal, with a very limited number of b. pertussis-specific genes  <cit> . it is established that b. pertussis evolution and adaptation to humans occurred mainly through gene loss and recombination of the chromosome rather than through acquisition of new genes that would promote human infection  <cit> . it has also been suggested that certain genes are expressed differently in b. pertussis and in b. bronchiseptica, and that this difference might be responsible in part for infection in humans  <cit> . such differences in expression may rely on classical base substitutions or indels in promoter regions of these genes but perhaps also on the specific action of unidentified regulatory molecules, such as srnas. in this study we have shown that b. pertussis, like other pathogens, expresses srnas and that the expression of one of them, bprj <dig>  is under the control of the bvga/bvgs system. this srna and others, identified in this study or yet to be identified, could be important regulators for b. pertussis virulence acting either under the control of bvga/bvgs as co-regulators or as independent virulence regulators.
