BACKGROUND
raffinose synthase  is an important enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the raffinose family oligosaccharides  which are α <dig> -galactosyl extensions of sucrose  occurring frequently in higher plants. the first step in their biosynthesis is initiated by galactinol synthase  which catalyses the formation of galactinol , using udp-galactose  and myo-inositol  as substrates. the second step involves rs which transfers the galactosyl moiety from gol to the c <dig> position of the glucose  moiety in suc, forming an α <dig> -galactosidic linkage to yield the trisaccharide raffinose . in a third step, stachyose synthase  transfers the galactosyl moiety from gol to the c <dig> position of the gal moiety in raf to yield the tetrasaccharide stachyose . biosynthesis of higher rfo oligomers occurs via a gol-independent biosynthetic pathway. in ajuga reptans, galactan:galactan galactosyl transferase  utilizes rfos as both galactosyl donors and acceptors during chain elongation, facilitating the synthesis of higher rfo oligomers 13;  <cit> ). ggt activity has also been reported to occur in leaves of coleus blumei <cit> .

plant rss are generally poorly characterised and putative gene sequences have been reported for only a few plants, including pea, cucumber, maize, grape, rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . to date, the only extensive biochemical characterisation of a rs has been reported from pea seeds  <cit> , cucumber  <cit>  and to a lesser degree from rice  <cit> . arabidopsis is reported to contain six putative abiotic stress-inducible rs genes . however, we have recently demonstrated that rs <dig> , contrary to being reported as an abiotic stress-inducible rs  <cit> , is in fact a bona fide alkaline α-galactosidase . conversely, rs <dig>  is annotated as being similar to the α-gal atsip <dig>  but evidence suggests that it is a rs  <cit> . based on sequence similarity to the known pea rs, rs <dig> has also been suggested to be the only rs isoform in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the absence of complete functional characterisation of the six putative rss, their actual number in arabidopsis is a matter of speculation.

in arabidopsis vegetative tissues , the only rfo to accumulate is raf, occurring exclusively during exposure to a myriad of abiotic stresses  <cit> . in mature arabidopsis seeds, however, both raf and sta accumulate  <cit> . little is known of rs or their contribution to rfo physiology in arabidopsis, despite comprehensive identification and characterisation of the  <dig> gols genes in this plant  <cit> . using a reverse-genetic approach, some indirect evidence points to rs <dig> being a true rs  <cit> . in that study, a single t-dna loss-of-function mutant was shown to lack raf in the leaves after  <dig> d of cold treatment at 4°c, suggesting rs <dig> to be involved in cold stress-induced raf accumulation. the gene was neither functionally identified nor were its gene expression, enzyme activity or temporal raf accumulation during the  <dig> d treatment determined. however, in a separate study significant increases and decreases of rs <dig> transcripts were reported to occur in arabidopsis leaves subjected to cold acclimation and deacclimation, respectively  <cit> . high salinity  and abscisic acid  treatments would also appear to result in an increase of rs <dig> transcripts  <cit> . in that study, although transcripts increased under both treatments, raf only accumulated under high salinity and no loss-of-function mutant for rs <dig> was analysed.

in the present work, we further characterised rs <dig> as a bona fide rs by heterologous expression and functional identification in e. coli. we also characterised in vivo rs activity and raf accumulation against two additional t-dna loss-of-function mutants  following  cold-stress ,  water deficit,  high salinity ,  methyl viologen -induced oxidative stress , and  heat shock . surprisingly, the rs activity of rs <dig> encompassed all of these different abiotic stresses with both mutants showing no rs activity and failing to accumulate any raf in the leaves. our findings firmly place rs <dig>  as the only rs in arabidopsis leaves orchestrating abiotic stress-induced raf accumulation.

RESULTS
crude extracts from e. coli heterologously expressing rs <dig> produce raf
the rs <dig> cdna was cloned into the pproex htc vector and heterologously expressed in e. coli . when incubated with 50 mm suc and 5 mm gol at ph  <dig> , crude extracts from e. coli cultures induced for recombinant protein expression with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  were clearly able to synthesise a compound which eluted at the same retention time as a commercial raf standard . this was contrary to crude extracts from e. coli cultures transformed with the pproex htc vector . the identity of the putative raf produced by the recombinant rs <dig>  was confirmed by collecting the corresponding fractions after hplc separation and hydrolysing them with an acid α-gal. identical to a commercial raf standard , rafr was hydrolysed to suc and gol in a 1: <dig> mole ratio . crude extracts containing recombinant rs <dig> were also tested for alkaline α-gal activity in the presence of 50 mm raf at ph  <dig> . no such activity was detected , precluding rs <dig> as an alkaline α-gal.

seeds from rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> plants show reduced raf concentrations
water-soluble carbohydrates  were extracted from the seeds of mature wild-type and the rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants, and analysed by hplc-pad . the only rfos present in wild-type seeds were sta  and raf  and raf ]. raf concentrations were reduced by about half in the seeds of both rs <dig> mutants. gol hyper-accumulated almost 3-fold in seeds from the rs <dig> mutants, occurring at concentrations of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg g- <dig> dw, respectively. like the sta concentrations, those of suc were about equal in all seed types .

crude extracts from the leaves of rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants are deficient in rs activity under multiple abiotic stresses
to further characterise rs <dig> loss-of-function, we reproduced the cold stress experiment previously described  <cit> , using the two additional t-dna insertion mutants, rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig>  desalted crude enzyme extracts were incubated with either 5 mm udp-gal and 50 mm ino  or 100 mm suc and 10 mm gol  at ph  <dig> .

while wild-type plants showed a clear transcriptional induction of rs <dig> after 24 h of cold stress at 4°c, the leaves of the rs <dig> mutants were transcript deficient . further, when gols activity was measured under these stress conditions, a clear and comparable increase over the first 12 h of cold stress was measured in the leaves of both wild-type and the rs <dig> mutant plants. thereafter, gols activity remained constant until 24 h of stress and declined steadily at  <dig> d and  <dig> d of stress . rs activity in the leaves of wild-type plants increased linearly over the stress period from about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nkat g- <dig> dw after  <dig> d of stress at 4°c. conversely, the leaves of both rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> plants showed only trace activities  which remained unchanged over the duration of the stress .

under a battery of abiotic stresses, including water deficit, high salinity , mv-induced oxidative stress, and heat shock , rs activity in the leaves of wild-type plants increased . conversely, either trace activities or no rs activity was detected in the leaves of the rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants under the same stress conditions.

hplc-pad analyses of total leaf wscs from col- <dig> and rs <dig> mutant plants demonstrated that raf accumulated in col- <dig> leaves under conditions of cold stress, water deficit, high salinity, mv-induced oxidative stress and heat shock. this raf increase was variable, ranging from a 9-fold increase  to a 121-fold increase . conversely, the leaves of rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants were completely deficient of raf under the same stress conditions .

discussion
rs <dig> is not the only rs gene in arabidopsis
recent reports provide conflicting evidence suggesting the existence of either a single  or six  rs isoform/s occurring in arabidopsis. we have recently discounted rs <dig>  as a rs, based on functional expression of the cdna  <cit> . in that study, we demonstrated that atsip <dig>  when expressed in sf <dig> insect cells, lacked any rs activity, but rather showed a distinct hydrolase activity with a preference for raf as a substrate, identifying atsip <dig> as a genuine alkaline α-gal. by heterologously expressing the rs <dig> cdna in e. coli we could demonstrate, in vitro, that crude extracts containing recombinant rs <dig> synthesised raf and presented no α-gal activity , confirming that rs <dig> encodes for a genuine rs.

we hypothesised that if rs <dig> was the sole arabidopsis rs as previously suggested  <cit>  then mature seeds from the rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants would show complete ablation of raf  accumulation. it is well reported that, apart from suc, mature arabidopsis seeds accumulate substantial quantities of rfos . seeds of both rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants showed reduced raf concentrations to about 50% of seeds from wild-type plants. this still represented concentrations of about  <dig>  mg g- <dig> dw, for rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> seeds . the concentrations of the other major seed wscs, sta and suc, were comparable between the mutants and those of wild-type plants . these observations argue for the existence of at least one other, as yet unidentified, rs in arabidopsis which is responsible for raf accumulation during seed development. importantly, we could allocate an additional physiological role to rs <dig> in raf accumulation during seed development, apart from its already reported role in raf accumulation in arabidopsis leaves during cold stress  <cit> .

rs <dig> is the only rs gene responsible for raf accumulation in leaves during abiotic stress
to further investigate the existence of other putative rs genes in vivo, 5-week old soil-grown wild-type and mutant plants were subjected to a battery of abiotic stresses . all of these stress conditions result in the accumulation of raf in the leaves of arabidopsis and have been shown to differentially up-regulate various gols isoforms in leaves  <cit> . surprisingly, while wild-type plants accumulated raf in the leaves under all conditions tested, both rs <dig> mutants failed to do so in their leaves  suggesting that at5g <dig> is the only rs, in leaves, responsible for abiotic stress-induced raf accumulation.

further evidence was obtained by measuring the total extractable rs activity in the leaves of wild-type and rs <dig> mutant plants during exposure to the stresses stated above. under all conditions, an increase in rs activity was measured in leaves of stressed wild-type plants, while leaves of rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants presented either trace  or no measurable rs activities . during our experimentation, we observed distinct variations in rs activity between independent wild-type control plants  despite the controlled growth conditions described. the reason for this finding is unclear, but we propose that it may be due to subtle physiological differences between the plants used in these independent experiments.

the ablation of stress-induced rs activity in the rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutants is astonishing, particularly given that six of the  <dig> gols genes in arabidopsis have been implicated in abiotic stress-related rfo metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, six putative abiotic stress inducible rs genes have recently been reported in arabidopsis . in the present study using a reverse genetic approach, we describe rs <dig>  as being the sole abiotic stress-induced rs in arabidopsis leaves. hence, the putative rs- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  may be precluded as abiotic stress-inducible rss.

as a consequence of rs <dig> loss-of-function, the leaves of rs 5– <dig> and 5– <dig> mutant plants subjected to abiotic stresses hyper-accumulated gol but not raf. the gabi-kat t-dna insertion mutant previously reported also hyper-accumulated gol in the leaves after cold stress . the role of gol as a legitimate stress protectant has been largely overlooked, perhaps because the occurrence of gol is always linked to the presence of raf . our findings clearly demonstrate that rs <dig> loss-of-function mutants provide a raf-free biological system during exposure to abiotic stress, potentially providing a means to analyse a functional role for gol in stress protection. experiments are currently underway with a particular focus on dissecting the possible protective effects that gol hyper-accumulation may facilitate in the absence of raf.

CONCLUSIONS
using a reverse genetic approach rs <dig>  has previously only been characterised as a low temperature-induced rs contributing to raf accumulation in arabidopsis leaves. using two additional loss-of-function mutants we could demonstrate further that rs <dig>  is the sole rs responsible for raf accumulation in arabidopsis leaves exposed to water deficit, high salinity, mv-induced oxidative stress and heat shock and,  also functions in raf accumulation in arabidopsis seeds. collectively, this work unambiguously demonstrates rs <dig> is the only rs responsible for raf accumulation in arabidopsis leaves during abiotic stress and precludes the existence of five other putative abiotic stress-inducible rss recently described on the basis of sequence homology.
