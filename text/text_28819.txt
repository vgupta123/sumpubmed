BACKGROUND
salt stress is one of the major environmental threats that negatively affect plant growth and development. approximately 20% of agricultural land and 50% of cropland worldwide are subjected to salt exposure  <cit> . irrigation water containing trace amounts of sodium chloride  and seawater is main source of salt in soil  <cit> . increasing soil salinity lowers the ability of plant to take up water, and excess ions like na+ and cl− absorbed by roots are harmful to growth of plant by injuring metabolic processes and decreasing photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> . high salinity also imposes secondary stresses like nutritional imbalance and oxidative stress that result in cell damage, yield decrease and growth inhibition. to address these challenges, genetically engineering plants to enhance salt tolerance will be a promising approach. therefore, deciphering the physiological processes and molecular genetic mechanism related to salt-stress resistance will certainly facilitate the understanding of complex biological responses of plants against high salinity, and help in genetically engineering of stress-resistant plants.

micrornas  are a series of endogenous small non-coding rna molecules, which negatively regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by modulating both mrna degradation and translational suppression based on sequence complementarity with their target  <cit> . in plants, a long primary transcript known as mirna primary precursor  is transcribed from a nuclear-encoded mirna gene. then, a mirna:mirna* duplex is released from the fold-back stem loop of mirna precursor obtained from pri-mirna by two cuts under the guide of dicer-like  <dig>  assisted by the dsrna binding protein hyl <dig>  <cit> . finally, the mature mirna is methylated by hen <dig>  <cit> , and then bound with the argonaute protein  <dig>  to form a functional special structure named rna-induced silencing complex , which targets specific mrnas and suppresses their expression by cleavage. aside from the roles in modulating a wide range of essential biochemical, molecular and physiological processes, many studies reported that mirnas were involved in plant responses to a variety of abiotic stresses such as salt  <cit> , drought  <cit> , heat  <cit> , cold  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> .

understanding the mirna-mediated regulatory network of salt stress response will lay the foundation for unraveling the complex molecular genetic mechanism of salt-stress tolerance. a growing body of evidences suggested that mirna-guided gene regulation could play a vital role in plant response to salt stress. using microarray approach, several mirnas such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were found to be differentially expressed after salt shock in arabidopsis  <cit>  and zea mays  <cit> . recently, the extensive application of next generation sequencing  technology has provided unparalleled opportunities to obtain comprehensive sequencing data for the detection of salt-responsive mirnas in various plant species. using this approach, dong et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in salt-stressed functional soybean nodules. under salt stress, seven downregulated conserved mirna families and two upregulated mirna families were isolated in populus tomentosa  <cit> . also in populus euphratica,  <dig> mirnas showed expression alterations during salt stress  <cit> . in salt-stressed caragana intermedia, the expression of seven mirnas including cin-mir157a, cin-mir159a, cin-mir165a, cin-mir167b, cin-mir172b, cin-mir390a and cin-mir396a were induced, while cin-mir398a was repressed  <cit> . additionally, many salt-responsive mirnas were also been identified in some vegetable crops. for instance, in soybeans,  <dig> mirnas were detected to be differentially expressed under salt treatment  <cit> . differentially expressed mirnas including  <dig> downregulated and three upregulated ones were identified after salt stress in solanum linnaeanum using ngs technology  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> mirnas were identified to be differentially regulated by abiotic stresses  in celery  <cit> . totally,  <dig> known and  <dig> candidate mirnas were differentially expressed under salt condition in broccoli  <cit> . taken together, these findings implied that mirna-mediated gene regulatory pathways could play significant roles in plant adaptive response towards salt stress.

radish , belonging to the brassicaceae family, is a globally important root vegetable crop especially in asia  <cit> . using solexa-sequencing technology, xu et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas from radish roots. more recently, some conserved and novel mirnas associated with cadmium stress response, embryogenesis and lead stress response were also identified in radish  <cit> . salt stress is a limiting factor for radish that adversely influences germination, fresh weight, health-promoting compounds and antioxidant activity  <cit> . therefore, exploring the regulatory mechanism responsive to salt stress will be of important significance for engineering of salt-tolerant radish germplasm. however, no investigation on identification of mirnas and their target genes responsive to salt stress in radish has been reported to date. in this study, two small rna  libraries from the control  and salt-treated  radish roots were constructed and sequenced using ngs technology. the aims were to detect salt-responsive mirnas from radish roots, explore their roles in plant response to salt stress by predicting their target transcripts, and reveal the mirna-mediated regulatory network of salt stress response in radish. the obtained results of this study could provide valuable information for further validating the regulatory roles of salt-responsive mirnas in radish, and facilitate dissection of molecular mechanism underlying plant adaptive response to salt stress in radish and other root vegetable crops.

RESULTS
overview of transcriptome and srna sequencing in radish
to establish an overall reference sequence database, a cdna library constructed from radish roots was sequenced, totally  <dig>  m raw reads were generated and  <dig>  contigs were obtained . these mrna transcriptome sequences, together with the available gss  and est  sequences released in ncbi database, formed the radish reference genome for identification of known and novel mirnas in radish, as well as the prediction of mirna corresponding target genes.

radish seedlings under salt treatment exhibited some negatively morphological changes including chlorisis and withering of leaves, and slight inhibition of plant growth. in this study,  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m raw reads were generated from ck and na <dig> libraries, respectively . after filtering out adapter contamination and low-quality tags,  <dig>  m  and  <dig>  m  clean reads were acquired from ck and na <dig> libraries, respectively . among them,  <dig> , <dig>  were ck library-specific with  <dig> , <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig> , <dig>  were only derived from na <dig> library with  <dig> , <dig>  unique srnas, and  <dig> , <dig>  were shared in both with  <dig>   unique sequences .table  <dig>

identification of known mirnas in radish
a total of  <dig> unique sequences belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> unique sequences representing  <dig> non-conserved mirna families were identified in both libraries . the diversity of radish mirna families could be determined from their number of members . as shown, most of the conserved mirna families had members of no less than two. of these, the mir156/ <dig> and mir165/ <dig> families were the largest ones with  <dig> members, followed by mir <dig> and mir <dig> with nine members. however, some conserved mirna families including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  had only one member. moreover, most of the non-conserved mirna families contained only one member.table  <dig>

the number of mirna reads in two libraries was highly variable with a ratio  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , and was exploited as the indicator for assessing mirna expression level . mir <dig> presented the highest expression abundance with  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> copies in ck and na <dig> libraries, respectively. several conserved mirna families including mir156/ <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> also exhibited extraordinarily high abundance in both libraries, while some other mirna families  were moderately expressed with a total reads ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  however, several mirna families including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were detected to be expressed at an extremely low level in both libraries. furthermore, a significant distinction in expression abundance was also observed among different members in a certain mirna family . for example, in the mir156/ <dig> family, the read number of mir157a was  <dig> , while mir156h had only  <dig> copies. this vast expression span among different members within a family suggested the precise expression of mirnas under certain conditions.figure  <dig>

identification of novel mirna candidates
in the present study, based on the recent annotated criteria of novel mirnas  <cit> ,  <dig> srna unique sequences belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified as putative novel mirnas. of these, seven novel mirnas were detected to have mirna*s , and many mirna*s were sequenced only once , which might be partially attributed to that most of the mirna*s had been degraded in mirna pathway  <cit> . among these novel mirnas, most of them were ck-specific or na200-specific, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in addition, the novel mature mirnas displayed a main length distribution ranging from 21 nt to 24 nt, and 21 nt mirnas accounted for the highest proportion . regarding their expression abundance, only  <dig> novel mirnas  had been sequenced more than  <dig> copies in each srna library. moreover, the precursors of  <dig> potential novel mirnas were also predicted, with minimum free energy  values ranging from − <dig>  to − <dig>  kcal/mol and an average length of 148 nt .table  <dig>

identification of salt-responsive mirnas in radish
to identify the differentially expressed mirnas under salt stress, the analysis of differential expression patterns was performed by statistical comparison between two libraries. in total,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified to be differentially regulated under salt stress , and their expression alterations were showed in figure  <dig>  among them,  <dig> mirnas  were upregulated, and  <dig> mirnas  were repressed by salt stress. of these,  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> known and seven novel mirnas were markedly differentially expressed with an absolute value of log <dig> ratio  >  <dig>  in addition, many of these salt-responsive mirnas, such as mir160b/d-3p, mir166g/h-3p, mir535b and rsa-mir <dig>  were confined to be expressed in ck or na <dig> library, suggesting that these mirnas might be thoroughly induced or repressed by salt stress. further analysis also indicated that different members in a certain mirna family might have similar or disparate expression patterns after salt exposure. for example, mir172a and mir172e-3p were significantly upregulated, whereas mir172c was downregulated, providing further evidence on the complexity of mirna regulatory roles.figure  <dig>

prediction and annotation of target genes for salt-responsive mirnas
predicting the target genes of mirnas would be essential for better understanding of the biological functions for these salt-responsive mirnas. as a result,  <dig> genes were predicted to be targets for  <dig> salt-responsive mirnas . all target sequences were successfully classified into three go  ontologies using blast2go program, including cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes . as shown, the main terms were “cell” , “cell part”  and “organelle”  in the cellular component category. for their molecular functions, the “binding”  and “catalytic activity”  were the most abundant subcategories. the predominant terms implicated in biological processes were “biological regulation” , “cellular progress” , “developmental progress” , “metabolic progress”  and “response to stimulus” .table  <dig>

many of the predicted target genes were homologous to those encoding some stress-related transcription factors , including spb-like proteins , myb domain proteins , auxin response factor  family, apetala <dig> , nac domain-containing proteins , nuclear transcription factor y  and bzip . moreover, several target genes encoding important enzymes or functional proteins playing roles in diverse metabolic pathways, such as argonaute , glutamine synthetase , glutamate decarboxylase  <dig> , argininosuccinate synthase, s-adenosylmethionine -dependent methyltransferase, pentatricopeptide repeats  and histone acetyltransferase , were also identified. by annotation of targets, a few transcripts were found likely to participate in plant abiotic stress responses. for instance, a mir <dig> target was cbl-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  <dig> , which was related to stress signal perception and transduction  <cit> ; mir397a targeted laccases , which were involved in lignification and thickening of the cell wall  <cit> . in general, these results implied that these putative target genes might be implicated in diverse biological processes under salt stress in radish.

rt-qpcr validation
to verify the results of deep sequencing and detect the dynamic expression profiles of salt-responsive mirnas at different stages of salt treatment , the expression of ten salt-responsive mirnas were analyzed with rt-qpcr . as expected, the obtained data suggested that all examined mirnas shared a coincidental expression change between srna sequencing and rt-qpcr. for known mirnas, mir166g-3p had a downregulated expression pattern, except that it slightly increased at 1 h of salt treatment. the expression of downregulated mir169b fell at first then abruptly increased at 12 h, and again gradually decreased to a low level. in contrast to mir169b, mir841b-3p showed an opposite expression trend with increasing treatment time. mir172c was downregulated and maintained at a quite low level at all treatment stages. with the increase of treatment time, the expression of mir397a was initially restricted, but then gradually restored to the initial level. for the novel mirnas, rsa-mir <dig> expression increased until 24 h of salt treatment. rsa-mir <dig> and rsa-mir <dig> shared a similar expression pattern, but they reached their maxima at 3 h and 6 h, respectively. rsa-mir12a was downregulated at nearly all treatment stages, except that it abruptly elevated at 24 h. the level of rsa-mir <dig> gradually increased to its maximum at 12 h, and then dramatically restored to the initial level.figure  <dig>

furthermore, the expression patterns of five corresponding target genes, namely sam-dependent methyltransferase gene , nf-ya <dig> , snz , rhf2a  and thioesterase gene , were also examined to confirm the dynamic correlation between the mirnas and their target genes under salt stress. the results revealed an approximately negative correlation between the expression of mirnas and their corresponding targets . for instance, the salt-stressed downregulation of mir166g-3p and mir172c led to upregulation of sam-dependent methyltransferase gene and snz, respectively. however, the expression of rhf2a was found to be restrained by upregulated rsa-mir <dig> in the early stage of salt exposure.figure  <dig>

discussions
as one of the most serious abiotic stresses worldwide, salt stress poses an increasingly severe threat to plant growth and development. in plants, to cope with salt stress, the modulation of numerous stress-responsive genes at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels is activated. micrornas are well known as ubiquitous regulators of gene expression and play vital roles in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . in recent years, increasing reports have demonstrated that mirna-guided gene regulation plays a significant role in salt stress response in various plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , p. tomentosa  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and s. linnaeanum  <cit> . radish is an important root vegetable crop worldwide. although several studies of mirnas associated with some important horticulture traits have been conducted in radish  <cit> , no study on identification of salt-responsive mirnas and their target genes has been reported to date.

srna sequencing and identification of known mirnas in radish
in the present study, a total of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m unique srna sequences were obtained from ck and na <dig> libraries, respectively, suggesting adequate sequencing depth for further analysis. 21 nt srnas might play more prevailing roles in salt stress response due to their most abundant expression in both libraries , which was consistent with previous studies in several tree and vine species including populus  <cit> , trifoliate orange  <cit> , and grapevine  <cit> . in addition, a striking divergence also existed in expression patterns among diverse types of srnas, which showed that the levels of 21 nt and 22 nt srnas were markedly decreased under salt stress, whereas those of 20 nt, 23 nt and 24 nt srnas were significantly increased . due to the identified srnas with different sizes represented diverse functions in regulating gene expression, a more extensive modulation of gene expression by srnas might exist during response to salt stress.

the diversity of radish mirna families could be determined by the abundance and number of members. in this study, conserved mirna families had relatively higher expression and number of family members when compared with non-conserved ones , which was in agreement with previous findings in radish  <cit> . moreover, it was also inferred that the read number of mirnas varied from one to millions of copies reflected their diverse expression levels in radish. for example, mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> had extraordinarily high number of reads, suggesting these mirnas might be expressed at a higher level, whereas mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed low abundance with less than  <dig> reads, therefore, possibly were expressed at a lower level.

characterization of salt-responsive mirnas in radish
a number of mirnas were regulated by salt stress in diverse plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , z. mays  <cit>  and s. linnaeanum  <cit> . in arabidopsis, several upregulated mirnas  and downregulated mir <dig> were detected under salt stress using the mirna-microarray technology  <cit> . by the same method, ding et al.  <cit>  also reported that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were downregulated, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were upregulated in salt-stressed z. mays. moreover, by ngs technology,  <dig> downregulated mirnas  and three upregulated mirnas  were identified in s. linnaeanum under nacl exposure  <cit> . many mirnas were evolutionarily conserved across different plant species, which indicated that the conserved regulation of mirnas played a vital role in plant response to salt stress. in the present study,  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were differentially expressed and considered as salt-responsive mirnas . however, several salt-responsive mirna families including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  did not show significant alterations of expression in the presence of salt stress in radish, although some of them were detected to be significantly altered by salt stress in other plant species  <cit> . this discrepancy suggested that these mirnas potentially expressed in a species-specific manner under salt stress.

additionally, it was worth noting that some salt-responsive mirnas identified in this study might be fine-tuned across distinct biotic and abiotic stresses. for instance, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were widely reported to play important roles in aba, drought and salt stress responses  <cit> , and mir <dig> was considered as a bridge linking plant responses to oxidative stress and other stresses such as water deficit, salt stress, aba stress, uv stress, nutrient deficiency and bacterial infection  <cit> . this observation was likely to be attributed to the shared regulatory genes modulated by these stress-related mirnas across diverse stress responses, indicating that the inferred cross-regulation of mirnas might link plant responses to various stresses  <cit> . however, further efforts are still needed to precisely confirm the roles of these salt-responsive mirnas and explore the regulatory mechanism underlying these functions in plant adaptive response to salt stress.

mirna-mediated regulatory network of salt stress response in radish
micrornas function in gene modulation by regulating specific mrna transcripts for degradation in plants. recently, the ngs technology coupled with bioinformatics analysis have been widely applied to identify mirnas and their corresponding target genes responsive to salt stress in plants  <cit> . in this study, a number of mirnas were identified to be salt-responsive in radish, and many of them might play crucial roles in regulatory network of salt stress response by regulating specific stress-related genes. on basis of these results, a putative model of mirna-target interactions involved in plant response to salt stress was put forward here, which presented the proposed regulation cascades after salt exposure in radish root cells .figure  <dig> 
the proposed model of mirna-mediated regulatory network associated with salt stress response in radish. the potential interactions between salt-responsive mirnas and their corresponding target genes were shown.



in the present study, target prediction for  <dig> salt-responsive mirnas revealed that many targets were tf genes including spls, mybs, arfs, ap <dig>  nacs and nf-y , which were reported to function in activating stress-responsive genes  <cit> . many target genes might play important roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. for example, mir169-targeted nuclear factor y subunit a , which conditioned whole plant growth through modifying carbohydrate metabolism and cell elongation, was widely regulated under drought and salt stress  <cit> . moreover, a set of evidences also supported the involvement of mir <dig> in stress responses, regulating the mirna-mediated cleavage of nac. nacs were widely modulated by various abiotic stresses like salinity, cold, aba or drought  <cit> , and also integrated responses to environmental stimuli into regulation of plant development processes  <cit> .

additionally, different members of auxin response factors  family , which were reported to participate in auxin signaling pathways and be negative regulators of growth and development  <cit> , were also identified for salt-responsive mir160b in radish. similar findings of mir160-mediated arf regulation were also reported in salt-stressed p. tomentosa  <cit> , drought-stressed p. persica  <cit>  and cold-stressed trifoliate orange  <cit> . these observations implied mir160-regulated arfs might play an important role in plant responses to various abiotic stresses by fine-tuning plant growth and development under stress conditions. other genes including mir156/157-targeted spls  and mir172-targeted ap <dig>  which were involved in regulating plant growth and development, were also identified in this study. it was reported that mir156-regulated spls and mir172-targeted ap <dig> conjointly conditioned the transitions among different developmental stages including embryogenesis, vegetative and reproductive growth, and participated in determining floral organ identity  <cit> . similar to spls and ap <dig>  mir159-regulated mybs  were also considered to modulate plant growth and development especially flowering under salt stress. it was reported that overexpressed mir <dig> resulted in a delayed flowering state concomitant with a repression of its target gene, gamyb in gloxinia  <cit> . given that plant growth and development including bolting and flowering were usually adversely-influenced under stress conditions, it might indicate the involvement of these mirna-target transcripts in the network of genes regulated by salt-responsive mirnas in radish .

apart from key tfs, a number of genes which encode important enzymes or functional proteins, such as apx <dig>  csd <dig>  apss , lacs , ubcs , ca2+-mediated signal-related proteins , were also considered to play important roles in salt stress response. among them, cipk <dig>  cam <dig> and cdpk <dig>  were reported to cooperatively perform their functions to initiate the stimulus-specific downstream signal transduction  <cit> . mir397-targeted lacs encoding laccases were related to lignification and thickening of the cell wall in secondary cell growth  <cit> , and accordingly enhanced the ability to alleviate stress damage. furthermore, several target genes were found to be cross-regulated by mirnas in response to salt stress and other abiotic stresses including oxidative stress and nutrient stress. as represented in this study, mir398b-3p targeted csd <dig> encoding superoxide dismutase , which was reported to participate in scavenging excess reactive oxygen species  in plants exposed to salt stress  <cit> . additionally, l-ascorbate peroxidase encoded by mir396-regulated apx <dig> was also a significant ros scavenging enzyme, which was involved in regulation of intracellular ros expression levels  <cit> . several similar mirna-targets had also been identified in plants exposed to nutrient deficiency. for instance, mir <dig> was widely reported to participate in catalyzing inorganic sulfate assimilation by suppressing the expression of atp sulfurylases   <cit> , and mir398-mediated csd <dig> regulation was responsible for maintaining copper concentration in plant cells  <cit> . moreover, mir <dig> was also found to regulate phosphorus homeostasis by modulating the expression of ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme   <cit> . on account of the fact that prolonged salt stress could usually lead to some secondary stresses such as oxidative stress and nutrition disorder  <cit> , the results indicated that these mirna-regulated target genes might play significant roles in plant adaptive response to salt stress, as an indispensable part of regulatory network responsive to salt stress in radish .

CONCLUSIONS
the application of srna sequencing technology combined with bioinformatics analysis provides an unprecedented opportunity to obtain comprehensive understanding of novel and salt-responsive mirnas in radish. a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> potential novel mirnas were differentially expressed under salt stress. prediction and analysis of target genes for these salt-responsive mirnas demonstrated that numerous transcription and regulatory factors  primarily functioned in a variety of biological pathways under stress conditions, including stress-related signal sensing and transduction, regulation of ion homeostasis, basic metabolic processes, secondary stress responses, as well as modulation of attenuated plant growth and development. given that plant responses to abiotic stresses consist of many complex biochemical processes in which different components operate together, this investigation could advance our insights into the mirna-mediated regulatory network of salt stress response, and the results will facilitate further dissection of molecular mechanism underlying plant response to salt stress in radish and other root vegetable crops.
