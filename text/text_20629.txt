BACKGROUND
insect blood cells  play a central role in mediating innate immune responses  <cit> . hemocytes participate in defense against invading microorganisms either directly through cellular mechanisms like phagocytosis or indirectly through secretion of soluble humoral factors such as antimicrobial peptides, complement-like proteins and components of the proteolytic cascade that regulates melanization  <cit> .

much of our knowledge of insect hemocytes derives from studies with the model insect drosophila melanogaster and lepidoptera  <cit> , but increasing evidence also implicates hemocytes as being essential to the immune response of mosquitoes including anopheles gambiae that vectors human malaria  <cit> . in adult mosquitoes, hemocytes mediate phagocytic and/or melanotic immune responses  <cit> , and express several immunity-related molecules implicated in defense against bacteria and/or malaria parasites  <cit> . as a first step in the functional genomic analysis of mosquito hemocytes, we conducted a genome-wide microarray-based transcriptomic profiling of anopheles gambiae hemocytes in response to infection by bacteria and plasmodium berghei. we placed particular emphasis on genes with putative functions in the mosquito's immune system.

RESULTS
the hemocyte transcriptome
we used our previously published "high injection/recovery" method to isolate hemocyte samples with little or no contamination by other cell types from adult female mosquitoes  <cit> . this approach results in recovery of the three types of hemocytes- granulocytes, oenocytoids and prohemocytes – produced by an. gambiae that are distinguished from one another by a combination of morphological, functional, and molecular characters  <cit> .

we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of hemocytes using custom-made 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays representing the approximately  <dig>  genes of the predictedtranscriptome of an. gambiae  <cit> .

in order to identify hemocyte-specific and immune-responsive transcripts, we first compared transcripts expressed in hemocytes from one day old sugar-fed mosquitoes to transcripts detected in whole mosquitoes of the same age and feeding status. this resulted in identification of the hemocyte-enriched transcriptome. we then compared hemocytes from  <dig> day old mosquitoes,  <dig> hour after immune challenge with heat-killed escherichia coli or micrococcus luteus, to control female mosquitoes injected with sterile pbs to determine the bacteria challenge responsive transcriptomes. we used heat-killed bacteria in these assays, because our primary interest was in identifying the bacterial responsive transcriptome and to avoid the potentially confounding effects of altered gene expression due to the lethal effects of a systemic infection associated with injection of living bacteria. lastly, we compared hemocytes from mosquitoes at  <dig> hours and  <dig> days after ingestion of a blood meal infected with plasmodium berghei to mosquitoes of the same age fed a non-infected blood meal to determine the ookinete and sporozoite infection responsive transcriptomes, respectively. this design resulted in a total of five experimental treatments.

overall, we detected a total of  <dig> genes expressed in hemocytes expressed in at least one of the experimental treatments . only  <dig>  transcripts were detected in all experimental treatments, but  <dig>  transcripts were identified in at least two of the treatments performed. we observed some variability in detectable transcript levels between the different experimental treatments that most likely reflected differences in age, infection state or other physiological factors  .

comparing gene expression between hemocytes and whole adult female mosquitoes, we identified  <dig> gene transcripts with at least a  <dig> – fold higher presence and  <dig> genes with a lower abundance in hemocytes compared to whole adult female mosquitoes . only  <dig> % of the hemocyte enriched transcripts had predicted functions and these are discussed in additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig> 

hemocyte immune gene expression
we identified expression of  <dig>  of the  <dig> predicted immunity-related genes in at least one of our five experimental comparisons, reinforcing the major role of hemocytes in immune defense  <cit> . importantly and consistent with previous studies, we detected transcription of all  <dig> immunity-related genes previously reported to be expressed in an. gambiae hemocytes. these genes are presented in the additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig>  contrary to expectation, however, only  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts with higher abundance in hemocytes versus whole mosquitoes and  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts with lower abundance were immunity-related genes. these genes are presented in detail in the additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig> 

among the pattern recognition receptors expressed in hemocytes, fbns, pgrps, tep and toll family members were especially well represented. in contrast, relatively fewer c-type lectins , galectins, gram-negative binding proteins  and cd36-like scavenger receptors  were transcribed in hemocytes. seventeen members of the leucine rich repeat  family were transcribed in hemocytes, including two of the three previously reported to mediate anti-plasmodium immune responses   <cit> . we also detected transcription of several members of the recently characterized nimrod superfamily, including putative homologues of eater and nimc- <dig>  <cit>  that are expressed in hemocytes from drosophila melanogaser and that are involved in phagocytosis of bacteria and apoptotic cells  <cit> . as many as  <dig> clip-domain serine proteases,  <dig> of their associated serpin inhibitors  <cit> , and  <dig> putative target ppo zymogens were also expressed in hemocytes  <cit> . all of these factors have been predicted or are experimentally implicated in melanization reactions that occur in response to infection by bacteria and plasmodium  <cit> . thirty-four other genes predicted to encode serine proteases were also transcribed in hemocytes, of which  <dig> were enriched in hemocytes and/or exhibited differential expression following microbial exposure.

in addition to canonical immunity-related genes, we detected several gene transcripts in hemocytes belonging to the cytoskeletal/structural functional class that have conserved roles in phagocytosis  <cit> . these genes were dominated by factors involved in the biogenesis and organization/rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, and included  <dig> components of the arp2/ <dig> actin-nucleation complex;  <dig> vesicle trafficking adp-ribosylation factors ; cofilin; various members of the rho, rac and rab families of small gtpases ; and several wasp family members   <cit> .

comparison of our microarray expression data to est data from bacteria-challenged hemocytes of the mosquitoes aedes aegypti and armigeres subalbatus  <cit>  revealed a relatively high degree of conservation in gene transcripts associated with pathogen recognition and humoral immune responses. conservation of hemocyte-specific transcript expression between the three mosquito species was particularly high for the following groups of immunity-related genes: antimicrobial peptides ; prrs ; clip-domain serine proteases and their serpin inhibitors ; melanization ; antioxidant-related ; and apoptosis-related . in contrast, there was lower concordance between the three mosquito species in gene transcripts associated with functions related to the cytoskeleton , signal transduction  and stress responses . we also compared our microarray expression data to transcriptional profiles for hemocytes from larval stage d. melanogaster  <cit> . this analysis suggested relatively weak conservation in hemocyte gene expression  which may reflect differences in hemocytes from different developmental stages  and the apparent absence in mosquitoes of orthologs for many hemocyte-specific drosophila genes .

hemocyte abundance in response to immune challenge
as previously noted, an. gambiae produces three hemocyte types with granulocytes accounting for greater than 90% of the total number of cells in circulation during the larval, pupal and adult stage  <cit> . in adults, however, the total number of hemocytes in circulation declines with mosquito age while blood feeding stimulates a transient increase in circulating hemocytes  <cit> . we reasoned that infection could also affect hemocyte abundance, which together with age or blood feeding could create variation in microarray expression ratios unrelated to differential gene regulation per se between control and microbe-exposed mosquitoes. to facilitate interpretation of our transcriptome data, therefore, we assessed the effects of microbial challenge on hemocyte abundance in an. gambiae relative to non-infected controls. sample analysis  <dig> h post-infection revealed no significant differences in the total number of hemocytes in circulation  or in the number of granulocytes  and prohemocytes  between mosquitoes injected with e. coli, m. luteus or pbs  . however, injection of m. luteus did induce a significant increase in the number of oenocytoids  ; an alteration that resulted in this hemocyte type comprising 12% of the total number of cells in circulation in m. luteus-challenged mosquitoes compared to 7% and 5% for e. coli-infected mosquitoes and pbs controls.

we infected mosquitoes with p. berghei by blood feeding  <dig> day old mosquitoes and then collecting samples  <dig> h or  <dig> days later. at the  <dig> h time point, parasites were in the ookinete stage in the midgut epithelium of the mosquito while at day  <dig> parasites were in the sporozoite stage and were detected in the salivary glands. controls consisted of hemocytes collected from  <dig> day old, non-blood fed mosquitoes, and hemocytes collected  <dig> h and  <dig> days after mosquitoes fed on a non-infected bloodmeal. consistent with previous results  <cit> , the total number of hemocytes in circulation significantly differed among treatments  with  <dig> h post-blood fed mosquitoes having more hemocytes in circulation than day  <dig> non-blood fed mosquitoes or day  <dig> post-blood feeding mosquitoes . however, no significant differences were detected in the total number of hemocytes and hemocyte types in circulation between infected and control mosquitoes at  <dig> h or  <dig> days. taken together, these results indicate that variation in hemocyte abundance likely affects transcript levels among the five experimental treatments we performed. within a given treatment, however, the lack of differences in hemocyte abundance between experimental and control samples indicates that any differences in microarray expression ratios reflect differential gene expression in response to the pathogen.

this finding is important because global transcriptomic profiles revealed a remarkable degree of specificity with regard to pathogen and stage of immune challenge. of the  <dig> hemocyte transcripts detected in hemocytes,  <dig>  exhibited differential regulation in at least one of the  <dig> experimental comparisons involving challenge by bacteria or p. berghei . among these differentially expressed transcripts, immunity-related genes were significantly over-represented compared to the genes belonging to other functional classes . while immunity-related genes comprised only  <dig> %  of all genes expressed in hemocytes,  <dig> %  of differentially regulated transcripts belonged to this functional class. in contrast, the replication/transcription/translation functional class was significantly under-represented in the group of differentially expressed genes , presumably indicative of the house-keeping function of many of the genes in this category. the percentage of differentially regulated transcripts was not significantly different from that expected under the assumption of no association between functional class and differential regulation upon challenge for the remaining  <dig> functional classes of genes .

further insight into the role of different functional classes of genes was provided by calculating the percentage of differentially expressed transcripts within each functional class for different microbial exposures . this analysis highlighted variation in the overall levels of differential gene transcription among treatments and pathogen-specific functional class responses. for example, in hemocytes from mosquitoes challenged with e. coli, the cytoskeletal/structural class was significantly over-represented in the group of differentially regulated genes compared to other functional classes , while immunity-related genes were not. this likely reflects an important role for phagocytosis and hemocyte migration in defense against bacteria . in contrast, hemocytes from mosquitoes infected p. berghei exhibited an under-representation of redox and oxidoreductive stress class genes at  <dig> h post-infection  . a relatively high percentage of genes belonging to the proteolysis class were also differentially regulated although this difference was not statistically significant .

transcriptional profile of hemocytes from bacteria-infected an. gambiae
challenge with either heat-killed e. coli or m. luteus resulted in the differential regulation of  <dig> transcripts , while only  <dig> transcripts  exhibited similar regulation upon challenge with both elicitors. challenge with m. luteus regulated  <dig>  times more genes compared to challenge with e. coli:  <dig> genes were differentially regulated by m. luteus, while only  <dig> were regulated by e. coli. the percentage of expressed genes differentially regulated was also much greater for m. luteus than for challenge with e. coli . this difference in gene regulation was primarily due to a lack of transcriptional up-regulation following challenge with e. coli: only  <dig> genes were induced by this bacterial species compared to  <dig> by m. luteus.

in total,  <dig> immunity-related genes exhibited significantly different transcription following bacterial challenge. thirteen and  <dig> immunity-related genes, respectively, were differentially transcribed following challenge with either e. coli or m. luteus . only  <dig>  genes differentially transcribed following bacterial challenge were comparably regulated by e. coli and m. luteus, and these are discussed in a greater detail in the additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig> . m. luteus challenge resulted in the up-regulation of  <dig> genes previously identified during an in vivo screen for factors in an. gambiae associated with phagocytosis: cactus, ced6l, pgrpla, pgrplc and tep <dig>  <cit> . for more details on this expression signature see additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig>  four genes encoding protein products with putative roles in melanization were transcriptionally up-regulated in hemocytes following bacterial challenge, and are discussed in additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig>  a number of other genes belonging to diverse functional classes and previously implicated in phagocytosis  <cit>  were also differentially regulated upon bacterial challenge and most of them showed distinct patterns of transcriptional regulation for the two bacterial species and are discussed in a greater detail in the additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig> 

an. gambiae hemocytes differentially respond to e. coli and m. luteus
previous studies with the mosquitoes anopheles albimanus, aedes aegypti and armigeres subalbatus suggest that e. coli is primarily phagocytosed by hemocytes, while micrococcus spp. are melanized extracellularly within the hemolymph  <cit> . our own results  noted a significant increase in the abundance of oenocytoids, which constitutively express phenoloxidase activity, following infection by m. luteus. prior studies with an. gambiae in contrast indicate that granulocytes are the only hemocytes that phagocytize foreign targets and also inducibly express phenoloxidase activity following immune challenge by bacteria  <cit> . we therefore characterized phagocytosis and melanization toward e. coli or m. luteus in an. gambiae to assess whether: 1) oenocytoids and granulocytes differentially respond to these two bacterial species and 2) whether this response is qualitatively consistent with transcriptomic profiles. phagocytosis assays revealed that significantly more granulocytes phagocitized e. coli than m. luteus  . however, we also noted that a higher proportion of granulocytes with internalized m. luteus contained bacteria that were melanized compared to granulocytes with internalized e. coli  . although oenocytoids cannot phagocytize bacteria, challenge with m. luteus also induced a significantly greater proportion of these hemocytes to melanize than e. coli  . these results indicate that similar to other mosquitoes, m. luteus induces a much stronger melanization response than e. coli in an. gambiae, even though granulocytes phagocytize both species of bacteria. although broadly consistent with the up-regulation of phagocytosis and melanization-related genes following m. luteus challenge, these results also do not explain why so few genes with phagocytic or immune functions are up-regulated by e. coli.

transcriptional profile of hemocytes from plasmodium-infected an. gambiae
during the two major spatial transition stages of infection by plasmodium sp., ookinete invasion of the midgut and sporozoite migration through the hemolymph, the parasite experiences considerable loss of abundance in an. gambiae  <cit>  that is in part attributed to hemocyte-mediated immune responses  <cit> . overall, transcripts of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in hemocytes during malaria parasite infection  . when considered relative to the total number of expressed genes, the magnitude of gene regulation was similar for the two different stages of malaria parasite infection . strikingly, only  <dig>  of the differentially regulated transcripts had similar expression profiles during the two infection stages, while  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in opposite directions. the remaining  <dig>  transcripts were differentially expressed exclusively during one of the two stages of parasite infection. only  <dig>  of the  <dig> putative immune genes were regulated in the same direction while  <dig>  transcripts were regulated in opposite directions at  <dig> hours and  <dig> days after p. berghei infection.

hemocyte transcription during p. berghei ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium
at  <dig> hours after infection with p. berghei,  <dig> genes exhibited differential transcription in hemocytes, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . this included  <dig> immunity-related genes, and  <dig> other genes involved in lipid transport which are of particular interest because of their previously reported effects on malaria parasite infection; the retinoid and fatty-acid binding glycoprotein , which encodes apolipophorins i and ii of the insect lipid transporter  <cit> ; apolipophorin iii  <cit> ; and an apolipoprotein d . rfabg transcription has previously been reported to be induced in the midgut epithelium during p. berghei ookinete invasion, and rnai-mediated silencing of this gene significantly increases malaria parasite infection  <cit> . another immune-responsive apod , which was also expressed in hemocytes, is necessary for antibacterial and defense against at least some species of plasmodium  <cit> .

although transcribed in hemocytes, we did not detect differential transcription of the majority of prrs previously implicated in immune responses against plasmodium sp.: agmdl <dig>  ctl <dig>  ctlma <dig>  lrim <dig>  lrrd <dig> , lrrd <dig> , and tep <dig>  <cit> . this was especially surprising for clt <dig>  lrim <dig> and tep <dig>  which are known to be induced  <dig> hours after p. berghei infection  <cit> . however, transcripts encoding the pprs fbn <dig> and dscam, which have are also implicated in defense against p. berghei and the human malaria parasite p. falciparum  <cit> , were significantly up-regulated .

four members of the imd/rel <dig> pathway were up-regulated , and one member was down-regulated . the imd/rel <dig> pathway has previously been reported to limit p. berghei oocyst infection in an. gambiae  <cit> , although others have been unable to replicate this finding  <cit> . in drosophila, cross-regulation between the imd/relish and jnk signaling pathways is well-established  <cit>  . nine genes encoding factors predicted to belong to the proteolytic cascades regulating melanization were differentially transcribed in hemocytes  <dig> hours after p. berghei infection and included serine proteases and their serpin inhibitors . . four other factors with known or putative roles in melanization defense reactions were differentially transcribed in hemocytes during the period of ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium. lysc <dig> was significantly down-regulated in hemocytes at both  <dig> hours and  <dig> days after p. berghei infection, as well as following challenge with m. luteus. lysc <dig> has previously been reported to be induced by bacterial challenge  <cit> , and to inhibit melanization of sephadex beads through interfering with po activity  <cit> . three enzymes implicated in melanogenesis were transcriptionally up-regulated, including: phenylalanine hydroxylase , tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase  and dopamine n-acetyltransferase .  <cit> . the expression of to in hemocytes, and its significant differential expression during both ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium and following challenge with m. luteus suggest a role for to in melanotic defense reactions. dat has not previously been implicated in insect melanization reactions, but its substrate dopamine is an intermediate in melanin production suggesting a potential role in the biochemical pathways mediating melanization.

hemocyte transcription during p. berghei sporozoite migration through the hemolymph
at  <dig> days after p. berghei infection,  <dig> genes were differentially transcribed in hemocytes, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . this included  <dig> immunity-related genes of which  <dig> were repressed and  <dig> were induced. notably,  <dig>  of the immunity-related genes differentially regulated during sporozoite migration through the hemolymph belonged to the fbn family of immunolectins:  <dig> fbns were down-regulated, while  <dig> uncharacterized fbns were up-regulated. the role of fbns in anti-sporozoite defense has not been investigated, but the discrete patterns of fbn expression observed at  <dig> hours and  <dig> days after p. berghei infection suggests that distinct fbn subsets are involved in mosquito immune responses to ookinetes and sporozoites. the remaining  <dig> immunity-related genes transcriptionally up-regulated during the period of sporozoite presence in the hemolymph were: the putative md-2-like lipid-receptor agmdl <dig>  tep <dig>  the an. gambiae ortholog of the drosophila scavenger receptor croquemort , the clip-domain serine proteases clipb <dig> and clipb <dig>  the serpins srpn <dig> and srpn <dig>  and a thioredoxin peroxidase . the role of these factors in infection by plasmodium sp. has not been investigated, except for clipb <dig> which has been shown to promote melanization of ookinetes during invasion of the midgut epithelium and foreign bodies such as sephadex beads inoculated into the thorax  <cit> . clipb <dig>  clipb <dig>  srpn <dig> and clipa <dig>  are all specifically regulated by sporozoite infection and it is tempting to speculate that are part of a common mechanism.

the  <dig> immunity-related genes exhibiting significant down-regulation during sporozoite migration through the hemolymph included  <dig> pattern recognition receptors:  <dig> antimicrobial effectors, and four prophenoloxidases . the down-regulation of ppos associated with sporozoite migration through the hemolymph may represent a host homeostatic mechanism to prevent "toxic shock" following the massive release of these parasite stages into the hemocoel. the remaining immunity-related genes exhibiting significant down-regulation were various and disparate components of the major immunity-related signaling pathways .

other notable genes significantly up-regulated during sporozoite passage through the hemolymph included several implicated in phagocytosis  and redox metabolism . additionally, the transcript of an uncharacterized gene , encoding a domain with homology to mammalian β-defensin, was significantly up-regulated in hemocytes at day  <dig> after p. berghei infection. the drosophila homolog of this gene has previously been reported to be up-regulated in oncogenic larval hemocytes  <cit> , and it possibly represents a novel antimicrobial peptide induced by, and with activity against, sporozoites.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> genes expressed in adult female an. gambiae hemocytes, including  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed following bacterial challenge and/or malaria parasite infection. a dominant proportion of these regulated genes was represented by  <dig> recognized immunity-related genes, of which many have known or putative roles in defense against p. berghei and other species of plasmodium. this pattern is fully consistent with hemocytes having an important role in regulating mosquito innate immune responses. transcriptomic profiling of an. gambiae hemocytes following exposures to various microbes also revealed distinct transcriptomes in response to different species of pathogen and at different stages of infection with the same pathogen. a closer examination of these differential transcriptome signatures provided numerous insights to potentially important functional attributes of hemocyte -mediated defenses. for example, the profound transcriptional response upon challenge with m. luteus and the much weaker and mainly down-regulated gene response after e. coli challenge, taken together with the reported higher virulence of e. coli to an. gambiae, suggests that the potency of the immune response activated by these two bacterial species is quite different  <cit> .

the distinct transcriptional profiles associated with the two different stages of the malaria parasite infection likely reflects differences in where parasites are located within the mosquito, antigenic differences between ookinetes and sporozoites, and/or temporal differences associated with blood-feeding or age of the mosquito hosts  <cit> . of particular interest was the co-regulation in hemocytes of different members of the imd/rel <dig> and jnk immune signaling pathways, together with various components of hat/hdac multiprotein complexes that regulate immune gene expression through modification of chromatin structure. these gene expression signatures are discussed in additional file  <dig>  data section s <dig>  the lack of a transcripional phagocytic response to sporozoite infection is in agreement with the recent finding that the rapid disappearance of p. berghei sporozoites from the hemolymph of an. gambiae apparently results from currently uncharacterized, non-phagocytic and humoral immune mechanisms  <cit> . finally, the transcriptomic profiles of hemocytes described in our study revealed that several factors known to influence plasmodium infection are not only induced in the midgut epithelium during ookinete invasion but are also simultaneously up-regulated in hemocytes   <cit> . this observation raises questions about the site of action of these immunity-related factors, and whether these molecules have similar or different functions in different tissues. future challenges, therefore, will be to dissect the contribution of differential gene expression in hemocytes in defense against different species of plasmodium, and to investigate the functional significance of the many novel candidate immunity-related and other genes, identified in this study.
