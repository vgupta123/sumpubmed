BACKGROUND
for annual plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana, proper determination of the flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success because a switch from vegetative to reproductive development is irreversible. consequently, the transition to flowering is under strict genetic and environmental control  <cit> , with floral initiation being induced by both external  and internal pathways  . day length has a strong influence on flowering time and for some plants, termed long-day  plants, exceeding of critical day length is necessary for the transition to flowering. in contrast, short-day  plants start to flower only when the day length is shorter than a critical value, and there are also plants that are photoperiod neutral. dependence of floral induction on day length differs between species and even accessions within a single species  <cit> . a. thaliana is a facultative ld plant, meaning that it proceeds to flowering when day length exceeds a threshold, but it can also flower in a delayed fashion under sd conditions  <cit> .

analysis of mutants with abnormal flowering time has allowed the identification of genes controlling floral transition  <cit> . at least  <dig> genes have been described as participants in flowering regulation  <cit> . the photoperiod-dependent pathway of floral promotion converges on the gene constans , which is known to be expressed in a circadian manner  <cit> . co is a direct activator of flowering locus t , a so-called florigen  <cit> . ft is a small protein that transfers flowering induction signals from leaves into the shoot apical meristem , where it interacts with the flowering locus d  product, a bzip transcription factor, to promote flowering  <cit> . another floral integrator is suppressor of overexpression of co  <dig> , which is characterized by an early activation in the transition to flowering, marking the switch from a vegetative meristem to inflorescence  <cit> . the activation of soc <dig> under ld conditions depends on ft and fd  <cit> . another element in this complex system is leafy , a floral integrator whose expression increases in the sam during the transition to flowering  <cit> . lfy is a positive regulator of apetala <dig>  and expression of ap <dig> therefore increases later than lfy  <cit> . after flowering initiation, the action of lfy and ap <dig>  as well as cauliflower  results in the upregulation of genes that control floral organ identity .

an alternative way to promote flowering involves the exposure of plants to low temperature, a process called vernalization. the key integrator of the vernalization pathway is a mads-box transcription factor, flowering locus c , which functions as a repressor of flowering and whose expression decreases during vernalization  <cit> . vernalization insensitive  <dig>  and vernalization  <dig> /vin3-like  <dig>  genes are known to be involved in chromatin modification that leads to the repression of flc expression  <cit> . expression of flc in accessions that are insensitive to cold treatment  is reduced by an autonomous pathway  <cit> . an interplay between flc and genes involved in photoperiodic activation of flowering has also been reported  <cit> . finally, the mads-box transcription factor short vegetative phase  is known to act together with flc to suppress flowering  <cit> .

despite this extensive knowledge of the behavior of key regulatory genes involved in the transition to flowering, the composition and dynamics of the underlying global genetic networks at the transcriptome level are still poorly understood. a recent study by torti et al.  focused on an analysis of the a. thaliana sam during transition to flowering and reported gene expression profiles from three developmental stages of meristems, providing useful, although not high-resolution, data. another study described the development of the inflorescence meristem  and floral meristem, a process that takes place after the transition to flowering  <cit> ; however, the mechanisms involved in transforming a vegetative meristem  into an im are still unclear.

in this current study we analyzed the dynamics of gene expression in a. thaliana meristem during the transition to flowering using rna sequencing . this technology allows the determination of genome-wide expression levels as well as the identification of novel transcripts and isoforms. rna-seq has been successfully used in studies of numerous plant species, including a. thaliana, rice , soybean , maize  as well as non-model species, such as wild strawberry  . the most common experimental approach for studies of flowering transition involves growing plants under sd for several days before transferring them to ld. this allows for the synchronization of flowering initiation when plants are placed under permissive photoperiod conditions and thus helps to track processes involved in flowering  <cit> . it should be noted that under natural growth conditions plants develop without such dramatic increases in day length. we used ld grown plants, which more closely approximates native conditions, and collected meristems at ten developmental stages to obtain a high-resolution data set, thus allowing a detailed evaluation of the processes that accompany the conversion of a vm to an im.

RESULTS
morphology of the meristem in the course of transition to flowering
a. thaliana sams were collected at ten stages from  <dig> to 16 days after germination . due to the developmental variability that occurs even in highly homozygous populations, harvested plants were synchronized by morphological markers: the number and structure of leaves and flowers. plants at 7 days after germination  had the first and second leaves visible, leaf  <dig> had trichomes and the last visible leaf primordium was the sixth. stage m <dig>  was characterized by 1- <dig> visible leaves at the whole-rosette level, the first and second leaves had a central vein with a length 50 % that of the leaf length, leaf  <dig> had trichomes and the last visible primordium was the eighth. at 9 days after germination  leaves  <dig> and  <dig> contained a central vein with a length 90 % that of the leaf length, leaf  <dig> was visible at the whole-rosette level, leaf  <dig> had trichomes and the last visible primordium was the ninth. at stage m <dig>  leaf  <dig> was visible, leaves  <dig> and  <dig> had a central vein with a length 90 % that of the leaf length, leaf  <dig> had trichomes and the last visible primordium was the thirteenth. stage m <dig>  was characterized by a visible leaf  <dig> at the whole-rosette level, leaves  <dig> and  <dig> were approximately 1 cm in length, leaf  <dig> had a central vein length that was 50 % that of the total leaf length, leaf  <dig> had trichomes, and the last visible primordium was the fourteenth. after 12 days of plant development  no new organs had emerged, but the whole plant had increased in size. leaf  <dig> was  <dig>  cm long and had a central vein length 90 % that of the leaf length, leaf  <dig> was visible at a whole-rosette level, leaf  <dig> had triсhomes, and the last visible primordium was number  <dig>  the third leaf of plants at 13 days after germination  was 1 cm in length, leaf  <dig> was  <dig>  cm, leaf  <dig> was visible at the whole-rosette level, leaf  <dig> had triсhomes and the last visible primordium was the sixteenth or seventeenth. stage m <dig>  was characterized by the third leaf measuring  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm leaf  <dig>  leaf  <dig> was visible, there were triсhomes on the tenth leaf, there were a total of  <dig> or  <dig> leaves and  <dig> floral primordia were present   <cit> . at stage m <dig>  leaf  <dig> was visible at the whole-rosette level, leaf  <dig> had trichomes, there was a total of  <dig> or  <dig> leaves and 1– <dig> floral primordia at stages 2– <dig>  <cit> . at stage m <dig>  plants had ten visible leaves at the whole-rosette level and 1– <dig> floral primordia at stages 3– <dig>  <cit> .

transcriptome sequencing of sams
pools of samples comprising  <dig> hand-dissected sams for each stage  were harvested in two biological replicates. total rna was extracted and used for library construction and sequenced using illumina protocols. after removal of low-quality reads, > <dig> million uniquely mapped reads were retained for further analysis from each sample . pearson r <dig> correlation values for all replicates varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , indicating consistency of the raw data. in total, the expression of  <dig>  distinct genes was detected, with a slight difference between the numbers of expressed genes between the samples: the highest number of transcripts  was detected in the stage m <dig> sample and the lowest  in the М <dig> sample . a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be expressed in all  <dig> samples .fig.  <dig> scanning electron micrographs  and photographs showing the developmental stages of the shoot apical meristem . the region that was collected as the meristem sample is false colored green in the sem images. leaves covering the meristem were removed. the rosette photographs provide a whole-plant view at the stages of collection

fig.  <dig> gene expression during meristem development.  number of expressed genes at each stage averaged for two replicates.  time series divided in four stages: vegetative development, transition to flowering, flowering and flower development. the number of differentially expressed  genes is indicated for comparison of each stage with the previous stage. expression profiles of key genes that regulate the flowering process are presented



differential gene expression and transcriptional dynamics of key flowering regulators
the number of differentially expressed  genes varied from  <dig>  between stages m <dig> and m <dig>  to  <dig>  between stages m <dig> and m <dig> . a substantial increase in the number of de genes  was observed between m4–m <dig> and m5–m <dig> , while the number when comparing m <dig> with m <dig> decreased to  <dig> . a second spike of differential expression was observed from m <dig> to m <dig>  which may be associated with the formation of floral primordia. to confirm that the data are in agreement with reports in the literature we evaluated the expression dynamics of known key regulators of the transition to flowering and, to this end, the genes for the main negative and positive regulator of flowering  were chosen as reference markers. according to previously published data, the expression of flc decreases during floral transition while the expression of lfy increases  <cit>  and these trends were also observed in our rna-seq data .

the formation of leaf primordia as a part of the vegetative meristem developmental program takes place during stages m <dig> to m <dig>  at these stages flc is characterized by a five-fold reduction of expression while lfy is expressed at low levels. another negative flowering regulator, svp, is highly expressed in the meristems until the early stages of bolting and in flower primordia  <cit> . consistent with this, we found the expression of svp to be high and to increase in this period of the time series. one of the earliest genes activated in the transition to flowering, soc <dig>  was found to show a five-fold increase in expression during stages m1–m <dig> and a three-fold increase in expression during m3–m <dig>  while fd is highly expressed in sams before floral induction and undergoes a further increase in expression at later stages  <cit> . indeed, we found that between m <dig> and m <dig> the expression of fd increased  <dig> -fold. during the m4–m <dig> stages, expression of both flc and lfy was maintained at low levels, while soc <dig> expression decreased two-fold between m <dig> and m <dig>  to form a sharp local peak of expression at the m <dig> stage. expression of genes from the squamosa promoter binding like  family has been shown to increase in sams in response to ld conditions  <cit>  and spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> take part in the transition to flowering upstream of apetala <dig>  , with spl <dig> and spl <dig> specifically participating in leaf primordium initiation  <cit> . accordingly, for these two genes we found a peak of expression at m <dig> and the onset of a general increase at m <dig> 

from m <dig> to m <dig>  flc expression decreased to very low levels and lfy expression increased four-fold compared to m <dig>  there was also a continued increase in expression of soc <dig> . the expression of spl <dig> and spl <dig> started to increase at stage m <dig>  which is consistent with in situ hybridization analyses where spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> expression was not detected in the vegetative meristem  <cit> . spl <dig> and spl <dig> expression increased from m <dig> to m <dig>  in m <dig> ap <dig> expression increased from undetectable levels and cal also expression increased from background levels . after the m <dig> stage an initiation of floral primordia in the sam occurs. flc expression decreases to almost zero and lfy showed a slightly increase in expression. at this point, the activation of genes involved in floral organ identity takes place and we observed that genes such as apetala <dig>  pistillata and agamous, all well-known regulators of flower development, showed an increase their transcript abundance from zero to their maximum levels at m <dig> .

thus, according to the expression dynamics of flc, lfy and other regulators of the transition to flowering, our time series can be divided into four main parts: first, stages m1–m <dig>  where flc expression is decreased and lfy is expressed at low levels ; second, m4–m <dig> ; third, m6–m <dig> ; and fourth, m8-m <dig>  . the transitional stage is of particular interest because of the equal expression levels of negative and positive regulators and a spike in differentially expressed genes in m <dig>  notably, no new organs formed between the m <dig> and m <dig> time points, suggesting that the reprogramming of the meristem from vegetative development to reproductive development is the primary event associated with these patterns. as far as we are aware, this particular developmental stage has not previously been characterized by detailed transcriptome profiling and we propose that a detailed analysis of genes that are up- and downregulated at this point will give new insights into the molecular pathways involved in this transition.

gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes at the transitional stage
we characterized the de genes based on gene ontology, several protein domain databases , the kegg pathway database as well as other databases with the david bioinformatics resources  <dig>   <cit>  . enriched terms that characterized the downregulated genes in the m4–m <dig> comparison and upregulated genes in the m <dig> and m <dig> stages, contained categories associated with cytoskeleton organization and movement , chromatin modification and dna replication , atpase activity  and kinases  . enriched categories for the upregulated genes in the m4–m <dig> comparison and the downregulated genes in the m5–m <dig> comparison were related to nucleosome assembly , tubulins  and ribosome biogenesis and structure . genes that were downregulated from stage m <dig> to m <dig> belong to categories such as cell cycle regulation and dna replication  while upregulated genes were enriched in the nucleotide metabolism  category.

gene clusters
to identify groups of genes associated with meristem development, we performed a clustering analysis based on expression profiles and the go analysis of the resulting data. to obtain the most accurate clustering we used the k-means method with a  <dig>  repeats and constructed hierarchical trees based on the distance matrix produced . this allows the separation of genes while avoiding the stochastic nature of k-means clustering. the first clustering step yielded  <dig>  clusters containing  <dig>  genes . the number of genes in the clusters varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with a median of  <dig>  which was not sufficient for an effective go enrichment analysis. moreover, many clusters had similar expression profiles. thus, super-clusters were generated using the mean expression profiles of the previously obtained clusters. as a result,  <dig> super-clusters were generated, containing  <dig>  genes . for each super-cluster the mean expression profile was calculated and go enrichment was determined . twelve superclusters have expression profiles with generally uniform expression at all stages, with the exception of m <dig> where expression is distinctly higher and maximal in profile . genes in such superclusters are enriched in annotated functions associated with biogenesis of ribosomes, histones, nucleosomes, chromatin modification and mrna splicing. superclusters with the opposite profile , such as superclusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  are enriched in the terms atpase and nucleotide binding, helicases and pentatricopeptide repeats. another category comprises superclusters with downregulated genes in m <dig> and upregulated in m <dig> . terms enriched in these superclusters are associated with biogenesis and structure of ribosomes and photosystems.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of super-clusters. for specific super-clusters profiles of relative expression values are shown.  super-clusters with profiles that have a pronounced spike at m <dig>   superclusters of genes with decreased expression at the m <dig> stage.  profiles with decreased expression at m <dig> and a subsequent increase at m <dig>   profiles indicating increased expression at m <dig> and a subsequent decrease at m <dig>  bars indicate dispersion of normalized gene reads count



genes whose expression increased in m <dig> and decreased in m <dig> fell within superclusters related to the cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal movement , such as e.g. superclusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

analysis of specific gene classes
the de gene and super-cluster analysis suggested that genes responsible for chromatin organization, cytoskeletal function, dna synthesis and cell cycling were upregulated during the initiation of flowering. in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the dynamics of the gene expression, we chose several groups of genes for a more detailed analysis; specifically those encoding elements of the cytoskeleton , histone and histone modifiers, dna and rna polymerases, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and other genes related to cell-cycle factors. the expression of all actin genes except those that have known functions in floral structures was found to decline at the m <dig> stage but return to previous levels or increase at m <dig> . the actin depolymerizing factors  are proteins known to act in the remodeling of actin, thereby controlling its depolymerization  <cit> . actin monomers can then be used in new filament formation and adfs contribute to the dynamic state of the actin network  <cit> . the a. thaliana genome contains  <dig> adf genes  <cit> , of which most showed decreased expression at m <dig> and an increase at m <dig> . only a few adf genes exhibited dissimilar expression dynamics and these are all known to be expressed in specific plant structures, such as pollen  <cit> .

villins, of which there are five in a. thaliana  <cit> , are actin bundling proteins that can either protect actin from adfs or promote the severing of actin polymers  <cit> . in our rna-seq results all of the villin genes  showed a decrease in expression at the m <dig> stage . other gene products involved in stabilizing actin filaments in a. thaliana are fimbrins , which, in the meristems, were found to have a reduced expression from stage m <dig> to m <dig> . class xi myosins are fast processive molecular motors that play a role in the rapid dynamics of golgi stacks, mitochondria, peroxisomes and plastids . all the myosin genes detected in our study, as well as myosin-like genes, showed a decreased expression at m <dig> . while the genes encoding tubulin a and b, proteins that form microtubules, had a peak of expression at the m <dig> stage, while almost all the kinesins showed a decreased expression at this stage . histones comprised a significantly enriched category in the go enrichment analysis of genes that increased when comparing m <dig> and m <dig> while decreasing in m5–m <dig> and in super-clusters with a peak in m <dig>  twenty-eight of the  <dig> genes encoding histones showed maximal expression at stage m <dig> . among acetyl transferases, demethylases and methyl transferases, the majority of genes showed a decrease in expression at m <dig> , and while genes encoding the subunits of dna- and rna-polymerases were downregulated, other non-catalytic subunits common to nuclear dna-dependent rna polymerases showed the opposite profile . lastly, we looked at cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases , which function as key regulators of the cell cycle. we determined that cyclins a, b and t had the highest expression at m <dig> . taken together, the expression data strongly indicate significant changes in cell cycle progression at the m <dig> stage.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of specific gene classes. some groups of genes have a synchronized behavior.  genes that belong to type  of expression pattern have a pronounced peak in m <dig>   genes of type  are upregulated in m <dig> and m <dig>  with a decrease in m <dig>  relative expression values for the gene classes, normalized to the highest values for each gene, are presented



verification of data from the transition stage
since the rna-seq data from the initial experiment suggested that the m4–m <dig> time points are the major stages in the transition to flowering, we repeated the entire experiment for stages m3–m <dig> . tissues from each stage were collected in two replicates pooled from  <dig> plants grown under the same conditions and using the same morphological markers as previously described. normalized total gene read counts and pearson r <dig> correlation values, which were between  <dig>  and  <dig> , are shown in additional file  <dig>  de genes were identified for each pair of consecutive stages and these matched the lists of de genes from the first experiment in at least 50 % of the cases. the go enrichment analysis was similar in all the lists of down- or upregulated genes, with a 100 % match in most cases . in addition, the super-cluster profiles were very similar between the two experiments, with a similarity median of  <dig>  . for the gene classes described above the similarity median was  <dig>  .

discussion
the genes with the most striking changes in their expression profiles included histones, tubulins and cyclins, whose transcription is well known to be highly dependent on the cell cycle stage. their expression patterns have been well documented in artificially synchronized plant cell suspension cultures , and so our data point to processes in the development of the sam involving major cell cycle related events. to our knowledge, such processes have not previously been characterized at the molecular level in the sam, although changes in the cell proliferation rate occurring at the moment of the transition to flowering have been well documented in cytological studies, as described below.

two major expression patterns of cell cycle related genes in m4–m <dig> were:  a pronounced peak in m5; and  upregulation in m <dig> followed by a decline in m <dig> and reversion in m <dig>  histone gene transcription is well known to be tightly regulated during cell cycle progression  and mrna levels of all histones synchronously increase as cells enter the s phase, but then decrease to lower levels shortly after the end of s phase  <cit> . thus, histone mrna can be used as both a marker of s phase progression and as an indicator of the proliferation index of a given tissue in all organisms  <cit> . here, we found that almost all genes encoding histones and uncharacterized histone-like proteins exhibited the type  pattern . in addition, genes encoding components of the dna replication machinery exhibited the group  pattern; in plant cell cultures they are known to increase transcript abundance during late g <dig> and s phases  <cit> . in our experiment, both a. thaliana genes encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigens, pcnas  showed a clear single peak at m <dig> . rpa2/rpa32a and two rpa3-related genes  encoding subunits of replication protein a  showed a similar expression profile, while genes for variants of the third subunit  did not show differential expression . other dna replication related genes, which belonged to group , were rfc <dig>  encoding replication factor c <dig> . expression of the s phase-promoting checkpoint phosphatase cdc <dig> homolog  also showed a sharp peak of expression at m <dig> . this is of particular interest since in plant cell tissue culture this gene has been reported not to show cell cycle regulated expression  <cit> , contradicting studies from other organisms  <cit> . interestingly, yeast cdc <dig> has been shown to induce flowering in tobacco upon over-expression  <cit> .

importantly, a pattern similar to those of the above s phase related genes was also observed for transcripts whose presence is usually associated with the late g <dig> and mitosis stages. for example, the levels of mrnas encoding α- and β-tubulins clearly peaked at m <dig>  though in this case the profile differed slightly in that the mrna levels were high not only in m <dig> but also at early and late stages  . during mitosis, higher levels of tubulin monomers are required to form the mitotic spindle, so transcription of tubulin genes is elevated at the late g2/m phase of the cell cycle in many organisms, including plants  <cit> . this means that in m <dig> we observe a simultaneous upregulation of s phase and g2/m phase specific genes.

in addition, canonical  cyclin-dependent kinases also showed type  behavior at the m4–m <dig> stages . among several classes of cdk genes found in the a. thaliana genome, a single cdka gene and four cdkb genes are directly involved in cell cycle control  <cit> . in cell culture, cdka; <dig>  an ortholog of yeast cdc <dig> and animal cdk <dig> that is exclusively associated with the g1/s-specific cyclins, is constitutively expressed, while plant-specific cdkb <dig> and cdkb <dig> genes are associated with the g2/m peak of the mitotic cyclins . we found both the cdka and all four cdkb genes to be significantly upregulated at the m <dig> stage. we also observed an elevated expression of two genes encoding scaffold cdk subunits  at the same stage . ckss are components of the cdk-cyclin core complex, which have different expression patterns in cycling plant cells  <cit> . finally, three genes for siamese-related cell cycle inhibitors , which are thought to control mitosis, were also substantially upregulated at m <dig>  <cit> .

these results are congruent with the idea that a burst of cell division occurs in the sam at the m <dig> stage, accompanied by a shortening of the g <dig> and g <dig> phases . this was further supported by data from the gene ontology enrichment analysis, which revealed an upregulation of genes associated with nucleotide biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis, translation, mitochondria and chloroplast components at the same stage , pointing to an extensive proliferation peaking at this time point  <cit> . however, the expression profiles of several important cell cycle regulators, including cyclins, appear to complicate this hypothesis. plants have a complex set of genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-like proteins . in suspension-cultured cells, most a- and b-type  cyclins have been shown to have a uniform expression pattern, accumulating in late g <dig> with a peak in early mitosis  <cit> . the exceptions are cyca3; <dig>  cyca3; <dig> and cyca3; <dig>  which were predominantly expressed at the g1/s boundary and so actually represent g <dig> cyclins  <cit> . the expression of genes encoding for cyca1s, cycb1s and cycb2s are regulated by a common molecular mechanism that involves binding of the r1r2r3-myb transcription factors myb3r <dig> and myb3r <dig> to m phase-specific activator  elements in their promoters  <cit> . in our time course analysis, at least  <dig> of these genes, including cyca3; <dig>  showed the type  pattern, with a peak of expression at m <dig> and a subsequent decline at m <dig> . this correlated well with the expression of a gene encoding the msa-binding transcription factor myb3r <dig>  which also showed the type  pattern. cyca1; <dig> was the only mitotic cyclin that belonged to group , suggesting that this gene has some specific role in vivo. the expression of cyca3; <dig> and cycb1; <dig> did not vary significantly, while cyca2; <dig> showed a pattern that was not characterized by either type  or . thus, most of the cyclin a and cyclin b genes belonged to the type  group.fig.  <dig> a model explaining the observed changes in the expression level of cell cycle related genes during the floral transition of the shoot apical meristem . at stages before m <dig> cells cycle slowly due to long g <dig> and g <dig> phases. there is also a large proportion of non-cycling  cells. during floral transition , the cell cycle duration is shortened at the expense of the g <dig> and g <dig> phases, and many g0-arrested cells enter the cell cycle. subsequently, , the duration of the cycle increases again. typical expression patterns of cell cycle regulated genes are shown schematically in the lower panel 



genes encoding d-type cyclins did not show such a uniform expression profile. in synchronized suspension cell culture, they have been shown to have peaks of expression during the g <dig> phase and g1/s transition, although with a diversity of profiles: cycd5; <dig> and cycd3; <dig> mrnas accumulate in early g <dig> and levels then decline as cells move towards the s phase, whereas cycd4; <dig>  cycd4; <dig> and cycd3; <dig> mrnas accumulate in late g <dig> and peak at the g1/s boundary  <cit> . of the  <dig> cyclins in this class for which we were able to detect expression, two  exhibited type  expression, three  demonstrated high expression only in the m <dig> stage, one  peaked at m9–m <dig>  and the others showed no significant changes throughout the time period investigated .

most of the genes encoding e2f/dp/rb pathway components, which are known to be g1/s phase regulated , also belonged to the type  expression category . all three genes encoding apc activators for which we were able to detect transcripts  were similarly type , even though they demonstrated a m phase specific expression in cell culture  <cit> .

even more intriguing was the observation that some genes that were expressed at the same stage during cell cycle progression in plant cell culture showed the contrasting pattern of expression during the m4–m <dig> stage in our study of expression in sams. for example, tubulins and kinesins have previously been reported to show a simultaneous peak of expression in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . however, in our study, tubulin genes exhibited type  expression, while all genes encoding kinesins clearly demonstrated type  expression . the same was true for the pcna and mcm families, both of which comprise s phase specific genes  <cit> . while pcna <dig> and pcna <dig> grouped with the type  genes , several mcm genes  had the type  expression pattern . we suggest that the antitropic expression of genes encoding important cell cycle regulators occurring in the m <dig> stage can be explained by major developmental and physiological reorganization within the cells, which at that point are preparing to enter into extensive proliferation that occurs at m <dig>  we propose that at the m <dig> stage a fraction of cells from the vegetative meristem, which are slowly cycling and residing in the g <dig> phase, are activated and begin to move synchronously toward mitosis, while those cells residing in g <dig> start to prepare to enter the s phase. in m <dig>  they rapidly cycle without long g <dig> or g <dig> phases, while in m <dig> and subsequent stages the proliferation rate returns to the normal level. we suggest that ‘reformatting’ of the cell cycle in m <dig> sams underlies the non-canonical pattern of gene expression at this stage. at m <dig>  some non-dividing  cells that were present in the sam may also have entered into the division phase, as suggested by expression of some d-type cyclins.

the dramatic changes in the cell proliferation status of cells in the vegetative sam during the floral transition has previously been reported, but has not yet been characterized in molecular terms. specifically, since the 1960s, several groups have described this phenomenon extensively using cytological approaches, mostly based on studies of silene coeli-rosa  and sinapis alba l. , but also in a. thaliana and other species  to only a few hours . this dramatic reduction in the cell cycle duration was achieved mostly by a shortening of the g <dig> and g <dig> phases  <cit> , although some authors also reported a shortening of the s phase  <cit> . the latter was essentially achieved by an activation of latent dna replication origins  and was observed immediately prior to commitment to flowering  <cit> . in contrast, the changes in the duration of g <dig> and g <dig> proceeded in several stages. g <dig> was the longest phase of the cell cycle in the vegetative sam and g <dig> was the longest at later stages  <cit> . according to one detailed study, at the first stage a reduction in the length of the g <dig> phase of the rapidly cycling cells occurred together with a return of non-cycling g <dig> cells to the division cycle  <cit> . this contributed to the first mitotic wave in the inflorescence meristem. subsequently, a shortening of the g <dig> phase of the rapidly cycling cells and the release of some non-cycling g0/g <dig> cells into the s phase occurred contributing to the second mitotic wave. these observations are consistent with our hypothesis. second, the changes in the evoked meristem observed at the cytological level included a partial synchronization of cell divisions in the sam . this synchronization however could be suppressed under certain conditions  <cit>  indicating that it may be a side effect of the activation of cell division. the third observation was that the cell population of the meristem was heterogeneous, including zones of rapidly cycling and non-cycling cells. during the floral transition, the cell proliferation rate changed to differing extents between these zones  <cit> . all these processes contribute to the complex picture we observed at the molecular level.

we note that since all the above observations were made in an sd/ld-induced system, it was not possible to accurately determine whether the changes in cell division were caused by the induction stimulus itself, or indeed reflected authentic processes related to floral transition. in contrast, in the current study, with our morphology-driven synchronization approach we were able to determine unambiguously that the cell cycle related events are an integral part of the flowering program.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive high-resolution characterization of gene expression during floral transition in arabidopsis thaliana meristem. we found dramatic increase in number of differentially expressed genes at the point when a vegetative meristem transitions into an inflorescence. using analysis based on clustering of expression profiles we found coordinated changes in expression of genes involved in cell cycle. we hypothesize that at this point a subset of the meristematic cells experiences a forced exit from g <dig> and/or g <dig> and g <dig> shortening at day  <dig> and then an acceleration of the cell cycle occurs at day  <dig>  which may be linked to meristem reorganization preceding activation of lfy. we expect that further experiments will validate and elucidate the mechanism underlying these events.
