BACKGROUND
the last decade has seen significant advances in the field of transcription. the
discovery of nuclear histone acetyltransferases  in the mid nineties has
literally opened a new field of investigation into post-translational modifications
that target histones and modulate the chromatin state either locally or over large
genomic loci. the multiple types of modifications that take place on specific
histone residues and the regulatory cascades that can be triggered in this manner
led investigators to propose that a "histone code" regulates gene expression in a
manner reminiscent of the genetic code translating nucleic acid coding sequences
into protein sequences  <cit> . in parallel, a number of novel experimental approaches have
contributed to move the transcription field from a gene-by-gene approach focused on
core promoters to a genome-wide non-biased approach that enables us to study large
numbers of transcriptional targets as well as the mechanisms by which these targets
are regulated  <cit> . recent tools in our
arsenal include the increasing availability of genomic microarrays  <cit> , sirna-mediated gene knockdown  <cit> , more efficient virus-based gene delivery
systems  <cit> , and
high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . importantly,
the "rediscovery" of chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with the development of
microchip arrays containing large numbers of genomic sequences has opened new
horizons. indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation was first described in the mid
eighties by the group of john t. lis who used this assay to show that rna polymerase
ii molecules were already present at the 5' end of the hsp <dig> gene in uninduced cells
and that heat shock somehow enabled transcription elongation to take place
 <cit> . curiously, the method was not
applied to specific transcription factors before another decade  <cit> . interestingly, the genomic microarray that
was designed as part of the encode project provided a sampling of the human genome
that can be interrogated to define the distribution types of transcriptional
regulation of specific transcription factors  <cit> . the information thus gathered has forced us to reconsider
our original understanding of basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation
 <cit> . for example, a common belief
was that a specific transcription factor could bind to a few dozen genes whose core
promoters contain its consensus binding site as defined in vitro, and once
recruited to a promoter could almost single-handedly regulate transcription
 <cit> . we now know that c-myc binds
to approximately 20% of gene promoters and is also capable of regulating genes at a
distance  <cit> . another major conceptual advance concerns the criteria
to define a transcriptional target. experimental evidence typically included the
presence of a consensus binding motif within a core promoter, in vitro
binding assays and luciferase reporter assays. while these assays are still
employed, it is clear that they cannot provide definitive evidence that a
transcription factor regulates a specific gene. additional evidence must also
include chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to demonstrate "in vivo" dna binding,
and change in expression of the endogenous gene target in response to the knockdown
and/or overexpression of the transcription factor.

cut homeobox  <dig>  has previously been called ccaat-displacement protein
, cdp/cut and cut-like  <dig> . cux <dig> encodes two main
isoforms that exhibit different dna binding and transcriptional properties . the full-length protein, p200
cux <dig>  is a very abundant protein that binds dna with extremely fast kinetics
 <cit> . in mid-g <dig> phase, 1% to 10% of
p <dig> cux <dig> is proteolytically processed by a nuclear isoform of cathepsin l to
produce the p <dig> cux <dig> isoform  <cit> . this shorter isoform can stably interact with dna and,
depending on promoter-context, can function as transcriptional repressor or
activator  <cit> . the
expression and activity of p <dig> cux <dig> are tightly regulated in a cell cycle-dependent
manner, mostly through phosphorylation-dephosphorylation by cyclin a/cdk <dig>  cyclin
a/cdk <dig> cyclin b/cdk <dig>  and cdc25a, as well as proteolytic processing by nuclear
cathepsin l and a caspase-like protease  <cit> . these post-translational modifications circumscribe the
transcriptional activity of p <dig> cux <dig> to the period between mid-g <dig> to sometimes in
g <dig>  in contrast to p <dig> cux <dig>  the dna binding activity of p <dig> cux <dig> is constant
throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . its
transcriptional activity, if any, would be limited to the "caatt-displacement
activity", a mechanism of passive repression involving competition for binding site
occupancy  <cit> .

homozygous inactivation of cux <dig> in mice causes perinatal lethality in a
large proportion of animals due to delayed lung development and associated
respiratory failure  <cit> . surviving mice are
usually male and exhibit growth retardation, disrupted hair follicle morphogenesis,
purulent rhinitis, infertility, cachexia, and reduction of b and t cell content in
bone marrow and thymus, respectively  <cit> . in transgenic mouse
models, overexpression of cux <dig> generated various cancer-associated disorders
depending on the specific isoform and tissue type expression. these include
multi-organ organomegaly, glomerulosclerosis and polycystic kidneys, pre-cancerous
lesions in the liver, myeloproliferative-disease-like myeloid leukemias and mammary
tumors sometimes associated with lung metastasis  <cit> .
cell-based assays demonstrated a role for cux <dig> in cell cycle progression and cell
proliferation  <cit> ,
strengthening of the spindle assembly checkpoint  <cit> , cell migration and invasion  <cit> , resistance to apoptotic signals  <cit> , and dendrite branching and spine development
in cortical neurons  <cit> . which cux1
isoform is active in these processes cannot be determined from sirna or
shrna-mediated knockdown approaches, however, in overexpression studies the p110
cux <dig> isoform was shown to regulate transcription of genes involved in cell cycle
progression, dna damage response, spindle assembly checkpoint and cell motility.

many specific transcription factors are able bind to genomic sites that are far away
from tss. these studies also revealed that only about up to 10% of putative
transcriptional targets showed evidence of regulation in response to changes in
transcription factor concentrations  <cit> . whether cux <dig> binds
preferentially to core promoter sequences, like e2f <dig>  or whether it can also bind at
a distance from tss, like c-myc, has not been determined  <cit> . also, what proportion of all
cux <dig> targets is regulated in response to overexpression or silencing of cux <dig> is not
known. to begin to address these questions, we have performed chap-chip using encode
and promoter microarrays. putative targets were validated in independent chip
followed by q-pcr, while regulatory effects were measured in expression profiling
experiments and confirmed by rt-qpcr. the results show that cux <dig> binds to a large
number of genomic sites that are located far away from a tss and can regulate genes
at a distance even when another gene is located in the intervening region.

RESULTS
strategy to identify p <dig> cux <dig> binding sites
the overall goal of the present study was to define the modes of transcriptional
regulation by cux <dig> and, in particular, determine whether cux <dig> can regulate genes
at a distance. as detailed in the introduction, previous transcriptional studies
and cell-based assays have implicated the p <dig> cux <dig> isoform in transcriptional
activation and repression of target genes. since p <dig> cux <dig> is generated by
proteolytic processing, its primary sequence is included in the full-length cux1
protein sequence. consequently, all available antibodies that bind to p <dig> cux1
also recognize p <dig> cux <dig>  our strategy to identify in vivo binding sites for
p <dig> cux <dig> was to isolate chromatin by two different methods. first, we purified
chromatin by tandem affinity purification  using a population of hs578t
cells stably expressing moderate levels of a p <dig> cux <dig> protein with two epitope
tags at its c-terminus, p110-tag <dig> . chromatin isolated in this manner as well as total
chromatin  were used in hybridizations on the nimblegen hg <dig> encode high
density oligonucleotide tiling array. secondly, binding sites identified in the
microarray were then validated by performing independent chip in the parental
hs578t cells using cux <dig> antibodies,  <dig> and  <dig> . importantly, these cells express endogenous cux <dig> proteins only.
the strategy of chromatin affinity purification  followed by microarray
analysis  has previously been validated  <cit> , and described in detail  <cit> .

inhibitory domain; cc, coiled-coil; cr <dig>  cr <dig> and cr <dig>  cut repeat  <dig>  2
and 3; hd homeodomain; cbd, calmodulin binding domain; prot a, protein
a. the regions recognized by the  <dig> and  <dig> antibodies are shown.
 hs578t cells were infected with a retroviral vector to
establish a population of cells stably expressing a recombinant p110
cux <dig> protein with two tags at its c-terminus, p <dig> cux1-tag <dig> 
a population stably carrying the empty vector was used as a control.
nuclear extracts were prepared from each population of cells and
analyzed by western blot using the  <dig> and  <dig> cux <dig> antibodies.

distribution of cux <dig> binding sites on the encode array
using a stringent false discovery rate ,  <dig> cux <dig> binding
sites were identified on the encode array .
the recruitment of cux <dig> to  <dig> out of  <dig> genomic sites  was validated in
quantitative-pcr assays using chromatin that was independently obtained from
hs578t cells by immunoprecipitation with cux <dig> antibodies .  <dig> % of probes on the encode array derive from
transcribed genomic regions.  <dig> % of cux <dig> binding sites were located within
transcribed regions, indicating a  <dig> -fold enrichment in non-transcribed
regions. in comparison, data obtained from chip on the encode platform
 <cit>  for c-myc reveals a  <dig> 
fold enrichment in non-transcribed regions while e2f <dig> showed a strong enrichment
for transcribed regions .

the atcrat consensus sequence as well as for sites that did not.

mapping of cux <dig> binding sites relative to transcription start sites 
generated a bell-shaped curve of low height around tss .  <dig> % of all binding sites overlapped a tss, and an
additional 17% and 16% of binding sites were respectively located in the  <dig> kbp
region upstream and downstream of a tss. the number of binding sites gradually
declined with increasing distance. yet, over 6% and 8% of binding sites were
situated at more than  <dig>  bp upstream or downstream, respectively, from
the closest tss. 53% of cux <dig> binding sites are located more than  <dig>  bp
away from a tss and approximately 14% of all cux <dig> binding sites are situated at
more than  <dig>  bp from a tss.
transcription start sites.  percentage of cux <dig> binding
sites located at various distances from the closest transcription start
site. the "0" column indicates genes where the cux <dig> binding site
overlaps the start site.  location of c-myc binding sites as
per a.  location of e2f <dig> binding sites as per

we compared the distribution of cux <dig> binding sites with those of  <dig> randomly
generated sets of binding sites, as well as those of c-myc and e2f <dig> using the
data of bieda et al.,  <dig>  <cit> 
. we note that the distributions
of randomly generated sets of binding sites exhibited flatter bell-shaped curves
around tss . we conclude
that the higher frequency of cux <dig> binding sites close to tss reflects the
preferential recruitment of cux <dig> to promoter regions. the same cannot be said
regarding the binding sites that are located at more than  <dig> kbp from tss, since
the same proportions of randomly generated binding sites were located in these
regions.

in contrast to cux <dig> and c-myc, the e2f <dig> transcription factor was found to bind
almost exclusively to the region immediately adjacent to tss. the preference of
e2f <dig> to core promoter regions led the authors to posit that e2f <dig> is recruited
via protein interactions with components of the general transcription machinery
 <cit> . the wider distribution of
binding sites observed for cux <dig> and c-myc is also observed for other
transcription factors  <cit>  , while other factors show a preference
for tss similarly to e2f <dig> . yet other factors show different patterns of binding, such as pax <dig> 
which exhibits preference for non-promoter cpg islands and a tendency to bind in
the 10– <dig> kbp range rather than close to the tss of genes  <cit> .

binding of cux <dig> to distant regulatory elements
we compared the location of cux <dig> binding sites that are more than  <dig> kb from the
nearest tss to dnase hypersensitivity mappings and chromhmm data in human
mammary epithelial cells from published datasets. dnase hypersensitivity sites
have been used as markers of regulatory dna elements such as enhancers,
silencers, insulators and locus control regions  <cit> . chromhmm is a computational method that
compiles data from histone modification mappings and integrates them to predict
genomic elements such as enhancers  <cit> .
this analysis revealed that respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % of distantly located
cux <dig> binding sites are present within 1 kb of a dnase hypersensitivity site
and of an enhancer predicted . both of these
proportions are greater than what is seen for randomly distributed binding
sites. however, there was no enrichment of cux <dig> binding sites in proximity of
insulator elements . these results are in
agreement with the notion that cux <dig> can perform some regulatory functions when
binding at a distance from transcription start sites.
and dhs sites

percentages of cux <dig> binding sites located more than  <dig> kbps away from
a tss but within  <dig> kbp of the indicated type of genomic element.
percentages are shown for a set of randomly generated binding sites
of the same size distribution as cux <dig>  p value is calculated using a
fisher's exact test. see methods for information on the datasets
used.

detection of cux <dig> binding sites and consensus binding motif on promoter
arrays
promoter microarrays are useful because they enable one to interrogate easily
over  <dig>  gene promoters. a limitation is that only a limited amount of
promoter sequences can be included for each gene, precluding the detection of
far away binding sites that could play a role in transcriptional regulation.
based on the localization of cux <dig> binding sites on the encode array, we
calculated that between  <dig> % to  <dig> % of cux <dig> binding sites would be identified
on commercially available promoter arrays .
however, since for many distant cux <dig> binding sites another binding site is also
present close to the transcription start site, we estimated that between  <dig> %
to  <dig> % of gene targets would be identified on distinct promoter arrays
. in contrast, as e2f <dig> is targeted to
transcription start sites, between  <dig> % to  <dig> % of e2f <dig> binding sites would be
expected to be identified on a promoter array.

we verified these predictions by performing a chap-chip experiment using the
nimblegen promoter microarray. total chromatin  as well as purified
chromatin from hs578t cells expressing p <dig> cux1-tag <dig> were used in hybridization
on the promoter array of nimblegen. using a stringent false discovery rate
,  <dig> cux <dig> binding sites were identified on  <dig> gene
promoters . the recruitment of cux <dig> to 25
out of  <dig> genomic sites  was validated in quantitative-pcr assays using
chromatin that was independently obtained from hs578t cells by
immunoprecipitation with cux <dig> antibodies .
the vast majority of target genes  contained only one cux <dig> binding site,
yet a sizable fraction contained  <dig> or more binding sites .

according to the predictions shown in table  <dig>   <dig> %
of cux <dig> target genes should be identified on the promoter array from nimblegen.
we calculated the proportion of encode genes with a cux <dig> binding site that were
also identified as putative targets of cux <dig> in the promoter array. when we
considered all  <dig> cux <dig> binding sites and  <dig> adjacent encode genes, we found
that  <dig> genes  were identified in the promoter array . when we considered only the  <dig> encode
genes that were regulated in response to changes in cux <dig> levels , we
found that  <dig> genes  were identified as putative target of cux <dig> in the
promoter array .

the cux <dig> consensus binding site, atcrat , was found
to be present at  <dig> % of the  <dig> bound genomic sites . this frequency was judged to be significant as the cux1
consensus binding site was found to be present in only  <dig> % of  <dig> randomly
chosen regions of equal size. notably, the gc content between bound and unbound
regions is practically identical, and thus cannot account for the difference in
binding site occurrence . yet, only  <dig> %
 of the cux <dig> consensus sites present on the array were bound in
vivo. we conclude that the cux <dig> consensus binding site plays a role in
the recruitment of cux <dig> at specific genomic locations, but the presence of a
consensus site is not sufficient.

searched for the presence of the cux <dig> consensus binding site: ***:
p <  <dig> . column  <dig> shows the gc content of bound and
unbound regions.

identification of binding motifs in genomic regions bound by cux1
we envisioned that interactions with other transcription factors play an
important role in recruiting cux <dig> to specific locations. in agreement with this
notion, functional analysis revealed distinct sets of cellular functions among
gene targets that contain an atcrat consensus and those that do not
. to
further test the possibility that cux <dig> may interact with other factors, we
investigated the presence of binding motifs other than that of cux <dig> using the
meme suite of analysis tools . we first tested the reliability
of the tool by using it to find motifs in the sequences of cux <dig> bs in which we
had independently determined that they contained the established atcrat
consensus. as expected, it identified the atcrat consensus as the most enriched
motif in the set of sequences, by a vast margin . we then analyzed binding motifs in the two sets of
cux <dig> binding sites: those that contained the atcrat motif and those that did
not. while the size of bound regions varied from  <dig> to 1107 bp, the
average size was  <dig> and 477 bp, respectively. interestingly, only one
common binding motif was found in the two sets, while the rest of the binding
motifs were unique to each set . extending the search to the 500 bp regions on
either side of bound regions did not highlight other differences between the two
sets or reveal additional contributing factors . these findings support the notion
that targeting of cux <dig> to specific genomic sites is influenced by
protein-protein interactions with other dna binding proteins.

regulatory effects of cux <dig> on putative targets
to verify the effect of cux <dig> on putative targets, we performed expression
profiling on three hs578t cell populations: cells that had been infected with a
retrovirus expressing an shrna against cux <dig>  cells infected with a retrovirus
expressing p <dig> cux <dig>  or cells infected with an empty retrovirus. in each case,
replicate microarray hybridizations were carried out such that a p value could
be calculated for each difference in gene expression. results from expression
profiling were validated by repeating the infections and performing rt-qpcr
analysis on  <dig> genes whose expression went up or down in response to one
treatment or the other . all genes tested
in this manner displayed changes in gene expression in the same direction as
that observed in the microarray hybridization: genes that were repressed in
expression profiling were also repressed when mrna levels were measured by
rt-qpcr. similar observations were made for genes that were activated. we note,
however, that the fold activation or repression calculated by rt-qpcr were not
necessarily proportional to the changes observed in microarray hybridization.
for example, eef1a <dig> and c20orf <dig> mrna were increased respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> 
fold when measured by rt-qpcr, but were increased  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold in microarray
analyses. some of these differences could be due to the fact that measurements
by the two methods were made with rna prepared from independent experiments.
notwithstanding the differences in magnitude, the effects of cux <dig> on gene
expression was confirmed for all tested genes.

down-regulated and a p value below  <dig> , we observed differences in the
expression of  <dig> target genes , following changes in cux <dig> levels
.  <dig> genes responded to cux1
knockdown, and  <dig> genes, to p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression . among the  <dig> regulated target genes,  <dig> genes  were
activated and  <dig> genes  were repressed by cux <dig> . similar proportions of activated and repressed genes were found
when a cut-off of 25% change in gene expression was employed . these findings confirm that p <dig> cux <dig> can participate
in transcriptional activation or repression depending on promoter context.

similar results were obtained when we analyzed the expression of putative targets
identified on the promoter array. a total of  <dig> genes,  <dig> % of all putative
targets for which expression profiling results could be matched, were regulated
by cux <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes exhibited regulation in response to cux <dig> knockdown or
p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression, respectively.  <dig>  were up-regulated by cux1
while  <dig>  were down-regulated by cux <dig> 

effect of distance on transcriptional regulation by cux1
we noted that cux <dig> regulated  <dig> % and  <dig> % of putative targets from the encode
and the promoter arrays, respectively. we next investigated the relationship
between the position of a cux <dig> binding site relative to a transcription start
site and the probability of a gene to be regulated in response to changes in
cux <dig> levels. when genes were classified according to the distance between the
cux <dig> binding site and the transcription start site, we did not observe
significant difference in the fraction of targets that were regulated by cux1
. however, we observed much
variability in the fraction of regulated genes because the number of genes
within some distance intervals were very small. therefore, to increase the
sample size, we repeated the analysis this time using a cut-off of 25% either up
or down and a p value below  <dig>  .
we observed differences in the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in response to cux1
shrna and cux <dig> overexpression, respectively . again, more genes were found to be regulated by cux <dig> using the
shrna approach. among genes that exhibited regulation by cux <dig>   <dig> genes 
were activated by cux <dig>  and  <dig> genes  were repressed by cux1
. the histogram presenting the
percentage of regulated genes versus the distance of cux <dig> binding sites to tss
shows that essentially the same proportion of genes are regulated whether cux1
binds close or far away from the tss .
indeed, no statistical difference was observed between genes bound at the tss
and those bound more than  <dig> kbp away. we conclude that cux <dig> can activate or
repress transcription when bound at a distance from a transcription start
site.
the encode array have been organized according to the distance between
their transcription start site  and the closest cux <dig> binding site.

effect of gene position on transcriptional regulation by cux1
intuitively, one would assume that a transcription factor is more likely to
regulate the closest promoter. yet, some enhancers will exhibit an effect on a
promoter situated on one side, but no effect on the promoter that is on the
other side on the map. this sort of selectivity between an enhancer and a
promoter has been explained by the presence of boundary or insulator elements or
by specific interactions between proteins bound at the enhancer and the
regulated promoter. previous studies on cux <dig> have all focused on genes that
contain a cux <dig> binding site within the immediate promoter. to begin to
investigate the rules that govern the action of cux <dig>  we calculated the fraction
of different types of cux <dig> targets that were regulated in response to changes in
cux <dig> levels. three types of genes were analyzed:  <dig>  genes that are the closest
to the cux <dig> binding site;  <dig>  genes that are further away and in the other
direction from the cux <dig> binding site;  <dig>  genes that are located further away and
are separated by another gene from the cux <dig> binding site. for each category, we
calculated the percentage of genes that exhibit a  <dig>  or  <dig> -fold change in
expression following p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown. strikingly,
essentially similar fractions of genes were regulated whether they were closest
to the cux <dig> binding site or were located further away in the other direction
. moreover, the
proportion of regulated genes was not significantly lower among genes that
belong to the third category . we conclude that cux <dig> is capable of regulating genes at a distance.
moreover, cux <dig> can regulate more than one gene on certain genomic loci.
types of situations are depicted in the diagram.  <dig>  genes that are the
closest to the cux <dig> binding site;  <dig>  genes that are further away and in
the other direction from the cux <dig> binding site;  <dig>  genes that are
located further away and are separated by another gene from the cux1
binding site. for each category, the table shows the percentage of genes
that exhibit a  <dig>  or  <dig>  change in expression following p <dig> cux1
overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown.

discussion
genome-wide location analysis on the encode array revealed that ~47% of cux <dig> binding
sites are located in the 4-kbp region upstream and downstream of a tss, while more
than 14% of cux <dig> binding sites are situated at more than  <dig> kbp from a tss
. overall,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of putative
targets on the encode and promoter arrays respectively, exhibited a  <dig> -fold change
in expression following cux <dig> knockdown or p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression
.
this proportion is within the 1-10% range of potential targets that have been
reported to be regulated by other transcription factors  <cit> .
cux <dig> overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown 

number and percentage of all genes and cux <dig> target genes on the promoter
array that exhibit a  <dig>  fold change in expression following p <dig> cux1
overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown. genes were analyzed as in
table  <dig> 
cux <dig> overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown 

number and percentage of all genes and cux <dig> target genes on the promoter
array that exhibit a  <dig>  fold change in expression following p <dig> cux1
overexpression or cux <dig> knockdown. "upregulated by cux1" are genes whose
expression is increased following p <dig> cux <dig> and/or decreased following
cux <dig> knockdown. conversely, "downregulated by cux1" are genes whose
expression is decreased following p <dig> cux <dig> and/or increased following
cux <dig> knockdown. the total number of genes and target genes were 17586
and  <dig>  respectively.

importantly, analysis of the percentage of regulated genes versus the distance of
cux <dig> binding sites to tss showed that essentially the same proportion of genes are
regulated whether cux <dig> binds close or far away from the tss . in other words, the probability that a gene is
regulated by cux <dig> is not affected by the distance between the cux <dig> binding site and
the tss. in addition, our results indicate that the position of genes relative to a
cux <dig> binding site do not determine whether these genes are regulated by cux <dig>  cux1
regulated similar percentages of genes whether they were closest to the cux <dig> binding
site or were located further away in the other direction . moreover, cux <dig> regulated a surprisingly high
proportion  of genes that were separated from their binding site by another
gene . altogether these results demonstrate
that cux <dig> can regulate genes at a distance and can regulate more than one gene on
certain genomic loci.

the proportion of target genes that were found to be activated or repressed by cux <dig> 
respectively 52% and 48% , is significantly
different from what we reported in previous studies on target genes involved in cell
cycle progression, cell motility, or the dna damage response  <cit> . in each case, a vast majority of genes were found to be
activated by p <dig> cux <dig>  whether we performed sirna-mediated knockdown or
overexpression of p <dig> cux <dig>  one factor that may explain this could be the
functional classes of genes that were studied previously. the functional class of
“cell cycle” genes includes mostly genes that stimulate cell cycle
progression. out of  <dig> cell cycle gene targets identified by chip-chip,  <dig> were
activated and  <dig> were repressed by cux <dig> 
 <cit> . one of the two repressed
genes, p21waf1/cki <dig>  code for a cdk-inhibitor that blocks cell cycle
progression, while the other, ccnh, is involved in transcription and dna repair. all
target genes that were activated play a positive role in cell cycle progression.
similarly, among  <dig> targets that play a role in dna damage response,  <dig> were
activated and one was repressed  <cit> . the
repressed gene again was p21waf1/cki <dig>  overall, these results are
consistent with the notion that cux <dig> establishes a transcriptional program that
promotes cell cycle progression and at the same time ensures the maintenance of
genetic integrity.

we employed two experimental approaches to examine the transcriptional regulation of
genes by cux <dig>  expression profiling was performed following shrna-mediated knockdown
of cux <dig> or p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression. among targets identified on the promoter array,
 <dig> genes exhibited a  <dig> -fold change in expression following cux <dig> knockdown, while
 <dig> genes were regulated in response to p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression. therefore, more
genes were found to be regulated by cux <dig> using the shrna approach. this result can
be interpreted to mean that cux <dig> is required for optimal expression of many target
genes, however, increasing cux <dig> expression is not sufficient to modulate the
expression of some target genes.

the cux <dig> consensus binding site, atcrat , was found to
be present at  <dig> % of the  <dig> bound genomic sites . we conclude that the presence of a cux <dig> consensus binding site
contributes to, but is not sufficient for, the recruitment of cux <dig> to specific
genomic locations. we envision that interactions with other transcription factors
play an important role in recruiting cux <dig> to specific locations. in agreement with
this notion, functional analysis revealed distinct sets of cellular functions among
gene targets that contain an atcrat consensus and those that do not
. we note
that functional classes involved in cell cycle were over-represented among target
genes that do not contain a consensus cux <dig> binding site . in previous studies, cux <dig> was shown to interact with e2f factors
and cooperate with these factors in the regulation of several cell cycle genes
 <cit> . it is
likely that protein-protein interaction with e2f factors reduces the requirement for
the presence of a high-affinity binding site for the recruitment of cux <dig> on this
class of genes.

cux <dig> can be purified efficiently by immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography.
following cross-linking, however, the yield of purification is drastically reduced
such that we need  <dig> million cells to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation or
affinity purification  for cux <dig>  this caveat has limited our ability
to perform chip-sequencing and therefore our study relied on microarray
hybridizations. while sequence coverage is admittedly smaller on microarrays, data
collected from both encode and promoter arrays have enabled us to define the
importance of the cux <dig> consensus binding site in the recruitment of cux <dig> to genomic
locations and determine whether cux <dig> can regulate genes at a distance.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that p <dig> cux <dig> can mediate transcriptional repression or
activation of specific genes when bound at variable distances from the transcription
start site. although the cux <dig> consensus binding motif, atcrat, plays a role in the
recruitment of cux <dig> to specific genomic sites, protein-protein interactions must
contribute to its transcriptional activity.
