BACKGROUND
eukaryotic chromosomal dna replication initiates from numerous loci, termed replication origins, distributed along each chromosome. the selection of chromosomal sites that will function as origins begins with the binding to dna of the origin recognition complex   <cit> . during late m and early g <dig> phases, orc, together with cdc <dig> and cdt <dig>  directs the loading onto origin dna of mcm complexes to assemble pre-replicative complexes . upon s-phase entry, activation of pre-rcs leads to dna unwinding and the assembly of replisomes that carry out dna synthesis  <cit> . origins differ in their timing of activation during s-phase and their frequency of activation . a clear understanding of factors that influence the efficiency and timing of initiation is lacking, although histone modification, nucleosome positioning, and transcription have been implicated  <cit> . chromatin structure also appears to influence the selection of orc binding sites  <cit> .

in most eukaryotic cells, specific sequences do not appear to be required for orc binding  <cit> . for example, in fission yeast, almost any highly a/t-rich sequence of sufficient length  can function as a replication origin. in xenopus egg extracts and drosophila embryos, apparently random, closely spaced dna sequences serve as replication origins to facilitate rapid cell  division cycles. during embryogenesis, the number of sites used as origins decreases with the onset of transcription. this correlation suggests that the establishment of chromatin domains related to transcription limits the number of orc binding sites in the chromatin. in mammalian cells, transfection of almost any dna fragment of sufficient length can support replication, suggesting that orc binding is generally stochastic but requires the presence of an accessible region in the chromatin. furthermore, the activity of certain sequences as replication origins in mammalian cells correlates with local differences in gene expression in different cell types or lineages  <cit> .

saccharomyces cerevisiae differs somewhat in that specific dna loci that function as replication origins  contain a consensus sequence  that is essential for orc binding and origin function  <cit> . however, an acs alone is not sufficient for origin function and this sequence is much more abundant than the number of orc binding sites or functional replication origins  <cit> . in addition to an acs, arss contain at least one a/t-rich region of dna thought to act as a dna unwinding element. although an unwinding element is important for origin function, it is not required for orc binding  <cit> . thus, despite its sequence preference, it remains unclear exactly how orc binding sites are selected from the many potential sequences; however, local chromatin structures and activities are probably important factors. indeed, the great majority of origins locate to intergenic regions  <cit> . while this and other studies suggest active transcription and origin function are antagonistic  <cit> , the effect of transcription factors on local chromatin can also be important. detailed analysis of ars <dig> suggests that factors that position nucleosomes surrounding origins  influence origin initiation efficiency  <cit> . additional information on the chromatin organization in relation to orc at a variety of origins exhibiting different characteristics  should yield valuable insights into the mechanisms that regulate origin function. a precise mapping of orc binding sites throughout the genome is an important step in this direction.

the advent of dna microarrays has enabled the genome-wide analysis of dna replication dynamics and identification of replication origins in a number of eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, various approaches have been fruitful. some studies have directly analyzed replication timing by monitoring the time at which specific dna sequences double in copy number or incorporate a chemically distinct precursor   <cit> . a very recent study mapped the presence of single-stranded dna during replication, which is expected to identify sites undergoing dna synthesis  <cit> . these types of studies have provided valuable data on the overall dynamics of genome duplication. these studies also identified the positions of ~ <dig> active replication origins, typically to within several kilobases .

an alternative approach to identifying replication origins used genome-wide location analysis to determine the positions of orc and mcm proteins  <cit> . this study identified  <dig> sites predicted to have ars function with a resolution of ~ <dig> kb. this level of resolution facilitated experimental validation of the data set, demonstrating 79% positive predictive value . because this particular study analyzed the position of static protein complexes, it provided a more precise mapping than the timing-based studies, but did not by itself characterize the activity of the predicted sites. thus, the replication dynamics and protein location analyses provide complementary information to help create an accurate description of genome duplication. these studies did not attempt to identify the exact dna sequences  bound by orc, which are essential for origin function. however, one study has identified potential acs using a purely sequence-based search algorithm   <cit> . among the top  <dig> oriscan sites , 56% matched known ars or proars sequences.

to provide a more accurate and complete map of essential origin sequences that bind orc, we performed genome-wide location analysis of orc and mcm2p with a high-density, tiled oligonucleotide microarray. the  <dig> orc and/or mcm2p binding sites revealed potential arss with high accuracy. the resolution of this analysis allowed for precise localization of hundreds of functional acss, which serve as orc binding sites, throughout the genome.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of orc and mcm2p binding sites
previously, we used genome-wide location analysis to map chromosomal binding sites of orc and mcm proteins to about  <dig> kb resolution using dna microarrays  <cit> . these microarrays contained about  <dig>  cdna probes, typically one for each open reading frame  and one for each intergenic region of the s. cerevisiae genome, with an average probe size of  <dig> bp. to map orc and mcm binding sites with greater precision and facilitate the identification of acss within the identified binding regions, we performed genome-wide location analysis of orc and mcm2p using tiled oligonucleotide microarrays  containing one 50mer oligonucleotide to represent each  <dig> bp segment of the genome, in triplicate. dna enriched for orc and mcm2p binding sites was isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation  of orc from m-phase cells and mcm2p from g1-phase cells, respectively. immunoprecipitated and total genomic dna from each sample was differentially labeled and co-hybridized to the arrays.

data were analyzed as outlined in figure 1a . briefly, a two-state hidden markov model  with a mixture of gaussian outputs was used to model the data . this analysis identified  <dig> orc-enriched regions and  <dig> mcm2-enriched regions. the orc and mcm <dig> enriched regions intersect at  <dig> sites. because the orc and mcm <dig> intersecting regions generally do not overlap exactly, the union is used in defining a single site, resulting in  <dig> discrete  regions that we refer to as orc-mcm <dig> sites. the hmm-called regions, a total of  <dig> discrete sites, are divided into three groups:  <dig> orc-only sites,  <dig> mcm2-only sites and  <dig> orc-mcm <dig> sites .

on these tiled oligonucleotide arrays, the immunoprecipitated target dna  is expected to identify numerous probes for each binding site, with the probes' standardized log <dig> signal intensities  forming a peak centered very close to the actual protein binding site. to locate the peak probe more accurately, the z-values were smoothed using a moving average . within each hmm-called region, peaks of orc and/or mcm <dig> signal were identified based on a continuous increase of the smoothed z values  for at least five probes followed by a continuous decrease of sz for at least five probes. a corresponding peak strength was calculated as the average z value  .

ars prediction
we sought criteria to evaluate the merit of the three classes of binding sites for ars prediction. the orc-mcm <dig> class is anticipated to have the strongest predictive value because two different pre-rc proteins co-localize at these sites. thus, we compared characteristics of the orc-only and mcm2-only sites to the orc-mcm <dig> sites. among experimentally verified ars sites, 95% are contained in the hmm-called data set ; of these, 77% are defined by orc-mcm <dig> sites, 23% by mcm2-only sites, and none by orc-only sites. these results suggest that mcm2p binding is a more sensitive predictor of ars location than orc binding.

examination of peak strength shows that true arss are associated with robust signals. for the  <dig> known arss identified in this analysis, 95% of the mcm <dig> peaks and 92% of the orc peaks had avgz â‰¥  <dig> . comparison of signal strength between the three classes of sites shows that, on average, peaks of orc-only sites are significantly weaker than peaks of mcm2-only sites as well as peaks of orc or mcm <dig> in orc-mcm <dig> sites . furthermore, peaks of mcm2-only sites are on average significantly weaker than peaks of orc or mcm <dig> in orc-mcm <dig> sites  . combined with the proportions of known arss associated with each of these classes, these findings suggest that orc-only sites have the lowest, orc-mcm <dig> sites the strongest, and mcm2-only sites an intermediate predictive value.

a bona fide ars is anticipated to contain an acs that serves as the orc binding site. an objective search for a common motif in each group of binding sites using de novo motif finding recovered the acs motif from the orc-mcm <dig> sites . in fact, the recovered motif is very similar to the extended acs  described by theis and newlon  <cit> , and also 89% similar to the motif generated by alignment of  <dig> previously identified, functional acss . for the mcm2-only group, a motif that is 70% similar to the eacs is recovered. no significant motif is recovered from the orc-only sites .  these results further support the idea that orc-mcm <dig> sites are accurate predictors of origins whereas orc-only sites appear to be poor predictors. the mcm2-only group probably contains a greater proportion of non-ars sequences than the orc-mcm <dig> group, complicating identification of the acs motif in this group.

as orc-mcm <dig> sites have a stronger average mcm <dig> peak signal than the average peak signal of the mcm2-only class, a threshold peak signal  was established to select mcm2-only and orc-only regions with a high probability of ars activity. these were included in the set of potential arss called "nimars". in total,  <dig> nimars sites are defined, including  <dig> orc-mcm <dig> sites,  <dig> mcm2-only sites, and two orc-only sites . this data set includes 95% of experimentally confirmed arss . the chromosomal distribution of these sites is shown in figure  <dig> 

validation of ars predictions and comparison with previous studies
our analysis predicted  <dig> nimars loci on chromosomes i and ii. we tested the ars function of  <dig> of these loci , and found that all but two have ars activity . we also tested eight sites on chromosome x that were not predicted in the previous pro-ars data set  <cit> . ars activity was confirmed for six of these sites , one lacked activity, and one resisted analysis. on chromosomes iii and vi, for which ars activity has been comprehensively tested  <cit> , the nimars set predicts five new sites. experimental analysis of these sites showed weak ars activity for three sites, and two lacked activity . comparing the cumulative experimental results from chromosomes i, ii, iii, vi, and x shows 94% ppv of the nimars predictions   <cit> .

comparison of our data with previous array-based origin predictions demonstrates considerable overlap. a venn diagram shows the intersection of four data sets, proars  <cit> , timears  <cit> , ssars  <cit>  and the current nimars . the criterion used to define corresponding sites is overlap between the defined regions. for the  <dig> timearss the region is defined as the  <dig> kb flanking each side of the peak. of these timears regions,  <dig>  intersect with  <dig>  nimars regions. for the  <dig> ssars, the region is defined as the  <dig> kb flanking each side of the average position of ssdna peaks at three time points. for this case,  <dig>  nimars regions intersect with  <dig>  ssars. the high overlap of nimars with both timears and ssars strongly suggests that nimars includes the majority of active arss. among the proars sites,  <dig>  overlap with  <dig>  nimars sites, numbers that closely correspond to the expected number of positives in the proars data set . we tested  <dig> proarss that do not overlap with a nimars site and found that all  <dig> lack ars activity . this finding underscores the greater accuracy of nimars data. also notable is the detection of ars <dig> , ars <dig>  and ars <dig> , three known arss that are inactive as chromosomal origins and have not been previously detected using array methodologies  <cit> . in fact, testing of  <dig> additional sites not identified by any previous array studies shows that 80%  have ars activity, although this activity is frequently weak . the identification of numerous new arss indicates that the current analysis has higher sensitivity than previous studies, and includes some sites that have marginal activity.

orc and mcm2p binding within nimars regions
use of tiled oligonucleotide arrays yielded high-resolution data for which certain characteristics of orc and mcm2p binding in vivo as analyzed by chip could be examined. the mean lengths of individually defined orc and mcm <dig> regions within the set of orc-mcm <dig> sites are not significantly different , suggesting that the orc and mcm complexes associate with similar lengths of chromatin . to assess the relative positions of orc and mcm2p, we compared the distance between the orc and mcm <dig> peaks within the orc-mcm <dig> sites . the peak of the orc or mcm <dig> signal within each binding site is anticipated to identify the oligonucleotide probe closest to the protein-binding site. although there was a significant range to the data, the most common occurrence was co-localization of the orc and mcm <dig> peaks to the same probe, which represents an  <dig> bp region. these data are consistent with orc and mcm proteins occupying similar locations within ars chromatin.

acs identification
peak identification within the hmm-called regions provides a high-resolution map of orc  binding that is expected to correspond to the location of an acs. for the  <dig> acss that have been experimentally verified, orc peaks are found on average  <dig> bp  from the defined acs while mcm <dig> peaks average  <dig> bp  . a signed rank test shows no significant difference between the locations of the two distributions . these distances are significantly shorter than the average shear size of the target dna, suggesting that the shear size does not strictly limit the resolution on the tiling array due to presence of signal peaks in the data. the lack of a closer co-localization is at least partly due to the fact that probes corresponding to the exact acs are frequently missing from the array due to the at richness of these sequences .

the resolution of the nimars data provides an opportunity to precisely define essential acss by narrowing a search to a relatively small region surrounding each nimars data peak. a positional weight matrix  generated from the  <dig> known acss yields a motif containing an eacs as well as three additional positions corresponding to the b <dig> element  . interestingly, two of these three nucleotide positions had been previously mapped as sites of contact with orc at ars <dig>  <cit> , suggesting this interaction is conserved. this eacs+b <dig> pwm was used to search a  <dig> kb window centered on each orc and mcm <dig> peak. a  <dig> kb window was chosen because this roughly corresponds to the 95% confidence interval window for the distance of orc and mcm peaks from known acss . the eacs+b <dig> identified within the nimars set are called nimacs . using a p-value cutoff of  <dig>  Ã— 10- <dig>  we identified  <dig> nimacs in  <dig> nimars .  the percentage of nimars with multiple nimacss is close to the proportion of known arss with multiple functional acss . a three-fold cross-validation  shows that the nimacs includes 58% of known acss . the accuracy of the defined nimacss was tested by mutating  <dig> acss predicted within  <dig> arss on chromosome x . for  <dig> of these arss, mutation of the single predicted acs eliminated ars function. for the remaining three arss in which two acss were predicted in each, one of the two sites was essential for ars function while the other was dispensable. these results indicate a ppv of 82%.

discussion
ars identification in s. cerevisiae by genome-wide motif scanning has been hampered by the abundance of sequences with high similarity to the acs, combined with the level of degeneracy of the acs that supports function. potential solutions to this problem include:  building larger motif models by including other concurrent motifs  <cit>  or compositional information  <cit> ;  assuming a specific motif distribution on chromosomes, e.g., a hidden markov model  <cit> ; and  narrowing down the regions to be searched. the first two methods rely on assumptions, which may introduce significant error. this study took the third approach, using a high-resolution array to map orc and mcm2p binding regions and confining the motif-search to this fraction  of the genome. a very recently published study took a fourth approach, analyzing phylogenetic conservation, in conjunction with motif searching and published microarray data to predict acs locations  <cit> .

we defined  <dig> nimars loci throughout the s. cerevisiae genome that avidly bind orc and/or mcm2p. the vast majority of known arss  are contained in the nimars set and virtually all predicted sites exhibit ars activity when tested . comparison to a recently determined set of chromosomally active replication origins  shows that 83% are contained in the nimars set  <cit> . together, these analyses confirm the high accuracy of the nimars data. the hmm analysis is capable of identifying even weak signals, while the target dna identifies multiple probes on the tiled oligonucleotide array for each binding site, a redundancy that enhances accuracy. we further defined this data set by determining the signal peaks within the nimars regions and constrained the motif search to a  <dig> kb segment centered on each peak. within  <dig>  of the nimars loci we identified at least one nimacs, with an overall ppv of 82%.

approximately one-third of the predicted nimarss are loci where only mcm2p was detected. of the nimarss for which ars activity has been demonstrated , 34%  are mcm2-only sites. this observation suggests that the majority of these sites will prove to possess ars activity. furthermore, orc binding was not detected at 23% of known arss, while nimacss, which predict orc binding, are found at  <dig> of  <dig> of the mcm2-only sites. finally, we have no evidence  suggesting that mcm2-only sites represent a distinct function of mcm2p, which might be independent of orc.

as orc is bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle in budding yeast and is required to "load" the mcm complex onto dna, the detection of many mcm2-only sites suggests that orc is present but recalcitrant to detection by chip, perhaps due to local chromatin differences. indeed, we analyzed orc binding in g2/m-arrested cells because pre-rc assembly is thought to occlude detection of orc in g1-arrested cells  <cit> . however, we have recently found that orc binding at some arss is more strongly detectable by chip during g1- or s-phase . one possibility is that cdc <dig> stabilizes binding of orc to weaker sites during g <dig> to permit mcm loading  <cit> . this would explain the loading of mcm2p in g1-phase at sites where orc failed detection in g2/m, and is consistent with the idea that orc occupancy and stability varies at different sites depending on local chromatin features or dna sequence variation.

whereas orc detection by chip may be context- or cell cycle-dependent, mcm2p seems to be more reliably detected. this may reflect differences in the way the orc and mcm complexes interact with dna. in contrast to models of orc-dna binding along the a rich strand of dna  <cit> , the mcm complex is thought to encircle one or both strands of dna  <cit> . such a topology might enhance cross-linking of mcm to chromatin or otherwise stabilize these complexes for immunoprecipitation. a greater stability of the mcm complex in pre-rcs is supported by in vitro data in which high salt extraction of pre-rcs removes orc  from dna, but not the mcm complex  <cit> .

significantly more pre-rcs are formed than are normally utilized to replicate the genome. this work predicts about  <dig> pre-rcs are formed while other studies indicate that about 260â€“ <dig> of these are primarily responsible for replicating the genome  <cit> . some inefficient pre-rcs retain potential for activation but fail to initiate replication because replication forks emanating from efficient, nearby origins replicate through these sites, thereby eliminating their activation potential   <cit> . however, some sites at which orc and/or mcm2p can be identified exhibit relatively weak initiation potential. in some cases weak initiation is due to local chromatin, such as at the mating-type silencer arss, because these arss function efficiently when removed from their normal chromatin context  <cit> . however, some arss function poorly in the plasmid context, suggesting that sequence variation results in reduced orc binding or inefficient dna unwinding  <cit> . sequence variation explains the failure to identify a robust acs  within about 30% of the nimars. further study will be required to determine how the sequence composition of the acs and the surrounding sequences, as well as the presence of nearby motifs bound by other dna binding proteins, contribute to the differential efficiency of arss .

the molecular evolution of sequence and activity among different orc binding sites  occurs under different selective pressures than that of individual genes or unique sequences with defined functions, as indicated by lower levels of phylogenetic conservation of yeast origins compared to genes  <cit> . this is because most individual orc binding sites likely contribute little or nothing to the organism's fitness. the main requirement is that a sufficient number of efficient origins be distributed along each chromosome to ensure rapid genome duplication. hence, sequence changes that increase the origin efficiency of one orc binding site may reduce selective pressure on orc binding sites on the same chromosome , resulting in weaker binding sites or even sites with specialized function such as the silencers. origin sequence evolution also may derive from selective pressures on local gene functions if these are influenced by the presence of orc. nevertheless, the presence of excess orc binding sites can help ensure efficient genome duplication in case the normal origin initiation program is disrupted  <cit> , and hence, the ability of orc to bind sequence variants is functionally significant. the ability of orc to bind varied dna sequences appears to be particularly important in higher organisms where orc binding appears to conform to differential chromatin contexts related to developmentally regulated gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
a central goal of current research in genomics is a precise and comprehensive mapping of all the protein-protein and protein-dna associations that comprise the chromatin. sequence-specific dna-binding proteins such as orc are thought to play an important role in establishing the local chromatin architecture by influencing the positioning  of histones, which bind dna independently of sequence. conversely, histones and other proteins likely influence orc binding to dna, although the relevant mechanisms remain obscure. in this study we used genome-wide location analysis to identify with high accuracy about  <dig> loci that bind orc and/or mcm2p proteins. within ~70% of these sites we identified dna sequences that match the consensus for orc binding, and confirmed that about 80% were required for ars function. thus, we have defined the exact position of most orc binding sites throughout the genome. these findings represents an important contribution that should facilitate future studies of how the interaction between orc and other chromatin components influences replication origin function, as well as the possibility that orc regulates chromatin structure or nuclear architecture.
