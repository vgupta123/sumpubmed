BACKGROUND
with the recent completion of the perlegen/niehs mouse resequencing  <cit> , over ten million mouse single nucleotide polymorphisms  are now annotated in the public databases, resulting in a dramatic increase in the genome-wide knowledge of variation among  <dig> of the most widely used mouse strains. importantly, this is a lower bound estimate because the c57bl/6j  strain, used for the mouse genome reference sequence , is the only mouse strain sequenced in its entirety. given the proliferation of mouse genetic models  and the recent insurgence of gene expression microarray and phenotypic studies using these mouse models, the impact of naturally-occurring polymorphisms on these data is critical. with the advent of next-generation, high-throughput sequencing , we are now in a position to determine to what extent polymorphisms remain cryptic  in various mouse models and assess their impact on downstream analyses. as an example, we demonstrate that cryptic snps are prevalent, even between two of the most commonly used and well-annotated inbred mouse strains, b <dig> and dba/2j .

the onset of next-generation hts enabled us to obtain full sequence coverage of a region of chromosome  <dig> in the d <dig> and b <dig> mouse strains. there are several platforms for massively parallel dna sequencing currently on the market  <cit> , and we took this opportunity to directly compare the same dataset on two of the three most widely used platforms: illumina  and applied biosystems . the genome analyzer implements a version of cyclic reversible termination chemistry  <cit> , and similarly, the solid platform uses a self-checking ligation chemistry that maps into color space  <cit> . both methods generated short reads that were then realigned to a reference sequence.

the present analyses were limited to a region of chromosome  <dig> from  <dig>  –  <dig>  megabases . this interval was selected for four reasons. first, it is representative of the genome in that it spans discrete regions of high and low snp densities. second, it is a gene dense region containing  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> retrotransposed genes, and  <dig> noncoding rna genes. third, it harbors numerous quantitative trait loci  affecting a wide variety of physiological and behavioral phenotypes . and finally, the low incidence of annotated polymorphisms in a snp-sparse block has hindered high-resolution mapping in this region  <cit> .

we report that comparisons utilizing two well-annotated mouse genetic models, d <dig> and b <dig>  predict that more than half of naturally-occurring snps remain unknown or not annotated. these cryptic snps lead to a high incidence of gene expression microarray false-positive and false-negative results and lead to failures in identifying allelically-variant genes that can underlie qtl phenotypic effects.

RESULTS
d <dig> bac contig and sequence
using  <dig> pcr probes spanning the  <dig>  –  <dig>  mb interval of chromosome  <dig>  we screened a commercially available d <dig> strain bacterial artificial chromosome  library, mm_dba. end-sequencing of the bacs identified by these pcr probes allowed us to assemble a minimal overlapping contig of  <dig> d <dig> bacs . the resulting d <dig> bac contig spanned a total of  <dig>  mb from  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> , <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig> . contig sequence data from the solid and genome anlayzer platforms were assembled via realignment to the ensembl reference sequence  <cit>  and covered the region surveyed without any large gaps.

b <dig> bac contig and sequence
to evaluate our realignment strategy, we sequenced the corresponding region from the b <dig> strain, for which full reference sequence is available  <cit> . we prepared a b <dig> contig based on public end-sequence data for bac clones from the rpci- <dig> library  <cit> . the resulting b <dig> bac contig spanned  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> , <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig> . using both the solid and genome analyzer datasets we attained realignment coverage with the exception of two gaps. the first gap  was expected since the rpci- <dig> bac library map lacks annotated coverage in this region. the second gap  could be due to an error in the mapping of one or two of the rpci- <dig> bacs, since we relied upon reported locations of the b <dig> bac library clones, or, alternatively, could be due to one or two clones missing from our pools. these gaps were present in both assemblies indicating a template problem rather than a sequencing discrepancy.

comparison of applied biosystems and illumina sequence realignments
applied biosytems and illumina each performed realignments of the d <dig> and b <dig> datasets to the public b <dig> reference sequence  <cit> . the solid platform produces short reads  encoded in a color-space format, and applied biosystems used their realignment pipeline specially designed to take advantage of this format for color-space read mapping and downstream analysis including snp detection. the genome analyzer platform produces short read  datasets with bases encoded in the standard letter representations, so illumina carried out a different realignment approach and ran their dataset through the maq  <cit>  pipeline which includes both realignment and snp calling procedures. because both datasets included only short reads, we did not assess potential insertion/deletions.

comparison of our solid and genome analyzer sequence data to the ensembl reference sequence confirmed that the sequence from both platforms is complete. solid generated  <dig>  million reads for the pooled d <dig> bacs, with  <dig>  million  of those mapping to the chromosome  <dig> target interval. solid generated  <dig>  million reads of pooled b <dig> bacs with  <dig>  million  mapping to the chromosome  <dig> interval. genome analyzer generated  <dig>  million d <dig> reads with  <dig>  million  mapping to the chromosome  <dig> interval, and  <dig>  million b <dig> reads with  <dig>  million  mapping to the chromosome  <dig> region. reads that did not align to the chromosome  <dig> interval were mostly bac vector sequence , adapters from sequencing chemistry, and bacterial contamination. these are template specific problems and do not reflect upon differences between the sequencing platforms. additional purification steps would have resulted in fewer unaligned sequences; however, the aligned sequences provided sufficient high read depth coverage, so the exclusion of the unaligned sequences did not adversely affect the present analyses.

deep sequencing was achieved, with average read depths using the genome analyzer of  <dig> and  <dig> for d <dig> and b <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, using solid, for reads aligning to the chromosome  <dig> interval . figure  <dig> illustrates the bac contig composition. each bac was pooled equimolarly and, as expected, we saw higher coverage  in the areas where two or more bacs overlap because more template was included for those regions . we observed differences in the masking of repetitive sequences in applied biosystems vs. illumina realignments, suggesting that repetitive regions are problematic for both platforms with short read sequencing. paired-end sequencing was not performed in the present analyses, but could decipher potential ambiguous, repetitive regions in future analyses.

b <dig> reference sequence quality
although comparison of our custom hts b <dig> data to the b <dig> reference sequence confirmed the high accuracy of the reference sequence , we nonetheless identified a small number of discrepancies in the realignments to the reference sequence. upon assembly, the applied biosystems and illumina realignments of the b <dig> sequence reads differed from the b <dig> reference sequence for  <dig> and  <dig> residues , respectively;  <dig> of these differences were consistent in both datasets when compared to the reference sequence . subsequently, based upon realignment discrepancies called by one or the other platforms, we detected  <dig> provisional realignment discrepancies between our hts and the reference sequence. sequencing on each the solid and genome analyzer platforms was completed independently, with assembly algorithms each requiring a minimal depth of  <dig> reads in order to confirm an allele call. quality of the nucleotide in question, as well as the quality of the surrounding base calls, was taken into account. together, these restraints offer high confidence in the b <dig> allele calls identified by both platforms that differ from the references sequence. overall, this indicates an exceptionally low discrepancy rate  between hts data and the reference sequence and also demonstrates the high quality of the sequence data generated in our analyses. importantly, our custom hts sequence data and the b <dig> reference strain sequence were both from rpci- <dig> b <dig> bacs, which were generated from a pool of five female b <dig> mice from the jackson laboratory. thus, it is extremely unlikely that strain or template inconsistency contributed to the discrepancies in the realignment of our sequence to the b <dig> reference sequence.

results are based upon realignments performed by each vendor for chromosome  <dig> . n's indicate a 'no call' in the realignment. realignment discrepancies to b <dig> reference indicate a mismatch to the reference sequence, and snp detection in d <dig> indicates a different allele than the b <dig> reference sequence. an ambiguous allele indicates that more than one base was called at that base, and since these are inbred animals, those calls are ignored and considered the same as a no call or an 'n'.

snp identification and confirmation
in order to compare the solid and genome analyzer platforms under optimal conditions for each platform and to compare in a manner the majority of end-users are likely to employ, the manufacturers used parameters determined to be optimal for snp calling on their particular platform. the illumina snp calling method  relies upon quality scores and applies a filter based on these qualities, read depth, and neighboring snps in order to discriminate between a snp and a base-calling error. applied biosystems calls snps based on two-base encoding in color-space allowing for more sensitive discrimination between snps and base-calling errors. illumina's method produced fewer no calls  than applied biosystems' method based upon realignments performed by each vendor . no nucleotide bias was apparent in the frequency of the calls using the genome analyzer and solid platforms. we conclude that because of maq's probabilistic approach using qualities, more snps are called by illumina/maq than by applied biosystems; however, it remains to be confirmed if illumina has more false positive calls. it is important to keep in mind that because the vendors used independent mapping and snp calling approaches, differential results due to the platform cannot be distinguished from those due to the analysis pipeline.

currently, the mouse phenome database , which includes dbsnp and perlegen data among other resources, offers the most inclusive snp queries for mouse strains, including comparisons of the d <dig> and b <dig> strains . while, mpd currently annotates  <dig>  d <dig> vs. b <dig> snps in the chromosome  <dig> interval , custom hts identified  <dig>  snps  for the same interval .  <dig>   of the  <dig>  parc snps identified by custom hts were identified using both the applied biosystems and illumina realignments  and are therefore of very high quality .  <dig>   parc snps were identified only by illumina's realignment, and  <dig>  parc snps were identified only by applied biosystems realignment. only  <dig>  of the illumina-specific parc snps and  <dig>  of the applied biosystems-specific parc snps confirmed known snps in mpd.

the solid and genome anlayzer datasets were merged for subsequent comparisons. our results confirmed  <dig>   of the d <dig> vs. b <dig> snps currently annotated in the mpd public dataset within the chromosome  <dig> interval, while  <dig>  of the snps reported in mpd for this interval were determined to be false-positive snps. the  <dig> remaining either lie in gaps in our realignments or had ambiguous  calls in the sequence data. our results identified numerous snps not previously annotated in mpd. in fact, our results identified  <dig>  new snps, more than doubling the number of d <dig> vs. b <dig> snps found in this chromosome  <dig> interval.

this chromosome  <dig> interval spans a clear haplotype break, resulting in a snp sparse region  and a more distal snp dense region  . the snp sparse region contains only  <dig> parc snps based on our custom sequencing, and the snp dense region harbors  <dig>  d <dig> vs. b <dig> parc snps. this data further defines the haplotype break between d <dig> and b <dig> and, importantly, provides additional genetic markers for fine mapping within the snp-sparse region which previously was not possible  <cit> . additionally, full snp annotation will inform future snp array chips allowing for more precise genotyping.

snp impact on protein function or expression
we assessed non-synonymous snps that result in amino acid changes in proteins because of their clear impact on protein activity. based on our custom hts, we found  <dig> missense  parc snps that changed an amino acid residue between the d <dig> and b <dig> strains.  <dig> of these were new missense snps . confirmation experiments  and interrogation of additional datasets  <cit>  already have confirmed  <dig> of the  <dig> new missense snps , with the remaining six lacking additional data. in an effort to determine whether the  <dig> new missense snps affect protein function, we used sift   <cit> , which uses sequence homology to predict whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function, and polyphen   <cit> , which uses multiple sequence alignments and protein 3d structure to predict protein sequence effects on function. based on these two prediction methods, eight of the new missense snps were predicted to affect protein function, although only one of these amino acid changes was predicted to be damaging by both methods . our data also confirmed  <dig> missense snps annotated in mpd. finally, five missense snps in mpd were not confirmed by our data, including three that had full sequence coverage in our data and were determined to have identical d <dig> and b <dig> alleles. our data indicate that these three are false positive missense snps in the public dataset: fcgr2b , fcgr <dig> , itln <dig> . the other two had ambiguous coverage in our alignments and could not be evaluated: fcgr <dig>  and itln <dig> .

chromosome 1
thirty-six of the seventy-six missense parc snps between the d <dig> and b <dig> strains detected by custom hts were not previously annotated in mpd. confirmed snps are defined as those snps detected using two or more independent methods, including the illumina and applied biosystems methods presented here.  <dig> of the  <dig> missense snps have been confirmed by one or more datasets. 1confirmed by both illumina and applied biosystems sequencing pipelines, 2confirmed by transcriptome sequencing , 3confirmed by pcr directed sequencing  <cit> , 4confirmed by realignment of celera raw reads , or 5supported by imputed snps  <cit> . ensembl protein ids and respective amino acid differences are shown with the b <dig> amino acid residue indicated first and the d <dig> residue given last. each amino acid change was assessed using two programs to determine whether or not the amino acid change is predicted to damage protein function. sift uses sequence conservation for predictions and polyphen predicts damaging changes using both multiple sequence alignments  and/or protein 3d structures .

in addition to the new missense snps, we identified  <dig>  new parc snps in non-coding regions. these snps were not previously known or annotated and may regulate gene and/or protein expression. for example, in the kcnj <dig> gene, which demonstrates differential transcript expression between the d <dig> and b <dig> strains  <cit> , we identified  <dig> new snps within  <dig> kb upstream of the transcriptional start site as well as nine new snps in the 3' untranslated region . we also identified one false-positive snp annotated in mpd in the 3' untranslated region. thus, for kcnj <dig> and other differentially expressed genes, elucidation of cryptic snps could identify nucleotide variation that underlies qtl phenotypic effects.

snp impact on gene expression microarrays
naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms dramatically impact hybridization based techniques, including gene expression microarray analyses  <cit> . with the ability to assess alternative transcript expression, exon microarrays have ten times as many probes as previous gene expression microarrays, so eliminating hybridization bias using snp masks is increasingly critical. we have developed and applied a complete snp mask using all of the parc snps found by our custom hts, which allowed us to rigorously assess differential expression between the d <dig> and b <dig> strains. we assessed the impact of  <dig> snps that lie within core probesets on the detection of differential  exon expression for genes in the chromosome  <dig> region of interest using affymetrix mouse exon  <dig>  st array data .  <dig> core probesets interrogate this interval. when compared to our unmasked data, masked results were consistent for  <dig> differentially expressed probesets and  <dig> non-differentially expressed probesets, but indicated  <dig> false positive and  <dig> false negative results due to snps.

furthermore, we overlaid d <dig> vs. b <dig> snps discovered by our custom hts with the probe locations of all four types of probesets within the chromosome  <dig> interval  for the affymetrix exon  <dig>  st gene expression microarray platform. for chromosome  <dig> , there are  <dig> probes and  <dig> probesets on the affymetrix mouse exon  <dig>  st array, and we identified  <dig> probes that spanned at least one snp encompassing  <dig> probesets or 23% of the probesets that interrogate this interval . thus, compared to publicly available d <dig> vs. b <dig> snps, custom hts identified 60% more probesets that span snps.

CONCLUSIONS
we report that comparisons utilizing even two of the most commonly used mouse genetic models, d <dig> and b <dig>  predict that more than half of naturally-occurring snps remain unknown or not annotated. this is particularly striking given that the present comparison is between the b <dig> strain, upon which the mouse reference is based  <cit> , and the d <dig> strain, which is one of the best annotated mouse strains with sequence from celera and extensive snp detection data primarily from perlegen  <cit> . there are approximately  <dig>  million snps currently annotated between the d <dig> and b <dig> strains in mpd  <cit> . thus, cryptic snps would have been even more prevalent had we used more divergent or poorly annotated genetic models.

we compare two methods for next-generation hts. by sequencing the same templates on both applied biosystems' solid and illumina's genome analyzer sequencing platforms, we determined that the platforms offer comparable results at a high read depth. more snps were called by illumina/maq than by applied biosystems, but because the vendors used independent mapping and snp calling approaches, differential results are likely due to differences in the analysis pipelines, as no nucleotide bias in the frequency of the calls made by the genome analyzer and solid was apparent.

mouse models are an invaluable tool for identifying allelic variation that contributes to genetically determined differences in physiology and behavior. however, allelic variation is problematic for follow-up analyses, and removing technical bias resulting from naturally-occurring sequence variation is critical. previously, we illustrated the impact of snps on gene expression microarray analyses  <cit>  and argued that complete snp masks for gene expression microarray and other hybridization techniques are essential to appropriately interpret these data. here, we have taken the next step and sequenced a region of two of the most widely used mouse strains in order to determine the comprehensiveness of snp data. what we have found is that the mouse snp data currently available is incomplete. in fact, for the d <dig> vs. b <dig> strains, we predict that less than half of the true snps are currently annotated. as more divergent mouse strains, harboring even more cryptic snps, are used in studies, the impact of snps on interpreting results will become increasingly problematic. this glimpse at complete sequence data for two strains demonstrates that full genomic sequencing of the mouse strains used as research models is warranted.
