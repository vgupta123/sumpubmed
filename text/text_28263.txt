BACKGROUND
c-myc is a master regulator of essential biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, metabolism, angiogenesis and pluripotency establishment and maintenance  <cit> . c-myc is found overexpressed in most human cancers and is a hallmark of tumor initiation and maintenance  <cit> . characterizing the regulatory mechanisms of c-myc gene expression is therefore fundamental for a better understanding of its deregulation in cancer and to possibly identify novel therapies aiming at controlling its expression. c-myc gene transcription is regulated by multiple transcription factors via responsive elements located within both its promoter and remote enhancer regions . a number of reports, including those from our lab, provided evidence that c-myc expression is regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  . stat <dig> is an essential regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation and survival  <cit>  and is frequently constitutively activated in cancer. stat <dig> constitutive activation results in c-myc overexpression, increased cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis, and is as such an important player in cancer initiation and progression . among molecules that suppress stat <dig> activity, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, of deacetylases and of bromodomain and extra-terminal  proteins represent promising therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination . we and others showed that expression of stat <dig> target genes, including c-myc, is reduced upon treatment with deacetylase inhibitors  or with the bet inhibitor -jq <dig> . further elucidating the process of stat5-induced expression of c-myc and of its inhibition by clinically relevant therapeutic agents is critical for improving cancer therapy.

among the evidence of a direct regulation of c-myc by stat <dig>  an elegant study by lord et al. demonstrated that c-myc expression in response to il- <dig> and il- <dig> is dependent on the transactivation domain of stat <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, c-myc expression is upregulated in cells expressing constitutively active stat <dig>  including in the bcr-abl-transformed human leukemic cell line k <dig> . constitutive activation of stat <dig> by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase bcr-abl contributes to k <dig> cell transformation  <cit> . overexpression of c-myc in k <dig> cells is inhibited by the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib but also by the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a , which we showed to inhibit stat5-mediated transcription  <cit> . in the same line, overexpression of c-myc in ba/f <dig> cells expressing the constitutively active stat <dig> mutant 1* <dig>  <cit>  is repressed by tsa  <cit> . in apparent contradiction with a direct regulation a c-myc by stat <dig>  we found that stat <dig> knock-down in ba/f <dig> cells did not affect il-3-induced c-myc gene expression  <cit> . two other acknowledged direct target genes of stat <dig>  bcl-x and id- <dig> , remained equally unaffected upon stat <dig> knock-down in ba/f <dig> cells  <cit> . although these observations might be interpreted as an indication that these genes are not regulated by stat <dig>  they might also reflect an unconventional mechanism of regulation by stat <dig>  possibly not as sensitive to the partial  knock-down generated upon sirna transfection  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast to most classical stat <dig> target genes  which display stat <dig> responsive elements within their promoter region  <cit> , functional stat <dig> binding sites have been identified outside the promoter regions of bcl-x and id- <dig>  notably within bcl-x first intron  <cit>  and within id- <dig> enhancer located several kb downstream of the id- <dig> gene  <cit> . these observations raise the possibility that regulation of c-myc expression by stat <dig> might be likewise unconventional, possibly involving distal elements. in support of this proposition, we previously attempted and failed to detect stat <dig> binding along the c-myc gene  <cit> , including at gas elements present in its promoter and known to mediate transcriptional response to other stat family members .

recently, several research groups described the role of a 3′ super-enhancer in the regulation of c-myc gene expression in hematopoietic cells and its importance in c-myc overexpression in leukemic cells . c-myc super-enhancer is located  <dig>  mb downstream of the c-myc coding region. it consists of five enhancer regions  with multiple binding sites for transcription factors. these transcription factors recruit transcriptional co-factors, in particular the bet bromodomain protein brd <dig> and the switch/sucrose non-fermentable  protein brg <dig>  these chromatin-associated factors mediate c-myc transcription via long-range chromatin looping and selective interaction with the c-myc promoter . on the other hand, we recently demonstrated that stat <dig> transcriptional activity is regulated by bet proteins, including brd <dig>  <cit> . we found that brd <dig> is recruited along stat <dig> at the proximal promoter and transcription start site of the conventional stat <dig> target gene cis, both upon il-3-induced stat <dig> activation and in cells expressing and transformed by constitutively active stat <dig>  brd <dig> association with the cis gene is lost upon treatment with the bet inhibitor -jq <dig> , resulting in transcriptional inhibition  <cit> . interestingly, deacetylase inhibitors also repress stat5-mediated transcription by displacing brd <dig> and preventing recruitment of the transcriptional machinery  <cit> . our data therefore suggest that stat <dig> recruits brd <dig> which, in turn, supports transcriptional activation by assisting the assembly of the preinitiation complex  <cit> . given that stat5-induced expression of c-myc is also inhibited by jq <dig>  <cit> , and given the absence of stat <dig> binding activity within c-myc promoter and gene locus, we tested the hypothesis that stat <dig> binds to the 3′ super-enhancer and recruits brd <dig> proteins to regulate c-myc gene expression.

RESULTS
c-myc expression is induced by stat <dig> and repressed by inhibitors of deacetylases and of bet proteins in ba/f3-derived cells
this study was conducted in the mouse il-3-dependent pro-b cell line ba/f <dig>  <cit>  and in its transformed il-3-independent counterpart ba/f3-1* <dig>  which expresses the constitutively active mutant stat5a-1* <dig>  <cit> . whereas stat <dig> phosphorylation, binding to dna and transcriptional activity are induced by il- <dig> in ba/f <dig> and ba/f3-wt cells, they are constitutive in ba/f3-1* <dig> cells in the absence of il- <dig> , hence mimicking the situation found in cancer cells. as such, ba/f <dig>  and ba/f3-1* <dig> cells represent ideal experimental models to study and compare stat5-mediated transcription in normal and cancer cells respectively. similarly to that of the stat <dig> target genes cis and osm  <cit> , expression of c-myc was induced by il- <dig> in cells expressing wild-type stat <dig> while it was upregulated in cells expressing the stat5a-1* <dig> mutant in the absence of il- <dig> . in both cell lines, expression of cis, osm and c-myc was inhibited by the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a  , in agreement with our previous reports that deacetylase inhibitors  prevent stat5-mediated transcription  <cit> . likewise, stat5-mediated expression of cis and c-myc in ba/f <dig> cells was inhibited by the bet inhibitor jq <dig> , as already reported  <cit> . expression of the il-3-inducible but stat5-independent gene junb was not inhibited by tsa or jq <dig>  while expression of the housekeeping gene 36b <dig> remained unaffected in all conditions .fig.  <dig>

stat <dig> binds to c-myc super-enhancer
ba/f <dig> and ba/f3-1* <dig> cells were used to investigate transcription factor recruitment along the c-myc gene locus in normal and stat5-transformed cells respectively. chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were conducted in ba/f <dig> and ba/f3-1* <dig> cells using stat5-specific antibodies. immunoprecipitated genomic dna was analysed by quantitative pcr using primers specific for the c-myc gene locus—including known stat binding sites—and for its 3′ super-enhancer . primers specific for regions encompassing the stat <dig> binding sites of the cis and osm genes were investigated as controls . upon il- <dig> stimulation of ba/f <dig> cells, stat <dig> was specifically detected at the stat <dig> binding sites present within the proximal promoter of the cis and osm genes . with the exception of a very weak stat <dig> binding at a previously described stat <dig> binding site within c-myc promoter  <cit> , no stat <dig> binding was detected within the c-myc locus. by contrast, a strong signal was detected specifically at the e <dig> and e <dig> regions of c-myc super-enhancer . interestingly, a similar binding pattern was found in ba/f3-1* <dig> cells , demonstrating that both il-3-induced wild-type stat <dig> and constitutively activated stat5-1* <dig> bind to c-myc super-enhancer elements e <dig> and e <dig>  in support of stat <dig> binding to e <dig> and e <dig>  sequence analysis of the c-myc super-enhancer revealed the presence of clusters of putative stat <dig> binding sites within e <dig> and e <dig>  both consensus  and non-consensus  <cit> , conserved between mouse and human genomes at the same position . no conserved putative stat <dig> binding sites were identified within e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> .fig.  <dig> stat <dig> specifically binds to the e <dig> and e <dig> regions of c-myc super-enhancer. a schematic representation of the mouse stat <dig> target genes cis, osm and c-myc and of the qpcr amplicons analysed following chromatin immunoprecipitation. nucleotide positions are relative to the respective transcription start sites . functional stat binding sites within the individual promoter regions are indicated as grey bars. p <dig> and p <dig> designate c-myc dual promoters, p <dig> being predominant in normal cells. e <dig> to e <dig> symbolise the five domains of c-myc 3′ super-enhancer. black boxes underneath the respective genes represent the qpcr amplicons. primers amplifying regions within cis and c-myc open reading frame  were used as controls. b chromatin immunoprecipitation  was performed with whole-cell lysates from ba/f <dig> cells , either unstimulated or stimulated 30 min with il- <dig>  using antibodies specific for stat5a + stat5b . immunoprecipitated genomic dna  was analysed by qpcr using primers shown in a. one-way anova with dunnett’s post test was used to evaluate il-3-induced stat <dig> enrichment at the various loci compared to the signal detected at the c-myc “orf” region, used as a reference and background control; ***p <  <dig> ; a p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. c chip was conducted with nuclear lysates  from ba/f3-1* <dig> cells grown in the absence of il- <dig>  using antibodies specific for stat5a, which recognize stat5a-1* <dig> mutant. immunoprecipitated gdna was analysed by qpcr, as in b. one-way anova with dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to evaluate stat <dig> enrichment at the various loci vs. c-myc “orf” region, used as a reference and background control; *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>

brd <dig> co-localizes with constitutively active stat <dig> at c-myc super-enhancer
given that brd <dig> is recruited at c-myc super-enhancer in hematopoietic and leukemic cells  <cit> , and since we recently showed the implication of brd <dig> in stat5-mediated transcription in ba/f <dig> and ba/f3-1* <dig> cells  <cit> , we investigated the recruitment of brd <dig> along the c-myc gene and super-enhancer by chromatin immunoprecipitation . in cells expressing stat5a-1* <dig>  brd <dig> bound at e <dig> and e <dig>  but not at e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> of c-myc super-enhancer . unexpectedly, brd <dig> was also detected at the reported stat <dig> binding site within the c-myc promoter. as previously described  <cit> , brd <dig> was found proximate to the transcription start site of the cis gene . brd <dig> binding at cis and c-myc was lost upon treatment with the bet inhibitor jq <dig> , demonstrating brd <dig> binding specificity. interestingly, brd <dig> binding was reduced at cis transcription start site and abolished at c-myc e3/e <dig> upon tsa treatment, but not at the c-myc promoter  location. we previously showed that tsa-induced inhibition of stat <dig> transcriptional activity correlates with brd <dig> loss at the stat <dig> target gene cis  <cit> . we therefore show here that, similarly, brd <dig> binding at e3/e4—but not at stat <dig> element within its promoter—along with stat <dig>  strictly correlates with c-myc transcriptional activation. our data thus strongly suggest that brd <dig> association with c-myc super-enhancer is involved in stat5-mediated transcription of c-myc. the presence of brd <dig> around the stat <dig> binding site and its insensitivity to tsa, suggest that brd <dig> is recruited in a stat5-independent manner to the c-myc promoter, possibly by other transcription factors , and that brd <dig> association at this site is not implicated in stat5-mediated transcription of the c-myc gene.fig.  <dig> brd <dig> co-localizes with stat <dig> at e3/e <dig> in ba/f <dig> cells transformed by constitutive active stat5a-1* <dig>  a ba/f3-1* <dig> cells were treated for 60 min with 200 nm tsa, 1 μm jq <dig> or  <dig>  % dmso . nuclei isolation and chip was performed following the alternative protocol, and using brd2-specific antibodies or the same amount of rabbit igg as a control. qpcr primers are depicted in fig. 2a. only the vehicle-treated igg control is shown. tsa- and jq1-treated igg controls exhibited similar background levels , as previously reported  <cit> . brd <dig> binds strongly to the cis transcription start site , the c-myc promoter region  and enhancer regions e <dig> and e <dig>  brd <dig> association is lost upon jq <dig> treatment and is reduced at cis tss and c-myc e3/e <dig> upon treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor tsa. background cut-off  was defined as the mean of the signal generated by the igg negative controls plus 2x the standard deviation  of the igg control . brd <dig> enrichment at the various loci in the vehicle-treated condition was evaluated using one-way anova with dunnett’s multiple comparison vs. c-myc “orf” region, used as a reference; of note, brd <dig> signal intensity at the c-myc “orf” region is not reduced upon jq <dig> treatment, suggesting that it corresponds to background brd <dig> signal; **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> ; a p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. one-way anova with dunnett’s post test was used to assess differences between tsa- or jq1-treated conditions and the vehicle-treated control; ##

to better characterize the role of stat <dig> in brd <dig> recruitment to stat <dig> target genes, we next addressed whether stat5a-1* <dig> and brd <dig> physically interact. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out on nuclear lysates from formaldehyde-crosslinked ba/f3-1* <dig> cells using stat5a- and brd2-specific antibodies and following the chip protocol . upon immunoprecipitation , samples were analysed by western blot  and quantitative pcr as a control . recruitment efficiency and specificity of stat5a-1* <dig> and brd <dig> to the cis gene was comparable to that observed before . no co-immunoprecipitation of stat5a-1* <dig> and brd <dig> was detected in western blot, following neither stat5a nor brd <dig> ip . it should be noted that, while stat5a was strongly immunoprecipitated under the chip experimental conditions, brd <dig> was poorly pulled-down in the same conditions , probably explaining the weak signals usually detected by qpcr following brd <dig> chip , but also making it difficult to evidence a co-immunoprecipitation with stat5a. the weak immunoprecipitation efficiency observed in brd <dig> chip is likely the consequence of the experimental conditions used . indeed, conventional immunoprecipitation from nuclear lysates of non-crosslinked cells  and using mild buffer conditions resulted in efficient brd <dig> immunoprecipitation . however, no co-immunoprecipitation of stat5a was observed in these conditions. altogether, these experiments suggest that stat5a-1* <dig> and brd <dig> do not directly interact but are rather co-recruited at the chromatin level.

finally, we investigated brd <dig> association with the c-myc gene and its super-enhancer in il-3-stimulated ba/f <dig> cells. while brd <dig> was recruited upon il- <dig> stimulation at the transcription start site of the cis gene, as previously described  <cit> , no brd <dig> enrichment above the igg background was detected along the c-myc gene and downstream enhancer in the same conditions . this observation suggests that, by contrast to stat5a-1* <dig>  il-3-induced wild-type stat <dig> might not be efficient in recruiting and/or stabilizing brd <dig> at c-myc enhancer.

discussion
this study identified functional stat <dig> binding sites possibly regulating c-myc transcription. we showed that stat <dig> specifically binds to enhancer regions e <dig> and e <dig> of c-myc 3′ super-enhancer. putative stat <dig> binding sites within e3/e <dig> are organised in clusters of consensus and non-consensus binding motifs. similar functional stat <dig> binding sites have been described at other stat <dig> target genes  <cit> . binding of wild-type stat <dig> to e3/e <dig> was induced by il- <dig> in normal ba/f <dig> cells while stat5a-1* <dig> binding was constitutive and independent of il- <dig> in transformed ba/f3-1* <dig> cells. interestingly, chip-seq assays performed in human hel leukemia cells revealed that jak2v617f-induced constitutive active stat <dig>  <cit>  is bound at c-myc enhancer region e <dig> , providing another evidence of stat <dig> constitutive binding at c-myc super-enhancer in leukemia cells.

constitutive binding of stat <dig> at e3/e <dig> in ba/f3-1* <dig> cells coincided with that of brd <dig>  suggesting that stat <dig> might play a role in brd <dig> maintenance at c-myc super-enhancer in transformed cells. by contrast, brd <dig> was not detected by chip at the c-myc locus in il-3-stimulated ba/f <dig> cells. we cannot exclude at this point that this absence of specific signal is due to a detection problem. alternatively, it might be the consequence of transient stat <dig> binding in ba/f <dig> cells, as opposed to constitutive stat <dig> binding in ba/f3-1* <dig> cells which might be necessary for brd <dig> maintenance at c-myc super-enhancer. we could not evidence an interaction between stat5a-1* <dig> and brd <dig> in co-immunoprecipitation assays. therefore, our data suggest that constitutive binding of stat5a-1* <dig> at e3/e <dig> might—directly or indirectly—assist and/or stabilize brd <dig> association with c-myc super-enhancer. furthermore, it remains possible that other bet protein are involved in the regulation of c-myc by wild-type stat <dig> in ba/f <dig> cells. this proposition is supported by our previous observation that brd <dig> was detected at the cis but not at the osm promoter in il-3-stimulated ba/f <dig> cells  <cit> . this is also in agreement with the implication of brd <dig> in long-range regulation of c-myc transcription via its 3′ super-enhancer  <cit> . interestingly, it was shown that multiple transcription factors, the bet protein brd <dig> and the swi/snf component brg <dig> are recruited to c-myc 3′ enhancer and contribute to c-myc gene transcription  <cit> . notably, brg <dig> was proposed to maintain transcription factor occupancy at the enhancer region and to facilitate interactions with the c-myc promoter  <cit> . whether such a mechanism of stabilisation by brg <dig> also takes place in stat5-mediated transcription remains to be shown. maintenance of stat <dig> occupancy at c-myc super-enhancer would be an attractive explanation for the absence of effect of stat <dig>  knock-down on c-myc gene expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that constitutive binding of stat <dig> and maintenance of brd <dig> at e3/e <dig> in transformed ba/f3-1* <dig> cells correlated with transcriptional activation of c-myc. furthermore, brd <dig> binding at e3/e <dig> was lost upon tsa- and jq1-mediated inhibition of c-myc expression, both of which inhibit stat5-induced transcription  <cit> . our data therefore suggest that constitutive binding of stat5a-1* <dig> contributes to brd <dig> maintenance at c-myc super-enhancer in transformed ba/f3-1* <dig> cells, which in turn might be implicated in c-myc overexpression. in support of a role of stat <dig> in c-myc overexpression in leukemia via c-myc super-enhancer, e <dig> was recently shown to display enhancer activity in k <dig> leukemia cells, using a luciferase reporter assay  <cit> . this finding nicely fits with our previous finding that c-myc expression in k <dig> cells is dependent on bcr-abl-induced constitutive active stat <dig>  <cit> . our model is hence in line with the recently suggested leukemia maintenance function attributed to c-myc 3′ super-enhancer, via the recruitment of bet proteins by hematopoietic transcription factors  <cit> . we propose that the transcription factor stat <dig> might play a similar role in c-myc overexpression, in leukemia exhibiting constitutive stat <dig> activation. further functional assays will be necessary to verify this proposition.
