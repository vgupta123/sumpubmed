BACKGROUND
genetic activity of interphase chromosomes is intimately linked to the properties of chromatin organization. at a very basal level, chromatin is organized in nucleosomes, histone octamere/dna complexes. these, in turn, form higher-order structures, such as chromomeres, loops, domains, etc. clearly, key to this organization are the chromatin proteins: histones, their post-translational modifications, and non-histone proteins. modern methods help reliably address the question of interphase chromatin organization at a nucleosomal level, however details of higher-order chromatin organization still remain obscure. this is largely due to our inability to directly visualize the supra-nucleosomal structures in diploid interphase nuclei. giant polytene chromosomes from dipterans, in particular from drosophila, allow one to mitigate this problem.

"classic" polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands of d. melanogaster are composed of bundles of one to two thousand tightly synapsed chromosomal strands, which are formed via multiple rounds of endoreplication of just two starting chromatids. as all the homologous chromomeres from all chromatids are aligned to each other, this results in the formation of a thick "cable" with transverse stripes of compacted chromatin  alternating with decompacted interchromomeric regions . local differences in size and compaction of banded material form a unique banding pattern that can be used to accurately map any polytene chromosome region. this in turn allows one to link a particular dna sequence, genes and proteins to the specific chromosomal region, and so to spatially analyze the genetic processes taking place in the interphase nucleus .

according to different estimates, there are 3500- <dig> bands and interbands in drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes; these comprise about 95% and 5% of euchromatic dna, respectively. on average this corresponds to  <dig> kb of genomic material per band and  <dig> kb per interband  <cit> . obviously, the vast majority of genes are situated in bands, as they encompass most of the dna. as a rule, the degree of chromatin compaction in bands correlates with their transcriptional activity. this is manifested most clearly in case of puffing, i.e. when upon gene activation bands form puffs. despite the fact that interbands are also represented by decompacted chromatin, their genetic organization and functions are still largely enigmatic. several hypotheses regarding the functions of interbands were put forward in the literature , but can be essentially reduced to just two alternatives. namely, the interbands correspond to active genes. or, interbands harbor regulatory regions for genes that are found in the neighboring bands. neither of these scenarios had been adequately addressed experimentally.

in light microscope, many decompacted regions appear as interbands, however upon closer examination at an em-level they in fact comprise series of faint bands. thus, of the regions typically considered interband-like, only some are true interbands. presently it is well-known that numerous "open chromatin" proteins are typically found in such decompacted regions. for instance, these are different forms of rna polymerase ii  <cit> , including the paused rna polymerase ii  <cit>  which is necessary for transcription initiation; these are proteins and protein complexes involved in transcriptional elongation: spt <dig>  spt <dig>  spt <dig>  tfiih, dmediator, dell  <cit> . likewise, these regions frequently contain nucleosome remodeling and histone-modifying proteins: chd <dig>  <cit> , jil- <dig>  <cit> , brm  <cit> , cohesin  <cit> , trx  <cit> , wds  <cit> , h2b monoubiquitinating enzyme bre <dig>  <cit> , and nurf, which increases accessibility of chromatin templates  <cit> ; they harbor histone variants: h4k16ac  <cit> , h3k9ac, h3k14ac  <cit> , h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, insulator proteins beaf- <dig>  <cit>  and gaf  <cit>  as well as pre-replication complex protein orc <dig>  <cit>  are also found in many decompacted regions of polytene chromosomes. finally, there are at least two interband-specific and interacting proteins, z <dig> and chriz , however their functions in interbands are presently unknown  <cit> .

despite this plethora of interesting chromatin proteins linked to interbands, their very cytological mapping is not accurate enough, as it is quite challenging to reliably map the protein localization signal to a fine structure of an interband, at least at the resolution level of light microscopy.

clearly, in order to address the functions of interbands, it is important to be able to accurately map interband regions on a physical map and then to analyze the protein binding profiles and chromatin features in these regions. unfortunately, using standard mapping techniques, it is close to impossible to precisely map dna sequences to interbands as their axial lengths are quite small   <cit> . to solve this problem, one must develop new approaches to mark and identify interband regions. p-element insertions could serve as such useful "markers". using electron microscopy  analysis of polytene chromosomes from stocks with p-element-based insertions, our group has previously shown that such insertions can be visualized on polytene chromosomes as distinct cytological structures  <cit> . in most cases, transcriptionally silent chromatin in such transgenes becomes compacted and forms novel bands, provided that insertions occurred into interbands. when inserted into bands, the compacted material from a transgene typically fuses with the neighboring material and does not form a separate band . as the transgene sequence is known, cloning the dna sequence adjacent to the transgene insertion is straightforward, and so one can unambiguously identify the sequences that belong to interbands  <cit> .

using this approach, we mapped and cloned the dna from  <dig> interband regions. we found that these interbands were mainly composed of non-coding intergenic regions and 5'-utrs. also, many of the interbands were rich in dnase i hypersensitive sites , which turned out to behave as "hot spots" for integration of p-element based transgenes  <cit> .

with these observations in hands, we decided to further explore the question of functional organization of interbands. first of all, we wanted to establish which proteins were specific to the interbands' open chromatin, and then to ask whether localization of some of these proteins could be correlated on a genome-wide scale. obviously it was of utmost importance also to understand whether the interbands from polytene chromosomes were "mirrored" by analogous regions in chromosomes from cell lines. also, in order to address the question of existence of a defined molecular border between bands and interbands, it was interesting and necessary to estimate the length of dna sequences associated with such proteins. to tackle all these questions, we analyzed the data from drosophila genome-wide protein mapping databases, mostly those from nhgri modencode project  <cit>  and from filion with co-authors  <cit> . these projects included comprehensive genome-wide analysis of a wide array of chromatin proteins and histone modifications from d. melanogaster cell lines. as a result,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> and even  <dig>  <cit>  distinct chromatin types were identified, which were characterized by specific combinations of classes of genes and associated proteins.

using the abovementioned data obtained on interphase chromosomes of cell lines, in the present work we performed comparative analysis of thirteen interband regions from polytene chromosomes searching for the proteins specifically enriched in interbands. vast majority of interbands studied was found to associate with a set of proteins that is typically found in open chromatin. these open chromatin proteins tended to localize to low nucleosome density and histone h1-depleted regions and to correlate with binding of orc <dig>  a pre-replication complex protein. our data suggest that regions possessing most of these features combined are typically smaller than 3- <dig> kb in length, and that the number of such regions closely matches the estimated number of cytologically distinct interbands in polytene chromosomes. furthermore, our data demonstrate that interband chromatin is similarly organized in different cell types, thereby suggesting its participation in general processes that serve to form and maintain the functional architecture of interphase chromosomes.

RESULTS
open chromatin proteins and histone marks are found in the cell line chromosome regions that correspond to polytene chromosome interbands
distribution profiles for several dozens of proteins and histone marks in several d. melanogaster cell types have been established through the efforts of modencode project  <cit> . we used these data and other chromatin features and focused on the regions that correspond to  <dig> previously mapped interband regions from polytene chromosomes  <cit> . specifically, we used modencode chip-chip datasets for s <dig> cells and in some instances kc <dig> cells, which were generated for  <dig> histone modifications and  <dig> chromatin proteins belonging to different functional classes. notably, band/interband transition points remain presently unknown, and interband size estimates also vary quite widely from  <dig>  to over  <dig>  kb  <cit> . thus, we compared binding profiles for these proteins over  <dig> kb regions centered around insertion sites of reference transgenes which were mapped to the interbands studied and used to clone respective dna sequences . figure  <dig> illustrates that in cell lines most of the  <dig> regions analyzed  associate with open chromatin proteins. notably, most of these proteins show significantly lower levels of the distribution in control sets of random dna sequences of equal size from the d. melanogaster genome or from three large molecularly mapped bands 10a1- <dig>  75c <dig> and 75c <dig>   <cit> . of these open chromatin proteins, rna polymerase ii, chriz, orc <dig>  gaf, beaf- <dig>  cp <dig>  trx, as well as h3k9ac, h4k16ac and h3k4me <dig> were previously reported to partially or completely immunolocalize to interbands . the rest of the proteins - wds, dmi- <dig>  nurf <dig>  bre <dig>  h3k4me2/ <dig> and h4k16ac were known to contribute to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. we failed to observe h3k4me3-lp and tetra-h4ac in interband regions, even though these histone marks were reported as present in transcriptionally active chromatin  and h3k4me3-lp  show overall very similar distribution profiles , the latter antibody rarely displays enrichment above the significance threshold defined by modencode.

another peculiar feature of the regions studied is that they very frequently  encompass h1-dips  - the regions depleted for histone h <dig>  <cit> . this linker histone is known to be the key protein in compacting the  <dig> nm chromatin fiber into  <dig> nm super-beaded form  <cit> . therefore, presence of h1-dips can be considered as a marker of open chromatin. it is interesting to note that the trends observed for proteins and histone marks associated with open chromatin over  <dig> kb were essentially the same even over  <dig> kb centered at insertion points of reference transgenes . this might point to the possible functional interactions of said proteins in these regions of the genome. we next observed that 50-70% of the regions analyzed were also associated with hp1c, hp1b, jil- <dig>  dring, h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  finally, in the regions that correspond to interbands, in cell lines there was no or very little binding for typical "closed chromatin"  proteins such as hp1a, pc, hp2b, mod, su, e, su3- <dig>  su3- <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k23ac .

we then analyzed in more detail the profiles for each of the chromatin proteins and histone marks, for p-element insertions and for nucleosome-depleted regions within ±  <dig> kb from insertion sites of reference transgenes in  <dig> interband regions. dna sequences encompassing  <dig> - <dig> kb around these sites were considerably enriched in many open chromatin proteins, such as rna polymerase ii, chriz, orc <dig>  gaf, beaf- <dig>  cp <dig>  trx, wds, dmi- <dig>  nurf <dig> and bre <dig>  furthermore, these same regions tended to display lower nucleosome density and served as hot spots for p-element integrations . of the histone marks that are characteristic of active chromatin, the following five were most frequently  and widely  found: h3k4me <dig>  h4k8ac, h3k9ac, h3k4me <dig> and h4k16ac. in contrast to non-histone proteins found in active chromatin, the distribution of "active" histone marks is somewhat wider, with slight increase towards the edges of the sequences analyzed . as it was mentioned above, in the interband regions studied, the enrichment for "inactive" marks is close to negligible; hence we failed to identify any peculiar features in their localization.

overall, the data presented here argue in favor of apparent protein-wise similarity in chromatin organization of  <dig> "true" interband regions studied in polytene chromosomes and of the corresponding regions of genome in cell lines.

genome-wide analysis of proteins found in interband regions
to uncover the genome-wide localization characteristics for proteins that map to selected interband regions, we used geo  datasets available as gff-files at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds. these files describe genomic regions significantly bound by most of the proteins assayed by modencode. we selected fragments with positive scores for non-histone proteins and h1-dips  for all drosophila chromosomes and estimated their genome-wide distributions and lengths of the fragments. large fraction  of these fragments, bound by either "active" or "silent" chromatin proteins, was  <dig> to  <dig> kb long . the number of fragments bound by "active" chromatin proteins, - rna polii, chriz, wds, orc <dig>  h1-dips, gaf, cp <dig>  beaf- <dig>  dmi- <dig>  nurf <dig>  bre <dig>  trx, -and ranging 1- <dig> kb, is 3000- <dig> , which roughly corresponds to the observed number of interbands in polytene chromosomes  <cit> . on the contrary, there are far fewer fragments  that are of similar size  and are associated with "silent" chromatin proteins pc, e, dring, or with typical insulator components: ctcf mod, su .

in order to estimate how frequently these proteins co-localize in d. melanogaster genome, we performed their pair-wise comparison. the number of overlapping pairs was considered as a similarity measure for every pair of factors being compared. only the fragments that showed positive scores and which were smaller than  <dig> kb were considered. we calculated the number of unique paired overlaps between the fragments  and so estimated the pair-wise correlation coefficients between the proteins . the highest values of correlation coefficients were observed for the "active" chromatin proteins and for proteins enriched in  <dig> interbands, i.e. for beaf- <dig>  chriz, rna pol ii, orc <dig>  h1-dips, trx, wds, nurf <dig> and bre <dig>  the same was observed for "silent" chromatin group of proteins - mod, su, e, dring. to verify whether this co-localization is significant, we first fragmented the euchromatic part of the genome  into non-overlapping  <dig> kb-long blocks ). then we analyzed each of these ~ <dig> blocks for the presence of all pair-wise combinations of these proteins. as it is shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  the probability of independent pair-wise localization of all "active" proteins in interbands studied is fairly low . figure 5a shows a multidimensional scaling plot  of the correlations mentioned above. the "active" chromatin proteins characteristic of interbands cluster together and away from the cluster of "silent" chromatin proteins that do not map to interbands.

using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering  approach, we estimated the co-localization frequencies for all the proteins. these formed  <dig> separate groups . first group comprised the "active" chromatin factors, such as beaf- <dig>  chriz, h1-dips, rna polii, orc <dig>  trx and wds, many of which were reported to immunolocalize to decompacted regions of polytene chromosomes. it is interesting to note that the numbers of pair-wise overlaps for the proteins from this group are fairly tight, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , which fits very well the number of interbands in polytene chromosomes  <cit> . nucleosome remodeling proteins such as nurf <dig>  dmi- <dig> and gaf also tend to co-localize with this group. the two remaining groups of proteins are represented mainly by pc-g proteins - pc, e, dring and by insulator proteins, mod, su, ctcf, cp <dig>  and surprisingly by bre <dig>  these proteins display low levels of co-localization frequency with the proteins from the first group, and so appear not to be present in interbands.

discussion
using genome-wide distribution data for a wide range of non-histone proteins and histone marks available for d. melanogaster cell lines  <cit> , we analyzed the protein composition and chromatin features in genomic regions of cell line chromosomes corresponding to  <dig> interband regions of polytene chromosomes. our results establish these regions as depleted for the linker histone h <dig> , and associated with a specific set of proteins characteristic of "active" chromatin . this is also consistent with the distribution of different states of chromatin in these genomic regions . namely of the five principle states of chromatin that were previously identified in drosophila cell lines and color-coded by filion with co-authors  <cit> , it is predominantly red chromatin that we observe most frequently within  <dig> kb fragments encompassing interbands. this chromatin is reported as enriched in orc binding sites as well as in regulatory sequences and mainly comprises genes which are linked to specific processes such as "receptor binding", "defense response", "transcription factor activity" and "signal transduction"  <cit> . the interband regions studied also contain yellow and blue chromatin . transcriptionally active yellow chromatin is specifically marked with h3k36me <dig>  a mark of transcriptional elongation typically present on genes with a broad expression pattern over many developmental stages and tissues, so-called "house-keeping" genes. blue chromatin is mostly found in genome regions associated with pc-g proteins and harboring developmental genes as well as many of the highly conserved non-coding elements  that contribute to gene regulation  <cit> . it is important to emphasize that the fraction of red chromatin relatively to the rest of the chromatin types increases closer to the insertion sites marking interband regions . at a  <dig> kb level, red chromatin is  <dig>  and  <dig>  times enriched compared to the yellow and blue states, respectively, whereas when the regions ±  <dig> kb around insertion sites are considered, red chromatin is  <dig>  time more frequent. green and black chromatin states characteristic of genetically silent material  are very rarely found in interbands and if present tend to be located on the flanks .

according to the 9-state model of chromatin organization in cell lines  <cit> , the regions corresponding to interbands are mostly composed of state  <dig> and state  <dig> chromatin . state  <dig> chromatin is rich in promoters, tsses and 5'-utrs. state  <dig> chromatin is mainly characterized by the presence of large first introns in long genes, enrichment for specific chromatin remodeling factors , presence of enhancers and early origins of replication. as compared to states  <dig> and  <dig>  state  <dig> domains show stronger enrichment for transcription-associated histone variant h <dig>   <cit> . despite some differences in approaches as well as in the proteins analyzed in  <cit> , the regions that correspond to  <dig> interbands display consistent set of features. they are mostly represented by regulatory and promoter regions for the genes which appear to reside in the adjacent compacted material of bands .

most of the "active" chromatin proteins that mapped in cell lines to dna regions corresponding to interbands, are known to immunolocalize to interbands . therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the "open" chromatin feature and the localization of a specific set of proteins are inter-related, and in fact represent a universal principle of interphase chromosome organization. this conclusion is consistent with the highly detailed observations by w. beermann, who compared banding patterns in four larval tissues of chironomus, and who observed them to match perfectly except for minor differences at certain regions and differences due to puffing  <cit> . similar work on drosophila also described very minor changes in banding pattern  <cit> . significant similarity in banding patterns was subsequently observed upon comparison of many different tissues from many insects . that "active" chromatin is invariably present in interbands, is also supported by the similar pattern of dhss in salivary gland polytene chromosomes and in embryonic cells. for instance, mapping of major dhss on physical and cytological maps of the faswb interband demonstrated their identical localization, length and number in the chromatin of embryonic cells, cell lines  <cit>  and in larval cells  <cit> . this might help to explain high frequency of p-element integrations into interbands, as insertions tend to hit the regions of dhss  <cit> . it must be emphasized that p elements transpose and integrate in diploid germline cells, and there are no reasons to believe that insertions sites are linked in any way to the gene expression nearby  <cit> . within reference interbands, we observed p-elements to predominantly cluster around open chromatin regions , therefore this might suggest that these same dna sequences are also organized in open chromatin in germline cells, where p-elements actually transpose and integrate.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the genome-wide protein mapping data generated by modencode on d. melanogaster cell lines, and using previously mapped interband regions as a reference, we for the first time demonstrated that decompacted chromatin regions that appear as interbands in polytene chromosomes are organized the same way in other cell types and correspond to interchromomeres of interphase chromosomes in cell lines. the peculiarities of protein distribution identified for interband regions can serve as convenient markers to precisely map interbands to the molecular map, thereby allowing one to compile comparative molecular and cytogenetic maps of interphase chromosomes in different drosophila cell types. indeed, further experimental validation of band and interband regions on a larger scale should be helpful to firmly establish this conclusion. using our approach, precise mapping of the band/interband positions across entire drosophila genome is a subject of separate work which is currently underway.
