BACKGROUND
peroxisomes are single-membrane bound organelles found ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells. they house more than  <dig> matrix enzymes that participate in a diverse array of metabolic processes including the β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids  and α-oxidation of long branched-chain fatty acids  <cit> . peroxisomes also contain oxidases that produce the corrosive byproduct hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . h2o <dig> and other dangerous reactive oxygen species  are then converted to innocuous products such as water and molecular oxygen by catalase and other enzymes within the peroxisome and in other cellular compartments  <cit> . because of their complex roles in both cellular metabolism and ros elimination, peroxisome function is strongly related to cellular development and eventual cellular senescence when their functionality begins to fail.

while cellular aging and senescence are well characterized by peroxisomal dysfunction  <cit> , little is known about the origin of these organelles, particularly during embryonic development. important players in the regulation of overall peroxisome numbers are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors , which were first identified in the early 90s in mice  <cit> . three types of ppars have been identified  that function as transcription factors and play critical physiological roles as lipid sensors and regulators of lipid metabolism, as well in the regulation peroxisome numbers  <cit> . total peroxisome numbers, and as importantly, peroxisome biogenesis, involves the production of proteins termed peroxins; nuclear encoded by pex genes, synthesized on free polyribosomes in the cytosol and post-translationally transported into the peroxisomal matrix and membrane  <cit> . peroxins can facilitate peroxisomal membrane function, biogenesis and division, and the transport of specific cytosolic proteins into the peroxisomal matrix via one of two peroxisomal targeting signals   <cit> . the pts <dig> signal sequence is a complex amino terminal signal composed of n/k-l-x5-q-h/l, while the pts <dig> consists of the c-terminal amino acid sequence skl and a conserved variant form, kanl  <cit> . studies have shown proteins with the skl signal have a higher affinity for peroxisomes than proteins with the relatively weaker kanl signal  <cit> . in addition to providing functionality within peroxisomes, these cytoplasm-to-peroxisome protein import pathways have been proposed as a necessary mechanism to increase peroxisome numbers from existing peroxisomes  <cit> . while peroxisome number may be augmented though signal transduction  <cit> , the total number of peroxisomes in a cell is regulated by;  peroxisome de novo biogenesis,  peroxisome proliferation by division and  peroxisome degradation by pexophagy, an autophagy-related process  <cit> .

multiple studies on pex <dig> proteins have contributed to understanding their role in peroxisome division, although the specific molecular mechanisms that regulate their function are poorly understood  <cit> . expression levels of pex <dig> peroxins are directly correlated with peroxisome numbers  <cit> . for example, a pex11p knock-down in yeast significantly reduced the amount of cellular peroxisomes, whereas, pex11p overexpression increase their numbers  <cit> . a similar ability to promote peroxisome proliferation was also reported in humans  <cit> , rodents and protozoan models  <cit> . all of these studies support a direct role for the pex11-family in peroxisome division in vitro, though little is known about their role during embryogenesis.

it is unknown whether peroxisomes exist in fertilized eggs, or in early stage vertebrate embryos. while early frog development requires glycogen and lipid reserves to be oxidized, and protein and yolk reserves to be metabolized, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of yolk, vitellogenin and lipid metabolism in oviparous animals such as frogs. early histological staining studies revealed that yolk and lipid utilization follow gastrulation, but preceded cell differentiation. selman and pawsey revealed that frog yolk and lipid utilization took place ventral to the archenteron just prior to stage  <dig>  and within the developing myotomes by stage  <dig>  <cit> . other histochemical studies have also shown that yolk and lipid metabolism occurs within the somites as they begin to differentiate between stages 17- <dig>  <cit> . yolk is then metabolized in most differentiating tissues in the embryo after stage  <dig>  <cit> . this tissue specific utilization of yolk has been more recently confirmed using a variety of approaches including the examination of ph changes, and the involvement of proteases such as cathepsin d, and inhibitors such as ep45/pnixa/seryp  <cit> . this tissue specific regulation of yolk metabolism during embryogenesis suggests complex underlying developmental controls of these processes.

while peroxisomes are needed for metabolism and ros regulation, their origins and biogenesis within the embryo are poorly understood. here we examine the level of expression of peroxisomal genes pex <dig>  pex <dig>  pex <dig>  pex11β, catalase and pmp <dig>  as well as pparα, δ, and γ in a x. laevis cell line, and during embryonic development. we test the hypothesis that pex11β has the ability to induce peroxisomal gene expression in vitro, and induce early increase in peroxisome number in vivo. our results demonstrate that overexpression of pex11β can increase the number of peroxisomes in xenopus a <dig> cells in vitro, and induce an early-onset to peroxisome-like structures during xenopus embryogenesis in vivo. we propose that pex11β plays a direct role in peroxisome divisions, and additionally, regulating the timing of peroxisome biogenesis during x. laevis embryonic development.

RESULTS
pex11β altered the rna levels of peroxisome related genes in x. laevis a <dig> cells
we first investigated if pex11β could alter the rna levels of the peroxisome related genes pex <dig>  pex <dig>  pex <dig>  pex11β, catalase, pmp <dig>  pparα, -δ, and -γ in x. laevis a <dig> kidney epithelial cells, something that has not been demonstrated in xenopus before. a <dig> cells were transfected with plasmids designed to express xenopus ha-pex11β, or control full-length gfp. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses revealed a significant increase in pex11β, pmp <dig>  catalase, pex <dig> and pparα, but a significant decrease in pparγ mrna levels, following ha-pex11β overexpression in a <dig> cells . no significant changes were found in levels of pex <dig>  pex <dig>  nor in ppar δ mrna .

pex11β increased hallmark peroxisomal protein levels in x. laevis a <dig> cells
since overexpression of ha-pex11β increased the mrna levels of catalase and pmp <dig>  we next wanted to determine if there were actual increases in the protein levels of these hallmark peroxisomal proteins. a <dig> cells were transfected as previously described and protein samples were isolated for western blots. using a specific ha antibody, western blot analysis confirmed bands of expected sizes for ha-pex11β  in transfected samples , confirming the integrity of the ha-tagged construct. western blot analyses with catalase and pmp <dig> specific antibodies also revealed bands of expected sizes for both pmp <dig>  and catalase  . a significant increase in catalase and in pmp <dig> were found following ha-pex11β overexpression versus control untransfected samples . the use of anti-β-actin demonstrated the relative protein levels in each lane.

overexpression of pex11β increased peroxisome numbers in x. laevis a <dig> cells
although recent studies in several eukaryotic cell lines have revealed that pex11-proteins can independently increase peroxisome-like structures  <cit> , we tested the hypothesis that pex11β could induce an early onset to peroxisome biogenesis during xenopus embryogenesis. however, we first tested whether overexpression of pex11β could increase peroxisome-like structures and peroxisome number in x. laevis a <dig> cells. two days following transfection of ha-pex11β, cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry and probed with pmp <dig> and catalase antibodies. this allowed us to examine the distribution of pmp <dig> and catalase protein, and also to quantify their relative protein levels using a fluorescent secondary antibody. our results indicated that overexpression of ha-pex11β significantly increased the amounts of both catalase levels  and pmp <dig> levels  versus control, as determined by quantifying the relative levels of indirect fluorescent; catalase indirect fluorescence levels increased > <dig> fold , while pmp <dig> indirect fluorescence levels increased > <dig>  fold .

as the increased levels of pmp <dig> and catalase fluorescent signals may not specifically be related to peroxisome function, we next tested if overexpression of ha-pex11β could also increase the number of peroxisomes using the peroxisomal marker gfp-skl as a detection assay. this pts <dig> tagged gfp will localize to punctate-like structures in the cytosol when imported into peroxisomes. a <dig> cells were co-transfected with ha-pex11β and gfp-skl, or gfp-skl alone. two days following transfection, peroxisome-like structures were assessed by direct immunofluorescence. our results showed a significant increase in the number gfp-containing bodies  in cells that expressed ha-pex11β versus cells transfected with gfp-skl alone .

pex11β increased peroxisome related gene expression during x. laevis embryogenesis
we next examined the effects of increased pex11β in vivo, by investigating changes in expression of specific peroxisomal genes, following the microinjection ha-pex11β rna into early xenopus embryos. to establish a foundation, the temporal expression of five peroxisomal genes was first analyzed during the developmental stages of gastrulation , neural tube closure  and organogenesis . in general, with the exception of pex <dig>  all peroxisomal genes examined in control embryos increased in expression as development progressed, with their lowest expression levels at stage  <dig>  and highest at stage  <dig> . pex <dig> expression in control embryos does not alter significantly between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the increase in pmp <dig> rna level between stages  <dig> and  <dig> differs from that a previously described decreasing trend between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this difference could be due to the examination of different stages , though in both cases the more important trend of increasing levels towards stage  <dig> and beyond is the same. following microinjection of ha-pex11β rna there were significantly increased rna levels of catalase and pmp <dig> at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  versus control rna levels of expression for each gene. microinjecting ha-pex11β also resulted in significant increases of pex <dig> at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as pex <dig> at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  there were no significant changes in pex <dig> at stage  <dig>  nor pex <dig> at stage  <dig>  changes in pex11β levels following microinjection of ha-pex11β reflect the presence of the ha-pex11β construct.

further, as ectopic pex11β significantly decreased pparγ rna levels in a <dig> cells, we investigated whether ectopic pex11β would similarly alter ppar levels within embryos. the injection of pex11β into embryos significantly increased levels of pparα, significantly decreased levels of pparγ, but did not change levels of pparδ rna , a pattern similar to that seen in the a <dig> cells.

catalase and pmp <dig> antibodies reveal early punctate organelle structures during x. laevis embryogenesis following pex11β injections
to determine if pex11β could induce an early onset to peroxisome-like structures during xenopus development, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize changes in the embryonic distribution of pmp <dig> and catalase, in response to microinjecting ha-pex11β rna. fertilized embryos were microinjected with ha-pex11β rna, fixed at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  and sectioned for immunohistochemistry. pmp <dig> and catalase signals were undetected in stage  <dig> under control conditions  using specific antibodies. punctate structures were visualized within the somites at stage  <dig> in control sections, using pmp <dig> , and catalase  specific antibodies. following microinjection of ha-pex11β, we were able to detected punctate pmp <dig>  and catalase  signals at stage  <dig> in pre-somitic mesoderm, and increased levels of immunofluorescence for both proteins in stage  <dig> somites compared to control uninjected embryos .


overexpression of pex11β triggered an early-onset to peroxisome accumulation during xenopus embryogenesis
in order to determine when peroxisomes are first present during embryonic development, focusing on the dorsal mesoderm, we microinjected gfp-skl into early-fertilized embryos. histological sections taken of developmental stage  <dig> embryos revealed that peroxisomes were not visible, as gfp-skl revealed a diffuse staining pattern that lacked punctate structures , similar to that seen in control gfp injections embryos . however, gfp-containing punctate bodies, indicative of peroxisomes, are readily visible in control embryos at stage  <dig> in the somites .


next, we wanted to determine if overexpression of pex11β could induce an accumulation of peroxisomes, similar to how overexpression in a <dig> cells increased peroxisome numbers. histological sections showed that ectopic expression of ha-pex11β in embryos resulted in the presence of punctate gfp-containing bodies at stage  <dig> , versus the diffuse pattern of gfp-skl seen at this stage in the dorsal structures of uninjected embryos . further, there was also a relative increase in the number of punctate structures at stage  <dig> following ha-pex11β and gfp-skl , compared to the microinjection of gfp-skl alone .

discussion
pex <dig> proteins were first identified in yeast as peroxisomal membrane proteins that could increase peroxisome number when overexpressed and significantly reduce peroxisome number when interrupted  <cit> . early studies suggested that pex <dig> proteins acted primarily on medium-chain fatty acid oxidation, affecting peroxisome divisions indirectly  <cit> . schrader and colleagues were the first to show in human fibroblasts that overexpression of human pex11β was sufficient to induce peroxisome proliferation  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that pex11β participates in peroxisome divisions through membrane elongation and shape changes of existing peroxisomes. elongated membranes fill with imported matrix proteins, form into small blebs and separate into new peroxisomes with the aid of dynamin-like protein  <cit> . while yeast studies have shown that peroxisomes only arise through division  <cit> , and mammalian cell studies have suggested that they arise from both de novo and division mechanisms  <cit> , little is known about peroxisome biogenesis during embryonic development. the question of peroxisome inheritance remains largely unresolved, particularly as we have shown that peroxisomes are absent in early frog embryos, and arise only later due to embryonic and or metabolic cues  <cit> .

we tested whether overexpression of pex11β could induce an early-onset to peroxisome biogenesis or accumulation during early xenopus embryogenesis. this is particularly intriguing, as stage  <dig> embryos have no detectable peroxisomes. thus, as pex11β participates in peroxisome division, and no detectable peroxisomes are present in early embryos, xenopus represents a novel model where the role of pex11β in peroxisome number can be examined. the utility of microinjection and relative ease of expression and localization assays enables specific questions related to pex11β to be addressed. first, we sought to show that pex11β is sufficient to regulate peroxisome related protein and rna levels, and increase the number of peroxisomes in x. laevis a <dig> cells. our rt-pcr analysis indicated significant increases in rna levels for both catalase and pmp <dig>  amongst other genes, following overexpression of pex11β. using western blot analysis we confirmed that ha-pex11β increased catalase and pmp <dig> proteins levels, and immunohistochemistry confirmed that ha-pex11β increased the number of both catalase and pmp <dig> positive punctate structures in a <dig> cells. additionally, as gfp-skl can be transported into peroxisomes, co-transfection of ha-pex11β and gfp-skl revealed an increase in the number of peroxisome-like structures. these results strongly support the idea that pex11β can independently promote increases to the number of peroxisomes in xenopus a <dig> cells.

the primary focus of our study was to elucidate the role of pex11β in vivo. very little is known about what cellular mechanisms regulate the de novo biogenesis of peroxisome during xenopus development. using a different gfp-kanl reporter, we had previously reported their detection at stage  <dig> in the ectoderm  <cit> . histochemical studies in frog have suggested that yolk protein and lipid metabolism occurs at different stages in different tissues  <cit> . interestingly, early yolk metabolism is seen in the newly formed muscles - the somites, but not in the large yolk-filled endodermal cells that are present on the ventral side of the embryo  <cit> . here, using ha-pex11β and other specific assays, we demonstrate that peroxisomes are detectable in somites at stage  <dig>  but not at stage  <dig> 

in agreement with the presence of peroxisome by stage  <dig>  the rna levels of most peroxisomal genes examined changed temporally during early development. pex11β pex <dig>  catalase, and pmp <dig> showed increasing trends in expression as development proceeded, peaking stage  <dig>  with cytosolic-bound peroxisomal receptor pex <dig> not varying during these stages. this suggested that transcripts are present and increasing towards the eventual onset of peroxisome biogenesis and/or their subsequent proliferation. these changes in pex <dig> and pex11β rna levels relate well with previous studies that have demonstrated their roles in division  <cit> . if pex11β did play a key regulatory role, we next determined how microinjecting ha-pex11β mrna would affect the relative levels of key peroxisomal genes. changes of pex11β rna levels simply reflect and confirm the presence on the transfected construct. the pex11β resulted in the significant increases in rna levels for catalase and pmp <dig> at all stages tested . there were also increases in the levels of pex <dig> and pex <dig> at two of the three stages examined, however, these changes were not as dramatic. from this data, we conclude that pex11β can play a role in the early induction of these peroxisomal genes. interestingly, as was examined with pex11β in a <dig> cells, pparα rna levels increased, pparγ decreased, and pparδ was unchanged by ectopic pex11β in embryos. given that pparα has roles in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, pparγ role in lipid catabolism and adipocyte differentiation, and that while expressed ubiquitously, pparδ functions remain unclear, the significance of our findings are not known. furthermore, the relationship between ppars, other metabolic regulators, yolk utilization and peroxisome numbers certainly bears further investigation.

we focused on the distribution of catalase and pmp <dig> protein within the somites and found that catalase and pmp <dig> proteins are first localized as punctate structures suggestive of peroxisomes at stage  <dig>  with no detectable signal at stage  <dig>  to corroborate this immunological finding we microinjected gfp-skl rna, whose product could be transported into peroxisomes. our stage  <dig> histology sections revealed diffuse signals from gfp, indicating that peroxisomes are not yet present, as the skl-tagged gfp was not localized. however, we were able to show that gfp-skl localized to punctate-like structures in the somites at stage  <dig>  indicating that peroxisomes are present at this stage.

with these results in mind, we next tested whether microinjecting ha-pex11β rna could induce an early accumulation to the number of peroxisomes. while peroxisomes are present at stage  <dig>  perhaps all needed precursors are present earlier in the embryo and waiting a developmental or metabolic cue to form functional peroxisomes. following the microinjection of ha-pex11β, we were able to visualize peroxisome-like structures using gfp-skl at stage  <dig>  this suggested that needed peroxisomal precursors, including matrix proteins and other division proteins, such as dynamin-like proteins are present. interestingly, together with the data that showed that ha-pex11β injections increased the transcription of peroxisomal genes, this suggests that pex11β is a key regulator of peroxisome onset and proliferation during xenopus development. for the first time, we are able to show that pex11β can independently induce an early onset to peroxisome accumulation in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
from our data we conclude that xenopus pex11β plays a role in regulating peroxisome number both in a <dig> cells in vitro and in vivo in embryos. ectopic expression in vivo demonstrated for the first time pex11β's ability to induce peroxisome related gene expression, and additionally to promote the early formation of peroxisome-like structures in embryos.
