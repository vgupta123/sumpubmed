BACKGROUND
transketolase  catalyzes the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond adjacent to a carbonyl group in ketosugars and transfers a two-carbon ketol group to aldosugars  <cit> , a reaction that might already have occurred under prebiotic conditions  <cit> . tkt requires divalent cations and thiamine diphosphate  as a cofactor for its activity  <cit> . tkt is a key enzyme of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway , the calvin cycle and the ribulose monophosphate  cycle. in these metabolic pathways, two ketol group transfers are relevant, the interconversion of xylulose 5-phosphate  and ribose 5-phosphate  to sedoheptulose 7-phosphate  and glyceraldehyde phosphate  and the interconversion of gap and fructose 6-phosphate  to erythrose 4-phosphate  and x5-p  <cit> . these substrates of tkt are important as precursors e.g. for nucleotide biosynthesis , biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids  and for cell wall biosynthesis in gram-negative bacteria . they are also intermediates of central pathways of carbon metabolism e.g. glycolysis  and the calvin and rump pathways  <cit> .

tkt occurs in animals, plants, yeasts, archaea and bacteria like corynebacterium glutamicum <cit> . properties of purified tkt have been reported mostly for eukaryotes like baker’s yeast  <cit> , spinach  <cit> , rat liver  <cit> , mouse brain  <cit> , human leukocytes/erythrocytes  <cit>  but also from bacteria such escherichia coli <cit> . tkt is usually a homodimer with two active centers located at the interface between the contacting monomers. methylotrophic yeasts possess a related enzyme, dihydroxyacetone synthases , which catalyzes the two-carbon ketol transfer from x5-p to formaldehyde yielding dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and gap. thus, in these yeasts formaldehyde is assimilated by dhas and the products dhap and gap are further metabolized to regenerate the x5-p and in other reactions of the central carbon metabolism  <cit> . dhas has been purified from candida boidinii <cit>  and from the carboxydobacterium acinetobacter sp.  <cit>  and is likely to be present in the actinomycete amycolatopsis methanolica <cit> . besides dhas and tkt also dhas-like proteins have been described, but their function remains unknown  <cit> .

the gram-positive, thermotolerant and facultative methylotrophic bacterium bacillus methanolicus that can use the one-carbon  compound methanol as a source of carbon and energy  <cit>  possesses two genes annotated to encode tkt  <cit> . one of them is encoded on the chromosome , while the other one was found on the natural occurring plasmid pbm <dig>   <cit> . while the enzymes have not yet been characterized it has been proposed that they play an important role in the ppp and the rump pathway  <cit> .

the initial reaction of methanol utilization in b. methanolicus is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde catalyzed by methanol dehydrogenase   <cit> . it is known that b. methanolicus possesses three distinct active mdhs  <cit> . reduction equivalents are generated by the linear dissimilation pathway of formaldehyde to co <dig> and also by the ppp  <cit> . however, no formaldehyde dehydrogenase  was found in b. methanolicus <cit> . formaldehyde assimilation in b. methanolicus occurs via the rump pathway, which is divided in three different parts: fixation, cleavage and regeneration. the key reactions of the rump cycle are the aldol condensation of formaldehyde with ribulose 5-phosphate by 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase  and the subsequent isomerization of the product, d-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate, to fructose 6-phosphate by 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase  in the fixation part. fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate  is generated in the subsequent phosphofructokinase reaction . fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase  cleaves fbp into gap and dhap. b. methanolicus has one chromosomal- and one plasmid-encoded fba . both catalyze the reversible cleavage of fbp to the triose phosphates gap and dhap  <cit> . we recently showed that fbap is presumably the major gluconeogenic fba while fbac is the major glycolytic fba in this bacterium  <cit> . the regeneration phase of the rump pathway, in which ru5-p is regenerated, shares enzymes with the ppp and glycolysis  <cit>  . two different variants of the regeneration part of the rump pathway are known, the ta  variant and the sbpase  variant. based on its genome sequence, b. methanolicus possesses the whole genetic equipment for both variants of the rump pathway  <cit> . in the ta variant, s7-p is directly generated from f6-p and e4-p by a ta activity, while the sbpase variant requires the activity of a sedoheptulose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase  to generate sedoheptulose  <dig> -bisphosphate  and an sbpase activity for the further conversion of sbp to s7-p. we recently demonstrated, that both fbas from b. methanolicus are promiscuous enzymes also active as sba, while only the plasmid encoded glpxp was active as fbpase and sbpase, which indicates that the sbpase variant of the rump pathway might operate in this organism  <cit> . three enzymes, transketolase , ribose 5-phosphate isomerase  and ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase , are shared in both variants. in the rump pathway, the predicted function of the tkt is identical to the ppp and calvin cycle.

it has been shown that the natural plasmid pbm <dig> carries the key mdh gene and five genes with deduced roles in the rump pathway . the absence of pbm <dig> results in the loss of the ability to grow on methanol and caused higher methanol tolerance and reduced formaldehyde tolerance levels in b. methanolicus cells  <cit> . transcription levels of mdh and the five plasmid encoded rump pathway genes, as well as the chromosomal genes hps and phi, were increased during growth with methanol suggesting their importance for methylotrophy  <cit> . notably,  <dig> fold higher mrna tkt
p
 levels were found in methanol- as compared to mannitol-grown cells  <cit> . methanol consumption by this organism involves the concerted recruitment of both plasmid and chromosomal genes, and this discovery represented the first documentation of plasmid dependent methylotrophy  <cit> .

the plasmid-encoded enzymes characterized to date differ from their chromosomally encoded counterparts as e.g. the three mdh enzymes exhibit different biochemical and physical properties and their genes are regulated differently  <cit> . glpxc was shown to be the major fbpase of b. methanolicus, while glpxp also carries sbpase activity  <cit> . both fbac and fbap are sbas, but their kinetic parameters allowed to distinguish fbac as major glycolytic fba and fbap as major gluconeogenic fba  <cit> . the objective of this study was to characterize the role and enzymatic properties of the two tkts from b. methanolicus to get further insight into the genetic and biochemical aspects of methylotrophy

RESULTS

. the deduced primary sequences of these proteins show a similarity of 87%  and an identity of 76%  to each other. the closest homolog of tktc present in the database is the chromosomally encoded homolog  of b. methanolicus strain pb <dig>  similarly, the closest homolog of plasmid encoded tktp is the tkt  from b. methanolicus pb <dig> , which is encoded on plasmid pbm <dig>  blast analyses of the amino acid sequences of tktc and tktp as queries suggested their classification as tkt with more than  <dig> sequences sharing 50% or more identical amino acids. an amino acid sequence alignment with biochemically characterized and experimentally verified tkts from e. coli k <dig>  encoded by tkta and tktb <cit> , plasmodium falciparum, encoded by pftk <cit> , leishmania mexicana, encoded by tkt <cit> , trypanosoma brucei, encoded by tbtkt <cit> , and saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by sctk <cit>  revealed the presence of highly conserved amino acid residues throughout the sequence with two notable motifs . the first n- terminal located motif is common to all thiamindiphosphat -dependent enzymes. the sequence begins with the highly conserved residues gly-asp-gly  followed by  <dig> less conserved residues  <cit> . the second so-called tk motif is specific for all tkts  <cit> .

in order to study if the tkt

 and pth1-tkt
p
 were constructed based on pth <dig> and with the tkt coding sequences under control of the methanol-inducible mdh promoter  <cit>  and used to transform b. methanolicus. to confirm overexpression, tkt activities were determined in crude extracts of the resulting recombinant cells after growth in sobsuc medium with or without 200 mm methanol. b. methanolicus carrying the empty vector pth <dig> showed similar tkt activities regardless of the presence of the inducer . when induced by methanol, the overexpression strains carrying either pth1-tkt
c
 or pth1-tkt
p
 showed significantly increased tkt activities of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u mg- <dig>  respectively, as compared to non-inducing conditions . thus, overexpression of tkt
c
 and tkt
p
 indeed increased transketolase activities 4– <dig> fold, confirming that both genes encode functionally active tkts.

gel filtration of both proteins and tkt activity assays of the eluted fractions showed that both proteins eluted in a single fraction indicating that they are active as homotetramers with molecular weights for the tetramers of 280 kda.


 determining the optimal conditions for tkt activity

the optimal assay conditions of the tkt enzymes were determined by using a coupled spectrometric assay for measuring the formation of gap from r5-p and x5-p . the activity of the auxiliary enzymes tpi and gpd were first checked under the different conditions and added in excess. measurements were performed in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer at 55°c and by using substrate concentrations of 1 mm for both tktc and tktp, which is  <dig> and  <dig> times greater than the determined km values for tktc and tktp, respectively  activity could be measured for both enzymes within a broad ph range between  <dig> - <dig> for tktc and  <dig> - <dig> for tktp with a ph optimum of ph  <dig> - <dig>  for both enzymes. all subsequent assays were performed at ph  <dig> , the putative physiologically relevant ph.

the influence of the temperature, the ph, the effect of some metal ions and effectors were analyzed using enzyme assay i . tkt activity in different buffers was tested and found to be almost independent of the buffer substance used in concentrations between 20 mm and 200 mm. phosphate buffer, however, showed an inhibitory effect of the tkt activity of approximately 40%.

the highest activity of both tkts was determined around 62°c, which corresponds roughly to the upper limit growth temperature of b. methanolicus. temperatures higher than these resulted in strongly decreased tkt activities, which could be, to some extent, explained by the instability of the substrates triose phosphates  <cit>  and/or reflect denaturation of the enzymes.

displays higher temperature stability than tkt


p


the thermal stability of both tkts was tested by pre-incubation of the proteins at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 80°c. samples were taken in different time periods and the activity was measured at 50°c under standard conditions. both tkts remained stable up to 50°c for at least  <dig> hours. upon pre-incubation at 60°c the catalytic activity was reduced for both enzymes to approximately 60% within  <dig> minutes and then remained stable at this level. incubation at 70°c led to a complete loss of activity for tktc after  <dig> minutes, for tktp after  <dig> minutes of incubation.

 formation of the tkt apoform and reconstitution of the holoenzyme revealed a bivalent metal ion dependency for activity
during optimization of the assay conditions for the tkt activity, a dependence of bivalent cation for both tkts was observed. therefore, the apo-tkt form was obtained for both b. methanolicus tkts by removing any bound cofactors via dialysis for  <dig> hours against tris–hcl buffer containing 10 mm edta. after edta was removed by subsequent dialysis, different divalent metal ions, including co2+, ni2+, cu2+, mn2+, mg2+ and ca2+ were tested as putative cofactors for both tkts at a final concentration of 1 mm . reconstitution of the tkt activity was stimulated by mn2+, mg2+, co2+, ca2+ and cu2+. the addition of ni2+ did not restore the tkt activity at all, while slow reconstitution was observed with water, presumably due to contamination of substrates or buffer components with divalent cations.


 tkt activities are inhibited by atp, adp, edta and ni


2+


to identify inhibitors or activators of b. methanolicus tkt activity, potential effectors were tested at concentrations of  <dig> and 5 mm. tktp and tktc were both inhibited by atp  and by adp . edta in concentration of 10 mm resulted for both tkt in a completely loss of activity. ni2+ at a concentration of 1 mm also led to a complete loss of activity for both tkt.

tktp and tktc share similar kinetic parameters and substrate spectrum
the kinetic parameters of tktc and tktp were determined for the conversion of f6-p and gap to x5-p and e4-p as well as for the formation of s7-p and gap from x5-p and r5-p in vitro . the assays were performed at 60°c and ph  <dig>  in 50 mm tris–hcl with 2 mm mncl <dig> and 1 μm thdp. both recombinant tkts catalyzed the conversion of x5-p and r5-p to gap and s7-p with comparable kinetic parameters. for x5-p and tktc a km of 150 μm ± 4 μm and a vmax of 34 ±  <dig> u/mg could be determined, whereas tktp displayed a km of 232 μm ± 2 μm and vmax of 45 ±  <dig> u/mg. similar parameters could be measured for the second substrate r5-p, for which tktc has a km of 118 μm ± 13 μm and a vmax of 11 ±  <dig> u/mg, tktp shows a km of 250 μm ± 13 μm and vmax of 18 ±  <dig> u/mg. the catalytic efficiencies for both tkts are accordingly quite similar for x5-p  and this also holds for r5-p . comparable catalytic efficiencies could be calculated for gap  while for f6-p the catalytic efficiency for tktp is about 4-fold higher than that of tktc  following affinities were observed for gap  and f6-p .

values for km , vmax , and catalytic efficiency  were determined for two independent protein purifications and mean values and arithmetric deviations from the mean are given.

the kinetics of the reverse reactions could not be determined since neither e4-p nor s7-p are currently available commercially. an additional activity as dhas, as found in methylotrophic yeasts, or as the evolutionary related dxp synthase could not be observed.

discussion
the biochemical results provided here show that the plasmid  and chromosomally  encoded tkts are similar and based on these data it is not feasible to predict their individual roles for methylotrophy in b. methanolicus. both tkts are active as homotetramers, a characterisitic shared with tkts from triticum aestivum and sus scrova <cit> , but different from several microbial tkts such as the enzymes from e. coli <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit>  and rhodobacer sphaeroides <cit> . the requirement of bivalent cations for the activity of tkt from b. methanolicus with a preference of mn2+. mg2+, and ca2+ is a common feature of tkts, while the efficiency for the cations varies between different tkts  <cit> . it was assumed in the past, that purified mammalian tkts do not require the addition of cofactors to maintain activity  <cit> . this led to the wrong conclusion that these enzymes did not require bivalent cations for activity. this was because the complex of tkt with thdp and cation is strong enough to carry the cofactors along the purification steps and though tkt remaining active. the cation can be removed by dialysis against edta  <cit> . both tkts showed comparable biochemical properties. this is in contrast to the recently characterized and biochemically diverse mdhs from b. methanolicus, which displayed different biochemical and regulatory properties  <cit> . both tkts were shown to be thermo stable at physiological temperature  of b. methanolicus. neutral ph  was also reported to be optimal for both enzymes of e. coli <cit>  and s. cerevisiae <cit>  and rhodobacter sphaeroides <cit> . inhibition by atp and adp is unusual, however, since the intracellular concentrations of atp and adp in b. methanolicus are not known, it is difficult to judge the relevance of this inhibition in vivo.

tkt has been found so far in all organisms that have been investigated  <cit> . the presence of more than one tkt however, as described here for b. methanolicus is not a common phenomenon. two tkts are known in s. cerevisiae, encoded by tkl <dig> and tkl <dig> <cit> , and e. coli, encoded by tkta and tktb <cit> . as in b. methanolicus, the tkts of e. coli and s. cerevisiae exhibit comparable kinetic parameters. however, deletion of tkl <dig>  probably encoding the main tkt in s. cerevisiae, impaired growth in synthetic medium without added aromatic amino acids, whereas deletion of tkl <dig> did not cause such phenotype. in e. coli, the tkta gene product is the major isoenzyme and accounts for about  <dig> to 90% of tkt activity in cells and tkta mutants are highly sensitive to the presence of d-ribose, while tktb deletion mutants are not. tkta tktb double mutants are viable, but deficient in pentose catabolism and they require the addition of all three aromatic amino acids, aromatic vitamins and pyridoxine . transketolase a from escherichia coli was shown to derepress the multiple antibiotic resistance operon marrab by binding to the repressor marr  <cit> . it remains to be shown if the tkts from b. methanolicus show regulatory interactions with transcriptional repressors and if tktp and tktc differ in this respect.

besides the common sugar phosphates f6-p, r5-p, gap, x5-p and e4-p, tkts from spinach leaves and s. cerevisiae are able to also utilize dhap, dihydroxyacetone  and hp  <cit> . the reaction of tkts with formaldehyde  is known in methylotrophic yeasts  <cit>  and was recently also reported for transketolase a of e. coli <cit> . however, among all substrates tested, both tkts form b. methanolicus were only active with x5-p and r5-p as well as f6-p and gap. similar substrate specificity was described for mammalian tkts  <cit> . based on the catalytic efficiency  tktp appears better suited for the interconversion of s7-p and gap to r5-p and x5-p.

about  <dig> fold higher mrna levels of tktp, but not of tktc, were previously observed when comparing growth in minimal medium with methanol and mannitol  <cit> . this induction was not observed here when assaying crude extracts of b. methanolicus mga <dig> which carries endogenous plasmid pbm <dig> after growth in complex medium sobsuc induced with 200 mm methanol. likely, this difference is due to the use of different media, namely complex medium with methanol vs. methanol minimal medium.

CONCLUSIONS
both, tktp and tktc, showed comparable kinetic parameters. the about  <dig> fold increased mrna levels of tkt
p
 and of other rump pathway genes on the plasmid pbm <dig>  which is essential for methanol utilization  <cit>  during growth in methanol minimal medium as compared to growth in mannitol minimal medium  <cit>  argues for tktp being the major tkt relevant in the rump pathway. in line with this argumentation, methanol-inducible glpxp carries sbpase activity, which is relevant in the rump pathway  <cit> , while the chromosomally encoded glpxc is the major fbpase in gluconeogenesis and is not methanol-inducible.
