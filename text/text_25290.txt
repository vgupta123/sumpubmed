BACKGROUND
understanding transcriptional regulation of gene expression is a major challenge in molecular biology. in eukaryotes, regulation of gene expression is achieved through the complex interaction of transcription factors, which bind to specific dna sequence motifs. these motifs are predominantly located in the upstream region of genes. over the last decades, numerous transcription factors have been identified, each with its own specific dna binding sequence . transcription factors that are potentially involved in the regulation of a particular gene are usually identified by the presence of the specific dna binding motif in the upstream regulatory region. these binding motifs are compiled in libraries such as the transfac database  <cit> , and programs such as matinspector enable pattern recognition with the entries in this database  <cit> . unfortunately, most transcription factors bind to short, degenerate sequences, which occur very frequently in the eukaryotic genome. only a very small fraction of all predicted binding sites is biologically relevant  <cit> . recently, new strategies for the ab initio identification of functionally significant cis-acting regulatory sequences have been developed, based on the assumption that regulatory elements are conserved among multiple species  <cit> , and that multiple tfbs tend to specifically cluster together  <cit> . the rvista computational tool for identification of functional regulatory elements combines the comparative sequence analysis of orthologous genes with the analysis of clustering of predicted tfbs  <cit> . in this study, we tested the validity of this approach to identify functional tfbs for the mammalian hepatic lipase genes, by comparing the in silico data with experimental promoter-reporter assays.

hepatic lipases  are synthesized and secreted almost exclusively by hepatocytes  <cit> . although synthesis of hl has been shown to occur in mouse adrenals  <cit> , and in mouse and human macrophages  <cit> , this is negligible compared to expression in liver. the hl activity present in adrenals and ovaries  <cit>  originates predominantly from liver, and is transported through the circulation to these organs  <cit> . in liver, the enzyme is bound to cell surface proteoglycans within the sinusoids, from where it can be released by heparin. hepatic lipase plays an important role in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and intracellular lipid homeostasis  <cit> , by mediating cholesterol influx into liver cells from high-density lipoproteins , and clearance of remnant lipoproteins from the circulation by the liver. hl is an important determinant of plasma hdl cholesterol levels, and is implicated in the protection against development of premature atherosclerosis by hdl  <cit> . hl gene expression in humans and rodents is regulated by various hormones and nutritional states mainly at the transcriptional level, but up- or downregulation is limited to about two-fold  <cit> . in contrast to this moderate regulation by hormones and nutrition, the almost complete restriction of hl gene expression to differentiated liver cells is highly conspicuous  <cit> . several groups have pointed to the hnf <dig> and hnf4α binding sites in the proximal promoter of the hl gene to explain this liver-specificity in humans  <cit> . since the liver-restricted expression is a common feature of most, if not all, mammalian hl genes, we hypothesize that the regulatory elements responsible for liver-specific expression are conserved among mammals. we therefore searched the upstream regulatory region of the rat, mouse, rhesus monkey and human genes for the presence of conserved clusters of tfbs motifs, and combined the in silico data with experimental promoter-reporter assays in cultured cells of hepatic versus non-hepatic origin. this unbiased approach led to the identification of two putative enhancer elements in the far upstream region, and of highly conserved sequence modules within the proximal promoter of the hl genes.

RESULTS
interspecies comparison of genomic hl sequences
of the mammalian hl genes, genome sequence including part of the 5'-flanking region is available for human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, rat, mouse and hedgehog  <cit> . pairwise alignment of the hl coding sequences shows the expected, high degree of sequence identity . this high homology also extends into the 5'-utr and upstream-regulatory region, with sequence identity ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> % over the proximal  <dig> – <dig>  kb. multiple sequence alignment of 30-kb of the 5'-flanking region available for five hl genes  was performed by the mvista web-tool . the chimp and macaque sequences are highly homologous to the human sequence, as  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the 30-kb region showed at least  <dig> % sequence identity over a 100-bp window, respectively. similarly,  <dig> % of the rat sequence showed this high degree of sequence identity with the orthologous mouse sequence. because of the near-identity of the chimp to the human sequence, we only included the latter sequence in subsequent in silico analysis. the global genomic sequence comparison showed a particularly high conservation among the four genes immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site . three additional islands of highly significant homology  were identified further upstream. conservation of a  <dig> bp element at - <dig> kb was even more significant  than the proximal hl promoter region . the element at - <dig> kb  contained a  <dig> bp sequence that was completely identical among the three primate sequences.

to test the potential enhancer function of two of the most conserved elements in the far upstream regulatory region, promoter-reporter assays were performed with human hl promoter constructs in transiently transfected hepg <dig> hepatoma cells. the - <dig> kb element  and the - <dig> kb element  were inserted in the hhl-685luc plasmid. as a control, we also tested the activity of the non-conserved - <dig> kb sequence . the transcriptional activity of the human hl -685/+ <dig> promoter region was increased 3- and 2-fold with the - <dig> kb and - <dig> kb elements inserted in the sense orientation, respectively . in contrast, the - <dig> kb sequence slightly but significantly reduced hl promoter activity . qualitatively similar effects were obtained when the elements were inserted in the anti-sense orientation . hence, the conserved sequences at - <dig> kb and - <dig> kb have moderate enhancer activity of the proximal hl promoter region.

comparative genomics of the proximal  <dig> kb hl upstream regulatory region
submission of 2-kb upstream sequence of the rat hl gene to the matinspector software program  returned over  <dig> potential tfbs, randomly distributed over the entire sequence. a similar number of sites was predicted for the orthologous mouse, human and rhesus macaque sequences. when we searched for clustered tfbs motifs that are conserved between the rat and human sequence, using the web-tool rvista, three separate modules were identified within the proximal promoter region . module a , for which ap <dig>  ap <dig>  caat, coup, c/ebp, hnf4α, ppar and usf binding sites are predicted, corresponds to the dr <dig> site recently identified by rufibach et al.  <cit> . module b  potentially contains ap <dig>  caat, c/ebp, hnf <dig>  hnf <dig>  ppar and sp <dig> sites, and corresponds to the previously characterized hnf <dig> site  <cit> . module c , which may bind ap <dig>  c/epb, hnf <dig>  ppar and usf factors, contains the transcription start site preceded by a conserved pyrimidine-rich motif, and therefore likely represents the inr involved in binding of the transcription initiation complex. these three modules were also found to be conserved among the human and mouse hl gene. the human-mouse comparison revealed an additional, conserved module , with potential binding sites for ap <dig>  c/ebp, hnf <dig>  hnf <dig>  ppar and sp <dig>  and which partly overlaps the dr4-site recently described by rufibach et al.  <cit> . similar results were obtained in pairwise comparisons between orthologous sequences of macaque and rat, and of macaque and mouse. despite the high homology in the intervening sequence between modules a and b, the rvista program did not recognize conserved clusters of tfbs among the human, macaque, rat and mouse. irrespective of which transcription factors actually bind to these sites, the results of the interspecies sequence comparison by rvista suggest that the three highly conserved sequence modules in the proximal hl promoter region are involved in common features of transcriptional regulation. this is further supported by the fact that these three modules correspond to distinct dna footprints of the human hl sequence in rat liver  <cit>  and human hepg <dig> cells  <cit> .

functional characterization of the rat hl promoter region
to corroborate the in silico results, promoter-reporter assays were performed with promoter fragments of the rat hl gene in transiently transfected hepg <dig> cells. plasmids were constructed with progressively 5'-deleted promoter fragments spanning the -2287/+ <dig> region of the rat hl gene in front of the cat reporter gene. compared to the sv <dig> promoter, the rhl- <dig> construct showed low cat expression . upon deleting the 5'-end of the hl promoter fragments to position - <dig>  cat expression became even lower, and was no longer significantly different from promoter-less pcat-basic, suggesting that there is weak enhancer activity between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig>  further deletion to position - <dig> slightly increased promoter activity to levels significantly above background. shortening the insert from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in a 5-fold increase in promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a strong negative regulatory element in this region of the rat hl gene. cat expression was not significantly affected by deleting the insert from - <dig> to - <dig>  the presence of the weak enhancer element between - <dig> and - <dig>  and the negative element between - <dig> and - <dig> corresponds to positive and negative elements in the human hl upstream regulatory region observed by oka et al.  <cit> . we assume, therefore, that both these elements are present in homologous parts of the rat and human gene. indeed, the global alignment of the four species by mvista detected homology at these parts of the gene , but homology did not exceed the  <dig> % over  <dig> bp mark used as threshold in this analysis. apparently, potentially important elements may be missed due to the high stringency of the conservation rule in the mvista program.

to test the importance of the conserved sequence modules within the - <dig> to + <dig> region, further 5'-deletions in the rat hl promoter region were made . transcriptional activity of the rhl- <dig> construct, in which module a has been removed, was not significantly different from that of the rhl- <dig> or rhl- <dig> constructs. similarly, removal of the highly conserved intervening sequence between modules a and b  had no significant effect on cat expression. in contrast, additional removal of most of module b in rhl- <dig> reduced transcriptional activity by approximately  <dig> %. with rhl- <dig>  in which the remainder of module b as well as the putative tata-box has been deleted, cat expression decreased further. despite absence of the tata-box, cat expression of the rhl- <dig> construct was significantly higher than of promoter-less pcat-basic, which may be due to residual promoter activity of module c.

comparison with the proximal human hl promoter region
similar promoter-reporter assays were performed with the -685/+ <dig> region of the orthologous human hl gene, except that the luciferase gene was used as reporter . luciferase activity of the hhl- <dig> construct was similar to hhl- <dig>  whereas activity of the hhl- <dig> construct was slightly, but not significantly, higher. this is in line with the rat promoter data, which show little effect of module a, and of the intervening sequence between modules a and b, on basal transcriptional activity in hepg <dig> cells. the luciferase activity of the hhl- <dig> construct, in which entire module b has been removed, was only  <dig> % of the hhl- <dig> construct. the transcriptional activity of hhl- <dig>  which contains a bona fide tata box and entire module c, was 7-fold higher than background. this confirms that modules b and c are crucial for basal transcriptional activity in hepg <dig> cells, with module b being most important.

role of module b in liver cell-specific hl transcription
to test whether modules a and b are involved in liver-specific expression of the hl gene, we compared transcriptional activity of different rat hl promoter fragments in hepg <dig> cells with non-hepatic hela cells . promoter activity in each cell line was expressed as percentage of that of the rhl- <dig> construct, because this fragment represents the minimal promoter with the tata-box and transcription start site. in the hepatoma cells, the activity of the rhl- <dig> construct was  <dig> – <dig> fold higher than the minimal promoter construct. in hela cells, contrastingly, transcriptional activity of rhl- <dig> was 2– <dig> fold lower than the minimal promoter construct in hela cells. consequently, there was a marked, 3–5-fold difference in relative promoter activity between these two cell lines. similar results were obtained with the longer rat hl constructs that all contained module b. the data were minimally affected by the simultaneous presence of module a . qualitatively similar results were obtained with human hl promoter fragments . we conclude therefore, that module b plays a pivotal role in liver-restricted expression of the hl gene, by moderately activating transcription in liver cells, and simultaneously suppressing activity in non-hepatic cells.

discussion
global alignment of the 5'-flanking region of mammalian hl genes revealed three highly conserved elements  that lie far upstream of the hl promoter . two of these elements, at - <dig> kb and - <dig> kb, show moderate enhancer activity in hepg <dig> cells. what discriminates the conserved - <dig> kb and - <dig> kb elements from the non-functional, non-conserved - <dig> kb sequence is unclear, as all three sequences contain a similar repertoire of tfbs for liver-expressed transcription factors . further studies are required to clarify the mechanism responsible for the enhancer activity of the two highly conserved elements in the hl gene. the finding of two hitherto unknown enhancers supports the hypothesis that conserved non-coding sequences may identify functional regulatory elements. experimentally, we also found a positive and a negative regulatory sequence between - <dig>  and - <dig>  kb of the rat hl gene that coincided with homology peaks, but were not recognized by the rankvista analysis of the sequence comparison. rubin's group recently demonstrated strong in vivo enhancer activity for almost half of the elements that are ultra-conserved among human/mouse/rat  <cit> . our study further illustrates the power of the approach, and suggests that gene regulatory functions may also reside in somewhat less conserved elements among mammalian genomes.

we also tested whether global genome comparisons can also aid in identification of functional regulatory elements within highly conserved sequences, using the proximal hl promoter region as a model. within this proximal promoter region, three modules are identified with conserved clusters of tfbs motifs. these modules a, b and c correspond with the previously identified regulatory elements dr <dig>  <cit> , hnf <dig>  <cit>  and inr  <cit> , respectively. however, we missed an additional module  that has recently been identified as a functional dr <dig> site  <cit> . the cluster of tfbs within this module appeared to be conserved among human and mouse, but not among human and rat. despite the relatively high homology between the mouse and rat over the proximal 5'-flanking region of the hl gene , the outcome of the genomic sequence analysis differed whether the rat or the mouse sequence was used. hence, although searching genomic sequences for conserved clusters of tfbs is a valuable tool in predicting functionally important regulatory elements, this approach is sub optimal.

for two of the modules that are conserved among the four species, a significant contribution to basal transcription was confirmed by promoter-assays in hepg <dig> cells. for module c , this is not surprising since it contains the transcriptional start site itself, as well as a pyrimidine-rich stretch that may serve as an initiator region . module b  overlaps with a protected region in dnase footprinting in rat liver  <cit>  as well as in hepg <dig> cells  <cit> , and contains a hnf <dig> binding site that has been implicated in liver-specific expression of the human hl gene by other groups  <cit> . experimentally, we could not confirm a major role for module a  in determining basal transcription activity in hepg <dig> cells. this is surprising since it corresponds to a functional dr <dig> site  <cit> , and perfectly matches with a protected region in dnase footprinting in rat liver and human hepg <dig> nuclear extracts  <cit> , suggesting that this part of the hl promoter is occupied by transcription factors under basal conditions. similarly, we could not confirm the role of the dr <dig> module  conserved among human and mouse, in basal transcriptional activity in hepg <dig> cells. we propose, therefore, that this part of the hl promoter region is involved in modulation of gene transcription under different hormonal or nutritional conditions.

we show here that the conserved module b  plays a dual role in mediating liver-restricted transcription of the hl gene. on the one hand, the module mediates moderate stimulation of minimal promoter activity in liver-derived hepg <dig> cells, and on the other hand, it mediates inhibition of minimal promoter activity in the non-hepatic hela cells. of the potential tfbs identified in module b, the liver-enriched hnf <dig> is a likely candidate for effecting the liver-specific activation of the hl promoter. other groups have already suggested an important role for the hnf <dig> binding site  <cit> , and in vitro hnf <dig> binding to this sequence has been demonstrated by gelshift assays  <cit> . furthermore, hnf1α knockout mice have  <dig>  fold lower hl mrna levels than control mice  <cit> . in primary hepatocytes, hl secretion increases with hnf1α gene dosage  <cit> . however, hl mrna and hl secretion are not completely lost by hnf1α knockout, indicating that hnf1α is not the only transcription factor determining hl expression in liver. hl secretion was only observed with hepatoma cell lines that express hnf1α or hnf1β mrna  <cit> , but not all cell lines with detectable hnf1α or -β expression do also secrete hl. in fact, hl secretion correlated with expression of hnf <dig> rather than with hnf <dig> mrna  <cit> . the hnf4α gene itself is a target of hnf1α  <cit> . since potential hnf4α binding sites were detected in the conserved module a , the liver-specific stimulation of hl promoter activity may well be mediated by hnf4α. in fact, hnf4α is bound to the promoter regions of almost half of the actively transcribed genes in human liver  <cit>  and therefore contributes to a large fraction of liver-specific gene expression. sequence modules that contain both hnf <dig> and hnf <dig> binding sites are among the strongest predictors of liver-specific transcription  <cit> . rufibach et al.  <cit>  proposed that hnf1α and hnf4α independently and additively activate hl promoter activity. which transcription factor mediate inhibition of minimal promoter activity in cells of non-hepatic origin, remain unknown at present.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown here that a global multispecies comparison of non-coding sequences, followed by a search for conserved clusters of tfbs, has predicted the most important sequences involved in basal transcription of the hl gene. this in silico analysis does not identify all regulatory sequences in a particular gene, but enables the intelligent design of experiments towards identification of functional cis-regulatory elements and transactivating factors in gene regulation. this study illustrates the power of comparative genomics in the identification of tfbs that are functional in gene expression.
