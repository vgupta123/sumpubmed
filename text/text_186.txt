BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the causative agent of enzootic pneumonia  in pigs. this disease is characterized by chronic non-productive coughing and poor growth rate and feed conversion ratio  <cit> . the disease occurs worldwide and causes significant economic losses to the pig industry  <cit> .

the infection pattern and the severity of the disease in pig herds can be influenced by many factors such as management practices, housing conditions and the virulence of the m. hyopneumoniae strain  <cit> . based on protein and genetic studies of field isolates, there appears to be considerable diversity among this species  <cit> . recently, it has been shown thaq1t within a herd and even within a pig, different strains of m. hyopneumoniae can be present  <cit> . in a recent study, it was shown that disease signs aggravated after infection with a highly virulent  strain when pigs had been previously inoculated with a low virulent  strain  <cit> . the differences in virulence between isolates may be partly due to a differential capacity to provoke an inflammatory response in the host  <cit> .

the diversity between m. hyopneumoniae strains also seems to influence the efficacy of vaccination, with better results for some strains  <cit> . previous reports have shown that the effect of vaccination may, indeed, vary from herd to herd. in most herds, performance losses due to m. hyopneumoniae infection are significantly reduced after vaccination  <cit> . however, there is no or only limited effect on the transmission of this organism  <cit> .

the exact mechanisms of protection after vaccination are not yet fully understood, although both mucosal antibodies and cell-mediated immunity may play a part  <cit> . the preferential targets of the humoral immune response against m. hyopneumoniae are cell-surface proteins, which vary between strains  <cit> . therefore, antibodies induced by vaccination, might be less effective against infection with certain field strains  <cit> .

little is known about the effect of different strains on the pig's immune system. meyns et al.  <cit>  showed that more leukocytes were found in the lung tissue and more il-1β and tnf-α were detected in broncho-alveolar lavage  fluid after infection with a hv strain compared to a lv strain. although the leukocytes were not characterized and only two cytokines were investigated, the hv strain appeared to induce a more severe inflammatory response. the predominant cell types found in the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue  after natural infection with m. hyopneumoniae are macrophages, but t-lymphocytes, b-lymphocytes and to a lesser extent neutrophils are also present  <cit> . macrophages are important in the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. these cytokines are essential in the resolution of the infection, but are also responsible for tissue damage in the host  <cit> .

in the present study, the infiltration of lung tissue with mononuclear cells after infection of pigs with a highly and low virulent m. hyopneumoniae strain was compared and the influence of vaccination on this process was studied.

RESULTS
immunostaining
the results of the scoring of the immunostaining are presented in table  <dig>  when comparing the effect of strain, no significant differences can be seen between the nvhv and the nvlv group though the values of macrophages, t- and b-lymphocytes were consistently highest in the nvhv group. in the groups infected with the hv strain, it was noticed that the scoring of t-lymphocytes remained high at  <dig> weeks post infection while for the other groups a substantial reduction in the score was seen. the difference between nvhv, vhv and control at  <dig> weeks post inoculation had p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

nv non-vaccinated; v vaccinated; lv low virulent challenge strain; hv highly virulent challenge strain

 <dig> scoring was performed on samples of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after endotracheal inoculation with a low or highly virulent m. hyopneumoniae strain. a non-vaccinated and non- infected control group was also included.

 <dig> different lowercase letters correspond to significantly different values between the groups within a column

at  <dig> weeks pi, the density of macrophages in the balt of the non-vaccinated groups was higher compared to the vaccinated groups, though this difference was only significant for the hv strain. at  <dig> weeks, no significant differences were observed for the macrophages though the score in the non-vaccinated groups remained higher than in the vaccinated groups.

quantitative pcr
the number of m. hyopneumoniae organisms was highly variable between individual animals, even in animals belonging to the same group. this resulted in few significant differences between groups, though in some cases high numerical differences were seen . the highest number of m. hyopneumoniae organisms was found in the bal fluid of the nvhv group at four weeks pi . for this group, the number of organisms at  <dig> weeks pi was lower than at  <dig> weeks pi, but the opposite was found for the nvlv group. these changes were, however, not significant . the values in the vaccinated groups were numerically lower than their respective non-vaccinated groups both at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks pi. the differences for the groups infected with the low virulent strain were much smaller than for the groups infected with the highly virulent strain. this is also reflected in the p-values. the difference between the nvhv and the vhv group at  <dig> weeks, when the maximum number of organisms was observed for this strain, has a p-value of  <dig> . for the lv strain the maximum number of organisms was observed at  <dig> weeks pi. the difference between the nvlv and the vlv group at  <dig> weeks pi has a p-value of  <dig> . it is therefore likely that the reduction of the organisms of the hv strain seen by vaccination reflects a true difference measured with insufficient power, but that no true reduction is present for the lv strain.

serology
the results of the serological testing can be found in table  <dig>  before challenge, serum antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae were found only in the vaccinated groups. two weeks after challenge, a rise was seen in the antibody titer of both the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, though the rise was more pronounced in the vaccinated groups. at four weeks pi, all challenged groups showed a higher titer. for the vaccinated groups and the nvhv group, the titer remained stable after  <dig> weeks. only in the nvlv group, a further rise was seen at  <dig> weeks post inoculation. at all time points, the titer in the vaccinated groups was significantly higher than the titer in the non-vaccinated groups.

discussion
in concordance with previous studies, we observed infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in balt after infection with m. hyopneumoniae  <cit> . less macrophages were seen in the balt of the vaccinated pigs compared to the non-vaccinated animals, although this was only significant for the hv strain. this is the first study to show such effect. most studies on the mechanisms of vaccination focus on serum antibodies, neutrophils, lymphocytes and cytokine expression  <cit> . okada et al.  <cit>  observed a reduction of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the balf of vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated after experimental infection. thacker et al.  <cit>  reported less tnf-α in vaccinated animals after experimental infection with m. hyopneumoniae. as the production of this cytokine is induced in macrophages after contact with m. hyopneumoniae  <cit> , this is in concordance with our results.

in the bal fluid collected from the vaccinated groups, the number of m. hyopneumoniae organisms was lower than in the bal fluid of the non-vaccinated groups. this was also mentioned by okada et al.  <cit> . the inhibition of the growth of m. hyopneumoniae by this vaccine was, however, more pronounced for the hv compared to the lv strain suggesting that vaccination might be more effective against the hv strain. in previous studies, the onset of disease and the peak of clinical symptoms was approximately two weeks later after inoculation with the lv strain compared to the hv strain, however the entire clinical picture remained milder in pigs infected with the lv strain  <cit> . it is therefore likely that the two time points included in this trial, did not represent the peak of infection for the lv strain. however, this fact alone cannot explain the more pronounced reduction of organisms for the hv strain compared to the lv strain.

an important first step in the innate immune response against m. hyopneumoniae is the recognition of mycoplasmal antigens by the tlr2/tlr- <dig> complex. though it is not the only pathway involved, the resulting downstream pathway leads to the stimulation of the adaptive immune response  <cit> . the adaptive immune response is responsible for the elimination of the pathogen. however, for m. hyopneumoniae evidence exists that the stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune response is also involved in lung tissue damage  <cit> . we do not have any knowledge about the overall expression patterns of cell-surface proteins of both strains used in the present study, but it is known that there are differences in the proteome of both strains  <cit>  as well as in the vntrs  of several cell-surface proteins and hypothetical cell-surface proteins  <cit> . for one cell-surface protein, the adhesin p <dig>  it has been shown that at least eight pentapeptide tandem repeats in r <dig> are required to bind porcine cilia  <cit> . it is therefore not unlikely that different strains have a different binding affinity to host proteins including the tlr2/tlr <dig> complex and thus activate this complex to a varying degree resulting in a different disease outcome. therefore the resulting downstream pathways may be more important in the stimulation of the immune response for one strain than for another. as a recent study reported that vaccination may reduce the expression of tlr <dig>  <cit> , this may result in a more pronounced reduction of tissue damage by strains that rely more on the tlr2/tlr <dig> complex to stimulate the immune response.

though it is well known that the outcome of m. hyopneumoniae infections can vary considerably between individual animals, even in experimental circumstances, very few efforts have been made to identify the factors influencing this outcome. in the present study, we investigated which parameters were associated with the severity of the disease, determined by the macroscopic and/or microscopic lung lesion score. it became clear that a higher lung lesion score was associated with a higher number of m. hyopneumoniae organisms in the balf and the presence of more immune cells in the balt. this association was more evident in the non-vaccinated infected groups compared to the vaccinated groups . no causal relationship can be deducted from our data, though we suggest the hypothesis that more m. hyopneumoniae organisms cause a higher infiltration of immune cells and this causes more tissue damage leading to more severe lung lesions. meyns et al.  <cit>  observed the same tendencies in an experimental infection study with caesarean-derived colostrums-deprived  piglets, though only a small number of animals was included in this study. ahn et al.  <cit>  found a clinically relevant, though non-significant, association between the concentration of il- <dig> in the lung tissue and the microscopic lung lesion score. the current study is the first to suggest a connection between the number of m. hyopneumoniae, the induction of immune cells and the severity of the lung lesions at the level of the individual pig. it should be noted that the data from qpcr showed much stronger correlations with the microscopic and macroscopic lung lesions compared to if suggesting that qpcr is more suitable to investigate the number of organism that if.

the titer of serum antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae was not associated with severity of the lung lesions at  <dig> weeks post-infection, but a high titer at later time points  was associated with a higher density of immune cells and a higher microscopic lung lesion score at  <dig> weeks pi. this not only confirms the absence of a link between serum antibody titer and protection against infection  <cit> , but it also suggests that a sustained serum response is related to the continuing presence of clinical signs.

CONCLUSIONS
although this study was performed on a limited number of samples, some interesting observations were made. our results suggest that the infiltration of macrophages in balt after infection with m. hyopneumoniae is reduced by vaccination. the growth of m. hyopneumoniae organisms in the lungs is also reduced in vaccinated pigs, though the hv strain is inhibited to a higher extent than the lv strain. this indicates that future studies should focus on the interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes after infection with different strains and the influence of vaccination on this interaction.
