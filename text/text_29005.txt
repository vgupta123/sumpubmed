BACKGROUND
deinococcus geothermalis dsm  <dig> and deinococcus murrayi dsm  <dig> are gram positive, nonmotile, spherical bacteria living in aerobic conditions. cells that divide as tetrads are very common in both species. d. geothermalis and d. murrayi form orange-pigmented colonies, are slightly thermophilic with an optimum growth temperature of between 45-50°c, but differ in optimum ph for growth. d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> is slightly acidophilic and grows optimally at ph  <dig> , while d. murrayi dsm  <dig> is slightly alcaliphilic with an optimum ph for growth of  <dig> , although both species were isolated from the hot springs which had alkaline ph values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . d. geothermalis and d. murrayi were isolated from hot springs at são pedro do sul and alcafache in central portugal, respectively. the isolation of the acidophilic d. geothermalis strain from an alkaline site suggests that it can colonize the microenvironments of alkaline hot springs, such as biofilms, where the ph is lowered by other microorganisms  <cit> . d. geothermalis is also able to grow on metallic surfaces of printing paper machines and it is known as an efficient primary biofilm, formerly functioning as an adhesion platform for secondary biofilm bacteria  <cit> . d. geothermalis and d. murrayi display an increased gamma radiation resistance, as would normally be found in the genus deinococcus  <cit> . the ability of these species to withstand high doses of ionizing radiation might result from an efficient reca-dependent dsb repair system, similar to that recently described in deinococcus radiodurans  <cit> .

reca protein is a crucial dna dependent atpase involved in dna repair and homologous recombination. reca proteins are found in most microorganisms within the bacteria domain, but some insects' and clams' endocellular bacterial symbionts such as buchnera aphidicola aps, b. aphidicola sg, blochmannia floridanus, b. pennsylvanicus, wigglesworthia glossinidia, vesiomyosocius okutanii and ruthia magnifica lack the reca gene  <cit> . its analogues such as rada  <cit>  or rad <dig>  <cit>  are common in archaea and eucarya domains organisms. the product of the uvsx gene of the bacteriophage t <dig> also displays many reca-like properties  <cit> .

reca protein of e. coli, the best characterized reca, is a multifunctional protein involved in homologous recombination  <cit> , recombinational dna repair  <cit>  and sos response to dna damage and arrest of dna replication  <cit> . reca filaments on ssdna acts as a coprotease which facilitates the autoproteolysis of lexa protein. this results in the derepression of genes in the sos regulon  <cit> . reca coprotease activity also facilitates the autocatalytic cleavage of the umud protein to the activated umud', a component of dna polymerase v   <cit> . moreover reca nucleoprotein filament transfers reca-atp complex to polymerase v to form an active mutasome umud'2c-reca-atp which catalyzes translesion dna synthesis  <cit> .

in vitro, in the presence of mg2+ ions and atp, datp or nonhydrolyzable atp analogue atp-γ-s, reca assembles around single-stranded dna into a catalycally active helical filaments  <cit> . no atp or datp hydrolysis is needed for nucleoprotein filament formation, although these nucleotides are hydrolyzed by reca in the presence of ssdna  <cit> , during the disassembly of filaments  <cit> . the active reca filament is able to search out a homology between bound, single-stranded dna and double-stranded molecules, and catalyzes the homologous pairing of dna stands. these reactions also do not require cofactor hydrolysis and can occur in the presence of atp-γ-s  <cit> . the reca protein of e. coli promotes both three-strand exchange reaction between homologous ssdna and dsdna molecules, and four-strand exchange between a duplex dna with a single-stranded tail and a full dsdna, where the strand exchange reaction is initiated in the single-stranded region  <cit> . although homologous pairing and dna strand exchange can occur in the three-strand exchange reaction without atp hydrolysis  <cit> , atp hydrolysis renders reca protein-mediated dna strand exchange unidirectional . in the presence of atp-γ-s dna strand exchange is bidirectional and limited in extent  <cit> . moreover, atp hydrolysis allows a heterologous sequence bypass in one of the dna substrates  <cit> , and is indispensable in the four-strand exchange reaction  <cit> . in contrast to e. coli reca, the reca protein of d. radiodurans is able to promote the dna strand exchange through an inverse pathway, where the double-stranded dna is bound first and the homologous single-stranded dna second  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to clone, sequence and overexpress d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> and d. murrayi dsm  <dig> reca genes in e. coli. a biochemical characterization of recombinant dgereca and dmureca proteins was performed.

RESULTS
cloning, expression and purification of d. geothermalis and d. murrayi reca proteins
the primers for amplification of d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> reca gene were designed on the basis of the known reca gene sequence of d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> . the obtained pcr product was cloned into a pcr-blunt vector and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> reca gene is available from the genbank database under accession number ef <dig> 

the predicted dgereca monomer protein contains  <dig> amino acid residues. a homology search performed using a version  <dig> fasta programme at the ebi  revealed that the amino acid sequence of d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> reca shares 100% identity with d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> reca protein ,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with d. radiodurans r <dig> reca protein ,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with thermus aquaticus yt- <dig> reca protein ,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with t. thermophilus hb <dig> or t. thermophilus hb <dig> reca proteins ,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with meiothermus ruber dsm  <dig> reca protein ,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with m. silvanus dsm  <dig> reca protein , and  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with e. coli reca protein .

the d. murrayi dsm  <dig> reca gene sequence was obtained using a two step procedure. in first step, the internal fragment of the reca gene was amplified using degenerated primers designed on the basis of an alignment of reca gene sequences from bacteria belonging to the deinococcus-thermus group. in the second step, flanking regions were amplified by inverse pcr. the obtained partial sequences of the d. murrayi reca gene were then aligned and the primers for amplification of the gene were designed. afterwards, the pcr product was cloned using a clonejet™ pcr cloning kit and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of d. murrayi dsm  <dig> reca gene was deposited in the genbank database under accession number hm <dig> 

the dmureca protein contains  <dig> amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence of d. murrayi dsm  <dig> reca shows  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with d. geothermalis dsm  <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with d. radiodurans r <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with thermus aquaticus yt- <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with t. thermophilus hb <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with meiothermus ruber dsm  <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with t. thermophilus hb <dig> reca protein,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with m. silvanus dsm  <dig> reca protein, and  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity with e. coli reca protein. the multiple sequence alignment of reca proteins from bacteria of the genus deinococcus, thermus and meiothermus, and e. coli reca protein is shown in figure  <dig> 

in the next step, recombinant plasmids  were constructed. after reca gene expression in the e. coli blr  cells, dgereca protein was purified by heat treatment of lysate at 60°c for  <dig> min and ion exchange chromatography. in the case of purification of dmureca protein heat treatment was omitted due to its low thermostability. the purity of dgereca and dmureca proteins at every step of production and purification was checked by sds-page after coomassie brilliant blue r staining .

the applied overexpression and purification systems produced about  <dig> mg of dgereca and  <dig> mg of dmureca proteins from  <dig> l of e. coli culture.

analysis of the purified proteins by sds-page revealed major bands with a molecular mass of about  <dig> kda for both dgereca and dmureca proteins , which agreed with the amino acid sequence calculation;  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. summary of the purification process is shown in table  <dig> 

oligomeric states of dgereca and dmureca proteins
oligomeric states of dgereca and dmureca proteins at a concentration range between  <dig> and  <dig> μm in  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> m kcl were analyzed by gel filtration. the oligomeric states of examined proteins depend highly on their level of concentration. at high concentrations in solutions  both reca proteins exist as a heterogenous population of oligomeric forms ranging in size from dimers  to long protein filaments and highly aggregated structures . furthermore in such conditions, a greater percentage of dgereca and dmureca proteins exist as big oligomers, although in the case of dmureca significant amounts of dimers and trimers  were also present. at  <dig> and  <dig> μm concentrations both proteins eluted at volumes corresponding mainly to the small oligomers and probably monomers in the case of dmureca protein .

ssdna-binding properties
to determine the ability of dgereca and dmureca proteins to bind ssdna, we carried out agarose gel mobility assays with 5'-end fluorescein-labelled 35-oligonucleotides. the assays were carried out with increasing concentration of mg2+ ions and at various temperatures between  <dig> and 75°c. we observed, that ssdna binding by reca proteins was stimulated by mg2+ ions and was the most efficient at  <dig> and  <dig> mm mg2+ . dgereca was able to bind oligo <dig> at temperatures between  <dig> and 58°c while dmureca exhibited activity between  <dig> and  <dig> °c, although at the highest temperatures, 58°c for dgereca and  <dig> °c for dmureca, the ssdna binding was very slight .

dsdna-binding properties
we examined also the ability of reca proteins from d. geothermalis and d. murrayi to bind dsdna in the absence of magnesium ions and in the presence of  <dig> mm mg2+. both proteins were able to bind  <dig> bp pcr products and the dsdna binding was stimulated by mg2+ ions as well as in the case of ssdna binding . afterwards, to determine what kind of dna is more readily bound by dgereca and dmureca proteins we carried out the reactions where 5'-end fluorescein-labelled oligo <dig> and  <dig> bp pcr product were in the same test tube. when ssdna and dsdna were included in the reaction mixture, ssdna was bound preferentially by both reca proteins, both in the absence and presence of magnesium ions . we observed also that dmureca bound dsdna more efficient than dgereca in all conditions tested.

thermostability of dgereca and dmureca proteins
thermostability of reca proteins was characterized as the longest time period needed for complete loss of visible ssdna binding activity investigated by gel-mobility shift assay after incubation at given temperature. dgereca and dmureca were incubated at temperatures between  <dig> and 80°c for  <dig> s -  <dig> minutes, in the absence or in the presence of  <dig> mm mg2+. no significant loss of protein activity was observed after incubation at 50°c for  <dig> min. dgereca was also stable for  <dig> min at 57°c, while dmureca lost activity within  <dig> min at this temperature. both proteins incubated at higher temperatures displayed lower thermostability and at 80°c were completely inactivated in  <dig> s. the reca protein from d. geothermalis was more thermostable than reca from d. murrayi . moreover magnesium ions have no effect on the thermal stability neither dgereca nor dmureca.

atp and datp hydrolysis
atp and datp hydrolysis catalyzed by reca proteins from d. geothermalis and d. murrayi was monitored with a coupled spectrophotometric assay. we studied the dna and temperature dependence of dgereca and dmureca activity. we also measured the atpase activity of both proteins at various concentrations of atp and datp to determine their kinetic parameters.

we found no detectable atpase and datpase activities of dgereca and dmureca in the absence of dna and in the presence of dsdna only. both proteins however were able to hydrolyze atp and datp in the presence of ssdna and in the dna strand exchange conditions, although the rates of ssdna-dependent atp or datp hydrolysis were higher. furthermore, both proteins hydrolyzed datp more rapidly than atp either in the presence of ssdna or ssdna and dsdna in the same reaction mixture . the rates of ssdna-dependent atp and datp hydrolysis increased with temperature for both proteins and peaked at 42°c and 45°c for dmureca and dgereca, respectively . kinetic parameters for atpase and datpase activity of dgereca and dmureca proteins are displayed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>

dna strand exchange reactions
the ability of dgereca and dmureca proteins to promote dna strand exchange reaction was investigated in the presence of atp or datp, atp-regenerating system and dgessb protein , at 42°c for dmureca and 45°c for dgereca. at first, filaments composed of ssdna and reca protein were formed. afterwards, linear complementary dsdna was added to start dna strand exchange. after incubation and at various time periods, reactions were halted by protein degradation. as shown in figure  <dig>  dgereca and dmureca promoted homologous dna strand exchange either in the presence of atp or datp as evidenced by forming nicked circular dsdna products, although the products appeared earlier when reactions were performed with atp. moreover dna strand exchange occurred faster when dmureca was used. we also performed dna strand exchange reactions via an inverse pathway, where reca proteins were preincubated with the linear dsdna and circular ssdna was then added to initiate reactions, however we do not observe nicked circular dsdna products even after  <dig> min of incubation.

discussion
in this article, the cloning, purification and initial characterization of reca proteins from slightly thermophilic and extremely radioresistant bacteria d. geothermalis and d. murrayi are described. the dgereca and dmureca exhibit many properties common to this class of proteins. in the absence of dna both proteins self-assemble into a variety of oligomers, their size strongly depending on the concentration of protein in the solution, a characteristic of reca proteins. although oligomeric populations of t. aquaticus and t. thermophilus reca proteins contain a large percentage of hexamers  <cit> , it was impossible in our study to determine the preferred oligomeric state of dgereca and dmureca.

reca proteins of d. geothermalis and d. murrayi bind both ssdna and dsdna like other reca proteins. however, it was demonstrated that reca protein of d. radiodurans binds preferentially to double-stranded dna even when ssdna is present in the reaction mixture  <cit> . in contrast to drareca, dgereca and dmureca bind more readily to single-stranded dna when both ssdna and dsdna are in the same reaction mixture.

reca proteins of d. geothermalis and d. murrayi are dna-dependent atpases. in the absence of dna, atp or datp, hydrolysis was not detected. a similar result was demonstrated for d. radiodurans reca  <cit> . in contrast, atp hydrolysis in the absence of exogenous dna was detected for e. coli reca protein, although the rate was significantly reduced  <cit> . unlike drareca protein  <cit> , the dgereca and dmureca proteins were not able to perform atp or datp hydrolysis in the presence of dsdna at ph  <dig> . the same results were shown for t. thermophilus and e. coli reca proteins  <cit> , although ecoreca protein hydrolyses atp in the presence of dsdna at lower ph   <cit> . the atp and datp hydrolysis catalyzed by reca proteins of d. geothermalis and d. murrayi was stimulated by single-stranded dna, and datp was hydrolyzed faster than atp. these results are consistent with the results obtained for reca proteins of e. coli and d. radiodurans  <cit> .

both dgereca and dmureca as well as ecoreca and drareca were able to promote dna strand exchange using atp or datp as a cofactor  <cit> . however, in the presence of datp nicked circular heteroduplex products formed more slowly than in the presence of atp. similar results were also obtained for reca protein of d. radiodurans  <cit> .

the major difference between e. coli and d. radiodurans reca proteins is the ability to promote dna strand exchange using inverse pathways. the ecoreca initiates dna strand exchange with a filament bound to the ssdna, while the drareca binds dsdna first and homologous ssdna second  <cit> . in our study, we did not obtained the product of dna strand exchange reactions initiated with dgereca-dsdna or dmureca-dsdna filaments, although sghaier et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that reca protein of d. geothermalis is able to promote dna exchange reactions through normal and inverse pathways. the difference in results obtained by sghaier et al. and us may be due to differences in the conditions of the dna strand exchange reactions, especially the differences in the length of dsdna fragments used. in our study, we performed dna strand exchange reactions between full length linear m13mp <dig> dsdna  and circular m13mp <dig> ssdna, whereas sghaier et al. used a short fragment of Φx <dig> dsdna obtained by digestion with hincii endonuclease  and circular Φx <dig> ssdna .

reca proteins of d. geothermalis and d. murrayi are active at elevated temperatures similarly to reca of t. thermophilus. the optimum temperature for tthreca atpase activity is 65°c  <cit> , and for dgereca and dmureca proteins is  <dig> and 42°c, respectively. however, they are able to bind ssdna at temperatures reaching  <dig> °c for dmureca and 58°c for dgereca. moreover, the thermostability assay revealed that the dgereca and dmureca are less thermostable than tthreca which remains still active after a 10-s incubation at 85°c , whereas dgereca and dmureca are completely inactivated in  <dig> s at 80°c.

CONCLUSIONS
the properties of reca proteins of slightly thermophilic and extremely radioresistant bacteria d. geothermalis and d. murrayi obtained in this study demonstrate that they are close functional homologues of the other reca proteins. although it has previously been shown that the reca protein of the extremely radioresistant bacterium d. radiodurans exhibits some unusual properties, in our study we did not observe such properties in the case of dgereca and dmureca. this suggests the uniqueness of drareca even among reca proteins from microorganisms of the deinococcus genus. on the other hand, it has been also demonstrated that the dsdna-binding preferences displayed by drareca are not necessary for double-stranded breaks repair in γ-irradiated d. radiodurans. the rapid reconstruction of an intact genome occurring through an extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing process  followed by a dna recombination requires a 5'-3' single-stranded dna exonuclease recj, a recq helicase and a recf, reco and recr proteins to act together to promote loading of reca onto single-stranded dna  <cit> .
