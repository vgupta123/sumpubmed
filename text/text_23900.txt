BACKGROUND
a general question in microbiology is to understand the genetic determinants underlying a microbial phenotype, such as increased virulence or transmissibility. developments in sequencing technology now allow rapid identification of genetic differences among phenotypic variants, but it remains a time-consuming process to verify the function of each genetic variation by constructing isogenic strains  in which only one gene of interest differs. genomic diversity of existing microbial populations can be used to infer the consequences of polymorphisms by evaluating phenotypic differences between naturally occurring variants, if 1) the naturally occurring variants harbor the genetic variation of interest and 2) other known genetic determinants of the phenotypic difference can be accounted for. testing existing variants can reduce the amount of time and resources spent on constructing isogenic strains, so we hypothesized that using naturally occurring genomic diversity can accelerate gene function discovery.

streptococcus pneumoniae  is an important human pathogen that causes pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis and otitis media worldwide. pneumococcus frequently colonizes the human nasopharynx, which precedes invasive infections, and these colonization events serve as the reservoir for bacterial transmission  <cit> . there are more than  <dig> capsular serotypes of pneumococcus. simultaneous colonization by multiple serotypes and competition between serotypes has been documented during nasopharyngeal carriage in humans  <cit> . understanding the factors that determine serotype patterns of carriage is an important public health issue  <cit> . the capsule itself has a major impact on carriage: studies have shown that serotype controls resistance to surface killing mediated by human neutrophils  <cit> , ability to compete against co-colonizing strains in a mouse model of multiple-strain carriage , and pneumococcal cell surface charge  <cit> . all the three properties, in turn, are correlated with carriage prevalence in human populations  <cit> . for genetic variations outside the capsular polysaccharide synthesis  region, much less is known about their contribution to resistance to surface killing or ability to compete during nasopharyngeal colonization.

here we report an approach  that uses existing genomic diversity within a collection of carriage isolates, for which draft genomes are available, to accelerate the discovery of a novel, non-capsule genetic determinant of pneumococcal colonization. the project began during an experimental study of competitive colonization of mice by different strains of pneumococci, which had been constructed such that they were all of the tigr <dig> genetic background but differed at the cps locus, which determines serotype. a spontaneous variant of one of these strains, tigr4:19f , showed an unexpected but repeatable change of phenotype, specifically a reduced ability to colonize a mouse in the presence of competing strains, relative to the parental strain. we sequenced the whole genomes of the parental strain and the variant and identified  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  separating them. to improve the efficiency of the effort to identify which of these snps had caused the phenotypic change, we set out to evaluate the effect of sequence variation in genes that are affected by the snps by testing a related phenotype in pairs of isolates selected from a genomically sequenced collection of pneumococci carried by children in massachusetts. for each candidate gene, we sought pairs of isolates from the sequenced collection that  were serotype-matched, because serotype is a known determinant of competitive colonization;  diverged substantially at the candidate gene, and  were otherwise as similar genetically as possible. we hypothesized that within an isolate pair selected by these criteria, phenotypic differences could be reasonably attributed to sequence variations in the gene that differed substantially. after examining three such pairs, we found evidence supporting the role of variation in gene sp_ <dig>  a rela/spot homolog  protein involved in the stringent response . the sr globally regulates bacterial transcription, translation and replication in response to nutrient limitation and other stresses  <cit> . the rsh proteins in gram-positive bacteria catalyze the synthesis and degradation of guanosine tetraphosphate , which is a critical mediator of the stringent response  <cit> . the rela homolog protein in pneumococcus  was previously shown to modulate pneumococcal disease severity and course of progression in a mouse model of infection  <cit> . we confirmed the effect of the sp_1645:t1019c variation, one of the  <dig> snps separating tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig>  by evaluating the phenotypes in strains in which the sp_ <dig> alleles were exchanged. using a similar strategy, we found that variation in another rsh gene  contributes to change in resistance to neutrophil-killing. as collections of bacterial whole genome sequence data become larger, they will provide an increasingly valuable resource for targeting candidate genetic changes that cause phenotypic changes of interest.figure  <dig> a diagram summarizing the approach to use naturally existing variants in combination with sequencing of laboratory variants to accelerate the discovery of genetic variation underlying phenotypes of interest



RESULTS
a variant of pneumococcus with reduced fitness
we observed a variant of the tigr4:19f strain  showing reduced ability to compete against other strains during nasal colonization, compared to the originally constructed tigr4:19f . when co-colonizing c57bl/ <dig> mice together with  <dig> other strains , the spnyl <dig> strain showed significantly lower competitive index on day  <dig>  than did the originally constructed tigr4:19f strain . by day  <dig>  the competitive index of the spnyl <dig> strain was close to the lower limit of detection , which was significantly lower than the competitive index of the tigr4:19f strain . the results indicate that the spnyl <dig> strain is less likely to establish carriage in mice than the tigr4:19f strain in the presence of co-colonizers.figure  <dig> a variant of the tigr4:19f strain, spnyl <dig>  showed impaired colonization in a mouse model of multi-strain nasopharyngeal carriage and lower resistance to surface phagocytosis in vitro.
 in a mouse colonization model, five tigr <dig> capsular variants  were mixed with either tigr4:19f  or spnyl <dig>  at equal amount  and were used to intranasally challenge c57bl/ <dig> mice. nasal wash samples were obtained on days  <dig> and  <dig> post challenge, and the frequency of the serotype 19 f variant in each sample was determined by qpcr. the competitive index of the tigr4:19f or spnyl <dig> in each sample is shown. horizontal bars are medians. p-values are derived from mann–whitney tests.  survival rate of the tigr4:19f and the spnyl <dig> measured in a non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing assay. error bars represent sem. the p-value is derived from t-test .  cell-associated type 19 f capsular polysaccharide  measured by an inhibition elisa assay. error bars represent sem from two independent experiments. the p-value is derived from t-test.  single-strain colonization of c57bl/ <dig> mice by either tigr4:19f or spnyl <dig>  colonization densities as measured by total cfu/nasal wash on day  <dig> and day  <dig> are shown. horizontal bars are medians. p-values are derived from mann–whitney tests.



it has been reported that higher carriage prevalence of s. pneumoniae in human populations is associated with higher resistance to neutrophil-killing  <cit> . we therefore tested whether the spnyl <dig> strain is more likely to be killed by neutrophils than the tigr4:19f strain in a surface killing assay  <cit> . as shown in figure 2b, the survival of the spnyl <dig> strain  was significantly lower than that of the tigr4:19f strain  = − <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

decreased degree of encapsulation was shown to reduce s. pneumoniae resistance to non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing  <cit> . we therefore assessed whether the spnyl <dig> strain exhibited reduced capsule production compared to tigr4:19f. both strains were confirmed to remain serotype 19 f by pneumotest-latex serotyping. the cell-associated type 19 f capsular polysaccharide was quantified by an inhibition elisa assay, and no evidence of reduction in capsule production was observed for spnyl <dig> . furthermore, spnyl <dig> and tigr4:19f showed similar efficiency in colonizing c57bl/ <dig> mice in single-strain colonization experiment . thus, the spnyl <dig> strain appeared to have acquired non-capsule change that can affect both competition during co-colonization and resistance to surface phagocytosis. we measured the in vitro growth rates of spnyl <dig> and tigr4:19f in thy, and no statistically significant difference was observed .

genetic variations identified in the spnyl <dig> strain
we hypothesized that the phenotypic differences between the spnyl <dig> and the tigr4:19f strains were caused by genetic variation. to test this hypothesis, we sequenced the whole genome of the two strains using the illumina miseq system and compared the two genomes to identify snps distinguishing the two strains.

five snp sites were identified between the spnyl <dig> and the tigr4:19f genomes . four snp sites were located in coding sequences  and the other one was located in an intergenic region. four genes, with tigr <dig> locus tags sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig>  and sp_ <dig>  were affected by the four snps located in cds, respectively. consistent with our serotyping result, no snps were located in the cps locus that is responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis. in the sp_ <dig> locus, the snp did not alter the amino acid sequence encoded , and therefore it was not likely to cause a phenotypic difference. in contrast, in the sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig>  and sp_ <dig> loci, the snp caused a change in the translated amino acid sequence . these three single-nucleotide variations might explain the differing phenotypes of the tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig> strains.table  <dig>

testing the effects of snp with naturally existing diversity
to test whether variation in a candidate gene causes a phenotypic difference, classical genetic approaches involve creating a set of isogenic strains in which only the candidate gene differs and evaluating phenotypes among the set of isogenic strains. if multiple candidate genes were to be examined, multiple sets of isogenic strains would usually need to be constructed.

we sought to accelerate this process using a diverse collection of nasopharyngeal carriage isolates for which draft whole-genome sequences have previously been obtained  <cit> . we first examined whether genes affected by the non-synonymous snps between the spnyl <dig> and the tigr4:19f also vary in the carriage isolates. sequence variation was found for all the three genes affected by non-synonymous snps . for each target gene, we identified a pair of serotype-matched, closely-related isolates that differed substantially at the target gene . thus, each pair of carriage isolates mimicked a set of quasi-“isogenic” strains and was subsequently tested in the surface killing assay. comparatively little variation was found around the rest of the genome . as shown in figure 3b, no significant difference in resistance to neutrophil-killing was found between isolates  <dig> and nd <dig>  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ) or between isolates  <dig> and le <dig>  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ). in contrast, a significant difference in resistance to neutrophil-killing was found between isolates r34- <dig> and gl <dig>  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ). a whole genome alignment of this pair found only  <dig> sites at which these two isolates had different bases  <cit> . these results suggested that the sp_ <dig> variation might be a non-capsule determinant of resistance to neutrophil-killing.figure  <dig> evidence for the effects of variable genes between tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig> in carriage isolates.  for each gene that contained a non-synonymous substitution between tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig>  we identified a pair of carriage isolates that are serotype-matched, closely related, but differ substantially in the target gene alleles, such that phenotypic differences within the pair could be reasonably attributed to allelic variations in the target gene.  the carriage isolates were subjected to the non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing assay. mean survival rates are shown . error bars represent sem. the p-values were derived from t-tests.



the sp_ <dig> c1019t variation in spnyl <dig> contributes to its defects
to confirm whether the sp_1645:c1019t variation in spnyl <dig> decreases the resistance to neutrophil-killing in vitro, we first replaced the sp_ <dig> locus in both the tigr4:19f and the spnyl <dig> by a janus cassette to knock out the gene function. unlike the parental strains, the sp_1645-knock out strains showed no significant difference in survival from neutrophil-killing  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). the results suggested that the sp_ <dig> gene is necessary for this phenotypic difference between tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig>  subsequently, we switched the alleles the sp_ <dig> locus between the tigr4:19f and the spnyl <dig> strains by transforming the sp_1645-knock out strains of tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig> with alleles amplified from the sp_ <dig> locus of spnyl <dig> and tigr4:19f, respectively. the resulting two strains, spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig>  were subjected to the surface killing assay . the survival of spnyl <dig>  was significantly lower than that of spnyl <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). the results indicated that the allele in the sp_ <dig> locus of the spnyl <dig> strain is sufficient to confer reduced resistance to neutrophil-killing in vitro.figure  <dig> the sp_1645:c1019t variation leads to lower resistance to surface phagocytosis in vitro and impaired competitiveness in vivo.  the tigr4:19f strain exhibited higher resistance to neutrophil-mediated killing than the spnyl <dig> strain . the sp_ <dig> gene was replaced by a janus cassette in the tigr4:19f and the spnyl <dig>  and the resulting sp_1645- knock out strains showed no significant difference in resistance to neutrophil-killing . the tigr4:19f strain carrying sp_ <dig> 1019 t allele  was less resistant to neutrophil- killing than did the spnyl <dig> strain carrying the sp_ <dig> 1019c allele . error bars represent sem. the p-values were derived from t-tests .  competitive index of the spnyl <dig>  and the spnyl <dig>  relative to a capsular variant of the tigr <dig>  as the reference strain. data on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-challenge are shown. the horizontal bars are medians. p-values are derived from mann–whitney tests.



since the sp_ <dig> snp caused a change in resistance to neutrophil-killing, we hypothesized that the sp_1645:c1019t variation also contributes to the ability to establish nasal colonization. to test this hypothesis, a reference strain  was mixed with either spnyl <dig> or spnyl <dig> at equal ratio and the mixtures were used to intranasally challenge c57bl/ <dig> mice. nasal wash samples were collected on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-challenge, and the competitive index was measured as described in materials and methods. the spnyl <dig> and the spnyl <dig> showed similar competitive index on day  <dig> . by day  <dig>  the spnyl <dig> strain showed a slightly higher competitive index  than was observed for the spnyl <dig>  and the difference was significant . by day  <dig> of colonization, the competitive index for the spnyl <dig> strain  was significantly higher than that of the spnyl <dig> strain . the results indicated that the sp_1645:c1019t variation is an important determinant of pneumococcal competitiveness during nasal colonization in the mouse.

effects of variation in other genes involved in the stringent response pathway
the sp_ <dig> gene product belongs to the rela/spot homolog proteins mediating the stringent response . it is of interest to understand the role of the pneumococcal sr pathway in colonization success. we hypothesized that naturally existing genomic diversity can provide information on the effects of variation in other sr genes. three putative pneumococcal sr genes  were identified according to the kegg orthology database . for each putative sr gene, we identified a pair of serotype-matched, closely-related isolates that differ substantially at the target gene  and evaluated their survival from surface phagocytosis . no significant difference in survival from surface phagocytosis was found between isolates le <dig> and le <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). in contrast, a significant difference in resistance to neutrophil-killing was found between isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ) and between isolates  <dig> and nd <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the results suggested that variation in specific stringent response genes was associated with change in resistance to neutrophil-killing.figure  <dig> evidence for variation of specific stringent response genes associated with change in resistance to neutrophil-killing.  pneumococcal genes assumed to be involved in the stringent response pathway were identified by searching the kegg orthology groups that contain stringent response genes in e.coli . to test the effects of sequence variation in a target gene, a pair of pneumococcal carriage isolates that are serotype-matched, closely related, but differ substantially at the target gene were identified.  the carriage isolates were subjected to the non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing assay. mean survival rates are shown . error bars represent sem. the p-values were derived from t-tests.



sp_ <dig> is the only other gene in the tigr <dig> genome that encodes a putative gtp pyrophosphokinase  in addition to sp_ <dig>  gtp pyrophosphokinase activity could influence the level of guanosine tetraphosphate , which is the upstream mediator of sr and controls other downstream sr effectors. we therefore wanted to test whether the difference between alleles corresponding to sp_ <dig> in  <dig> and nd <dig>  causes changes in resistance to neutrophil-killing. we constructed two isogenic strains, spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig> , in which the sp_ <dig> locus in the tigr4:6b was replaced by alleles corresponding to sp_ <dig> in  <dig> and nd <dig>  respectively. consistent with what was observed for carriage isolates  <dig> and nd <dig>  the spnyl <dig> showed a significantly higher survival than the spnyl <dig>  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ). we also estimated the in vitro growth rate for both strains by fitting growth curves to an exponential growth equation. the spnyl <dig> showed a significantly higher in vitro growth rate than the spnyl <dig>  =  <dig> , p < <dig> ). to test whether the sp_ <dig> snp influences colonization in vivo, the competitive indexes of spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig> were measured as described in materials and methods. among mice that remained detectably colonized by at least one strain, spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig> showed similar competitive indexes on both day  <dig> and day  <dig> .figure  <dig> mutation in sp_ <dig> results in higher resistance to surface phagocytosis and higher growth rate in vitro.  the sp_ <dig> locus in the tigr4:6b strain was replaced by a kanamycin resistance marker  fused to the allele corresponding to sp_ <dig> from either strain  <dig> or strain nd <dig> to construct the spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig> strains, respectively. the vertical black bar indicates the only snp between the two alleles .  survival rate of the spnyl <dig> and the spnyl <dig> strains measured in a non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing assay. error bars represent sem. the p-value is derived from t-test .  growth rate of the spnyl <dig> and the spnyl <dig> strains. the strains were cultured in thy medium at 37°c and the increase in o.d.  <dig> was measured for 6 hours. the increase in o.d. was fitted to an exponential growth to estimate the growth rate. error bars represent sem. the p-value is derived from t-test .



discussion
in this study, we observed phenotypic differences between the tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig> strains. we sequenced the whole genomes of the two strains and identified  <dig> snps as the candidate causes of the phenotypic differences. subsequently, we prioritized hypotheses about the likely roles of genetic variation in genes affected by a snp by testing a pair of serotype-matched, closely-related carriage isolates that differs substantially at each candidate gene. such isolate pairs were identified by genomic analysis of a large collection of carriage isolates with diverse genetic background and evidence was found to support the phenotypic impact of variation in the gene with tigr <dig> locus tag sp_ <dig>  although it would be ideal to compare closely-related isolate pairs that harbor the exact same snp of interest, such pairs may not always be available for a given collection . additionally, this method aims to make the best use of the available genomic diversity information to complement  traditional genetics approaches and accelerate genotype-phenotype analysis. it could be inappropriate if the distance between the most closely related strains happens to be quite large because more genomic changes would make it difficult to evaluate the contribution from a specific gene variation. we also acknowlodge that serotype matching may not be as informative for other studies. as each pair of isolates came from the same ‘sequence cluster’, there is unlikely to be much relevant accessory genome variation distinguishing them  <cit> , making it unlikely that the differences in phenotypes are down to other genetic variation, althogh such differences cannot be formally ruled out. we therefore emphasize that the method is complementary to, rather than a direct replacement for, experimental work that can identify the causal genetic variant underlying phenotypic differences. finally, we confirmed the effects of the sp_1645:c1019t variation by using laboratory-constructed isogenic strains. notably, the tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig> strains became similarly susceptible to neutrophil-killing when the sp_ <dig> locus was knocked out from both strains . this result indicated that the other  <dig> snps were unlikely to play a major role in resistance to neutrophil-killing.

little is known about the cellular function of the sp_1645:c1019t variation we identified. when the sp_ <dig> locus in the tigr4:19f strain was replaced by the janus cassette, no significant change in resistance to neutrophil-killing was observed. this is consistent with results in a previous transposon mutagenesis study  <cit> , also using variants of tigr <dig> , that disruption of the sp_ <dig> locus by transposon insertions did not cause a detectable defect in pneumococcal colonization of mouse nasopharynx. in contrast, replacing the sp_ <dig> locus in the spnyl <dig> strain by janus cassette significantly increased resistance to neutrophil-killing, restoring it to a level similar to that seen in the tigr4:19f strain. this observation suggested that the sp_ <dig> allele in spnyl <dig> could represent a gain-of-function change in which the gained function appeared to associate with reduced resistance to surface killing. since it has been shown that surface charge of pneumococcus influences its resistance to neutrophil-killing  <cit> , we measured the zeta potential of the tigr4:19f, spnyl <dig>  and the sp_ <dig> knock-out strains, and did not find a significant difference in surface charge among them. in addition, the protein encoded by the sp_ <dig> gene was not in a previously reported list of human antibody antigens  <cit>  or a list of human th- <dig> cell antigens  <cit> . thus, the sp_1645:c1019t variation could represent a previously unknown determinant that, directly or indirectly, influences the interaction between pneumococcus and neutrophils.

the gene with tigr <dig> locus tag sp_ <dig> is inferred to encode a rela/spot homolog protein, which is involved in the synthesis and degradation of guanosine tetraphosphate . in bacteria, ppgpp is a stringent-response mediator that coordinates cellular activities in response to changes in nutrient abundance  <cit> . we therefore tested the effects of variation in other genes involved in the stringent response pathway using, once again, naturally existing genomic diversity. interestingly, evidence suggested that variation in another rela/spot homolog protein encoded by the gene with tigr <dig> locus tag is also associated with change in resistance to neutrophil-killing. construction and testing isogenic strains further confirmed the causal effects of the snp in the gene with tigr <dig> locus tag sp_ <dig>  these data suggested that rela/spot homolog proteins in pneumococcus could play a critical role in regulating bacterial responses to neutrophil-killing. interestingly, no significant difference in competitiveness against spnyl <dig> observed between spnyl <dig> and spnyl <dig> in the mouse colonization experiment . the results indicated that, consistent with previous studies  <cit> , resistance to phagocytic killing is an important but not the only mechanism to regulate pneumococcal colonization ability. it should be noted that mouse colonization in vivo and surface phagocytosis killing in vitro are two complementary, relevant, if imperfect model systems we used to understand the pneumococcal determinants of colonization success in human populations. more studies using a variety of approaches are needed to dissect the possible links between activities of gtp pyrophosphokinase , levels of stringent response, and pneumococcal colonization success.

the increasing availability of large, publicly available genomic datasets, combined with relatively inexpensive sequencing of laboratory variants, provides a wealth of information that can be mined for polymorphisms with interesting phenotypic consequences. in addition to whole genome sequences, databases on transcriptomics, proteomics, protein structure, and specific functions  could also be mined to obtain information on potential role of the targets, and therefore help focusing on genetic variations of high likelihood of functional consequences. the approach used here requires access to enable us to search such data for suitably matched, closely related isolates distinguished by the polymorphism of interest, and then to the selected isolates themselves for phenotypic evaluation. in this study we used carriage isolates to which we already had access and their whole genome sequences, which are not trivial to obtain. in order to facilitate more general use at the public level, affordable publicly funded repositories  should be supported. the option to use an in silico search of genomic sequence database to identify comparable isolates in which the snp has already occurred in the course natural evolution can be far more efficient than constructing an isogenic mutant in vitro. this method allows us to quickly screen multiple snps and narrow down a candidate list to those with high likelihood of causing a phenotypic difference. the same procedure can be applied to studying the effect of genetic variation in other microorganisms for which collections of diverse isolates and their full-genome sequences are available. it will be particularly useful when gene replacement and creation of isogenic strains are difficult to achieve, such as in studies of essential genes or microorganisms with low recombination rate. given the fast growing database of whole genome sequencing data for many different organisms  <cit> , a method that uses naturally existing diversity of microbial populations to accelerate gene function analysis could be increasingly feasible for a wide range of microorganisms. in addition, as these databases grow the chance of sampling closely related isolates that differ at the locus of interest will grow with them. to the extent isolates  are available with genomic sequences, it will then be possible to go one step further, evaluating the extent to which genetic differences experimentally proven to cause phenotypic traits in laboratory strains are correlated with these traits in natural populations, where genetic backgrounds will be more variable. analogous to testing animal model results in human populations by epidemiological studies, such surveys of natural genetic and phenotypic variation will provide a much fuller picture of the significance of laboratory findings.

CONCLUSIONS
a single nucleotide change in pneumococcal rela/ spot homolog involved in the stringent response  was identified to reduce the ability of pneumococcus to compete for colonization and decrease the resistance to killing by human neutrophils. the identification process was shown to benefit from a strategy that includes analyzing  <dig> previously published pneumococcal genome sequences to select closely-related strains carrying genetic variation of interest for phenotypic evaluation. the utility of this strategy was additionaly demonstrated by identifing variation in another rela/ spot homolog  that causes change in resistance to neutrophil-killing. we conclude that analysis of naturally occurring genome diversity can be used to complement traditional genetics approaches to accelerate the genotype-phenotype analysis.
