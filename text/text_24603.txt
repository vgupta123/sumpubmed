BACKGROUND
wnt ligands are a family of secreted cysteine-rich signaling molecules that play critical roles in many cell activities, including cell fate determination, cell adhesion, cell migration and cell polarity. several pathways have been identified that mediate wnt signaling. the most extensively studied of these, the beta-catenin-dependent, otherwise known as the canonical wnt pathway is activated through stabilization of beta-catenin, followed by beta-catenin nuclear-localization and activation of target genes by beta-catenin-lef/tcf complex  <cit> . wnt ligands also stimulate beta-catenin-independent, or the non-canonical wnt pathways that include the planer cell polarity , and the wnt/ca2+ pathways. the pcp pathway is mediated by activation of rhoa and jnk, and the wnt/ca2+ pathway leads to activation of protein kinase c , calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase ii  or calcineurin   <cit> .

to activate the intracellular pathways, wnt ligands interact with seven-span transmembrane receptor molecules known as frizzled , and the co-receptors from the family of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins . fzd proteins contain a cysteine-rich domain  in their n-terminal extracellullar region, which interacts with wnt ligands. to date,  <dig> wnt ligands,  <dig> fzds and  <dig> lrps have been described in human tissues. different combinations of wnt and fzds lead to differential responses. for example, wnt5a can activate or inhibit the canonical wnt signaling depending on the availability of specific receptors  <cit> . recently, studies on the mechanism of wnt signaling suggested that coupling of fzd and lrp triggers the activation of the canonical wnt pathway  <cit> .

ror <dig>  a member of the ror family of receptor-tyrosine kinases , was first identified as a receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor. ror <dig> is a single-span transmembrane receptor that contains a crd domain in the extracellular region. the c-terminal intracellular region of ror <dig> contains a tyrosine kinase domain  and a proline-rich domain  flanked by two ser/thr rich domains   <cit> . the prd of ror <dig> associates with casein kinase 1Îµ  which catalyzes phosphorylation of ror <dig> at s/t <dig>  this in turn leads to ror <dig> auto-phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in prd  <cit> . targeted deletion of ror <dig> gene resulted in abnormal skeletal, genital and cardiovascular development  <cit> . the potential role of ror <dig> in wnt signaling has been the focus of many recent studies. for example, the ror <dig> crd domain has been shown to interact with wnt ligands and the crd domain of fzd <dig>  <cit> . minami and his colleagues first demonstrated that ror <dig> mediates wnt5a-induced activation of the non-canonical pathway  <cit> . subsequently, ror <dig> was found to mediate the inhibitory effect of wnt5a on wnt3a-mediated activation of the canonical wnt pathway  <cit> . more recently, ror <dig> was shown to be critical for filopodia formation during cell migration, a process dependent on wnt5a. knowledge on the role of ror <dig> in canonical wnt signaling is limited. to date, one study has reported potentiation of wnt <dig> by ror <dig> in activating the canonical wnt pathway in osteoblastic cells  <cit> .

wnt signaling plays important roles in lung development and lung cancer  <cit> . we have shown that wnt5a is a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during lung development. lungs from wnt5a  and transgenic embryos that over-express wnt5a specifically in lung epithelial cells are abnormal in branching morphogenesis and lung maturation  <cit> . targeted inactivation of wnt7b disrupts mesenchymal proliferation and vascular development in the lung  <cit> . studies on wnt inhibitor, dickkopf- <dig> , suggested that wnt signaling controls fibronectin deposition during branching morphogenesis of the lung  <cit> .

to further understand the mechanism of wnt signaling in the lung, we analyzed it in a lung carcinoma h <dig> cell line, which as we found in this report, has low levels of fzd expression. we show that in h <dig> cells, ror <dig> moderately enhances activation of canonical wnt pathway by wnt3a. also, ror <dig> specifically cooperates with fzd <dig> but not fzd <dig> in mediating wnt3a-stimulation of the canonical wnt pathway. the cooperative function between ror <dig> and fzd <dig> is dependent on the crd, but independent of the prd domain of ror <dig>  furthermore, we demonstrate that lrp5/ <dig> is also critical for the cooperative function of ror <dig> and fzd <dig>  suggesting that ror <dig> functions as a cofactor to facilitate fzd <dig> and lrp5/6-mediated activation of the canonical wnt signaling pathway.

RESULTS
activation of the canonical pathway by wnt3a in lung epithelial cell lines
wnt signaling plays important roles during lung development  <cit>  and in non-small-cell lung cancer  <cit> . to understand its mechanism, we examined wnt signaling in two lung carcinoma, a <dig> and h <dig> cell lines. both cell lines were transiently transfected with the canonical wnt signaling reporter supertopflash, stf, that contains the luciferase coding region driven by a minimal ta viral promoter, plus eight lef/tcf response elements. these cells were then treated with either wnt3a- or wnt5a-conditioned media . these conditioned media have been previously used as a source of recombinant wnt ligands  <cit> . as positive control, an identical experiment was conducted in l cells, in which both wnt3a and wnt5a have been shown to function in regulating stf activity  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  wnt3a stimulated stf activity in both l cells and in a <dig> cells. in contrast, only a low level of stf response to wnt3a was observed in h <dig> cells. we also used an experimental approach previously used by mikels and nusse  <cit>  to determine the activity of wnt5a by examining its ability to antagonize wnt3a-mediated stf response. this antagonistic effect was shown to be enhanced by the presence of ror <dig>  <cit> . in all three cell lines, stimulation of stf by wnt3a was antagonized by wnt5a in presence of ror <dig> . unexpectedly, in both l cells and h <dig> cells, presence of ror <dig> enhanced wnt3a-stimulated stf activity. thus, the results of these experiments show that: 1) the canonical wnt signaling pathway as assessed by the magnitude of response to wnt3a-stimulated stf activation is significantly reduced in h <dig> cells compared to l cells or a <dig> cells and 2) ror <dig> may positively modulate the canonical wnt signaling in l and h <dig> cells.

low level frizzled expression in h <dig> cells
one potential mechanism by which the "low responsiveness" of h <dig> cells to wnt3a or wnt5a may be explained is the lack of appropriate receptors. therefore, we examined the expression of all  <dig> fzd molecules and some of the wnt related membrane-associated cofactors in a <dig> and h <dig> cells by rt-pcr analysis. for comparison, we also examined the expression of these molecules in human lung tissue. since many fzd genes,  do not contain intronic sequences, the products from the reverse-transcription reactions without adding reverse-transcriptase  were used as negative controls in each pcr amplification to eliminate the possibility of genomic dna contamination. as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the fzds, except fzd <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in human lung. fzd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are detectable in a <dig> cells. fzds not detected in human lung were also not expressed in a <dig> cells. expression of fzds in l cells was determined previously  <cit> . fzds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in l cells. interestingly, in h <dig> cells, expression of fzds was nearly undetectable. only weak bands were observed corresponding to fzds <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  no product was amplified when samples without rt were used in pcr reactions . expression patterns of other wnt related transmembrane molecules such as lrp <dig>  lrp <dig>  ror <dig> and ror <dig> were similar between a <dig> and h <dig> cells, while level of krm <dig> in h <dig> appeared much lower than in a <dig> cells. therefore, h <dig> cells express not only fewer types of fzds but also at reduced levels, which may explain the absence or reduced response of these cells to wnt3a ligand. these characteristics distinguish h <dig> as a useful lung epithelial cell model to study wnt ligand-receptor interactions and signaling.

transient fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> augmentation enhances h <dig> responsiveness to wnt3a
the latter observations suggested that low level expression of endogenous fzd receptors might be responsible for the low-responsiveness of h <dig> cells to wnt3a and wnt5a signaling. to validate this possibility, we transiently expressed fzd  <dig> and fzd <dig>  two receptors shown to mediate wnt3a signaling in  <dig> cells  <cit> , along with stf in h <dig> cells. transfected cells were then treated with wnt3a- or wnt5a-conditioned media. in comparison to controls, transfected h <dig> cells responded strongly to wnt3a stimulation as demonstrated by the magnitude of stf activation . in contrast, transient transfection of a fzd <dig> expression construct failed to establish or enhance wnt3a responsiveness in h <dig> cells. none of the transfected fzds activated stf by wnt5a . ror <dig> is known to mediate the non-canonical wnt signaling and the antagonistic effect of wnt5a on canonical wnt signaling. however, in figure  <dig> we found that ror <dig> enhanced the wnt3a-stimulated stf activation in both l and h <dig> cell lines. to confirm this observation, we treated h <dig> cells transfected with ror <dig> expression constructs with wnt3a-conditioned medium for different time periods. as shown in figure  <dig>  ror <dig> moderately potentiated stimulation of stf when h <dig> cells were treated with wnt3a for durations from  <dig> hrs to  <dig> hrs. ror <dig> slightly enhanced stf stimulation when h <dig> cells were treated for  <dig> hours.

fzd <dig> and ror <dig> cooperate to mediate wnt3a-activation of the canonical wnt pathway
to further determine the role of ror <dig> in the canonical wnt pathway, we transfected h <dig> cells with ror <dig>  plus fzd <dig> or fzd <dig> expression constructs and treated the transfected cells with wnt3a conditioned medium. as shown in figure  <dig>  ror <dig> alone lead to nearly a  <dig> fold increase in wnt3a-stimulated stf response, while fzd <dig> alone stimulated a  <dig> fold increase. interestingly, combination of fzd <dig> and ror <dig> resulted in a significant further increase in stf response. in contrast, although fzd <dig> alone mediated similar level of wnt3a-stimulated stf response as fzd <dig>  co-transfected ror <dig> with fzd <dig> failed to further increase the level of response . similar levels of ror <dig> expression were observed by western blot analysis in cells transfected with ror <dig> alone, ror <dig> plus fzd <dig>  or ror <dig> plus fzd <dig> . the affinity of ror <dig> to fzd <dig> crd domain is significantly higher than that of fzd <dig> crd domain . to further determine the cooperative effects between fzd <dig> and ror <dig>  we performed the transfection assay with increasing doses of ror <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the levels of stf response to wnt3a increased in response to increased doses of ror <dig>  suggesting cooperation between ror <dig> and fzd <dig> inwnt3a-stimulated stf activity. also shown in figure  <dig>  ror <dig> alone can also lead to moderate activation of stf by wnt3a. these observations suggest that 1) ror <dig> positively modulates activation of the canonical wnt pathway and 2) ror <dig> cooperatively enhances fzd <dig> but not fzd <dig> in this reaction. the latter functions of ror <dig> and fzd <dig> were also observed when purified recombinant wnt3a protein  was used .

cooperative function of ror <dig> and fzd <dig> is dependent on ror <dig> crd domain, but independent of ror <dig> prd domain
to determine which of the ror <dig> domains is involved in the cooperative function of ror <dig> and fzd <dig>  we used several ror <dig> mutants that lack specific functional domains. oishi et al  <cit>  has demonstrated that fzd <dig> and ror <dig> physically interact with each other through their crd domains. ror2-dcrd lacks the crd domain and hence is unable to interact with fzd <dig> crd  <cit> . to determine whether the cooperative function of ror <dig> is dependent on its crd domain, we conducted the latter experiments with ror2-dcrd. as expected, ror2-dcrd failed to fully cooperate with fzd <dig> in mediating wnt3a-stimulated stf response, suggesting that interaction with the crd domain is important for the cooperative function between ror <dig> and fzd <dig>  however, deletion of the crd domain did not completely abolish the cooperative effect of ror <dig>  ror <dig> also contains a proline-rich domain, prd, localized to the intracellular region of the molecule. prd is important in phosphorylation of g protein-coupled receptor kinase  <dig>  <cit>  and ror2-mediated cell migration  <cit> . interestingly, ror2-bdb , an ror <dig> mutant that lacks the prd domain and the ser/thr rich domains flanking prd, functioned even more efficiently than the wild-type ror <dig>  suggesting that the ser/thr rich domains and the prd domain are not required for cooperating with fzd <dig>  further experiments using the mutant ror2-dk construct that lacks the tyr-kinase activity by amino acid substitution  <cit>  showed that the tyrosine kinase activity of the ror <dig> intracellular region does not affect fzd2-ror <dig> cooperativity . however, fzd2-ror <dig> cooperation was entirely abolished by using ror2-tc, a mutant which lacks the entire intracellular domain of ror <dig>  relative level of ror <dig> mutant peptides in h <dig> cell membrane was determined by western blot .

fzd2-ror <dig> mediated activation of stf by wnt3a is inhibited by dkk1-krm <dig> and gsk3
to further determine if ror <dig> potentiates wnt3a-activation of stf through activation of canonical wnt signaling, we examined whether lrps are required. we first performed transfection assays with sirnas that specifically target lrp <dig>  specificity of the lrp <dig> sirnas was determined by western blot analysis . as shown in figure 10a lrp <dig> sirnas almost completely abolished the wnt3a-activation of stf by ror <dig> alone and reduced the response mediated by fzd <dig> alone or fzd <dig> and ror <dig> combination by 70% and 80%, respectively. to block the function of lrp5/ <dig> more broadly, we performed transfection assays with an lrp5/ <dig> specific inhibitor, dkk <dig>  and its cofactor, kremen <dig>   <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  dkk <dig> and krm <dig> almost entirely inhibited stf activity in presence of ror <dig> or fzd <dig>  similar levels  of inhibition by dkk <dig> and krm <dig> were observed for fzd2-ror2-mediated stf stimulation. activation of the canonical wnt signaling through fzd-lrp5/ <dig> can also be inhibited intracellularly by gsk3beta. gsk3beta binds to apc and axin to facilitate beta-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. when a xenopus gsk- <dig>  , expression plasmid was used in the cotransfection studies, wnt3a-stimulated stf response decreased significantly in h <dig> cells transfected with either ror <dig> alone, fzd <dig> alone or fzd <dig> plus ror <dig> . thus, the sum of these results is consistent with a model in which ror <dig> potentiates fzd2-lrp5/ <dig> in mediating wnt3a stimulation of the canonical wnt signaling.

discussion
in this study, we report that ror <dig> positively modulates the canonical wnt signaling in mammalian cells. this function occurs through cooperation with fzd <dig> and requires the crd domain and the cytoplasmic domain of ror <dig>  however, unlike other activities of ror <dig>  its interaction with fzd <dig> in mediating canonical wnt signaling is independent of its prd domain. furthermore, the cooperative effect of ror <dig> and fzd <dig> is subject to inhibition by dkk <dig> and krm <dig>  which indicates that ror <dig> potentiates fzd <dig> and lrp5/6-mediated activation of the canonical wnt signaling pathway.

wnt signaling involves multiple mediators within a macromolecular complex and multilayered network of interactions. at the receptor level,  <dig> fzds, two lrps and members of the receptor tyrosine kinase  family mediate the signal from  <dig> wnt ligands  <cit> . to understand the mechanism of wnt signaling, much of the studies have utilized cell lines that readily respond to wnt ligands and express high levels of endogenous fzds. however, it is likely that high endogenous fzds may complicate the interpretation of experimental results and mask the low affinity interactions at the receptor level. to avoid interference from endogenous fzds, studies have employed drosophila s <dig> cells, which exhibit low level fzd expression  <cit> . since wnt signaling in mammalian cells is comparatively more complicated, a mammalian cell line with low fzd background would provide a useful model for deciphering the complex mechanisms of signaling at the receptor level. we show for the first time that the human lung carcinoma h <dig> cell line represents a unique model with low-level endogenous fzd expression. in addition, transient expression of fzd cdna alone is sufficient to establish robust wnt pathway responsiveness to wnt3a as assayed by stf activation. thus, h <dig> cells provide a unique and useful cell model to investigate wnt signaling.

the role of ror <dig> in wnt5a-mediated activation of the non-canonical pathways has been well established. these include activation of jnk  <cit> , inhibition of wnt3a-stimulated canonical pathway  <cit> , as well as mediation of wnt5a-induced cell migration  <cit> . the current study revealed the role of ror <dig> in the canonical pathway. using h <dig> cells, the results of our studies clearly demonstrate that ror <dig> specifically cooperates with fzd <dig>  but not fzd <dig> to mediate wnt3a stimulation of the canonical pathway. physical interactions between fzd <dig> and the n-terminal extracellular crd domain of ror <dig> were recently reported  <cit> . this domain also interacts with wnt5a  <cit>  and is required for ror2-mediated cell migration  <cit> . the proline-rich, prd domain of ror <dig> associates with casein kinase 1Îµ  which catalyzes phosphorylation of ror <dig> at ser/thr rich domain, . this in turn leads to ror <dig> auto-phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in prd  <cit> . the prd domain is important for phosphorylating g protein-coupled receptor kinase  <dig>  <cit>  as well as ror2-mediated cell migration  <cit> . the c-terminal intracellular region of ror <dig> is also required for enhancing wnt5a mediated inhibition of canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . in the current study we found that the prd and the s/t domains are not necessary for cooperative function with fzd <dig> in mediating canonical wnt signaling. an ror <dig> mutant construct that lacks the prd and s/t domains functions even more efficiently in its cooperation with fzd <dig>  this indicates that although prd and s/t domains are critical for non-canonical wnt signaling in mammalian cells  <cit> , they are not required for activating canonical wnt signaling through cooperation with fzd <dig> 

the sum of the observations outlined above demonstrates ror <dig> as a positive modulator of the canonical wnt signaling at least within a particular context. in this light, ror <dig> can be deemed as a key "dual" or multi-functional membrane protein along the wnt signal transduction pathway in mammalian cells. this multi-functionality is not uncommon for factors participating in wnt signaling. for example, wnt5a can activate or inhibit the canonical wnt signaling depending on the presence of fzd <dig> or ror <dig>  respectively  <cit> . members of the dishevelled family  can mediate either canonical or non-canonical wnt pathways. the c-terminal dep domain of dvl is essential for activating pcp pathway, while both n-terminal dix domain and the c-terminal dep domain of dvl are required for activating canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . a similar functional feature was also found in ryk, a new member of the wnt signaling pathway. during mammalian central nervous system development ryk-wnt  interactions mediate chemorepulsive axon guidance, possibly through the beta-catenin independent pcp pathway  <cit> . ryk can also mediate the wnt3a stimulated activation of beta-catenin/tcf pathway in 293t cells  <cit> .

previous studies have established that the coupling of lrp and fzds through their extracellular domains with wnt ligands stimulates the canonical or beta-catenin pathway  <cit> . upon activation of the wnt pathway, the intracellular domain of lrp <dig> is phosphorylated by gsk <dig> and casein kinase  <dig>  which provides a docking site for axin to the cell membrane  <cit> . removing axin from the cytoplasmic complex of apc/axin/gsk <dig> leads to stabilization of beta-catenin. as one of the potential mechanisms of ror <dig> in modulating canonical wnt signaling, ror <dig> may interact with fzd <dig> which couples with lrp5/ <dig> in presence of wnt3a. this hypothesis is partially supported by the following observations: first, the ror2-fzd cooperative function occurs with fzd <dig> but not fzd <dig>  even though individually they mediate similar levels of wnt3a stimulation of stf, suggesting that specific fzds  must be present. secondly, both the function of ror <dig> alone and the cooperative function of ror <dig> and fzd <dig> are sensitive to lrp5/ <dig> specific inhibitors, dkk <dig> and krm <dig>  thirdly, ror <dig> physically interacts with fzd <dig> through their crd domain  and cooperative function of ror <dig> and fzd <dig> was greatly reduced by deletion of the ror <dig> crd domain. this model requires further verification by showing directly the formation of ror2/fzd2/wnt3a/lrp complex in cell membrane.

the ror <dig> function may be subject to regulation by multiple other factors. for example, when high levels of wnt5a are present, ror <dig> binds to wnt5a to mediate the non-canonical wnt signaling or inhibit the beta-catenin pathway  <cit> . also, since not all fzds cooperate with ror <dig> in activating the canonical wnt pathway , the positive function of ror <dig> may be dependent on which fzd functions as the major receptor in a given cell line. and this is further dependent on the trafficking of fzds to cell membrane and the affinity of each fzd for a given wnt ligand. finally, ror <dig> function may be subject to the activity of as yet unknown inhibitors. all of the latter may contribute to a potential explanation for the observation that in a <dig> cells ror <dig> failed to further stimulate the canonical wnt signaling. this is currently under investigation.

the intracellular domain of ror <dig> is composed of the tyrosine kinase domain and prd domain flanked by s/t domains. we have shown that neither the prd and s/t domains nor the tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for ror <dig> to mediate canonical wnt signaling. however, the intracellular domain of ror <dig> appears not to be entirely dispensable, suggesting that presence of the tyrosine kinase domain but not the tyrosine kinase activity is important.

different combinations of wnt ligands and mediators can affect different pathways  <cit> . whether ror <dig> is involved in non-canonical or canonical wnt signaling in a given cell may depend on the availability and abundance of its cofactors such as wnt5a, fzd <dig>  fzd <dig>  for example, in presence of fzd <dig> and lrp5/ <dig>  ror <dig> facilitates wnt3a to stimulate stf . however, in presence of high levels of wnt5a, ror <dig> facilitates the antagonistic effects of wnt5a on wnt3a  <cit> . the functional complexities of ror <dig> and other wnt related molecules determine the complex mechanism of wnt signaling and explain the multifaceted function of wnt signaling in various cellular functions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that ror <dig> modulates wnt3a-activation of canonical wnt signaling in h <dig> cells. in this role, ror <dig> cooperates with fzd <dig> but not fzd <dig> and its activity is dependent on lrp5/ <dig>  we have further shown that the crd and the tyrosine kinase domains, but not the prd domain and tyrosine kinase activity of ror <dig> are required for mediating the wnt3a-activation of canonical wnt signaling. these findings demonstrate the multifunctional properties of ror <dig> in canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling and support a functional scheme whereby regulation of wnt signaling is achieved by cooperative functions of multiple mediators.
