BACKGROUND
seasonal temperatures below 0°c are a major challenge to viability for terrestrial ectotherms around the world. in many cases, biochemical adaptations supplying cold tolerance are key to winter survival  <cit> . for many species, cold tolerance includes the ability to endure the freezing of body fluids and, among vertebrates, this capacity has been best-studied in a species that hibernates on the forest floor, the wood frog, rana sylvatica   <cit> . prominent adaptations that underlie wood frog freeze tolerance include the accumulation and distribution of huge amounts of glucose as a colligative cryoprotectant  <cit> , the synthesis of ice-nucleating proteins  <cit> , selective up-regulation of a variety of freeze-responsive genes  <cit> , and metabolic rate depression  <cit> .

the freezing of 65–70% of total body water in extracellular and extra-organ spaces halts heart beat and breathing and rapidly leads to conditions of anoxia and ischemia  <cit> . these conditions place energy stress on cells and over time the tissues of frozen frogs build up glycolytic end products  and deplete atp  <cit> . this reduces the adenylate energy charge : aec = /. however, viability is aided if aec can be maintained at a high value for as long as possible and so mechanisms are in place, particularly in skeletal muscle, to stabilize the aec. the action of adenylate kinase  allows some atp to be resynthesized from adp as it accumulates but this elevates . however, if amp is removed from the adenylate pool, the aec ratio can be kept at a high value at the expense of an overall reduction in adenylate pool size. this mechanism is commonly seen in working skeletal muscle and also under a variety of environmental stress conditions that compromise energy reserves such as hypoxia, ischemia  <cit> , freezing  <cit>  or during torpor in hibernating mammals  <cit> .

the removal of amp from the adenylate pool is primarily the function of 5'-adenosine monophosphate deaminase  which hydrolyzes amp to produce inosine monophosphate  and ammonium ion   <cit> . ampd action can lead to either a temporary drain of amp  or to a more permanent change if imp is channeled into catabolic pathways leading ultimately to uric acid excretion. in skeletal muscle, the enzyme is well-known to be key to stabilizing the aec during high-intensity muscle work in a range of vertebrate species  <cit> . the regulation of ampd is complex and includes activation or inhibition by ions and metabolite effectors  <cit> , reversible binding to myosin  <cit> , oligomerization  <cit> , and covalent modification  <cit> . moreover, regulation by one of these factors can influence subsequent control by others. for example, binding of ampd to myosin subunits alleviates allosteric inhibition of the enzyme from some sources, in addition to influencing substrate affinity and activity  <cit> . phosphorylation of ampd, in turn, may either influence or succeed binding, and has not yet been clearly elucidated  <cit> .

the present study examines the regulation of ampd in wood frog skeletal muscle. the enzyme from control  and frozen animals was compared to look for freeze-responsive changes in enzyme activity, kinetic parameters, phosphorylation state, temperature effects, and response to low molecular weight effectors.

RESULTS
activity and kinetic parameters of ampd in crude extracts of skeletal muscle
ampd is known to bind to myosin and a portion of total activity remains bound in the pellet after normal homogenization and centrifugation. the total activity of ampd in wood frog muscle was 22– <dig> u/gww and the majority of activity was in the soluble fraction . the percentage of ampd in the bound form was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % in control frogs and increased significantly to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % in muscle from frozen frogs. free ampd showed a sigmoidal relationship between velocity and  with values for the hill coefficient  that were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in muscle extracts from control frogs and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in frozen frogs . by contrast, bound ampd displayed velocity versus substrate concentration profiles that were essentially hyperbolic . affinity of free ampd for its substrate did not change between control and frozen states. however, s <dig>  amp of the bound enzyme was both significantly lower than the corresponding value for the free enzyme and changed between control and frozen states, s <dig>  amp of bound ampd from muscle of frozen frogs being 3-fold higher than the value for control frogs.

endogenous effectors of ampd
soluble fractions of crude muscle extracts were centrifuged through small columns of sephadex g- <dig> to remove ions and low molecular weight metabolites present in the crude extract. desalting reduced s <dig>  values for amp by 23–35%, but values for the enzyme from control and frozen frogs remained similar . the nh value for ampd from control frogs also increased significantly but was similar to the value for frozen frogs.

allosteric effectors of ampd
sephadex g- <dig> filtered ampd was assayed in the presence of potential effectors, to determine if these would affect activity. atp only activated the free  form of ampd, whereas adp activated both free and bound enzyme forms . the ka atp decreased significantly by 69% for ampd from muscle of frozen frogs, compared with the value for control frogs. atp activated ampd from control frogs by  <dig> -fold, whereas in frozen frogs, the fold activation was  <dig> . similarly, the ka adp for both free and bound forms of ampd was lower than the corresponding values for the enzyme from control frogs. the ka adp for bound ampd in control frogs was significantly higher than the corresponding free value for the enzyme from either control or frozen frogs. adp activated free ampd in control frogs by  <dig> -fold, whereas in frozen frogs, this increased to 5-fold. a similar increase was noted for the bound forms of ampd. adp activated bound ampd in control frogs by  <dig> -fold and this increased to  <dig> -fold in frozen frogs.

data are means ± sem, for determinations on sephadex g50-filtered muscle extracts from n =  <dig> individual frogs. significantly different from a the corresponding value in control frogs, b the corresponding value for bound ampd in control frogs, by the student's t-test, p <  <dig> . ne, no effect. ka is the activator concentration that produces half-maximal activation; values were determined at  <dig>  mm amp. ka and fold activation values were calculated using a nonlinear least-squares regression kinetics program  <cit> .

gtp was a very strong inhibitor with i <dig> values of just  <dig> – <dig>  mm . i <dig> gtp of free ampd was about 50% lower for the enzyme from frozen frogs but the value for bound ampd was unaffected by the transition to the frozen state. imp is the product of the ampd reaction. imp inhibited bound ampd from muscle of frozen frogs with an i <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm but interestingly, did not inhibit the enzyme in any other situation at the imp concentrations tested . salts also inhibited ampd; all three salts tested had cl- as the anion so differences in inhibitory effects are due to cation effects. na+ and k+ were very weak inhibitors of free ampd with i <dig> values in the range of 650– <dig> mm but both cations had much stronger effects on bound ampd with i <dig> values between 130– <dig> mm. nh <dig> +, another product of the ampd reaction, inhibited the free enzyme with i <dig> values in the 250– <dig> mm range. the effects of nh <dig> + on the bound enzyme could not be tested because nh <dig> + is the product being measured by the gdh-coupled assay used for the bound enzyme.

temperature and cryoprotectant effects
ampd activity was assayed in the presence versus absence of glucose, the cryoprotectant that is present in high concentrations in tissues of frozen frogs. activity was also assessed at high  and low  temperatures. addition of high glucose  significantly decreased the s <dig>  amp for the enzyme from both control and frozen frogs when assayed at high temperature, the effect being particularly strong  for the enzyme from frozen frogs . in contrast, s <dig>  amp increased significantly when the enzyme was assayed at a cold temperature , close to the freezing temperatures when frogs would naturally experience high glucose. the combined effects of cold temperature and high glucose together resulted in  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increases in s <dig>  amp for the enzyme from control and frozen frogs, respectively. the s <dig>  amp for ampd from frozen frogs under these conditions was still markedly higher  than the corresponding value for the enzyme from control frogs.

data are means ± sem, for determinations on sephadex g50-filtered muscle extracts from n =  <dig> individual frogs. a – significantly different from the corresponding value at 25°c without glucose as assessed by the student's t-test, p <  <dig> .

reversible phosphorylation
many enzymes are targets of covalent modification by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. to determine whether reversible phosphorylation affected bound ampd, incubations were set up in which enzyme phosphorylation or dephosphorylation was promoted by stimulating the activities of endogenous protein kinases and phosphatases. incubations that stimulated all protein kinases resulted in a significant 2-fold increase in s <dig>  amp of bound ampd from muscle of control frogs . similarly, s <dig>  amp of control ampd increased significantly when the activities of pka, pkc, camk, or ampk  were stimulated individually. however, stimulation of these protein kinases had no effect on the substrate affinity of ampd from muscle of frozen frogs.

when incubations stimulated protein phosphatase activities instead the opposite effect was seen. the s <dig>  amp of muscle ampd from frozen frogs decreased significantly by  <dig> % after stimulation of phosphatase activities. conversely, stimulation of protein phosphatases had no noticeable effect on s <dig>  amp of the enzyme from control frogs.

discussion
freezing imposes long term ischemia upon wood frog organs and while frozen, organ atp levels decline and so can the aec  <cit> . freeze-thaw cycles accelerate the decline in aec, and it can be expected that several freeze-thaw cycles must be endured over a typical winter  <cit> . studies of wood frog liver and leg muscle showed decreasing  in both organs during freezing but whereas a noticeable drop in aec occurred in liver, no appreciable change was noted in leg muscle over several freeze-thaw cycles. this implies that skeletal muscle has a metabolic strategy in place to support aec at high values for as long as possible  <cit> . this strategy appears to involve the action of ampd in draining amp from the muscle adenylate pool and hence, the present study addressed the regulation of skeletal muscle ampd, comparing enzyme properties from unfrozen versus frozen wood frogs.

an initial analysis of the maximum activity  and apparent substrate affinity  of wood frog ampd in soluble extracts of skeletal muscle found no change in these enzyme parameters between control and frozen states . removal of endogenous low molecular weight effectors using sephadex g <dig> spun columns reduced the s <dig>  for amp of the free enzyme from both control and frozen muscle by similar amounts and altered the nh value for control ampd . this indicates that one or more endogenous inhibitors  are present in crude extracts. further analysis of the responses by free ampd to activators and inhibitors showed differences between the enzyme from control and frozen states . the enzyme from muscle of frozen frogs had significantly lower ka values for atp and adp and the i <dig> gtp was also reduced by about 50%. overall, then free ampd in muscle of frozen frogs was more sensitive to high energy phosphates than in the control state. given that the levels of these high energy phosphates also fall in vivo in muscle during freezing, these changes in the properties of the enzyme could possibly maintain the relative sensitivity of the enzyme to regulatory control by high energy phosphates in the frozen state.

a comparison of bound ampd from muscle of control versus frozen frogs showed that control ampd had much higher affinity for amp than did the enzyme from frozen muscle . however, bound ampd from frozen frogs had a lower ka adp  which would increase bound ampd sensitivity to the product of atp hydrolysis in frozen muscle and potentially link it more closely to muscle energetics. interestingly, imp exclusively inhibited the bound form of ampd from frozen frogs, but did not inhibit free forms of the enzyme, or bound ampd in control frogs. the unique inhibitory effect of imp on bound ampd from frozen frogs suggests that this form of the enzyme exists in a distinct state, where it can be tightly controlled by key metabolites  that reflect the energy status of skeletal muscle while frozen.

binding to myosin is a major regulatory feature of ampd that has been extensively explored  <cit> . the amount of ampd that was bound in wood frog muscle increased from 20% in control frogs to 35% in frozen animals suggesting that a greater association of ampd with myofibrils benefited metabolism in frozen muscle. this response may be triggered by the anoxic/ischemic conditions that accrue as freezing progresses. low oxygen stress is known to enhance ampd binding in muscle from other species  <cit> . indeed, rundell et al.  <cit>  reported that muscle ampd remained bound as long as ischemic conditions persisted. bound ampd had a greater affinity for amp substrate than free ampd in both control and frozen frogs and bound ampd also showed hyperbolic amp kinetics compared with the sigmoidal relationship seen for free ampd. bound ampd was less sensitive to adp activation than was its comparable free form but was much more strongly inhibited by na+ and k+ ions in both control and frozen frogs.

not only is ampd distributed between free and bound states but myofibril-bound ampd is also subject to covalent modification by protein kinases and phosphatases  <cit> . indeed, cardiac ampd was phosphorylated by at least one major protein kinase, pkc  <cit> . protein kinases and phosphatases, although often soluble, can be compartmentally restricted through anchoring and scaffolding proteins, allowing them access to phosphorylate and dephosphorylate bound enzymes such as ampd  <cit> . to determine whether wood frog muscle ampd was subject to reversible phosphorylation, preparations of bound ampd from control frogs were incubated under conditions that stimulated the action of endogenous protein kinases . after protein kinase treatment, the enzyme consistently showed reduced affinity for amp  . conversely, conditions that promoted the dephosphorylation of bound ampd from frozen frogs caused an increase in amp affinity . this implies that wood frog muscle ampd is regulated by reversible phosphorylation when bound, and that in the transition from the control to frozen states, the phosphorylation state is modified. the data are consistent with a low phosphate form of bound ampd in control frogs and a high phosphate form in frozen frogs and with one of the actions of phosphorylation being to reduce the affinity of the bound enzyme for amp. enhanced phosphorylation of bound ampd may also be responsible for other changes in the kinetic properties of the bound enzyme from frozen muscle such as the change in sensitivity to adp activation, the unique inhibition by imp, and the response of the enzyme to high glucose.

freezing alters cytosolic conditions in frog cells, in particular by greatly elevating the concentrations of glucose which acts as a cryoprotectant. hence, effects of high glucose on enzymes need to be considered as well as potential interactions between cryoprotectants and temperature. high concentrations of glucose increased the substrate affinity for amp of bound ampd when the enzyme was assayed at 25°c but had relatively little effect on s <dig>  at low assay temperatures. by contrast, low temperature assay at 5°c decreased amp substrate affinity of the enzyme from both control and frozen frogs. overall, the additive effects of high glucose and low temperatures led to a substantial reduction in ampd affinity for its substrate compared with the situation at high temperature without glucose with increases in s <dig>  amp of 2-fold for the bound enzyme from control frogs and ~25% for ampd from frozen frogs. interestingly, both of these factors coupled together led to a combined decrease in substrate affinity of ampd. hence, both temperature change and high glucose could influence the function of ampd between unfrozen and frozen states.

many previous studies have focused on ampd in working skeletal muscle and found that the enzyme is more active and more bound under exercising conditions. by contrast, the present study suggests that in the frozen state, bound ampd is less active with reduced substrate affinity. this agrees with a study on ampd in muscle of hibernating mammals that found that substrate affinity was reduced at low temperatures in the torpid state  <cit> . ampd was also inhibited in rabbit heart experiencing hypoxia  <cit> . in that study, amp deamination was high early in the ischemic period, and this served to preserve the aec. after prolonged ischemia, however, ampd was stably inhibited and imp accumulation was implicated in ampd inhibition. hence, it can be recognized that ampd is involved in two forms of energy stress in muscles – that caused by burst muscle exercise  and that caused by ischemia/hypoxia due to oxygen limitation. in both cases, an initial decrease in atp and increase in adp and amp leads to an increase in the amount of bound ampd localized physically with the subcellular area where amp is accumulating. however, whereas energy stress due to exercise is typically short-lived until fatigue sets in and then quickly reversed, energy stress due to hypoxia/ischemia can be of indefinite term . therefore, it appears that species that are tolerant of freezing  allow their total adenylate pool to be partially depleted as an early response to stress  but then need to arrest the process and re-establish homeostasis in a hypometabolic state that can be sustained over the long term. phosphorylation of bound ampd may be the key in this phase. bound ampd in  <dig> h frozen frogs is a high phosphate form with relatively low affinity for amp and strongly inhibited by imp. hence, it is likely that enzyme activity in vivo is low over the long term in frozen muscle. effects of low temperature and high glucose  on s <dig>  amp support the same conclusion. numerous studies with multiple animal systems of diverse phylogenetic origins have shown that one of the key mechanisms that regulates animal transitions into hypometabolic states is protein phosphorylation  <cit> . the present data suggest that ampd activity is similarly integrated into the needs of the hypometabolic, frozen state by phosphorylation of the bound enzyme.

reversal of these processes during thawing, including enzyme dephosphorylation, temperature rise and glucose decrease, will all contribute to a return by ampd to normal function, as in control muscle. recovery of other enzymatic systems will also allow a recovery of muscle high energy reserves , the clearance of glucose and glycolytic end products, the re-establishment of aerobic metabolism, and the reactivation of a variety of energy-expensive cell functions that are typically strongly suppressed in hypometabolic states including the activities of ion motive atpases , transcription and translation  <cit> . given the variety of metabolic functions that must recover  after thawing, it is perhaps not surprising that hind leg reflex contractions took more than  <dig> hours to return in frogs thawed at 6–8°c  <cit>  and that isolated wood frog skeletal muscles still showed marked impairment of locomotor endurance up to  <dig> h post-freeze  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study shows that skeletal muscle ampd from control and frozen frogs has significantly different kinetic parameters that would alter enzyme function during freezing. binding, allosteric effectors, glucose, temperature and reversible phosphorylation all play roles in regulating wood frog ampd and adjusting enzyme function for optimal action in the regulation of cellular adenylate levels in ischemic frozen muscle. for example, phosphorylation of bound ampd may be responsible for some of the unique properties of the bound enzyme in frozen muscle such as the change in sensitivity to adp activation, inhibition by imp, and the response of the enzyme to high glucose. reversible phosphorylation control of ampd could also have a critical role in coordinating ampd function with respect to other enzymes of muscle energy metabolism to minimize overall energy use while frozen and achieve maximum extension of viability.
