BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum  plays a major role in the synthesis and folding of proteins. among them, there are proteins operating at the plasma membrane or in the intracellular compartments, such as the er, the endosomes, the lysosomes and the golgi apparatus  <cit> . acquisition of the protein’s native structure may fail or may progress unacceptably slowly, thus the er is equipped with a quality control mechanism that discriminates correctly folded proteins from misfolded polypeptides  <cit> . as nascent proteins emerge from the er translocation channel, the n-glycan glc3man9glcnac <dig> is attached to asn residues. following trimming by glucosidases i and ii, monoglucosylated n-glycans can associate with the lectin-chaperones calnexin and calreticulin which assist protein folding  <cit> . the entry of proteins into the monoglucose cycle is regulated by removal and readdition of the final glucose by glucosidase ii and udp-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyl transferase, respectively. properly folded proteins leave the er along the secretory pathway  <cit> . irreversibly misfolded proteins are sorted and degraded to neutralize their potential toxicity. this pathway is termed er-associated degradation  and is triggered by er stress  <cit> . it results in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins into the cytosol, followed by polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. three er degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase i-like proteins  have been implicated in disposal of misfolded glycoproteins from the er  <cit> . they belong to the glycoside hydrolase  <dig> family  comprising also the er α <dig>  mannosidase i and the golgi α <dig>  mannosidases. edems are thought to function as lectins. it has been demonstrated that overexpression of recombinant edem <dig>  <cit>  and edem <dig>  <cit>  accelerates release of terminally misfolded glycoproteins from the calnexin chaperone system thereby enhancing erad by terminating glycoprotein’s folding attempts. moreover, it is believed that in the mammalian er, removal of several mannose residues is necessary to elicit disposal from the er of misfolded glycoproteins. in this case man7-5glcnac <dig> glycan forms are generated  <cit> . there is an ongoing debate whether the edem proteins are active mannosidases. certainly, they possess the evolutionary conserved structure of the catalytic site as well as all the catalytic residues present in the other mannosidases of the gh <dig> family  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that edem <dig> can remove mannose residues from branch c  <cit>  and as suggested also from branch a of glycoproteins  <cit> . edem <dig> can also enhance de-mannosylation of erad substrates  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that edem <dig> initiates mammalian glycoprotein erad by catalyzing the first mannose trimming step and then mannose trimming from man8glcnac <dig> to man7glcnac <dig> is performed by edem <dig> and to a lesser extent also by edem <dig>  <cit> . except glycan recognition, it has been shown that edem <dig> and edem <dig> can recognize protein substrates also in a glycan-independent manner  <cit> . additionally, interactions of both lectins with proteins may depend on the structure of the substrate  <cit> . this was demonstrated during studies of the protein toxin ricin and the mechanisms of its retrotranslocation from the er to the cytosol  <cit> .

ricin is a natural, extremely potent protein toxin isolated from castor beans, the seeds of the castor plant, ricinus communis. ricin holotoxin is a heterodimeric protein that consists of two polypeptide chains  joined by a disulfide bond  <cit> . the a-chain  inhibits protein synthesis by irreversibly inactivating eukaryotic ribosomes . the b-chain  is a lectin, which binds to β- <dig> -linked galactose residues. after binding to the cell surface, ricin is endocytosed and then transported retrogradely through the golgi to the er . in the er, the disulfide bond connecting the ricin a-chain and the b-chain is reduced  <cit> , followed by a partial unfolding of rta, rendering it competent to cross the er membrane. ricin a-chain is transported to the cytosol presumably via the sec61p translocon in a similar manner as misfolded er proteins  <cit> . interaction between ricin and sec61α protein, the main component of the sec61p er translocation channel was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies  <cit>  and found in studies with isolated yeast er-derived microsomes  <cit> . it was reported that retrograde translocation of ricin a-chain was dependent on a functional sec61p complex  <cit> . despite the fact that ricin is not a typical erad substrate it can utilize specific components of er quality control to be translocated to the cytosol. in addition to interaction with edem <dig>  <cit>  and edem <dig>  <cit> , ricin a-chain requires sel1l, a component of the mammalian hrd <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex that takes part in the recognition of er degradation substrates  <cit> . interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that in contrast to shiga toxin, chaperone protein bip  negatively regulates ricin a-chain translocation from the er to the cytosol  <cit> . ricin a-chain contains a 12-amino-acid hydrophobic region , which is located close to its c-terminus. this region is hidden in the holotoxin but becomes exposed upon a and b chain dissociation in the er. it is possible that exposure of the rta hydrophobic region in the er triggers an interaction between ricin a-chain and membranes, er chaperones or even er translocons. it has been demonstrated that substitution of proline  <dig> into alanine  in this region results in a dramatic decrease in rtap250a cytotoxicity in vero and hek <dig>  cells  <cit> . decreased cytotoxicity of p250a ricin was explained by increased endosomal-lysosomal degradation of the toxin as well as reduced transport from the er to the cytosol  <cit> . moreover, transport of modified rta to the cytosol, in contrast to wild-type rta, appeared to be edem1- and edem2- independent  <cit> . the introduced p250a mutation alters the secondary structure of rta into a more helical structure suggesting that edems recognition might be determined by the structure of the erad substrate. recognition of protein substrates by er chaperones remains poorly defined. in the case of edem proteins it has been suggested that besides glycans, edem <dig> can recognize misfolded regions of aberrant proteins  <cit>  such as exposed hydrophobic domains  <cit> . in this study, we have verified that changed hydrophobicity of protein determinants may influence protein substrate interaction with edem <dig> and edem <dig>  we have demonstrated that ricin a-chain and a model misfolded protein, bace <dig> carrying mutations that significantly decreased their hydrophobicity, are poorly recognized by edem <dig> and edem <dig> in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. moreover, degradation of mutated bace <dig> with decreased hydrophobicity is significantly reduced. thus, we conclude that the chaperone proteins edem <dig> and edem <dig>  similarly to the so called ‘classical chaperones’, recognize hydrophobic regions of the protein substrates and interact with determinants that posses relatively high degree of hydrophobicity.

RESULTS
biophysical characteristics of rta mutants
to elucidate the significance of changed hydrophobicity of ricin a-chain on its intracellular transport and interaction with edem <dig> and edem <dig> proteins, we cloned appropriate genes with certain mutations and purified mutated forms of rta containing amino acid substitutions in the c-terminal hydrophobic region of the ricin a-chain. it has been demonstrated before that this region is important in ricin cytotoxicity  <cit> . the purpose of the mutagenesis was to change the hydrophobicity of the desired region but to retain the secondary structure and mostly unaltered tertiary structure of the ricin a-chain. detailed analysis based on the crystal structure of rta  <cit>  allowed us to select particular amino acids to be substituted . this analysis showed that in the highly hydrophobic c-terminal region of ricin a-chain four residues can be substituted into hydrophilic residues without affecting rta structure and its interaction with ricin b-chain . kyte-doolittle hydropathy analysis revealed significant decrease in the hydrophobicity of this region . on the other hand, two residues present in this region can be substituted into more hydrophobic residues increasing overall hydrophobicity of this region . based on this information, we produced ricin a-chain with decreased hydrophobicity in the c-terminal region   containing v245s, l248n, i252n, a253s substitutions. similarly, the two substitutions  were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to produce ricin a-chain with increased hydrophobicity in the c-terminal region  . secondary structures of rtadhf and rtaihf were examined by circular dichroism  and compared with the spectrum for unmodified rta. spectra for both rta mutants indicate no significant alternations in their secondary structure . the predicted models of rtadhf and rtaihf designed by geno3d server  <cit>  did not show any significant changes in their tertiary structure when compared to the model of wild-type ricin a-chain , what confirms our previous in silico analysis. additionally, there are no alternations in the localization of the mutated hydrophobic regions of ricin a-chain within the protein  and there are no significant changes in the surface charge distribution between wild-type rta and mutated forms, dhf and ihf .table  <dig>

to characterize the correct folding and overall stability of rtadhf and rtaihf, their sensitivity to trypsin  and pronase  was compared to that of wild-type rta. digestion patterns for the ricin a-chain mutants and wild-type counterpart were the same, confirming equal in vitro stability of mutant rtadhf, rtaihf and the wild-type protein . the digestion patterns significantly differ for denatured forms of ricin a-chain  what further confirms high stability of native forms of rta.figure  <dig>

the obtained modified ricin a-chain proteins were reassociated with ricin b-chain to form a holotoxin . to ensure that the introduced mutations were not affecting the reduction of the disulfide bond, either by increasing or decreasing the possibility of reductive cleavage, mutant rtadhf, rtaihf and wild-type holotoxin were incubated with increasing amounts of dithiothreitol . the results showed no significant difference in the rta mutants reducibility in comparison to wild-type holotoxin . the denatured forms of ricin were reduced by much lower concentrations of reducing agent , what also indicate that native forms of ricin holotoxin, wild-type and mutant forms dhf and ihf are properly folded.

the ricin a-chain mutants are not toxic to hek <dig> cells
to investigate whether mutations in the hydrophobic region of rta influence modified ricin a-chain cytotoxicity, hek <dig> cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutated forms  of ricin for 3 hours and the protein synthesis was then measured. data show that the introduced mutations that changed hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of rta, completely abolished the cytotoxicity of ricin . to further explain this observation, we compared the intracellular amount of ricin dhf, ricin ihf and wild-type ricin. cells were incubated with wild-type holotoxin or mutants with changed hydrophobicity for 3 hours. then intact toxin was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, separated under non-reducing conditions and analyzed with anti-rta antibodies. the results showed significant decrease in the amount of both ricin dhf and ricin ihf compared to the amount of wild-type toxin present in the cells .figure  <dig>

mutations that change hydrophobicity of rta influence the binding of modified proteins to the cell surface as well as affect their endosomal-lysosomal degradation
abolished cytotoxicity of ricin dhf and ricin ihf is at least partially connected with a decreased intracellular level of both proteins. to further investigate the reason for the reduced amounts of both mutated forms of ricin, measurement of binding of ricin holotoxin dhf and ihf to the cell surface was performed. cells were incubated with ricin at 0°c. this temperature stabilizes ricin bound the cell surface  <cit> . in this experiment western blot analysis with anti-rta antibodies was applied . in the case of both mutated forms of ricin , there was a significant decrease in the amount of cell surface-bound holotoxin proteins with changed hydrophobicity in comparison to the wild-type protein . observed differences were not due to the decreased stability of ricin dhf and ricin ihf after incubation on ice, as presented in figure 4c. these data suggest surprisingly that introduced mutations in the hydrophobic region of rta affect the binding of ricin ihf and ricin dhf to the cell surface. this may explain decreased intracellular levels of both forms of ricin . there are not any published results describing the importance of rta in the ricin holotoxin recognition and binding to the cell surface receptors. we can assume that interaction of modified ricin a-chains with the b-chain in the holotoxin is somehow altered, what might influence recognition of cell surface receptors by rtb .

to investigate whether decreased amounts of ihf ricin and dhf ricin might also result from the increased endosomal-lysosomal degradation of both mutated forms of ricin, the total amounts of wild-type, ihf ricin and dhf ricin were estimated by western blot analysis in cells cultured with and without bafilomycin a <dig>  bafilomycin a <dig> is an inhibitor of the vacuolar h+-atpase  <cit> . as shown in figure 4d, bafilomycin a <dig> only slightly increases the intracellular amount of wild-type ricin but significantly elevates the amounts of the mutated forms of ricin. importantly, the increase in the amounts of ihf ricin and dhf ricin in the presence of bafilomycin a <dig> is higher than for wild-type ricin when compared to their counterparts not treated with this inhibitor . therefore, both forms of ricin with increased and decreased hydrophobicity in the c-terminal region are more effectively degraded in low-ph compartments in comparison to the wild-type protein. interestingly, bafilomycin a <dig> increases also the amounts of partly degraded forms of ihf holotoxin and dhf holotoxin. all this may explain decreased intracellular amount of ricin mutants.

it has been demonstrated that ricin carrying a point mutation in the hydrophobic region of rta  is subjected to increased endosomal-lysosomal degradation and that mainly cathepsin b but also cathepsin d are responsible for the degradation of the ricin holotoxin p250a mutant in the cell  <cit> . in our next experiments we used pepstatin a, which is a potent inhibitor of aspartyl proteases, including cathepsin d, and ca <dig> methyl ester that blocks cysteine cathepsins, especially cathepsin b. we found that both cathepsins are also involved in the degradation of ricin ihf and ricin dhf .

rta mutants with changed hydrophobicity are transported to the golgi apparatus and to the er
to elucidate if ihf ricin and dhf ricin, similarly to the wild-type toxin, are transported to the golgi apparatus, the amounts of wild-type and mutated forms of ricin sulfated in the golgi complex were examined. for this purpose wild-type ricin sulf- <dig> as well as the mutants ihf ricin sulf- <dig> and dhf ricin sulf- <dig>  modified ricin molecules containing a sulfation site in the a-chain, were used. when cells are incubated with 35so42−, the a-chain becomes radioactively labeled due to the sulfotransferase in the trans-golgi cisternae  <cit> , and the fate of the 35so42−-labeled ricin molecule can be studied. as shown in figure 4e, sulfated ihf ricin holotoxin and dhf ricin holotoxin can be detected after 3 hours incubation with the toxin. thus, despite a dramatic reduction in the amount of both types of ricin in the cell, small fractions are transported to the golgi apparatus. this experiment also shows a detectable fraction of a sulfated rtadhf and rtaihf. since sds-page was performed under non-reducing conditions, it means that small amounts of mutated ihf holotoxin and dhf holotoxin reach the er where they become reduced.

recognition of rtadhf by chaperone proteins edem <dig> and edem <dig> is significantly decreased
it was shown previously that edem <dig> and edem <dig> proteins interact directly with the ricin a-chain  <cit> . the point mutation in the hydrophobic region of rta  impairs interactions between edem <dig> and rta  <cit>  and between edem <dig> and rta  <cit> . since p250a mutation changes the conformation of the ricin a-chain into a more helical structure, it was concluded that the precise structure of rta might determine its recognition by edem <dig> and edem <dig>  <cit> . to further investigate the mechanism of substrate recognition by edem <dig> and edem <dig>  interaction of edem proteins with rtaihf and rtadhf was examined. we cloned and purified the rta mutants with his-tag  that were next used in the pull-down assays. in these experiments equal amounts of mutated forms of rta and wild-type rta were used. figure  <dig> shows a significant decrease in rtadhf binding to edem <dig> and edem <dig> when compared to the wild-type rta. interactions between rtaihf and edem <dig> and between rtaihf and edem <dig> showed no statistically significant  differences in comparison to interactions with wild-type rta . these results indicate that for interactions between both edem <dig> and rta and edem <dig> and rta appropriate hydrophobicity of the substrate is important. in conclusion, reduced hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of rta results in impaired interactions with edems chaperone proteins.figure  <dig>

recognition of the c-terminal region of bace <dig> by edem <dig> and edem <dig> depends on the hydrophobicity of this region
to investigate whether the effect of the hydrophobicity is also important in interactions between edems and a typical erad substrate, we used the model misfolded protein, bace <dig>  this protein is a spice variant of human brain isoform bace <dig>  β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme, which is a type i transmembrane aspartyl protease. bace <dig> is expressed in human pancreas, its gene lacks  <dig> base pairs, what causes an in-frame deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the full-length bace <dig>  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that overexpression of edem <dig> accelerates degradation of bace <dig> but has no effect on properly folded bace <dig>  <cit> . both forms of bace have a hydrophobic region on their c-terminal end  that serves as a transmembrane domain. it remains unclear how misfolded membrane proteins are selected and destroyed during erad, however, except mannose trimming from n-linked oligosaccharides, recently published results presented a possible role for the transmembrane regions in this process  <cit>  . to elucidate whether changed hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of bace <dig> would affect its interactions with edem <dig> and edem <dig> proteins, we cloned a mutated form of bace <dig> , carrying three substitutions   that efficiently decrease hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of this protein . to minimalize the possibility of the disruption of the specific structure of this misfolded protein, we avoid any modifications of cysteine residues and did not modify any residues neighboring cysteines. in silico predictions revealed that these mutations did not change hydrophobicity to such an extent that it disturbs transmembrane location of this region  or that it changes misfolding status  of the luminal part of bace <dig> . otherwise, these changes might influence erad  <cit>  and affect interactions between bace <dig> and edem proteins beyond the studied decreased hydropobicity of the c-terminal region of bace <dig>  importantly, experimental data presented in figure  <dig> confirms transmembrane localisation of modified bace457dhf. cells were permeabilized with a various concentrations  of a nonionic detergent, digitonin to separate cytosolic fraction form the membranes. lower concentrations of digitonin, up to 5 μg/ml, selectively permeabilise plasma membrane, remaining er membrane intact  <cit> , higher concentrations of this detergent permeabilise also er membrane causing leakage of soluble er proteins to the cytosol, at a very high concentrations of digitonin the integrity of the er membrane may be disturbed. control experiments performed with a er membrane protein, calnexin and a luminal protein calreticulin revealed stable transmembrane location of calnexin . calreticulin was observed in the membrane fraction as long as the er membrane remained intact, at higher concentrations of digitonin, calreticulin was released to the cytosolic fraction . stable location of bace457dhf in the membrane fraction, similarly to bace <dig>  confirms er membrane localization of bace457dhf . in contrary to these observations, soluble form of bace <dig> – bace457Δ  <cit>  was released to the cytosolic fraction at relatively low concentrations of digitonin . to further confirm this observation, we investigated by confocal microscopy the localisation of bace <dig>  bace457dhf and bace457Δ together with calnexin. cells were permeabilised with 60 μg/ml of digitonin. due to the western blot analysis presented in figures 7a, b such concentration of detergent leaves the er membrane proteins in the membrane fraction and almost completely clears this fraction form the soluble er proteins. bace <dig> and bace457dhf were detected in the membrane fraction and both proteins were found to co-localise with calnexin . bace457Δ was not detected in this fraction what confirms our previous observations.figure  <dig>

to study interactions between bace457dhf and edem <dig> and between bace457dhf and edem <dig>  we coimmunoprecipitated bace457dhf and in control experiments bace <dig> with anti-ha antibodies from lysates of edem1-ha or edem2-ha-transfected cells . as shown in figure  <dig> bace <dig> interacts with both edem <dig> and edem <dig>  however, interactions of both chaperone proteins with bace457dhf are significantly reduced . it means that mutations responsible for decreased hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of bace <dig> influence its recognition by the chaperone proteins edem <dig> and edem <dig>  these data indicate that edem proteins alone or as a part of larger complexes are able to recognize hydrophobic transmembrane domains of misfolded erad substrates. additionally, it seems that sufficiently high hydrophobicity of protein substrate determinants is important for interactions with edem <dig> and edem <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
it is believed that mechanisms regulating recognition and degradation of folding-defective polypeptides expressed in the er is one of the central issues determining the proper functioning of human cells. how proteins are sorted for erad is still poorly understood. studies that have been performed during last decade show that edem family proteins are important regulators involved in disposal of misfolded glycoproteins from the er  <cit> .

in this study, we found that hydrophobic regions of the protein substrates seem to play a significant role in their recognition by the chaperone proteins edem <dig> and edem <dig>  recognition of erad substrates and protein toxins in the er seems to be a complex issue. n-linked oligosaccharides are undoubtedly used as specific signal tags for erad and specific signals generated and/or recognized by edem proteins. edem proteins conserve all catalytic residues required for glycolytic activity and for binding of the specific inhibitor of α <dig>  mannosidases, kifunensine  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that an increase of the intraluminal level of edem <dig>  <cit>  and edem <dig>  <cit>  substantially accelerates demannosylation of folding-defective polypeptides. interestingly, it has been shown that at low edem <dig> levels its association with the erad substrate is glycan dependent whereas, at high levels it is not  <cit> . glycan independent interactions of edem <dig> have been shown for: nhk, mutant variant of α1-antitrypsin   <cit> , mutant p23h rod opsin  <cit>  and the protein toxin ricin  <cit> . in the case of ricin, interactions with edem <dig> were also not dependent on carbohydrates  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been shown that edem <dig> can associate with a glycoprotein substrate in the absence of the mannose-trimming activity  <cit> . all these observations led to the suggestion that in addition to n-linked oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins, edem proteins can recognize misfolded regions of aberrant proteins.

ricin is not a typical erad substrate, however after holotoxin reduction in the er, ricin a-chain utilizes erad and its components in its retrotranslocation to the cytosol  <cit> . it has been demonstrated previously that a point mutation  in the hydrophobic region of rta alters the secondary structure of rta into a more helical structure without affecting the hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of rta  <cit> . the interactions between edem <dig> and rtap250a  <cit>  and edem <dig> and rtap250a  <cit>  were significantly reduced indicating that edem <dig> and edem <dig> protein recognition might be determined by the structure of the erad substrate.

in this study we have cloned genes coding for ricin a-chain mutants with decreased  and increased  hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of rta, to further characterize the molecular basis of substrate recognition by edem <dig> and edem <dig>  binding of both mutated forms of ricin to the cell surface receptors was significantly decreased. in ricin holotoxin, the b- chain is a lectin, which binds to β- <dig> -linked galactose residues widely present on mammalian cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. there is no direct contribution of ricin a-chain to the recognition and receptor binding of the ricin holotoxin. re-association of rtadhf or rtaihf with rtb produces a holotoxin with a reducible disulfide bond. however, due to the significant hydrophobic changes in the mutated rta , modified holotoxins can have altered conformation in comparison to the wild-type holotoxin e.g. changed localization of rtb in relation to rta. this might influence binding of mutated forms of ricin holotoxin to the cell surface receptors. decreased degradation of ricin dhf and ricin ihf in the presence of inhibitors of aspartyl and cysteine proteases represents the ricin transported to endosomes and lysosomes in an er-independent pathway. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the ricin mutated forms can also be affected by ups -mediated degradation. despite decreased intracellular levels of ricin dhf and ricin ihf, both forms reached the golgi complex and then the er. however, due to the small amounts of mutated ricin a-chains present in the er, it was impossible to study their retrotranslocation to the cytosol and examine their sensibility to proteasomal degradation, as was done for rtap250a  <cit> . importantly, pull-down experiments revealed that edem <dig> and edem <dig> recognize ricin a-chain with decreased hydrophobicity with significantly lower affinity. thus, both edem proteins bind exposed hydrophobic domains that possess appropriate high hydrophobicity. on the other hand, increased hydrophobicity of the c-terminal region of ricin a-chain does not result in elevated level of binding to edem <dig> and edem <dig>  we cannot however exclude the possibility that other chaperone protein present in the cell lysate bind the mutated highly hydrophobic region of rta so strongly that they inhibit to some extent rtaihf interactions with edem <dig> and edem <dig>  alternatively, we can speculate that in the case of rtaihf the increase in the hydrophobicity was not high enough to observe increased level of binding to edem <dig> and edem <dig> 

bace <dig> is relatively well characterized erad substrate. most of the proteins transiently expressed in human cells undergo inefficient folding in the er, leading to proteasomal degradation. detailed analysis revealed that bace <dig> is firstly directed to the er folding machinery, the calnexin cycle. after an insufficient folding process, extensively oxidized bace <dig> transiently enters in disulfide-bonded complexes associated with the luminal chaperone bip and protein disulfide isomerase   <cit> . edem <dig> overexpression resulted in faster release of bace <dig> from the calnexin cycle and earlier onset of its degradation, whereas edem <dig> downregulation prolonged its folding attempts and delayed erad  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated, that elevation of the intralumenal concentration of edem <dig> accelerated erad of bace <dig> by efficient de-mannosylation of n-linked oligosaccharides  <cit> . in this study, we show that edem <dig> and edem <dig> are able to recognize the hydrophobic region of bace <dig> which may significantly contribute to its degradation, since bace <dig> with a mutation that decreases hydrophobicity of this region is less effectively recognized by edem <dig> and edem <dig>  and degradation of bace457dhf is abolished. these results are in agreement with data for rtadhf, confirming that edem <dig> and edem <dig> recognize protein determinants possessing appropriately high hydrophobicity. this recognition might represent an important step in the differentiation between proteins undergoing a folding process and terminally misfolded proteins directed for degradation. the differentiation might be based on more extensive exposure of hydrophobic domains by terminally misfolded glycoproteins.

moreover, these data contribute to our overall understanding of erad of membrane proteins. integral membrane substrates expose one or more regions to the cytoplasm, which can be ubiquitinated. under debate is whether ubiquitinated membrane proteins are degraded by the proteasome in situ at the membrane or whether they are extracted prior to proteolysis. alternatively, degradation could start from an internal site on a cytoplasmically exposed loop after an endoproteolytic clip by the proteasome  <cit> . in these models, it is assumed that degradation and retrotranslocation are tightly coupled and occur at the er membrane. on the other hand, some integral membrane erad substrates, such as mhci  <cit>  and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator   <cit> , have been observed to reside in the cytoplasm when proteasome function is compromised. these data suggested that transmembrane hydrophobic segments might be solubilized from the lipid bilayer of the er prior to proteasome-mediated degradation. indeed, it has been demonstrated that the transmembrane domain of the erad substrate, ste6p, is released into the cytosol in a cdc48/p97- and atp-dependent manner  <cit> . candidates for factors that could maintain the solubility of transmembrane domains include cytoplasmic chaperones , proteasome associated factors such as rad23p/dsk2p  <cit> , and the 19s particle. interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that the proteasome 19s subunit can act as chaperone protein also for ricin a-chain, preventing aggregation of unfolded rta  <cit> . moreover, it was suggested that misfolding status of the cytoplasmatic domains of membrane erad substrates might influence the assembly of the intramembrane domain, which is recognized by hrd1p, an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex  <cit> . some reports suggest that an hsp <dig> family member-containing or putative lectin-containing complex in the er helps to recruit a misfolded substrate to the hrd1p complex  <cit> . the mannosidase-like domain of edem <dig> does not appear to be required for erad substrate binding, but this domain is involved in binding to sel1l-containing er membrane dislocation and ubiquitination complex  <cit> . it is possible that this domain also recognizes hydrophobic patches of aberrant proteins. we cannot exclude the possibility that recognition of hydrophobic transmembrane domains by edem <dig> and edem <dig> is necessary for solubilization from the lipid bilayer or that edems recognize already solubilized transmembrane domains. importantly, it has been demonstrated that several less-hydrophobic transmembrane sequences derived from multimeric transmembrane protein complexes can enter the er lumen completely, where they are recognized as substrates of the chaperone bip, which in turn initiate degradation of the unassembled subunit  <cit> . this new mechanism suggests a general link between proper integration of transmembrane segments and the er luminal chaperone machinery. interactions between hydrophobic transmembrane domain of bace <dig> and edems might explain differences between erad of membrane bace <dig> and its luminal form bace457∆. degradation of bace457∆ is faster than that of membrane bace457; half-life of bace457∆ is about 40 min, while that of bace <dig> is 4 h  <cit> . importantly, the lag phase for the soluble variant of bace <dig> is only 15 min, whereas for membrane bound bace <dig> it is 90 min  <cit> . these differences might be connected with necessity of extraction of transmembrane domain of bace <dig> out of the er membrane. hebert and colleagues suggested that edem <dig> serves as a quality control receptor that acts as a molecular link between misfolded proteins and sel1l  <cit> . recently published results show that degradation of bace <dig> did not require sel1l complex  <cit> . however, ricin a-chain transport to the cytosol depends on sel1l  <cit> . it is possible that the role of edem <dig> and edem <dig> in erad in some aspects is common for luminal and membrane substrates: extraction from the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and substrate de-mannosylation . however, after release from edem <dig> or/and edem <dig>  terminal acceptors of misfolded membrane proteins might be different from luminal aberrant glycoproteins.

about one-third of all mammalian genes encode secreted and membrane proteins, including numerous important molecules such as ion channels and cell surface receptors  <cit> . the high rate of protein synthesis and the large fraction of misfolded and unassembled proteins generated in the er, indicate that the erad plays a central role during active secretion, cell growth, and normal turnover in eukaryotic cells. understanding the mechanism of er protein quality control, specifically of how the cell recognizes and discriminates misfolded glycoproteins remains to be one of the central issues in cell biology.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that ricin a-chain and a model misfolded protein, bace <dig> carrying mutations that significantly decreased their hydrophobicity, are poorly recognized by edem <dig> and edem <dig> in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. moreover, degradation of mutated bace <dig> with decreased hydrophobicity is significantly reduced. the data presented in this paper contribute to the general understanding of the mechanism of recognition of misfolded proteins in the er and the role of edem <dig> and edem <dig> chaperone proteins in this process.
