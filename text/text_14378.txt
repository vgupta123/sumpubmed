BACKGROUND
adenosine receptors  are g protein-coupled receptors, consisting of a <dig>  a2a, a2b and a <dig> subtypes, activated by the endogenous agonist adenosine and blocked by natural antagonists, such as caffeine and theophylline. a <dig> and a <dig> subtypes are coupled to gi/o proteins, while a2a and a2b subtypes are gs protein-coupled. there is growing evidence that they could be promising therapeutic targets in a wide range of conditions  <cit> .

subtype-selective ar agonists have been developed, however, the selectivity for some organs or tissues is nearly unachievable using orthosteric agonists that act directly at the principal ligand binding site of the receptor. this is due to the wide distribution of ars and, indeed, a number of agonists were discontinued after the initial phases of clinical trials  <cit> . in contrast to directly-acting agonists, allosteric modulators act at a distinct site on the receptor protein to modulate the effect of a native agonist  <cit> . an advantage of an allosteric enhancer of a gpcr over its native, orthosteric activator is that greater selectivity can be achieved. this is due to allosteric sites being generally less conserved than the orthosteric site in a particular receptor family  <cit> . furthermore, the allosteric enhancer would enhance the action of the native agonist, but may have no effect of its own on the unoccupied receptor. thus, the effect of an endogenous agonist, which may be insufficient in a particular disease state, may be magnified in a temporally and spatially specific manner through allosteric modulation.

allosteric modulation of membrane receptors is best characterized in ligand-gated ion channels. the allosteric enhancer diazepam, which enhances the cns inhibitory function of the endogenous γ-aminobutyric acid, is a prototypic representative of the benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed sleep medications. in the gpcr field, cinacalcet, an allosteric enhancer of the calcium-sensing receptor , has recently been approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients suffering from chronic kidney disease  <cit> . in the case of ars, the a <dig> ar has been the most studied in this context, and one of its allosteric enhancers, t <dig> methanone), has been in clinical trials for the treatment of neuropathic pain. numerous allosteric enhancers and inhibitors for class b and class c gpcrs are also in various phases of clinical trials for treatment of a number of disorders  <cit> .

allosteric modulators for the a <dig> ar have been recently identified and characterized  <cit> . one class of these allosteric modulators, including the 1h-imidazo- quinolin-4-amine derivative du <dig>  was found to decrease agonist potency while enhancing its maximum effect   <cit> . recently, a new series of the imidazoquinoline derivatives has been synthesized  <cit> . several of those allosteric modulators, represented by luf <dig>  were found to also enhance emax but without affecting agonist potency. thus, the pharmacological profile as a positive allosteric modulator of the a <dig> ar was superior to that of du <dig>  in this study, we extended our previous observations by studying the nature of the potentially flexible modulation by luf <dig> of the agonists with a selection of a <dig> ar agonists having a distribution of emax values in a <dig> ar-expressing cho cells using a gtpγs binding assay  <cit> . we learned that the degree of allosteric enhancement is dependent on the orthosteric ligand examined, which was quantified using a mathematical model  <cit> , adding further subtlety to this new concept of gpcr regulation.

RESULTS
ar agonists and allosteric modulators used in the present study
a number of nucleoside agonists and one non-nucleoside agonist  used in the present study are shown in figure  <dig>  the 5' -substituted adenosine derivative neca is a high-efficacy ar agonist. medium or low efficacy agonists include: an n <dig> ,5' -trisubstituted derivative cl-ib-meca, a n6-monosubstituted adenosine derivative mrs <dig>  and a non-nucleoside agonist, luf <dig>  in addition to agonists, a nucleoside a <dig> ar antagonist , mrs <dig>   <cit>  and a non-nucleoside antagonist mrs <dig> were also included. the allosteric modulator  used in the present study is the imidazoquinoline derivative luf <dig>  which has been shown to retard agonist radioligand dissociation and to increase agonist emax, as demonstrated using a cyclic amp functional assay  <cit> . luf <dig> was relatively potent as an enhancer of a <dig> ar agonist activity in comparison to its a <dig> ar antagonistic properties. it did not bind appreciably at the other subtypes of ars.

effects of luf <dig> on the emax at the a <dig> ar of agonists with diverse structures studied with a gtpγs binding assay
the modulation by luf <dig> of the emax of diverse agonists at the a <dig> ar was studied using a gtpγs binding assay, which directly reflects activation of gi/o proteins. we first compared the emax-enhancing effects of luf <dig> under several experimental conditions:  addition of the enhancer luf <dig> and an agonist cl-ib-meca simultaneously ;  pre-incubation of the enhancer luf <dig> with membranes for  <dig> min before the addition of the agonist to be incubated for another  <dig> min ;  pre-incubation of membranes with both luf <dig> and an agonist for  <dig> min . it was found that luf <dig>  at the concentration of  <dig>  μm or higher, produced a similar enhancement of the emax of cl-ib-meca under all of these conditions. thus, the subsequent experiments were performed without the pre-incubation of luf <dig> and/or agonist with membranes. also, a longer incubation time  did not cause further stimulation, but increased the non-specific binding . the potency and emax of cl-ib-meca to stimulate gtpγs binding in the absence and presence of various concentrations of luf <dig> are summarized in table  <dig> 

the emax of neca in the absence of luf <dig> was expressed as 100%. results are expressed as mean ± s.e. luf, luf6000; na, not applicable.

luf <dig> had a less pronounced effect on the emax of neca , but showed a much larger effect on the low-efficacy agonist mrs <dig>  compared with its effect on cl-ib-meca. mrs <dig>  which has been shown to be an antagonist previously as demonstrated in a cyclic amp assay  <cit> , was also demonstrated to be an antagonist in the present gtpγs binding assay . however, interestingly, mrs <dig> was converted into an agonist by luf <dig> in a concentration-dependent manner . additionally, luf <dig> also enhanced the stimulation of gtpγs binding induced by the non-nucleoside agonist, luf <dig> , whereas it had no effect on the non-nucleoside antagonists mrs <dig>  and mrs <dig> . luf <dig>  at concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm, did not show any effect on the basal level of a <dig> ar activation in this gtpγs assay . the potency and emax of various ligands in the absence and presence of various concentrations of luf <dig> are summarized in table  <dig>  the dose-response curves of neca, cl-ib-meca, mrs <dig>  luf <dig> and mrs <dig> are shown in figure 3f. cl-ib-meca is only partially efficacious compared with neca in inducing gtpγs binding.

in order to confirm the effect of luf <dig> on the emax of the selective agonist cl-ib-meca at the a <dig> ar, we further tested its effect on two other a <dig> ar selective agonists, ib-meca and inosine. it was demonstrated that ib-meca was almost as efficacious as cl-ib-meca, and luf <dig> showed similar effect on these two a <dig> ar agonists. inosine only showed a low emax . however, in the presence of  <dig> μm luf <dig>  the emax of inosine was shown to be approximately 80% of the emax of neca.

unlike its effect on the a <dig> ar, luf <dig> did not affect the emax of two high-efficacy agonists cpa and ccpa or a low efficacy agonist mrs <dig> to activate the a <dig> ar .

mathematical modeling
the equations from hall  <cit>  were used to simulate various experimental curves and to derive conditions in which emax and ec <dig> vary. parameters in these equations are as follows. l is the receptor isomerization constant . k is the equilibrium association constant of ligand a. m is the equilibrium association constant of ligand b . α is the intrinsic efficacy of ligand a. β is the intrinsic efficacy of ligand b. γ is the binding cooperativity between a and b. δ is the activation cooperativity between a and b. l is only related to the receptor. the allosteric modulator brings three parameters, β, γ and δ, to the system. the proportion of receptors in the active state is:

 =++++++++++ 

this can be restated as:

 =l1+l+m 

since luf <dig> did not affect the function of the a <dig> ar when given alone, we concluded it has neutral intrinsic efficacy . next we derived the conditions under which the maximal effect  and observed potency of an agonist can change in the presence of an allosteric modulator. when there is a saturating concentration of agonist in the absence of allosteric modulator, the proportion of active receptor populations over all receptors is given by:

 active→∞,=0t=αl1+αl 

when there is also an excess amount of allosteric modulator, the proportion is given as:

 active→∞,→∞,β=1t=αlδ1+αlδ 

comparing these two equations, we learned that if

δ >  <dig>  the maximum response increases;

δ =  <dig>  the maximum response remains unchanged;

δ <  <dig>  the maximum response decreases;

based on hall's model of allosteric modulation, the agonist affinity ratio in the presence and absence of an allosteric modulator with neutral intrinsic efficacy is:

 active→∞,β=150=0=1+αlγ 

thus, if

 γ>1+αl1+αlδ, the potency increases ; 

 γ=1+αl1+αlδ, the potency remains unchanged; 

 γ<1+αl1+αlδ, the potency decreases ; 

we also analyzed the condition in which an allosteric modulator converts a neutral antagonist or even an inverse agonist into an agonist. in the presence of excess amount of an allosteric modulator, the window, i.e. difference in emax, observed in the absence and presence of a ligand in the orthosteric site is

 active=∞,→∞,β=1t−active= <dig> →∞,β=1t=lαδ1+lαδ−l1+l 

when αδ >  <dig>  agonism is observed. this implies that when δ, the parameter for activation cooperativity, is large enough, an allosteric modulator can convert a neutral antagonist and an inverse agonist into agonists.

we simulated a number of experimental concentration-effect curves as depicted in figure  <dig>  reflecting the use of different agonists . we only varied the intrinsic efficacy  of the orthosteric ligand a, i.e. for neca, cl-ib-meca, mrs <dig> and mrs <dig> α values were set to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectivly. the values of the other parameters were as follows: l =  <dig> ; k =  <dig> × 108; m =  <dig> × 106; β = 1; γ =  <dig> ; δ = 50; as is evident from figure  <dig>  these settings allow for a simulation of concentration-effect curves that closely resemble the ones obtained experimentally.

discussion
the result that luf <dig> alone did not show any agonist activity indicates that, under physiological conditions where the concentration of native adenosine is relatively low, luf <dig> should have no effect. the fact that luf <dig> showed significant enhancement of the emax of agonists, suggests that it could enhance agonist efficacy under some pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia and inflammation where concentrations of endogenous agonists are highly elevated.

it is interesting that luf <dig> was shown to enhance the emax of low-efficacy agonists to a larger extent than that of the high-efficacy agonists. furthermore, luf <dig> was demonstrated to be able to convert a nucleoside antagonist mrs <dig> into an agonist. the effect did not occur with the non-nucleoside antagonists mrs <dig> and mrs <dig>  this may suggest that the nucleoside antagonist may have a small residual activity that would normally be below the detection threshold but could be greatly magnified in the presence of luf <dig> 

the ability of gpcrs to adopt various conformational states, each with distinct pharmacological properties, and the phenomenon of stabilization of a specific conformation of a gpcr by an allosteric enhancer have been well documented  <cit> .

activation of a given gpcr could be accomplished with an allosteric agonist, in addition an orthosteric agonist  <cit> . conversion of antagonists into agonists has been demonstrated previously by site-directed mutagenesis of gpcrs  <cit>  or by chemical modification of the antagonists  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, there has not been a report regarding this type of conversion by an allosteric modulator, although an example of the conversion of an agonist into antagonist by an allosteric modulator has been reported previously  <cit> . thus, it is likely that our finding that an allosteric enhancer can convert an apparent antagonist into an agonist may be generalized to other gpcrs. a better understanding of the conformational states and the mechanisms of gpcr activation will facilitate the design of more effective and selective drugs.

a simple r⇔r* model representing the two conformational states  of the receptor has been previously used to rationalize the effect of the a <dig> ar enhancer pd <dig>   <cit> . pd <dig>  alone behaves as an allosteric agonist, promoting the a <dig> ar to its active conformation  and, thus, potentiates the a <dig> ar constitutive receptor activity. however, luf <dig> alone does not activate the a <dig> ar. thus, unlike pd <dig> , which shifts the receptor to the r* state directly, luf <dig> presumably does not cause such a shift.

an extension of the two-state model of receptor activation has been described by hall  <cit>  to account for the allosteric modulators affecting the agonist potency as well as the intrinsic efficacy of agonists. hall  <cit>  suggested that the most suitable assay system may be one with very low receptor expression in which even highly efficacious agonists are unable to fully activate the signal transduction cascade. we have previously described that our cyclic amp functional assay system is an ideal model for the characterization of the functional aspects of this class of allosteric modulators, especially the characterization of their effects on maximal agonist efficacy due to the less-than-complete inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by a <dig> ar agonists  <cit> . the present study extended the previous one by using the newly synthesized enhancer luf <dig> and structurally diverse agonists and by testing the stimulation of gtpγs binding. it was found that in the current gtpγs binding assay system, none of the agonists  were fully efficacious, as the allosteric enhancer luf <dig> was able to enhance the emax of all agonists used. thus, the current gtpγs binding assay may represent the most suitable assay system as hall suggested  <cit> , since even highly efficacious agonists are unable to fully activate the signal transduction cascade. the observations from the present study are consistent with that predicted by hall's model, and thus, the equations from hall  <cit>  were used to simulate various experimental curves from the present study and to derive conditions in which emax and potency vary.

for the mathematical modeling, two independent parameters are necessary to simulate various effects on efficacy and potency. the binding cooperativity shifts the potency of the agonist. the activation coöperativity changes the emax that the agonist can achieve, as well as the potency of the agonist. by contrast, the simple model of ehlert for allosteric modulation  <cit>  uses only one parameter to describe the property of allosteric modulation, so that it cannot simulate the current experimental results. the simple model of allosteric modulation can only generate curves with increased or decreased potency and efficacy at the same time.

as demonstrated in the present study, neca is more efficacious than cl-ib-meca in stimulating g proteins as measured in the gtpγs binding assay. an explanation for the observation that luf <dig> has a much stronger effect on cl-ib-meca than on neca derives from the mathematical modeling. neca has a relatively strong intrinsic efficacy, such that the response is already close to the maximum response. therefore, luf <dig> cannot enhance emax much further.

CONCLUSIONS
luf <dig> showed a flexible modulatory effect of efficacy depending on the emax of a given nucleoside derivative, being more effective for low-emax agonists than for high- emax agonists. the fact that luf <dig> did not show any effect on the basal receptor activity, yet showed an enhancement of agonist activity, suggests that such enhancers could be safer drugs than orthosteric agonists. the observations from the present study are consistent with the quantitative prediction using hall's model. a simple explanation for the observation that luf <dig> has a much stronger effect on cl-ib-meca than on neca derived from the mathematical modeling is that neca has relatively strong intrinsic efficacy, such that the response is already close to the maximum response. therefore, luf <dig> cannot enhance emax much further. the finding that an antagonist of the a <dig> ar can be converted into an agonist may represent a novel mechanism of gpcr activation and may be generalized to other gpcrs.
