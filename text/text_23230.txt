BACKGROUND
the genus helicoverpa  is a group of  <dig> species  <cit>  which includes some of the most devastating agricultural lepidopteran pest species, with h. armigera  and h. zea  being the dominant pest species in the old world and new world respectively. a few other species in the genus helicoverpa are pests of a range of crops but they are either limited in host plant range or are geographically restricted  <cit> . this includes h. assulta  which feeds only on solanaceae, and is endemic to asia, africa and australia  <cit> , and h. punctigera  which is polyphagous and endemic to australia  <cit> . the majority of helicoverpa species are oligophagous and are not considered as major agricultural pests.

until the work of hardwick  <cit> h. zea and h. armigera were considered conspecific  <cit>  within the genus heliothis oschenheimer  <cit>  as heliothis armigera. hardwick  <cit>  incorporated results from extensive morphological, rearing and hybridization studies, arranged these moths into a postulated evolutionary sequence of species groups, and at the same time resolved the taxonomic position of h. armigera and h. zea as separate species within the new helicoverpa genus, matthews  <cit>  confirmed the criteria used by hardwick  <cit>  for the helicoverpa genus, developing methods to inflate the helical bladder-like appendages in this genus. morphological characters and allozyme-based phylogeny suggested that h. punctigera is basal to h. assulta  <cit> . the evolutionary relationship between h. armigera and h. zea was uncertain and they were considered monophyletic, sharing a common ancestor with h. assulta  <cit> . allozyme studies revealed similarly large heterozygosities in h. armigera and h. punctigera but with h. zea displaying 61% less mean heterozygosity, and mallet et al.  <cit>  suggested that h. zea evolved from a small founding population of h. armigera . accurate demarcation of species boundaries and their distributions is essential for understanding pest demography. apart from the work of matthews  <cit>  which was confined to australia, there is a lack of firm systematic foundation in this genus and specifically that of important helicoverpa pest species such as h. armigera and h. zea. this represents a significant handicap for basic and applied research into these two important pest species.

larvae of h. armigera and h. zea are highly polyphagous. they possess the ability to enter diapause as pupae and are known to develop high levels of insecticide resistance  <cit> . adult moths also demonstrate high mobility  and fecundity   <cit> . population genetic studies of h. armigera have been conducted in different regions of the world using different genetic marker systems  <cit> . varying results from these studies reflect interactions between different agricultural practices and the life history of the pest species, and the nature of the different genetic marker systems applied. in australia, studies based on isozymes  <cit> , mitochondrial dna  control region  <cit>  and the sodium channel gene  <cit>  suggest large effective population size in h. armigera. however, microsatellite studies of australian h. armigera populations suggested monthly genetic shifts, highly variable gene flow between populations between years, and limited moth movements which varied between and within seasons  <cit> . results from these microsatellite dna studies contrast with studies carried out in eastern mediterranean populations using random amplified polymorphic dna  <cit> , and in african and european samples using isozymes  <cit> . these studies found little genetic variation between widely separated populations, supporting the idea that extensive long distance migration occurred in h. armigera. low genetic differentiation in the related long-range migratory pest heliothis virescens across the cotton belt within the united states of america has also been reported  <cit> .

despite intense agricultural interest in h. armigera as a polyphagous pest, very little systematic research has been conducted to resolve the question of the existence of sub-species at the local or global level. based on taxonomic data, paterson  <cit>  raised doubts as to whether h. armigera constituted a single genetic species or formed a complex of cryptic species over its geographic range. although the existence of cryptic h. armigera species has not been disproved, mating experiments that involved h. armigera from different regions of the old world strongly supported its single species status  <cit> . in india, various reports suggested that h. armigera could be categorized into races, based on their host-feeding preferences, and that these races do not interbreed freely  <cit> . kranthi et al.  <cit>  reported variable metabolic mechanisms mediating pyrethroid resistance, with the shift from mfo-mediated pyrethroid resistance to an esterase-mediated mechanism during mid october in central india, which might have been related to different h. armigera populations being sampled at these times from different crops. differential responses of h. armigera populations to pheromone  <cit>  and parasitoids  <cit>  were also reported in india. it has been suggested that independent evolution of lineages may be demarcated by food plant differentiation, facilitating the development of host races or host differentiated species  <cit> . "cotton" and "non cotton" field races of h. armigera have also been generated through laboratory selection of field-collected insects on cotton fruit buds . these races were characterized by differing  cornutal spine number on the male aedeagus  <cit> .

to date, no molecular studies have assessed phylogeographic patterns among worldwide populations of h. armigera. analysis of mtdna has provided valuable insights into understanding natural genetic diversity and population structures in other organisms  <cit> . it is clear that both demographic and bio-geographic forces shape the depth and distribution of lineages in a phylogenetic tree, while selecting the correct loci in constructing a phylogeny is of equal importance due to differing evolutionary rates among different dna regions, and within and between different loci . for example, interpreting mtdna phylogeny should proceed with caution because this locus is highly prone to selective sweeps due to its single locus nature and the general lack of recombination. furthermore, inherited symbionts such as wolbachia and other bacteria may also cause maternal cytotype sweeps  <cit> . nevertheless, the mtdna genes, especially that of the cytochrome oxidase sub-unit i  gene have been used extensively in phylogenetic studies due to the ease of primer design and its range of phylogenetic signal. the rate of evolution in this gene is also sufficiently rapid to allow the discrimination at the species level and the identification of cryptic species  <cit> , and has been used in establishing host plant associated genetic differentiation  <cit> . this study therefore aims to provide the first broad scale screening of mtdna variation in h. armigera globally. the genetic information collected is used to address the questions of single species status and of host races, and to infer phylogenetic relationships amongst the four pest helicoverpa species.

RESULTS
pcr amplification and sequence analysis
preliminary population sequence survey of  <dig> bp mtdna region  indicated the partial coi gene at nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig> as being the most informative region for our h. armigera and h. zea population study. the  <dig> randomly sampled h. armigera and  <dig> h. zea haplotype representative samples all possessed identical trna-leu gene sequence to the deposited h. armigera trna-leu sequence . in the  <dig> h. armigera samples, two transitional mutations  were detected. the g/a mutation involved one individual each from burkina faso and pakistan that belonged to the same mtdna haplotype . the c/t base change involved an australian  and a pakistan  sample. there were four c/t transitional mutations from nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig> between the  <dig> h. zea and the  <dig> h. armigera samples. these four mutations increased the number of steps by one between haplotype hzea- <dig> and hzea- <dig>  and the number of steps by three in the haplotype network between h. armigera and h. zea . all transitional mutations between nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> were parsimoniously uninformative at the intra- and inter-species levels in h. armigera and h. zea. the mtdna region from nucleotide position  <dig> to  <dig> was therefore excluded in analyses of all remaining samples.

pcr amplification of the informative partial mtdna coi fragments for all individuals of h. armigera, h. zea, h. punctigera, h. assulta and heliothis virescens gave pcr products of the expected size. a final  <dig> base pair  sequence  was analysed, following trimming of invalid end sequences and sequence alignment. the coi sequences showed no ambiguity and no premature stop codons. a total of  <dig> snps were identified from the  <dig> bp partial coi region in  <dig> h. armigera samples resulting in  <dig> mtdna haplotypes. a total of  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions were detected in these partial coi sequences. multiple amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the three non-synonymous changes are in haplotype harm- <dig> ; harm- <dig>  and harm- <dig> . amino acid substitutions in harm- <dig> and harm- <dig> resulted in the replacement of one hydrophobic amino acid with another, while in harm- <dig> the amino acid substitution occurred between hydrophobic and polar groups. of the  <dig> variable sites identified,  <dig> sites were parsimony informative and  <dig> were non-informative.

haplotypes
the most prevalent haplotype found in all countries was designated harm- <dig>  harm- <dig>  found in uganda and australia, was the most diverged haplotype with seven mutation steps from the major haplotype harm- <dig> . haplotypes harm- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed the major haplotypes commonly found in all countries except uganda  and pakistan  . the frequencies of unique haplotypes were comparatively low within individual countries . the haplotype network revealed no major groupings of h. armigera haplotypes according to either host plants or geographical clade . a total of  <dig> haplotypes were identified from  <dig> h. zea individuals sampled from northern  and south america . haplotypes hzea- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found in both north and south american continents, while the remaining haplotypes were unique to either the north or south american populations. the h. zea haplotype network is most parsimoniously linked to the h. armigera clade through harm- <dig> found in burkina faso . all mtdna coi haplotypes identified in this study have been deposited in genbank .

f-statistics  and analysis of molecular variance 
because of the generally small sample sizes in the individual collections from the indian sub-continent, populations were grouped as central , north  and south  in f-statistics analysis which showed significant gene flow between these three regions . analysis of molecular variance detected no genetic structure at various hierarchical levels , with  <dig> % of variation accounted for at the within population  level, with only  <dig> % variation observed among groups . pairwise fst values  were low in the study samples, and ranged from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> . the observed nucleotide diversity between countries was also very low and ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  .

phylogenetic inference and genetic distance
the hky + g  <cit>  model was selected by modeltest version  <dig> . model parameters estimated were based on empirical base frequencies  with no proportion of invariable sites, and a  <dig>  gamma distribution shape. the maximum likelihood  tree from partial coi sequence was sufficiently resolved between species based on the criteria of huelsenbeck and hillis  <cit> , with all nodes being supported by bootstrap values of greater than 70% . the range of genetic distances of h. armigera within africa  was  <dig>  –  <dig> , within australia  <dig>  –  <dig> , and within asia  was  <dig> –  <dig> . genetic distances between the three continents ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig> . genetic distances between all four species of the genus helicoverpa and heliothis virescens were also estimated . the pairwise genetic distance between h. armigera and h. zea ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and was intermediate between the intra- and inter-specific genetic distances in these heliothine moth species.

discussion
this study presents results from the informative region of the coi partial gene in h. armigera and h. zea sampled from five different continents. preliminary study involving a total of  <dig> h. armigera and h. zea found no length polymorphisms or snps in the trna-leu gene. furthermore, h. assulta and h. punctigera also possessed identical trna-leu length as that of h. armigera and h. zea. various studies have reported the presence of indels at this region from insect groups such as in the honeybees apis mellifera  <cit>  and between closely related butterfly species of heliconius genus  <cit>  and papilio genus  <cit> .

the mtdna coi haplotype network and estimates of f-statistics based on the  <dig> bp informative region strongly suggest that the h. armigera mtdna from  <dig> samples forms a homogeneous group of haplotypes, as expected if they consist of a single species across the portion of the geographical range sampled here. our mtdna coi phylogeny also revealed that all h. armigera haplotypes were grouped as one clade and that the long branch length of h. zea nested within the h. armigera clade  possibly suggests a historical founder event from h. armigera. the relatively low haplotype diversity identified in h. zea directly reflected the limited number of specimens and populations available for this species in this study. low genetic variation in the partial coi sequences was detected in h. armigera, with haplotypes harm- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> making up  <dig> percent of genetic variation observed.

generally, the pattern of genetic variation seen at the partial coi region of h. armigera is continuous and consistent between regions; that is, each haplotype, when present in two or more individuals, has a wide geographic distribution. such a pattern is common in organisms capable of long-range movement  <cit> . our mtdna coi partial sequence data therefore supports the occurrence of long distance gene flow in this pest species, which is further supported by the low fst values and low among-group haplotype variance across all three continents. migration in h. armigera may not necessarily occur only as single or multiple long-distant flights, but may also involve human-aided movements of agriculture commodities between continents. the maximum genetic distance within asian countries  is  <dig>  as compared to within both the african  and australia  continents. the isozyme study of australian h. armigera populations sampled across a  <dig>  km study area by daly and gregg  <cit>  also reported very little genetic variation . non-significant isozyme allele frequency differences were also found between populations of h. armigera located on either side of the sahara desert, thereby suggesting that geographical barriers such as the sahara desert have not prevented long distant migration in h. armigera  <cit> . long distant migration in h. armigera has been further suggested by the trapping of adult moths on ascension island,  <dig>  km from the african coast  <cit>  and willis island in the coral sea,  <dig> km off the coast of queensland, australia  <cit> . that h. armigera constitutes a single species across its distribution range with demonstrated long distance migration ability is further supported by the intercontinental crossing experiments of colvin et al.  <cit> , whereby mating between h. armigera from the african, asian and australian continents did not lead to a reduction in fecundity or offspring viability.

the mtdna coi haplotype network  and phylogenetic analysis failed to revealed specific host affiliations, both within indian populations of h. armigera and across the old world. genetic studies of generalist phytophagous insects often reveal complexes of genetically differentiated host races or cryptic species, but the extent of genetic difference correlated with host plant association in the h. armigera samples available in our study is inconclusive both at the global level and more specifically within the indian populations due to small sample sizes. bhattacherjee  <cit>  reported that indian h. armigera showed variability in host preferences, responded differentially to parasitoid attacks  <cit>  and when exposed to pheromone blends  <cit> , suggesting the presence of sub-species or races. however, jadhav et al.  <cit>  failed to confirm the presence of sub-species in h. armigera based on a survey of male internal morphological characters and their association with hosts. laboratory experiments of kranthi et al.  <cit>  showed that laboratory cotton and non-cotton races of h. armigera possessed distinct internal morphological features . as an example of a study in which mtdna coi sequence comparisons did reveal cryptic species, crespi et al.  <cit>  found that the australian gall forming thrips represented a pair of sibling species, previously indistinguishable. our study failed to find such differentiation based on  <dig> bp of the mtdna coi gene. currently, there is no compelling molecular evidence for the existence of h. armigera sub-species or races in the old world. further work using nuclear dna makers or genes associated with the detoxification of secondary plant compounds may yet reveal differentiation. for example, strong genetic differentiation in maize and mugwort races of the european corn borer  was reported by thomas et al.  <cit>  based on allozyme markers, while only low genetic differentiation of races was detected by mitochondrial dna analysis  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the four important pest helicoverpa species indicated that all h. armigera haplotypes formed a monophyletic clade which included the new world species h. zea. this phylogeny also revealed that h. punctigera is basal to h. assulta, which is in turn basal to h. armigera and h. zea . the current mtdna coi phylogeny is congruent with the phylogeny of mitter et al.  <cit>  as inferred from morphological characters and allozyme data, although their work did not provide a well resolved phylogenetic relationship between h. armigera, h. zea and h. punctigera. in this investigation the phylogenetic relationships of all four helicoverpa pest species based on mtdna coi region were sufficiently resolved and supported by bootstrap values of greater than 70%. this study demonstrated that the mtdna coi gene is suitable for resolving helicoverpa phylogeny. the inclusion of other helicoverpa species and combining evidences from mtdna coi and rapidly evolving nuclear non-coding sequences  will be necessary for constructing a robust helicoverpa phylogeny, especially that between the two closely related h. armigera and h. zea species. a monophyletic relationship between h. armigera and h. zea  was inferred based on the nuclear elongation factor 1-alpha  gene  <cit>  and the dopa decarboxylase  gene  <cit> , while a ddc and ef-1α multi-gene phylogeny also supported monophyly between h. zea and h. armigera with a higher bootstrap value  <cit> .

pairwise genetic distances between h. armigera and h. zea  were intermediate between that expected for intra- and interspecific comparisons, thereby indicating high levels of genetic similarity between h. zea and h. armigera. hebert et al.  <cit>  proposed the 3% nucleotide divergence level at the mtdna coi gene for differentiating between different lepidoptera species, although whinnett et al.  <cit>  cautioned against this and advised the inclusion of additional data types prior to drawing such conclusion. in the noctuid moth busseola fusca, sezonlin et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> % nucleotide divergence  in mtdna cytochrome b gene between different clades of the same species. the similar genetic distance reported in this study suggests that h. armigera and h. zea are more closely related to each other than the case with the busseola fusca species, possibly due to a more rapid divergence rate.

the estimates of divergence time between h. armigera and h. zea, by applying a linear rate of substitution in short term evolution  <cit>  of 2% per million years  <cit> , suggest that the north and south american continents h. zea populations were established via a founder event from h. armigera no more than  <dig>  million years ago. this is further supported by highly similar morphology  <cit>  and the mating compatibility between these two species  <cit> , although the possibility of mating incompatibility via mechanical isolation  between these two species was also reported  <cit> . based on high sequence homologies in the transposable element piggybac, zimowska and handler  <cit>  proposed h. zea and h. armigera inter-mating as a possible explanation for the propagation of these mobile elements, while arguing for conspecific status in h. zea and h. armigera should these elements share the same genomic insertion sites in these two species. the founder event hypothesis should be further tested through a better h. zea sampling regime across the northern and southern american continents, as strong geographic components to intraspecific polymorphisms and inadequate sampling can lead to inaccurate phylogenies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that for pest management purposes, there is currently no molecular basis for treating geographic or host specific populations of h. armigera differently. the current study does not suggest that h. armigera and h. zea are a single species but does show their close relationship and indicates a fairly recent  divergence of h. zea from a parental h. armigera stock. we should utilise their genetic similarity as the basis of formulating strategies for concerted future research efforts into areas such as complete genome sequencing, and the mapping and identification of economically important genes  through crossing experiments. the scientific community is now presented with a valuable opportunity, whereby the complete genome sequencing of either one of these species will significantly advance our understanding of genome organisation of both, and thus our efforts in fighting against two of the most destructive lepidopteran pests of the old and new worlds.
