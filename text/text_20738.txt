BACKGROUND
the extent of non-random association of gametes at different loci, or linkage disequilibrium , has become the focus of many recent studies in both humans and animals  <cit> . gaining knowledge of the distribution of ld in livestock populations is important for genetic mapping of economically important traits such as disease resistance  <cit> , and it can reveal population history and breed development  <cit> . moreover, genome wide association  studies as well as genomic selection in livestock rely on the existence of ld between causative variants and genetic markers  <cit> . recent advances in genotyping technology allow high density genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for several livestock species such as cattle  <cit> , chickens  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . obtaining high density genotypes from a sample of individuals allows for the estimation of genome-wide ld and persistence of phase among breeds  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that the extent and persistence of ld in livestock  <cit>  is much larger than that found in human populations  <cit> , due to selection and smaller effective population size in livestock species  <cit> . using dense markers to cover the genome increases the likelihood of snp markers to be in high ld with causative genes altering important production phenotypes  <cit> . meuwissen et al.  <cit>  proposed that the merit of these markers in livestock would be in the parallel use of all markers to derive genomic breeding values  as a composite score of all individual snp effects rather than improving mapping of quantitative trait loci .

the implementation of genomic selection using gebv has been successful in dairy cattle  <cit> , and is currently being tested in laying chickens  <cit> , and pigs  <cit> . the reliability of gebv prediction relies on the level of ld between markers and qtl, the origin of such ld , the number of animals used in the training population as well as heritability of the trait  <cit> . in this study it is our objective to estimate and describe genome wide levels of ld in four pig breeds using high density genotypes. we also estimate population-wise ld for a variety of panels with lower marker density in order to estimate the number of markers needed to reach a given level of ld. we estimate persistence of phase between the four breeds in this study as a measure of relationship between these populations.

RESULTS
estimation of linkage disequilibrium
to estimate ld, we genotyped  <dig> animals in  <dig> sire/dam/offspring trios across four breeds of pigs  using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . we used beagle  <cit>  to build haplotypes and estimated pairwise r <dig> for all snp on the same chromosome using equation . average r <dig> between adjacent markers within breed was estimated using equation . average r <dig> at various distances was computed by grouping all snp combinations by their pairwise distance in classes of  <dig> kb of length starting at  <dig> to  <dig> mb. figure  <dig> displays an overview of the decline of r <dig> over distance in each breed. in addition, table  <dig> displays average r <dig> for adjacent markers and at  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> mb. the average r <dig> between adjacent snp was largest in the duroc animals , followed by hampshire , whereas yorkshire and landrace exhibited the smallest average r <dig> . marker pairs with an average distance of  <dig> mb had an average r <dig> of  <dig>  for hampshire,  <dig>  for duroc,  <dig>  for yorkshire and  <dig>  for landrace. for all breeds, at least 54% of the adjacent snp had r <dig> ≥  <dig>  and 44% had r <dig> ≥  <dig> . for most chromosomes, average r <dig> between adjacent snp in duroc and hampshire was larger than average r <dig> in landrace or yorkshire. in addition to estimating average r <dig> within distance classes, we also computed average r <dig> between adjacent markers for different marker densities. to obtain marker sets with various snp densities we sequentially removed markers from the current map using every second, fourth, 10th, 50th, 100th and 200th marker . average r <dig> decreased between 6% for yorkshire to 15% for hampshire when only 50% of the markers were used, with highest average r <dig> for duroc  followed by hampshire , yorkshire  and the lowest for landrace . using only every 10th marker, average r <dig> decreased to around 50% of the original r <dig> , and using every 100th marker average r <dig> ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  at an average marker distance of  <dig>  mb, which was comparable to the results found for average r <dig> at  <dig> mb.

persistence of phase
persistence of phase is a measure of the degree of agreement of ld phase for pairs of snp between two populations. to estimate persistence of phase, we calculated rij as the square root of rij <dig> in equation  between all possible combinations of snp i and j respectively, using the sign of the non-squared numerator. if r <dig> between two markers is equal in two populations, but their corresponding r has opposite sign, the gametic phase is reversed  <cit> . persistence of phase over a certain genomic distance interval can be estimated as the pairwise pearson correlation coefficient  of inter-marker rij between two populations k and k' . for all pairwise comparisons of breeds we estimated rk, k' and the percentage of snp with reversed sign of r. similar to our computation of average r <dig>  we grouped snp pairs in classes of inter-marker distances  <dig> kb long and computed persistence of phase within each class starting at  <dig> up to  <dig> mb . in theory, the pearson correlation coefficient ranges between - <dig> and  <dig>  large negative values are a result of high ld  in both breeds but phase is reversed between them. high positive values are a result of high r <dig> and equal phase in both breeds  <cit> . correlation of phase between snp less than  <dig> kb apart ranged from  <dig>  for duroc with hampshire and yorkshire to  <dig>  for landrace with yorkshire. considering snp pairs with an average distance of  <dig>  to  <dig> mb, correlation of phase decreased to  <dig>  for duroc with hampshire and to  <dig>  for yorkshire with landrace . persistence of phase decreased with increasing marker distance at a rate comparable to that observed for the decrease in average r <dig> with increasing marker spacing. the slope of the decline was lower for the correlation between landrace and yorkshire when compared to other breed comparisons. applying a z-test with fishers' transformation  <cit>  to the correlation of phase at <  <dig> kb, the correlation of phase between landrace and yorkshire was significantly larger  than all other breed combinations. results for the correlation of phase were not significantly different  in the duroc-hampshire, duroc-landrace, duroc-yorkshire, hampshire-yorkshire, and hampshire-landrace pairings . for these five population comparisons, the average proportion of snp with r having opposite sign ranged between 9-11% for snp spaced within  <dig> kb and up to 45-49% for snp spaced between  <dig>  and  <dig> mb . in general, the estimates of r with reversed sign for landrace-yorkshire were lower ranging from 9% to 45%. these results suggested a closer population relationship between the landrace and yorkshire populations than among all other populations.

discussion
extent of linkage disequilibrium
current effective population size of the breeds used in this study was previously estimated, using pedigree information, to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . consistent with having the largest current effective population size, we find that long range r <dig>  estimated from our data was smallest for duroc and yorkshire . in hampshire, a smaller effective population of  <dig> corresponded to higher r <dig> at  <dig> mb . due to the similar long range r <dig>  at  <dig> mb we would have expected the landrace population to have an effective population size comparable to that of duroc and yorkshire. however, using pedigree data welsh et al.  <cit>  estimated the current effective population size of landrace to be  <dig>  the reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. several previous studies investigated ld in pigs using reduced numbers of microsatellite markers and fewer animals from commercial populations  <cit> . nsengimana et al.  <cit>  found relatively large estimates of ld  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  using  <dig> microsatellite markers. in contrast, using r <dig> instead of d' and thereby correcting for minor allele frequency, harmegnies et al.  <cit>  found r <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for marker distance <  <dig> cm and  <dig> - <dig>  for markers spaced between  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm, using  <dig> microsatellite markers on ssc <dig>  comparable to our results of r <dig> between  <dig> - <dig>  for markers spaced between  <dig> and  <dig> mb. du et al.  <cit>  estimated r <dig> from  <dig>  snp markers in six commercial lines of pigs and found estimates of average r <dig> =  <dig>  for markers less than  <dig>  cm apart, and estimates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  at marker distances of  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm respectively. similarly, our populations had average r <dig> of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  at marker distances of  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb, respectively. a recent study conducted by uimari & tapio  <cit>  used the same genotyping platform as our study to estimate r <dig> and effective population size in finnish landrace and yorkshire populations. uimari & tapio  <cit>  found average r <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for adjacent markers in the finnish landrace and yorkshire populations, respectively, which was higher than our results of  <dig>  for landrace and  <dig>  for yorkshire. in addition, uimari & tapio reported that the r <dig> for markers spaced at  <dig> mb decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the finnish landrace and yorkshire breeds, respectively. in the present study, r <dig> declined further to  <dig> - <dig>  at  <dig> mb marker spacing for landrace and yorkshire . the higher average r <dig> for distant  markers in the finnish populations could be explained by smaller effective population size of the finnish populations, causing higher r <dig> on average. this is partially confirmed by comparing the estimated effective size of the finnish populations   <cit> , to estimated effective population sizes of the populations used in the current study reported by welsh et al.  <cit>  , where the current effective population size for finnish yorkshire is approximately half that of our yorkshire population. compared to recent estimates from canadian populations we found estimates of average r <dig> for markers with pairwise distance below  <dig> kb to be consistent in landrace  and yorkshire   <cit> . however, in duroc estimates of average r <dig> for markers with pairwise distance below  <dig> kb were considerably higher in the us population  compared to the canadian population   <cit> .

persistence of phase
persistence of phase can be used to infer upon the history of a species and relatedness of breeds within that species as well as on reliability of across population gwa and gevb prediction  <cit> . persistence of phase was previously reported for three canadian swine breeds   <cit> . for snp with pairwise distance below  <dig> kb we estimated persistence of phase to be  <dig>  between landrace and yorkshire and  <dig>  for both landrace and yorkshire with duroc. in the canadian breeds persistence of phase also indicates a closer relationship between landrace and yorkshire  and a more distant relationship between landrace/yorkshire and duroc  <cit> . we found correlation of phase of  <dig>  for landrace/yorkshire with duroc, while the canadian breeds had  <dig> / <dig> , indicating less agreement of phase even at short pairwise distance  <cit> . our results showed that correlation of phase for the pig breeds in this study ranged between  <dig>  for duroc-yorkshire and  <dig>  for landrace-yorkshire for markers with pairwise distance <  <dig> kb. previous research in australian cattle breeds  <cit>  showed correlation of phase between  <dig>  for australian angus-new zealand jersey to  <dig>  for dutch holstein-black and white. at increasing marker distance, correlation of phase for the pig breeds in this study decreased . this decrease however was less than the decrease de roos et al.  <cit>  observed in all but two of the cattle breeds they considered . while correlation of phase was similar between these pig breeds and dairy cattle at short range , the pig breeds showed generally larger correlation of phase than the dairy cattle  <cit>  at increasing marker distances.

if two populations diverged from a common ancestral population, their correlation of phase can be expressed as r022t, where r <dig> is a measure of ld in the common ancestral population, c is the recombination distance between markers and t is time since breed divergence in generations  <cit> . for markers as close as  <dig> kb the recombination distance c will be almost  <dig>  so that correlation of phase at those short distances can serve as an estimation of r <dig> in the common ancestral population. since correlation of phase was comparable in the pig populations  for markers with pairwise distance below  <dig> kb to that reported in australian cattle   <cit> , ld in the common ancestral pig population is likely to be similar to that in the common ancestral population of australian cattle breeds. larger correlation of phase at increasing marker distance  in the pig populations used in this study  compared to australian cattle breeds  suggests that t is smaller in our pig breeds than it is in the cattle breeds. the expected correlation of r between two breeds can be expressed as e-2ct  <cit> . to estimate the time since breed divergence for the pig breeds in this study we used snp with pairwise distance between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, and estimated correlation of phase for each  <dig>  kb interval. we calculated the linear regression of the natural logarithm of the estimated correlation of phase onto the average pairwise distance c. the slope of this regression is an estimate of -2t. consequently, the slope divided by - <dig> is the number of generations  since these two breeds have diverged  <cit> . results suggest that the pig breeds in this study diverged approximately 40- <dig> generations ago. the expected correlation of phase would decrease to  <dig>  and  <dig>  at  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm distance respectively in the yorkshire-landrace comparison, assuming t of  <dig> and r <dig> of  <dig> . we observed a correlation of phase of  <dig>  and  <dig>  at  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb, respectively, between these two breeds, indicating that a t of  <dig> may overestimate the actual time since breed divergence. one possible cause of this observation is admixture between these two breeds, causing more common ld between them than what would be expected from fully diverged breeds  <cit> . we obtained the date of herd book closure for each of the breeds in this study, and assuming a generation interval of approximately  <dig> years  <cit> , duroc, hampshire, landrace, and yorkshire have existed as distinct breeds for at least  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  generations, respectively. the time of herd book closure does not directly indicate the time since breed divergence, since distinguishable breeds must have existed before herd book closure. nevertheless, the time of herd book closure further supports our observation that landrace and yorkshire have developed as separate breeds later than duroc and hampshire.

implications of estimated levels of ld for gebv implementation
our results have several important implications for future implementation of genomic selection in swine. accuracy of prediction of genome wide marker assisted selection can be directly affected by the chosen marker density , and the size of the training population  <cit> .

the currently used marker panel, containing approximately  <dig>  usable markers, had average r <dig> of approximately  <dig>  between adjacent markers for all four breeds. that exceeds the level of r <dig> =  <dig>  simulated by meuwissen et al.  <cit>  to reach prediction gevb accuracy around  <dig> . furthermore, our results indicated that reducing the original marker panel to 10% of the markers  still resulted in average r <dig> for adjacent markers exceeding  <dig>  in all four breeds. on the other hand, recent research in australian holstein friesian cattle has shown  <cit>  that using subsets of 3000- <dig> snp to estimate direct genomic breeding values  could only reach 80% of the prediction accuracy previously estimated using approximately  <dig>  snp. such a reduction in prediction accuracy will be unacceptable for most practical implementations. however, the accuracy of gebv predicted by low density panels can be increased through the use of genotype imputation  <cit> , where high density genotypes are imputed using low density snp genotypes and a high density reference panel of haplotypes  <cit> . weigel et al.  <cit>  used approximately 10% of  <dig>  snp from bos taurus chromosome  <dig> to impute the full snp set in a jersey population. they found that using a high density reference genotype panel , the imputation accuracy of the non-typed markers was between  <dig>  and  <dig> . average r <dig> in our populations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for markers less than  <dig> kb apart, comparable to average r <dig> =  <dig>  for markers spaced at <  <dig> kb in the jersey population  <cit> . assuming a comparable decline of ld for increasing marker distance between the jersey population and our pig populations, we would expect to accurately impute approximately 90% of the high density genotypes, using a low density panel containing 10% of the markers. more recent results reported even higher average accuracy of imputation  when imputing  <dig>  snp in the bovine  <dig> k using the  <dig> k subset in holstein cattle  <cit> . to assess the accuracy of gebv estimated from imputed genotypes weigel et al.  <cit> , used the same jersey population from their previous study  <cit> , and they found that the accuracy of gebv based on imputed markers was 95% of the accuracy of the gebv estimated using the observed genotypes  <cit> . as noted above average r <dig> is similar between the american jersey population and our pig populations, suggesting that future research in genomic selection in swine should explore the use of imputed low density genotypes to increase cost efficiency. previous research in humans  <cit> , and european holstein cattle  <cit>  indicated that combining haplotypes from closely related populations can increase the accuracy of genotype imputation, while research in sheep suggests that breed specific reference haplotypes would yield better accuracy  <cit> . the success of combined haplotypes for genotype imputation depends on the relatedness between the populations. further research is necessary to determine if persistence of phase is large enough in our pig populations to increase imputation accuracy when combining reference haplotypes across breeds. as noted by goddard  <cit> , the accuracy of gebv prediction can be expressed as a function of the ld between marker and qtl and the accuracy of estimated snp effects. the loss in accuracy of gevb prediction caused by imputing instead of observing genotypes could be compensated by increasing the number of animals used to estimate snp effects. if not enough animals are available for the estimation of snp effects, animals from different, but closely related, populations could be combined to estimate snp effects for gebv prediction in both populations  <cit> . the squared short-range  correlation of phase can also serve as the accuracy with which we can predict a marker-qtl association in one population using known marker-qtl associations from another population. for the pig breeds reported in this study the squared correlation of phase for close markers  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . to evaluate whether these accuracies would warrant the use of a combined training population to estimate snp effects accurately for both populations we refer to a simulation study conducted by de roos et al.  <cit>  estimating the accuracy of gebv prediction for combined training populations of highly, moderately and lowly related populations. correlation of phase for populations diverged approximately t= <dig> generations ago was reported to be below  <dig>  for markers with pairwise distance below  <dig>  cm  <cit> . we found correlation of phase between landrace-yorkshire of around  <dig>  at a corresponding marker distance. de roos et al.  <cit>  concluded that reliability of gebv prediction could be increased between  <dig> - <dig>  points in two populations, when approximately  <dig>  marker genotypes are available, heritability is h2= <dig>  or higher,  <dig> animals from each population were used to estimate snp effects, and under the assumption that qtl effects are the same for both populations  <cit> . in addition, they found that for genetically distant populations, at least  <dig>  animals with genotypes and phenotypes available in each population were needed to avoid a decrease in the reliability of prediction  <cit> . when snp effects estimated in one population are used to calculate gebv for another population which diverged approximately t= <dig> generations ago, the reliability of the predicted gebv was  <dig>  assuming both high marker density  and heritability h <dig> =  <dig>  <cit> . consequently, combining animals into a multi-breed panel to estimate snp effects is likely to be only marginally beneficial for the pig breeds in this study, given the estimated correlation of phase and the large number of animals and markers required  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we used the porcinesnp <dig> chip  <cit>  to obtain high density genotypes  from pig trios in four breeds. from this data we estimated r <dig> as a measure of ld across the genome as well as correlation of r, which measures phase agreement between breeds. we found r <dig> of approximately  <dig>  for markers less than  <dig> kb apart, which is higher than comparable estimates reported for north american holstein cattle  <cit>  as well as various australian cattle breeds  <cit> . the same was true for average r <dig> between markers with pairwise distance larger than  <dig> mb, indicating a smaller past effective population size of these pig breeds. we also report a relatively slow rate of decay of ld over distance, observing r <dig> around  <dig>  at  <dig> mb. the comparably high long range ld is an indicator that good accuracy can be expected for future implementations of gebv in pigs using 10%  of the snp used in the current assay or less, along with genotype imputation. we would encourage future research in genomic selection in swine to especially focus on the possible benefits of the combined use of reduced marker panels and genotype imputation. to successfully promote the use of genomic selection in swine it will be necessary to increase cost efficiency while maintaining high accuracy of prediction. currently no low density panels for snp genotyping are publicly available for swine, but the presented results will be available to aid in the development of efficient snp platforms. relatively low persistence of phase reported here implies that the use of multi-breed panels estimating snp effects for genomic selection will likely be limited, especially when using low density genotypes, but the merit of combining reference haplotypes for genotype imputation should be further investigated.
