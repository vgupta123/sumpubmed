BACKGROUND
tuberous sclerosis complex  is an autosomal dominant tumor disorder that affects multiple organs, including the heart, lungs, brain, skin, and kidneys  <cit>  and occurs at a frequency of about 1: <dig>  <cit> . it has been estimated that 60–80% of tsc patients develop kidney angiomyolipomas  <cit> . a number of other medical issues, such as skin lesions , seizures, cognitive impairment, cortical tubers, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and in postpubertal females, tsc-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis , are also common in tsc patients <cit> .

tsc is caused by a loss of function of one of two genes, tsc <dig> or tsc <dig> <cit> . the products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, function to negatively regulate mtor in the highly conserved mtor signaling pathway  <cit> . when tuberin and/or hamartin are absent or nonfunctional, mtor is constitutively active and its downstream effectors, p <dig> s <dig> kinase , s <dig> ribosomal subunit  and eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein  <dig>  are hyperphosphorylated, which results in increased cell growth, cell proliferation, and survival <cit> . using compounds designed to inhibit mtor is a common strategy in the investigation of possible treatments for tsc.

rapamycin  is an fda-approved mtor inhibitor currently used to prevent rejection of solid organ transplants  <cit> . rapamycin and its analogs have been successfully used to treat tsc-related lesions in rodent models  <cit>  and rapamycin is currently being evaluated for its safety and efficacy in treating tsc-related lesions in human populations <cit> . the mtor pathway is also important in oncogenesis as pten, a tumor suppressor that functions upstream of mtor, is mutated in many brain, prostate and other tumors <cit> . therefore, there is significant effort toward evaluating mtor inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. there are currently four mtor inhibitors  being evaluated in a variety of malignancies including cancers of the brain, kidney, breast, ovaries, and lung as well as in leukemia and lymphoma  <cit> . cci- <dig>  is now fda-approved for the treatment of advanced renal cancer, and there is also some evidence for response to cci- <dig> in glioblastomas, metastatic breast cancer, mantel cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and kaposi's sarcoma  <cit> .

the cytokine interferon-gamma  is another potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of tsc. it has been shown that the presence of a high-expressing ifn-γ allele significantly reduces the burden of kidney tumors in tsc2+/- mice relative to that of tsc2+/- mice with normal ifn-γ levels <cit> . we have also observed an association between the presence of a high-expressing ifn-γ allele and reduced frequency of kidney angiomyolipomas in a cohort of human tsc patients  <cit> .

recently, we demonstrated that exogenous ifn-γ is an effective single agent in the treatment of tsc-related lesions in mouse models  <cit>  and the combination of cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ was more effective than single agents in a nude mouse model  <cit> . in our prior study, we showed that increased cell death along with decreased cell proliferation are important mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of combination treatment in a nude mouse model for tsc-related tumors. here, we have used tsc2+/- mice to investigate the effects of treatment with cci- <dig> or a combination of cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ at different time periods. we have also directly compared the efficacy of rapamycin with that of cci- <dig> in a tsc2-/- tumor-bearing mouse model.

RESULTS
timing of treatment and combination therapy in tsc2+/- mice
tsc2+/- mice were used for a seven-arm preclinical study to determine the impact of the timing of treatment for tsc renal disease and to compare treatment with cci- <dig> to cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ. the arms of the study are as listed in table  <dig>  all mice receiving drug treatment were treated for a two-month time period . because the primary goals were to evaluate timing of treatment with an mtor inhibitor, and comparison of treatment with an mtor inhibitor to the combination of an mtor inhibitor plus ifn-γ, a group treated with single agent ifn-γ was not included in this experiment. the severity of kidney disease was evaluated using quantitative histopathology to obtain total lesion counts  and total kidney scores  as described in methods. because the development of kidney cystadenomas in tsc2+/- mice is age-dependent, disease severity was evaluated at age  <dig> weeks in all mice. to illustrate the timing of the genesis of kidney tumors in this mouse strain, the same methods were used to quantitate severity of kidney disease in six untreated mice  at each of three additional time points .

compared with untreated controls, a significantly lowered burden of disease was observed, as evaluated both by tumor number and by tumor score, in all mice treated from 6– <dig> or 10– <dig> months of age, regardless of treatment . treatment with cci- <dig> or the combination of cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ from 2– <dig> months was not effective. there was no significant difference between the 6– <dig> month cohort versus the 10– <dig> month cohort. furthermore, no benefit was observed from adding ifn-γ to cci- <dig> at any treatment time point. the lack of improvement with the combination therapy in this study using tsc2+/- mice differs from the results we have previously reported in nude mice bearing tsc2-/- tumors  <cit> . as shown , there are few kidney cystadenomas in untreated tsc2+/- mice at  <dig> months but they are easily observed at  <dig> months and the severity of kidney disease increases by  <dig> months.

subgroup analysis by kidney lesion type  in treated and untreated tsc2+/- cohorts)
although we refer to all tsc2+/- mouse kidney lesions collectively as cystadenomas, they can be subdivided into  <dig> subtypes: cystic lesions, papillary lesions, and solid tumors . to investigate genesis of kidney cystadenomas in untreated tsc2+/- mice as well as the impact of treatment on cystadenoma subtype, kidney lesions were scored according to cystadenoma subtype . this subgroup data is shown for all treated and untreated tsc2+/- cohorts in figure  <dig>  cystic lesions were observed to be the most common subtype in all cohorts. the untreated cohorts euthanized at different ages show that there tends to be an upward trend in all subtypes of kidney lesions between the ages of  <dig> to  <dig> months. although treatment from 2– <dig> months was not significantly different than untreated controls, it is interesting to note that in the 2– <dig> month single agent cci- <dig> cohort, there are fewer kidney lesions of all subtypes than the 2– <dig> month cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ cohort. in the cohorts treated from 6– <dig> months, there are reduced numbers of cystic and solid lesions, but not of papillary lesions . when compared with the  <dig> month untreated cohort, there are similar numbers of cysts, papillary and solid lesions. in cohorts treated from 10– <dig> months, there are reduced numbers of cystic, papillary and solid lesions compared with the  <dig> and  <dig> month untreated cohorts. this data suggests that treatment with either cci- <dig> alone or in combination with ifn-γ causes regression of all types of lesions . it therefore seems most likely that in the 6– <dig> month treated cohort, there is regression followed by regrowth of all lesion types.

timing of treatment and rapamycin vs. cci- <dig> in a nude mouse model of tsc
a nude mouse model of tsc was used to further investigate the impact of the timing of treatment and to compare rapamycin treatment to cci- <dig>  as described previously <cit> , nude mice were given subcutaneous injections of ntc/t2null cells  in the dorsal flank to induce development of tsc-related tumors. mice were assigned to one of the following four treatment cohorts when their tumors reached the prescribed volume for their cohort: untreated , early rapamycin treatment , late rapamycin , and early cci- <dig> . tumor volumes were measured and treatment was given daily monday through friday. all mice were euthanized when tumors exceeded  <dig> mm <dig>  to compare the cohorts, day  <dig> for mice in the early cci- <dig> and early rapamycin treatment cohorts was taken to be the day the mouse received its first treatment and day  <dig> for mice in the untreated and late rapamycin treatment cohorts was taken to be the day on which that mouse had a tumor volume of approximately  <dig> mm <dig>  two methods were used to evaluate efficacy of drug treatment in the nude mouse model. average tumor volumes were plotted for each cohort at all time points with  <dig> or more data points for treated cohorts and  <dig> or more data points for the untreated control cohort. the unpaired t test was used to compare tumor volumes from different cohorts on the last day on which there were  <dig> or more mice with tumor measurements . survival analysis was done by determining time to tumor size of  <dig> mm <dig> because animals with large tumors require euthanasia according to institutional animal care guidelines.

as expected, all treatments significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival . at day  <dig>  the average tumor volumes of the early cci-779-treated cohort  and the early rapamycin-treated cohort  were lower than that of the untreated cohort . at day  <dig>  the late rapamycin-treated cohort  also had a lower tumor volume than the untreated cohort . mantel-cox logrank analysis shows improved survival in all three treatment cohorts when compared with untreated controls.

to investigate treatment timing using this tsc mouse model, the early rapamycin cohort was compared to the late rapamycin cohort . although the early rapamycin cohort was observed to have a significantly lower tumor volume than the late rapamycin cohort on day  <dig> , there was no improvement in survival. the late rapamycin-treated cohort grew more sharply than the early rapamycin-treated cohort until approximately day  <dig>  when the average tumor volume of the late rapamycin cohort reached  <dig> mm <dig> and the mice in this cohort began to receive treatment; at this point, the average tumor volume of the late rapamycin cohort decreased until approximately day  <dig> when the average volume stabilized and the tumors entered a stage of progressive growth . from this point on, the growth curves of the two cohorts remained similar.

cci- <dig> is an injectable ester analog of rapamycin. it is more soluble than rapamycin and is known to be converted to rapamycin after injection <cit> . because we have used cci- <dig> in our prior preclinical studies <cit>  and we are currently using rapamycin in an ongoing clinical trial <cit> , we were interested in comparing cci- <dig> to rapamycin using our nude mouse model of tsc. as shown in figure  <dig>  early rapamycin treatment was compared with early cci- <dig> treatment. both drugs were given at  <dig> mg/kg five days per week . although both drugs are effective when compared with untreated control , rapamycin was more effective than cci- <dig> in reducing tumor growth and improving survival. tumor volume at day  <dig> was  <dig> ±  <dig> mm <dig> for the cci- <dig> cohort and  <dig> ±  <dig> mm <dig> for the rapamycin cohort . the median survival was  <dig> days for the cci- <dig> cohort and  <dig> days for the rapamycin cohort .

rapamycin levels in different tissues after treatment with rapamycin or cci-779
rapamycin levels were measured in cohorts of mice treated with either rapamycin or cci- <dig> in order to investigate the tissue distribution of rapamycin and to compare levels after treatment with rapamycin vs. cci- <dig>  all mice in this experiment were given either rapamycin or cci- <dig> at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg via intraperitoneal  injection daily for four days to achieve steady state drug levels and to approximate the conditions of the nude mouse experiment. rapamycin levels were measured in blood, brain, and kidney tissue from nude mice without tumors after either 2– <dig> hours or  <dig> hours after drug treatment . these time points were selected based on pharmacokinetics of rapamycin and cci- <dig> in humans and pilot studies of rapamycin blood levels in mice. in humans, rapamycin levels are known to peak 1– <dig> hours after oral dosing of rapamycin  <cit>  and  <dig> – <dig>  hours after cci- <dig> injection  <cit> . with rapamycin treatment in humans, there is an excellent correlation between  <dig> hour trough drug levels and area under the time-concentration curve   <cit> . in pilot mouse studies of rapamycin level measurements done at 2– <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours after injection with rapamycin or cci- <dig>  measured rapamycin blood levels were highest at the 2– <dig> hour time point following treatment with either drug .

*drug levels from rapamycin cohort compared with cci- <dig> cohort for indicated tissue and time point, ns = not significant.

**tumor drug levels from early cci- <dig> cohort and late rapamycin cohort were compared with early rapamycin cohort, ns = not significant

rapamycin levels were also measured in four tumors from each cohort from the nude mouse experiment . the results are shown in fig. 7c and table 2b. at 2– <dig> hours after drug treatment, the average rapamycin concentration was similar in blood and kidney tissue, but lower in brain tissue. at 2– <dig> hours, rapamycin levels were ~ <dig> times higher in blood and kidneys from the rapamycin-treated animals compared with the cci-779-treated animals . interestingly, at 2– <dig> hours, rapamycin levels were 7– <dig> times higher in brain tissue from the rapamycin-treated animals compared with the cci-779-treated animals . at 2– <dig> hours, blood rapamycin levels were  <dig> – <dig>  times higher in blood compared with tumor tissue after treatment with either rapamycin or cci- <dig> 

at  <dig> hours after rapamycin treatment, rapamycin concentration was highest in kidney tissue and similar in blood and brain tissue with brain > blood. at  <dig> hours after cci- <dig> treatment, rapamycin levels were higher in kidney tissue than in brain and blood with blood > brain. at  <dig> hours, rapamycin levels were  <dig> – <dig>  times higher in blood and kidneys from the rapamycin-treated animals compared with the cci-779-treated animals. interestingly, at  <dig> hours, rapamycin levels were 4– <dig> times higher in brain tissue from the rapamycin-treated animals compared with the cci-779-treated animals .

these results show that average rapamycin levels in all tissues are higher after rapamycin treatment compared with cci- <dig> treatment at both 2– <dig> hours and  <dig> hours. because cci- <dig> is converted to rapamycin, it is not surprising to see that the tissue levels of rapamycin differ significantly at the early time point. it is interesting to see that comparison of rapamycin treated and cci- <dig> treated animals at  <dig> hours shows that differences in rapamycin levels are not significant in blood and kidney tissue. despite the similarity in blood and kidney levels, the brain rapamycin concentrations are significantly higher after rapamycin injection.

discussion
the tsc2+/- mouse is a useful model for the kidney angiomyolipomas that develop in tsc. both the renal cystadenomas that occur in tsc2+/- mice and kidney angiomyolipomas that occur in individuals with tsc tend not to be present at young ages but develop over time. in our preclinical study using tsc2+/- mice, we sought to evaluate the importance of timing of a two-month treatment period with either cci- <dig> or cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ. our results show that if treatment is initiated prior to the appearance of the kidney lesions , the treatment was not effective. once kidney lesions are present, a two-month course of treatment does reduce kidney disease severity, but there was no difference between treating at 6– <dig> months versus 10– <dig> months. our data suggests that there is cystadenoma regression then regrowth in the cohort treated at 6– <dig> months, raising the possibility that there may be benefit to longer term treatment or continuing a lower maintenance dose to reduce regrowth of kidney lesions.

there are three studies showing that ifn-γ as a single agent may be a useful therapeutic agent for tsc kidney disease  <cit> . in a mouse genetic study, the frequency of kidney tumors was dramatically reduced in tsc2+/- mice engineered to express high levels of endogenous ifn-γ  <cit> . in a genetic association study, we demonstrated that a high expressing allele for ifn-γ is associated with a lower frequency of kidney angiomyolipomas in patients with known tsc <dig> mutations  <cit> . these genetic data in mice and humans suggest that long term exposure to high levels of ifn-γ may be required for ifn-γ to reduce the severity of tsc related kidney disease. in our prior preclinical study using tsc2+/- mice  <cit> , single agent ifn-γ was administered for  <dig> months  and there was significant reduction in the severity of kidney disease. we have previously compared the combination of cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ with single agent cci- <dig> and single agent ifn-γ in nude mice bearing tsc2-/- tumors and found a significant reduction in tumor growth and improved survival with combination therapy  <cit> . in contrast, here we evaluated combination cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ using tsc2+/- mice and found no benefit to adding the ifn-γ to cci- <dig> in this study. after considering the details of these relevant prior studies, we conclude that this discrepancy is likely due to the shorter ifn-γ treatment duration  compared with our prior study  using tsc2+/- mice, along with insufficient power to detect a minor difference between the groups. a comparison of our prior studies using nude mice bearing tsc-related tumors also suggests that early treatment with ifn-γ yields a better response. in lee et al.,  <dig> we treated animals on day  <dig> after tsc2-/- cells were injected and tumors were small  and we observed a dramatic improvement with ifn-γ treatment. in lee et al.,  <dig>  the study design differed as ifn-γ treatment was initiated when subcutaneous tumors were significantly larger , and although single agent ifn-γ was still somewhat effective, the response was subtle. in the tsc2+/- study reported here, we observed that the combination treatment cohort had a lower cystadenoma score than the single-agent cci- <dig> cohort in both the 6– <dig> month and 10– <dig> month groups, although this difference was not statistically significant . it is possible that early and prolonged ifn-γ treatment along with larger cohorts might allow us to observe a difference between combination treatment versus single-agent cci- <dig> treatment in tsc2+/- mice, and these issues will be considered in the design of future preclinical studies. it was surprising to see that when we compare the group treated with single agent cci- <dig> from 2– <dig> months to the group treated with cci- <dig> plus ifn-γ from 2– <dig> months, single agent cci- <dig> looks significantly better than combination treatment . this finding is puzzling as it is not consistent with other treatment time points in this study or findings in our prior studies on combination therapy, and we do not have a good explanation for this difference. since neither 2– <dig> month treatment group differed significantly from the untreated control group, we conclude that the difference between cci- <dig> and combination treatment at this time is not important.

loss of heterozygosity has been observed in kidney angiomyolipomas <cit>  and subependymal giant cell tumors <cit> . because tsc is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome, nude mice bearing tsc2-/- tumors are a useful generic model for tsc-related tumors. we used this model to investigate treatment timing and to compare two mtor inhibitors. in our comparison of treatment initiated at tumor size of  <dig> mm <dig> vs. tumor size of  <dig> mm <dig>  we found that there was a statistically significant reduction in tumor volume with earlier rapamycin treatment but no survival advantage. in the later rapamycin treatment cohort, the tumors underwent regression then regrowth. this is evidence that there is response followed by development of resistance. we have shown previously that progressive tumor growth occurs even though the mtor pathway is inhibited   <cit> . although dramatic benefit of earlier treatment was not observed in this experiment, there may be a slight advantage of earlier treatment as we did observe a reduction of tumor volume in the early treatment cohort.

because our prior preclinical studies have used the rapamycin analog, cci- <dig>  and rapamycin is being used in ongoing clinical trials, we sought to demonstrate that rapamycin and cci- <dig> were equally effective using our nude mouse model for tsc. to our surprise, we found that although both drugs were effective, rapamycin was more effective than cci- <dig> when given at the identical dose  as demonstrated by reduced tumor growth and improved survival. since cci- <dig> is an ester analog of rapamycin that is known to be a prodrug which is converted to rapamycin after injection <cit> , we evaluated rapamycin levels in blood, brain, tumor and kidneys after injection with either rapamycin or cci- <dig>  we found that average rapamycin levels are higher in blood, kidneys, brain, and tumor tissue 2– <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after rapamycin treatment compared with cci- <dig> treatment. at  <dig> hours, the difference in rapamycin levels from the two treatment groups was statistically significant only in brain tissue and not in blood or kidney tissue. although a more detailed analysis with additional time points and larger numbers of animals is required to understand the pharmacokinetic and phamacodynamic properties of rapamycin versus cci- <dig> in nude mice, our observation that average rapamycin levels are higher after rapamycin treatment at both 2– <dig> hours and  <dig> hours in all tissues is consistent with our finding that rapamycin is more effective than cci- <dig>  as measured by tumor growth and survival analysis in nude mice bearing tsc-related tumors. these results coupled with the fact that rapamycin has been approved for human use for many years and consequently has a well-known toxicity profile make rapamycin our first choice of mtor inhibitors for future tsc clinical trials. if neurologic toxicity is observed with rapamycin in human tsc studies, our results suggest that cci- <dig> may be a useful alternative.

CONCLUSIONS
in both the tsc2+/- mouse model and nude mouse model for tsc tumors, the timing of initiation of mtor inhibitor treatment of tsc-related tumors does not appear to be important, provided that tumors are actively growing at the time treatment is initiated. attempting to prevent the genesis of kidney lesions in tsc2+/- mice using short term mtor inhibitor treatment is not an effective strategy. treatment with a combination of ifn-γ and an mtor inhibitor for two months did not prove to be more effective than an mtor inhibitor alone in tsc2+/- mice. this result differs from our findings in the nude mouse tumor model  <cit>  and could be due to the shorter duration of ifn-γ therapy used here in tsc2+/- mice. finally, rapamycin proved to be more effective than its analog cci- <dig> at equal doses. rapamycin treatment results in higher brain, kidney and tumor levels of rapamycin than treatment with an equal dose of cci- <dig>  as tsc is a multi-system disorder that affects the brain, kidneys and other organs, depending on tsc disease manifestations and toxicity profile, it may ultimately be advantageous to have mtor inhibitors with differing tissue distribution profiles. we anticipate these preclinical studies will influence the design of future preclinical studies and clinical trials for tsc.
