BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is a devastating swine disease  <cit>  associated with reproductive failure, growth decrease  <cit>  and a drop in spermatogenesis  <cit> . prrsv is a member of arteriviridae virus family, in the order of nidovirales, and it has a 15 kb single stranded rna genome that encodes nine open reading frames . the orfs 1a and 1b encode the non-structural proteins nsp1a, nsp1b, and nsp2- <dig>  while orf2a, orf2b, orfs 3– <dig> and orf5a encode the structural proteins gp2a, gp2b, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  m, n and orf5a-protein, respectively  <cit> .

prrs viruses have high biological diversity, and two main genotypes are recognised: the genotype  <dig>  and genotype  <dig>  types  <cit> . all italian prrsv strains were of genotype  <dig> and exhibited high nucleotide variability  <cit> . prrsv can be transmitted via semen  <cit> , contact between pigs  <cit> , contaminated transport vehicles  <cit>  and aerial spread  <cit> . clarification of the mechanisms of the virus spread and differentiation by study of the relationship between genetic, geographical and temporal variability of prrsv may help in the development of better strategies to control the prrsv spread.  <cit> .

in order to study the genetic basis and the epidemiology of prrsv we monitored  <dig> farms in northern italy through the period 2006– <dig> . we created a database collecting genotypes, phenotypes and genealogic data from pure breed pigs and established a bio-repository containing more than  <dig>  pig samples. a total of  <dig> litters were monitored during the project.

in this study we compared the nucleotide variability among prrsv strains isolated during the three years project by sequencing samples from all  <dig> litters that where positive for prrsv. therefore, we analysed the relationship between the prrsv genetic diversity from one side and the geographical and temporal distances of the prrsv sampling from the other side. moreover the effect of the glycosylation pattern of the prrsv gp <dig> on the pathogenicity of the virus and on pigs adg within different breeds was studied.

methods
sampling
serum samples were collected by veterinarians from different farms located in the north of italy . representative farms rearing purebred pigs  in lombardy region were chosen based on size, housing, and management .farms were included in the project if they were positive for prrsv and they had at least two pure pig breeds. in each farm, veterinarians took serum samples from at least  <dig> piglets from each litter. serum samples collected during the weaning phase  were used for the analyses. for each animal, the adg  was calculated from 5– <dig> to 25–30 days after birth, defined as adg <dig> and from 25– <dig> to 45– <dig> after birth and defined as adg <dig>  all samples were collected between january  <dig> and march  <dig>  samples were added to the prrs bio-repository  <cit>  which presently contains more than  <dig>  samples collected from pigs in these farms.

rna extraction, pcr diagnostic and nucleotide sequencing
viral rna was extracted immediately from serum using high pure viral rna kit  and stored at −80 °c. presence or absence of prrsv was determined by multiplex pcr of conserved regions of viral orf <dig> using primers and conditions previously described  <cit> . one positive sample per litter was chosen to analyse the rna sequence. pcr conditions for sequence all orf <dig> and orf <dig> were previously described  <cit> . pcr products were sequenced using the big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit  following the manufactories instructions, run and analysed on an abi  <dig> dna analyser . all products were sequenced in both directions. this study was exempt as serum sampling from pigs is a part of routine care and does not need an ethical approval.

analysis of sequences, phylogenetic relationships and n-glycosylation sites
sequences were compared with the lelystad virus  which was used as a reference using bioedit , sequence alignments were carried out using clustalx  <cit> . we used the modelgenerator  <cit>  program to construct the phylogenetic trees for orf <dig> and orf <dig>  this software spans through  <dig> different models for phylogenetic trees constructions. in this analysis, the best model was chosen based on likelihood ratio. the best fitting tree was estimated by feeding into the program phyml  <cit>  the input parameters from modelgenerator. genetic distances between aligned sequences were estimated according to a specific substitution model using tree-puzzle  <cit> .

the entropy approach  <cit> , which measures the uncertainty at each position relative to other positions in a specific alignment, was used to assess the variability along the orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences. the n-glycosylation sites in orf <dig> sequences were identify using the netnglyc  <dig>  software  <cit> .

spatial and temporal trend analysis
latitude and longitude coordinates were used to calculate the distance between farms in kilometres  using the great-circle formula  <cit> . in every analysis one sequence from each litter was selected by random sampling.

correlation between genetic and spatial distances was calculated using the mantel correlation statistic  based on the spearman correlation coefficient  <cit> . as values in the distance matrix were not independent, the test was based on a permutation procedure using  <dig> random re-samplings. the partial mantel test was used to compare two distance matrices correcting for the third one  <cit> . p-values for the mantel tests are one-sided, i.e. the null hypothesis assumes rm equal to  <dig> 

in order to account for the presence of several piglets from the same farm and therefore to remove the farm clustering effect, a bootstrap estimate with  <dig> re-sampling of rm was calculated using sequences from each farm. the average correlation coefficient for data stratified within farms was calculated following  <cit> .

analysis of prrsv transmission by semen
the effect of commercial semen on prrs virus transmission was evaluated using a permutation test manova  <cit>  accounting for the farm and semen source as effects. p-values were calculated based on  <dig> permutations.

all the statistical analysis were performed using the r environment   <cit>  using functions implemented in the packages vegan, ecodist and ape.

associations between prrsv glycosylation patterns, prrsv infectivity and pigs adg
the percentage of prrs positive piglets in each litter, determined by diagnostic pcr was used as an estimate of the prrsv infection capacity. two prrsv glycosylation patterns of the orf <dig> were considered: 1) orf <dig> with n-linked glycosylation site n <dig>  and 2) orf <dig> without n-linked glycosylation site n <dig> . interestingly, the n <dig> glycosylation site has been found to be associated with the prrsv infectivity  <cit> .

association analyses were performed using the general linear model y = xβ + e, implemented in the r statistical software. y represented either a quantitative variable  or a binomial variable . β is the vector of fixed factors which included: farm, breed effects, and depending on the analysis, also included either the percentage of infection and/or adg. x is the matrix of indices for the fixed effects; e is a vector of the residual random errors, which were assumed to be normally distributed. correlations among quantitative variables  were estimated using the pearson method.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis and clustering of sequences orf <dig> and orf7
using the diagnostic pcr a total of  <dig> litters was positive for the prrs virus. a total of  <dig> orf <dig> sequences from  <dig> litters and  <dig> orf <dig> sequences from  <dig> litters were generated. the orf5/orf <dig> sequences pertain to large white , duroc , landrace and pietrain  breeds. the orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences came from  <dig> and  <dig> farms, respectively. the average distance between farms was  <dig>  km, ranging from  <dig>  km to  <dig>  km.

the sequences for orf <dig> and orf <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively. to construct the corresponding phylogenetic trees, two different nucleotide substitution models were used for orf <dig> and orf <dig>  for orf <dig> the nucleotide substitution model hky  <cit>  gave the best fit, while for orf <dig> the best model was the k2p + i + g  <cit> . a distance matrix calculated using hky modelgenerator estimated a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig> , a proportion of invariable sites as 36% and nucleotide frequencies: a =  <dig>  %, c =  <dig>  %, g =  <dig> % t =  <dig>  %. a discrete-gamma model with  <dig> categories was used to account for the variable substitution rates among sites, with shape parameter  <dig> . similarly for the k2p model, a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig> , a proportion of invariable sites of 29% and a gamma shape of  <dig>  were used. the trees resulting from maximum likelihood optimization for orf <dig> and orf <dig> respectively showed a strong clustering by farm .

all orf <dig> sequences were of european genotype prrsv- <dig> having coding for a protein of  <dig> amino acids. phylogenetic trees for the orf <dig> and orf <dig> split the prrsv isolates mainly depending on farm which might suggest the combination of prrs strain  and farm effect on prrsv strains evolution. orf <dig> and orf <dig> had entropy of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively and showed  <dig> and  <dig> conserved regions, respectively . to evaluate the genetic diversity of the prrsv italian strains, we used the average pairwise genetic distance  between orf <dig> sequences of the prrsv isolates, a standard methodology usually used for this scope  <cit> . the prrsv strains showed an average pairwise distance  equal to  <dig>  . this value is higher than that reported for other european strains  <cit> .

identification of orf <dig> glycosylation sites
the lelystad reference prrs virus has two glycosylation sites on the gp <dig> protein: “n46” and “n53”. approximately, 79%  of the italian isolates sequenced in this study carried three glycosylation sites at positions n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  around 4%  had the first glycosylation site at position n <dig> and other two sites at n <dig> and n <dig>  only  <dig> %  of the isolates had the  <dig> glycosylation sites of the lelystad strain . interestingly 15%  were missing the glycosylation site at position  <dig>  changing the asparagine to aspartic acid. a similar distribution of glycosylation sites was found in  <dig> italian sequences present in ncbi  in which 73% had the glycosylation sites at positions n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  with only 3% missing the glycosylation site at position n <dig> 

note the domination of the aa glycosylation pattern in all the breeds.

seven glycosylation patterns  have been found in italian breeds. note the domination of the aa glycosylation pattern in all the breeds.

correlations between genetic, geographical and temporal distances
the correlation between prrsv strains genetic distance and the geographic distance between the sites from which the isolates had been sampled were significant for both orf <dig> and orf <dig>   when we did not consider the farm effect in the model. to account for the effect of the farm and collection time disparities , a partial mantel test was used to correct for farm and time. the associations between the genetic distance and the geographical distance were not statistically significant either for orf <dig>  or orf <dig> . this suggests that the positive correlation between the genetic distance and geographical distance might be a function of within farm clustering. to test the latter hypothesis, a permutation test was performed that randomly sampled one sequence from each farm and calculated the corresponding rm . the median rm was not significantly different from zero  which means that there is no significant correlation between the genetic and geographical distances when the farm factor was taken into consideration.

using the same approach, the relationship between temporal  and genetic distances was assessed. a partial mantel correlation was performed to account for the farm . furthermore, to allow for a sufficient number of permutations only farms with at least  <dig> sequences were considered. in this case orf <dig> and orf <dig> genetic diversity is highly correlated with sampling time .

prrsv transmission by semen
semen as a source of prrs was evaluated using a multivariate anova where the variability in prrs sequence on a farm were correlated with semen vendor used by that farm. if one or more semen producer is a source of prrsv contamination we would expect that the prrsv sequences extracted from piglets which were born from such semen would be more similar than other sequences originated from piglets born from another semen producer. four semen producers were used by the farms sampled, though 55% of the semen was of local farm origin as the main source of sequence clustering is the farm itself, in the model we accounted for a farm effect. no significant effect was found either for orf <dig>  or orf <dig> .

associations between glycosylation patterns, prrsv strains infectivity and pig growth
the glycosylation site n <dig> was associated with adg <dig>  although this was not statistically significant . animals infected with prrsv strains glycosylated at position n <dig>  had a lower adg <dig>  than animals infected with prrsv strains lacking this glycosylation  site . the pietrain breed that was present mainly in one farm with another two breeds, was infected preferentially by prrsv n46+ . however, this finding needs to be confirmed with larger sample of the pietrain breed.

no significant association was found between the glycosylation site n <dig> and the percentage of infected pigs in the litter. using the pearson correlation, we found that adg <dig> was positively correlated to the percentage of piglets infected by prrsv n46- strains  but not in the animals infected by prrsv n46+ strains . moreover, the percentage of landrace pigs infected with prrsv was low compared with the other breeds  , suggesting a higher resistance in this breed to prrsv infection.

discussion
in this study, we used the prrsv orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences to assess the effects of geographical and temporal sampling on prrsv genetic diversity from  <dig> litters that where positive to prrsv. in addition, the effect of the glycosylation pattern of prrsv gp <dig> on infectivity of the virus, pigs adg and breed resistance/susceptibility to prrsv infection was studied.

no significant correlation between the genetic and spatial distances of the italian prrsv orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences was found. this suggests that, in farms and during the study period, prrsv was not easily transmitted between neighbouring farms. we did not observe any acute prrsv outbreak in the sampling period. if such outbreaks had occurred, relationships between genetics and geography may also have been positive and significant.

our results are in contrast with previous works  <cit>  but in concordance with the work reported by goldberg et al.  <cit>  and suggest that in northern italy, prrsv is most frequently spread among farms by the long distance, transportation of animals or semen. to confirm this latter hypothesis, we evaluated the possible effect of commercial semen source on prrsv transmission. at least for the artificial insemination centres considered in this study, no significant effect of commercial semen on prrsv transmission was found for neither orf <dig> nor orf <dig>  nevertheless, weigel et al.  <cit>  reported that artificial insemination increases significantly the risk that a farm is infected by prrsv.

we found that the genetic diversity of both orf <dig> and orf <dig> was highly correlated with time of sampling due to evolution of the local strains . our result is in contrast with the findings by goldberg et al.  <cit>  and mondaca-fernandez et al.  <cit> . this might be due to a period of observation of only one year by these authors or to the continuous introduction of new variants to the observed farms.

the characterization of genetic diversity of prrsv could be highly relevant to diagnostic testing  <cit> , accordingly we evaluated the genetic variability in orf <dig> and orf <dig>  all the obtained sequences were of genotype  <dig> and supported earlier findings on extraordinarily high diversity of italian prrsv compared to other countries in western europe  <cit> . therefore, using orf <dig> sequences, we reported an apd of  <dig>  for the strains considered in this study. a similar result  has been reported by  <cit>  albeit they used only  <dig> sequences.

modified live vaccine related strains are known to persist on vaccinated farms and to spread between farms  <cit> . in italy some vaccines  are registered and used but in the analysed farms these vaccines were never used to vaccine piglets. in contrast the sows were vaccinated on 50% of the farms considered in this study. however, few italian orf <dig> sequences clustered together with vaccine sequences , so a direct link between them and the transmission of vaccine related strains can be excluded.

the analysis of the glycosylation patterns in orf <dig> in italian strains revealed that most of them  carried three asparagines n-glycosylated at positions “n35/36/37”, “n46” and “n53”. it was suggested that the full glycosylated state is the most advantageous for virulence, easier spread and persistence in lymphoid tissue  <cit> . in this work we studied the effect of n <dig> glycosylation on the infectivity of the prrsv strains and on the pigs adg. the glycosylation of n <dig> has been shown to be fundamental to the formation of viral particles and prrsv ability to produce infectious progeny because gp <dig> could undergo improper folding  <cit> . statistical analysis showed that glycosylation pattern has an effect near significance  on adg <dig> but not adg <dig> . indeed, animals infected with prrsv n46+ had an adg <dig> 11% lower than that in pigs infected with prrsv n46-. this may suggest that the n46+ glycosylation pattern impairs pig immunity and consequently pig growth in the first weeks of life.

we used the pearson correlation to assess the correlation between the prrsv infectivity and the pig adg <dig> and adg <dig>  for this task, we divided the animals into two groups: 1) pigs infected with prrsv n46+ and 2) pigs infected with prrsv n46-. accordingly, we found that the correlations between pigs adg <dig> and the prrsv n46+/n46- infectivity were − <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in other words, in the litters infected with n46- strain, pig growth was not inhibited while in the case of litters infected with n46+ strains, pig growth was slowed. this finding may suggest that pigs infected with prrsv n46+ consume more energy to fight infection during 45–50 days after birth than the pigs infected with prrsv n46-.

associations between the breed and the glycosylation pattern would suggest a selective susceptibility/resistance of certain breeds to certain prrsv strains rather than a casual association between glycosylation pattern and breed. pietrain breed was infected preferentially by prrsv n46+ , however, this result is inconclusive due to the small number of pigs for pietrain breed. interestingly, the landrace breed showed low prrsv infection percentages compared with other breeds which may suggest specific resistance of this breed to prrs infection. ours results are in concordance with previous “in vitro” bstudies that evaluated the response of alveolar macrophages from five genetic lines of commercial pigs to prrsv infection  <cit> . according to the latest study, landrace breed showed a lower replication rate of the viral rna over 30 hours and a lower viral titre at 72 h post-infection than the other breeds . it has been suggested that genetic factors specific to the landrace breed could be responsible for the in vitro attenuation of prrsv replication in alveolar macrophages  <cit> .

vincent et al.  <cit>  reported a similar result and suggested that the slower viral accumulation and replication, resulting in reduced viral load, would enable the landrace breed to generate a more efficient adaptive immune response. in addition, we performed in field study in which the antibody response of  <dig> pigs from four breeds  to prrsv infection was measured. interestingly, we observed a higher antibody response to prrsv in the landrace and pietrain breeds . our results confirm previously reported findings stating that n-glycans surrounding the major neutralizing epitope located in the ectodomain of gp <dig> protect the virus from antibody neutralization and impair the immunogenicity of the epitope  <cit> . nevertheless, prrsv isolates lacking n-linked glycan at certain sites in gp <dig> grew in marc- <dig> cells and infected pigs  <cit> . similarly,  <cit>  showed that mutation of individual glycosylation sites at n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> in gp <dig> did not affect virus infectivity in cultured cells and pig. more studies are needed to shed light on n-linked glycans effects on prrsv pathogenicity.

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the association between prrsv genetic variability  and pig phenotypes such as prrsv infectivity by litter and adg.

using sequences of prrsv orf <dig> and orf <dig>  we showed that the clustering of prrsv strains was mainly determined by the farms from which the samples were collected. we found a significant positive association between the prrs genetic variability and the sampling time distance. the absence of geographical distance and semen effect on prrsv variability might indicate that transport via long-distance movement might be a stronger determinant of prrsv orf <dig> and orf <dig> diversity. the glycosylation had an effect on adg; in particular prrsv n46+ seems to interfere with pig adg. no association between the glycosylation pattern and the breed has been found except a suggestive significance  for the pietrain breed that has been found to be preferentially infected with prrsv n46+. the landrace breed had a lower infection rate than other breeds suggesting the higher resistance of this breed compared to the others 

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we revealed useful information concerning prrsv epidemiology and for the first time we assessed the association between prrsv genetic variability and some pig phenotypes. additional research targeting other prrsv genes and using temporal, spatial and evolutionary parameters are necessary to confirm these findings. association studies using a larger number of animals would confirm the reported results.
