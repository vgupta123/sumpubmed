BACKGROUND
pseudorabies virus , an alpha-herpesvirus, and the causative agent of aujeszky's diseases of swine  <cit> , is a commonly used model organism for studies in pathogenesis and the molecular biology of herpesviruses. furthermore, it is widely utilized as a neural circuit tracer  and has been reported to be suitable as a vector for gene delivery to various cells  <cit>  and as an oncolytic agent  <cit> . the gene expressions of herpesviruses are currently undergoing intensive investigation in consequence of the development of new technologies allowing simultaneous analysis of the expressions of multiple genes. dna microarray approaches have been applied for the overall analysis of herpesvirus gene expression in several studies . microchip techniques are powerful tools that permit simultaneous measurement of the relative changes in quantity of thousands of genes of an organism, and the comparison of gene expression profiles under various circumstances. quantitative real-time rt-pcr is a much more sensitive and accurate method, but, at least at present, it is not well suited for the analysis of large numbers of samples. the herpesvirus genome however is, within the range that can be successfully analysed with this technique  <cit> .

the program of herpesvirus gene expression is controlled at multiple levels by complex interactions between viral and cellular factors. the lytic gene expressions of herpesviruses are strictly coordinated in a sequential cascade manner and are traditionally subdivided into immediate-early , early  and late  phases. ie proteins are involved in the control of the synthesis of e and l genes. the ie <dig> gene  is the only ie gene of prv, and the most important regulator of viral gene expression. the e genes of herpesviruses are involved in various aspects of dna synthesis, while most l genes mainly encode the structural elements of the virus. the antisense transcripts llt  and lat  overlapping the icp <dig> and icp <dig> , respectively, are reported to play important roles in the establishment of latency in hsv  <cit> . it has not yet been unequivocally clarified whether the expression of antisense transcript produced by the complementary dna strand of the ie <dig> gene is controlled solely by the lap  producing llt or also by a putative promoter  localized on the inverted repeat of the prv genome, producing a shorter transcript. in this study, we use the term 'antisense transcript'  for the rna molecule transcribed from the complementary dna strand of the ie <dig> gene.

it is well known that both the host response and the success of a pathogen are dependent on the quantity of particles infecting an organism; and, specifically in herpesviruses, the infecting dose determines whether the virus enters a latent state or induces an acute infection  <cit> . a further important question is whether the global gene expression profile of the virus genome is dependent on the number of virus particles entering the cells. in both traditional and microarray studies, herpesvirus gene expression has been analysed by using a relatively high multiplicity of infection, typically moi~ <dig> plaque-forming unit /cell  <cit> . theoretically, it is possible that herpesviruses express their genomes in a different manner when only a single virus particle infects a cell as compared with the situation when multiple virions enter a cell. in the present study, we addressed this issue by using low  and high  mois for the infection of cultured porcine kidney epithelial cells with wild-type prv, and subsequently analysed and compared the expressions of  <dig> prv genes and two antisense transcripts  using the sybr green-based real-time rt-pcr technique.

RESULTS
experimental design
in this study, pk- <dig> cells were infected with pseudorabies virus at mois of  <dig>  and  <dig>  albeit the difference in the infectious dose in the two parallel experiments was 100-fold, an individual cell was invaded by only  <dig> times more virus particles in the high-moi than in the low-moi experiment , the reason for this being that in the latter case approximately 90% of the cells remained uninfected. cells were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection , as in our earlier report  <cit> . we used  <dig> h as the maximum infection period in order to exclude the possibility of the initiation of new infection cycles in the low-moi experiment. in this study, we analysed the expression of  <dig> genes  and two antisense transcripts  . for the calculation of relative expression ratios  , we used the average  <dig> h ect values of the high-moi experiments of both the "samples" and the "references" as controls, as in our earlier publication  <cit> . we used a correction factor of  <dig> for the calculation of r for the low-moi experiment . with this calculation technique, approximately the same numbers of infected cells, and hence the relative amounts of transcripts in an average infected cell, were compared in the two experiments. however, in the high-moi experiment, the proportion of the genome copy number in an infected cell was also 10-fold higher on average, at least before the start of viral dna replication , the reason for this being that in the high-moi experiment  <dig> virus particles infected an average cell, while in the low-moi infection  <dig> per cent of the cells were infected with a single virus particle. thus, to compare the gene expressions from a single virus dna per cell, two normalizations are necessary: multiplication of the r values of the low-moi data by  <dig>  and division of the r values of the high-moi data by  <dig>  in some calculations, the original data were handled accordingly . the relationship between the infectious dose and the genome copy number of prv becomes non-linear in later stages of viral infection; the dna copy numbers in the two experimental situations are therefore not comparable on the basis of the infectious dose. the r values of lat and ast were calculated by using the  <dig> h ect values of the corresponding genes, ep <dig> and ie <dig>  respectively, as the reference gene. rΔ values were used to monitor the net change in the quantity of viral transcripts within a given period of time . ra shows the ratio of the changes in the amounts of transcripts between two adjacent time points .

we considered two principles for the selection of genes for expression analyses.  we analysed the upstream genes of each nested gene cluster, the reason for this being that these genes are not overlapped by other genes, and the amounts of these transcripts are therefore proportional to their protein products. this is in contrast with the downstream genes, which, if transcribed from the promoter of an upstream gene, are not translated, because they do not have cap sequences that are required for the recognition by the ribosomes.  furthermore, we analysed genes that are of primary importance in the regulation of global viral gene expression, such as ie <dig>  ep <dig>  vhs and ul <dig> 

gene expressions in the early stage of prv infection
in the first  <dig> h of infection, the viral dna replication has not yet been initiated, and the copy number of viral genomes in a cell therefore corresponds with the infectious dose. in this analysis, we found that the mrna levels of most examined prv genes were higher in the cells infected with the high moi than in those infected with the low moi  at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h pi. this was not unexpected since in the former case viral dnas were represented in an approximately 10-fold higher proportion in an average infected cell. exceptions to this were the transcripts ul <dig>  ul <dig>  and ul <dig> mrnas at  <dig> h pi, and ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  and ul <dig> mrnas at  <dig> h pi, and at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h: ie <dig> and ul <dig> mrnas, as well as, lat and ast. however, the expression levels normalized to the genome copy number  showed an inverse pattern: only a few genes were expressed at higher abundance in the high-moi than in low-moi infection . ast was expressed at a considerably higher quantity in the cells infected with the low moi than in those infected with the high moi . the expression rate of a single genomic region encoding the ast was even  <dig> times higher  in the low-dose infection experiment . in the high-dose infection  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  exhibited higher expression levels at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h pi. it should be noted that  <dig> of them  are regulatory genes. the fourth regulatory prv gene, ep <dig>  is expressed at a very high level during the first  <dig> h in the high-moi infection . apart from ep <dig>  ul <dig>  was the only gene that was expressed at a higher extent in the early stages of infection than at  <dig> h pi in the high-moi experiment. the ie <dig> gene is the only one that was expressed in a higher amount at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h pi under both experimental conditions . overall, it appears that the  <dig> regulatory genes were expressed at relatively high levels before the onset of dna replication in the high-moi infection, which was not the case in low-moi infection, with the exception of the ie <dig> gene. we think that the reason for the higher expression of regulatory genes at the onset of viral dna replication in the high-moi infection is that more regulatory proteins are needed to carry out the multiplication of a higher copy number of the viral genome. the rate of change in gene expression within the  <dig> h to  <dig> h interval  was higher in more than two-thirds of the prv genes  in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection . the proportion of ast to ie <dig> mrna molecules  was  <dig>  at  <dig> h pi, and  <dig>  at  <dig> h pi in cells infected with the low moi, while this ratio was extremely low  at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h pi in the high-moi infection . thus, the proportion of ast to ie <dig> mrna  was 39-fold higher at  <dig> h pi and 293-fold higher at  <dig> h pi in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection. in the early stages of prv infection, the amount of ast was very high; it even significantly exceeded the level of ie <dig> mrnas at  <dig> h pi in the low-moi infection, while the amount of ast and also its ratio to ie <dig> mrna were extremely low in the high-moi infection. moreover, ie <dig> mrna is expressed to a significantly higher extent in the low-moi experiment despite the  <dig> times lower copy number of prv dna in an infected cell, which is especially important because ie <dig> is a dna-binding protein. we think that this observation reveals an important regulatory mechanism of the herpesviruses, which is as follows: in a high-titre infection, the virus initiates a lytic infection in a cell, while in a low-titre infection, the virus has the choice of whether to establish a dormant state or enter a lytic cycle in a cell. the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon might be based on the interaction of ie <dig> and ast genes at both the transcription and translation levels.  the ie <dig> protein might exert a negative effect on the synthesis of ast, such as in lat in hsv  <cit>  by binding the promoter of the antisense transcript.  furthermore, the complementary transcripts might mutually influence each other's expression transcript by rna-rna interaction. in a low-moi infection, the two transcripts exhibit a complementary expression pattern, which indicates a competition between the two transcripts. in a high-moi infection, however, the high initial amount of ie <dig> gene product inhibits the expression of ast. the significance of this infection strategy could be that, in the case of a low-amount infection, the virus has no chance to invade the host cells; therefore, it is better to hide against the immune surveillance.

the ep <dig> gene is expressed in higher quantity at both  <dig> h pi  and  <dig> h pi  in the high-moi infection than in low-moi infection, which is in contrast with lat, its antisense partner, whose expression level was lower in the high-moi infection . thus, the ratios of lat to ep <dig> mrna molecules were  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h pi and  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h pi in the low-moi than in the high-moi experiment, although, unlike ast, lat is abundantly expressed in the high-moi infection. accordingly, similarly to ast, lat is expressed in a significantly higher proportion to ep <dig> mrna in the low-moi infection in the early stages of infection, which may also be important as concerns of the replication strategy of the virus. our analyses additionally showed that ast and lat are, at least partly, expressed independently from each other, which supports the existence of separate elements controlling the expressions of the two antisense transcripts. indeed, ast was suggested to be controlled by an antisense promoter  localized in the outer regions of inverted repeats  <cit> .

gene expressions in later stages of prv infection
at  <dig> h pi the transcript levels of more than three-quarters of the prv genes  were still higher in the cells infected with the high moi than in those infected with the low moi . however, in about two-third of the viral genes the rate of change  in the expression level was higher in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection  . in the low-moi infection, the amounts of  <dig> transcripts  were less than 10% of those in the high-moi infection at  <dig> h pi. all of the examined us genes are expressed at a significantly lower level in the low-than in the high-titre infection at  <dig> h pi. there were significant decreases in the quantities of both ast and lat in the low-titre infection at  <dig> h pi relative to the  <dig> h values . we explain this phenomenon by the negative effect of the regulatory genes on their antisense partners. regulatory genes are upregulated at the onset of dna replication , which exerts an inhibitory effect on the expression of ast and lat. in contrast, there were increases in the amounts of antisense transcripts in the high-moi  in this time interval. however, while lat was expressed at high level  under the high-moi conditions, the ast expression remained extremely low  in this period of infection. the amount of the ie <dig> transcript was practically unchanged within the  <dig> h to  <dig> h infection period under either infection conditions. there was a  <dig> -fold increase in the ep <dig> mrna level within the  <dig> h to  <dig> h infection period  in the low-moi infection, as compared with only  <dig>  in the high-moi experiment. on average, the amounts of mrnas in low titre infection became higher than those in the high-infection titre by  <dig> h pi in more than half of the prv genes . we assume that the reason for this might be that the ie <dig> gene, the major coordinator of gene expression, is expressed at higher levels at  <dig> and  <dig> h pi at low-moi than at high-moi infection. moreover, in the high-moi infection the amount of ast reached almost 30% of the transcript level in the low-moi infection, while lat was expressed at approximately the same level under the two infection conditions at  <dig> h pi. the genes expressed at lower levels in the low-dose infection appeared to be clustered on adjacent genomic locations . each gene and the two antisense transcripts were expressed at higher rates  within the  <dig> h to  <dig> h period in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection without exception . in the high-moi infection,  <dig> genes and lat peaked at  <dig> h within the 6-h examination period, while in the low-moi infection only the us <dig> transcript had a slightly lower r value at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h pi. the us <dig> gene was the only one among the  <dig> prv genes which was expressed at a higher level at  <dig> h than at  <dig> h pi in another study  <cit> . intriguingly, the ep <dig> mrnas reached a  <dig> -fold higher level in the low-dose than in the high-dose infection in an average cell at  <dig> h pi. furthermore, at  <dig> h pi the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes were expressed at an approximately  <dig> times higher level under the low-moi than under the high-moi conditions.

gene expression kinetics within the  <dig> to 6-h infection period
the expression of most prv genes basically differed under the two infection conditions , which is in contrast with the case of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus , whose lytic gene expression commences at a fixed pace in infected cells, regardless of the moi  <cit> . most genes were expressed at a lower level in a cell in the low-moi experiment in the first  <dig> h of infection, but more than half of these gene products surpassed the high-moi values by  <dig> h pi. the r values of  <dig> prv genes  were higher in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection at every examined time point, while the opposite was true  in  <dig> genes: ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig> , ul <dig>  us <dig>  us <dig>  us <dig> and us <dig> . these latter genes form clusters on the basis of their localization on the genome , which suggests that the adjacent genomic sequences might be under common regulatory control. this observation is supported by the similarity of the ra curves of adjacent genes . for example, the expression rates of the ul <dig>  ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes were similar to each other in both experiments, but each of them exhibited an inverse expression pattern in the two infection conditions. all genes were expressed at a higher rate  within the  <dig> h to  <dig> h period of infection in the low-titre experiment, except for ie <dig> and the two antisense transcripts. the quantities of ie <dig> mrnas were similar in the two experiments, except at  <dig> h pi, where the level of the transcripts was  <dig> -fold higher in the low-moi infection. thus, the amount of total ie <dig> transcript in an infected cell appears to be under strict control, independently of the initial infection conditions. in contrast, the expression of the ep <dig> gene differed basically in the two experiments. in the high-moi experiment, the amount of ep <dig> mrnas was high from the first hour of infection, and its expression even declined by  <dig> h in the high-moi infection, while the amount of these transcripts rapidly increased throughout the 6-h infection period in the low-dose infection, and reached a  <dig> -fold higher level compared to that of the high-dose infection by  <dig> h.  the ratio of sense and antisense transcripts during the 6-h infection period displayed intriguing patterns. first of all, in the high-moi infection the amount of ast and its ratio to ie <dig> mrna were very low throughout the 6-h infection period. we demonstrated an inverse relationship in the expression kinetics of ie <dig> mrna and ast and also ep <dig> mrna and lat in the low-moi infection; however, we did not observe this inverse relationship between the complementary transcripts under the high-moi conditions . in an earlier report  <cit> , we showed that treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide  resulted in significant increases in the amounts of both ie <dig> mrna and ast, while phosphonoacetic acid  treatment led to a decrease in ie <dig> mrna and a significant increase in the ast level. these results suggest a negative effect of the ie <dig> transactivator on asp synthesis. we explain the huge drop in asp level in the infected cells in the early stage of the high-moi infection by the presence of a 10-fold higher amount of inhibitory ie <dig> protein localized in the tegument of the infecting virions  <cit> . the same reason could account for the lower ie <dig> mrna level in the high-moi infection. the us <dig> gene was expressed in the late kinetics in our earlier low-moi analysis in both phophonoacetic acid-treated and non-treated samples. these results are in concordance with those of the present high-dose infection experiment, i.e. us <dig> mrna was expressed at a relatively low level at  <dig> h, which even dropped by  <dig> h pi. the highest rate of us <dig> mrna expression was observed at  <dig> h, with a rate  typical of l genes. the pearson correlation coefficients of the r, rΔ, and ra values precisely show the degree of similarity  of the expression kinetics of the genes in the low- and high-moi experiments . several genes exhibited high correlations for all three parameters. for example, the ie <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes gave high correlation coefficients for the r, rΔ and ra values. the us <dig> gene behaved in an irregular manner; it gave a relatively high correlation for the r values, no correlation of rΔ, and an inverse correlation for the ra values. ast yielded relatively high negative values for all three parameters, indicating a significant negative correlation. the expressions of lat under the two experimental conditions did not correlate on the basis of the r values, whereas it gave a very high negative correlation for its rΔ and ra values. the effect of the moi on the overall gene expression of hsv- <dig> has been investigated by wagner and colleagues  <cit> , who found that, following the infection of cultured cells by wild-type virus at mois ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> pfu/cell, the temporal profiles of transcript abundance were essentially the same. this is in sharp contrast with our results. we explain the differences by the low resolution of the microarray technique that wagner et al. used for their analysis. an analysis of the global transcription of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus, a γ-herpesvirus, has revealed differential gene expression at different mois  <cit> , but these data cannot be compared because they related to later time points  than in our analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis has revealed that almost all of the examined prv genes exhibited different expression dynamics under the two experimental conditions. most prv genes were expressed at a lower level in the low-moi than in the high-moi experiment in the early stages of infection; however, the reverse was true when the transcript levels were normalized to the genome copy numbers. in the low-moi infection, slightly more than half of the prv transcripts outran the high-moi values by  <dig> h pi. the lower ie <dig> transcript per genome in the high-titre infection experiment might account for the lower level of global prv gene expression per genome in the high-moi infection. however, the expression of viral genes per dna did not uniformly decrease; some genes even became more active in the high-moi infection, which indicates the selective effect of the reduced availability of the ie <dig> protein. the most dramatic difference between the two moi infections was observed in ast, which was expressed at a more than two log higher level in an infected cell in the low-moi infection, which is a  <dig> log higher activity of a single dna region encoding the asp. the ratio of lat/ep <dig> was also significantly lower in the high-than in the low-moi infection. the reasons for and the mechanisms of these phenomena remain to be clarified. furthermore, genes localized in adjacent regions on the viral genome exhibited similar expression properties, indicating the existence of synchronizing mechanisms of gene expression.
