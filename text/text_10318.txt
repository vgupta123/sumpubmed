BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are mobile repetitive dna that have been found in virtually all eukaryotic genomes investigated so far  <cit> . ltr retrotransposons are class i tes that transpose in a "copy and paste" mode via rna intermediates. typical structural characters of a ltr retrotransposon include: 1) two highly similar ltr sequences from several hundred to several thousand bp; 2) 4– <dig> bp target site duplication  at its 5' and 3' ends; 3) primer binding site  downstream of 5' ltr and polypurine tract  upstream of 3' ltr; 4) protein-coding domains of enzymes important to retrotransposition, e.g. capsid protein , aspartic proteinase , reverse transcriptase , integrase , and rnase h . sometimes envelope protein  may occur as well  <cit> . in the plant kingdom, ltr elements present a significant fraction of many genomes and even make predominant components of large genomes  <cit> . the amplification and deletion of these elements is considered to be an important mechanism underlying the remarkable genome size variation in plants  <cit> . moreover, ltr retrotransposons affect genome organization, gene regulation  <cit> , novel gene origination  <cit>  and other genetic functions. in summary, the dynamics of ltr retrotransposons are thought to be an important source of genome evolution.

medicago truncatula is a model plant of the fabaceae, the third largest angiosperm family. because of their vital role in agriculture and environment  <cit> , legumes have provoked great interests. the identification and study of ltr elements is one of the basic and indispensable step to understand biology and evolution of this family. the sequencing of mt opens an unprecedented opportunity to carry out a thorough study of it at the molecular level. genomic data so far released have made it possible to explore many important facts of the mt genome, specifically, the characteristics of ltr elements and their interactions with the host organism.

in comparison with the gramineae, the knowledge of ltr retrotransposons in the fabaceae is relatively limited  <cit> . to date, a few mt ltr families, e.g. megy and ogre have been well documented  <cit>  and some families have been deposited in repbase  <cit>  and tigr plant repeat databases  <cit> . however, little research has been focused on the comprehensive identification and description of ltr retrotransposons based on high-throughput mt genomic sequences.

here we report the result of the computer-based analysis of ltr retrotransposons in  <dig> mb mt bac sequences. at least  <dig> ltr families were found. we analyzed their phylogenetic relationship and structural patterns, with emphasis on several important families. we investigated the amplification-deletion pattern of these ltr elements and found that the removal of ltr elements in mt has been more rapid than in rice, and more than  <dig> mb of ltr retrotransposon sequences have been lost. the present work in about 41% of the whole-genome provides the ltr retrotransposon landscape in medicago truncatula.

RESULTS
estimation of copy-number of ltr elements
the development of ab initio algorithms  <cit>  has greatly promoted the identification and analysis of ltr elements in large-scale genomic data. with predicted full-length elements at hand, a widely adopted method to find their related copies is to perform homology search against the host genome. however, subregions of full-length elements may be generated through insertion of other tes, e.g. nested elements are caused by the insertion of ltr elements one into another  <cit> . in this report, we call these subregions unrelated sequences. based only on the recognition of structural characters, ab initio prediction is not capable to provide information on such sequences. if an element contains unrelated sequences derived from highly abundant tes, taking the direct matches as its copies will greatly overestimate its copy-number and exaggerate its contribution to the host genome. therefore, we developed an algorithm  to discriminate unrelated sequences and discard the matches generated by them . using this method we obtained a more accurate estimation of the number of mt ltr copies.

overview of ltr retrotransposons
this survey identified  <dig> full-length ltr elements in  <dig> kb mt bac sequences . the following validation process detected more than  <dig> copies, corresponding to  <dig> kb sequences, about  <dig> % of all the sequences scanned. if this value is kept in the unreleased genomic sequences, the percentage of the ltr retrotransposons in mt is lower than that in rice   <cit> , yet still remarkably higher than that in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> . the length of the full-length elements is within the ranges of  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kb and that of the ltrs is  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kb . most of the elements showed canonical tg-ca boxes and 4– <dig> bp tsds.

in this report, we define the ltr family by dna sequence similarity, following the suggestion of wicker et al.  <cit> : two elements belong to the same family if they share 80%  sequence identity in at least 80% of their coding region or internal domain, or within their ltr, or in both. a novel family is discovered when the following standards are met: 1) none of the members in the family belong to the same family with known legume ltr retrotransposons. 2) besides a full-length member, the family has at least one strong hit .

the  <dig> full-length elements and their related copies thus were classified into  <dig> families, of which  <dig> were identified for the first time. the information of these families is listed in table  <dig>  ltr families are denoted as mtrxx  and the last two columns of table  <dig> list the number of full-length and strong-hit copies because these two values provide multi-copy supports for a family. the following sections sometimes mention the total copy-number of a family and the length of its sequences. such values, however, are estimated by all copies of that family, including full-length, strong-hit and other truncated ones.

phylogenetic analysis classified  <dig> families as copia or gypsy superfamily  and the rest  <dig>  though quite abundant in genome, could not be categorized as either superfamily by their protein-coding domain organization or sequence similarity. we found that half of the  <dig> families had long orfs in their internal domain and some orfs showed a certain degree of homology with known te proteins. these families were categorized into trims or lards group  by their length  <cit> .

protein domain organization and phylogenetic relationships within ltr families
we analyzed protein-domain organization of the  <dig> families  and found  <dig> patterns . hmmer detected the canonical copia and gypsy domain structures, i.e. 5'-gag-in-rt-3' and 5'-gag-rt-in-3', in  <dig> and  <dig> families, respectively. although it failed to detect the gag proteins in  <dig> families, they could still be categorized by the order of their rt and in in the pol. mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> had rt but not in, and they were assigned to either superfamilies by sequence similarity of rt domain : mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were categorized as copia superfamily while mtr <dig> as gypsy superfamily. at last, we obtained  <dig> copia-like and  <dig> gypsy-like families. using a rt of bel-pao element  as outgroup, we constructed the nj phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> families based on their rt similarity . the tree branched into two clades and this split was well supported . in the tree, the superfamily label of each external node was given according to the order of domains. it is worth noting that the two clades consist of neither more nor less than members of two superfamilies, respectively. in other words, the categorization of superfamily based on rt similarity concurs with that based on domain organization. this means that rt similarity is enough to categorize ltr elements at the level of superfamily. in figure  <dig>  mtr <dig>  mtr <dig>  and mtr <dig> are also drawn with others, but the tree topology do not change if they are deleted. these results support their earlier categorization by rt similarity.

a this table only shows the organization of gag, in and rt. see s <dig>  for more information.

b these elements are classified by rt similarity.

c orfs inside the three families share week similarity with some putative gag proteins in uniprot.

d this rt is from mtr <dig> but can not be assigned to either superfamily.

to reveal the phylogenetic relationships within the superfamilies, we collected from literatures rt domains of  <dig> reference elements representing known eukaryotic ltr lineages  <cit>  and combined these data with our  <dig> families to construct trees . we found that the copia-like families belonged to  <dig> clades. mtc- <dig>  a new lineage composed of mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> and mtr <dig>  was recognized with middle support . the gypsy-like families belonged to  <dig> well defined lineages .

pbs pattern of ltr elements
we investigated tsd, ppt and pbs patterns of ltr elements. although the tsds and ppts did not show significant sequence preference, we found clear trna usage bias through the pbs strings. the validation of a pbs sequence was to find the string which was located immediately downstream of the 5' ltr and a reverse complement to the 3' ends of a trna  <cit> . by the criterion of matching at least  <dig> bp, the pbss were detected in  <dig> families, including all members in copia and gypsy superfamilies and  <dig> other families. we found that trnas corresponding to his, phe, tyr, ser and cys were never used as primer of reverse transcription and the majority of the rest  <dig> actually detected trna types occurred with low frequency. by contrast, the most-detected  <dig> types were used by nearly 3/ <dig> families. moreover, trnamet occurred in about 60% of the  <dig> families and was the most frequently used type in both superfamilies and trims-lards. trnaarg was the second important primer in gypsy superfamily and was only used by this group .

copia superfamily
the present research discovered  <dig> novel families, including  <dig> copia-like,  <dig> gypsy-like and  <dig> other ones. we describe each group in the following three sections, with emphasis on some important families.

the total copy-number of the  <dig> copia-like families reached  <dig> and their sequences had a total length of  <dig> kb, about 3% of all genomic sequences investigated. full-length elements varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb, with an average of  <dig>  kb. the longest family mtr2/copia <dig>  which had more than  <dig> copies, was one of the most abundant copia-like families. we detected  <dig> long orfs in its internal domain. from 5' to 3', the first two orfs encoded canonical gag-pol proteins. the third orf, located less than  <dig> kb downstream of the pol region, encoded a protein longer than 790aa. although the homology search against uniprot  <cit>  did not return significant match to this orf, it showed quite high conservation among the family members . moreover, we found that a  <dig> bp subregion in this orf matched the putative env protein of the glycine max putative endogenous retrovirus sire1- <dig> with low significance . these results indicated that this orf probably encoded a protein related to putative plant env.

besides mtr <dig>  there were  <dig> copia-like families longer than  <dig> kb and all of them had the gag, in and rt domains. mtr <dig> was the most abundant copia-like family and the second largest in all the  <dig> families. it had  <dig> full-length members, more than  <dig> copies and its sequences reached more than  <dig>  mb in length, about 36% of the total length of the copia-like copies. the percentage was  <dig>  times as high as that of the second largest copia-like family mtr <dig>  whose sequences were  <dig> kb in length. the pbs of mtr <dig> bounded trnamet and the length of its full-length members and ltrs were about  <dig> and  <dig>  kb, respectively. outside mt, the best match of its rt domain in uniprot was from v. vinifera . similar to mtr <dig>  a third long orf was also detected in its internal domain . however, this orf, matching a putative uncharacterized mt protein , was less conservative among the family members. the length of the ltrs of copia-like families fell within the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb, with an average of  <dig> bp. ltrs could be roughly categorized into  <dig> zones: 100– <dig> bp, 600– <dig> bp,  <dig> – <dig>  kb and > <dig>  kb. the number of families in these zones was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . we found that long elements tended to have long ltrs. in fact, almost all ltrs longer than  <dig> kb were from elements longer than  <dig> kb. mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were exceptions. the length of the ltr of mtr <dig> reached  <dig>  kb yet that of the full length was only  <dig> kb. as one of the most abundant copia-like retrotransposon, mtr <dig> had  <dig> kb sequences in the genome, it was a typical non-autonomous family since no > <dig> bp orf could be detected in its internal domain and its rt degenerated to a fragment of 40aa.

there were  <dig> copia-like families whose ltrs and full-length sequences were shorter than  <dig> bp and  <dig> kb, respectively.  <dig> of them have been deposited in repbase. mtr30/mtcopia <dig> and mtr32/cop <dig> were quite active in the genome and their copies corresponded to more than  <dig> and  <dig> kb sequences, respectively. despite short ltrs, we detected 5'-in-rt-3' domains in all of them and gag proteins in  <dig> 

gypsy superfamily
the  <dig> gypsy-like families corresponded to  <dig> kb sequences and constituted 5% of all genomic data. this group had a full length of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, with an average of  <dig>  kb. their ltrs were from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb in length, with an average of  <dig>  kb. compared with copia-like ltr retrotransposons, gypsy-like elements were longer in general: the great majority of gypsy-like families had a full length >  <dig> kb and ltr > <dig> bp, while the full length and the ltr of most copia-like families were <  <dig> kb and 500bp, respectively . the total copy-number in this superfamily was  <dig>  about  <dig>  times more than copia superfamily . despite fewer members, gypsy superfamily contributed more to the mt genome than copia superfamily because of longer length and more active amplification in the past.

mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were ogre families  <cit>  and mtr57/ogre <dig> was the largest in all the  <dig> families. our survey detected its  <dig> full-length members and more than  <dig> copies in total. the length of its sequences reached  <dig>  mb. mtr <dig> was closely related to mtr <dig> in the phylogenetic tree, and was the second longest in all the families . these two families used trnaarg as primer and their internal domain encoded 5'-gag-rt-rh-in-3' proteins. we detected an orf of  <dig> bp located upstream of the gag and an intron in the pol. such phylogenetic and structural features well support that mtr <dig> is a novel ogre family. mtr <dig> was the second largest family in the gypsy group and the third largest in all the families. it had more than  <dig> copies in total and corresponded to  <dig>  mb sequences, about 1/ <dig> of mtr57/ogre <dig>  its full length were about  <dig>  kb and the ltrs were  <dig>  kb in length. its internal domain encoded 5'-gag-pro-rt-rh-in-3' proteins  and its pbs matched trnamet well. phylogenetically, this family belonged to the tekay clade.

mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were the other  <dig> families longer than > <dig> kb. similar to copia superfamily, it was found that, when the full-length of an element was > <dig> kb, the ltr was correspondingly > <dig> kb. the only exceptional family mtr <dig> had a ltr of  <dig> bp. besides normal 5'-gag-rt-rh-in-3' domains, this family had  <dig> additional > <dig> bp orfs downstream of the pol. they were all located in the complementary chain and had no match in uniport. however, these orfs were quite conservative among the family members . we estimated that these orfs were derived from other sources and later captured by mtr <dig>  the short ltr reflected short original length of this family. mtr <dig> belonged to the athila clade . its pbs bound trnaasp and its protein-coding domains organized as 5'-gag-rt-in-3'. downstream of the pol, there were two > <dig> bp orfs encoding uncharacterized proteins . mtr <dig>  the sister branch of mtr <dig>  also had an extra orf downstream of the pol. its best match in uniprot was from garden asparagus  and it shared weak similarity with the first extra orf in mtr <dig> . known elements of the athila clade were putative plant endogenous retroviruses, thus the possibility that the extra orfs in mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> encoded the putative envs was strong, although they did not share significant similarity with the putative envs of known athila elements.

mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were from the crm clade, while mtr72/gypshan and mtr <dig> were from renia. families of these two clades were relatively inactive in mt: each had a copy-number < <dig> and corresponded to < <dig> kb sequences. even so, they all showed multiple domains in their internal domain .

trims and lards
because their internal domain lacked strong homology to any known te proteins, the  <dig> families were required to have at least  <dig> strong hits in the genome. the total sequences of them were  <dig> kb in length, about  <dig> % of all data. according to the suggestion of  <cit> , the  <dig> families that had a length less than  <dig> kb were classified as trims and the other  <dig> as lards.

we detected orfs longer than  <dig> bp in  <dig> families: mtr <dig> had  <dig> such orfs. one shared weak similarity with a gag protein in rice  and the other with a putative transposon protein in a. thaliana . although hmmer failed to detect  rt and in domains in  <dig> of the  <dig> full-length members, previous analyses suggested that mtr80/megy belonged to a distinct clade called env-class  <cit> . mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> each had only one orf > <dig> bp. the best uniprot match of the orf in mtr <dig> was again q9xh <dig> , while that of the orf in mtr <dig> was an uncharacterized protein from grape . the orf in mtr <dig> was highly similar to that in mtr <dig>  and a subregion in this orf was reported as a gag by hmmer .

mtr <dig> is the longest family in the  <dig>  although its internal domain was long, most members in this family rarely contained long orfs. searching the internal domain against uniprot with blastx retrieved a  <dig> bp region homologous to some rt proteins and the best well-studied match was from the maize  opie element . the high similarity with opie strongly supported that this orf did encode a rt domain. however, it could not be detected by hmmer and this indicated that this rt might be not built in current rt profiles. phylogenetic analysis further revealed that it belonged to neither copia nor gypsy superfamily but was close to the outgroup . further investigation is needed to fully resolve its position.

the last family that shared homology with known te proteins was mtr <dig>  it had a ~ <dig> bp orf encoding a fragment of rh . each of the other  <dig> families had more than  <dig> strong hits and quite large copy-number in the genome. mtr <dig> was the shortest family, of which the full-length members and the ltrs were only  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. instead of typical 5'-tg-3', 5' ends of its ltrs were 5'-ta-3'. despite highly degenerated internal domain, this family had  <dig> full-length members and  <dig> strong hits. mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> and mtr <dig> were lards. similar to mtr <dig>  mtr <dig> was an abundant non-autonomous family with highly degenerated internal domain .

structure of ltr retrotransposons in mt
we studied the structure of the ltr families and figure  <dig> displays the structures of  <dig> highly abundant ones, five of which have been described above. the structure of ogre elements is not shown because it has been reported previously  <cit> . here we just point out that the ltr regions of most families tend to be less conservative among the family members in comparison with te proteins, as well as many long orfs. this result well supports that ltrs are the most rapidly evolving regions in ltr retrotransposons  <cit> .

insertion-deletion of ltr retrotransposons in mt
mtr <dig>  mtr <dig>  mtr <dig>  mtr <dig>  mtr57- <dig> and mtr <dig> each had more than  <dig> full-length members. the total number of these full-length copies was  <dig>  making up  <dig> % of all the full-length elements identified. their total copies constituted  <dig> % of the ltr retrotransposon sequences.

paleontology analysis on the  <dig> elements revealed that they were quite young: all were inserted within the last  <dig> my and 90% within  <dig>  my. compared with others, the active period of mtr <dig>  and mtr <dig>  was relatively long . recent researches have argued that truncated ltr elements were mainly caused by unequal homologous or illegitimate recombination within genome and the result of recombination was the deletion of genomic sequences  <cit> . we estimated the deletion of ltr copies in mt genome from two aspects: 1) the deletion of full-length structure and 2) the number of dna loss. the deletion of a full-length structure means that mutation and recombination remove so many structural characters of a full-length element that it can not be recognized any more. assuming that repetitive sequences are removed at a constant rate, the survival time of full-length structure obeys an exponential distribution and therefore the half-life is an index to estimate the speed of removal. with this method,  <cit>  estimated that the half-life of the full-length elements in rice was about  <dig>  my.

we calculated the insertion date of all the  <dig> full-length elements and found that 90% of them inserted within the last  <dig>  my . fitting of the distribution to the exponential function obtained α = - <dig> , which corresponded to a half-life τ =  <dig>  my . the bootstrap revealed that the half-life varied between  <dig>  to  <dig>  my. to compare the speed of removal in legume and grass, we calculated the half-life for  <dig> full-length elements in the two sequenced rice genomes . elements in rice and mt were predicted under the same parameters . as can be seen from figure 3c and 3d, our data supported that the half-life of full-length structure in rice was ~ <dig>  my, a lesser value than the estimation of  <cit>  but still greater than that in mt. furthermore, statistical testing revealed that the insertion dates in the two species were from different distributions . if the mean substitution rates of ltr elements in mt and grass are approximately the same  <cit> , the above results support that the full-length structures have been deleted more rapid in mt than in rice. if the deletions have been occurred randomly in genome, the results further indicate that the removal of ltr elements in mt has been more rapid than in rice.

the total number of the strong hits was only 6% of all detected copies, but their size reached 42%. this indicated that ltr elements in mt were highly fragmented and these truncated copies, great in number, might be generated by the removal of genomic dna. if the truncated ltr copies were real vestiges of paralogous copies of families and if they had similar lengthes to the representative copies at the time of insertion, the difference of the length of truncated and representative copies provided the amount of deleted dna since their insertion  <cit> . the estimation of the upper and lower limits of dna loss could be as follows: we used the copies of rset  to estimate the lower limit. the data revealed that  <dig>  mb sequences have been deleted. since rset only consisted of not-so-severely truncated copies, it caused an underestimate of dna loss. in contrast, we used all the truncated copies to estimate the upper limit and this gave more than  <dig> mb of dna has been removed. since only 40% of the genome was analyzed here, we estimated that more than  <dig> mb of ltr retrotransposon sequences have been deleted from the mt genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we have systematically identified and described ltr retrotransposons in nearly half of the medicago truncatula genome, investigated their classification, structure, evolutionary dynamics and impact on the evolution of the host genome. the present work has provided a ltr retrotransposon landscape for this model legume. the sequencing of other species such as lotus japonicus and glycine max will provide great opportunity to study comparatively the evolutionary dynamics of ltr families in two or more legume organisms and further explore the interactions between these elements and their host genomes.
