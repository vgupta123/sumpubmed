BACKGROUND
a novel influenza a virus  of swine origin emerged in mexico and the united states in march and early april  <dig>  the virus quickly spread worldwide through human-to-human transmission resulting in the world health organization raising the influenza pandemic alert to the highest level  on june  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . the outbreak and spread of the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century challenged licensed vaccine manufacturers to rapidly mobilize and generate a prophylactic vaccine. delivery of initial doses of vaccine to the u.s. public coincided with the second peak of the pandemic, too late to provide timely protection and highlighting the need for alternative production platforms  <cit> .

two types of licensed influenza vaccines are available in the u.s.: trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine  <cit> , both produced in embryonated chicken eggs. the process of preparing a new vaccine seed strain suitable for growth in eggs can be quite lengthy, as it involves re-assortment between the genes of a high yielding donor virus, such as a/puerto rico/8/ <dig>  and the hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  genes of the new influenza strain  <cit> . the candidate seed virus strains are then further selected for high growth capability in eggs before they can be used for the production of vaccines. this manufacturing process is not only lengthy but also limited in scalability due to its dependence on the availability of embryonated chicken eggs.

the production of purified recombinant hemagglutinin  subunit vaccines via the baculovirus expression vector system  is a leading alternative platform for influenza vaccine manufacture. the most advanced influenza vaccine candidate produced using this technology  is a trivalent composition of three rha proteins corresponding to the full length ha proteins of the seasonally circulating influenza strains  <cit> . clinical trials of flublok have demonstrated that the vaccine is well-tolerated, immunogenic , and provides protection against drifted influenza viruses  <cit> . the rha proteins in flublok are produced using genetically modified baculoviruses in lepidopteran insect cells. the proteins are extracted and purified from cell pellet using a combination of filtration and column chromatography methods. bulk vaccine can be produced within seven weeks of receipt of the ha gene sequence  <cit> , making it an attractive platform for pandemic vaccine manufacturing as demonstrated during the initial outbreaks of h5n <dig>  <cit> .

the original influenza seed viruses used for the egg-based production of the apdm <dig> vaccine grew slowly, produced relatively low quantities of ha antigen and showed poor stability  <cit> . the rha derived from a/california/07/ <dig> also revealed differences compared to other rha proteins, as the pandemic rha protein was more sensitive to proteolytic degradation and reacted uniquely in the single radial immunodiffusion  potency assay.

the objectives of this study were  to study the properties of the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein and compare it to other rha proteins derived from seasonal influenza strains and  to develop an understanding of the cause of the instability observed with this antigen.

RESULTS
biochemical and biophysical characterization
the electrophoretic mobility of purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein was compared to purified rha derived from a/new caledonia/20/ <dig>  a/solomon islands/03/ <dig>  and a/brisbane/59/ <dig> h1n <dig> seasonal influenza strains using reducing and non-reducing sds-page . purified rha proteins typically migrate as monomers and disulfide-linked oligomers under non-reducing conditions. the primary full-length ha <dig> band migrates at approximately 62 kda, and dimer and trimer bands are approximately  <dig> and 180 kda, respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>  the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein displayed electrophoretic mobility comparable to that of the seasonal rha h <dig> proteins. the lack of protein bands with molecular weight higher than that of ha <dig> under reducing conditions indicates that the oligomeric forms observed under non-reducing conditions were disulfide-linked. the a/california/07/ <dig> ha <dig> band migrated slightly faster than the ha <dig> comparators, possibly because a/california/07/ <dig> ha protein has only a single glycosylation site in the globular head  in contrast to the nine sites identified in the ha from a/brisbane/59/ <dig> h1n <dig> virus  <cit> . in addition, less cleavage of a/california/07/ <dig> ha <dig> into ha <dig> and ha <dig> was observed.

a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein eluted as a single peak prior to a thyroglobulin molecular weight standard  similar to other rha proteins when analyzed by hplc-sec , demonstrating that rha proteins form high molecular weight complexes. no peaks indicative of rha monomers, dimers, or trimers were detected. the retention time of a/california/07/ <dig> rha was longer  than that of b/brisbane/60/ <dig> rha  or a/perth/16/ <dig> rha . this result indicates that a/california/07/ <dig> rha forms a slightly smaller complex than a/perth/16/ <dig> or b/brisbane/60/ <dig> rha.

dynamic light scattering  data showed that for all rhas evaluated, the measured size corresponded to multimeric protein particles, with the majority falling between  <dig> and 40 nm in diameter . a greater percentage of the rha proteins from a/california/07/ <dig> and b/brisbane/60/ <dig> had particle diameters below 20 nm compared to a/brisbane/59/ <dig> and a/perth/16/ <dig> rha. despite these minor differences, the dls results demonstrate that the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein forms particles with size distribution comparable to that of other seasonal rha proteins.

electron microscopy images of the purified a/california/07/ <dig> , a/brisbane/59/ <dig> , a/perth/16/ <dig>  and b/brisbane/60/ <dig> rha proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  a/california/07/ <dig> rha formed multimeric rosette-like structures consistent with the other purified rha proteins but were less distinct compared to the h <dig> rha protein, which formed clearer rosette-like structures than either the h <dig> or b rha proteins. all of the rha rosette-like structures measured approximately  <dig> – 40 nm in size, consistent with the measurements determined by hplc-sec and dls.

purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein showed increased sensitivity to trypsin compared to other rha proteins. typically, ha <dig> is cleaved into ha <dig> and ha <dig> subunits when treated with trypsin, and we found that a/california/07/ <dig> rha was digested into ha <dig> and ha <dig> peptides in a similar manner . however, we also found that a/california/07/ <dig> ha <dig> was additionally digested into two prominent peptide fragments of approximately  <dig> and 6 kda , suggesting the presence of an additional trypsin proteolytic site.

in order to better characterize ha2a and ha2b and identify their cleavage site, the protein bands were isolated and subjected to n-terminal  sequencing. the amino acid sequencing results from the edman analyses are shown in table  <dig>  the results confirm that purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha is produced in its mature form  with a conserved trypsin cleavage site at arginine position  <dig>  <cit> .  however, the ha <dig> polypeptide was found to possess an additional cleavage site at lysine position  <dig> .

n-terminal sequenced peptides were aligned with the h <dig> a/california/07/ <dig> amino acid sequence. the trypsin cleavage sites were identified based on sequence information and expasy proteomic tools .

the trypsin cleavage sites are presented as conserved  or additional cleavage sites  and additional cleavage site k- <dig> is shown in bold.

alignment of the amino acid sequences of a/california/07/ <dig> with a/new caledonia/20/ <dig>  a/brisbane/59/ <dig> and a/solomon islands/03/2006 h <dig> ha proteins was generated to determine whether sequences and secondary structure predictions could explain the trypsin digest results . the alignment results show that the three potential additional trypsin cleavage sites  are conserved among all four ha proteins; however, lysine- <dig> is unique to a/california/07/ <dig>  therefore, lysine– <dig> is the most likely primary protease digestion site that generates ha2a and ha2b. interestingly, according to expasy proteomics tools, amino acids  <dig> –  <dig> are predicted to form a coiled coil domain . a/california/07/ <dig> has six amino acid changes in this region, including lysine- <dig>  compared to the other ha proteins. these sequence differences could affect protein conformation and make this region more accessible to trypsin digestion.

biological activity
a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein was evaluated for functional activity by determining its hemagglutination activity using red blood cells  and comparing it to the activities of the 2000– <dig> seasonal h <dig> influenza strain rhas, a/new caledonia/20/ <dig>  a/solomon islands/03/ <dig> and a/brisbane/59/ <dig>  a prerequisite for hemagglutination activity is the formation of trimers and the organization of these trimers into higher order structures that can crosslink corresponding sialic acid receptors on cells. the a/california/07/ <dig> rha demonstrated hemagglutination activity with guinea pig and turkey rbcs but not chicken rbcs . this was most similar to the hemagglutination activity observed for a/solomon islands/03/ <dig> rha with guinea pig and turkey rbcs.

hemagglutination values were generated with guinea pig, chicken, and turkey rbcs and ha activity was calculated based on protein bca  values.

a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein activity was also analyzed using the srid assay. this assay measures the potency of influenza vaccines via quantification of functional ha protein  <cit> . four lots of a/california/07/ <dig> reference antigens corresponding to re-assortants x- <dig> and x-179a obtained from both the center for biologics evaluation and research  and the national institute for biological standards and control , and two lots of the a/california/07/ <dig> rha  were tested against three different antisera generated against hemagglutinin from a/california/07/ <dig> . the antisera were obtained from nibsc, cber and protein sciences corporation, and were generated using ha from egg, e. coli and bevs-insect cell sources, respectively. both the cber and protein sciences antisera were experimental and produced against recombinant ha proteins .

all of the antisera produced immunoprecipitin rings with all reference antigens and the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein , indicating that the rha protein was antigenically comparable. however, the nibsc antiserum generated against egg-derived antigen produced larger, more diffuse rings for the rha  that corresponded to calculated potency values that were 2- to 5-fold greater than the amount of purified rha protein inoculated into sample wells . in contrast to the nibsc antiserum, more well defined rings for rha were achieved using antiserum generated against recombinant antigens . interestingly, both the reference antigens and two separate licensed apdm <dig> monovalent vaccines  reacted differently with the three antisera, suggesting a unique interaction of each antiserum with each hemagglutinin produced from the a/california/07/ <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> virus. these differences had a significant impact on the calculated potency of the commercial vaccines  and demonstrate the need to have well-matched reagents for the pandemic h <dig> vaccine antigens in manufactured products.

srid potency values are listed in μg/ml. results were calculated using x- <dig> or x-179a reference antigens obtained from cber or nibsc, using srid gels prepared with sheep antiserum obtained from nibsc against egg-derived a/california/07/ <dig> ha, sheep antiserum obtained from cber against e. coli-expressed recombinant ha <dig> fragment, or rabbit antiserum produced by protein sciences corporation  against purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha.

finally, trivalent formulations of purified rha vaccine corresponding to the 2008– <dig> and 2010– <dig> seasonal influenza strains, the latter of which contained a/california/07/ <dig> rha, were prepared to compare the immune responses of the different vaccine components. a commercial egg-based 2009– <dig> vaccine  was included as a control. cd- <dig> mice were administered two doses of the respective formulations at 21 day intervals, and hemagglutination inhibition  antibody titers were determined three weeks after each dose. the immunogenicity results are provided in table  <dig> 

hai titers were measured on serum samples collected 21 days after immunizations  for the respective vaccine components and the geometric mean titer  calculated.

there was a clear dose dependence of the hai response to all vaccine components across the test formulations, and the magnitude of the response increased from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after the second immunization. the immune response generated against a/california/07/ <dig>  rha antigen was equal to or slightly greater than that of a/brisbane/59/ <dig>  rha antigen and the commercial egg-based a/california/07/ <dig>  control by day  <dig>  the immune responses were also consistent for the h <dig> and b vaccine antigen components. these results demonstrate that rha antigens, including a/california/07/ <dig> rha, produce a robust immune response.

discussion
the apdm <dig> influenza vaccine was available late and in short supply as a result of delays in production caused by low yields, poor antigen stability and absence of virus stockpile. recombinant hemagglutinin-based vaccines are inherently less susceptible to production challenges and are a leading alternative for influenza vaccine manufacture. the most advanced recombinant influenza vaccine candidate is a trivalent formulation of seasonal rha proteins that can be produced significantly faster than traditional egg-based influenza vaccines and has been shown to be as effective and safe as egg-derived trivalent inactivated vaccine  in human clinical trials. pandemic rha vaccines hold similar promise.

this in-depth characterization of a/california/07/ <dig> rha showed that it is biochemically, biophysically, and antigenically comparable to seasonal rha antigens. a/california/07/ <dig> rha had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of seasonal rha proteins and formed higher order, multimeric rosette-like particles of approximately 20–40 nm. this is in contrast to the findings of khurana et al. who expressed full length a/california/07/ <dig> ha in a bacterial expression system and found that the purified protein migrated predominantly as a monomer  <cit> . the reason for this difference is unknown but could relate to the different expression platforms. a/california/07/ <dig> rha demonstrated significant biological activity and elicited a strong immune response in mice consistent with that generated by commercial egg-derived a/california/07/ <dig> vaccine both in this study and previously  <cit> . together, these data support the suitability of a/california/07/ <dig> rha as a pandemic influenza vaccine alternative. an initial clinical study has confirmed the safety and immunogenicity of this rha  <cit> .

the antigenic stability of the apdm <dig> vaccine was found to be initially poor  <cit> . trypsin digestion of purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha uncovered a unique susceptibility of the protein to proteolytic cleavage not found in the seasonal rha comparators. n-terminal  sequencing revealed that this cleavage occurs in a subdomain of the ha <dig> region of the protein that for most ha proteins are predicted to be structured as a coiled-coil. we postulate that the six amino acid changes in this domain in a/california/07/ <dig> ha may disrupt this structure, leading to decreased antigenic stability. further studies are needed to determine whether the virus re-assortants ultimately used for egg-based apdm <dig> vaccine manufacture possessed modifications that impacted protein structure in this region, improving antigen stability. preliminary assessment suggests that a purified recombinant rha derived from re-assortant virus nibrg-121xp  <cit>  in fact remained unstable although its interaction with sialic acid receptors was improved .

finally, the antigenic potency of a/california/07/ <dig> rha, as determined by the srid assay, showed dramatic heterogeneity  depending on the assay reagents used. a similar effect was observed for licensed egg-derived monovalent vaccines. this variation indicates that preparation of reagents for potency testing  with novel pandemic influenza viruses requires further assessment to accommodate recombinant manufacturing strategies available for rapid pandemic response. moreover, the development of alternative potency assays that are less dependent upon specific antigen-antibody interactions that could be affected by the manufacturing platform is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
these results show that the production of purified recombinant hemagglutinin  subunit vaccines via the baculovirus expression system is a leading alternative platform for influenza vaccine manufacture. the biochemical, biophysical and immunological characterization of a purified recombinant a/california/07/ <dig>  hemagglutinin has been compared to different seasonal rha proteins and egg-produced a/california reagents. the data show that purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha molecules exist in high molecular weight complexes and form rosette-like particles of  <dig> – 40 nm in size. biochemically, the protein exhibits hemagglutination activity and a greater sensitivity to tryptic digestion with additional cleavage in the ha <dig> subunit. the unique structure of this particular ha antigen may account for poor stability. the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein was found to be antigenically similar to egg-derived virus and showed immunogenicity and development of neutralizing antibody titers in mice.
