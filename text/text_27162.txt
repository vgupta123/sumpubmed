BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to a tiling array  is a cost-effective and routinely used method for identifying target genes of transcription factors, for analyzing histone modifications or for studying the methylome on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . in a chip-chip experiment, a chromatin immunoprecipitation sample  is compared against a reference sample of genomic dna . in recent years, different methods for the identification of chip-enriched regions have been developed. among them,  <cit>  proposed a linear regression mixture model named chipmix, designed to perform a joint modeling of ip and input measurements. this two-component mixture model discriminates the population of enriched probes from non-enriched ones. over the last years, chipmix has successfully been applied to the identification of methylated gene promoters, histone modifications or transcription factor target genes . however, chipmix has basically two important limitations: it does not model spatial dependencies between adjacent probes on chromosomes and it also does not handle the joint analysis of multiple biological replicates.

here, we present multichipmixhmm for chip-chip analyses enabling modeling of spatial dependencies and a simultaneous analysis of replicates to further improve the identification of enriched probes. we demonstrate improved performance of multichipmixhmm compared to chipmix for the target identification of the chromatin mark h3k27me <dig> of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana.

implementation
multichipmixhmm is based on a two-state first-order hidden markov model  with state-specific gaussian emission distributions modeling immunoprecipated signals as a linear regression of reference input signals. let  be the pair of log-input and log-ip intensities of probe t measured in replicate r of a chip-chip experiment. the hidden state of probe t is modeled by zt∈{ <dig> } to distinguish enriched  from non-enriched probes . the gaussian emission density of state zt modeling r replicates is given by a product of independent gaussian distributions

 f=∏r=1rn 

with specific mean aztr+bztrxtr and variance σr <dig> for each replicate r∈{ <dig> …,r}. dependencies between adjacent genomic probes t and t+ <dig> are modeled by a first-order markov chain defining that the next state zt+ <dig> is depending on the predecessor state zt. all parameters of the hmm are estimated using the baum-welch algorithm  <cit>  representing a special case of the em algorithm  <cit> . to obtain relevant initial values of the emission distribution parameters , we applied a principal component analysis to each biological replicate and used the first axis to derive the intercept and slope of the regression. all initial transition parameters are set to  <dig> . this reflects the typical case where no biological information is available. we observed on simulations that alternative choices for the transition matrix initialization lead to similar results . identification of enriched probes is based on conditional probabilities. a probe is declared enriched if its enriched conditional probability  is higher than 1−α, where α is chosen by the user. this strategy has been proved to yield in controlling the proportion of misclassification in mixture models  <cit> .

RESULTS
simulations
in this section, we first compare chipmix, multichipmixhmm and tilehmm  <cit> , which is a method based on an hmm model to analyze the logratios . moreover tilehmm can handle multiple replicates. we simulated data according to a two-state hmm with state-specific gaussian emission distributions modeling immunoprecipated signals as a linear regression of reference input signals. we considered two test scenarios:  well-separated non-enriched and enriched probes  and  overlapping populations of non-enriched and enriched probes . two biological replicates are simulated for each scenario. the transition matrix is set to  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> and the variances are set to  <dig>  for the first replicate and  <dig>  for the second. we used the corresponding method-specific conditional probabilities for probes to be enriched to display roc curves. for chipmix, that returns a set of probe conditional probabilities per replicate, we summarized the results by taking either the minimal  conditional probabilities over the two replicates.

on the roc curves, we can observe that multichipmixhmm outperforms the other methods whatever the scenario . we further analyse the results after classification by choosing a level α= <dig> .

the comparison is performed in table  <dig>  while conservative, chipmix and multichipmixhmm correctly control the proportion of fp at the required  <dig>  level. on the contrary, tilehmm results in a higher tp rate, but to the price of a fp rate ten time higher than the required level.

arabidopsis dataset analysis
to illustrate the benefit of using multichipmixhmm compared to standard chipmix, we use a normalized chip-chip data set of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana by  <cit>  to compare the identification of genomic regions marked by histone h <dig> tri-methylated at lysine  <dig> . we applied both methods to analyze the two biological replicates and identified probes enriched in h3k27me <dig> using a stringent cutoff of 1−α= <dig> . since chipmix does not handle multiple replicates, both replicates were analyzed separately and only probes declared as enriched in both replicates were finally considered as enriched .

considering the decodings of individual probes, chipmix and multichipmixhmm provide the same status prediction  for more than 90% of the probes. focusing on enriched probes, all the  <dig>  probes identified by chipmix are also included in the set of enriched probes identified by multichipmixhmm. multichipmixhmm also identified  <dig>  additional probes enriched in h3k27me <dig>  in good agreement with previous findings  <cit> , we find that probes marked by h3k27me <dig> are preferentially associated with genes. chipmix found about  <dig> enriched probes associated with genes while there are approximately  <dig> more for multichipmixhmm. among these  <dig> additional probes, about  <dig> complete regions already found by chipmix, while  <dig> probes concern  <dig> new genes. we further analyzed the identified  <dig> genes targeted by h3k27me <dig> that have been identified by both methods. considering multichipmixhmm, these genes are covered by  <dig> enriched probes compared to only  <dig> enriched probes identified by chipmix. thus, the modeling of spatial dependencies between probes by multichipmixhmm leads to a better modeling of enriched probes along genes. furthermore, multichipmixhmm identified  <dig> new target genes. this is exemplarily illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  where additional probes identified as enriched by multichipmixhmm extend or complete enriched regions identified by chipmix.

to further validate these findings, we use known h3k27me <dig> target genes based on independent prior studies by  <cit>  and by  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes found by both studies,  <dig> were commonly identified by chipmix and multichipmixhmm. additionally, multichipmixhmm identifies  <dig> genes exclusively, which have already been identified as target genes in at least one of the two studies. importantly, this increase of detection power comes without an additional computational time, because the main algorithm of multichipmixhmm is implemented in c.

CONCLUSIONS
the r package multichipmixhmm implements a linear regression mixture model to analyse chip-chip data. in order to provide a more accurate identification of enriched probes, it enables to take into account spatial dependencies between directly adjacent probes and a simultaneous analysis of replicates. the benefits of multichipmixhmm have been shown by analyzing both simulated and real datasets, and by comparing competing softwares.

availability and requirements
multichipmixhmm is publicly available as an r package from cran  <cit> . two functions are implemented and refer to the models describe before. to distinguish between the model and the function, the first letter of the name of the function is a lower case:  multichipmixhmm for modeling spatial dependencies and multiple replicates and  multichipmix to model multiple replicates ignoring spatial dependencies between probes. both functions take as input a vector of filenames , and display as output a file containing the enriched conditional probability and status of each probe.
