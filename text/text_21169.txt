BACKGROUND
climatic oscillations during the pleistocene are known to have had a dramatic role in shaping the diversity and distribution of many african plant and animal species  <cit> . several large-scale studies that tested this hypothesis have been carried out on large african mammals  <cit> . however, these animals are vagile and often broadly disperse or have large home ranges. therefore, small mammals are excellent models for testing patterns of pan-african biogeography. there have been a few studies on sub-saharan rodents  <cit> , but shrews , a group known to have been used elsewhere to test pleistocene climate oscillation models  <cit> , have not been examined across broad ecological areas on the continent. these animals have short life spans, rapid reproduction cycles, low dispersal abilities and respond quickly to environmental changes  <cit> , and are therefore a good model to investigate climate-driven models of diversification. all available genetic studies of african shrews focussed on taxa with relatively small geographical distributions . members of the crocidura olivieri  complex  <cit> , which have notably large body size for shrews and can weigh up to  <dig> g  <cit> , are a rare example of a widespread afrotropical soricid taxon. members of the c. olivieri complex occur in a variety of habitats, including tropical rain forests, marshes, savannah and montane areas  <cit> . therefore, this group is a potentially excellent model to test how climatic oscillations and associated changes in vegetation during the pleistocene influenced their distribution and diversification.

models employed to understand diversification events within vertebrates faunas are too numerous to review in detail here. by and large, hypotheses concerning factors that promote speciation in tropical faunas have been preoccupied with the geographical context of speciation and fall into two categories: allopatric and parapatric models. with allopatric models, extrinsic barriers to gene flow lead to the separation of sub-populations, which evolve differently associated with genetic drift and natural selection. for example, the “pleistocene forest refuge” hypothesis, originally formulated for tropical south america and then applied to the afrotropics, postulates that during the last  <dig>  myr, climatic oscillations caused phases of contraction and expansion of different vegetation types  <cit> . severe and long-lasting dry and cold periods reduced forests to isolated remnants or ‘refuges’ allowing diversification and allopatric speciation  <cit> . the “riverine barrier” hypothesis argues that rivers acted as physical barriers associated with the distribution of certain taxa, promoting diversification  <cit> . allopatric models have been invoked to explain the current distribution and diversity of african small mammal species  <cit> . the gradient model of diversification  has been proposed as an alternative to allopatric models  <cit> . it suggests that strong environmental gradients result in adaptive divergence and speciation for taxa tolerant of a broad range of habitats. a recent study has emphasized the role of habitat gradients in lineage diversification in the african rodent cricetomys  <cit> .

the taxonomy of the c. olivieri complex has been discussed for almost a century but uncertainties remain. species currently considered valid within the c. olivieri complex are distributed across different habitats: c. goliath thomas,  <dig> is endemic to rain forests of the congo basin, c. viaria  and c. fulvastra  are encountered in the sudanian savannah from morocco to kenya and from mali to ethiopia, respectively, and c. olivieri is widespread across portions of the african continent  <cit> .

the specific aims of this study are: 1) to provide a greater understanding of the systematics of african giant shrews of the c. olivieri complex, specifically specimens identified based on morphology as c. olivieri, c. viaria, c. fulvastra or c. goliath; 2) to test for the respective roles of forest retraction/expansion, rivers , ecological gradients  and anthropogenic factors in explaining the diversification and current distribution of the different lineages. in order to infer biogeographical scenarios at the scale of the african continent and to answer questions concerning possible factors promoting diversification within the complex, we used data from three mitochondrial and four nuclear markers and conducted phylogenetic and population genetics analyses on animals originating from most of its geographical range .figure  <dig> sampling points and clade distributions. map of sampling points showing the distribution of the phylogenetic clades identified in the bayesian phylogenetic analyses:  <dig> main clades of the clade vii: c. somalica and clade viii: c. hera complex , subclades within clade i , subclades within clade iv  and subclades within clade v . ecological divisions based on white’s  vegetation map. see additional file  <dig> for localities names and gps coordinates.



RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships
based on bayesian inference of combined data from the seven markers  the c. olivieri complex  forms a highly supported monophyletic group . this complex is the sister clade to a clade composed of c. flavescens and c. hirta. the clade composed of these seven species is reciprocally monophyletic with respect to c. lamottei. within the c. olivieri complex, eight main clades can be identified. clades i, ii, iv, vi and viii are composed of specimens assigned to c. olivieri based on morphology. specimens assigned to c. viaria and c. fulvastra are gathered in clade iii but do not form two monophyletic groups. phylogenetic relationships are poorly resolved within this clade. clade v comprises all specimens originally identified as c. goliath and clade vii the two specimens morphologically identified as c. somalica. clades i + ii, i-to-iii, i-to-iv, vi + vii and i-to-vii are strongly monophyletic. clade i-to-v is not supported .figure  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the crocidura olivieri complex. final phylogenetic tree for members of the crocidura olivieri complex using one specimen per locality and per clade, with  <dig> individual specimens. tree built using bayesian inference and data from three mitochondrial  and four nuclear markers  for a combined total of 5305 bp. values above branches are bayesian posterior probabilities. the branchlets are identified by specimen numbers defined in additional file  <dig>  a simplified representation of the tree is shown in the upper framed window .



the topology obtained through analysis of mtdna data  is very similar to the former, some nodes not recovered  or only poorly supported . based on nuclear data , the specimens referred to c. olivieri, c. viaria, c. fulvastra, c. goliath, c. somalica, c. flavescens and c. hirta form a monophyletic group. in the c. olivieri complex, only clades vi  and viii  can be retrieved . the other clades  were not recovered, presumably because of low variability in the nuclear data. crocidura hirta forms a highly supported clade that is reciprocally monophyletic with c. flavescens.

no mtdna haplotype was shared between clades i to viii. several main clades shared between them a single nuclear haplotype: clades i, ii and iii for brca1; clades i and iii for riok3; clades i and ii, clades iv and v, clades iv and viii and clades i, ii and iv for hdac2; and clades i, ii, iii, iv and v, clades iv and vi and clades iv and v for stat5a.

phylogeography of the c. olivieri complex
individual specimens from the eight main clades in the c. olivieri complex can occur in sympatry, especially in central africa . six subclades can be identified within clade i, but phylogenetic relationships are not resolved. clade i is composed of specimens obtained at forest or mixed forest-savannah sites  of western africa , including individuals trapped in houses. individuals placed in subclades i-c and i-d  occur on the left bank  of the sassandra river in western côte d’ivoire and specimens of subclade i-e  on the right bank . clades i-d and i-e are sister clades with a low node support value .

clade ii includes specimens, which were trapped in the sudanian savannah zone, north of the guinean forest block and in the dahomey gap in ghana, benin, togo, nigeria, southern niger, burkina faso and southwestern mali. clade iii encompasses all sequenced individuals identified as c. viaria  and c. fulvastra ; these specimens were collected on the northern fringe of the sudanian and sahelian savannah zones, except for animals from southern cameroon obtained in forests, croplands and oil palm plantations.

clade iv is composed of specimens obtained in a broad range of habitats . the geographic range of this species group extends throughout central and eastern africa with isolated localities in egypt . the subclade iv-a  is composed of specimens from the east and southeast of the continent, all of them from the right bank of the congo river . the northern subclade iv-b  is encountered in cameroon, car, eastern congo, egypt, ethiopia and southern sudan, on the right bank of the congo and ubangi rivers. the subclade iv-c  is found in drc and northeastern zambia, on the left bank of the congo river, except for specimens from the ntumbachushi falls . clades iv-a and iv-b appear as sister clades but this relationship is not supported .

specimens of clade v originate from the central african rain forests on the right bank of the ubangi-congo river. subclades v-b  and v-d  + specimen r <dig>  exhibit an allopatric distribution on each side of the ogooué river: subclade v-b occurs on the left bank and subclade v-d and the isolated specimen on the right bank. makande is situated between the ogooué river and one of its tributaries, the ougoulou river. the individuals representing clade vi originate from congo and car rain forest. several subclades are observed within this clade but specimens do not cluster by their geographical positions. they are largely sympatric with c. goliath .

specimens of clade vii originate from mesic places in the mago national park in southwestern ethiopia, where they were trapped in plain savannah with dense shrubs. clade viii is composed of specimens from northern mozambique and southern malawi that were obtained in montane forest ‘islands’ including gallery forests. this clade is bounded by the shire river to the west, the zambezi river to the south, open savannah woodland to the east and lake malawi to the north.

divergence time estimates inferred using a standard mammalian mutation rate of  <dig> % per myr  <cit>  are between  <dig>  and  <dig> % lower than those obtained with fossil calibration points. the time to the most recent common ancestor of the complex is estimated after  <dig>  ma . the bifurcation between clades i-to-v and vi + vii is dated after  <dig>  ma  and that between clade v and i-to-iv after  <dig>  ma . the most recent divergence event corresponds to the split between clades i and ii and is dated after  <dig>  ma . all these estimates fall within 95% intervals inferred from the analysis using calibration points. we therefore chose to base our biogeographic scenario hypotheses on fossil calibrations.

historical demography
based on mitochondrial data , the nucleotide diversity  ranges from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with a decrease from clade iv to clade i. haplotype diversity ranges from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with a decrease from clade v to clade ii . based on mismatch distributions, a signal of demographic expansion was detected for all clades except for clade vi. the mode of the curve  showed the highest value for clade iv, followed by clade v and the lowest value for clade i. a signal of spatial expansion was detected for all clades. the fu’s fs neutrality tests indicated significant population growth for clades i, iv and v. a spatial expansion was detected for clades iv . extended skyline plot analyses revealed demographic growth for clades i, iii and iv based on numbers of population changes   <cit> .table  <dig>

discussion
alternative models to explain speciation and diversification events within the crocidura olivieri complex
forest refuge theory
all divergence events within the c. olivieri complex occurred after  <dig>   ma, i.e. when the periodicity of glacial cycles switched from  <dig>  to  <dig>  years and induced prolonged periods of aridity on africa  <cit> . divergence between clades i-to-v, vi, vii and viii occurred around  <dig> - <dig>   ma. these dates should be interpreted with caution given the wide divergence time intervals. on the african continent, the period around 1 ma was characterized by notable aridity coinciding with a reduction of lowland forests and an expansion of savannah biomes  <cit> . this period coincides with divergence events for other african forest mammals  <cit> . given that clades v, vi and viii include forest-dwelling animals  and that these clades have allopatric or parapatric distributions, most of the early divergence events within the complex are congruent with the “pleistocene forest refuge” hypothesis  <cit> : several populations of the complex may have been isolated for long periods in distinct forest refuges, favouring allopatric diversification.

several central africa refuges have been identified and provide insight into the current distribution of clades v, vi and viii. two refuges were described in the western part of the congo basin, the first near the massif du chaillu in southern gabon and southern congo and the second near monts de cristal in northern gabon, equatorial guinea and southern cameroon  <cit> . within c. goliath, the distributions of clades v-b  and v-d are coincident with the monts de cristal and massif du chaillu refuges, respectively. clade viii is composed of members from two montane inselbergs, one in southern malawi  and the second in northern mozambique , in the malawi rift. this rift forms a southern extension of the albertine rift. their ancient age of divergence is consistent with this section of the rift valley being an early isolate from the main section of the albertine rift valley to the north . two refuges occur on the albertine rift near the border of drc and uganda: the ruwenzori mountains and ituri forest  <cit> .

clade i is essentially encountered in guinean forests. the phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved for the six clades i-a to i-f, which exhibit largely disjunct, but in some cases overlapping geographical ranges. this pattern is congruent with an ancestral population having experienced rapid habitat fragmentation, such as forest retraction during arid climatic phases, resulting in lineage sorting and then divergence between allopatric populations  <cit> . the genetic structure and distribution of clade i show similar patterns to that of the rodent praomys rostratus  <cit> , in which the observed distribution of two sister clades i-d and i-e fits the hypothesized areas of two pleistocene forest refuges, one in southwestern ghana and the other in côte d’ivoire, liberia and southeastern guinea  <cit> . however, this hypothesis has to be considered with caution owing to the weak support of the monophyly of clade i-d + i-e.

gradient model of diversification
the split between clade v and clades i-to-iv is dated after  <dig>  ma , which corresponds to a new geological period of aridity and forest retraction  <cit> . diminishing forested habitats and the progression of savannah might have facilitated a niche displacement at the forest-savannah ecotone. as populations belonging to clade v are typically forest-dwelling, whereas those of clades i-to-iv are frequently trapped in savannah and secondarily in forests, an ecological gradient model of diversification  <cit>  may be invoked to understand these divergence events. as the ancestral population of clades i to v probably inhabited central african forests , dispersal is postulated to have occurred from forest habitat to a mosaic of habitats composed of forest-savannah, and then to savannah. this resulted in parapatric differentiation along an ecological gradient via natural selection.

the most recent successive splits of clades iv, iii, ii and i complex occurred after  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  ma . each of these diversification events includes taxa currently showing parapatric distributions, with cases of syntopy at some localities. the distributions of these clades can be superimposed on the major african floristic zones   <cit> : clade iv is recorded mainly from central african forests and croplands surrounded by a mosaic of forest and sudanian savannah and woodlands of eastern africa; clade iii from drier sudanian and sahelian savannah; clade ii from western african sudanian savannah; and clade i mainly from guinean forests. these geographical distributions occur along a geographical and ecological gradient and sister clades occupy adjacent and distinct habitats with some overlap; patterns typical of predictions from the gradient model of diversification  <cit> . it is hypothesized that the associated cladogenesis events occurred close to the current contact zones between these clades. these events may be related to the southward progression of the sahara and sahelian savannah during glacial cycles, as shown for taterillus gerbils over the past  <dig> myr  <cit> . although estimates of divergence times need to be interpreted with caution, we can assume that climatic oscillations during the pleistocene probably played an important role in the diversification of the c. olivieri complex, as already proposed for several african rodents  <cit> .

riverine barriers
rivers can promote allopatric diversification by separating a population into two vicariant subpopulations that form sister clades  <cit> . such patterns can be observed within the c. olivieri complex and have been described in other african mammals: clades i and ii and the genus praomys along the volta river  <cit> ; clades iv-a + iv-b vs iv-c and other mammal taxa along the congo-ubangi river  <cit> . this hypothesis should be considered with caution owing to the weak support of the monophyly of clade iv-a + iv-b.

rivers can also restrict gene flow between populations that have diverged through other means. when rivers are the proximal, but not the causal mechanism of diversification, distinct genetic clades can be observed on opposite banks but are not necessarily sister clades. in agreement with the river barrier hypothesis, we found clades v and vi to be geographically restricted to the right bank of the congo-ubangi river and clade iv-c restricted to the left bank. the specimen from makandé forms a singleton group and its distribution appears restricted to the area between the ogooué and ougoulou rivers. the ogooué river is known to constrain the distribution of the primate mandrillus sphinx  <cit> . clade v is only found south of the sanaga river, which is the distribution limit for numerous mammal species  <cit> . within clade i, the sassandra river seems to limit gene flow between clades situated on each side , as already observed in other small mammal  <cit> . it seems likely that large modern watercourses have remained stable over the past 1 ma with regards to their trajectory, but with variable water levels. only few data are available concerning rivers’ histories, which are often traced using phylogeographical patterns  <cit> .

from a forest origin to a wide ecological success throughout africa
origin of the c. olivieri complex in central/eastern africa and first radiation in the congo basin
animals occurring within clades v to viii, the most basal, are endemic either to eastern or central africa, but the topology of the phylogenetic tree does not provide a precise signal as to the origin of the c. olivieri complex. individuals associated with clades v and vi were captured in lowland rain forests of the congo basin, so the most likely scenario is that early members of the complex colonized this watershed. a radiation then occurred within forest ecosystems, probably correlated with increase in body size.

only a few specimens of clades vi , vii  and viii  were available and a possible explanation of their rarity could be competition. indeed, distribution of clade vi seems to be limited to the easternmost fringe of the distribution of clade v, i.e. c. goliath. no other basal lineage than clade viii was found in the albertine rift and it can be speculated that they were replaced on most of albertine and southern rift mountains during pleistocene by individuals of clade iv-a, which represent the expanding population of animals with larger body size. clade viii thus represents a relict population. another explanation to the low effectives of clades vi to viii could be some form of habitat segregation due to strict ecological requirements. indeed, specimens of clade vii were trapped only in mesic places in shrubby savannah and specimens of clade viii only along streams in dense montane forest.

exit from forests approximately  <dig>  ma and colonization of other habitats
specimens of clade i-to-iv are encountered in many habitats  of the african continent and from senegal to ethiopia and from chad to south africa, whereas clades v, vi and viii would be restricted to congolese or montane forests. these patterns support an important relaxing of habitat requirements after  <dig>   ma and more precisely, a partial exit out of forest, congruent with the gradient model of diversification. this event may have dramatically expanded the dispersal abilities within the complex and could explain its subsequent ecological success across much of the african continent. a marked signal of recent population and range expansion was detected for clade iv. crocidura olivieri  is one of the most abundant shrew species in different small mammal communities  <cit> .

colonization of northern and western africa and secondary return to a forest habitat
a pattern of colonization from the congo basin toward northern africa and then western africa is consistent with the asymmetric topology of the mitochondrial and concatenated trees  and estimates of genetic diversity. a progressive decline in population nucleotide and haplotype diversity from central  to western africa  can be observed. population expansion occurred earlier in central africa  than in western africa . the colonization of western africa is postulated to have started after  <dig>  ma   and the ancestral population of clade i-to-iii may have then expanded westward along the sahelian savannah corridor . interestingly, the recently diverged clade i is essentially encountered in guinean forests, while its sister clade  is restricted to the surrounding sudanian savannah, which we interpret as a return to the original forest habitat.

the role of human movements in the dispersion of the c. olivieri complex
specimens of clade i-to-iv were trapped in towns and villages and in some cases in houses . owing to this previously reported synanthropic behaviour for members of the complex  <cit> , human activities may have played a role in the dispersal of these animals. specimens were captured in three isolated localities  but geographic distances are not correlated with genetic distances, i.e. these specimens show little genetic separation with respect to other representatives of their clades.

other parallel examples are known from different african small mammals. records of the synanthropic rodent arvicanthis niloticus in the sudanese nile may be related to the expansion of early humans from central africa northwards along the nile valley  <dig> – <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the rodent mus jotterandi is thought to have migrated from sub-saharan africa to morocco during the middle pleistocene   <cit> . similar patterns can be invoked to explain occurrence of the c. olivieri complex in northern africa. the sanaga river is recognized as a barrier to dispersal for several mammal taxa  <cit> . however, animals associated with clade iii are recorded from both sides of this river. this clade probably originated in dry savannah and its distribution may be linked to human movements from northern dry cameroon to the south, even across sanaga.

insight into the systematics of the c. olivieri complex
recent molecular data have shown paraphyly within c. olivieri and close phylogenetic relationships with c. viaria and c. fulvastra; all three taxa are also genetically close to c. goliath  <cit> . our study sheds new light on the taxonomy of the complex. based on a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data, c. goliath from the congo basin appears to be monophyletic . crocidura olivieri is polyphyletic and divided into five geographical clades showing allopatric or parapatric distributions. molecular data from specimens collected close to the type locality of the nominate form  were obtained  and their assignment to clade iv-b suggests that clade iv represents c. olivieri sensu stricto. specimens of c. viaria and c. fulvastra are included in the well-supported clade iii with parapatric distributions vis-à-vis other clades. owing to the weakness of the phylogenetic signal, reciprocal monophyly of the two species could not be assessed. dubey et al. already mentioned the paraphyly of c. olivieri with respect to c. viaria and c. fulvastra  <cit> .

however, owing to aspects of sample size, number of base pairs employed and distribution of collection sites, dubey et al.  <cit>  did not recover the clades vi, vii and viii and several nodes in their phylogeny were not well-supported. genetic distances between clades i to iv range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % based on cytb data. these values fall within the range of intraspecific variation described for the genus crocidura  and well below interspecific variation . based on the coi marker, genetic distances between clades i to iv range from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the range of intraspecific variation described for the genus crocidura is 0- <dig> % and that of interspecific variation  <dig> - <dig> %  <cit> . our results therefore question the taxonomic status of c. viaria and c. fulvastra. on the other hand, the clades vi, vii and viii may represent separate species, with the level of genetic divergence comparable to c. goliath. crocidura somalica , described from middle webi shebeli near geledi, ethiopia, is part of the c. olivieri complex. on the basis of morphology, animals falling within clade viii match the description of c. occidentalis hera dollman,  <dig> named from shire highlands, malawi. this locality and localities  <dig> and  <dig>  are in close proximity and are isolated from adjacent landscapes by the shire river to the west, the zambezi river to the south and dry lowland savannah to the east. these results indicate that the c. oliveri complex is in need of a taxonomic revision, best accomplished with combined data on genetics, morphology and ecology.

CONCLUSIONS
our study sheds new light on the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of the c. oliveri complex. using sampling encompassing the known geographical range of the complex, a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data and several analyses , we propose an evolutionary scenario for this complex. we postulate an origin in central/eastern africa followed by a colonization and radiation in rain forests of the congo basin. an emigration from this biotope took place approximately  <dig>  ma. members of the complex then colonized eastern and western africa across a considerable range of savannah and forest habitats. cladogenesis events and changes in habitat and ecology were probably influenced by climatic oscillations during the last  <dig> myr. we tested several models providing insights into underlying mechanisms associated with the diversification of the complex and found that a variety of factors can explain their current phylogeographic structure and distribution: pleistocene forest refuges, riverine barriers, differentiation along environmental gradients and probable human related introductions.

this study reveals the need of taxonomic revision of the c. olivieri complex. we confirm the validity of c. goliath from the congo basin but, however, c. olivieri appears polyphyletic and divided into five geographical clades showing allopatric or parapatric distributions. we did not recover monophyly of c. viaria and c. fulvastra owing to their close genetic relationships. values of genetic distances between clades i to iv  fall well below interspecific variation described among shrews, suggesting their merger into a single and widespread species. clades vi, vii  and viii may represent separate species, pending on a revision of available taxon names.
