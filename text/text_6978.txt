BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a highly heterogeneous species of γ proteobacteria  <cit> . saprophytic members of this species are found in large numbers in all of the major natural environments and also form associations with plants  <cit> . surprisingly, p. fluorescens includes some strains suspected to be opportunistic human pathogens  <cit> . recently, and despite its psychrotrophy   <cit> , several studies highlighted the infectious potential of some pseudomonas fluorescens clinical strains  <cit> . mfn <dig> is a clinical strain, identified as belonging to biovar i of p. fluorescens species, which was isolated from a patient with a lung infection and is able to grow at 37°c  <cit> . we previously described that mfn <dig> cells induce necrosis and apoptosis in rat glial cells at this temperature. this strain adheres to intestinal epithelial cells where it induces cytotoxic effects and proinflammatory reactions  <cit> . mfn <dig> displays secretion-mediated hemolytic activity involving phospholipase c and cyclolipopeptides  <cit> . this activity is positively regulated by the two-component system gacs/gaca and is subject to phase variation  <cit> . mfn <dig> shows a cell-associated hemolytic activity distinct from the secreted hemolytic activity. the cell-associated hemolytic activity  is expressed at 37°c and is detected in vitro in mid log growth phase in the presence of erythrocytes. this cha is independent of phospholipase c and cyclolipopeptide production and increases in a gaca mutant. gacs/gaca seems to be a negative regulator of this activity. finally, mfn <dig> harbours type iii secretion system  genes  <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa cha strain, cell-associated hemolytic activity is correlated with secretion of pcrv, popb and popd by t3ss. this pore forming activity precedes macrophage oncosis  <cit> . in addition, numerous studies have reported the implication of t3ss in the infectivity of p. aeruginosa in dictyostelium discoideum. d. discoideum is a soil amoeba that feeds on bacteria by phagocytosis  <cit> . it was used as a model eukaryotic cell, which mimics mammalian macrophage in how it interacts with microbes. p. aeruginosa can kill d. discoideum by delivering effector proteins to target cells  <cit> .

t3ss genes are absent from the p. fluorescens pf0- <dig> and pf <dig> genomes published in databases  <cit>  but are present in numerous plant-associated and biocontrol p. fluorescens strains  <cit> . strain kd protects the cucumber from the oomycete pythium ultimum, and its t3ss, acquired horizontally from phytopathogenic bacteria, decreases pectinase polygalacturonase activity  from p. ultimum <cit> . this strain does not induce a hypersensitivity response  on tobacco leaves. in c7r <dig> and sbw <dig>  two other biocontrol strains with t3ss genes, the target of t3ss has not been fully elucidated  <cit> . in p. fluorescens q8r1- <dig>  t3ss is different from its counterparts in sbw <dig> and similar to p. syringae t3ss. this strain expresses t3ss effectors capable of suppressing hr  <cit> .

mfn <dig> possesses some contrasting features of saprophytic or pathogenic pseudomonas in regards to t3ss. mfn <dig> has t3ss-like genes, hrcrst, with a high level of homology to the hrcrst genes of the hrpu operon in pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  disruption of this hrpu-like operon in mfn <dig> abolishes cell-associated hemolytic activity  <cit> , as described for mutations in the t3ss apparatus in p. aeruginosa. our hypothesis was that the first target of mfn <dig> t3ss would probably be eukaryotic cells of the rhizosphere, such as plants or amoebae.

to test this hypothesis, we investigated the interactions of mfn <dig> and other pseudomonas strains with red blood cells, plants, amoebae and macrophages. in contrast with environmental pseudomonas, all of the clinical strains of p. fluorescens tested were cytotoxic for erythrocytes through contact. mfn <dig> was unable to induce hr on plants and was cytotoxic for amoebae and macrophages. disruption of the hrpu-like operon in mfn <dig> abolished these cytotoxicities that were independent of cyclolipopeptide production. gacs/gaca system seems to be a positive regulator for d. discoideum growth inhibition but not for cell-associated hemolysis or macrophage lysis, suggesting that these processes are not identical.

RESULTS
p. fluorescens mfn <dig> and other clinical strains have cell-associated hemolytic activity but do not induce hr on tobacco leaves
we investigated the distribution of cell-associated hemolytic activity on a panel of pseudomonas strains. cell-associated hemolytic activity  was measured by the technique used by dacheux  <cit> , adapted as described in methods. we tested cha at 37°c for mfn <dig>  mfy <dig>  mfy <dig> and mfy <dig> , mf <dig> , c7r <dig> and sbw <dig>  and dc <dig>  after growth at 28°c . 

only clinical strains had cha . mfy <dig> showed the highest level of cha ; mfy <dig> and mfn <dig> displayed significant cha  and mfy <dig> a median cha . in the case of the environmental strains tested, c7r <dig>  sbw <dig>  mf <dig> and dc <dig> were not hemolytic.

the same panel of strains was tested on tobacco leaves to determine if these strains were able to induce hr. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  hr was only detected for c7r <dig> and dc <dig>  all clinical strains i.e., mfy <dig>  mfy <dig>  mfy <dig> and mfn <dig> and two environmental strains, sbw <dig> and mf <dig>  were unable to induce hr.

p. fluorescens mfn <dig> is virulent on dictyostelium discoideum 
as described in figure 3a, klebsiella aerogenes  , pseudomonas aeruginosa pa <dig> , and mfn <dig> were tested on d. discoideum. on a layer of ka, about one hundred lysis plaques were observed, corresponding to the zone where actively feeding and replicating d. discoideum have phagocytosed the bacteria. on a layer of pa <dig> or mfn <dig> at 10%, no lysis plaque was detected. mfn <dig> does indeed display a virulent phenotype on d. discoideum, either by evading d. discoideum killing, or by actively killing amoebae. then, our panel of strains was tested on d. discoideum . two strains, c7r <dig> and mf <dig> had a complete absence of d. discoideum growth inhibition . mfy <dig> and sbw <dig> were highly permissive for d. discoideum growth . mfy <dig> and mfy <dig> permitted the replication of about half of the d. discoideum . dc <dig> had a slightly virulent phenotype on d. discoideum . in our panel, to small to be representative, d. discoideum growth inhibition above 50% was only observed for clinical or phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas.

p. fluorescens mfn <dig> virulence towards d. discoideum is dependent on the hrpu-like operon and the gacs/gaca two-component system and is independent of cyclolipopeptides .

we used a mutant strain, mfn <dig>  the hrpu-like operon mutant of mfn <dig>  to determine whether t3ss apparatus proteins are required for the mfn <dig> phenotype with respect to d. discoideum. mfn <dig> was permissive for d. discoideum growth . the revertant of mfn <dig>  mfn <dig>  inhibited d. discoideum growth.

we investigated the possible involvement of the gacs/gaca two-component system in the regulation of this phenotype using a gaca spontaneous mutant of mfn <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> is defective for cyclolipopeptide  production and secreted hemolysis, but still exhibits cha. v <dig> was plated on d. discoideum and allowed these amoebae to grow, as described in figure 3b . introduction of a gaca gene in v <dig>  to give the v1gaca strain, restored wild-type phenotype.

clp biosurfactant production is positively regulated by the gacs/gaca system in numerous p.fluorescens strains  <cit> . biosurfactants produced by p. aeruginosa have been reported to cause the lysis of d. discoideum <cit> . to investigate the role of clp, we took advantage of strain v <dig>  a mfn <dig> variant , which have a defect in clp production but which have a wild type gacs/gaca  <cit> . v <dig> does not show other measurable modifications from secreted factors. v <dig> inhibited fully d. discoideum growth .

d. discoideum growth inhibition could be due to mfn1032-induced death of klebsiella aerogenes, which is the feeding source of the amoeba. to exclude this possibility, we counted klebsiella aerogenes colony forming unit  after  <dig> days at 22°c in sm medium, either with or without the presence of mfn <dig>  mfn <dig> or v <dig>  in all conditions, the klebsiella aerogenes counts were identical .

moreover, as described in figure  <dig> c, mfn <dig> as sole feeding source permitted d. discoideum growth in  <dig> days at 22°c, while mfn <dig> did not. similar results were obtained with v <dig> .

p. fluorescens mfn <dig> is cytotoxic on macrophages via intracellular mechanisms
in order to correlate d. discoideum growth inhibition  and cytotoxicity towards macrophages, we infected cell line j774a. <dig> macrophages with mfn <dig> , dc <dig>  and sbw <dig>  as described in material and methods. the strain of p. aeruginosa cha is a clinical isolate from a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis and has been used as a positive control for macrophage lysis, monitored by ldh release  <cit> . this strain has a highly inducible t3ss, responsible for virulence behaviour  <cit> . this strain provoked full lysis of macrophages in our conditions . mfn <dig> displayed an ldh release of 40% whereas sbw <dig> and dc <dig> were unable to lyse macrophages. these results showed that, in dc <dig>  slight virulence towards d. discoideum is not correlated with macrophage necrosis. 

in order to determine the possible involvement of t3ss in macrophage lysis by mfn <dig>  we used mfn <dig>  to infect j774a. <dig> macrophages. mfn <dig> was impaired in macrophage lysis whereas mfn <dig>  had a wild type phenotype with a 40% ldh release. the gaca mutant of mfn <dig>  v <dig>  had the same range of macrophage lysis as mfn <dig> .

confocal analysis of macrophages infected by mfn <dig> was conducted to study this necrosis. following ten minutes of infection, numerous macrophages appeared red in medium containing etbr, confirming a rapid necrosis . orthographic representation revealed that every dead macrophage contained mfn <dig> expressing green fluorescent protein . only few live macrophages, which were not stained but perceptible by their autofluorescence, contained intracellular bacteria .

mfn <dig>  phenotypes can be partially restored by expression of hrpu-like operon genes from sbw25
mfn <dig> is a mutant containing an insertion that disrupts the hrpu-like operon. this strategy of mutation can cause polar effects, i.e genetic modifications outside the targeted region. thus, the phenotypes observed could be related to genes other than the hrpu-like operon. to check this possibility, the rscstu genes of sbw <dig>  were expressed from plasmid pbbr1mcs- <dig> in mfn <dig>  we choose to clone the rscstu genes of sbw <dig> for complementation experiments because sbw <dig> genome is sequenced  and the rscrst genes present more than 90% of identity with the hrcrst genes of mfn <dig>  the phenotypes of the resulting strain, mfn1030-pbbr-rscstu, are summarised in table  <dig> . d. discoideum growth inhibition and cha were restored in mfn1030-pbbr-rscstu, with levels similar to those characteristic of wild type mfn <dig>  macrophages lysis was partly restored in mfn1030-pbbr-rscstu with a level corresponding to half of that of the wild type. introduction of parental plasmid pbbr1mcs- <dig> in mfn <dig>  did not modify mfn <dig> phenotypes.

discussion
cha seems dependent on strain origin and not only on t3ss basal part homology
all clinical p. fluorescens strains had cha while environmental strains of pseudomonas did not. nevertheless, hrpu-like operons of sbw <dig>  mf <dig>  and mfn <dig> are highly homologous   <cit> . this was confirmed by complementation of mfn <dig> by the sbw <dig> genes. even if hrpu-like operon genes are essential to the cha of mfn <dig>  as demonstrated by mfn <dig> mutant and complementation results, other factors that depend on the origin of the strain, like the t3ss upper part components or the t3ss effectors, are necessary for red blood cell lysis.

in c7r <dig> and sbw <dig> the functionality or mechanism of t3ss are not fully understood. on the contrary, p. syringae dc <dig> has a functional t3ss with hrpz as a translocation protein. in our conditions, t3ss of this phytopathogen was not able to induce cha. this result confirms the inability of hrpz to cause rbc lysis as described by lee  <cit> . moreover, none of the clinical strains induced hr on tobacco leaves, while c7r <dig> did. this suggests that the hrpu-like operons have a function in the hemolytic p. fluorescens clinical strains different from that in the biocontrol and phytopathogenic strains, which are able to induce t3ss mediated hr. these findings are in concordance with those of mavrodi et al. who demonstrated the presence of stable divergent lineages of t3ss in pseudomonas fluorescens strains  <cit> .

p. fluorescens clinical strains inhibit d. discoideum growth
d. discoideum growth inhibition is not a common feature in this species and was rarely found in p. fluorescens environmental strains, even if our panel is too low to be representative. the majority of environmental p. aeruginosa isolates have functional t3sss with toxins that facilitate killing amoebae, their natural predators. their t3sss may have evolved for this purpose and broad conservation of targeted substrates across eukaryotic organisms resulted in a system active against human cells  <cit> . in p. fluorescens, the t3ss distribution is not homogenous. hrpu-like operons were absent from pf0- <dig> and pf <dig> but were present in numerous other rhizospheric strains  <cit> , which leads us to believe that this mechanism of resistance to d. discoideum predation are not essential to p.fluorescens survival. however, the natural niches of p. fluorescens and p. aeruginosa are mainly the same, and bacteria are exposed to the same predation by amoebae. it should be noted that this it is, to our knowledge, the first report of p. fluorescens strains virulence towards amoebae.

d. discoideum growth inhibition by mfn <dig> seems positively controlled by the gacs/gaca system and involves the hrpu-like operon
an interesting result was the loss of mfn <dig> virulence towards d. discoideum in gaca and in hrpu-like operon mutants. involvement of gacs/gaca in growth inhibition of d. discoideum has been reported in a strain of p. entomophila, a soil bacterium with cyclolipopeptide production. p. entomophila gaca mutant is avirulent but clps and t3ss were not involved in virulence  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa full virulence requires t3ss and quorum sensing molecules   <cit> . again, these results underline the similarity of mechanisms with p. aeruginosa, despite the phylogenetic distance between the t3ss basal parts of these two species.

macrophage necrosis required the hrpu-like operon and is independent of the gacs/gaca system
mfn <dig> was able to provoke macrophage lysis in our conditions, but it was only half has effective as the cha strain, a highly pathogenic p. aeruginosa strain. macrophages lysis was not fully restored in the complemented strain, mfn1030-pbbr-rscstu. that could be the consequence of the expression of rscstu genes from a plasmid, under plac promotor control, without their own upstream regulatory sequences. as with the cha strain, necrosis was rapid  for some macrophages. all dead macrophages contained bacteria. we hypothesize that bacterial internalisation by phagocytosis activity is a signal for an induction of virulence factor secretion. this rapid necrosis required hrpu-like operon and was independent of the gacs/gaca two-component system. these dependencies suggest that this mechanism is different from d. discoideum growth inhibition and similar to cha activity. this was confirmed by the results in dc <dig> which was unable to lyse macrophages and partially able to resist d. discoideum predation but lacking in cha. the mechanism of dc <dig> virulence towards d. discoideum is to our knowledge unknown. some literature suggests that this activity could be due to the action of biosurfactants produced by this strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
mfn <dig> is able to induce macrophage and red blood cell lysis and to prevent d. discoideum predation. in these three processes, hrpu-like operon is required but gaca/gacs positive regulation concerns only the d. discoideum model. our findings establish a link between the t3ss and virulence of mfn <dig> against eukaryotic cells. this study also underlines the high heterogeneity of the pseudomonas according to their origin. the hypothesis of virulence acquisition towards human cells by a stochastic evolution of an ancestral mechanism dedicated to natural predator, such as amoebae, cannot explain all our results. we suggest that a major evolution of upper t3ss compounds or t3ss toxins, despite the conservation of the t3ss basal part, could be at the origin of mfn <dig> virulence. this work must be extended to a larger representative panel of pseudomonas fluorescens strains to confirm this hypothesis.
