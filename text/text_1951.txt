BACKGROUND
powdery mildew is a prevalent disease of many higher plant species that is caused by ascomycetes of the order erysiphales  <cit> . members of the order erysiphales have an obligate biotrophic lifestyle, i.e. they can only grow and propagate on living plant tissue; in vitro propagation and genetic manipulation  are currently impossible. while some powdery mildew fungi have a wide host range and can infect a broad spectrum of plant species, others have a narrow host range and can often infect only a single plant species. a well-known representative of the latter is blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei , the causal agent of the barley powdery mildew disease, which exclusively colonizes barley . grass powdery mildews of the genus blumeria are serious phytopathogens that cause considerable yield losses in agricultural settings  <cit> .

we previously sequenced and partially assembled the genomes of the three powdery mildew species bgh , erysiphe pisi  and golovinomyces orontii . recently, the genome sequence of a fourth powdery mildew species , the wheat powdery mildew pathogen), has been published  <cit>  and additional bgh isolates have been sequenced  <cit> . these studies show that in comparison to other ascomycetes, powdery mildew genomes are unusually large . this is chiefly due to a genome structure typified by the presence of numerous nested retrotransposon copies with few interspersed genes. haplotype structure of the bgh and bgt genomes reveals a mosaic pattern of alternating homomorphic and polymorphic blocks, which has been interpreted as an indication of frequent asexual and rare sexual reproduction  <cit> .

despite their huge size, powdery mildew genomes are characterized by a comparatively small number of conventional protein-coding genes. for example, the genomes of bgh and bgt each harbor ~ <dig>  annotated genes  <cit> . this is at the lower end for ascomycete phytopathogens  <cit> . the reduction in gene content is partly due to a drastic decrease in genes coding for cell wall-degrading enzymes  and secondary metabolite biosynthesis enzymes, which is consistent with their parasitic obligate biotrophic lifestyle. in addition, powdery mildews have lost multiple genes that are otherwise conserved in ascomycetes, ranging from unicellular yeasts to filamentous fungi. these genes comprise, amongst others, enzymes required for nitrate and sulfate assimilation and biosynthesis of thiamine   <cit> . interestingly, similar gene losses can also be seen in the genomes of the very distantly related rust fungi  and downy mildews , which also possess obligate biotrophic lifestyles, suggesting that the reduction in gene content represents lifestyle-associated convergent evolution  <cit> .

it can be assumed that the list of common fungal genes found to be missing in bgh is incomplete. first, very strict criteria were applied to identify missing genes in bgh. proteins belonging to different families, but sharing common domains, may thus have escaped detection. second, the starting point for the analysis was the well-annotated proteome of yeast, which is a unicellular fungus. therefore, all proteins that are specific to filamentous fungi were not considered. third, missing family members cannot be identified by this approach. fourth, species-specific gene losses in individual powdery mildew species might well have been overlooked, since absence of the genes in all three powdery mildew species under consideration  was a criterion of the bioinformatic pipeline. we therefore expect that careful manual analysis would uncover additional genes missing in the bgh genome.

as other phytopathogens, powdery mildew fungi are thought to deploy a suite of secreted effector proteins for host cell manipulation. genome-wide analysis revealed  <dig> candidate secreted effector proteins  that are encoded by the bgh genome  <cit> . cseps represent comparatively small polypeptides that harbor a predicted n-terminal signal peptide for secretion, lack sequence-relatedness to known proteins in the ncbi database and often show evidence of diversifying selection  <cit> . notably, a considerable number of the bgh cseps show predicted structural similarities to microbial ribonucleases  <cit> . a similar, though slightly higher, number  of effector-encoding genes was found in bgt
 <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> cseps are shared between bgh and bgt, and appear to represent blumeria-specific genes, since there is no evidence for their existence outside this genus. first functional studies have begun to elucidate the contribution of individual cseps to plant colonization  <cit> . besides the cseps, the bgh genome encodes a huge suite of unconventional effector candidates that lack an amino-terminal secretion signal and are physically associated and seemingly coevolved with line- <dig> retrotransposons  <cit> . these proteins were first recognized upon cloning of the avirulence genes matching the barley mlk <dig> and mla <dig> resistance genes  <cit>  and are therefore also designated putative effectors with similarity to avrk <dig> and avra <dig> .

despite extensive characterization of genomic organization  <cit> , haplotype structure  <cit>  and effector content  <cit>  of the bgh genome, little attention has been paid to its core proteome. here we provide a global characterization of the full bgh proteome and analyze in detail selected protein families with well-known roles in fungal development and pathogenicity.

RESULTS
global characterization of the conceptual bghproteome
the annotated bgh isolate dh <dig> genome  comprises  <dig>  genes, including ca.  <dig> partial genes  and/or genes that are split on two contigs . in the course of this analysis we annotated an additional  <dig> genes, of which one  was not represented by a genomic contig of isolate dh <dig> but deduced from rna sequencing data from bgh isolate k <dig>  <cit> . altogether, this resulted in a total of  <dig>  genes, which form the basis for the present study . we used the respective predicted amino acid sequences to perform a number of bioinformatic analyses to characterize the proteome of bgh dh <dig> 

the size of the predicted bgh proteins is 483 ±  <dig>  amino acids, which is close to the average protein size of  <dig> amino acids recently reported for fungi  <cit> . a major proportion  of the bgh proteins lie between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in size . few proteins are larger than  <dig>  amino acids  or smaller than  <dig> amino acids . according to the current annotation, the smallest protein, with  <dig> amino acids, is the 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> . the largest protein , composed of  <dig>  amino acids, is a homolog of midasin, a huge aaa atpase distantly related to the motor protein dynein.figure  <dig>

proteome. histograms showing the frequency distribution of protein length  and the frequency distribution of transmembrane domains per protein .



tmhmm <dig>  analysis indicated that  <dig>  bgh proteins harbor at least one transmembrane  domain . the range of predicted tm domains per protein is between one  and  <dig> , with few proteins  having more than ten predicted tm domains . similar to this calculation, the extrapolation of experimentally determined subcellular localization data suggests the presence of somewhat more than  <dig>  integral membrane proteins in the unicellular ascomycete saccharomyces cerevisiae
 <cit> . analysis with signalp <dig>  revealed that  <dig> proteins  harbor a predicted signal peptide for secretion at their amino terminus . in absolute numbers this value is at the lower end for signalp-predicted proteins of the fungal subphylum pezizomycotina; however, in relation to the size of the proteome it is rather at the upper end  <cit> . these putatively secreted bgh proteins comprise  <dig> of the  <dig> previously identified cseps. the seeming discrepancy for the remaining  <dig> cseps results from prediction algorithm changes, in the now used signalp <dig>  version, compared to the formerly used version  <dig> . these instances may thus comprise borderline cases for which signal peptide prediction is ambiguous. however, analysis with the signalp <dig>  algorithm corroborated the presence of an n-terminal signal peptide for 86% of the previously identified cseps and allowed the identification of  <dig> additional secreted effector candidates that were differentially classified or overlooked before . in conclusion, this analysis shows that cseps account for more than half of the bgh proteins with a predicted signal peptide.

blastp searches, in the context of blast2go analysis, revealed  <dig>  bgh proteins with one or more hits in the ncbi database , while  <dig> proteins had no significant hits  at the time of analysis. botryotinia fuckeliana, glarea lozoyensis, marssonina brunnea, fusarium oxysporum and sclerotinia sclerotiorum were the species that yielded the greatest total number of blast hits ; whereas marssonina brunnea, glarea lozoyensis and botryotinia fuckeliana were the species that yielded most top blast hits for the bgh query sequences .

we used markov clustering  to group the  <dig>  predicted bgh proteins into polypeptide families . this type of analysis revealed that the bgh genome encodes  <dig> protein families, ranging in size from two to  <dig> members, plus  <dig>  singletons. most protein families are small  or medium-sized , and only seven families comprise more than  <dig> members . eka-like avirulence proteins, six different csep families, kinases, wd <dig> domain proteins, atp-dependent rna helicases, mitochondrial carrier proteins and aaa atpases comprise the protein families with the highest number of members in the bgh proteome . this outcome is largely consistent with the analysis of protein domains by interproscan, which revealed that wd <dig> and kinase domains are amongst the most prevalent domains in bgh proteins . wd <dig> domains exhibit a β-propeller architecture and are amongst the most abundant domains in eukaryotic organisms. they are typically involved in mediating protein-protein or protein-dna interactions  <cit> . notably, seven of the  <dig> largest protein families appear to be, largely, blumeria-specific. these include the eka avirulence proteins and the six largest csep families .table  <dig>

predicted subcellular localization of bghproteins
we performed an analysis of potential subcellular localization for the  <dig>  conceptual bgh proteins using protcomp , which combines several methods for prediction of protein localization . in the context of our study we considered the outcome of “neural network analysis” and the “integral final score”, the latter condensing the results of four different prediction methods into a final mark. both approaches yielded similar prediction profiles , with consistent predictions of subcellular localization for  <dig>  proteins and conflicting predictions for  <dig>  proteins. results of the protcomp analysis further support a secretory pathway route for a subset of the known cseps and additional effector candidates, since  <dig> out of the  <dig> previously published cseps and  <dig> out of the  <dig> additional cseps proposed in the context of this work, were classified as “extracellular ” by both the neural network method and the integral final score .

a family of fungus-specific kinases is expanded in bghand bgt
we noted the drastic expansion of a family of fungus-specific kinases in bgh compared to other fungi . this type of kinases appears to be largely restricted to the fungal clade of leotiomyceta; outside of this taxonomic division only few kinases with low sequence similarity can be found . within the leotiomyceta, the kinases appear to be most prevalent in pathogenic species representing different taxonomic classes, in particular phytopathogens, but also some facultative human and insect pathogens. by contrast, saprophytic fungi seem to either lack these kinases  or only harbor single/few copies thereof . nevertheless, some phytopathogenic fungal species lack these kinases , indicating that their presence is not a strict prerequisite for a pathogenic lifestyle. the presence/absence pattern of these proteins in fungal taxa suggests several independent losses of genes encoding this kinase type within the leotiomyceta, concomitant with a convergent expansion of this gene family in a subset of pathogenic species. this notion is further supported by phylogenetic analysis of this protein family, which in most cases revealed species-/clade-specific grouping rather than paralog-specific clustering of the respective protein sequences . such a phylogenetic pattern is indicative of species-specific expansions of the kinase family subsequent to fungal speciation events.figure  <dig>

according to our sequence similarity database searches, the bgh genome encompasses the highest number of genes encoding this kinase type , while the bgt genome encodes  <dig> members of this protein family . the difference in the size of this kinase family between these two closely related formae speciales is striking and may relate to problems with genome annotation . alternatively, this finding could indicate that the kinase genes evolved differently in bgh and bgt. notably, the genomes of the powdery mildews infecting dicotyledonous plant species, e. pisi and g. orontii, each seem to contain only one member of this kinase type . in bgh, many members of the bgh kinase family reside on comparatively small contigs of the current dh <dig> genome assembly . in most cases these contigs lack other genes . this scenario suggests that these genes are mostly localized/isolated within highly repetitive genomic regions that are difficult to assemble. the full-length sequences of these kinases are typically 500– <dig> amino acids in length. owing to the small size of the corresponding genomic contigs several members are n- and/or c-terminally truncated. thus, the actual number of these kinases might be lower than indicated in additional file 6: table s <dig>  since pairs of n- and c-terminally truncated proteins may represent the same protein.

the predicted kinase domain resides in the carboxy-terminal half of the proteins. twenty-one of the  <dig> bgh paralogs are annotated with interproscan domain ipr <dig> , suggesting that these proteins possess tyrosine kinase activity. however, it is generally thought that fungi lost tyrosine kinases in the course of evolution  <cit>  and that only subgroups of the basidiomycetes encode kinases that are closely related to tyrosine kinases  <cit> . consistent with this belief, virtual structure prediction, via the protein fold recognition server phyre <dig> , revealed highest structural similarity of  <dig> of these kinases to the human serine/threonine kinase vaccinia-related kinase  <dig> . the contradictory in silico predictions prevent, at present, the reliable classification of this kinase family regarding its substrate specificity; however, the lack of additional tyrosine kinase specific sequence motifs  <cit>  rather suggests that these proteins may have no tyrosine kinase activity. apart from the signatures mentioned above, no other known protein domains can be found in these kinases. interestingly, the genome of the obligate biotrophic wheat rust pathogen  encodes a family of kinases, comprised of  <dig> members, with similar protein size. these show distant sequence similarity to the presumptive bgh kinase family  and may represent the basidiomycete equivalent of the ascomycete pathogen-associated kinases. it remains to be seen whether these proteins are active kinases, what their substrates are and whether and how they contribute to pathogenic processes.

bgh- and powdery mildew-specific proteins
we identified  <dig>  bgh proteins without significant ncbi blastp hits  except from hits to other bgh proteins . these include the  <dig> proteins without any considerable blastp hit mentioned above  plus  <dig> eka-like proteins and  <dig> proteins with solely bgh-specific blastp hits. in total, the  <dig>  proteins comprise  <dig> cseps,  <dig> eka-like proteins and otherwise mainly unknown/hypothetical proteins. only  <dig> of the  <dig>  proteins contain an interproscan domain, ipr <dig>  being present 61-times, while all other domains occur only once or twice. this finding is consistent with the previous analysis of bgh cseps, which uncovered unexpected affinities of a subset of this protein group to microbial ribonucleases  <cit> . tblastn analysis reveals that  <dig> of the proteins are also encoded by the e. pisi genome , while  <dig> are encoded by the g. orontii genome  as well. in total,  <dig> proteins, the majority thereof eka proteins but also including twelve cseps, are common to all three powdery mildews and thus seem to represent powdery mildew-specific proteins . on the other hand,  <dig> proteins appear to be blumeria/bgh-specific proteins since recognizable orthologs  are absent in both e. pisi and g. orontii . these  <dig> blumeria/bgh-specific proteins include  <dig> of the previously described  <dig> cseps  <cit> .

proteins conserved in and specific to filamentous fungi
we recently found that the genomes of powdery mildew fungi lack a core set of  <dig> genes that are otherwise conserved in fungal species from yeasts to filamentous fungi  <cit> . these and possibly further missing genes could be the molecular cause for the obligate biotrophic lifestyle of these parasites. we speculated that the actual number of “missing genes” in powdery mildews might be considerably higher, since we applied very strict criteria for the automated blast searches, which would exclude all borderline cases that could for example arise from the presence of similar domains in otherwise unrelated proteins. to obtain a first insight whether this hypothesis was correct, we analyzed the powdery mildew genomes for the presence of  <dig> fungal ortholog mcls that were previously found to be present exclusively in a set of  <dig> analyzed genomes of filamentous fungi, but not in the genomes of seven tested unicellular fungi . of the  <dig> mcls analyzed, eight  were not represented in the bgh genome . thus, the analysis of this diagnostic set of proteins that are otherwise conserved in and specific to filamentous fungi confirms our hypothesis that additional genes have been lost in the powdery mildews.table  <dig>

proteins crucial for the formation of hyphal anastomoses
hyphal anastomoses  are common in filamentous fungi. they are typically formed during colony expansion and contribute to the development of an extensive interconnected mycelium  <cit> . somatic fusion of fungal cells often occurs early during fungal development and involves dedicated conidial anastomosis tubes . formation of anastomoses can take place within a fungal colony and between fungal colonies. in the case of genetically diverse colonies, the latter can result in a heterokaryon, i.e. the presence of genetically different nuclei in a common cytoplasm  <cit> . genetic analysis revealed a few factors that are required for anastomosis formation in the model ascomycete n. crassa
 <cit> . these encode transcription factors, components of signal transduction and proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion  <cit> .

to our knowledge, formation of hyphal anastomoses has never been reported for powdery mildews, suggesting that these ascomycetes are incapable of developing this type of cell-cell connections. to find out whether the apparent inability to generate somatic cell fusions is correlated with the absence of genes known to be required for anastomosis formation, we analyzed the presence/absence of these genes in the powdery mildew genomes. we found that of the  <dig> genes analyzed, two  were absent in the genomes of all three powdery mildew species . by contrast, these two genes were present in the genomes of the closely related fungal species b. fuckeliana and s. sclerotiorum, which are both capable of forming hyphal anastomoses  <cit> . in conclusion, these findings suggest that powdery mildews possibly lack the ability to form hyphal anastomoses owing to a lineage-specific loss of at least two genes coding for proteins that are essential for this process.

analysis of protein families with prominent roles in fungal development, signaling and pathogenesis
to find out whether additional fungal pathways that are known to play important roles in fungal development, signaling and pathogenesis are affected by genes not present in bgh, we conducted manual inspection of a number of key pathways, comprising heterotrimeric g protein signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  signaling, small g protein signaling, calcium signaling and transcription factors .

heterotrimeric g protein signaling
g protein coupled receptors  are heptahelical cell surface receptors that, upon extracellular binding of a cognate ligand, initiate intracellular signal transduction pathways via heterotrimeric g proteins. in fungi, gpcrs sense diverse extracellular signals including: pheromones, carbohydrates, amino acids, nitrogen sources and photons  <cit> . together with the associated downstream heterotrimeric g protein signaling complex they engage in essential functions during growth, asexual and sexual development and virulence in the case of pathogenic fungi. in contrast to mammals, where gpcrs form a large and sequence-diversified family with several hundred members per species  <cit> , most fungal genomes encode few gpcr proteins  and a limited set of heterotrimeric g protein components  not found in other fungal groups. this type of gpcr is present as an expanded family of  <dig> members in the phytopathogen m. grisea
 <cit> . regulator of g protein signaling  proteins control the activity of gα subunits  <cit> , while phosducin proteins regulate gβγ subunits, possibly by serving as chaperones  <cit> . therefore these two types of proteins represent important rheostats of g protein signaling pathways.

we mined the bgh genome for the presence of genes coding for heterotrimeric g protein subunits, gpcrs, rgs and phosducin proteins. we identified the archetypal set of heterotrimeric g protein components , gpcrs  and as well as five rgs and two phosducin proteins . we identified one additional bgh gene  that encodes a protein harboring interproscan domain ipr <dig> . this domain is characteristic of gβ subunits; however, it still remains to be seen whether the respective protein, which is also encoded in the genomes of many other ascomycetes, has an authentic role in heterotrimeric g protein signaling. while three of the five predicted rgs proteins are well-conserved in other fungi , the other two  show limited sequence conservation and thus represent less common or less preserved types of rgs. the domain architecture of ccu <dig> resembles human rgs-px <dig>  a presumably bifunctional protein in which the rgs domain is associated with sorting nexin features, thereby possibly linking g protein regulation to vesicular trafficking  <cit> . the genomes of many ascomycetes and higher plants encode a protein representing a presumed translational fusion of a gpcr with an rgs protein . such a gene is absent in bgh, but also missing in the genomes of b. cinerea and s. sclerotiorum, suggesting that this gene might have been lost in the lineage of the leotiomycetes. besides the eight canonical gpcrs, we found five additional high confidence gpcr candidate gene products based on the presence of characteristic interproscan domains . moreover, we identified twelve genes encoding proteins that, according to their predicted transmembrane topology and lack of homology to characterized proteins, may also represent gpcrs . either way, the number of gpcrs in bgh seems to be considerably smaller than the extended gpcr complement found in the hemibiotrophic phytopathogen m. grisea
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

mapk signaling
mitogen activated kinases  are highly conserved eukaryotic protein kinases. they typically function in modules of three-tiered signaling cascades, in which mapks are phosphorylated and activated by mapk-kinases , which in turn are phosphorylated and activated by mapkk-kinases . mapkkks are connected to cell surface sensors via small monomeric gtpases and/or other upstream protein kinases. mapk signaling is required for appressorium formation in several phytopathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi . analysis of the bgh proteome revealed the presence of four canonical mapkkks , three prototypical mapkks  and three archetypal mapks . these proteins harbor characteristic kinase domains , and comprise presumptive orthologs of key mapks that are known to have important roles in fungal signaling and development . in addition to these classical mapks, the presence of distinctive protein domains suggests five additional mapkkks and three further mapks in bgh. however, some of these proteins appear to be kinases acting upstream of mapk modules  or kinases that have sequence similarity to mapkkks/mapks, but may not necessarily exert this function.figure  <dig> 
predicted mapk signaling cascades in
bgh
. the scheme illustrates tentative mapk signaling modules on the basis of known yeast mapk cascades  <cit> . for further details, see additional file 7: table s <dig> .



based on the compilation of  <cit> , we also studied the presence/absence of genes that encode proteins known to act upstream or downstream of mapk signaling. all signaling components typically present in filamentous fungi were found to be present. these include some known upstream kinases  and downstream transcription factors . thus, the canonical mapk signaling pathways as found in yeast appear to be complete in bgh . the additionally identified mapkkk and mapk candidates leave, however, room for combinatorial modifications of the existing cascades or novel types of mapk modules.

two of the three canonical bgh mapks identified by our genome-wide search  have been previously described and analyzed  <cit> . another experimental study revealed a rapid transient increase in mapk activity during early development of bgh sporelings  on cellulose membrane. in addition, exogenous application of activators of mapk signaling  promoted fungal development on this artificial surface, while a mapk inhibitor  had the opposite effect  <cit> . thus, similar to other phytopathogens  <cit> , mapk signaling in bgh appears to play a role in the differentiation of key infection structures.

camp signaling
the camp pathway is a highly conserved central node of fungal development and virulence. it is responsive to nutrient and oxidative stress and regulates growth, cell cycle and pathogenesis in fungi . the pathway is essentially comprised of adenylate cyclase, which forms cyclic amp  from atp and is activated by stress-responsive upstream components, and protein kinase a , which acts as a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic subunits and two camp-binding regulatory subunits. pka activates, in turn, transcriptional regulators that control expression of stress-responsive and cell cycle-associated genes . in our analysis we found that bgh possesses all components involved in camp signaling, i.e. adenylate cyclase , an adenylate cyclase-associated protein , three types of catalytic pka subunits  and one regulatory pka subunit , as well as two cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases , which convert camp back to its non-cyclic form. additionally, genes encoding several known downstream targets of pka, such as ste12/stea , sfl <dig>  and rim101/pac <dig>  are also represented in the bgh genome. accordingly, the camp pathway seems to be complete in bgh .figure  <dig>

the findings from our in silico genomic analysis are consistent with previous experimental studies, which support a role for camp signaling in bgh pathogenesis. for example, a rise in bgh camp levels correlates with conidial differentiation on the host surface, while camp levels remain unaltered on a non-inductive glass surface  <cit> . moreover, exogenous application of camp analogs and pharmacological stimulation and inhibition of pka further support a role for camp signaling in conidial differentiation and appressorial development in bgh
 <cit> .

small monomeric gtpase signaling
members of the small monomeric gtpase superfamily play crucial roles in many cellular processes, including: signaling, endomembrane trafficking, cell cycle regulation and protein transport through the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . in bgh, we found  <dig> small gtpases, belonging to the canonical ras-, ras-like-, rab-, ran-, and rho-families, and  <dig> arf-type gtpases . none of the families shows abnormalities concerning number of members or presence/absence of essential small gtpases. furthermore, three mitochondrial small gtpases were found in the bgh genome. two of these belong to the ras superfamily, whereas the other one corresponds to the rho-type gtpase miro1/ <dig> , a calcium-dependent mitochondrial gtpase ubiquitously present in eukaryotes  <cit> . as described for gem1p, bgh miro1/ <dig> harbors two predicted gtpase domains and ef-hand like calcium binding domains. numerous genes coding for corresponding gtpase activating proteins  and guanine nucleotide exchange factors  are present in the bgh genome. bgh possesses  <dig> gaps and  <dig> arfgaps, the latter being involved in vesicle fusion and fission,  <dig> gefs, and  <dig> arfgefs . taken together, all canonical small gtpase families are represented in the bgh genome.

calcium signaling
the secondary messenger calcium  is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes in eukaryotes. in filamentous fungi, ca2+--mediated signal transduction is linked to responses to environmental stress as well as the regulation of fungal development including: spore germination, appressorium formation, polar growth, hyphal branching and sporulation . the perception of extracellular signals results in a transient increase in the cellular concentration of free ca2+, often mediated via activation of phospholipase c  by gpcrs. plc subsequently hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid pip <dig> to form ip <dig> and diacylglycerol , two secondary messengers that initiate ca2+ fluxes from the er, vacuole and extracellular space. the resulting increase of cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration is a prerequisite for activation of a number of diverse downstream signaling components for example kinases, including protein kinase c , ca2+/calmodulin and -dependent kinases . the tight regulation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration requires the activity of several cellular components .figure  <dig>

in resting eukaryotic cells, the intracellular ca2+ concentration is maintained at a remarkably low level and increases upon extracellular cues due to the activity of ca2+ pumps and transporters located in the plasma membrane , er membrane or the tonoplast  <cit> . in bgh we found putative homologs for most proteins known or predicted to be involved in transmembrane ca2+ transport, including: ca2+ channels , atpases  and na2+/ca2+ exchangers  . however, no obvious homolog could be identified for the plasma membrane-resident yeast ca2+ p-type atpase ena <dig>  which is conserved in n. crassa and m. oryzae and in the latter critical for appressorium formation  <cit> . on the other hand, an additional putative ca2+ atpase not present in yeast was identified . this protein is related to the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic ca2+p-type atpases iia of the serca type, which is conserved in m. oryzae and n. crassa and involved in virulence of the human pathogenic basidiomycete cryptococcus neoformans
 <cit> . ca2+ ion fluxes from the environment or intracellular organelles precede the binding of ca2+ to calmodulin , which transduces ca2+ signatures by ca2+-mediated interactions with various target proteins. cam is present in all eukaryotes and usually highly conserved. interestingly, we found a relatively low degree of cam conservation between yeast and bgh . the best blast hit for bgh cam  is found in metarhizium robertsii, an entomopathogenic, insect-infecting ascomycete .

subsequently, cam interacts with and activates a variety of downstream acting proteins including calcineurin , a protein phosphatase that controls morphogenesis and stress responses in eukaryotes. fungal pathogens have adopted the calcineurin pathway to survive and effectively propagate within the host . calcineurin is formed by a heterodimer of a catalytic subunit  and a regulatory subunit  and is further regulated by calcipressin , which in yeast is represented by the calcipressin- <dig> rcn1p that is not conserved in bgh. however, blast searches with mammalian cp- <dig> and cp- <dig> family members as query identified the bgh protein ccu <dig> as a possible candidate for calcipressin, albeit with low amino acid identity . in accordance with this finding, interproscan predicts the calcipressin motif ipr <dig> for the bgh protein. in yeast, active calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor crz <dig>  which subsequently enters the nucleus  <cit> . nuclear crz <dig> binds to calcineurin-dependent response elements  and activates its own transcription as well as target genes linked to cell wall synthesis and ca2+ homeostasis including: pmr <dig>  pmc <dig>  cch <dig>  ena <dig>  <cit> .

transcription factors  are essential components in signal transduction, linking signal flow to transcriptional output. they are thus crucial mediators in fungal development and pathogenesis. fungi contain dozens of tf families, including some seemingly fungus-specific types of tf families  <cit> . we inspected the meta-analysis data of tfs provided by the fungal transcription factor database  and compared the results of the semi-automated classification provided in this database to respective data sets from the closely related species b. cinerea and s. sclerotiorum. according to this analysis, which is based on  <dig>  open reading frames, the bgh genome encodes  <dig> tfs that can be classified into  <dig> families, representing ca.  <dig> % of the bgh orfs . these numbers compare to  <dig> tfs  in b. cinerea and  <dig> tfs  in s. sclerotiorum, respectively. the overall average for the ratio of transcription factors to all orfs for fungi in the ftfd database is  <dig> % , indicating that the relative number of tfs in bgh is in the common range . although the ftfd database indicates that some tf families might be absent in bgh , manual inspection revealed that members of most of these families are in fact encoded by the bgh genome and were possibly excluded or ignored by the automated ftfd classification pipeline. exceptions are the negative transcriptional regulators - a class of tfs that seems indeed to be absent in bgh. the prototype of this family is nmra, a negative transcriptional regulator involved in metabolite  repression in various fungi, including n. crassa and a. nidulans
 <cit> . since bgh, as a highly host-adapted obligate biotrophic pathogen, does not rely on alternative nitrogen sources, such regulatory circuits might be dispensable.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reports basic characteristics of the bgh genome . apart from the largest protein families, which revealed bgh-specific attributes , most features are comparable to other fungal genomes. however, consistent with our hypothesis that the list of missing genes in bgh might be incomplete, our analysis uncovered a number of protein coding genes lacking in bgh compared to other  fungi. these include: proteins, specific to filamentous fungi , which are required for anastomosis formation, negative transcriptional regulators and individual components in common signaling pathways. by contrast, all main components of major signal transduction pathways  are present, suggesting that these pathways are functional in bgh . we identified a set of powdery mildew- and bgh-specific genes and found that a family of pathogenesis-related kinases with unknown kinase specificity is unusually expanded in bgh . the functional relevance of these kinases for the bgh life cycle remains to be discovered.
