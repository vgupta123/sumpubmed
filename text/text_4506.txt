BACKGROUND
the dna sequence has no landmarks to guide the search for transcription factor binding sites: these binding sites may be near the transcription start site but may also be far from it  <cit> . many papers have examined how these sites might be found computationally  <cit> . some methods use a comparison between orthologous regions of different species  <cit> , often treating the problem as one of multiple alignment  <cit> . other algorithms use a collection of subsequences containing a binding site  to deduce the form or motif of the binding site which is then used to identify sites in other sequences  — reviews of these methods are given in  <cit> . these methods include weeder  <cit> , meme  <cit> , ann-spec  <cit> , morph  <cit>  and glam  <cit> . some authors have proposed a statistical test to decide whether a region of dna is a regulatory region: two methods  <cit>  tested on fly data have been motivated by the hypothesis that the local region around the binding site should be similar to the motif itself. interestingly, such a tendency would not explain the results of this paper. a distantly related line of research is the modeling of nucleosome positions with the expectation that transcription factor binding sites avoid these positions  <cit> . a number of projects have combined data of several types to predict binding sites: for example  <cit> .

the motif-finding methods give the immediate context for the current work. these methods commonly find a large number of false positive binding sites in new sequences  <cit> . as well as a model for the binding site, these methods need a model of the non-binding sequence. the complexity of this model ranges from using single nucleotide frequencies , to modeling the background as a number of states  <cit> . using a hidden markov model, that study found that a useful level of complexity was four states with the probability of a base at a given position depending on the state and the previous base. it is convenient to refer to these states as "mosaic classes" because they are short  — about 50- <dig> bases long. however, the emphasis has been on using no more complexity than is needed to assist the motif finding: there appears to have been little work to find the best model for the bulk dna and this paper addresses this problem. it is plausible that such an analysis will be useful because much of the genome gets its character from local evolutionary processes  <cit>  which would be well modeled by these kinds of classes. short repetitive elements would also be well described.

in this paper, we draw a distinction between occurrences of motifs in the dna sequence which are sites where a transcription factor might bind , and binding sites where factors are experimentally found to bind in vivo. there is also the difference between binding sites and the subset which are proven to affect transcription  <cit> , but this point is not considered in this paper.

we find that the dna sequence may be described in terms of short subsequences: each subsequence belonging to one of  <dig> states, or mosaic classes, each with its own distribution of base frequencies. these classes come in pairs because of the equivalence between the strands. for a set of seventeen transcription factors from different families of factors, 75% of actual binding sites are in the same set of four pairs of preferred classes which account for only 26% of the bases of the genome. however, only 31% of the motifs for these factors are in the same classes. this tendency is observed for all seventeen transcription factors. these results are not a consequence of the different base composition near transcription start sites.

RESULTS
classes found
by analysing sequences taken at random from the whole human genome, we find the pairs of mosaic classes described in table  <dig>  the parameters of the mathematical model describing these classes are given in additional file  <dig>  the classes are generally short in the range  <dig> to  <dig> bases, but one pair  has an average length of over  <dig> bases. as one would expect most classes are poor in cpg doublets, but one pair  has a cpg doublet proportion of 10%.

each row refers to two classes, which we refer to as the a and b classes, each with the reverse complement properties of the other. the a class is the one with the higher percentage of t+c, and the base frequencies for this class are shown in columns 2-3-4- <dig>  the frequencies for the b class are the same but with the a/t and c/g frequencies interchanged. column  <dig> gives the mean length of the class in bases and column  <dig> gives the proportion of doublets within the class that are cpg: these two quantities are the same for both the a and b classes. column  <dig> gives the proportion of bases in the genome within both classes of the class pair: the total of column  <dig> is therefore  <dig> . the class pairs have been numbered by the proportion of bases they contain. all values have been calculated from the fitted hmm: the parameters of this model are given in additional file  <dig> 

to visualise the mosaic classes, we have plotted them by their a, c, g, t content. to do this we have used the variables t+a, t+c, t+g  —  see figure  <dig>  these variables have been used because the a, c, g, t proportions form a three dimensional space , which is most naturally interpreted as a tetrahedron. plotting the space using any two of these variables gives an undistorted view of the tetrahedron with the four corners of the tetrahedron at the four corners of the plot. these variables also maintain the symmetry between the bases as the variables t+a, t+c, t+g are one minus the remaining three pairs of variables c+g, a+g, a+c.

it would be possible to use sequences from a defined subset of the human genome to derive the mosaic classes, and such an analysis might give different results. interesting possibilities include promoter regions, transcribed regions, non-transcribed regions and the genome masked of transposons and/or repetitive elements. using the whole genome has the advantage of simplicity and ensures that nothing has been left out: it is the obvious baseline analysis and is justified by the results we obtain. whether a different subset of the genome gives a more biologically relevant set of classes is a matter for research.

symmetries
dna has two strands which are chemically indistinguishable, with the structure found by watson and crick of as paired to ts and cs to gs. when the base frequencies of a class are counted, it is necessary to choose one of the strands arbitrarily for the measurement. to discuss the effect of this symmetry, consider a hypothetical class, , in which 40% of the bases are a, 20% are c, 20% g, and 20% t. there are logically two contradictory possibilities: a) such a class as h cannot exist — exact strand symmetry applies everywhere including within a class, so that in a class there will be the same number of as as ts and cs as gs. this would imply strong constraints on the base frequencies of any class. b) when the genome is examined — with the strands being equally likely to be used as the measurement strand — it will appear that there is another class k whose characteristics are the reverse complement of h, that is 40% t, 20% g, 20% c, 20% a. we find from our analyses that statement a) is false: if it were true, then the classes found would occur on the line of symmetry t+c = 50% in figure 1a. this result is not unexpected because there is a literature  <cit>  on a-t and c-g strand symmetry, which suggests that both on the small scale  <cit>  and the large scale  <cit>  there may a preferred strand.

it is possible for a large scale feature of the genome to be used to break the symmetry between the strands by defining one strand as the measurement strand — for example, in dna replication one of the strands is the leading strand. however, we expect that classes will still be found in symmetric pairs, even if some class-pairs have a preferential orientation with respect to the defined strand. this remark is based on early analyses concerning transcription — details not shown.

in figure  <dig>  there are hints of other approximate symmetries, .

transcription factor binding sites
as explained in the methods section, we found the exact position of a set of experimentally verified transcription factor binding sites  and ran our model to discover which mosaic classes contained these sites. detailed results will be presented for seventeen transcription factors and the average for these tfs is shown in figure 2a. four pairs of classes contain most of the binding sites:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we will refer to these classes as the "preferred classes" and they are shown in red in the figures. table  <dig> shows the proportion of sites in these classes for these transcription factors. the balance between the four pairs of classes varies with the factor and there may be a preferred orientation/choice of strand as may be seen from the example results for znf <dig> and srf shown in figures 2b and 2c. this tendency for binding sites to occur in these classes applies to every transcription factor — the lowest proportion of sites is 48% which is still nearly twice the proportion expected from the number of bases in these classes.

1) for encode data, this column gives the track, cell line and a possible note on the experimental protocol. for the haib data replication  <dig> was used. 2) name of factor. 3) this column shows, p, the proportion of sequences for which mast found a binding site. 4) the number sites found by mast: later columns show the proportion of these sites in the class pair specified. 5) the values quoted are the average probabilities of the site being in the class; they are not maximum likelihood estimates. 6) total of preceding columns. 7) three lines of comparative figures are given. the line "genome proportions" gives the result of applying the analysis to  <dig> thousand bases chosen at random from the genome: the line "model proportions" gives those of the long term average of the hmm: the line "promoter region" gives the proportions found from applying the model to the bases within  <dig> bases upstream of the transcription start site of all coding genes. the equality of "genome proportions" and "model proportions" is a cross check on the consistency of the calculations.

we ensured that in finding the positions of the binding sites we used the same motifs that had been previously reported. logos for these motifs and cross references to previous work are given in additional file  <dig>  in the handful of cases where the known motif was not found the results were discarded.

we had little choice for which tf to use for a tf family and for which cell line to use for a tf, and where there is a choice, it is usually immaterial. this is shown in table  <dig>  which gives a table of encode experiments for those tfs for which we have results. for consistency, the cell line k <dig> has been used where possible for the detailed analyses.  only for the ap <dig> family is there a real choice, where the c-fos result for gm <dig> is an outlier from all the other results: here we have used the dataset  that gave 60%.

this table summarises the encode data for those transcription factors for which we found a motif from the meme analysis and for which we had permission to use at the time of writing: it includes the jund-gm <dig> result which is anomalously low. other experimental treatments for cjun-k <dig> gave ia <dig> =  <dig> , ig <dig> =  <dig> , ig <dig> =  <dig> . for stat <dig>  the treatments were k562-ia <dig> and hela-ig <dig> 

we have also calculated the proportions of classes for bases for the whole length of the subsequences in the data. given that this data is supposed to be enriched with tfbss, , it would be a corollary of our results that these sequences would be enriched with the preferred classes. in fact, the proportion of bases in the preferred classes in these subsequences is very similar to that for the binding sites, . if it could have been assumed that binding sites were in typical positions on the subsequence, then this result implies that the main thrust of our results could have been deduced without knowing the exact position of the binding site within the subsequence.

the experimental procedure is to break the dna near to and on each side of the tf binding site to give fragments that are a few hundred bases long. the subsequence finally reported as containing the binding site is defined by the position of the two ends estimated from the distribution of the genomic positions of the fragment ends. the neutral baseline sample of breakpoints, where a particular tf is not being "pulled down", is variously called the input signal or control library. the nature of the bias inherent in a control library has been discussed by  <cit> , which observes biases from the copy number and from different kinds of repeat regions being under or over represented, but the most important bias they report is an enhancement near the transcription start site , especially for highly expressed genes. this later point is confirmed by  <cit>  also make the point that the cell line may affect the bias in the control library. the reader might ask if any of these biases have affected our results.

a number of general arguments indicate that our results are not affected by experimental bias. for  <dig> of the tfs analysed the experimental protocol included direct control for these biases  <cit>  and the other experiments, that is for ctcf, sp <dig> and p <dig>  also included their own checking procedures  <cit> . if there is any remaining bias in these experiments, it must be well behaved because the protocol produces uncontroversial motifs, as noted above. although control libraries have a bias towards the tss, as we discuss later, most of our binding sites are in fact far from the tss, so that this aspect of the control bias is not represented in our final results. there is some evidence concerning tfbss: dnasei hypersensitive sites are usually taken to be indicative of regions containing a tfbs and reference  <cit>  finds that there is a moderate enhancement for dnasei hypersensitive sites near tsss, but there is very little enhancement for distant sites. we also note that the binding site tends to be at the middle of the reported subsequence, figure 4: that is away from any end effect which might be associated with the breakpoint itself. there is some complexity, because auerbach et al.  <cit>  suggest that protein binding in a region makes it more likely for that region to be enhanced in a control library and this would imply that tfbss are more likely to occur in regions of higher tag density in the control library: and we have observed such a bias in the data — details not shown. however, we are confident that our results are true because of the following analysis. there are many tfbss in regions where the tag density in the control library is low and we have analysed the mosaic classes of these tfbss. in the data, the tag density is given in integral values and we have found the median value m of  <dig> k bases chosen at random : we then found the subset of tfbss for which the tag density in the control library at the binding site was zero or strictly less than m. the results for the tfs in the cell lines k562/k56b from the yale track show that the bss from low tag density regions in the control data have the same character as the other bss — see table  <dig> 

column  <dig> gives the number of sites and column  <dig> the proportion of tfbss in the preferred classes for all tfbs . columns  <dig> and  <dig> give this information for regions of low tag density in the control library, "sparse regions". column  <dig> gives the proportion of sites in these regions. note that the final column is very close to the preceding column and that often a substantial fraction of tfbss are in "sparse regions". we conclude that the final results are not affected by experimental bias reflected in the control library. this analysis has been done for the "yale" experiments using cell lines k <dig> and k562b. for k <dig>  "sparse regions' were defined as a tag density of  <dig> or  <dig> in the input signal, and for k562b as a tag density of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> 

to see if our results depend on the cell line, we have divided the encode experiments into three groups: gm <dig>  k <dig> and "other". many of the results are for k <dig>  which appears to be a favourite cell line for this experiment. k <dig> is derived from cancerous cells, and it is plausible that this might affect the results. the other lines are also derived from cancer cells except for gm <dig> which has therefore been examined separately. using a representative tf for each tf family, we calculated the mean proportion of sites in the preferred classes in each group of cell lines — see table  <dig>  table  <dig> also shows the lower 95% confidence limit for a one tailed t-test. we conclude that each of these three groups of cell lines gives the same result and that our conclusions do not rely on any one cell line.

this table gives a comparison between cell lines using a representative transcription factor for each family from table  <dig>  the last row gives the lower 95% confidence limit for the mean of the values in the column based on a one-sided t-test. the calculation includes the anomalously low value for jund. we conclude that the choice of cell line does not affect the conclusion that tfbss mainly occur in the preferred classes.

we now discuss if our results have a simple biological explanation. most binding sites are far from the tss: see  <cit>  which reports only 22% of actual binding sites being within  <dig> kb of the tss: compare the figure given by  <cit>  of  <dig> % of dnasei hypersensitive sites as being further than  <dig> bases from a tss. for the tfs analysed in the current datasets, the proportion of actual binding sites further than  <dig> bases from the tss varies from tf to tf, but a typical figure is 80% to 90%, . it is therefore not possible to explain our results by arguing that the proportions of classes found for binding sites reflect the proportions of classes in promoter regions. sites far from the tss  show the same tendency as all sites to occur in the preferred classes . for sites close to the tss, an even higher proportion of sites, 87%, are in the preferred classes, but this result comes from the predominance of pair  <dig>  which has a high proportion of cpg doublets . there are, however, some points of similarity between the proportion of sites in the preferred classes and the proportion of bases in promoter regions — see figure 2d — and we speculate that this could arise because promoter regions must be suitable for tfbss.

note 8) column  <dig> gives the proportion, q, of sites that are more than  <dig> bases from a transcription start site, and column  <dig> gives the number of these sites. other notes are as for table  <dig> 

note 8) column  <dig> gives the proportion, q, of sites that are less than  <dig> bases from a transcription start site, and column  <dig> gives the number of these sites. other notes are as for table  <dig> 

another trivial explanation of our results might be that subsequences are generated at random within each class and the preferred classes shown in table  <dig> are merely those classes which are most likely to generate the motif of the factor. this explanation is not likely to work for as many as seventeen factors, but this possibility has been tested as follows. for each transcription factor we used the motif found by meme in finding the exact binding site positions, and counted the number of occurrences of this motif in artificial sequences representative of each class — see the methods section for details. the proportion of occurrences of motifs in each class is not a useful predictor of the proportion of sites in each class, neither for individual classes , nor for the total in the preferred classes . more detailed results are given in table  <dig> 

this table gives the proportion of motifs in the class pair for each transcription factor: the value has been derived from artificial sequences and adjusted for the relative proportion of bases in each class in the human genome. this table is to be compared with table  <dig> which gives the distribution of actual binding sites.

using the data plotted in figure  <dig>  we find the following statements to be statistically significant. the proportion of sites in the preferred classes is greater than the proportion of bases in the genome: a one-sided t-test gives n =  <dig>  df =  <dig>  t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> e- <dig>  and the 95% lower confidence limit of average proportion of sites =  <dig>  . the difference between the proportion of sites and the proportion of motifs in these classes is greater than zero: a one-sided t-test gives n =  <dig>  df =  <dig>  t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> e- <dig>  and the 95% lower confidence limit of average difference =  <dig> . on the other hand, a comparison between the proportion of motifs and the proportion of bases has a much higher p-value:- a one-sided t-test gives n =  <dig>  df =  <dig>  t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , and the 95% lower confidence limit of average proportion of motifs =  <dig>  . a prior shapiro-wilk test did not show any departure from normality for the samples: the sample of site proportions gave p =  <dig>  and for the motif proportions p =  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we find that the preferred mosaic classes contain 75% of experimentally verified binding sites for transcription factors from seventeen families of transcription factors. the same mosaic classes constitute 26% of the genome and contain only 31% of the motifs for these factors. these results are shown in figure  <dig>  this method of analysis will help with the problem of false positive binding sites found by computational methods. these results must mirror the biological and physical processes involved and imply a profound difference between the mosaic classes.

recent research shows that biologically effective binding sites have a range of binding affinities which lead to a corresponding range of gene expression levels  <cit> . it would be interesting to see if the mosaic class which contains a transcription factor binding site also affects the expression level.

another area for research would be to repeat the analysis for a defined subset of the genome to see if a different set of mosaic classes emerged. one interesting result would be if some parts of the genome showed mosaic classes preserved from an earlier stage of evolution — for example before cpg doublets degraded to cpa doublets. it would also be instructive to perform similar analyses using a large scale biological feature to identify a preferred strand. we have done some exploratory work on the approximate symmetries shown in figure  <dig>  and we think there is more to be said on this subject.
