BACKGROUND
cutaneous leishmaniasis due to l. major is found throughout the old world, including the middle east and west africa. phlebotomus papatasi is the principal vector for this parasite and is refractory to the development of other species of leishmania.

upon taking a blood meal, hematophagous arthropods express a large number of molecules that participate in various physiologic processes ranging from blood digestion to egg development. furthermore, many insects can either obtain or transmit pathogens during the acquisition of a blood meal. in blood-feeding arthropods, the midgut plays a crucial role as the primary organ involved in processing the blood meal and, in some instances, molecules expressed in the midgut of an insect vector have been shown to directly influence pathogen establishment  <cit> . certain pathogens, such as leishmania, appear able to modulate the activity of sandfly midgut proteases for their own benefit or survival  <cit> .

sequenced data sets containing information regarding expression profiles of anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, such as anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti, following a blood meal have become available  <cit> . other datasets now encompass insects such as pedicullus humanus  <cit>  and cullicoides sonorensis  <cit> . in comparison, transcriptome information regarding sandflies is limited. previous work has focused mainly on the sandfly salivary gland  <cit> , whereas only a small number of sandfly-specific midgut cdna have been identified  <cit> . recently, a large set of cdna transcripts from the whole sandfly lutzomyia longipalpis has been sequenced, providing greater information regarding molecules present in sandflies  <cit> . however, the information regarding sandfly midgut-specific transcripts remains poor.

in this work, we embarked on a comprehensive study of p. papatasi midgut-specific transcripts and compared the expression profile of these transcripts by directly comparing those obtained from midguts of females fed on sugar only, on blood or on blood containing l. major. with this approach, we have identified several p. papatasi midgut-specific transcripts that are differentially expressed after a blood meal and in the presence of l. major.

RESULTS
the midgut is the tissue where leishmania development takes place while within its sand fly vector. within the midgut environment, leishmania possibly interacts with various secreted molecules and cell types lining the midgut epithelia. in order to gain greater insight into the repertoire of the proteins present in the midgut of p. papatasi, we constructed and sequenced three high quality full-length cdna libraries from the midgut of sandflies fed either on sugar only , blood or blood containing l. major.  <dig> high quality sequenced clones obtained from the three cdna libraries were combined and analysed resulting in the formation of  <dig> clusters. each cluster may contain a large number of transcripts which creates a contig  or may have a single transcript that can be defined as a singleton. therefore, we will utilise the nomenclature of "cluster" in the remainder of the manuscript to define either a consensus sequence from various transcripts or a singleton.

consensus sequences were compared with various databases and putative functions were assigned. the categories for the transcripts' potential biologic functions included protein synthesis machinery, protein modification machinery, transcription machinery, transporters, extracellular matrix, signal transduction, immunity, adhesion, and conserved proteins of unknown function. table  <dig> summarizes this analysis listing transcripts from female p. papatasi midguts fed on sugar, on blood, and on blood containing l. major. the first column shows the putative biological function, the first section of columns shows the number of clusters found in each of the three cdna libraries in relation to this function; the second section of columns indicates the total number of sequences for these clusters and the third section of columns shows the average of the number of sequences per cluster. the category of "conserved unknown function" had the largest number of clusters in all three of the cdna libraries. these were followed by metabolism, energy in the sugar-fed library ; metabolism, amino acid, which includes digestive enzymes, in the blood meal library ; and protein synthesis machinery in the l. major blood-meal library . the categories with the highest number of sequences per cluster differed between the three cdna libraries and was highest among transcripts identified as extracellular matrix  in the sugar-fed cdna library and cytoskeletal transcripts for both the blood meal  and l. major blood meal cdna libraries . the sugar-fed cdna library has  <dig> clusters with an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. the cdna library constructed from blood-fed midguts consisted of  <dig> clusters with an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. of p. papatasi midgut fed on blood containing l. major, this library produced  <dig> clusters with an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster.

the number of sequences in each category for the three cdna libraries is graphically represented in figure  <dig>  after blood feeding, there is a decrease in the number of sequences in all categories other than cytoskeletal, amino acid metabolism, and heme metabolism. noticeable differences in the number of sequences between the blood-fed and blood-fed containing l. major libraries occurs in the protein synthesis machinery, extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, heme metabolism, and conserved of unknown function categories.

microvilli-associated like proteins
of the most abundant transcripts found in the combined analysis of all three libraries were transcripts coding for proteins with similarities to microvilli membrane proteins from a. aegypti and a. gambiae. these transcripts are also homologous to major allergens identified in the cockroaches blatella germanica and periplaneta americana  <cit>  and to a nitrile-specifier protein  from the midgut of pieris rapae. prnsp has a role of converting toxic compounds, such as isothiocyanate, into less toxic compounds, such as nitriles, that are excreted in the feces of larval stages of this lepidopteran  <cit> . four different putative microvilli-associated proteins were identified in the three p. papatasi midgut cdna libraries . clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> represent likely polymorphisms of the same transcript named here "microvilli protein 1" , which has a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. another three transcripts coding for microvilli proteins and derived from clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were named ppmvp <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  and ppmvp <dig>  respectively. the predicted molecular weight for these microvilli-associated like proteins is  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kda, respectively. additionally, each of these microvilli proteins has a potential signal peptide as predicted by signalp  <dig>  and no evidence of transmembrane helices as predicted using the tmhmm  <dig>  server. identity between the amino acid sequences of these microvilli proteins ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> percent  and similarity from  <dig> to  <dig> percent . the degree of conservation may indicate that these are biochemically distinct from one another and only commonly named based on the previous annotation of other organisms with similar sequences. searching the translated assembled sequences from an est database of l. longipalpis identified nsfm-139c <dig>  nsfm-18h <dig>  nsfm-68e <dig>  and nsfm-47h <dig> as having high sequence homology to the microvilli-associated like proteins ppmvp <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  and ppmvp <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

peritrophin-like proteins
transcripts coding for three different putative peritrophin-like molecules were identified in the midgut of p. papatasi. ppper <dig>  and ppper <dig>  transcripts code for secreted proteins with predicted molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. ppper <dig> is comprised of four potential chitin-binding peritrophin-a domains . ppper <dig> is a much smaller predicted protein and has only one potential chitin-binding domain . a third putative peritrophin, ppper <dig>  was identified from cluster  <dig> with an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda  and contains two distant putative chitin-binding domains. phylogenetic analysis using the chitin binding domains of ppper <dig>  pper <dig>  ppper <dig> and those of peritrophins from several insects  suggests a low level of conservation between the domains. insect peritrophins have been reported to bind to chitin fibers via multiple chitin-binding domains, forming the scaffold that maintains the molecular structure of the peritrophic matrix  in the insect gut  <cit> . in addition to their role in the formation of the pm, peritrophins may also play a role in preventing the toxic effects of heme, a bi-product of blood meal digestion. in a. aegypti, aeimuc <dig>  a mucin that encodes putative chitin-binding domains was recently shown to bind heme  <cit> . although peritrophins have been characterised from several insects, including a. aegypti and a. gambiae  <cit> , no information exists related to sandfly midgut-specific peritrophins. ppper <dig> and ppper <dig> have high sequence similarity, at the protein level, to the translated sequences sfm-03c <dig> and sfm-02h <dig> from the l. longipalpis est database. however, ppper <dig> has lower sequence similarity to any of the assembled and translated sequences from the l. longipalpis est database, suggesting a more divergent or novel molecule.

trypsins
among the most abundant transcripts in the cdna libraries were the previously characterised p. papatasi trypsin-like, pptryp <dig>  , and pptryp <dig>   <cit> . pptryp <dig> and pptryp <dig>  were less abundant with  <dig> and  <dig> sequences, respectively. phylogenetic analysis of trypsins from p. papatasi and from other organisms resulted in the formation of two major clades . p. papatasi trypsins co-localised in clade i containing other insect trypsins, while their mammalian counterparts were found in clade ii . as detected previously,  <cit>  pptryp <dig> and pptryp <dig> form a different clade apart from a clade formed by pptryp <dig> and pptryp <dig> . the p. papatasi trypsins pptryp <dig>  pptryp <dig>  pptryp <dig>  pptryp <dig>  show high protein sequence similarity to l. longipalpis ests nsfm-02a <dig>  nsfm-113h <dig>  nsfm-94b <dig>  and nsfm-165c <dig>  respectively.

chymotrypsin
two previously characterised p. papatasi chymotrypsin-like cdna, ppchym <dig> and ppchym <dig>  <cit> , as well as a novel chymotrypsin-like, ppchym <dig>  were also found in the transcriptome database. this newly identified novel chymotrypsin-like molecule was found in low abundance in the blood-fed midgut library. the predicted ppchym <dig> has 36% amino acid identity to ppchym <dig> and 30% amino acid identity to ppchym <dig>  furthermore, ppchym <dig> has a signal secretory peptide  and has the required his/asp/ser amino acid triad necessary for catalytic activity . ppchym <dig> and ppchym <dig> both share sequence homology from the assembled sequence nsfm-01d <dig> from the l. longipalpis est database, while ppchym <dig> is most similar to sequence sfm-01b <dig> 

carboxypeptidase
a number of sequences were identified with homology to carboxypeptidases. the full-length transcript of a putative carboxypeptidase b,ppcpepb, was found from  <dig> sequences in cluster  <dig> and has high homology to a carboxypeptidase b identified in a. aegypti . the predicted amino acid sequence of ppcpepb contains a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and a carboxypeptidase domain. a putative carboxypeptidase a, ppcpepa, was also identified from cluster  <dig> based on amino acid sequence homology. phylogenetic analysis shows that the identified p. papatasi putative carboxypeptidases are separated into distinct clades . comparison of sequence homology indicates the potential for these molecules to have substrate specificities of either carboxypeptidases a or b . sequence alignment of the two carboxypeptidases depicts the difference in amino acid composition; however, both sequences contain the zinc ion binding motifs of metallocarboxypeptidases . additionally, the presence of a putative signal peptide alludes that these molecules are midgut digestive enzymes. similarity between these carboxypeptidases and those present in l. longipalpis est database is evident by the high homology between ppcpepa and sfm-05c <dig> and between ppcpepb and nsfm-32d <dig> 

astacin-like zinc metalloprotease
a putative astacin-like zinc metalloprotease  was identified from cluster  <dig>  a product of five sequences. this putative astacin-like protein displays a predicted signal peptide and a slightly modified form of the signature zinc binding catalytic domain for proteins in the astacin family . in ppastacin, changes in two residues  resulted in the motif heflhalgffhmqsasdr . although the altered residues may be involved in target specificity the zinc-binding catalytic domain remains conserved. the likely role of this putative protein is blood meal digestion, as astacins molecules have not been implicated in immune functions and a considerable number of transcripts constituting this cluster were derived from the blood-fed midgut cdna library. this is the first report of this type of protease from the gut of a sandfly, though nsfm-127b <dig> of the l. longipalpis est database was identified based on sequence homology.

kazal-type serine protease inhibitor
two kazal-type serine protease inhibitors were identified from cluster  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the cdna midgut libraries. ppkzl <dig> codes for a small peptide of  <dig> amino acids while ppkzl <dig> codes for a peptide of  <dig> amino acids. both proteins are predicted to be secreted based on the presence of signal peptides . ppkzl <dig> is similar to various small kazal-type inhibitors found in drosophila pseudoobscura , c. sonorensis  and the mosquitoes a. aegypti and a. gambiae, and to larger kazal-type molecules such as infestin  <cit>  from triatoma infestans . there is only 28% identity and  <dig> % similarity between ppkzl <dig> and ppkzl <dig>  suggesting these may have different functions. additionally, these two kazal-type cdnas are similar to the previously characterised thrombin inhibitor, rhodniin,, from the triatomine rhodnius prolixus  <cit>  . due to their anti-hemostatic effect, rhodniin and infestin are believed to play a role in the fluidity of the blood within the midgut of these vectors. it is conceivable that one or both transcripts coding for kazal-type thrombin inhibitors identified in p. papatasi may play a role in blood fluidity within the sandfly midgut, allowing it to be fully digested by the various proteases secreted within the midgut following the blood meal. these represent the first kazal-type serine protease inhibitors identified from sandflies. ppkzl <dig> shares low sequence similarity with sfm- <dig> from the l. longipalpis est database and no significant similarities were identified for ppkzl <dig> 

ferritin
two transcripts encoding putative ferritin light  and heavy  chain subunits were identified in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . after the ingestion of a blood meal the fly encounters a tremendous dose of iron and heme which would be fatal to most organisms. ferritin is one of the important factors in controlling the high iron load in hematophagous insects. the midgut of blood-feeding insects envelopes the blood meal and consequently makes the midgut tissue the most likely site of iron regulatory molecules. however, ferritin may also be important for oxidative stress not related to the presence of iron or heme, as it is induced by the presence of h2o <dig> in a. aegypti  <cit> . ppflc and ppfhc are similar to nsfm-144g <dig> and nsfm-146d <dig>  respectively; molecules identified by searching the l. longipalpis est database.

glutathione s-transferase 
from clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  two transcripts were identified to encode putative gsts with homology to other dipteran gsts in the sigma and delta/epsilon classes, respectively. the predicted molecular weights of the two putative proteins are similar at  <dig>  kda for cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  kda for cluster  <dig>  within the midgut, these proteins may play an important role in the regulation of reactive oxygen species which occur as a by-product of hemoglobin digestion. cluster  <dig> and  <dig> share high protein sequence similarity with l. longipalpis ests nsfm-105e <dig> and nsfm-74c <dig>  respectively.

unknown proteins
a large number of clusters produced by the three cdna libraries have no sequence similarity to other known proteins. this has also been observed in the analysis of the chironomus tentans midgut with good evidence that the unknown transcripts contained coding sequences  <cit> . it is also possible that the abundance of unidentifiable sequences may be caused by the sequence quality of the transcripts or that the captured sequences are 3' untranslated regions, non-coding small nuclear rna, or sequences of uncharacterised organisms such as bacteria and yeast present in the sandfly midgut. a number of clusters with unknown functions were identified as coding sequences which exhibited signal peptides, such as clusters  <dig> and  <dig> 

functionally characterised proteins
from the three cdna libraries, we identified chitinase transcripts which were then expressed as recombinant proteins for the demonstration of activity in the midgut of p. papatasi sandflies  <cit> . another product of the cdna libraries was the identification and characterisation of a galectin protein as the first arthropod receptor for a parasite; specifically, l. major within the p. papatasi sandfly midgut  <cit> .

comparative analysis of transcripts that significantly differ from the sugar-fed and blood-fed midgut cdna libraries
to investigate the effects of blood feeding on the midgut expression profile in p. papatasi, we compared the abundance of transcripts in sugar and blood-fed cdna libraries. we hypothesized that a blood meal will have an effect on the expression of sandfly midgut transcripts that will be reflected in the relative abundance of sequences forming a cluster in the two libraries. chi-square statistical analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the differences in the abundance of midgut transcripts from unfed and blood-fed cdna libraries thereby identifying different expression profiles of selected midgut transcripts in each cdna library.

we observed a significant difference  in the abundance of a number of midgut transcripts when we compared the sugar-fed and blood-fed sandfly midgut cdna library. table  <dig> shows a list of selected transcripts that were either more abundantly or less abundantly expressed in these two cdna libraries.

as expected, transcripts coding for proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin , and chymotrypsin  were more abundantly represented in the blood-fed cdna library than in the sugar-fed cdna library . other transcripts coding for peritrophin and microvilli-like proteins and ferritin were also more abundantly represented in the blood-fed cdna library. also, we observed a number of transcripts that were less abundantly represented in the blood-fed cdna library, such as tryspin  <dig> , and peritrophin .

validation of transcript abundance of selected sequences by real-time pcr
in order to validate the results observed by the chi-square analysis, we further characterised several transcripts by semi-quantitative end-point reverse-transcriptase pcr as well as by real-time pcr. these were utilised to assess the relative abundance of transcripts in the midgut tissue under sugar-fed and blood-fed conditions. the investigated transcripts included peritrophins ppper <dig> and ppper <dig>  as well as microvilli proteins ppmvp <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  and ppmvp <dig> 

the results of semi-quantitative pcr can be seen in figures 10b and 10d where the induction of ppper <dig> is clearly evident. the differences in ppper <dig> expression between the two midguts conditions is less clear using this technique . figure 10a shows the transcript abundance of ppper <dig> as fold change over the control gene in non blood-fed and post blood-meal ingestion as measured by real-time pcr. figure 10c shows the same real-time pcr analysis of the ppper <dig> transcript. the profile of the peritrophin transcripts by real-time pcr strongly correlates with the profile found in the libraries based on the number of sequences.

based on real-time pcr, ppper <dig> expression is induced by blood digestion and it is not detected in sugar fed midguts, corresponding with the lack of any sequences produced in the sugar-fed midgut cdna library, compared to  <dig> sequences found in the blood fed library. as predicted by the high sequence abundance of ppper <dig> in the sugar-fed cdna library the expression of this transcript is highest in unfed sand flies and seems to be down-regulated by the ingestion of a blood meal .

transcription levels of mrnas coding for microvilli-like proteins  tested by semi-quantitative pcr and real-time pcr are shown in figure  <dig> and illustrate the induction of transcription by the ingestion of a blood meal. this mirrors what is seen by the sequence abundance of the cdna library, in which only one sequence of ppmvp <dig> was observed in the sugar-fed cdna library. the remaining sequences were contributed by the cdna library produced from blood-fed sandflies.

pptryp <dig> low and pptryp <dig> high transcript abundance, were in accordance with the results of previously published endpoint reverse-transcriptase pcr  <cit> . additionally, the previously characterised chitinase molecule, ppchit <dig>  was identified in cluster  <dig> and produced by three sequences contributed by the blood-fed cdna library with none present in the sugar-fed cdna library. the mrna expression levels of ppchit <dig> peak at  <dig> hours post blood-meal ingestion  <cit> .

comparative analysis of transcripts significantly differs from the blood-fed and l. major-infected midgut cdna libraries
during its development within the midgut of the sandfly, leishmania is faced with various potential barriers that may prevent the establishment of the infection. among such potential barriers are digestive proteases , the peritrophic matrix and the requirement for parasite attachment to the midgut epithelia to prevent excretion of parasites with remnants of the digested blood. previous data suggested that leishmania is able to downregulate proteolytic activity in the sandfly midgut  <cit> . also, chitinases produced either by the sandfly  <cit>  or by the leishmania  <cit>  facilitates parasites in the escape from the peritrophic matrix. attachment to the midgut epithelia occurs via the presence of l. major lipophosphoglycan receptors, such as ppgalec  <cit>  or, in the case of permissive sandflies, via the presence of midgut glycoproteins bearing terminal n-acetyl-galactosamine  <cit> .

in sandflies, only a handful of midgut proteins have been clearly implicated in leishmania development. previous data indicated that leishmania is able to manipulate the activity of certain digestive proteases, inhibiting or delaying their peak activity, possibly in order to survive the proteolytic attack it faces in the midgut of the vector  <cit> . we hypothesized that a blood meal containing l. major will affect the expression profile of midgut transcripts altering the abundance of the different transcripts in each of these cdna libraries. table  <dig> shows the results of the chi-square analysis when transcripts from the blood-fed and l. major-infected blood-fed cdna libraries were compared. of interest, the abundance of transcripts coding for proteolytic enzymes were dramatically decreased in the midgut cdna library of sandflies fed on l. major-infected blood. additionally, other transcripts that also appear to have their number reduced included those coding for microvilli-associated like proteins and peritrophins. transcripts such as the one corresponding to pptryp <dig>  and one corresponding to ppper <dig>  were more abundant. other transcripts coding for unknown proteins were also less abundant in the l. major-infected cdna library than in the blood-fed cdna library. these data suggest that the parasite may be affecting the expression profile of these transcripts and this inhibition, particularly of proteolytic enzymes, may be advantageous for the survival and establishment of the parasite in the midgut of the sandfly.

CONCLUSIONS
development of leishmania within its sand fly host is largely restricted to the vector midgut. within the midgut leishmania begins its development confined within a peritrophic matrix and is subjected to the onslaught of digestive enzymes. later, they attach to the epithelia to prevent excretion with remnants of the blood meal and detach as they develop into the infective metacyclic form before being transmitted to a suitable host during a subsequent blood meal. the sandfly midgut presents a number of biological barriers the leishmania parasite must circumnavigate or defeat to proliferate and develop inside the insect vector. acquiring a better understanding of the molecules present in this organ will illuminate the potential molecular interactions occurring between the leishmania parasite and the sandfly vector. comparative transcriptome analysis provides a powerful global approach as demonstrated by the repertoire of molecules identified from a whole organism or from a specific tissue and the generation of new hypotheses from these data. large scale genome analyses benefit from data generated from transcriptome analyses, for example, by aiding in the annotation of exons and introns.

the results of the present work provide insights into the repertoire of the molecules present in the midgut of the sandfly p. papatasi, the natural vector of l. major. we identified a variety of molecules and obtained high quality, full-length sequences from many of them. the high quality sequences were deposited at ncbi, significantly augmenting the available midgut-specific coding sequences. a large number of non-annotated sequences were deposited in the est database for the scientific communities to access these transcripts.

the global changes in sandfly midgut expression profile were assessed by comparing data generated from randomly sequenced midgut cdna clones obtained from cdna libraries of adult females fed on sugar only, blood or blood with the addition of l. major. our approach allowed for the identification of transcripts that are induced by blood feeding and likely participate in the digestion of the blood meal and events leading to egg production. digestion of blood as a nutritional source is complicated by the cellular and molecular response and components of the blood itself, once ingested by the insect vector. transcripts identified in the p. papatasi midgut, such as ferritin, kazal-type serine protease inhibitors, and gst, are examples of the molecules identified on the gut of this insect. additionally, the inclusion of a l. major-infected midgut cdna library provides insight into genes potentially regulated by this parasite during its development within the sandfly midgut. the random sequencing approach followed by the in silico analysis of the transcript abundance was supported by experimental analyses obtained via real-time pcr.

overall, this analysis will contribute to the understanding of the molecular interactions between leishmania and the sandfly vector and may open new avenues for basic research towards the control of this neglected vector-borne disease.
