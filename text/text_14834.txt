BACKGROUND
currently, more than five million people in the united states suffer from alzheimer's disease , and given our aging population, this prevalence is expected to continue to rise  <cit> . neuropathologic hallmarks in ad include the formation of toxic amyloid β , its aggregation into globular oligomers  in the brain, and the subsequent formation of a neurotoxic protein leading to cognitive and behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration  <cit> . one reasonable approach to this future public health crisis is to decrease the incidence and possibly prevalence of ad through the development and administration of a human vaccination that prevents, slows, or removes this ad pathology in human brains.

the first attempt at developing such a vaccine was documented in  <dig>  when schenk et al. reported that aβ1– <dig>  when used as an active vaccine, can effectively remove aβ plaques in ad transgenic mouse brains  <cit> . another milestone vaccine study published in  <dig> showed that the use of aβ1– <dig> plus adjuvant as an active vaccine in the ad transgenic mouse model not only induced an effective remission of aβ plaques in the brain  <cit> , but also led to cognitive and behavioral improvements  <cit> . in other mouse model studies, passive immunotherapy with anti-aβ antibodies produced similar results  <cit> . further, yamamoto et al. demonstrated that antibodies to aβ1– <dig> may effectively inhibit the deposition of aβ in the brain  <cit> . weiner et al. also reported plaque-lowering in pdapp transgenic mice after an intranasal inoculation of aβ without adjuvant  <cit> .

mutated peptides have been shown to have different phenotypes. mutations in the app gene and the resulting mutant aβ peptides are highly associated with autosomal dominant ad. the dutch and flemish mutations are known to cause patterns of aggregation that strongly differ from those with wild type  aβ peptide  <cit> . further, the dutch and flemish mutations have different phenotypes  <cit> . while both the dutch and flemish mutations cause hemorrhage and amyloidosis in patients, only the flemish mutation causes ad  <cit> .

in addition, it is important to consider the possibility that vaccination with aβ may induce an unwanted inflammatory response. popovic et al. report that the presence of antigen-presenting hla-dr-positive and other immunoregulatory cells together with abnormal levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase reactants are consistently detected in tissue of ad neuropathology  <cit> . it has been theorized that ad-related inflammation could be a form of autoimmunity that potentially marks a more specific and progressive state of the disease  <cit> . vaccination with an aβ peptide, therefore, runs the risk of exacerbating this inflammation. and because vaccine adjuvants themselves can cause varying levels of inflammation  <cit> , the effect of the adjuvant is important to consider in the development of an ad vaccine.

the increased success with vaccinations using aβ peptides in mouse models of ad encouraged a human clinical trial. the study was a randomized, multi-centered, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using wt aβ peptide an <dig> as a vaccine in combination with the adjuvant qs- <dig> combined with polysorbate- <dig>  <cit> . the trial included patients aged  <dig> to  <dig> years of age with probable ad as determined by the mini-mental state examination   <cit> . unfortunately, meningoencephalitis occurred in 6% of the  <dig> participants, forcing this phase ii trial to be suspended by the united states food and drug administration. however, in a follow-up study of the vaccinated patients, some benefits were seen, including reduced ad-like pathology on autopsy  <cit>  and improved cognition  <cit> . while this study suggests that a vaccination with an aβ peptide may be helpful in humans, more work must be done to develop one that does not produce such serious side effects.

the cause of the adverse events in the an <dig> trial has not been identified, and further analysis is required to determine the mechanism of neuroinflammation and the associated meningoencephalitis. as part of the analysis, it is necessary to consider that the inflammatory response might actually have been triggered, at least in part, by the adjuvant, and not the antigen  <cit> . it has been proposed that the polysorbate- <dig> that was added to the qs- <dig> adjuvant to keep it from precipitating out may have contributed to the meningoencephalitis in the an <dig> trial  <cit> . in fact, other studies have shown that adjuvants themselves induce significant pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in vivo including up-regulation of tnf-α, ifn-γ, and il- <dig>  even without being coupled to an antigen  <cit> . immune modulation may also be affected by adjuvant administration, and this must be taken into account when selecting a particular adjuvant. importantly, this modulation may result in the production of different antibody subclasses  <cit> . these negative properties associated with adjuvants suggest that an adjuvant-free vaccine for ad would be an attractive prospect.

historically, the use of an adjuvant in vaccination was necessary to prime the immune system. however, our research group recently reported that mutations in the aβ1– <dig> peptide can change the antigenicity of the peptide  <cit> . this was further supported by a study by arendash et al. which demonstrated that adapted transfusion of aβ-peptide-specific t-cells into ad transgenic mice can reverse cognitive impairment, suggesting that t-cell activation may be necessary for aβ clearance  <cit> . the aβ peptide itself contains two strong b-cell epitopes, as well as a strong t-cell epitope  <cit> . previous studies suggested that adjuvant-free vaccination might help identifying pathways of autoimmunity  <cit> . these findings suggest that the aβ peptide itself may be able to serve as its own adjuvant.

one of the participants in the an <dig> trial was found to have multiple cortical hemorrhages upon autopsy  <cit> . indeed, mouse model studies have suggested that hemorrhage may be an adverse event of aβ vaccination that must be considered in the development of human aβ vaccines  <cit> . the mechanism behind hemorrhage post-aβ clearance has been proposed to be due to weakening of the vessel walls  <cit> . we believe that a vaccine that causes aβ clearance in the brains of older human patients can still be developed; however, the clearance should happen at a slow, steady rate to allow the vessel walls to acclimate to the removal of the plaque. this suggests that an appropriate vaccine should not induce a strong, quick immune response. rather, a good vaccine for the purpose of aβ plaque removal would demonstrate a slow increase in antibody that held at stable levels for a long duration in which memory response could be demonstrated. this is in contrast to the goal of prophylactic vaccines, which is to induce a quick and strong immune response in the vaccine.

the current scientific goal is to build upon our understanding of the results of the an <dig> trial to find a safer and more effective vaccine candidate. the aim of this study is to test adjuvant-free vaccines using aβ peptides, both wt and those with mutations in the t-cell epitope, and evaluate their efficacy and safety. here, we report the successful vaccination of balb/c mice with several adjuvant-free mutated aβ peptides.

RESULTS
antibody response
mutated and wt aβ1– <dig> peptide vaccinations induced clear antibody responses after  <dig> inoculations  and high antibody level after  <dig> inoculations, while no antibody could be detected in the control group . there was a high antibody response  <dig> days after the third vaccination for all peptide vaccine groups at 1: <dig> dilutions, and antibody titers rose to greater than 1: <dig> in all peptide vaccine groups . there were no differences in peptide recognition among various anti-sera and peptides, with the exception of wt  and p24m , which were higher regardless of coating antigen . antibody was long-lasting, showing duration of up to  <dig> months . memory response was also apparent when comparing antibody levels before and after boosting .

in summary, all peptides used in this study induced good antibody responses. however, pfm , pfdm  and p22w  had better antibody duration responses.

epitope mapping
all antibodies induced by the different peptides injected demonstrated binding to wt aβ1– <dig> and 1– <dig> . figure  <dig> shows non-adjuvant epitope mapping in blue  compared to adjuvant vaccine epitope mapping in purple from a previously published study  <cit> . in this previous study, mpl+tdm  was used as an adjuvant because freud was prohibited for use in vaccine studies in mice, and mpl+tdm is water soluble , avoids emulsification of the peptide, and preserves the antigen  <cit> . mpl has been demonstrated to drive a th <dig> response in mice  <cit>  and performed similarly in our earlier study as in other vaccine studies using this adjuvant  <cit> . it is apparent there is no difference in epitope between the adjuvant and non-adjuvant. toellner et al has reported a study that cautions that mutant peptides may be subject to epitope switching  <cit> . our results indicate that there was no epitope switching among mutations, and additionally, there were no differences in epitope when compared to the adjuvant vaccine.

cytokine expression, t-cell response and igg isotyping
several peptides induced low levels of il- <dig>  tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> . all peptides except p22w produced an igg1/igg2a ratio that was either higher or no different post-vaccination than pre immunization. this indicates a high th <dig> response . also per figure  <dig>  pdm, pfdm and p24m demonstrated a th <dig> type antibody response.

we also compared wt and dutch mutation igg1/igg2a ratio with data from a previous study  <cit>  to compare th <dig> or th <dig> response to peptides administered with adjuvant. as shown in figure  <dig>  non-adjuvant vaccine induced a higher th <dig> response compared to adjuvant vaccine in both wt and dutch mutation peptides.

in conclusion, some of the non-adjuvant peptide vaccines were directed towards a th <dig> response , and also showed a peptide-specific response . pdm, pfdm and p22w showed lower pro-inflammation response .

anti-sera cross-reactivity
discussion
we found several adjuvant-free vaccine candidates that produced results suggesting both efficacy and safety. several candidates demonstrated a good antibody response that lasted at least  <dig> months , and showed good memory response after boost . these findings are consistent with the an <dig> follow-up findings by hock et al. in which sustained increases in serum antibodies against aβ were demonstrated  <cit> . epitope mapping was shown to be no different between our non-adjuvant and other adjuvant-containing vaccines, and th <dig> response was observed among some of the non-adjuvant peptides tested. these results are encouraging, suggesting we have identified peptides that may be effective for human vaccination.

in terms of safety, in our study of non-adjuvant peptide vaccines, inflammation levels varied minimally among the groups of mice vaccinated with mutated aβ peptides, and those levels differed from controls as well as levels in mice vaccinated with wt peptide. the cytokine profiles for mutated peptide vaccinated mice indicated a peptide-specific response with elevated th <dig>  and th <dig>  associated cytokines. cytokine profiles in our study showed peptide-specific differences with respect to markers of pro-inflammation, such as tnf-α and il- <dig> . some mutated peptides induced an anti-aβ antibody igg <dig> response , while others induced an igg2a response, such as pdm, pfdm and p24m ; this can be compared to pwt and pdm with adjuvant vaccine, which induced a significant th <dig> response . in addition, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were not correlated with antibody titers . given that the th <dig> response to the adjuvant-free vaccines in our study was higher when compared to adjuvant vaccine response, and that there was no evidence of these peptides inducing unwanted inflammation, avoiding the use of an adjuvant may be beneficial. if a poor th <dig> response was part of the reason for the meningoencephalitis in the an <dig> trial, using a non-adjuvant vaccine with one of the candidate peptides used in this study would be a reasonable approach.

one of the major concerns regarding vaccination with mutated peptides is epitope switching  <cit> . our results show that all peptides in the presence or absence of adjuvant map to the same epitope , suggesting that this was not a concern in our study.

our study has several strengths. an important strength of our study is that we tested several peptides and identified several candidates for further study. t-cell response was indeed variable across the peptides tested, but our results offer the choice of peptides for further study based upon these data. for example, pdm and pfdm demonstrated a low inflammatory response , but a high th <dig> response . we also demonstrated that, with these vaccinations, an adjuvant is not necessary to achieve the desired responses.

on the other hand, our study also has limitations. like the an <dig> vaccination, the peptides used in our study contained the entire t-cell epitope. using peptides that include only part of the t-cell epitope might improve the desired inflammatory response to the vaccine, and should be a subject of future study. in addition, although we measured cytokine expression and conducted antibody isotyping, we did not actually measure t-cell responses. results from our previous study suggested that the t-cell epitope is related to haplotype  <cit> , so we will conduct t-cell epitope mapping when we conduct this study in a transgenic mouse model. finally, our study was done only in balb/c mice, so the results need to be confirmed by conducting a similar study in app transgenic mice. since there is a high level endogenous aβ produced in transgenic mice, immune response may be different compared to balb/c mice  <cit> . it is also unclear how the results may translate to other animals and to humans.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that an adjuvant-free vaccine with different aβ peptides can be an effective and safe vaccination approach against ad. our adjuvant-free vaccines induced a good antibody response without stimulating an unwanted inflammation reaction. furthermore, mutations in the t-cell epitope did not affect the b-cell epitope, but generated different levels of inflammation response. our results provide several mutant aβ peptides as viable candidates for further study of adjuvant-free vaccines. further studies in which the entire t-cell epitope is not contained in the aβ peptide are also warranted, as this may further address inflammatory reactions.

this study represents the first report of adjuvant-free vaccines utilizing aβ peptides carrying diverse mutations in the t-cell epitope. these largely positive results provide encouragement for the future of the development of human vaccinations for ad.
