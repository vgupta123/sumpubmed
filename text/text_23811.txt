BACKGROUND
in yeast several transcription factors and sequence motifs are known to ensure timely expression of genes whose products are required at specific phases in the cell cycle  <cit> . for instance, genes with the ecb motif upstream are predominantly transcribed in the m/g <dig> boundary of the cell cycle, while presence of the mcb motif is correlated with high expression in the g <dig> phase. spellman et al.  <cit>  used temperature-sensitive mutants of cdc <dig> and cdc <dig>  as well as stimulation by the α-factor mating pheromone, to induce synchrony in budding yeast . the aim was to identifying all cell cycle regulated genes in yeast by selecting genes that exhibited consistent periodic expression in cultures synchronized by these different methods. however, it has subsequently been noted that there are genes that appear to be periodically expressed only when some of the synchronization methods are used  <cit> . the different synchronization methods are bound to affect the system in different ways, and so it is to be expected that different dynamics follow the perturbation. here we study this phenomenon of perturbation-dependent phase-specific expression and the corresponding cis-regulatory control structures in the yeast cell cycle. in doing so we devise a method in which prior information is incorporated in a model-based treatment of gene expression data, a method we expect to be useful in other analyses.

several studies have used computational methods to uncover cis-regulatory control structures in yeast from high-throughput data sources. an important step was taken by pilpel et al.  <cit>  who observed that expression was more concordant for genes sharing two upstream sequence motifs than for genes sharing only one motif. this suggested that the expression program of the yeast genome in general is determined by combinations of regulatory elements and stimulated several computational studies aimed at identifying these regulatory mechanisms using sequence motifs and expression data. segal et al.  <cit>  used clusters of similarly expressed genes as initial regulatory modules, found common motifs for these modules and then iteratively refined them by reassigning genes whose promoter regions did not match the motif profile of their current module. beer and tavazoie  <cit>  found a large number of sequence motifs that were overrepresented in a set of expression clusters, and inferred a statistical  relationship between these motifs and the clusters. hvidsten et al.  <cit>  and wilczyński et al.  <cit>  retrieved motif combinations by computing minimal sets of motifs necessary to separate genes in overlapping expression clusters. the common denominator for all these studies, as well as other related studies  <cit> , is that expression similarity is characterized in terms of the presence of combinations of sequence motifs or other cis-regulatory information. the resulting sets of putatively co-regulated genes are then often evaluated using external data such as gene function annotations  <cit>  or by considering additional experimental support such as binding of transcription factor to gene promoters  <cit> . a different route was taken by segal et al.  <cit>  and pham et al.  <cit>  who directly addressed the transcriptional network by using the notion that expression of genes  affect transcription of other genes in a direct, but not necessarily causative fashion. for instance, segal et al.  <cit>  constructed decision trees for co-regulated sets of genes  where the internal nodes in the tree were decisions based on the expression level of known transcription factors. this approach, as the above, relies on identifying groups of genes with similar expression. however, instead of explaining expression similarity with cis-regulatory descriptors, transcription factors were found whose joint expression pattern was concordant with that of a cluster of genes. nevertheless, little information about putative physical interactions was provided since actual binding or occurrence of binding motifs was not included.

although the previously reported clustering approaches generate interesting hypotheses on regulatory mechanisms, none of them make efficient use of any prior knowledge about the studied cellular process. this is in contrast to the model-based classification of expression profiles that we present here. rather than using clustering, we employ a previously published bayesian detector where a sinusoidal function and prior knowledge of cell division times is used to model periodic temporal profiles  <cit> . the detector is used to classify the temporal expression profiles as periodic or aperiodic for each of the three experiments using different synchronization methods published by spellman et al.  <cit> . we argue that this class division is more suited for investigations of cell cycle regulation than a class division based on clustering . with periodic expression as the criterion for class inclusion, the classes are directly associated with phase-specific regulation and, consequently, with the cell cycle machinery. when clustering is used, relationships between the classes and cellular processes may only be inferred from secondary data such as functional annotations. furthermore, we show that the new approach yields understanding of regulation in terms of novel cis-regulatory descriptors. each cis-regulatory descriptor is a binary variable that corresponds to the simultaneous presence or absence of an upstream sequence motif and observed binding of a transcription factor. several of these interactions are supported in the literature. we then use a previously published rule-based method  <cit>  to model the information available about the regulation of the periodic genes defined by the bayesian detector as logical rules associating minimal combinations of descriptors with one or more of the periodic classes. an overview of the method is given in figure  <dig> 

our results provide several fundamental observations about the regulation of the s. cerevisiae cell cycle. firstly, we show that combinations of cis-regulatory descriptors are better at explaining the periodic classes than single descriptors. secondly, we demonstrate that these combinations are specific to different periodic classes. although others have argued that the variation in periodic behavior of the different synchronization studies is experimental noise  <cit> , our results seem to indicate that the synchronization methods induce different perturbations that initially activate different regulatory mechanisms visible in the two first periods of the cell cycle. thirdly, we show that combinations of regulatory descriptors specific to genes that are periodic in only one synchronization experiment are frequently subsets of combinations specific to genes periodic in two experiments, which again are subsets of combinations for genes periodic in all three experiments. this suggests that the periodic classes are regulated in an additive fashion. finally, we show that combinations retrieved using the model-based detector are much more specific towards known phase-specific motifs and transcription factors than when employing conventional clustering. this illustrates that replacing clustering-based classification of dynamic gene expression patterns with model-based classification is advantageous for discovering the mechanisms underlying cellular control processes.

in the context of previous methods explaining expression clusters with cis-regulatory information, the novelty of our work chiefly consists in a model-based treatment of the dynamical gene expressions. this allows us to retrieve more relevant regulatory mechanisms than when using expression similarity . we show this by letting the same machine learning method first discover regulatory mechanism explaining periodic classes and then by trying the same process using expression similarity. importantly, the use of periodic classes makes it easier for the investigator to interpret the hypotheses since they take the form of statements about how the genes expression behaves under different experimental conditions. we believe this is an improvement over methods where genes are grouped into expression clusters since these clusters only can be assigned semantics retrospectively, e.g. by looking for overrepresentation of annotations within the cluster or visual inspection of the expression pattern of the cluster. given the systemic, genome-wide evaluation outlined above, we believe that our method provides reliable predictions for the regulatory mechanisms underlying periodic expression. in addition, the new approach introduced here is generic and may easily be adjusted to the analysis of other types of temporal gene expression profiles.

RESULTS
our study includes several steps towards demonstrating how a model-based treatment of gene expression results in the retrieval of more focused and relevant regulatory mechanisms than what is obtained by expression profile clustering. first we describe how we divide the genes into different classes depending on which synchronization method induces periodicity in three synchronization experiments  <cit> . to this end, we use a previously published detector of periodic expression  <cit> . this detector only relies on the approximate period time and cyclicity of the process. then we explain how we combine sequence motifs and transcription factor binding from chip-chip experiments  <cit>  to obtain cis-regulatory descriptors. these are later used as the basic building blocks for constructing regulatory mechanisms. having obtained descriptors of the genes that reflect possibilities of regulation, we perform statistical tests to show that it indeed is possible to explain the periodic classes with cis-regulatory descriptors. we start by testing for overrepresentation of single descriptors, and go on to pairs of descriptors. since we see that pairs of descriptors explain the periodic classes better than single descriptors, we proceed by retrieving higher order combinations. to this end, we apply a previously published rule-based approach  <cit> . we interpret the rules and use them to explain the structure of the periodic classes. in particular, we observe that we can organize the regulatory mechanisms in a hierarchical structure that mimics the hierarchical structure of the periodic classes. we compare the regulatory mechanisms we obtain from applying our approach to periodic classes with those obtained from conventional expression clusters . this shows that our model-based approach enables the retrieval of regulatory mechanisms that are much more specific towards known cell cycle regulators. finally, we illustrate some of the strongest regulatory mechanisms using a network-representation. we also present a gene ontology analysis of the periodic classes to further confirm the biological significance of our class division.

class generation
periodic classes were computationally inferred from expression measurements. we applied a previously published detector of periodic expression  <cit>  that took into account the approximate period time of the cell cycle in the α-factor, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> experiments reported by spellman et al.  <cit> . basically, the detector calculates a statistic s which is restricted to the unit interval  <cit>  for each of the expression profiles where s =  <dig> corresponds to absolute certainty in periodic expression and s =  <dig> to no support for periodic expression . figure  <dig> shows the score assigned in the α-factor, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> experiment to each gene. it shows a strong pattern where the majority of genes is assigned a score close to either  <dig> or  <dig> in each experiment. however, the observed correlation is poor; there are many genes that show signs of periodic expression in the cdc <dig> experiment but not in the α-factor experiment and vice versa, and similarly for the cdc <dig> experiment.

from the expression data we select genes that have a high score for periodicity in at least one of the experiments and a very low score in the other, thus removing uncertain categorizations. consequently we divide the genes from the microarray experiments into several classes, depending on whether they are detected as periodically expressed or not. to classify a gene as periodically expressed, one must choose a threshold for the detector statistic s. a trade-off must be made as to maximize the number of genes in the dataset while keeping the number of false positives at a minimum. we used the criteria a : s <snp =  <dig>  and b : s > sp =  <dig>  to classify each gene as periodic  or not periodic  in each of the experiments. the  <dig> genes that fulfilled either of these criteria were then divided into eight classes labeled  <dig>   <dig> ..., <dig>   <dig>  each digit in the label corresponds to α-factor, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> from left to right and takes value  <dig> or  <dig> depending on whether criterion a or b is fulfilled for that gene in the corresponding experiment. in the following we shall refer to the classes of genes that are detected as periodically expressed in at least one experiment, i.e. all classes excluding  <dig>  as the periodic classes.

the number of genes assigned to each class is shown in table  <dig>  with the strict criteria a and b, the number of genes that was included in the data set constitutes roughly 1/ <dig> of all genes in the genome . some classes contain very few genes, for instance, genes that are periodically expressed only in the cdc-based experiments . here we note again that the two sided criterion results in robust class separability. due to criterion a it is not the case that e.g. some of the genes in class  <dig> would have moved to class  <dig> if the threshold in criterion b was slightly lowered. hence, the two sided criterion ensures that genes with uncertain periodicity are excluded from further analysis. the fact there are so few genes in class  <dig> is a testament to the high variability between the different synchronization methods. the actual number however depends on the specific thresholds chosen.

cis-regulatory descriptors
we aim to describe the different periodic classes in terms of cis-regulatory descriptors. we produced such cis-regulatory descriptors using the compilation of upstream sequence motifs published by hughes et al.  <cit>  in combination with the genome-wide location analysis showing the binding of transcription factors to gene promoters published by harbison et al.  <cit> . these datasets both contain noise. in particular, we expect a large number of the sequence motifs to be non-functional . moreover, since bindings in the genome-wide location analysis are inferred from the measured signal strength using some arbitrary threshold, we would expect this data to contain both false positives and false negatives.

in order to automatically curate false positives we formed new descriptors of the form x - y where x is a transcription factor and y a sequence motif present at the same gene in the genome wide location analysis and upstream sequence motif data, respectively. we then filtered these transcription factor-motif pairs and retained pairs where the transcription factor was statistically associated with the motif or vice versa. to ensure that most of the motifs and transcription factors were included, we selected the three best scoring significant pairs  for each transcription factor and each motif for further analysis .

it was encouraging to see that known transcription factor-motif pairings such as mcm1-mcm <dig>  mbp1-mcb, swi6-mcb, swi4-scb, yox1-ecb and hir2-cca were recovered. this strengthens our belief in the predicted novel relationships where the motif is putative or the association between the transcription factor and the motif has not been described earlier . some illustrative examples are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  note that the best scoring motif for transcription factor abf <dig> is the abf <dig> motif .

the three most significantly co-occuring sequence motifs for the yox <dig>  ume <dig> and abf <dig> transcription factors.

the three most significantly co-occuring transcription factors for the scb and sff sequence motifs.

inclusion of a pair in the further analysis is due either to the transcription factor being among the three best scoring factors for the motif or vice versa. for example, note in table  <dig> that binding of transcription factor ume <dig>  which regulates early meiotic genes, is one of the three most significant transcription factors co-located with the scb motif. however, the scb motif is not one of the three most significant motifs that is co-located with the binding of ume <dig> . furthermore, the p-value is an indicator of the strength of the association. for example, we see a pair with ume <dig> which includes the putative motif m_glyoxylate_cycle_orfnum2sd_n <dig>  this motif was inferred from a group of genes known to be involved in the glyoxylate cycle by hughes et al.  <cit> . however, the p-value of this pair is much higher than the p-value of the two first, both of which are known to be associated with ume <dig>  thus one may have less confidence in this predicted interaction .

we described each gene in terms of the transcription factor-motif pairs found upstream of that gene. since not all the genes included in the periodic classes were covered by these pairs, the size of the periodic classes shrinked. the resulting class distribution of the  <dig> covered genes is shown in table  <dig>  in total,  <dig> transcription factor-motif pairs were kept, resulting in a list  of  <dig> binary elements, each indicating the presence or absence of a particular pair. it is important to note that these cis-regulatory descriptors were formed without using expression data, or more specifically, without any direct relation to the classes inferred from the microarray experiments.

the class distribution after all genes were represented in terms of the regulatory descriptors. compared to table  <dig>   <dig> genes did not match any regulatory descriptor .

describing expression with cis-regulatory descriptors
if the cis-regulatory descriptors explain the regulation of the periodic classes, it should be possible to observe a statistical dependency between the presence of a transcription factor-motif pair upstream  and the class designation of each gene. to investigate this, we calculated the probability that a descriptor matches by chance at least the observed number of genes from the same class. a p-value lower than  <dig>  indicates a significant overrepresentation of this descriptor in the promoters of genes from that specific class. this calculation was done for all descriptors that were associated with genes in each of the periodic classes. however, these p-values are not informative in themselves; due to the large number of descriptors one would expect to find many overrepresentations by chance. if there is no relationship between any of the descriptors and the class designation, the expected number of descriptors to have a p-value less than  <dig>  is  <dig>  × n, where n is the number of descriptors associated with the class. thus, a ratio of observed significant descriptors over expected significant descriptors greater than  <dig>  will indicate an overrepresentation of descriptors that are significant at the level of  <dig> . this ratio can also be complemented with a p-value . table  <dig> shows the ratio between expected and observed numbers and the corresponding p-values for each periodic class.

the second column contains for each class the ratios of the number of significant descriptors at the significance level of  <dig>  to the expected number of significant descriptors for single descriptors. also displayed  is the p-value of the ratio. to aid the reader the number of genes in each class is included in the last column.

as the ratio is close to  <dig>  for classes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it appears that single descriptors are not informative for these classes. this is also indicated by the associated high p-values. however, all classes of genes showing periodicity in more than one experiment have more significantly overrepresented descriptors than would be expected by chance. furthermore, in view of pilpel et al  <cit>  we do not expect it to be possible to differentiate between all classes on the basis of single descriptors. we find it more likely that transcription factors will interact with each other. to see if this appears to be the case, the same calculation was done for all pairs of regulatory descriptors. as is seen in table  <dig>  many more pairs of descriptors than single descriptors are significant compared to what would be expected by chance. the exception is class  <dig>  which actually has fewer significant pairs of descriptors than would be expected by chance. a possible interpretation could be that class  <dig> is very homogeneous with respect to the regulatory descriptors found in this class, i.e. a few pairs explain a very large part of the regulatory mechanisms for these genes. furthermore, class  <dig> remains close to the chance distribution. thus, it is not possible to statistically ascertain that this class of genes is different from other genes in the genome based on the available upstream regulatory information.

we were also interested in whether combinations of descriptors were specific to genes only clearly periodically expressed in a subset of experiments. thus, we performed the calculation again, this time with a background distribution of descriptor pairs formed only from genes in the periodic classes instead of all  <dig> genes . in this way we eliminated the possibility that the overrepresentation we saw in periodic classes was the result of genes observed as periodically expressed in at least one experiment, but that the actual assignment of genes into periodic classes was random. as is seen in table  <dig>  the pattern of overrepresentation remains and thus provides evidence for a relationship between descriptor pairs and class membership beyond that of the genes observed as periodically expressed in at least one experiment. the fact that the ratio drops is expected. as is shown by a gene ontology  <cit>  analysis of the periodic classes later in this study, the genes of class  <dig> participate in fundamentally different processes than the genes of the periodic classes. consequently, one expect periodic genes and aperiodic genes to be regulated differently in a more fundamental way than different periodic classes are.

combinations of cis-regulatory descriptors
having ascertained that there is a statistically significant relationship between the cis-regulatory descriptors and the periodic classes of genes, we proceeded to apply the rough set methodology of hvidsten et al.  <cit>  to recover higher-order combinations of descriptors. importantly, these combinations are minimal in terms of the number of descriptors required to discriminate genes in different classes with a user defined success rate α ≥ 95%. the resulting combinations can be presented in the form of rules, such as "if descriptor  <dig> and descriptor  <dig> then periodic or periodic", meaning that descriptor  <dig> and descriptor  <dig> are found co-located at gene promoters in classes  <dig> and  <dig>  and only those.

all rules induced by the method are ranked according to their p-values. such p-values are calculated as the probability that the descriptor combination in the left hand side of the rule by chance matches at least the observed number of genes in the class found on the right-hand side .

from this output we find some particularly interesting examples of regulatory mechanisms . e.g. the rule "if mbp1-stre' and swi6-mcb then periodic", which states that if the upstream region of a gene is bound by mbp <dig> and swi <dig> in the harbison et al.  <cit>  experiment and it has the stre' and mcb motifs upstream according to hughes et al.  <cit> , it is periodically expressed when the yeast cells are synchronized using α-factor and cdc <dig>  but not cdc <dig>  this particular rule has a right-hand side support of  <dig>  and a p-value of  <dig> . furthermore, this rule finds support in the literature. swi <dig> and mbp <dig> together form the mbf complex which regulates late g1-genes and binds the mcb motif  <cit> . another known interaction recovered in class  <dig> is the combination swi6-lys <dig> and swi4-scb . it is known that swi <dig> and swi <dig> form the sbf-complex which binds the scb motif and regulates g1-specific transcription  <cit> .

two examples of rules describing regulatory mechanisms that are known in the litterature.

a hierarchy of regulation
of particular interest are rules describing higher order combinations since they cannot be studied exhaustively in a reasonable time frame . the rough set methodology used here allows retrieving the most interesting higher order combinations in terms of their ability to discern the different classes. the average length and number of combinations retrieved in each periodic class is shown in table  <dig>  no class specific combinations were recovered for class  <dig> . this comes as no surprise since there are only four genes in this class. as is seen in table  <dig>  the average length of combinations in rules tends towards two for all classes. however, some higher order combinations are found. for example, in class  <dig> we have a combination of transcription factors fkh <dig>  fkh <dig> and mcm <dig>  it is known that mcm <dig> interacts with fkh <dig> or fkh <dig> in controlling the transcription of g2/m genes, and that fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> bind at the sff motif  <cit> . it was interesting to find that this particular combination was specific to class  <dig>  while subsets of the combination were found in other classes . such patterns, where different subparts of a regulatory combination are present in different classes, suggest a hierarchy of regulation. intrigued by this observation, we calculated the fraction of combinations found in each periodic class for which subsets could be found in other classes. as is seen in table  <dig>  more of the combinations of class  <dig> have subsets in other classes, followed by  <dig>  it is striking that even though  <dig> combinations specific to  <dig> are retrieved, only 59% had a subset that could be found in other classes. in class  <dig>  76% of the  <dig> combinations have subsets in other classes. class  <dig> is perhaps a better example since the sample size  is comparable to the sample size for class  <dig>  68% of the combinations in this class are supersets of combinations in other classes. consequently, the trend seen in table  <dig> suggests additive regulation, that is, when genes are periodically expressed under more conditions, more of the inferred combinations consist of supersets of combinations specific to genes periodically expressed under a smaller set of conditions .

comparison with clustering
previous work in this area has used clustering to obtain groups of genes expected to have similar regulation and then proceeded by using machine learning techniques to obtain combinations of sequence motifs that explain that grouping. to see how the class division used here compared to that of clustering we applied the clustering method of hvidsten et al.  <cit>  to the spellman et al.  <cit>  data. the principal difference is that combinations are recovered using classes defined by expression similarity. specifically, genes belong to the same class if the euclidean distance between the expression profiles is less than a predefined threshold d. since good validation sets of known regulatory modules are not available, we needed a suitable performance measure for comparing the different methods. we argue that a relevant measure in this case is the degree to which already known cell cycle regulators, both transcription factors and sequence motifs, are included in the combinations retrieved by the different methods. out of the motifs in the hughes et al.  <cit>  data set, we defined cca, ecb, mcb, swi <dig>  scb, sff, sff', mcm <dig> and mcm1' as cell cycle motifs after reviewing the literature. furthermore, from the literature we defined the following transcription factors in the harbison et al.  <cit>  data as cell cycle regulating: ace <dig>  fkh <dig>  fkh <dig>  gts <dig>  hir <dig>  hir <dig>  mbp <dig>  mcm <dig>  ndd <dig>  stb <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig>  xbp <dig>  ybr267w, yhp <dig> and yox <dig>  we can calculate the fraction of all these cell cycle regulators that are present in all significant rules at a specific p-value threshold as well as the fraction of regulators with no known relationship to the cell cycle. figure  <dig> shows a plot of these fractions generated by varying the p-value significance threshold from  <dig> to  <dig> 

as is seen in figure  <dig>  the method proposed in this paper is more specific towards cell cycle-related regulators than the clustering approach. for example, for the model-based approach one may select a significance level  so that 46% of the known cell cycle regulators are included in the rules but virtually none of the other regulators. clearly, a similar specificity towards cell cycle regulators is not possible using the clustering approach, even when the cluster inclusion threshold d is made stricter. in fact, the specificity degrades when the criterion becomes too strict . this may be explained by the fact that tighter inclusion thresholds give smaller groups from which it is more difficult to recover significant associations between different cis-regulatory descriptors and expression similarity. nonetheless, the expression data under consideration mostly contain periodic signals. this is apparent from the fact that the combinations retrieved using the clustering method also are geared towards cell cycle regulators. in fact, a method that selected combinations of cis-regulatory descriptors randomly would produce a curve that approximately follows a straight line between  and . the clustering approach, however, is notably different from such a straight line. we also visualized the points on the curves that correspond to the p-value thresholds that would have been chosen with bonferroni  or fdr correction for multiple hypothesis tests . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the model-based approach yields higher specificity than the clustering method when the bf threshold is chosen. also, as expected, the fdr procedure is less strict than bf. however, the important thing to note is that the rules with the lowest p-values are highly enriched for phase-specific regulators.

examples of putative mechanisms for cell cycle control
given the system-wide evaluation presented so far, we have reason to believe that many of the combinations retrieved may offer new insight into the specific regulation of cell cycle-related genes. it might be particularly interesting to look at cis-regulatory descriptor combinations at a p-value threshold that we know will include mostly known phase-specific regulators. combinations of these known phase-specific regulators as well as of known phase-specific regulators and other regulators may provide testable hypotheses explaining the selective regulation of periodic expression. the point  on the curve representing our method in figure  <dig>  is a good example. this point is associated with  <dig> rules with p-value lower than  <dig> . these rules include  <dig> of the  <dig> known phase specific regulators  and  <dig> other regulators . furthermore, they describe 24% of the genes in the periodic classes. figure  <dig> shows the co-occuring transcription factors in these rules. the figure mostly explains the regulation of genes in classes  <dig> and  <dig> since these classes are associated with the most significant combinations of cis-regulatory descriptors. consequently, lower thresholds need to be chosen if one wants to study the specific regulatory mechanisms of other classes. thresholds that balance the number of known phase-specific regulators against the number of other regulators may be obtained from the class-specific curves similar to that of figure  <dig> .

biologically meaningful classes
it is possible that the different synchronization methods evoke detectable periodic signals from functionally different groups. we analyzed gene ontology  <cit>  "biological processes" associated with the classes to see if some annotations occurred more often within a class than would be expected by chance. one immediately notices that class  <dig> predominantly consists of metabolic genes. for example, among the  <dig> genes annotated to "protein metabolism" ,  <dig> genes belong to class  <dig> .

considering the seven periodic classes together, one notes a large number of "cell cycle"  annotations.  <dig> out of  <dig> genes annotated to "cell cycle" are found in the periodic classes . notably, the term "cell cycle" is a rather general designation, and it is therefore expected that not all genes annotated to this term are periodically expressed. on the other hand, many genes not annotated to "cell cycle" could still be periodic. for example, although  <dig> out of  <dig> genes annotated to "protein catabolism"  were found in class  <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> genes annotated to the more specific subterm "cyclin catabolism" , a cell cycle-related process, were found in the periodic classes. this shows that although the genes of the periodic classes are annotated to a wide range of biological processes, many of these processes are cell cycle-related .

we also considered the periodic classes separately to see whether we could find terms specific to the different classes when compared to each other. for example, one would expect the genes in class  <dig> to be annotated to core processes of the cell cycle. indeed, the term "regulation of cell cycle"  was significantly overrepresented in class  <dig> at the  <dig>  level. although the functional signatures of the other periodic classes were rather specific, all periodic classes had some functions that were overrepresented only in that class. even though the associated p-values were only significant at the  <dig>  level, and were generally not sufficiently low to be significant when corrected for multiple hypotheses, we find it encouraging that unique functional signatures could be recovered for each of the periodic classes, even when the comparison was done only among the periodic classes. we interpret the existence of functional signatures as further evidence that the periodic classes inferred from expression data do not constitute a set of random selections of cell cycle genes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
there has been an upsurge in publications attempting to uncover genome-wide transcriptional control structures using machine learning strategies. we believe approaches such as the one presented here have two-fold use: i) they allow researchers with interest in particular genes or regulators to find in silico support for their hypotheses. ii) they demonstrate genome-wide properties of the transcriptional network. we were able to find known interactions in the data, and we expect predicted interactions to be a valuable resource for experimentalists when designing experiments.

the basic idea in the present work is to identify genes whose responses over time due to treatment are similar. however, such similarity will naturally depend on the measure of similarity used. as demonstrated here, it is possible to focus on a particular process of the system, like the cell cycle in budding yeast, by choosing a measure of similarity which divides the genes into classes that are known to be related to the process of interest. the cell cycle has some special characteristics that makes defining such a measure easy. however, one may very well define such measures with natural semantics for other biological settings. for instance, in an infection study one may be interested in finding regulatory descriptors corresponding to different stages of the infection. by designing a detector that specifically identifies genes active at different stages we would expect more relevant classes to be found than by relying on clustering. of course, designing such detectors can become quite cumbersome. an interesting direction of future research would be to use hidden markov models for dividing the genes into different groups. such models allow incorporation of prior knowledge about the dynamics of the process and has been successfully applied to gene expression data  <cit> .

one notable exception to the use of clustering analysis is tsai et al.  <cit>  where transcription factors were defined as cell cycle-related if the genes they were regulating had a significantly different expression level in at least one of five phases of the cell cycle compared to one or more of the other phases. although this is an interesting approach, we were fascinated by the large discrepancies between sets of genes detected as periodic in s. cerevisiae for different synchronization methods  <cit> . our work lends support to the notion that periodic expression is conditioned on different stimuli. using descriptors of possible cis-regulatory elements, we were able to find regulatory combinations specific to different sets of synchronization methods. it should be noted that the rationale for using different synchronizations in the experiments by spellman et al.  <cit>  was to be able to identify a signal that is assumed to be common across the experiments corresponding to the physiological pattern of expression in the cell cycle. in this study we instead acknowledged that different synchronization methods may correspond to different environments  in which the cells propagate, and sought to explain why genes have different expression patterns with respect to periodicity under these conditions. the fact that it is possible to find combinations of transcription factors and sequence motifs that are significantly more common among genes within our classes supports this hypothesis. however, the expression data was only available for the two first periods of the s. cerevisiae cell cycle, thus we cannot claim that the differences in periodic behavior are long-lived. in fact, it is intuitively more appealing to regard these differences as temporary in the sense that the effects of different initializations of the cell cycle  will die out in the long run.

the fact that we group genes according to periodicity in three different synchronization experiments, and not according to conventional expression similarity, means that we cannot expect all genes within a periodic class to be regulated by the same mechanism. indeed, what we see is many different mechanisms describing different subsets of genes within each periodic class. in principle, we could have subdivided our periodic classes into cleaner regulatory modules based on, for example, the time of peak expression. however, with several of the periodic classes already containing very few genes, a more practical approach was to let the rule method arrive at this subdivision automatically based on the available cis-regulatory information and the periodic classes.

the periodic classes are inferred exclusively via computational analysis of expression data, and no biological experimental validation has been performed. the class division will depend on the specific thresholds of detection. the results presented here are based on a scheme known as "classification with rejection" where genes for which neither outcome is supported are rejected from further analysis. we also attempted a class division with a single sided criterion , classifying genes as periodic if s >  <dig>  and non-periodic otherwise. using this single criterion for classification we found the gene ontology term "regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity"  to be overrepresented in class  <dig>  the set of genes detected as periodically expressed only in the cdc-experiments. this was encouraging since the cdc-based synchronizations act by interfering with different cyclin dependent protein kinases  <cit> . however, as expected, such a criterion renders a class distribution that is skewed towards class  <dig>  thus, this reduces the chances of extracting rules describing the regulatory mechanisms of the  few representatives in the periodic classes.

we also attempted the use of only motifs or only transcription factors as descriptors. results were similar; the class division based on detected periodicity was more specific towards cell cycle regulators than the class division based on clustering. however, class specific overrepresentation of cis-regulatory elements  was weaker, indicating an advantage of using the novel cis-regulatory descriptors based on both sequence motifs and actual transcription factor binding. a further improvement of these descriptors would be to include proximity and order of the sequence motifs in the promoter regions  <cit> , however, such information was not utilized in this study.

the class-specific hierarchical structure of the discovered cis-regulatory descriptor combinations is an example of general system-wide properties discovered by our method. genes in class  <dig> have the largest fraction of combinations where smaller subsets are associated with more restricted periodic expression. note that due to the classification with rejection criterion discussed above, this hierarchy is not a trivial result of the class structure, e.g. genes in class  <dig> are neither a subset nor periodically similar to genes in class  <dig>  in fact, genes in class  <dig> have a low probability for being periodic in the third experiment. hence, the hierarchy suggests that the subsets of cis-regulatory descriptors are sufficient for periodic expression of the genes in fewer conditions. from an evolutionary standpoint it may be advantageous to ensure periodic expression of vital components in a wide variety of conditions by building in redundancy and to include many cis-regulatory elements. one alternative way to regulate periodic expression would have been to use only one phase-specific mechanism in genes that are always periodically expressed and to block periodic transcription in the appropriate conditions. however, this model has no support in the data and can be excluded.
