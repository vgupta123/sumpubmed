BACKGROUND
in the era of whole genome sequencing and proteomics, there has never been a greater need to develop versatile tools for gene functional studies. such studies necessitate a series of genetic manipulations including overexpression and/or downregulation of genes of interest either in in vivo and/or in vitro settings. downregulation of genes has been made possible by rna interference  technology  <cit>  and targeting genes using expressed short hairpin rna  <cit>  is currently the method of choice by a majority of researchers. the most successful rnai libraries based on retroviral  <cit>  and lentiviral expression  <cit>  of shrnas have also been utilized for large-scale functional genomic screens  <cit> .

many gene expression platforms have been developed over years that allow for the constitutive or inducible expression of genes/shrnas  <cit> . furthermore, several systems for the downregulation or overexpression of multiple targets have been adapted to address issues such as isoform redundancy, endogenous mutations of single shrnas and successful targeting of signaling pathways  <cit> .

expression platforms have been constructed either using classical restriction-enzyme based cloning technology or novel recombination based technologies, of which the gateway technology has gained an unprecedented use. gateway utilizes elements of site-specific recombination of escherichia coli bacteriophage lambda integrase/att to enable the transfer of genes between different vectors  <cit> . while many varieties of gateway-compatible vectors are available, problems may be encountered when either additional markers and/or different expression platforms are needed. this is especially the case for in vitro transformation experiments that are designed to introduce multiple genetic aberrations to cell lines in a stepwise fashion.

to enable efficient transfer of genes/shrnas through different expression platforms, we have combined aspects of the gateway system and restriction-based cloning technology and designed two entry vectors for either double shrna or cre/lox inducible gene expression and a series of lentiviral destination vectors containing an array of markers. we took advantage of already available and widely used expression/shrna vectors to facilitate the conversion of reagents from one platform to the other. we have generated an additional, fully compatible system with currently available gateway vectors which should further facilitate gene functional studies.

RESULTS
design of modified gateway shrna/gene expression system
we utilized a combination of restriction-based cloning and highly versatile gateway site-directed recombination technology for the construction of modified gene/shrna expression system. this system consists of two main components: gene/shrna entry and lentiviral destination vectors . shuffling of inserts from entry vectors to any of lentiviral destination vectors is mediated by lr recombination reaction. cloning details are provided in the materials and methods.

the double shrna entry vector, pentr.hu <dig> hh <dig>  was designed by combining shrna promoter cassettes from two published shrna expression vectors, psuper.retro and plko. <dig> puro. one advantage of this strategy is the availability of shrna cassettes based on the subcloning into psuper.retro or plko. <dig> puro. these cassettes are used for construction of the most extensively used shrna libraries  <cit> . while these libraries have been applied successfully over the last  <dig> years, one of their major limitations is the extent of available selection markers. this is often the case in cell lines that require multiple shrna or gene expression manipulations. therefore, subcloning of shrna libraries in a more versatile vector that allows for downstream transfer of shrna cassettes to various expression platforms is highly desirable. hence, the construction of pentr.hu <dig> hh <dig> would allow for easy transfer of subcloned shrna cassettes to different gateway based expression vectors, shrna targeting of multiple genes, and the increased knockdown of a single target using multiple shrna sequences. furthermore, since pentr.hu <dig> hh <dig> vector contains two different shrna expression promoters, this would possibly prevent subsequent endogenous recombinations known to occur in shrna vectors with the same tandem promoters  <cit> .

gene expression vector pentr.cmv.on is based on cre/lox recombination and contains cmv promoter and mcs flanked by loxp sites. most of the entry vectors available to date are promoterless and are recombined in promoter containing expression vectors. in addition, subcloning into these vectors can be accomplished by attb-pcr recombination avoiding restriction-based cloning. while these vectors have been extensively used, they might not be adequate for certain applications. for example, attb-pcr requires very long primer sequences which sometimes results in labor intensive and time consuming pcr troubleshooting especially during amplifications of large dna fragments. this might inadvertently increase a chance of possible transgene mutations arising during the pcr reaction. hence, researchers would still have to resort to a more accurate restriction enzyme-based cloning. furthermore, gene functional studies very frequently require the inducible transgene expression. to this end, we incorporated cre/lox technology to our gene expression platform. the final entry vector, pentr.cmv.on , contains a potent cmv promoter which provides a better chance of gene overexpression as well as loxp sites required for cre recombinase excision. to our knowledge, this is the first entry vector available for cre/lox based gene expression.

the destination vectors constructed in this study  are based on the lentiviral gene expression which is the most utilized system to efficiently transduce hard to transfect cell lines or primary mammalian cells. our destination vectors were engineered to express an array of selection markers through transgene independent promoters. while our system was under construction, two additional versatile gateway based expression systems were reported  <cit> . zhu et al.  <cit>  constructed bicistronic lentiviral gateway destination vectors with internal-ribosome entry site  which co-express the mir-shrna with a variety of selection markers. while ires has many advantages for the co-expression of transgenes, there have been some major limitations reported regarding their use. several reports have shown that the ires level of transgene expression depended considerably on the type of targeted cell  <cit> . additionally, it was shown that ires dependent translation could be affected by the first cistron with certain cistrons having inhibitory activity on ires through yet undefined mechanisms  <cit> . martin et al.  <cit>  have also reported that several commercially available bicistronic vectors based on the ires from encephalomyocarditis virus  have the 11th aug modified to a hindiii site to allow for easier subcloning  <cit> . however, this modification decreases dramatically the expression of the ires-controlled coding sequence. thus, our collection of lentiviral destination vectors will provide an alternative option to researchers faced with low level expression of the ires-controlled transgene.

campeau et al. have similarly developed an extensive array of lentiviral destination vectors  <cit>  including promoterless plentix <dig> series which are compatible with our entry vectors. however, in this work we have constructed additional destination vectors expressing yfp, hygro and dsred <dig> markers.

functionality of shrna double promoter expression entry vector
to demonstrate the efficacy of pentr.hu <dig> hh <dig> construct we assessed its silencing effect on single and multiple gene targets. to test the functionality of both hu <dig> and hh <dig> promoters, we created three double promoter shrna expression vectors with either shrna targeting exon  <dig> of p16ink4a  or nonsilencing shrna  under hu <dig> and/or hh <dig> . these vectors were transiently transfected into 293t cells and the p <dig> mrna expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction . the mrna knockdown was achieved when p16ex <dig> shrna was expressed either under the hh <dig> or hu <dig> promoter when compared to control vector. furthermore, there was a decrease in shrna knockdown when using hh <dig> promoter, which is consistent with the previous reports of hh <dig> being a weaker promoter as compared to hu <dig> promoter  <cit> . double expression of p16ex <dig> significantly decreased the p <dig> mrna levels in 293t cells as compared to a single expression of p16ex <dig> under either promoter. the additive/double suppression of p <dig> mrna could not be attributed to nonspecific effects of shrna silencing since vectors co-expressing both p16ex <dig> and control ns showed lower level of p <dig> knockdown as compared to vector doubly expressing p16ex <dig> 

our next experiment to test the functionality of pentrhu6hh <dig> involved creating stable cell lines that would allow enough time for any possible shrna recombinations known to arise in the targeted cells as a result of shrna expression  <cit> . if such events occur using our system, then the knockdown efficiency would be greatly impaired. to test this, we chose shrna against single targets, cyclin d <dig>  and cyclin d <dig> , which has been previously published  <cit> . we created three vectors pentr.shd <dig>  pentr.shd <dig>  pentr.shd <dig> shd <dig> and control vector expressing non-silencing shrna, pentr.shns . the resulting vectors were recombined with our destination vector plko.puro.dest and lentiviruses were generated for transduction into the panc- <dig> cell line. western analysis on protein lysates from puromycin-selected panc <dig> cells revealed specific knockdown of ccnd <dig> and ccnd <dig> with their respective shrnas . in addition, the panc <dig> cell line transduced with shd1_d <dig> lentivirus showed significant knockdown of both cyclin d <dig> and cyclin d <dig> proteins with no significant loss of single shrna effectiveness . an upregulation of ccnd <dig> in shd <dig> expressing panc- <dig> cells was noted. we observed the same effects previously  <cit>  and attributed it to a compensatory mechanism. these effects seem to be alleviated with the co-suppression of ccnd <dig> as demonstrated in our current results .

to determine whether our dual shrna expression vector can be used to maximize the efficiency of gene silencing we targeted two different regions in exon  <dig> of p16ink4b mrna. the experiments were performed on human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line h6c <dig> that expresses very high levels of p16ink4a due to loss of rb secondary to hpv e6/e <dig> expression  <cit> . the efficient knockdown of p16ink4a in h6c <dig> cells by shrna has presented a major challenge. while we tested  <dig> different shrnas against p16ink4a , none of the resulting h6c <dig> stable cell lines has shown greater than 60% reduction in p16ink4a levels. additional technical difficulty in the specific silencing of p16ink4a is that one can only target exon  <dig>  since exons  <dig> and  <dig> are shared with p14arf. this limits significantly the available mrna sequence for sirna design. to test if our dual shrna expression vector would overcome these problems, four entry vectors expressing either single or combination of the most effective shrnas against p16ink4a, shp16ab and shp16cd  <cit>  were recombined with the plko.yfp.dest vector . h6c <dig> cells were transduced with the resulting lentiviruses and the p <dig> protein levels were assessed by western blotting. as predicted, the expression of two shrnas against p16ink4a led to a more effective suppression of the p16ink4a level than a single shrna cassette . we also tested the actual p16ab and p16cd shrna expression under different promoters using q-rt-pcr . while both promoters efficiently expressed p16ab and p16cd shrna, there was a lower sirna expression under hh <dig> promoter as compared to hu <dig> promoter . a number of factors should be considered prior to usage of the hh <dig> and hu <dig> promoters, the first being the potency of the shrna used and the second being the cell type. the hh <dig> promoter should be employed for intermediate knockdown, while the hu <dig> can be used for more potent applications. hence, our double shrna expression vector can be particularly valuable for dose-dependent studies where variable expression is required.

functionality of cre/lox inducible entry vector
next, we tested the functionality and efficiency of pentr.cmv.on vector using both transient and stable transfections. for transient expression testing, cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  was subcloned into pentr.cmv.on vector. the resulting pentr.cdk <dig> on and empty control vector were transfected into 293t cells. as measured by q-rt-pcr, cdk <dig> was overexpressed  compared to the empty vector control . additionally, co-transfection with the cre expressing vector, pentr.cre, decreased the cdk <dig> mrna levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold relative to the control vector .

to create stable clones, we constructed vector expressing luciferase protein  and recombined it with the plko.dsred <dig> dest vector, thus creating the destination clone plko.dsred <dig> luc <dig> on. lentiviruses generated using plko.dsred <dig> luc <dig> on and control plko.dsred <dig> dest vectors were used to transduce hela cells, which were subsequently sorted for red <dig> fluorescence. luciferase protein was successfully overexpressed in hela-dsred <dig> luc <dig> on cells as measured by q-rt-pcr  and luciferase assay . transient transfection of pentr.cre into these cells resulted in a significantly decreased luciferase activity . taken together these results demonstrated the functionality of both pentr.cmv.on and plko.dsred <dig> dest vectors.

functionality of lentiviral destination vectors
while we successfully demonstrated the efficiency of destination vectors plko.puro.dest, plko.yfp.dest and plko.dsred <dig> dest , destination vectors expressing hygromycin  and green fluorescent protein  remained to be tested.

to test the performance of remaining destination vectors, h6c <dig> stable cell lines expressing dsred <dig> were generated using lentiviruses from plko.hygro.dsred <dig> and plko.egfp.dsred <dig> vectors. h6c <dig> cells were selected or sorted for their respective selectable markers and changes in red fluorescence were measured by flow cytometry. the plko.hygro.dsred <dig> construct conferred resistance to hygromycin while plko.egfp.dsred <dig> expressed egfp . furthermore, all h6c <dig> dsred <dig> derived cell lines were positive for red fluorescence suggesting that dsred <dig> could be successfully overexpressed using any of our destination vectors . the infection of h6c <dig> dsred <dig> derivatives using adeno-cre significantly reduced the expression of dsred <dig> as measured by red <dig> fluorescence .

viral titer of destination vectors is dependent on the insert size
it has been demonstrated that lentiviral titer depends greatly on the insert sequence length due to the packaging capacity of the lentivirus  <cit> . as a result multiple strategies have been employed over years to increase the viral titers of pseudotyped lentiviruses especially for gene therapy applications  <cit> . in order to fully characterize the efficacy of our expression system, we tested the viral titer of plko.yfp.dest expressing genes of various sizes in 293t cells . as predicted, our results showed that the viral titer is proportional to the insert size . although a destination vector with a large cdna such as htert resulted ultimately in lower lentiviral titer, it did not impede the ability to efficiently overexpress the gene in stable h6c <dig> cell line . furthermore, it has been shown previously that low titer virus results in unprocessed and defective lentiviruses  <cit> . however, in our experiments, all yfp positive cells clearly overexpressed functional htert gene as determined by the htert activity assay . since the chance of vector integration event using non-viral expression system is generally very low, the use of low titer lentiviruses might still remain a better choice when creating stable cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS
versatile gene/shrna expression system is a necessity in gene functional studies. we have created a modified gateway lentiviral system for shrna and cre/lox inducible gene expression with entry and destination vectors that are compatible with existing gateway technologies. these reagents should provide additional choices for researchers studying many aspects of functional genomics.
