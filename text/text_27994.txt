BACKGROUND
rice  is a major food crop for more than half of the global population, although it experiences various biotic and abiotic stresses throughout its life cycle. sheath blight is considered to be an important disease of rice next to the blast disease. it is caused by a cosmopolitan, soil-borne basidiomycete necrotrophic fungus rhizoctonia solani kühn . sheath blight results in severe damage and reduces the rice yield by 8–50 % in the rice-growing countries of asia  <cit> . in india, it causes about 20 % loss of rice yield  <cit> . moreover, the damage caused by sheath blight has become more alarming nowadays, due to the increased use of semi-dwarf, nitrogen-responsive and high-yielding varieties  <cit> . it is difficult to manage sheath blight because of the wide host range of this pathogen, high pathogenic diversity and its ability to survive in soil for a long time  <cit> . in addition, attempts to control sheath blight through conventional breeding are not possible as there is no such records of genetic resistance to sheath blight among cultivars and wild races of rice  <cit> . application of fungicide is a common practice to control plant diseases. control through chemical methods significantly increases production cost and poses serious health and environmental threats. in addition, the emergence of fungicide-resistant pathogens demands effective antifungal candidate genes.

in view of the above, the introduction of antifungal genes into rice cultivars may be the suitable method for the fight against sheath blight. till date, an array of antifungal proteins has been biotechnologically exploited to generate transgenic plants conferring resistance to sheath blight, including chitinases  thaumatin-like proteins  <cit>  nonspecific lipid transfer proteins  <cit>  and plant defensin  <cit> .

lectins are carbohydrate-binding, heterologous group of proteins that bind reversibly to specific mono-or oligosaccharides, possessing at least one non-catalytic domain  <cit> . in plant-pathogen interactions, plant lectins provide plants with a passive defense system against various pathogens by their ability to bind to specific carbohydrates  <cit> . several plant lectins have been exploited to develop insect resistant plants  and few lectins are reported to manifest antifungal activity . allium sativum leaf agglutinin  is a mannose-binding 25-kda homodimeric lectin, isolated from garlic  leaves and showed potent insecticidal activity against homopteran pests . a stable monomeric mutant variant of allium sativum leaf agglutinin  was generated by radically changing the oligomerization level of asal by the insertion and replacement of five amino acid residues . interestingly, this 12-kda mutant asal exhibits an in vitro antifungal activity against a broad spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi including r. solani  <cit> .

the exact mode of action of masal on r. solani is not clear, however, its antifungal activity was found to be associated with the alteration of cell membrane permeability of the fungus  <cit> . in addition, a ligand blot assay of total protein from r. solani with masal detected the presence of several interactors. hence, binding of masal with the interactors is assumed to have an adverse influence on the different key metabolic pathways of r. solani  <cit> .

nevertheless, there is a growing concern among the scientific community as well as among consumers regarding the risk of allergenicity induced by any foreign or engineered protein expressed in genetically modified plants. thus, while targeting any new genes in crop plants, the possibility of allergenicity and toxicity associated with the gene product must be considered. so, both in vitro and in vivo safety assessment of masal was performed following the fao/who guidelines   <cit> . the results revealed that masal appears to be safe and poses no unfavourable features towards model animals and humans in terms of toxicity and allergenicity  <cit> . in view of the strong antifungal activity as well as biosafety, masal stands out to be a promising candidate for engineering agronomically important crop plants. in this study, we report the stable transformation of an elite indica rice, ir- <dig>  with the antifungal gene masal. our results showed that in planta expression of masal significantly improved resistance to sheath blight in comparison to wild-type rice plants.

RESULTS
development of masal expressing transgenic plants
the plant expression cassette comprising cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter, a 333 bp masal coding sequence and a nos terminator was cloned into hindiii/ecori site of pcambia <dig>  the recombinant clone was designated pcambia1301masal  and used in plant transformation for the constitutive expression of masal. the resulting plasmid was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens  for the genetic transformation experiments. the indica rice cv. ir <dig> has been used in the present study for developing transgenic rice plants. preliminary screening of the randomly selected ten t <dig> transformants, regenerated from hygromycin resistant calli, was performed by pcr amplification of the masal gene. pcr analysis from the untransformed plants  showed no amplification while an amplified fragment of ~333 bp was detected in transformed leaf samples . a total of six independently transformed hygromycin resistant, pcr positive t <dig> plants  were grown and multiplied to t <dig> plants for further analyses. all of these transformed plants were morphologically similar to the non-transformed controls with respect to the vegetative growth, flowering and seed setting.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the t-dna segment of plant expression vector. camv35spr., cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter; camv35s polya, cauliflower mosaic virus 35s terminator; masal, mutant allium sativum leaf agglutinin; hptii, hygromycin phosphotransferase ii; gus, β-glucuronidase; nos polya, nopaline synthase terminator; lb, left border of t-dna; rb, right border of t-dna

stable integration and inheritance of masal gene
after selfing, seeds were collected from six independent t <dig> plants. the integration of the transgene, in pcr positive t <dig> lines, were confirmed by southern blot hybridization. genomic dna was extracted from t <dig> progenies of respective t <dig> plants and digested with hindiii, as there is only a single hindiii site at the 5’ end of the masal gene cassette. after hybridization using radiolabelled masal specific gene probe, all the lines documented different banding patterns, suggesting the independent integration event in each line. plant number rsr <dig> , rsr <dig> , rsr <dig> , rsr <dig>  and rsr <dig>  showed a single copy of transgene insertion and one plant  did not show any integration . rsr <dig>  was further analyzed in the next generation. four t <dig> progenies of rsr <dig>  demonstrated that the integration patterns were same as the parental line . further analyses were carried out with plants having single copy insertions. pcr screening for masal gene using dna isolated from randomly chosen t <dig> seedlings demonstrated that segregation of the masal gene followed 3: <dig> mendelian segregation pattern and the observed ratio was validated using χ <dig> test .fig.  <dig> southern blot analysis of the pcr positive t <dig> and t <dig> transformants. a southern blot analysis of hindiii digested genomic dna from leaves of six individual t <dig> progeny plants of corresponding t <dig> lines  in lanes 3– <dig>  respectively; lane  <dig>  rsr <dig>  a segregating progeny showing absence of masal gene cassette. b southern blot analysis of hindiii digested genomic dna from leaves of four t <dig> progenies of rsr <dig>  plant in lanes 3– <dig>  respectively. masal gene was used as positive control  and hindiii digested genomic dna from control plants as negative control . approximate dna molecular weight markers are indicated on the left

expression of masal in transgenic rice
western blot analysis clearly indicated the presence of ~12-kda band of expressed masal protein separated in 15 % sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  when probed with the anti-masal polyclonal antibody. no such band was observed in the untransformed control plants. all of the six t <dig> progeny plants and their corresponding t <dig> parental lines were able to express the ~12-kda masal protein . the amount of masal in leaves of t <dig> and t <dig> rice plants was quantified using indirect elisa . expression levels ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of total soluble protein, in the leaf extracts of transgenic lines.fig.  <dig> detection of masal in transgenic rice. a western blot analysis of total protein extracts isolated from the leaves of 35smasal, six independent t <dig> transgenic rice lines  and b six t <dig> progeny plants of rsr <dig> , rsr <dig>  and rsr <dig>  . lane  <dig>  purified masal; lane  <dig>  protein extract from untransformed control plant. c elisa analysis for expression of masal in total soluble protein in six t <dig> transformants  and d in six t <dig> progeny plants of line rsr <dig> , rsr <dig> , and rsr <dig> . the bars represent the mean elisa reading of three replicas per sample of three experiments



immunohistofluorescence localization of masal in transgenic plants
immunohistofluorescence analysis of expressed masal was studied by treating transverse sections of both untransformed and transformed rice stems, leaves and roots with the anti-masal primary antibody, followed by fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit igg. untransformed plants were used as negative control. untransformed and transformed plant sections were processed in the same manner. fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the constitutive expression of masal in all tissue types of stem, root and leaf sections of transgenic rice plants as depicted in fig. 5d, e and f, respectively. whereas, the untransformed plants showed no fluorescence after treatment with the antibodies .fig.  <dig> immunohistoflourescence localization of masal in transgenic rice. transverse sections were prepared from tissues of masal expressing transgenic lines and control untransformed plants. panels a, b and c represent the transverse sections of leaf, stem and root of control plants. panels d, e and f represent the transverse sections of leaf, stem and root of masal expressing transgenic lines. tissue sections were treated with anti-masal anti-serum as primary antibody and fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit igg as secondary antibody. the presence of masal is indicated by the green fluorescence. bar represents 10 μm



assessment of disease tolerance of transgenic rice
to determine the functional relevance of masal expression in rice, transgenic rice plants were tested for resistance against a virulent strain of r. solani ag-1-1a. detached leaf bioassay with r. solani, showed sheath blight symptoms appeared within 48 h after inoculation  with yellowing of margins surrounding the area of inoculum in untransformed control leaves. the lesion was found to extend progressively at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. in contrast, leaves of transgenic plants almost remained green and fresh with respect to the non-transgenic control; where minimal yellowing of leaves was observed at  <dig> and  <dig> hai .fig.  <dig> assessment of sheath blight resistance by detached leaf bioassay. a representative images of the lesion formation in leaves of non-transgenic control and transgenic lines  following inoculation with r. solani at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hai, respectively. b photomicrograph of a portion of trypan blue stained control and transgenic leaf at  <dig> hai showing infection cushions. magnification bar represents 20 μm. c graphical representation of number of infection cushions in control and transgenic plants  at  <dig> hai. each data point represents the average of three individual measurements with standard deviations as error bars



in addition, to substantiate the results of detached leaf bioassay, trypan blue staining and microscopic observations of r. solani hyphae were carried out at  <dig> hai using a light microscope. extensive colonization of fungal hyphae, forming prominent infection cushions was observed in the leaves of control wild-type plants. in contrast, under the same experimental conditions, no such intensive fungal colonization was observed in the leaves of masal expressing plants at  <dig> hai . transgenic plants were further evaluated by comparing the number of infection cushions in the leaves of transgenic and non-transgenic control plants. this indicated a prominent reduction in the number of infection cushion in the transgenic lines with respect to the non-transgenic control plants .

to further validate the results obtained by using the detached leaf bioassay, in planta inoculation experiments were carried out. the progression of sheath blight infection in the control plant in comparison to the transgenic lines at 7 days post-inoculation , is shown in fig. 7a. the transgenic lines exhibited a delayed symptoms appearance and reduced disease intensity compared to that of the control plants. in the whole plant bioassay, the masal expressing transgenic lines recorded a lower percentage disease index  compared with the control plants. the pdi was scored after first, second and third weeks after r. solani infection in the control and the transgenic t <dig> plants  . the pdi in the control plants, which was  <dig>  after week one, progressed to  <dig>  and  <dig>  after second and third weeks, respectively. the pdi of the t <dig> transgenic plants , which was in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  in the first week, changed from the range of  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig> – <dig>  in the second and third weeks, respectively, after infection. thus, the pdi of the transgenic lines were significantly lower than the control at all the three-time points .fig.  <dig> resistance in transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing masal. a representative images showing whole plant infection assay of control and transgenic plants at 7dpi. m, negative control without r. solani inoculam; c, untransformed plant infected with r. solani;  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> are infected transgenic plants of the lines rsr <dig>  rsr <dig>  and rsr <dig>  respectively. each plant represents the infected portion of one representative tiller from each transgenic line. b response of transgenic lines and non-transgenic control to the sheath blight infection was scored as the relative lesion height and expressed as the percentage disease index  in transgenic line and wild-type plants. the values were shown as the mean ± standard error . individual tillers were considered as separate replications. data sets were analyzed for significant difference using anova 



discussion
engineering fungal resistance in plants is a promising strategy in terms of cost, efficacy and sole dependence on pesticides. in this study, masal was selected as it was found to exhibit strong antifungal activity against r. solani  <cit> . furthermore, the safety evaluation also indicated that masal does not pose a risk of food allergy  <cit> . masal was engineered into rice through agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol to monitor its efficacy against sheath blight. gus-positive, putatively transformants, regenerated from the hygromycin resistant calli were subjected to molecular analyses. pcr analysis using masal specific primers showed amplification at ~333 bp region in six transformants, confirming the integration of the gene. none of the transgenic lines showed any phenotypic alteration.

multiple copies of a transgene inserted in single or multiple loci often lead to the problems of co-suppression, silencing, sterility, non-mendelian inheritance of transgene and instability over generations  <cit> . thus, single copy integration of transgene is always preferred to achieve predictable patterns of transgene inheritance and to overcome the problem of gene silencing in transgenic plants  <cit> . it was reported previously that the use of multicopy binary vectors may integrate multiple copies of t-dna into the plant genome, which had a propensity for silencing to a greater extent than do the single integrated copies  <cit> . therefore, the use of multicopy binary vectors introduced two common problems associated with plant transformation, multiple integrated transgene copy number and vector backbone integration. nowadays, low-copy-number t-dna binary vectors are being used to eliminate these problems  <cit> . the correlation between the transgene copy and the level of gene expression is known to be complex. some reports showed that the transgene copy number is inversely correlated to the expression levels  <cit> . to simplify the transgenic analysis and to validate the true transgenic nature of the primary transformants, the inheritance of masal gene was analyzed by southern blot hybridization in stringently selected t <dig> plants and their t <dig> progenies. southern blot analysis with the masal probe, in hindiii digested genomic dna of transformants revealed the stable integration of masal in different transgenic lines. five out of six independent transgenic events representing the randomly selected t <dig> progeny plants of corresponding t <dig> lines showed single copy integration. one of the representative progeny plant i.e. t <dig>  of the corresponding rsr <dig> t <dig> line did not show the integration of masal gene cassette. this could be due to the segregation of the transgene in t <dig> generation. one of the lines  was further analysed for the inheritance of the masal in t <dig> generation through southern blot hybridization, which showed that copy number of transgene integration among the t <dig> plants was identical to their parental line. this suggests that no rearrangement of the masal gene has occurred during the segregation. furthermore, the chi-square analysis was conducted for testing the segregation of transgene in t <dig> generation. this revealed that the observed ratio fits well to the expected 3: <dig> ratio.

the expression of masal in the transgenic lines t <dig> and t <dig> was analyzed by western blot analysis and indirect elisa. western blot analysis of the transgenic lines confirmed the constitutive and stable expression of masal. elisa was carried out to monitor the quantitative expression of masal in t <dig> and t <dig> plants. the expression level ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of total soluble protein, in different transformants, which suggests that the transgene has integrated randomly at different transcriptionally active sites within the plant genome. the immunohistoflourescence localization revealed that masal was strongly expressed in various plant parts like stems, leaves and roots. however, the constitutive expression of transgenes may increase the metabolic load and the energy cost of the transgenic plants. therefore, to avoid the unwanted expression of the target gene in non-target organs and tissues and to reduce the severity of sheath blight infection, it is highly desirable to express the target genes at the specific site of infection.

we further assessed the efficacy of masal on rice against sheath blight. both the detached leaf and whole plant bioassay showed that masal-expressing transgenic rice exhibited significant resistance to sheath blight. the inhibitory effect of masal in infection cushions formation at  <dig> hai can be directly correlated with the expression level of masal in the three transgenic lines . in addition, in the whole plant bioassay the two transgenic lines  exhibited the variation between the degree of sheath blight resistance and the expression levels of masal at  <dig>   <dig> and 21dpi. however, a direct correlation with the expression of masal was observed in the transgenic line  at the above three time points.

the three masal expressing transgenic t <dig> lines  exhibited enhanced resistance. unlike the larger lesions of non-transgenic leaves, the transgenic leaves documented the formation of defensive yellowing at the site of inoculation. the infection cushion plays a crucial role in the disease progression by enzymatic degradation and physical penetration through the leaf surface  <cit> . interestingly, strong support of resistance to sheath blight was evident from the growth suppression and reduction in the number of infection cushions observed in the leaf surface of transgenic lines. earlier reports also showed suppression of fungal invasive hyphae in transgenic rice expressing antifungal proteins  <cit> . definitive proof of sheath blight resistance came from the whole plant bioassay, which was performed according to park et al.  <cit> . upon inoculation with r. solani, the masal expressing transgenic lines recorded a lower pdi as compared to that in the control. in transgenic plants, sheath blight symptoms development was delayed, and small brownish lesions started appearing on  <dig> dpi. the delayed occurrence and relatively slow enlargement of lesions coupled with extensive browning  around the lesions in transgenic plants suggest enhanced resistance against r. solani. on average, a 55 % reduction in the pdi in masal expressing plants relative to non-transgenic plants was observed. in the present study, the reduction in the average pdi was more or less comparable, or higher than the previous reports. a 25 % reduction in disease severity was observed in transgenic rice co-expressing ribosome-inactivating protein and a rice chitinase relative to the control plants  <cit> . in another report, a 45 % reduction in disease symptoms was observed in transgenic rice expressing rs-afp <dig> defensin gene  <cit> . more or less 50 % reduction in the pdi was observed in osoxo4-overexpressing plants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study highlights the efficacy of masal against r. solani by developing masal expressing transgenic rice plants. the selected transgenic lines displayed an improved resistance to sheath blight. therefore, the use of this novel antifungal gene may appear as a promising strategy for future management of other fungal pathogens. additional research is also needed to focus on the overall analysis of masal expressing plants in terms of agronomic traits and monitoring its efficacy against greater diversity of pathogens under natural field conditions.
