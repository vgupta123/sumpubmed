BACKGROUND
dengue virus , a member of the flaviviridae family, is the most prevalent arbovirus in more than  <dig> countries within tropical and subtropical regions of the world  <cit> . there are four distinct serotypes, described as denv <dig>  denv <dig>  denv <dig>  and denv <dig>  <cit> . denv infection causes dengue fever, the more dangerous dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, all of which are very contagious  <cit> . according to a world health organization report, there are  <dig> million denv infections and  <dig>  cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever annually, the latter requiring hospitalization  <cit> . in  <dig>  there was an outbreak of dengue fever in china and countries within southeast asia, with more than  <dig>  denv-infected people in southern china. denv infections are not only a threat to human health, but also cause huge economic losses to society.

the clinical characteristics of primary denv do not involve bleeding or shock, and induce a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype responsible for the infection  <cit> . because of antibody-dependent enhancement  <cit> , upon reinfection with a different denv serotype, antibodies against the virus are able to form a type of immune complex that activates the complement system resulting in immunopathologies  <cit> , such as the pathogenesis of dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. without an effective vaccine to prevent denv infection, multiple and sequential infections with denv1- <dig> are to be expected for people living in regions where dengue is hyperendemic  <cit> .therefore, rapid detection and differentiation of denv serotypes are crucial for effective clinical diagnosis as well as for epidemiological investigation of this pathogen.

early and rapid detection of denv infection during the acute phase of illness are crucial for proper patient management and preventing the spread of infection. for microbiological diagnosis of denv, several techniques have been developed; these include virus isolation, immunoassays, and biochemical tests using nucleotide probes . virus isolation is the “gold standard” for denv detection. however, it is laborious and time consuming when used for routine clinical examination of patients. the presence of cross-reactive antigens shared by flaviviruses makes specific diagnosis of denv by immunoassay not possible in most cases. furthermore, because the antibodies produced in response to the virus do not occur at an early stage of the infection, the immunoassay methods are not suitable for early diagnosis. nucleic acid detection is deemed to be a timely and effective method for diagnosis of denv infection. reverse transcriptase -pcr and real-time pcr methods have both been used widely for laboratory diagnosis because of their high sensitivities and specificities  <cit> . however, they require specialized equipment, which restricts the popularization of this approach . hence, there is great demand for a rapid, simple, convenient, and appropriate method for use in resource-poor health clinics.

loop-mediated isothermal amplification , developed by notomi in  <dig>  can achieve fast amplification of nucleic acid using only a water bath or heating block  <cit> . this method is a promising tool to meet the increasing need for a fast and easily performable pathogen detection assay  <cit> . lamp can be used to determine the sex of animals  <cit> , and establish if a food has been genetically modified  <cit> . reverse transcriptase lamp , which is based on amplification of reverse-transcribed cdna, has the same sensitivity of dna amplification by the standard lamp method  <cit> . this method has been adopted for detecting various viruses , especially for detecting viruses that cause similar symptoms in a host and share a high degree of nucleotide homology among them  <cit> . disappointingly, because of its high sensitivity, rt-lamp is easily affected by aerosol pollution thereby resulting in false-positive samples. the need to prevent aerosol generation is of paramount importance when using rt-lamp.

early reports of denv1- <dig> detection by rt-lamp involved small numbers  of clinical samples, use of the c-prm gene  <cit> , serotype-specific regions of the 3′ untranslated region of the same gene  <cit> , or the non-structural protein  <dig>   <cit> . however, use of the same gene is not the best choice for all denv1- <dig> genotypes because there may be high sequence identity among genotypes with the same serotype but low sequence variability among the four serotypes; this situation is relevant for the c-prm gene, its 3′-utr  <cit> , and ns <dig>  <cit> . the detection limits for denv1- <dig> differ and the diagnostic accuracy was < 90 % because the denv1- <dig> primers were limited to the same gene in earlier reports. moreover, the aerosol pollution problem had not been solved in earlier reports. these deficiencies have hindered promotion of rt-lamp for the detection of denv.

in this study, a denv1-4-specific rt-lamp assay was developed and evaluated using serum from patients with denv infections. the results showed that the rt-lamp assay was specific, sensitive, and accurate. with new equipment and a method that avoids aerosol pollution, rt-lamp has the potential to become a useful and reliable method for clinical diagnostics of denv, especially in hospitals and laboratories that lack sophisticated diagnostic systems.

sensitivity assessment of rt-lamp for denv1-4
the sensitivity of the rt-lamp method for the detection denv1- <dig> was determined by testing 10-fold serially diluted viral genomic rna templates with known numbers of nucleic acid copies, and comparing the assay with those of rt-pcr and real-time pcr. as a consequence, positive results for the rt-lamp assay were detected at 10-copy templates of denv1- <dig> , while the detection limits for rt-pcr and real-time pcr were about  <dig> copies . thus, the detection sensitivity of the rt-lamp assay for amplification of denv1- <dig> was 10-fold more sensitive than those of rt-pcr and real-time pcr.fig.  <dig> comparison of the sensitivity of rt-pcr, real-time pcr and rt-lamp for detection of denv <dig>  a agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of detection limit of the rt-pcr assay for the detection of denv <dig> rna. b the real-time monitoring over time for detection limit of the real-time pcr assay for the detection of the denv <dig> cdnas. c agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the detection limit of the rt-lamp assay for the detection of denv <dig> rna d visual inspection of the rt-lamp assay corresponding to agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. e the real-time monitoring of detection limit of the rt-lamp assay.  <dig>  negative  <cit> ; 2– <dig>  correspond to serial ten-fold dilutions of denv <dig> rna templates from  <dig> to 105copies; m, dl <dig> dna marker

amplification efficiency of rt-lamp for denv1-4
rt-lamp products were detected by monitoring the increase in fluorescence by adding sybr green i to the rt-lamp reaction mix. quantitative analysis was obtained by measuring the time-to-positive  parameter  <cit> , a biomarker similar to the cycle threshold of real-time pcr  <cit> . the standard curves were generated by linear regression analysis of ttp for rt-lamp and the ct of real-time pcr for each amplification reaction versus the log <dig> rna copy number . additionally, the time taken for fluorescence signal detection for each rt-lamp and real-time pcr amplification was calculated according to ttp or ct, respectively, after which the standard curves were generated by linear regression analysis . the time required by rt-lamp was about half of that required by real-time pcr for every diluted concentration of denv rna, and the time required by the other serotypes was similar . rt-lamp was able to detect 10-copies of denv rna in 20 min, which should fit the requirement for rapid clinical diagnosis of denv.fig.  <dig> comparison of the amplification efficiency and time of real-time pcr and rt-lamp. a standard curves generated by linear regression analysis of ttp of lamp and ct of real-time pcr measured for each amplification versus the log <dig> number of denv- <dig> rna or cdna copies for each standard dilution. b standard curves generated by linear regression analysis of the time for each amplification versus the log <dig> number of denv- <dig> rna or cdna copies each standard dilution. data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean  at least three independent experiments. ct, cycle threshold; ttp, time-to-positive



evaluation of rt-lamp for clinical diagnosis of denv1-4
the applicability of the rt-lamp assay for detection and differentiation of denv serotypes was validated by evaluating clinical strains of the virus and patient serum with denv infection. twenty clinical strains of denv <dig>   <dig> clinical strains of denv <dig>   <dig> clinical strains of denv <dig> and  <dig> clinical strains of denv <dig>  were examined by the rt-lamp assay, rt-pcr, and real-time pcr. as a result, the denv1- <dig> detection rates had up to 100 % accuracy for rt-lamp and real-time pcr, compared with 93 % by rt-pcr . no cross-reactions between the serotypes were identified in this study.table  <dig> comparative evaluation of denv serotype-specific rt-lamp assay with rt-pcr, and real-time pcr for detection of denv stains and the patients’ serum samples



for the study on patient serum,  <dig> serum samples from patients confirmed to be infected by denv by clinical diagnosis were treated to extract the total rna. additionally,  <dig> serum samples from healthy volunteers received the same treatment . among the positive samples,  <dig>  %  were rt-lamp assay positive, a value higher than  <dig>  %  with rt-pcr and  <dig>  %  with real-time pcr , thus indicating that the sensitivity of the rt-amp assay is higher than that of rt-pcr  and that of real-time pcr . none of the  <dig> healthy blood donors were positive for dengue viruses, as determined by the three methods. no cross-reactions or false-positive reactions were noted.

discussion
denv is the most widely prevalent arbovirus in tropical and subtropical regions of the world  <cit> . there is an urgent need for fast and accurate clinical diagnosis and serotype differentiation of denv1- <dig> to prevent and treat this viral infection. conventional methods of denv detection, which include virus isolation, immunoassay, rt-pcr, and real-time pcr  <cit> , have many drawbacks in that they are time consuming to perform, require special equipment, and have a high propensity for cross-reaction of the denv1- <dig> serotypes. in contrast, rt-lamp can be performed using a water bath or a heating block under isothermal conditions  <cit> , and is more sensitive and faster to perform than the other methods described herein. some studies have reported the use of rt-lamp for analyzing denv. however, the detection limits for the denv1- <dig> serotypes differed from each other and the diagnostic accuracy was < 90 % because the denv1- <dig> primers were restricted to the same gene in the earlier reports , although they could detect and differentiate denv1- <dig> isotypes. in our study, we did not restrict the design of the primers to the same gene, but allowed different genes to be included in the search for optimal sequences with which to differentiate the different viral serotypes using multiple sequence alignments. this approach allowed us to establish an rt-lamp method for detection of denv 1– <dig> with higher sensitivity and greater diagnostic potential than rt-pcr and real-time pcr. the rt-lamp reaction was sensitive enough to detect 10-copies of rna template unlike rt-pcr and real-time pcr that each had detection limits of  <dig> copies. scientific literature searches show that several studies have reported a higher sensitivity for real-time pcr than rt-pcr, but the detection limits of rt-pcr and real-time pcr can be discrepant in different detection systems, although both methods could detect  <dig> copies of denv , which is consistent with our results.

in our diagnostic testing of the viral clinical strains and patients with denv infections, the diagnostic rate rt-lamp achieved was 100 % for the viral strains and  <dig>  % for the patient samples, both values of which are better than that of rt-pcr  and real-time pcr . encouragingly, the time required for confirmation of the results by the rt-lamp assay was less than 25 min, just half of the time required by real-time pcr.

because of its high sensitivity, rt-lamp is more easily affected by aerosol pollution, a disadvantage ignored in previous studies. to avoid contamination, the tubes used for rt-lamp reactions should not be opened; however, it is not feasible to add the sybr green i to the tube directly before the start of the lamp reaction because a high concentration of sybr green i can inhibit this reaction  <cit> . therefore, in our study, to avoid aerosol pollution, the sybr green i was dispensed directly onto the inner cover of the reaction tube. after the reaction was completed, the sybr green i was mixed with the rt-lamp reaction mix by centrifugation. furthermore, a new fluorescence-real time-monitoring instrument, ese  was used to eliminate aerosol pollution; this enabled the real-time monitoring of the rt-lamp amplification to be realized using matched software. the risk of false-positives caused by aerosol contamination was minimized by using the improved methods and new equipment.

CONCLUSIONS
the rt-lamp method we established in this study is rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection and differentiation of denv1- <dig> serotypes. with new equipment and the application of our method to avoid aerosol contamination of the samples, the rt-lamp method has potential for use in clinical laboratories where denv assays are repeated many times. moreover, it is convenient to quantitatively detect denv1- <dig> by monitoring the fluorescence of the rt-lamp reaction or by visually assessing the reaction using sybr green i for different requirements and test conditions.
