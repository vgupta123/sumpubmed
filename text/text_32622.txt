BACKGROUND
wild ancestors of the pig  are still alive, providing an excellent model for tracing their evolutionary history and for defining the evolutionary mechanism driven by artificial selection during domestication  <cit> . pigs were first domesticated approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the domestication of pigs occurred independently in various parts of the word  <cit>  and historically, europe and china are the two major areas of pig breeding  <cit> . more than  <dig> pig breeds or lines have undergone natural and artificial selection in different environments, especially catering to the distinct needs of humans, which has provided the large diversity of morphological and physiological characteristics that currently exist worldwide  <cit> . for example, the lean and muscular landrace  type in europe and the high fat deposition and thin muscle fibers of the lantang  type in china  <cit> . the lean  and obese  pig breeds have been found to have significant differences in their genetic of muscle growth rate and fatness  <cit> . lde is characterized by a high lean meat percentage, fast-growing muscle and high body weight  <cit> , while lt, an obese pig breed indigenous to china, is characterized by high intramuscular fat content, slow-growing muscle, and low body weight  <cit> . significant genome and transcriptome differences have been revealed by comparative genomic studies  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying the morphological variations in muscle among pig breeds are still unclear. generally, it is has been reported that changes in gene expression and regulatory interaction networks rather than genetic changes that result in changes to the amino acid sequences of proteins that account for the phenotype differences among species  <cit> . therefore, the identification of gene expression regulatory networks in pig breeds with distinct muscle phenotypes is necessary to understand how muscle has been modified during pig domestication.

strong selective pressures though the artificial selection of domestication have caused rapid phenotype evolution and major changes in the morphological architectures of pig muscle  <cit> . the lde and lt breeds, which have distinct muscle phenotypes, were domesticated under different breeding goals in europe and asia  <cit> . thus, artificial selection was probably critical in modifying the gene expression regulatory networks that resulted in muscle phenotype divergence. to better understand gene expression network differences in muscle development between the lde and lt breeds, we applied a global network approach using weighted gene coexpression network analysis   <cit> . wgcna elucidates the higher-order relationships between groups of genes coexpressed with high topological overlap across samples, which are termed “modules”. a module is a pairwise measure of the similarity of the coexpression relationships of two genes with all other genes in a network. the topological overlap of paired proteins in gene coexpression networks was significantly higher for physically interacting protein pairs compared with pairs that did not interact. thus, wgcna screens for the core functional units of transcriptional networks. wgcna also identifies the statistical significant enrichments of genes with the highest degree of connectivity within each module, referred to as “hub genes”. hub genes are expected to play critical roles in the coexpression network of each module  <cit> . thus, a comprehensive analysis of gene coexpression relationships in different muscle phenotypes provides an efficient way of exploring the genetic basis of phenotype variation. in this way, we used this approach to identify and visualize modules of coexpressed genes, which were organized into modules of coexpressed genes with clear functional interpretations, and to explore module differences between breeds. we identified modules of coexpressed genes, which corresponded to muscle phenotypes, and determined the hub genes responsible for the key functional distinctions between breeds. our results demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying phenotype divergence between breeds cannot be robustly explained by differential gene expression alone but can be explained by coexpression network modules. we also showed that muscle phenotype differences between the lde and lt breeds were not regulated by the muscle genes alone but by the coordinated action of muscle, nerve, and immunity genes. thus, our results indicated that the regulation of muscle development were more complex than previously acknowledged. the evolutionary rates of most modules were accelerated, implying that complex species-specific coexpression networks underlie artificial selection during domestication. these findings are important in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie muscle development and phenotype variation, and reveal the potential impact of evolutionary changes at the coexpression network level.

RESULTS
gene coexpression networks in lean and obese pig muscle
to investigate coexpression networks that comprehensively represent muscle transcription during pig development, we constructed gene coexpression networks from  <dig> next-generation sequencing data sets generated by solexa/illumina’s genome sequencing technology  <cit> . the  <dig> data sets comprised  <dig> lt and  <dig> lde data sets, each of which contained muscle transcriptomes data at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  91 days post-coitus and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  180 days post-natum  <cit> . the gene expression levels in each sample were assessed using 3’ digital gene expression tag-based profiling  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> temporally differentially expressed genes  were identified during lt prenatal and postnatal muscle development, respectively. similarly,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified from lde prenatal and postnatal muscle, respectively. weighted pearson correlations were calculated for all  <dig> and  <dig> degs in lt, and for all  <dig> and  <dig> degs in lde. all the weighted pearson correlations were converted into matrices of connection strength by a power function  <cit> . the topological overlaps between genes were then calculated using these connection strengths. topological overlaps values were used to assess the similarity of the coexpression relationship of two genes with all the other genes in the network in a robust and biologically meaningful way  <cit> . average linkage hierarchical clustering was used to cluster coexpressed genes with similar patterns of connection strengths or with high topological overlaps into modules. in all, we identified  <dig> modules in the lde prenatal network ,  <dig> in the lde postnatal network ,  <dig> in the lt prenatal network  and  <dig> in the lt postnatal network  .figure  <dig>

coexpression network modules between lean and obese breeds are more different in postnatal animals than in prenatal animals
to determine the preservation of coexpression network modules between different muscle types, we assessed whether different modules were composed of the same genes on a module-by-module basis. a high degree of module preservation between the prenatal animals was observed by calculating the overlap for each possible pair of modules . two pairs of modules were deemed to show significant preservation when the gene coexpression relationships were > 50% overlap. in the lt-turquoise and lde-turquoise module pair , we identified about  <dig> overlapping genes: 47%  in lde-turquoise; and 72%  in lt-turquoise. in the lt-blue and lde-brown module pair , we identified about  <dig> overlapping genes: 38%  in lt-blue and 56%  in lde-brown. overalll, these two coexpression network modules with  <dig> genes  were highly preserved in the lt and lde prenatal animals . the gene ontology  annotations assigned to the genes indicated that most of the  <dig> genes were involved in cell differentiation and growth, muscle and skeletal system development, neuron development, and cellular response . because the “hub genes” have the highest degree of within-module connectivity, they were expected to play critical roles in the coexpression network modules and were therefore considered to be a primary indicator of the module function  <cit> . we identified the hub genes by visualizing the preserved coexpression network modules . in the blue-brown module , the hub genes included smn <dig>  which has been shown to be crucial in neurite outgrowth and neuromuscular maturation during the differentiation and development of neurons and muscle  <cit> ; gnb2l <dig>  <cit>  and sbds  <cit> , which may be involved in cell division and growth ; and elof <dig>  a conserved transcription elongation factor  <cit> . in the turquoise-turquoise module , the hub genes included hoxb <dig>  hey <dig> and pbx <dig>  which have been reported to regulate muscle development  <cit> ; and mpped <dig> and nefl, which may play roles in neuronal differentiation  <cit> . between the postnatal animals the degree of module preservation was much lower than was found between the prenatal pigs. indeed, only two modules containing a total of  <dig> genes  were common between the lt and lde postnatal animals . thus, the coexpression network modules were more conserved in prenatal than in postnatal animals, and muscle related genes were found to play key roles in most of the preserved coexpression network modules.figure  <dig>

differences in prenatal modules between lean and obese breeds provide insight into prenatal muscle development differences in fiber number and muscle fiber composition
differences in transcriptional levels are important for studying the evolutionary basis of phenotypic differences at the molecular level  <cit> . differences in network modules could provide a basis for better understanding of the differences in muscle development between lean and obese pigs. in this study, we identified six highly lean-specific modules and five highly obese-specific modules in the prenatal animals . a go analysis of these module genes revealed that nine of these modules were involved in muscle development, neuron development and cellular response . hub genes involved in muscle development were enriched in six lean-specific modules  and in three obese-specific modules  . the hub genes in the lt-dark red module were significantly enriched for genes involved in cellular response . overall, a greater number of muscle development-related modules that regulate fiber number and muscle fiber composition were identified in lean lde animals than in obese lt animals.figure  <dig>

differences in postnatal modules between lean and obese breeds provide insight into differences in postnatal muscle growth and fat deposition
only two modules were common between lean and obese postnatal animals; however, about  <dig> highly lean-specific modules and  <dig> highly obese-specific modules were identified . go analysis of these module genes revealed that  <dig> of these modules were involved in muscle development, neuron development, and cellular response, and three were enriched in cellular response and metabolism . hub genes involved in muscle development were enriched in  <dig> lean-specific modules . the hub genes in the lde-black module were significantly enriched for genes involved in the regulation of alternative splicing  . in addition,  <dig> muscle development hub genes were identified in the  <dig> obese-specific modules . in particular, hub genes involved in intramuscular fat deposition and meat quality were significantly enriched in five obese-specific modules  . thus, difference between lean- and obese- specific modules in the postnatal animals provided insights into differences in postnatal muscle growth and fat deposition in the lt and lde pigs.figure  <dig>

regulation of muscle development is coordinated by muscle, nerve, and immunity genes
among the  <dig> modules mentioned above ,  <dig> contained genes related to muscle development, nervous system development, and immune response, seven contained genes related to muscle development and immune response, and another three contained genes related to muscle development and nervous system development . many neuron and immune response genes played crucial roles in the coexpression network modules of muscle . this finding suggests that the regulation of muscle development might be more complex than previously acknowledged, because our results suggest that the muscle development process may be regulated not only by muscle genes but by the coordinated action of muscle, nerve, and immunity genes.

detection of positive selection pressure
to examine the genes that showed accelerated evolution in the  <dig> modules, we obtained the ortholog sequences of the  <dig> genes in these modules from whole-genome resequencing data of  <dig> individual pigs and  <dig> wild boars. evolutionary rates  were inferred form the filtered alignments of these  <dig> module genes . we found that 80% of these genes had ka/ks ratios <  <dig> , indicating a high level of purifying selection pressure in these genes , and approximately 7% of the genes had ka/ks ratios > <dig>  . five genes under strong positive selection were identified in the prenatal common modules , while only one of the genes under positive selection in the lt-blue module was identified in the  <dig> prenatal breed-specific modules . in the postnatal modules, five genes from six breed-specific modules were found to be under strong positive selection, while no positively selected genes were found in the postnatal common modules. these genes could be involved in the regulation the basic cell biological processes, such as cell migration , transport , proteolysis , and rna process  . in particular, cmya <dig> and fhod <dig> have been reported to regulate the muscle cell phenotype and meat quality  <cit> . these results suggested that the genes under positive selection may have played a role in the muscle phenotype divergence among pig breeds. however, among these positively selected genes, only fhod <dig> was a hub gene in the postnatal lt-orange and lde-purple modules . a high level of purifying selection pressure was identified in  <dig> other muscle related hub genes. therefore, although coding sequences changes under positive selection have a role in the evolution of gene function, their role in the muscle phenotype divergence among pig breeds seemed to be minor. the divergent of coexpression modules among breeds might regulate the muscle phenotype divergence during domestication.figure  <dig>

discussion
during the domestication of wild boar, dramatic phenotype changes were generated in domestic pigs under artificial selection with different breeding goals. for example, the lean  and obese  pig breeds have significant genetic differences in the processes associated with muscle growth rate and fatness  <cit> . the pig genome has been sequenced and resequenced, which has made it easier to investigate the regulatory mechanism that underlie the phenotype diversity in domestic pigs. using the genome resequence methods, rubin et al.  <cit>  identified a few genes related to pig domestication that were under positive selection; however, none of these genes were related to muscle phenotype. most previous studies have focused on changes in gene expression, while several studies have reported that connectivity was a more sensitive measure of evolutionary divergence compared with gene expression changes alone  <cit> . therefore, we used wgcna to reveal molecular and evolutionary mechanisms associated with the coordination of gene expression patterns in different pig breeds with distinct muscle phenotypes. in this study, we showed that the transcriptional diversity of different muscle phenotypes was regulated at the genome level by distinct gene coexpression networks.

comparison of the coexpression network modules between prenatal lt and lde animals, which were constructed using transcriptome data of five developmental stages, revealed that  <dig> genes in two modules were also conserved in the lt and lde pigs. we have highlighted seven hub genes  that were predicted to play key roles in muscle development. smn <dig> encodes a protein that is crucial in neuromuscular maturation  <cit> . gnb2l <dig>  <cit>  and sbds  <cit>  encode proteins that are involved in cell division and growth, which may contribute to the proliferation of muscle cells. hoxb <dig>  hey <dig> and pbx <dig> encode proteins that directly regulate muscle development  <cit> , and elof <dig> encodes a conserved transcription elongation factor, which might regulate the basic transcription process of muscle genes  <cit> . these results suggested that the conserved coexpression network modules contained genes that were associated with the regulation of basic muscle development; implying that the key processes that regulate muscle development are similar in the two breeds. nonetheless, six highly lean-specific modules and five highly obese-specific modules were identified in the prenatal lt and lde animals, indicating that prenatal myogenesis was significantly different in the two breeds. most of these breed-specific modules were involved in muscle development, neuron development, and cellular response. among the genes with known functions,  <dig> hub genes related to muscle development were found to play major roles in the six lean-specific modules. as an essential myogenesis regulator in many diverse species, mef2d directly regulates muscle genes at all developmental stages  <cit> . sirt <dig> has been found to increase the cell proliferation of myoblasts  <cit> . fermt <dig> regulates myogenic differentiation by the myogenic factor, myogenin, via canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . des  <cit> , mapk <dig>  <cit> , dlk <dig>  <cit>  and map <dig>  <cit>  were reported to play essential roles in myoblast fusion, myotube formation, and maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of muscle during myogenesis. osr <dig>  <cit>  and tcea <dig>  <cit>  encode proteins that regulate proliferation and development genes. ank <dig>  <cit>  and hsbp <dig>  <cit>  have been found to play critical roles in myogenesis. in the obese-specific modules, only seven key muscle related hub genes were found. among these genes, malat <dig> encodes a protein that was reported to regulate myoblast proliferation  <cit> , and eno <dig> and dag <dig>  <cit>  have both been shown to regulate myogenesis  <cit> . a greater number of hub genes related to myogenesis were detected in the lean-specific modules compared with in the obese-specific modules.

this might have resulted in the formation of more muscle fibers in lde pig during embryonic development, which may explain the main phenotype difference in prenatal muscle development between the lt and lde breeds  <cit> . in addition to the genes that were directly associated with myogenesis, numerous muscle fiber type related genes in the coexpression network modules were different between the lt and lde pigs. for example, the hub genes myl <dig>  <cit> , tnnt <dig>  <cit> , and myh <dig>  <cit>  in the lean-specific modules, encode proteins that are critical for fast fiber differentiation, and tpm <dig>  <cit>  and mylpf  <cit>  have been reported to be critically important for fast and slow skeletal muscle development. in the obese-specific modules, the hub gene myh <dig> encodes a protein that regulates slow skeletal muscle fiber  <cit> , while actn <dig>  <cit> , tnni <dig>  <cit> , and myoz <dig>  <cit>  have been found to be highly expressed in fast skeletal muscle fibers, and myoz <dig> is closely related to meat quality  <cit> . total fiber number and muscle fiber composition between fast and slow muscle fibers are associated with different muscle phenotypes  <cit> . all these modules contain genes that can regulate differences in development of muscle fiber number, size, and fiber composition between the two breeds. thus, these modules may be responsible for the different muscle features and meat quality in the lt and lde pigs  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that muscle phenotype is determined during embryonic development and that postnatal muscle growth is not critical  <cit> . however, in our by coexpression network module analysis, we found that differences in transcriptional profiling between lt and lde were more significant in postnatal animals than in prenatal animals. only two modules that contained  <dig> module genes  were conserved in both breeds, and none of the genes were related to muscle regulation. in contrast, our analysis of  <dig> lean-specific modules and  <dig> obese-specific modules containing  <dig> genes revealed a molecular regulation mechanism that was associated with the different muscle phenotype in the two breeds. although muscle phenotype was found to be determined during embryonic development, several hub genes related to muscle development were identified in these modules. in lean-specific modules, a hub gene in lde-salmon, stat5b, was reported to be critical for normal postnatal growth  <cit> . stat5b encodes a transcription factor that can regulate skeletal muscle growth and fiber composition. the absence of stat5b has been shown to increase the expression levels of several genes that regulate type i fibers, which resulted in muscle composed almost exclusively of type ii fibers  <cit> . thus, stat5b and mylpf  <cit> , a hub gene in the lde-light yellow module, might be critical for muscle growth and fiber composition in postnatal development. other hub genes, vcam <dig>  <cit>  and cxcl <dig>  <cit> , in the lde-light yellow module have been reported to play roles in the control of secondary muscle growth. thus, although muscle phenotype is determined mainly during embryonic development, we found that secondary muscle growth during postnatal development was also critical for the muscle phenotype difference between lt and lde. the hub genes setd <dig>  <cit> , dzip <dig>  <cit> , lmna  <cit> , prmt <dig>  <cit> , jun  <cit> , tead <dig>  <cit> , ell <dig>  <cit>  and sparc  <cit>  have been shown to control muscle cell proliferation and differentiation and regulate muscle development. some of the hub genes that we identified have been reported to be involved in proliferation and differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes; for example, cbx <dig>  <cit> , prrx <dig>  <cit> , pdlim <dig>  <cit> , fabp <dig>  <cit> , and ubr <dig>  <cit> . the coexpression network modules that contain these genes may regulate the development of the vascular and circulatory system. in addition, the hub genes, mybpc <dig>  <cit> , unc45b  <cit>  and myoz <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to be are required for skeletal muscle function, such as muscle contraction. these results suggest that the lean-specific modules cover all the main processes of postnatal muscle development, including muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, secondary muscle growth, postnatal muscle growth for fiber composition, development of the vascular and circulatory system, and muscle function regulation. all these coexpression network modules seem to be associated with the mechanisms that regulate the high lean meat percentage muscle phenotype in lde.

in addition to the numerous genes that were found to positively regulate muscle development in the coexpression network modules of lde, we identified hub genes that negatively regulate muscle development in the postnatal lt modules. rheb was found to negatively regulate skeletal myogenesis by repression of insulin receptor substrate  <dig>   <cit> , and klf <dig> was reported to inhibit myoblast proliferation by suppression of the promoter activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  <cit> . although jak <dig> was found to be critical in promoting proliferation, it was also found to prevent the premature differentiation of myoblasts  <cit> . in contrast, mustn <dig> was shown to have no effect on myoblast proliferation, but was found to significantly impairs myoblast differentiation and prevent myofusion  <cit> . these negative coexpression network modules associated with muscle development might control the muscle phenotype in lt, which features low lean meat percentage, slow-growing muscle and low body weight. these characteristics facilitate the deposition of high levels of intramuscular fat. besides these negative regulation modules, several positive coexpression network modules were also identified in lt. tead <dig> was shown to regulate the fast-to-slow fiber-type transition and overexpression of tead <dig> was found to produce a slower skeletal muscle contractile phenotype  <cit> . the hub genes six <dig>  <cit> , myf <dig>  <cit> , cdk <dig>  <cit> , tead <dig>  <cit> , and prmt <dig>  <cit>  in lt are myogenesis genes that regulate myogenic differentiation and muscle development. fhod <dig>  <cit>  and s100a <dig>  <cit>  regulate smooth muscle cell migration, vesicular exocytosis, and smooth muscle cell phenotype, processes that are related to vascular and circulatory system development. smpx  <cit>  and gadd45a  <cit>  are lt-specific muscle function genes. in particular, we have identified coexpression network modules related to intramuscular fat deposition and meat quality. for example, the hub genes hdlbp  <cit> , sfrs <dig> and sfrs <dig>  <cit>  can regulate the deposition of intramuscular fat, while acot <dig> and acot <dig>  <cit>  can regulate lipid and amino acid metabolism. it has been suggested that fat deposition and fatty acid composition are the determining factors for meat quality  <cit> . atp5b  <cit>  and csrp <dig>  <cit>  were shown to play key roles in muscle fiber development and may be responsible for breed-specific differences in meat quality.

it has been suggested that muscle fiber composition, size, and total fiber number are critical for meat quality, and that slow fibers contribute to both juiciness and tenderness  <cit> . these muscle fiber features also define muscle phenotypes. in our comparative transcriptome analysis, we detected a greater number of coexpression network modules related to myogenesis and muscle growth, secondary postnatal muscle growth, fast fiber differentiation, and fiber composition in the lde transcriptome compared with in the lt transcriptome. although fewer coexpression network modules related to myogenesis and muscle growth were identified in lt, more modules related to negative regulation of postnatal muscle and slow skeletal muscle fiber development were identified compared with lde. in particular, coexpression network modules related to negative regulation of intramuscular fat deposition and meat quality were identified in lt. thus, the differences in coexpression network modules between lde and lt described above are likely to have resulted in the high lean meat percentage, fast-growing muscle, and high body weight characteristics in lde, and the high intramuscular fat content, slow-growing muscle, and low body weight characteristics in lt. however, our results showed that the muscle phenotype differences between the two breeds were not only regulated by muscle genes but were coordinated by muscle, nerve, and immunity related genes. the complex coexpression networks responsible for the different muscle phenotypes are likely to have been generated by artificial selection during the domestication process. the evolutionary analysis showed that the coding sequences of most of the module genes in the coexpression network modules were conserved among pig breeds under artificial selection. therefore, the role of changes in coding sequence under positive selection in the divergence of muscle phenotype among pig breeds was found to be minor. we propose that the divergence of coexpression modules among breeds under positive selection eventually regulated the muscle phenotype divergence during domestication. previous studies have usually focused on the effect of selection pressure on gene function. in this study, we have shifted the emphasis to the role of selection in the divergence of coexpression networks between breeds during the domestication process.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we have carried out the first comprehensive analysis of gene coexpression relationships in muscle development in two pig breeds from embryo to adult. we identified significant differences in coexpression networks modules between the lde and lt breeds, which may be responsible for divergence of the muscle phenotypes. a greater number of coexpression network modules related to myogenesis, postnatal muscle growth, and fast fiber differentiation were found in lde compared with in lt. however, although fewer modules of myogenesis and muscle growth were identified in lt, more modules related to slow muscle fiber and negative regulation of muscle development were found. in particular, we identified five modules related to intramuscular fat deposition and meat quality in lt. we showed that positive selection played a key role in the divergence of the breed-specific modules, while changes in the gene coding sequence among breeds played only a minor role. our results demonstrate that the molecular mechanism underlying phenotype divergence between breeds cannot be robustly explained by differential gene expression alone, but can be explained by coexpression network modules. the elucidation of gene coexpression network divergence in the developmental processes of different breeds provides a new foundation for understanding the functional organization of transcriptomes in phenotype variation.
