BACKGROUND
globally, primary producers fix ~ <dig> gigatons of carbon each year  <cit> . this production is equally distributed between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems  <cit> . haptophytes are globally abundant and important photosynthetic microalgae found in both marine and freshwater environments. recent estimates indicate that haptophytes alone may represent “…30-50% of total photosynthetic standing stock in the world’s oceans”  <cit> , where they play a key role in carbon fixation. some haptophyte species are photosynthetic as well as mixotrophic, thus can live in dysphotic zones where light levels are too low to support photosynthesis  <cit> . this metabolic versatility may contribute to fitness, and help explain haptophyte prevalence within global algal populations.

haptophyte evolutionary history remains enigmatic. based on fossil records and 18s rdna phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , it is estimated that these algae are an ancient lineage, arising over  <dig>  billion years ago. phylogenomic analyses of the plastids of haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates  and cryptophytes show that the plastids of these four groups, collectively termed “cash”  <cit> , form a monophyletic grouping descendent from red algal plastids. however, the relationships among cash plastids remains controversial, as differing topologies are recovered in phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast genes using various methods and loci  . aside from the plastid lineage controversy, the haptophyte host lineage may be affiliated with the stramenopile-alveolate-rhizaria  group  <cit> .

despite their important ecological roles and interesting evolutionary history, there has been little genomic characterization of diverse haptophyte species. two classes define haptophytes. the monophyletic pavlovophyceae display minimal diversity, being described by  <dig> orders. in contrast, the polyphyletic and globally abundant prymnesiophyceae encompass  <dig> orders, of which the b <dig> clade seems most dominant in marine and fresh water ecosystems  <cit> . of this vast assemblage of haptophytes, the organellar genomes of only one representative of the pavlovophyceae, , and three of the prymnesiophyceae  have been sequenced. the large and complex prymnesiales that encompass the b <dig> to b <dig> clades  <cit> , lack a sequenced representative. this omission is surprising given reports demonstrating that >55% of all haptophyte sequences in a mediterranean location belong to this taxonomic assemblage  <cit> , and that members of this clade can dominate fresh water ecosystems  <cit> . we reasoned that determining the genomic sequence of a b <dig> representative in the prymnesiales would provide new information on haptophyte evolutionary origins and ecosystem roles.

the b <dig> clade prymnesiophyte chosen for sequencing, chrysochromulina tobin, is a newly defined algal species . this small  unicellular alga is naturally wall-less, being delineated solely by a plasma membrane. it lacks scales or additional extracellular structures. chrysochromulina tobin lives in fresh to brackish water and is mixotrophic  <cit> , using a long haptonema to hunt bacterial prey. bacteria-containing cultures exhibit improved growth and produce more fatty acid than those maintained axenically . nevertheless, c. tobin can be grown on completely defined artificial medium, and cell division is synchronized by light/dark photoperiods.

here we report the sequencing and annotation of the complete chrysochromulina tobin mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes. these genomes were analyzed using available data from rhodophytes , chlorophytes  as well as haptophytes and other members of the cash complex. data reported here show the mitochondrial genome to contain a large and complex repeat comprising 28% of the mitochondrial sequence, and to have lost several nad genes . the c. tobin chloroplast genome contains a novel intergenic ribosomal spacer region, and multiple snps between rdna copies within the inverted ribosomal repeat regions. analyses of chloroplast tandem and inverted repeats demonstrate gene-specific associations, regardless of algal species. features of several genes provide new insight into aspects of chloroplast genome evolution including lateral gene transfer, gene retention, novel functional rolls and putative regulatory structures localized within intergenic regions.

RESULTS
mitochondrial and chloroplast genome sequencing
purified total genomic dna was used to prepare libraries for both the  <dig> pyrosequencing and illumina platforms. a total of  <dig>  million reads and  <dig> million reads were generated on the  <dig> and illumina platforms respectively, and then assembled using newbler  <cit>  and velvet  <cit>  . the resulting draft assembly included  <dig>  contigs with an average length of ~ <dig> kb. a single contig of  <dig>  bp represented 74% of the mitochondrial genome, but no other assembled contigs contained remaining known mitochondrial sequence, likely due to the presence of a large repeat structure. this repeat structure required pcr amplification and sequencing to resolve the final circular draft. the chloroplast genome was contained in two assembled contigs that totaled  <dig>  bp in length. due to the ribosomal inverted repeat, pcr followed by sanger sequencing of the amplified products was used to join the two sequences and form a complete, circular mapping chloroplast assembly.

mitochondrial gene content
the chrysochromulina tobin mitochondrial genome  is  <dig>  bp in size, has a gc content of  <dig> %. the genome encodes  <dig> genes, including  <dig> trnas,  <dig> protein coding genes and a split ribosomal operon comprising the 16s and 23s rrna genes . the mitochondrial  <dig> protein coding gene complement includes a single novel open reading frame  that encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein that lacks strong homology to any other protein within the ncbi database. as in other sequenced haptophytes, ncbi translation table  <dig>  <cit>  was used, where uga codes tryptophan rather than a termination codon. comparison of the genomic content among all published haptophyte genomes  indicate that  <dig> energy and metabolism genes are conserved in all examined taxa. all haptophyte genomes also contain an identical complement of five ribosomal proteins  except for p. antarctica and p. globosa which are missing the rps <dig> or the rps <dig> and rps <dig> genes respectively . most notably, nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> are consistently missing from all haptophyte and rhodophyte mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date. interestingly, these three genes are present in all cryptophyte and stramenopile mitochondrial genomes.figure  <dig>

with respect to mitochondrial gene synteny among haptophyte taxa, many structural rearrangements have occurred. the results of mauve  <cit>  gene cluster analysis showed very poor gene cluster conservation . the extensive nature of shuffled gene order is further evidenced by the fact that the ribosomal operon is split in all haptophyte genomes  except e. huxleyi.

mitochondrial repeats
the chrysochromulina tobin mitochondrial genome contains a large repeat region measuring  <dig>  kb in length . this region features three large tandem repeats, each ~ <dig>  kb in length that are flanked by two regions consisting of additional small tandem repeats. these small tandem repeat regions are composed of three subunits, arbitrarily classified a, b and c, based on sequence homology . repeat unit a is comprised of  <dig> bp. unit b consists of  <dig> bp, of which ~ <dig> bp exhibit significant sequence identity to unit a. unit c is  <dig> bp in length. although the flanking repeat regions are not identical in size , a consistent pattern of b-a-a-a-b is found within these two flanking domains. the three large tandem repeats are separated from each other within the repeat region by spacers . interestingly, this direct repeat arrangement is strikingly similar to the larger  repeat structure found in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> . the cryptophytes, hemiselmis andersenii and rhodomonas salina, and the chlorophytes pedinomonas minor and acutodesmus obliquus also contain large tandem repeat regions  that differ from the minimal repeat embellishment seen in most mitochondrial genomes of other algae.

not surprisingly, the complexity of this repeat structure caused assembly challenges. the fact that p. antarctica, p. globosa, and p. lutheri mitochondrial genomes remain incomplete is likely due to the presence of one or more large repeat structures. for example, smith et. al.  <cit>  reported unresolved repeats within two repeat regions in p. antarctica and p. globosa. unfortunately, the use of short read, high throughput sequencing techniques do not easily facilitate solving these complex repeat structures. the first e. huxleyi mitochondrial genome published in  <dig>  <cit> , the stramenopile, heterosigma akashiwo <cit> , as well as the diatoms phaeodactylum tricornutum and thalassiosira pseudonana <cit>  utilized fosmid sequencing, that supported assembly and primer walking for the resolution of longer repeats.

chloroplast gene content
the chrysochromulina tobin chloroplast genome  is  <dig>  bp in size and has a gc content of  <dig> %. the genome encodes  <dig> genes  including  <dig> trna coding genes,  <dig> protein coding genes and an inverted repeat, with each repeat copy containing the 23s, 16s and 5s rrna genes. the trnas present in this genome represent all potential amino acid anticodons, including a start methionine. within the chloroplast genome, codon usage is standard for plastid genomes, and protein alignments suggest that codon gtg  may serve as the translation initiation codon for ycf <dig>  rps <dig>  psbe, ycf <dig> and psbc. such alternative translational start codons have been reported to occur in algal chloroplast genomes of wide taxonomic divergence   although not for the same genes established in c. tobin.figure  <dig>

the c. tobin chloroplast gene complement is similar to other sequenced haptophyte chloroplast genomes: . additionally, an “uncultured prymnesiophyte c19847”  was included in this analysis. all haptophyte genomes are relatively small in size when compared to other microalgal species . gene content comparison shows e. huxleyi  contains dfr  that is absent in c. tobin. unlike c. tobin, p. antarctica and p. globosa chloroplast genomes  are missing orf <dig> , ycf <dig> , thig, and this . a conserved coding region , found uniquely in c. tobin  and e. huxleyi , is located adjacent to psbv in both genomes. the amino acid identity of these two hypothetical genes is low, suggesting remnants of functional proteins. the chloroplast genome of the phylogenetically distant haptophyte, p. lutheri, is missing  <dig> genes, and contains an additional  <dig> genes that are not found in available haptophyte chloroplast genomes . while gene content is similar among all of the haptophytes analyzed, the freshwater c. tobin actually has the highest sequence identity to the marine uncultured prymnesiophyte c <dig>  this result is not too surprising given recent studies that document the occurrence of multiple, independent freshwater colonizations by haptophytes  <cit> . our  <dig> s rdna based phylogenetic analyses  show c. tobin to cluster with species isolated from fresh water lakes in france  <cit> .table  <dig>

co-linearity in gene placement among haptophyte chloroplast genomes was assessed . unlike in diatoms  <cit> , gene clusters have been exchanged between the large and small single copy regions within these haptophyte chloroplast genomes. when comparing e. huxleyi to c. tobin, and e. huxleyi to p. antarctica,  <dig> and  <dig> gene clusters were conserved, respectively. a highly conserved region of  <dig>  bp encompassing ccs <dig> through atpa  was identified. this region contains a single inversion in the c. tobin rps <dig> and rps <dig> coding region, and is more highly conserved between e. huxleyi and p. antarctica – expanding to a ~ <dig>  bp region that initiates with petl  and ends with psbe . another large gene cluster conserved in all three species consists of ~ <dig>  bp that contains the commonly preserved  <dig> ribosomal protein gene operon and the dnak heat shock protein. grimm  <cit>  analysis was used to quantify the degree of gene rearrangement among the three completed haptophyte chloroplast genomes above. the most parsimonious result found  <dig> genome rearrangements occurring between e. huxleyi and p. antarctica,  <dig> rearrangements between p. antarctica and c. tobin, and  <dig> rearrangements between e. huxleyi and c. tobin. the scrambled placement of genes among these haptophytes yields no clear insight into relatedness.figure  <dig>

chloroplast repeats
large inverted repeat
the chrysochromulina tobin ribosomal repeat region is structurally unique when compared to those found in both land plants and all algal chloroplasts sequenced to date. eighty two percent  of all chloroplast genomes  examined at the genus level contain a large inverted repeat. the conventional structure of this conserved operon includes the 16s ribosomal gene, an intergenic spacer region  that encodes the trna-isoleucine , and the trna-alanine . the isr is followed by the 23s ribosomal subunit gene and the 5s ribosomal gene . in land plants and chlorophytic algae, and less often in rhodophytes and cash members  <cit> , the repeat region expands to include additional genes that flank the ribosomal gene operon, making the inverted repeat in chlorophytes larger on average . the ribosomal inverted repeat structures in c. tobin have non-identical trna coding sequences within each ribosomal intergenic spacer region . this domain normally contains two identical trna coding regions in each inverted repeat. however, c. tobin has only trna alanine in inverted repeat a, and trna isoleucine in inverted repeat b . this pattern is also likely present in the uncultured prymnesiophyte c <dig>  only a single operon was assembled for this organism, but that operon solely contained trna-ile within the isr. interestingly, the c <dig> ribosomal operon that is adjacent to the petb gene contains a trna-ile, while the ribosomal operon adjacent to petb in c. tobin contains trna-ala. intramolecular recombination within chloroplast genomes having an inverted repeat is well documented for several algae as well as in land plants . this process generates genomic isomers that differ solely in the orientation of their single copy domains. surprisingly, using long pcr to bridge both c. tobin repeat regions, no evidence of such flip-flop recombination was found.figure  <dig>

†large repeats containing the ribosomal operon in chloroplast genomes were queried for size and sequence homology between the 16s and 23s ribosomal subunits. the three organisms cyanidioschyzon merolae , bryopsis hypnoides  and monomorphina aenigmatica  were omitted from the small repeat statistical analyses because of the presence of a greatly expanded tandem repeat structure or large  repeat structures, which causes an over representation the repeat structure due to the counting nature of the analyses presented.

*cattolico ra, jacobs m, rocap g. unpublished genomic data.

non-canonical ribosomal operon structure is rarely found . within haptophytes, e. huxleyi has a canonical ribosomal operon structure, but p. antarctica and p. globosa do not. in both p. antarctica and p. globosa, one copy of the ribosomal operon contains both trnas in the intergenic spacer region , while the second copy lacks both trnas in the intergenic spacer domain . as also seen in figure  <dig>  copies of the ribosomal gene sequences encoded within the c. tobin repeat, contain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 16s  and 23s  ribosomal genes. notably, every cryptophyte and rhodophyte chloroplast genome examined that encodes a repeat structure also shows the presence of snps between replicated ribosomal genes . in contrast, only one alga in the chlorophyte lineage, ostreococcus tauri, contains a snp. additionally, no land plant species queried show snps in either 16s or 23s genes. though speculative, the presence of alternative operon structure for the ribosomal genes, combined with the elevated appearance of snps suggest that the well-recognized “copy correction” mechanism  <cit>  may be more effective in some “green” algal lineages , than in the “red” lineage of autotrophs . the route to repeat loss within an algal chloroplast genome may be augmented by the accumulation of snps and disintegration of operon integrity.

small repeat function in chloroplast genomes
chloroplast genomes are consistently embellished with small repeats that are either tandem or inverted in orientation. chrysochromulina tobin is no exception having  <dig> inverted repeats with an average length of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  bp in stem length with loop domains averaging  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  bp in size. a single tandem repeat comprised of a duplicated  <dig> bp sequence also occurs. similar to observations made for other chloroplast genomes  and bacterial genomes , most c. tobin chloroplast repeats occur within the intergenic space, at the termini of genes located on opposite coding strands .

the conservation of repeats within the chloroplast genomes of all algal taxa suggests a functional constraint for these structures. insight into the contribution of repeats to chloroplast metabolic processes was accomplished by elegant studies with chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exploited the early ability to transform this organism. though these studies were predominantly focused on inverted repeats and confined to a limited gene set , observations reveal a multifunctional role for repeat structures  <cit> . data show that the presence of a repeat at the terminus of a gene is necessary for proper mrna processing by exo- and endonucleases  <cit> , maintaining rna stability  <cit>  and supporting protein translation  <cit> .

given the established functional contribution of repeats, we asked whether specific genes or conserved chloroplast gene clusters  <cit>  were targeted for repeat association. significant gene-repeat association was observed. for example, an inverted repeat is found at the terminus  of the ribosomal protein operon that encompasses  <dig> genes; inverted repeats are often present after the rubisco operon , as well as following the photosystem ii gene pair . each of these targeted genes has no spatial relationship to one another with respect to in-chromosome placement; no concurrence exists among these genes in repeat type  and no similarity in sequence identity is seen in the repeat structures that are associated with the targeted gene. despite these facts, selected gene-repeat associations  are conserved in chloroplast genomes as taxonomically disparate as c. tobin and e. huxleyi , ectocarpus siliculosus , cyanidium caldarium  and rhodomonas salina  - a list that is by no means exhaustive. single genes that are not associated with operons can also be targeted for repeat tagging. a good example is clpc that encodes an atpase-dependent protease. this gene is found in different locations with many dissimilar up and downstream gene neighbors among cash taxa. clpc is tagged with a repeat in all haptophytes except p. lutheri. a repeat is also found next to clpc in  <dig> of  <dig>  cash plastid genomes analyzed to date. as shown in figure  <dig>  even within haptophytes, the repeat is conserved only in gene association. neither the size, sequence, nor stem loop structure formed by these repeats is conserved.figure  <dig>

given that repeats appear to have a functional significance, it was also of interest to determine whether a pattern in repeat acquisition exists among evolutionary diverse algae. repeat properties were queried across three groups of algae: rhodophytes , the ‘green’ algal lineage  and the cash grouping of algal species . data clearly show that the number of repeats found in a chloroplast genome varies when different algal groups are compared. rhodophytes appear to have few repeats , and the cash taxa have a moderate number . in contrast, the green plastid lineage has on average  <dig> repeats per genome, though representatives have as many as  <dig>  to  <dig>  . repeat type is also group dependent. cash algae have a greater number of inverted repeats in their chloroplast genomes, whereas the green lineages have significantly more tandem repeats . attempts to assess whether differences in chloroplast size and intergenic distance influenced the number and size of repeat structures show both parameters to be positively correlated with an increase in repeat number for green and cash plastid lineages . however, there appears to be a limit on repeat size in the cash plastid lineage, for even as genomes become larger and/or intergenic distances increase , repeat size does not exceed ~ <dig> bp. this result significantly contrasts with that seen in the green lineage. a strong correlation exists between increased repeat size, and either an increased genome size or an increased intergenic distance . the fact that repeat embellishment occurs in every algal chloroplast genome analyzed to date, that repeats often are conserved near specific genes, and repeats contribute to chloroplast gene expression, suggest that future research analyzing chloroplast intergenic regions is warranted.figure  <dig>

chloroplast protein characterization
analysis of select genes can provide unique insight into chloroplast genome evolution and function. in this context, several genes within the chrysochromulina tobin chloroplast genome are described below.

ribosomal protein rpl36
it is now known that some ribosomal proteins are multifunctional. not only do these proteins serve as architectural components in the ribosome itself, but may also have additional extra-ribosomal functions that help maintain cellular homeostasis  <cit> . as shown in figure 7b, the ‘conventional’  rpl <dig> protein encoded by chlorophytes and rhodophytes has a highly conserved zinc finger motif of the cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-histidine  type . the haptophyte and cryptophyte rpl <dig>  proteins lack the conserved zinc finger domain. in both haptophytes and cryptophytes the first cysteine is replaced by a serine, and the terminal histidine of the zinc finger motif is replaced by a leucine. therefore it is very unlikely that the haptophyte/cryptophyte rpl <dig> c− retains zinc finger protein function.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic analysis of rpl <dig> proteins. bayesian majority rule consensus tree of  <dig> rpl <dig> proteins from haptophytes, cryptophytes, a haptophyte plastid-containing dinoflagellate, stramenopiles, rhodophytes, paulinella chromatophora, and select bacteria and cyanobacteria. taxa are colored according to the legend. bayesian posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood bootstrap support are shown at nodes. scale bar shows amino acid substitutions per site . logo plot consensus sequences for the c− and c+ rpl <dig> protein . the zinc finger residues are completely conserved in the c+ genotype, while  <dig> residues are absent from the c− clade.



although the zinc finger function was not recognized, earlier studies used the unique rpl <dig> c− sequence observed in haptophyte and cryptophyte chloroplast genomes to argue for a sister relationship between the plastids of these taxa  <cit> . sanchez-puerta and delwiche attempted to reconcile the presence of an rpl <dig> c− gene  in the cryptophyte and haptophyte plastids with the presence of the ancestral rpl <dig> c+ gene in stramenopiles by positing that, for a time, two chloroplast genomes co-existed in the haptophytes and cryptophytes, some genomes containing the rpl <dig> c+ gene and others with the c− gene  <cit> . one or the other genome was then fixed in particular lineages. this hypothesis predicts the discovery of an rpl <dig> c+ gene in the chloroplast genomes of some haptophytes or cryptophytes. to better test this hypothesis, we infer a new rpl <dig> phylogeny including five additional haptophyte genera ,  <dig> additional stramenopiles, four additional rhodophytes, as well as a representative of the recently recognized algal lineage paulinella.

mining ncbi as well as our publically available chloroplast genome database  <cit> , a total of  <dig> non-redundant rpl <dig> amino acid sequences were recovered for phylogenetic analysis . in figure  <dig>  this large dataset is condensed and re-inferred to include sequences from a limited number of bacterial and cyanobacterial representatives; rhodophytic as well as cash plastids. we confirm the rpl <dig> c− identity of all haptophyte and cryptophyte algae to the exclusion of all other eukaryotic algal taxa sampled, including stramenopiles and rhodophytes  <cit> , thus sanchez-puerta and delwiche’s hypothesis was not confirmed. furthermore, even though our rpl <dig> phylogeny increases bacterial sampling beyond that used for prior analyses, results do not support a planctomycete-origin of the laterally transferred rpl <dig> as previously suggested  <cit> . no bacterial clade is strongly supported as the donor of the c− gene . determination of the donor lineage is made difficult by the short length of the rpl <dig> protein  and the ancient nature of the lateral gene transfer event.

the duality in chloroplast encoded rpl <dig> genes poses questions concerning the contribution of each alternative protein type to the maintenance of cellular stasis in different algal lineages. the functional contribution is most likely multifaceted. certainly, the rpl <dig> protein, whether of the c+ or c− type, contributes to ribosomal structure  <cit> . however, bacteria that contain both paralogs of the rpl <dig> protein differentially express rpl <dig> c− and rpl <dig> c+ when subject to zinc stress  <cit> . the rpl <dig> c− gene is up-regulated under limiting conditions. since the zinc finger domain of rpl <dig> not only binds zinc, but also bind other cationic species  <cit> , one might speculate that in algal cells an increased covalent ion binding potential might provide a competitive advantage when living in ecosystems where particular cofactors are in short supply. the fact that haptophyte/cryptophyte rpl <dig> c− proteins have an extended  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid c terminus that is enriched with positively charged as well as hydrophobic moieties supports the possibility that this small molecule also has a regulatory function, similar to that established for other ribosomal zinc finger proteins .

two component signal transduction systems
two-component regulatory systems are key mechanisms through which many organisms  control responses to fluctuating environmental conditions  <cit> . numerous two component regulatory systems exist. in its simplest form, when cued by an external stimulus, a phosphoryl group from a conserved histidine residue within a sensor kinase protein is transferred to an aspartic acid in the receiver domain of a response regulator protein. phosphorylation of the response regulator protein activates an effector domain  to propagate the intended regulatory effect.

the chrysochromulina tobin chloroplast genome encodes two response regulator proteins but is devoid of sensor kinase genes. the first response regulator protein, orf <dig>  encodes a protein similar to the trg <dig> response regulator described for the stramenopile heterosigma akashiwo <cit>  and is also found in other cash species, rhodophytes, and cyanobacteria. the second response regulator, ycf <dig>  is likely a member of a new subclass of response regulators evolved from the cyanobacterial type “chey-like” response regulator proteins. many of the cyanobacterial chey-like homologs are comprised of approximately  <dig> amino acids and contain two domains; the aforementioned receiver domain and a conserved domain of unknown function , hypothesized to be the effector. intriguingly, the chey-like homolog  found in c. tobin is comprised of only  <dig> amino acids. multi-sequence protein alignments of a variety of response regulators from cyanobacteria, algae, and arabidopsis revealed that the c-terminus of the c. tobin ycf <dig> is most similar to the cyanobacterial type chey-like proteins, as both contain the terminal duf <dig> domain. in contrast, the n-terminus of the c. tobin ycf <dig> is divergent from both cyanobacterial chey-like response regulators and the plant type response regulators , including loss of the canonical site of phosphorylation. nevertheless, sequences that resemble the c. tobin type of ycf <dig> are conserved in rhodophytes , other haptophytes , and some cyanobacteria  indicating that this protein still provides an important function. within this divergent subclass of ycf <dig> proteins an aspartic acid residue  just upstream of the canonical position is conserved, suggesting that this residue could replace the canonical site of phosphorylation by an as yet unknown sensor kinase.

structural analysis of ycf39
ycf <dig> is conserved in many cash and rhodophytic species. to gain insight into ycf <dig> identity and its potential functional role, a structural and comparative modeling approach was taken. the hhpred server  <cit>  was used to identify structures in the protein data bank   <cit>  that showed high sequence homology to ycf <dig>  the top  <dig> structures recovered  had e-values ranging from 9e− <dig> to  <dig> e− <dig>  amino acid sequence identity of ycf <dig> to these structural hits ranged between 15-18%. all structural hits show very similar fold identities, and fall under nmra-like or nad-binding domains by pfam classification  <cit> . eight out of ten structural homologs are known to bind nadp/nad . using the ten structures as templates for rosetta comparative modeling  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  trajectories were assessed and clustered based on backbone rmsd. the top scoring comparative model of ycf <dig>  is based on the structural template 2jl <dig> a triphenylmethane reductase . the 2jl <dig> and ycf <dig> sequence alignment is shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

to determine whether the proposed model of ycf <dig> could bind an nadp molecule, a large number of nadp conformers  were randomly docked into the largest pocket in the ycf <dig> 3d model. of the resulting random docked protein-ligand conformations obtained , the top binding energy conformation is presented in figure 8b. the model showed an equivalent positioning of nadp in the proposed pocket of the ycf <dig> 3d model as was observed in the template structure . in both cases, the nicotinamide group is buried in the protein, while the adenine group is near the surface. additionally, locating the nadp interacting amino acids on the template  and finding corresponding amino acids in ycf <dig> based on sequence alignment showed 38% sequence identity and another 24% similarity . these amino acids were in close proximity to the docked nadp in our ycf <dig> model .

taken together, the sequence similarity of the ycf <dig> protein product with nmra-like family proteins , the presence of a dockable site for nadp in the predicted structure of ycf <dig>  and striking similarity of the nadp interacting motif with a known nadp binder  suggests ycf <dig> should be identified as an nmra-like protein in c. tobin. a strong homology  of ycf <dig> to an nmra family protein identified in the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria nostoc azollae has also been found  <cit> . characterized nmra proteins function in the transcriptional regulation of genes important to nitrogen metabolite repression  <cit> , thus allowing a cell to access a preferred nitrogen source  <cit> . functional studies will be required to determine if the protein product of ycf <dig> serves this metabolic roll.

membrane transporter/translocator proteins
the majority of chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus. for this reason, translocators located in the chloroplast envelope are needed to facilitate import of the cytosolically produced proteins into the plastid. chloroplasts of primary endosymbiotic origin require protein transport across two membranes. this process is facilitated by two complexes, the toc and tic translocons, located in the outer and inner chloroplast envelopes respectively . in plastids of higher order endosymbiotic origin , protein transport is complicated by the presence of either three or four membranes surrounding the chloroplast  <cit> . nonetheless, tic and toc components have previously been found in algae containing more than two membranes  <cit> . here, we identify two potential tic subunit genes  encoded in the c. tobin chloroplast genome. tic <dig> is a small membrane protein that is anchored by three helices in the membrane and has protrusions into the stroma. a tic <dig> homolog is likely encoded by the ycf <dig> gene, a gene found exclusively in rhodophyte, haptophyte and stramenopile chloroplast genomes. tic <dig>  a second member of the inner membrane import complex, has poorly characterized function. we have identified ycf <dig> as a tic <dig> translocator protein homolog. ycf <dig> homologs are found exclusively in the chloroplast genomes of the haptophytes c. tobin, e. huxleyi, p. antarctica and the uncultured prymnesiophyte c <dig>  as well as rhodophytes. the continued sequestering of genes encoding these two translocator components of the innermost membrane of both primary and secondary plastids  suggests that evolutionary footprints of original transporter components still remain in select taxa.

blast homology searches for nuclear encoded translocator homologs gave mixed results when querying the draft nuclear genome of c. tobin . toc <dig> is the only nuclear encoded toc gene found in c. tobin. toc <dig>  toc <dig> and toc <dig> are absent or are diverged so identification was compromised.

nuclear genes with strong homology to tic <dig> and tic <dig> are found. this observation is consistent with data for the rhodophyte c. merolae <cit> . interestingly, tic <dig> is also found in c. tobin, but is absent in rhodophytic queries.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete sequence of chrysochromulina tobin mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, representative of the ecologically important haptophyte prymnesiales b <dig> clade, have been determined and annotated. within the mitochondrial genome, a large repeat structure consisting of ~ <dig> kb was found along with a novel  <dig> amino acid open reading frame of unknown function. the large inverted repeats in the chloroplast genome contain a combination of novel of intergenic spacer region structures and snp variants when rdna-containing domains are compared, indicating the possible loss of a copy correction mechanism. notably, no recombined structural isomers of the c. tobin chloroplast genome were found. small repeats within intergenic regions of the chloroplast genome have taxon-specific evolutionary features. the embellishment of specific genes by repeats argues for a functional role in metabolism for these structures. several genes found in c. tobin chloroplast that remain uncharacterized, yet conserved in other algal species were analyzed. they include: the ribosomal protein rpl36; a new two component signal transduction protein; the potential nmra-like nadp-binding nitrogen regulator, and two chloroplast protein import genes.
