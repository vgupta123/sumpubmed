BACKGROUND
tilapia is the common name for a group of 40- <dig> nominal species of cichlid fishes  native to africa and the middle east. tilapias have been an important aquaculture species for thousands of years. sometimes called the 'aquatic chicken', tilapia are sturdy and adaptable fish, and are now cultured in more than  <dig> countries in asia and the americas  <cit> . tilapias are a cornerstone of future aquaculture production, and genetic improvement of this species is needed to increase growth rate and improve disease resistance. cichlid fishes are also important models for research on vertebrate physiology, behavior, and evolutionary biology. because of their close evolutionary relationship, genetic resources developed for tilapia are also useful for studying the extraordinary radiation of haplochromine cichlids in the lakes of east africa  <cit> .

genetic resources for tilapia are relatively well developed, and include a microsatellite-based genetic map  <cit>  and a physical map based on bac fingerprints  <cit> . in contrast, est resources for these species are limited. modest est projects have been published for some haplochromine cichlids  <cit> . although several labs have constructed cdna libraries for tilapia, and a few thousand ests have been characterized  <cit> , until now large-scale sequencing of ests has not been pursued in tilapia.

the applications of a high-quality est resource are manifold. many researchers are interested in constructing microarrays to study changes in gene expression during development  <cit>  and in response to environmental stressors including handling  <cit> , temperature  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , disease  <cit>  and environmental contaminants  <cit> . ests will provide an important resource for annotating the forthcoming tilapia genome sequence. a major effort is needed to enlarge the database of cichlid ests to facilitate analysis of gene expression and contribute to genome annotation. here we describe the sequencing of almost  <dig>  ests from highly normalized libraries constructed from  <dig> tissues of the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus.

RESULTS
cdna libraries and est sequences
we constructed a total of two non-normalized and  <dig> normalized libraries from  <dig> tissues or developmental time points . three normalized libraries captured gene expression during early development . normalized libraries were also constructed for brain, heart, kidney, liver, olfactory epithelium, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen and stomach. normalized libraries were constructed separately for adult ovary and testis, along with a normalized mixed library of differentiating ovary and testis from  <dig> -  <dig> days post-fertilization. for gill and retina, paired libraries  were compared.

the normalization procedure was highly effective. figure  <dig> presents southern blots for non-normalized and normalized retinal libraries probed for rhodopsin. each panel contains approximately  <dig>  clones. the non-normalized panel shows approximately  <dig> clones positive for rhodopsin. the normalized panel shows only about  <dig> positive clones. for this gene then, the number of duplicate clones has been reduced approximately 40-fold.

we sequenced approximately  <dig> clones from each library to check the size and quality of the inserts. we then submitted approximately  <dig>  clones from each library for high-throughput sequencing. after analysis of these sequences, we selected some libraries for additional sequencing. we obtained at least partial sequence data from  <dig>  clones. the number of sequences obtained from each library is shown in table  <dig>  the sequences were then passed through the est2uni analysis pipeline  <cit> . this pipeline includes a preprocessing step that includes vector trimming and masking of repetitive and low complexity sequences. the total number of reads passing the trimming step was  <dig>  .

clustering of tilapia ests
we performed separate cap <dig> assemblies to assess the rate of sequence discovery for each library . after sequencing  <dig>  clones from each library, the rate of discovery ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads/discovery . this quantification allowed us to select the least redundant libraries for further sequencing.

* includes forward and reverse reads for some clones

as expected, the number of reads required to discover a new sequence increased over time. figure  <dig> plots the discovery statistic for the brain <dig> and retina <dig> libraries at different levels of sequence coverage. both libraries showed a gradual increase in the number of reads required to discover a new sequence.

final assembly
after sequencing of all the libraries was complete, we analyzed all of the sequences together to produce a single assembly consisting of  <dig>  unigenes averaging  <dig>  bp in length, for a total assembled length of  <dig> , <dig> bp. the distribution of contig lengths is shown in figure  <dig> 

the average number of ests per unique sequence  was  <dig> . the average number of ests per contig was  <dig> , and the maximum number of ests in a contig was  <dig>  the nine contigs with more than  <dig> sequences each were mostly genes that we expect to be highly expressed, including hemoglobin, rhodopsin, parvalbumin, mhc class i, and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunits  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two of these exceptionally large contigs appeared to be artifacts representing assembly of repetitive sequences.

sequence similarity and functional annotation
 <dig>   of the unassembled ests and  <dig>   of the assembled unigenes found a significant  blast match in the uniprot database. we calculated the fraction of ests and unigenes that were complete on the 5' and 3' ends by scoring the number of sequences that matched to within  <dig> amino acids of the 5' and 3' ends of each uniprot entry . this proportion varied with the length of the uniprot entry . sixty-five percent of the ests matching uniprots <250aa were complete on the 5' end. for uniprots between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids this fraction dropped to 36%. similarly, 68% of the unigenes matching uniprots <250aa were complete on the 5' end, and the fraction dropped to 36% for uniprots between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. overall  <dig> % of the ests and  <dig> % of the unigenes were complete on both the 5' and 3' ends.  <dig>   of the unigenes were mapped to candidate gene ontology  terms. following the application of the annotation rules,  <dig>   of the unigenes were annotated with go terms. the proportion of unigenes annotated with go terms can be seen for each of the three go functional categories  in additional file 1: figure s <dig>   <dig>   of the unigenes had a single-directional best hit to the kegg pathway database.

microsatellites and snps
we identified  <dig>  microsatellites in the assembled sequences. these include  <dig> dinucleotide,  <dig> trinucleotide and  <dig> tetranucleotide repeat loci. the most abundant repeats were ac dinucleotides  followed by aat trinucleotides . most of the microsatellites identified were in the 3'utr  or the 5'utr . only 24% were found within the open reading frame.

the est2uni pipeline identified  <dig>  candidate snps in the assembled contigs. for  <dig>  of these candidate snps each of the alternative bases was represented at least twice. of these,  <dig>  represented transition substitutions and  <dig>  represented transversions.

discussion
effectiveness of normalization
normalization of copy number during library construction produces a more even distribution of clone frequencies, increasing the rate of gene discovery  <cit> . when very large numbers of ests are needed, serial-subtractive hybridization is an effective, but technically demanding, method for removing duplicate clones  <cit> . an alternative is cherry-picking of unique clones identified by filter hybridization  <cit> .

we normalized the cdna population before cloning using a duplex-specific nuclease from the kamchatka crab  <cit> . this enzyme can be used to degrade rapidly hybridizing components of a cdna mixture, reducing the representation of highly expressed genes. this method proved highly effective, reducing the representation of the more abundant transcripts by 40-fold. we further increased our chances of detecting rare transcripts by constructing libraries from a large number of different tissues and developmental stages. the overall rate of gene discovery for this project compares favorably with projects of similar scope.

to further study the effectiveness of normalization, we used blast to screen the normalized retinal library for genes expected from rod and cone phototransduction. we identified rhodopsin as well as  <dig> of the  <dig> cone opsins in these libraries . we further identified numerous genes from the rod phototransduction pathway, including all three subunits of the g protein , phosphodiesterase subunits , the sodium/calcium exchanger  and g protein kinase . for the cone pathway, we were able to find arrestin , but did not identify other phototransduction proteins. in most vertebrates, rod photoreceptors are more prevalent than cone photoreceptors. in fish the ratio or rods to cones is typically 50: <dig>  <cit> . the expression of the various phototransduction genes is less than opsin by factors of  <dig>  to  <dig>  or more  <cit> . our normalization scheme reduced the representation of the most highly expressed genes by a factor of  <dig>  if expression of genes in the cone pathway is 50× less frequent than that of the rod, and if the components of the rest of the phototransduction pathway are 10× less frequent, it is perhaps not surprising that we only observed cone opsins and cone arrestin from the cone pathway. while this confirms the effectiveness of our normalization methods, it suggests that additional genes would be discovered if we continued to sequence these highly normalized libraries.

anchors for comparative mapping
microsatellites associated with genes provide an efficient means to construct comparative maps among species  <cit> . in channel catfish, as many as 12% of ests contain microsatellite sequences  <cit> . using roughly the same search parameters, we found microsatellites in only  <dig> of  <dig>   of tilapia unigenes. nevertheless, these  <dig> microsatellites provide a useful starting point for comparative mapping  <cit> . the subset of high confidence snps is another starting point for constructing a comparative genetic map of tilapia with other fish species.

CONCLUSIONS
our project has significantly enhanced the est resources available for cichlid fishes. while the total number of ests for tilapia still lags behind that for other fish species, our use of multiple highly normalized libraries has contributed to a high level of gene discovery. the number of uniprot hits for our est collection rivals that for other model fish species  <cit> . the total length of the assembled transcriptome  is similar to the total length of the annotated regions of the tetraodon  and takifugu  genomes  <cit> . this annotated collection of clustered ests will be a key resource for annotation of cichlid genome sequences for studies of cichlid physiology, development and evolution.
