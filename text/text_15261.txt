BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis infection is the cause of bovine tuberculosis, an important health problem in cattle with zoonotic potential for transmission to humans. in cattle this infection can be slowly progressive, with limited outward signs of disease, making diagnosis and eradication of tuberculosis difficult. current diagnostic techniques often involve an in vivo single intradermal comparative tuberculin test , alone, or combined with an in vitro elisa based interferon-γ assay   <cit> . however, problems remain with the sensitivity of current diagnostics leading to a failure to detect all infected animals  <cit> .

following initial exposure to m. bovis, a specific t-cell immune response develops characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines including ifn-γ  <cit> . the loss of this early proinflammatory cytotoxic response is thought to be associated with an inability to control infection, resulting in progression to clinical disease  <cit> . the persistence of infection leading to chronic tuberculosis may be due to an ineffective immune response that involves suppression of specific immune mechanisms  <cit> .

the immune response to tuberculosis is a complex process and studies in the bovine model have primarily focused on the adaptive immune response. although the t-cell response is critical in controlling tuberculosis infection in cattle  <cit> , studies in mice and humans suggest a significant role for innate immune mechanisms in mounting early and effective immune responses to mycobacterial infection  <cit> . development of an effective adaptive immune response is dependent on innate immune activation. the innate immune response is regulated via receptors for antigen recognition known as pathogen recognition receptors  and antigen presentation molecules. prrs including the toll-like receptors  have been implicated in the immune response to m. bovis bcg  <cit> , specifically tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig>  <cit> . a diverse range of mechanisms used by mycobacteria to subvert the host immune response have also been described  <cit> . mycobacteria can inhibit host cell signalling via the tlrs and other mediators of the innate immune response  <cit> ; they may also interfere with maturation of the phagosome in infected macrophages, thereby reducing the ability of the host to successfully eliminate the pathogen  <cit> . failure or subversion of an appropriate innate immune response may therefore be critical to the establishment of infection and progression to disease  <cit> .

in recent years, high-throughput genomic analyses have facilitated identification of transcriptional regulatory networks involved in the orchestration of the immune response  <cit> . gene expression studies of host responses to infection can provide a powerful tool for understanding the interactions between pathogens and the host immune system and may be particularly powerful in identifying specific molecules or pathways that have been targeted by pathogens for immune evasion  <cit> . one desirable outcome of genomic analyses across large gene subsets is the identification of an infection expression signature that may be used to differentiate groups based on their infection status  <cit> . microarrays have recently been applied to the study of m. tuberculosis infection  <cit>  and unique host gene expression signatures have been attributed to specific strains of m. avium in human macrophages  <cit> . in cattle, microarray studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis -infected cattle have revealed map-associated gene profiles, which include cytokines and other putative biomarkers that are indicative of infection status  <cit> . these investigations also revealed that differential gene expression patterns were identifiable irrespective of whether pbmc were stimulated with antigen. differential gene expression patterns may therefore provide useful novel diagnostic and prognostic tools  <cit> .

we have previously used a bovine targeted immunospecific cdna microarray to study gene expression changes in pbmc from bovine tuberculosis- infected cattle cultured in vitro in the presence of bovine and avian tuberculins  <cit> . stimulation with tuberculin antigens induced significant expression changes in a range of immune genes. in addition, the pattern of expression of many other genes provided evidence of an m. bovis-specific signature of infection. in the present study, we have used an expanded microarray platform to investigate gene expression differences that exist between infected and healthy control cattle in vivo, in the absence of in vitro antigenic stimulation. the results have yielded insights regarding the immune response to bovine tuberculosis, indicating that the expression of innate immune genes in in vivo infected animals is suppressed. this innate immune gene repression may limit the initiation of an appropriate adaptive immune response, which may contribute to progression of the disease. this study has demonstrated the involvement of a number of genes previously not associated with host defence or inflammation and has used stringent microarray analysis methods to detect and validate a robust gene signature of infection. the results highlight the usefulness of large-scale genomics approaches to detect biomarkers of disease and gene signatures of infection that in future may form the basis for novel diagnostics and/or therapeutics.

RESULTS
analysis of leukocyte cell population subsets and ifn-γ release from control and btb-infected animals
the infected animals used in this study were chosen on the basis of their large responses to the comparative tuberculin skin test. the ifn-γ levels measured in whole blood of the infected animals were at least 25-fold greater than in the healthy control cattle , demonstrating that the infected animals were generating strong cell mediated immune responses. at post-mortem, each of the infected animals displayed gross tuberculosis lesions and were classified as being in the advanced stage of clinical disease. to rule out gene expression changes that might be attributable to differences in leukocyte populations between infected and control animals, whole blood samples were subjected to haematological analysis. there was no statistically significant difference in total white blood cell  counts between control and btb-infected cattle . however, neutrophil counts were significantly decreased and lymphocytes were significantly increased in btb-infected cattle . lymphocytes represented  <dig> % of cells present in the total wbc samples from the btb-infected group, but only  <dig> % of wbc from the control group. a small reduction in the proportion of monocytes from 7% in the control animal samples to 4% in the btb-infected animal samples was also observed.

microarray gene expression profile in btb-infected cattle
microarray analysis of mrna was compared in the pbmc of six m. bovis infected cattle and six non-infected controls to investigate differential gene expression. the expression data generated from the microarray experiment were deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus  repository  <cit>  with experiment series accession gse <dig> 

of the  <dig>  duplicated genes on the botl- <dig> microarray,  <dig> spot features showed significant differential expression between the btb-infected and non-infected control animals at the p ≤  <dig>  level . of these,  <dig> were significant at p ≤  <dig>   . among the  <dig> differentially expressed spot features,  <dig> were significantly increased in expression in btb-infected animals , and  <dig> spot features were significantly reduced in expression in btb-infected animals  compared to control animal samples. this trend was replicated at the p ≤  <dig>  level .

 <dig> of the spot features represent  <dig> genes, where at least two replicate gene spot features were found to be significantly differentially expressed;  <dig> of these genes were identified as botl clones with no current gene match .

furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were expressed at lower levels in btb-infected animals compared with non-infected controls. among the genes reduced in expression with immune-related functions were prkcb <dig>  prkca, akt <dig>  akt <dig>  eef <dig>  eef1g, gata <dig> and ier <dig>  other genes normally associated with a proinflammatory immune response including csf <dig> , cd <dig> , ccl <dig> , chuk , nfkb <dig> , tbk <dig> , mif , ccr <dig> , bola  and bola-dra  genes all displayed lower expression levels in btb-infected animals relative to the control animal group .

messenger rna  transcripts for only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes showed higher levels of expression in btb-infected animals. most of these genes were est sequences, the functions of which remain to be elucidated. genes with increased expression and well characterised functions include the platelet-derived growth factor family, represented by the pdgfa and pdgfb genes  and ecgf <dig> . also significantly increased were g protein-coupled receptor family  <dig> members mchr <dig>  and gpr <dig> , a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily axl , a member of the ig superfamily cd <dig>  and the cytokine, ccl <dig>  .

fold change differences for differentially expressed genes on the microarray ranged from a decrease of  <dig>  fold  in the btb-infected cattle relative to control animals.

analysis of the microarray experimental false discovery rate 
investigation of the experiment-specific false discovery rate  using exact multivariate permutations tests based on  <dig> available permutations demonstrated that the probability of obtaining at least  <dig> genes significant by chance  if there are no real differences between the classes is  <dig> . furthermore, permutation-based analysis of the data using the significance analysis of microarrays  package with  <dig> differentially expressed spot features , demonstrated that only  <dig> of these  <dig> spot features were false positives .

real time quantitative pcr  supports a trend of innate immune gene repression in btb-infected cattle
an extended panel of  <dig> animals was used for real time qrt-pcr validation studies . the  <dig> genes represented by significant replicate spot features were classified using gene ontology . selected genes from each go class, supplemented with genes selected from relevant literature in human and murine models of tb were then used for these single gene expression studies are detailed in table  <dig> . real time qrt-pcr data obtained for the following  <dig> genes; eef1g, cxcr <dig>  ier <dig>  phb <dig>  stk17b, cd <dig>  mcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  tbk <dig>  akt <dig>  prkcb <dig>  nfkb <dig>  rps6kb <dig>  bcl <dig>  tnf, cd <dig>  and nfatc <dig> corroborated the botl- <dig> microarray results obtained using rna from the btb-infected and control animals' pbmc . the most notable difference in gene expression was observed for the nfatc <dig> gene where its expression was increased by more than 13-fold in pbmc samples from btb-infected cattle.

expression levels of a number of genes involved in pathogen recognition, such as tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  as well as cytokine genes were also investigated by real time qrt-pcr . the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> genes were expressed at lower levels in btb-infected animals compared with controls by - <dig>   and - <dig>  fold  respectively. adam <dig> expression levels were also significantly lower  in the btb-infected animals. gene expression levels for the il <dig>  il <dig> and ifng gene were not significantly different between btb-infected and control cattle groups , consistent with the microarray results. the interleukin  <dig> gene  was expressed at a significantly lower level in btb-infected animal samples . in contrast, the il <dig> gene was significantly increased in btb-infected animals  .

relative expression fold change values are shown with standard errors. also shown are p-values from t-tests between the two groups.

cluster analysis identifies a gene expression signature of btb infection
a hierarchical cluster dendrogram was constructed for the  <dig> animals screened with the botl- <dig> microarrays using the expression data from a panel of the  <dig> most significant differentially expressed genes . the results of this hierarchical clustering are presented in fig.  <dig> and further details for the  <dig> genes used are provided in table  <dig>  this analysis of the expression of these  <dig> genes differentiated between both animal groups and resolved the disease status of the  <dig> animals.

clone ids were obtained from the center for animal functional genomics  website  <cit> .

the  <dig> genes used for the cluster analysis, expression for four of which was increased in the infected animals, included some genes with functions that are not well described in any species. these include the nrm , zdhhc <dig> , ucp <dig>  and gan  genes. however, the panel also included well characterized genes of immunological relevance such as the fgfr <dig>  gene, the transcription factor nfkb <dig> gene and the tbk <dig> gene, a mediator of the action of nf-κb.

estimates of the experimental fdr using the sam package and permutation analyses showed that the probability of getting at least  <dig> genes significant by chance at the p ≤  <dig>  level, if there are no real differences between the classes, was  <dig>  . furthermore,  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were represented by two or more significant gene features in the original botl- <dig> data. the real time qrt-pcr verification performed for the nfkb <dig> and the tbk <dig> genes, both of which are represented in the infection signature panel, supports the reliability of this method for the detection of a gene infection signature for btb .

the accuracy of the  <dig> genes, estimated to be predictive of disease status in peripheral blood was further analyzed using leave-one-out cross-validation   <cit>  as implemented in brb arraytools version  <dig> . loocv analysis confirmed these gene predictors using a number of analyses including the diagonal linear discriminant, which classified the gene infection signature with a sensitivity and specificity of  <dig>  between btb-infected and control animal groups . from the  <dig> gene list, 100% correct classification rate was obtained for the expression levels of four genes: ncor <dig>  zdhhc <dig>  gan and an unknown gene represented by clone identifier botl0100013_f <dig> .

discussion
the inability of infected cattle to eliminate m. bovis suggests that the host immune response is inadequate to control infection in these animals. the specific immune cell signalling pathways that are involved in the immune response to intracellular infectious agents are highly complex and poorly characterized in cattle. although cell-mediated immunity is known to be critical for the control of mycobacterial infections; the role of the innate immune system has only recently been addressed in human and murine studies  <cit> . cells and molecules of the innate immune system play a fundamental role in the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, in phagocytosis, pathogen destruction, antigen presentation to t-lymphocytes that drive the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and the subsequent activation of an effective adaptive immune response. interference in, or suppression of these molecular mechanisms, due to a change in the balance of cytokines, or in the pathogen-induced suppression of cell regulatory pathways may be a decisive factor in determining the progression of m. bovis infection in cattle  <cit> .

the btb-infected animals used in this study displayed a significant 29% increase in the relative proportion of lymphocytes in their blood , accompanied by a small decrease in the proportion of monocytes . the production of ifn-γ after in vitro antigenic stimulation indicated the presence of m. bovis-specific t-lymphocytes in the btb-infected lymphocyte populations. however, despite the influx of lymphocytes, the gene expression data presented here did not reveal a proinflammatory immune response in pbmc from these btb-infected animals in vivo. in addition, the botl- <dig> microarray results showed that genes detected with decreased expression outnumbered genes detected with increased expression by a factor of two, suggesting gene repression .

estimation of the microarray platform-specific false discovery rate  provided information regarding the reliability of the  <dig> differentially expressed spot features detected using the botl- <dig> microarray platform under the specific experimental design and conditions. with  <dig>  genes spotted on the array approximately  <dig> and  <dig> false positive genes would be expected using standard statistical tests at the p ≤  <dig>  and p ≤  <dig>  levels respectively. however, because each gene on the botl- <dig> microarray is represented twice, individual spot features are not strictly independent observations. furthermore, the array is a targeted immunospecific platform, and as such, represents a subset of bovine genes that are known to participate in the immune response and ancillary processes. therefore, there is likely to be a relatively high degree of functional overlap and co-regulation, such that many of these genes are not strictly independent of one another. previous work has shown that the experimental fdr for a porcine brain microarray platform followed statistical expectations without the addition of a fold cut-off and that additional selection criteria could be used to virtually eliminate false positives  <cit> . taken together, the analyses of the fdr in this study suggest that the microarray data is reliable and that the fdr was lower than random expectations with the experimental conditions described.

ninety of the  <dig> genes represented by significant replicate spot features were expressed at lower levels in btb-infected animals . furthermore, the  <dig> genes examined by real time qrt-pcr confirmed the botl- <dig> microarray results and supported an overall trend of repression of the immune response, which may be manifested primarily through decreased expression of innate immune genes . reduced expression of key indicator genes, with well established roles in the bovine immune response to btb, associated with btb-infection was particularly suggestive of innate immune gene repression in vivo. the expression of toll-like receptor genes, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> was reduced by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively in pbmc from the btb-infected animals ex vivo . these results suggest that tlr expression associated with pathogen recognition and reaction to mycobacteria  <cit>  was suppressed in pmbc of animals with advanced btb infection. significantly, the nfkb <dig> gene, a central mediator of the proinflammatory immune response and a gene that encodes a mediator of nf-κb action  were both expressed at significantly reduced levels in btb-infected animals with p values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . in addition, the microarray data indicated reduced expression of chuk, a gene that also regulates nf-κb activation, , further supporting the trend of immune gene repression in the btb-infected animals. nf-κb is a key transcription factor for many of the genes involved in the immune response  <cit> , and as such may be a key mediator of the gene repression detected in pbmc from the btb-infected group.

the ccl <dig> gene, which encodes a cytokine that displays chemotactic activity for monocytes  <cit>  also exhibited reduced expression . two genes that encode members of the g protein-coupled receptor family involved in chemotactic t-cell migration, dendritic cell maturation and recruitment of inflammatory cells   <cit>  are also expressed at significantly lower levels in btb-infected animals based on the microarray data.

expression of the il <dig> gene, which encodes a neutrophil recruiting chemokine – a key mediator of the inflammatory response – was also reduced . this observation was consistent with the reduced nfkb <dig> gene expression in the infected animals; nf-κb is a well characterised mediator of il <dig> expression  <cit> . furthermore, despite the relative expansion of lymphocytes in the pbmc from btb-infected cattle , a majority of genes are expressed at lower levels with no change in the expression of the proinflammatory ifng, il <dig> or il <dig> genes detected using the botl- <dig> microarray or real time qrt-pcr .

recent studies of human tuberculosis infection demonstrate that mycobacteria can target cell-signalling pathways to regulate gene expression and subvert the host immune response . one particular study showed that mycobacteria specifically target the cd <dig>  molecule causing impaired dendritic cell maturation and induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote immunosuppression  <cit> . in addition, other work has suggested that immune cell signalling suppression may be mediated through tlr- <dig>  <cit> . both of these mechanisms could contribute to the survival of the mycobacteria.

previous work using mycobacterial infections has demonstrated differential expression of tlr- <dig>  tlr- <dig>  <cit> , inflammatory cytokines including ifn-γ  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit> , and bola mhc molecules  <cit> . in the present study, there was no discernible difference in expression for proinflammatory molecules between the btb-infected and control animal groups. this observation suggests that pbmc from btb-infected cattle display different gene expression program compared to both the healthy control animals and to pbmc exposed to m. bovis antigens in vitro  <cit> .

the differences in cell subpopulations shown between the btb-infected and control animal group  may contribute to some of the gene expression changes detected; however, the data presented here also supports the hypothesis that a host- or pathogen-driven process of innate immune gene repression in btb-infection in vivo is responsible for the progression of the disease. these results are consistent with recent work involving johne's disease in cattle caused by m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis , where suppression of the immune response was detected in late stage infection animals  <cit>  and a novel gene expression program was identified for pbmc in vivo  <cit> .

one of the aims of this study was to extract gene expression patterns that are associated with host-pathogen interactions, and that can be interrogated to identify a robust pathogen-specific molecular signature of infection  <cit> . it is clear that this approach could be problematic because natural gene expression variation for individual animals and their response to m. bovis infection has not been characterized  <cit> . however, gene expression infection signatures do hold promise; a recent study showed that human gene expression differences due to disease state were significantly greater than variation due to natural factors such as age and gender  <cit> . in addition, coussens and co-workers have established two genes  in a gene infection signature for johne's disease in cattle  <cit> .

the results presented here suggest that gene expression differences for key immune genes identified using the botl- <dig> microarray and verified using real time qrt-pcr play a role in disease pathogenesis and importantly, that these genes may serve as biomarkers for btb-infection status. cluster analysis identified a panel of  <dig> genes indicative of disease status in pbmc from naturally infected animals, in the absence of antigenic stimulation with tuberculin. in addition, results from class prediction analyses allocated a sensitivity and specificity score of 83% for these gene classifiers as predictive of disease status for the two groups of animals used. taking these observations into consideration, these genes may therefore represent robust and stable biomarkers for btb infection. we are currently investigating the sensitivity and specificity of this gene infection signature in a larger cohort of naturally infected and uninfected cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from the present study support a primary trend of innate immune gene repression in pbmc from btb-infected animals. additionally, a distinct gene expression profile that is predictive of disease state is evident, that also sheds light on the cell regulatory pathways associated with pathogenesis of bovine tuberculosis. however, it is important to note that different patterns of gene expression may be evident in tissues at the sites of active infection. also, some of the gene expression changes we observed may not be specific for m. bovis infection and may represent a general phenomenon associated with other advanced stage infections or pathologies.

this study highlights the importance of the natural host for m. bovis infection as a model to investigate the immune response to tuberculosis using functional genomics technologies. genes and cellular regulatory pathways involved in the bovine innate immune response to tuberculosis will likely show evolutionary overlap with mechanisms of response to m. tuberculosis in humans. these results also suggest that clinical strategies that target novel innate immune molecules might be useful in combating mycobacterial infections by shifting the balance between immune activation and suppression to favour the elimination of pathogens.
