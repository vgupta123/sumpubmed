BACKGROUND
the goat  represents one of the most important farm animal species. it is reared in all continents with an estimated world population of about  <dig> million of animals and about  <dig> breeds, which constitute approximately 12% of the total number of recorded domesticated mammalian livestock breeds of the world  <cit> . the diffusion of this species is mainly due to its capacity to supply milk, meat, and fibers for human consumption and use in a large number of different environments, including those poor of vegetation. in general, goat breeding represents an essential support for marginal economies in most developed and developing countries.

despite the importance of this species, studies on the goat genome are still in their infancy compared to those in other farm animal species. a first and a second generation genetic maps of the goat genome have been obtained by vaiman et al.  <cit>  and schibler et al.  <cit>  by mapping a few hundred microsatellite markers in half-sib paternal goat families, with about 90% genome coverage. the relatively short evolutionary time separating the goat from the cattle and sheep  <cit>  made it possible to use microsatellites developed in these two species to successfully genotype goats, even though interspecific priming often resulted in a marked loss of heterozygosity  <cit> . a comparative cytogenetic map of the goat genome has been developed using cattle and sheep bac clones  <cit> . this map has been improved adding many other physically mapped genes, as recently reviewed in a compiled list including  <dig> genes and  <dig> microsatellites, roughly including 65% of the goat chromosome bands  <cit> . comparative mapping between cattle and goat  has shown only few rearrangements in agreement with the similarity of chromosome banding  <cit> .

analysis of the goat genome provided a few important findings including the positional cloning of the polled intersex syndrome  locus located on goat chromosome  1q <dig> and determined by a deletion of  <dig>  kb containing mainly repetitive sequences  <cit> . additional studies have been focused on milk protein gene polymorphisms and their effects on milk production traits . polymorphisms in the goat prnp gene have been associated with susceptibility to scrapie in different breeds  <cit> . few other studies reported qtl for milk and fleece production traits and disease resistance  <cit> . investigations of genes affecting coat colour identified polymorphisms associated with this phenotypic trait  <cit> . in particular, the agouti locus in goat was shown to be highly variable including missense mutations and copy number variation   <cit> .

recent studies have shown that copy number variants, defined as intraspecific gains or losses of â‰¥  <dig> kb of genomic dna  <cit> , represent an important source of variability of mammalian genomes  as reported in human , chimpanzee  <cit> , rhesus macaque  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , dog  <cit> , pig  <cit> , and cattle  <cit> . cnvs can change gene structure and dosage, can regulate gene expression and function and for these reasons they have potentially more effects than the most frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms  in determining phenotypic differences  <cit> . cnvs can represent benign polymorphic variants even if in many other cases they are associated with human mendelian and complex genetic disorders . in farm animals, several traits are caused by cnv affecting genes or gene regions. for example, the dominant white locus in pigs includes alleles determined by duplications of the kit gene  <cit> . cnv also affects the agouti locus in sheep and goats and contributes to the variability of coat colour in these two species  <cit> . cnv in intron  <dig> of the sox <dig> gene causes the pea-comb phenotype in chicken  <cit>  and the late feathering locus in this avian species includes a partial duplication of the prlr and spef <dig> genes  <cit> .

genome-wide discovery and frequency evaluation of cnvs have been possible with the development of high-resolution array comparative genome hybridisation  and, subsequently, with data analysis of high-density snp platforms and paired end and deep sequencing approaches  <cit> . an advantage of acgh is that hybridisation can be performed using heterologous dna, i.e. genomic dna of a different species but close to that used to develop the array, taking advantages from completely sequenced, assembled, and richly annotated genomes. cross species acgh experiments have been successfully applied using human arrays to analyse cnvs in chimpanzee and other primates  <cit> , and using chicken based arrays to identify cnvs in turkey  <cit> , duck  <cit> , and zebra-finch  <cit>  genomes.

here we designed a cross species cattle-goat acgh experiment in order to identify cnvs in goats of different breeds  using information of the cattle genome and we obtained a first comparative map of cnvs of the capra hircus genome.

RESULTS
identification of goat cnvs and comparative analysis between goat and cattle cnvrs
the goat genome has not been sequenced yet and the cattle is the closest species to the goat for which an assembled genome is available  <cit> . in order to give a preliminary evaluation of the extent of sequence identity between these two ruminant species, we compared goat genomic sequences longer than  <dig> kb available in embl database with homologous cattle genomic regions. the average sequence identity between these two species was  <dig> % , that increased at  <dig> % if only exonic sequences  were considered . even if this rough evaluation cannot give a complete picture of sequence divergence between cattle and goat, it indicates that cattle-goat cross-species dna hybridization is possible as also demonstrated in physical mapping of cattle bac and yac clones to the goat genome and vice versa as well as by interspecific use of microsatellites  <cit> . therefore, to identify cnvs in goats, we carried out a cross-species acgh experiment using a cattle  custom tiling array including ~ <dig>  oligonucleotide probes and goat genomic dna obtained from  <dig> goats of four different breeds , chosen according to their differences in production and morphological traits, and origin . saanen is the most popular dairy breed that was originated in switzerland, highly selected for heavy milk production and with completely white/cream coat colour. camosciata delle alpi is an alp mountain breed of the chamois group. girgentana is a sicilian breed in an endangered status that is probably of afghan and himalayan origin, well adapted to the dry sicilian environment and with very mild behavior. girgentana goats have long corkscrew horns and cream/light-grey coat colour with, usually, a few small red spots around eyes and ears. murciano-granadina is a native spanish breed with two colour types, solid black or solid brown .

specific criteria were used to call cnvs in this cross-species acgh experiment. cnvs were reported using  <dig> different algorithms developed for data segmentation and averaging their results as implemented in the cghweb server  <cit> . the averaged log <dig> ratio threshold used to call cnvs was empirically determined considering the number of false positives called in the reference dna self-self hybridization and the validation obtained by semiquantitative fluorescent multiplex pcr  . applying these criteria, on the whole we identified  <dig> cnvs . the largest number of cnvs was identified in the saanen breed and the lowest number was reported for the camosciata delle alpi analysed goat. about 74% of the identified cnvs were observed in only one breed. on average each sample contained  <dig>  cnvs. this result is comparable to what has been obtained in similar acgh experiments that analysed the cattle  <cit> , dog  <cit> , and chicken  <cit>  genomes, in which  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvs were evidenced for each animal in the three species, respectively . two cnvs  were also called in the self-self hybridization providing a rough estimation of the false discovery rate  among the set of identified cnvs . however, technical issues, like sequence divergence between the reference genome and the hybridized dna and heterogeneity of dna quality among different samples, make it difficult to precisely estimate the experimental fdr. the estimated fdr using the self-self hybridization data in this cross-species experiment is a little bit larger than that obtained with homologous dna hybridization in acgh. indeed, in an acgh study in dog, fdr was about 3% due to only one cnv detected in the self-self hybridization  <cit> . however, in another experiment carried out in humans, fdr was estimated to be 8-24%  <cit> .

cnv regions  were determined by aggregating overlapping cnvs identified in different animals as previously reported  <cit>  and considering a conservative approach due to the specificity of our experiment . on the whole, we detected  <dig> cnvrs covering about  <dig>  mb of the virtual goat genome referred to the bovine genome, version btau_ <dig>  . this fraction corresponds to  <dig> % of the latter genome, considered adding bases in the  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome assembled in the btau_ <dig>  version . the chrunall  of the btau_ <dig>  version was not included in the tiling array due to difficulties in interpreting the results that might have been derived by the short assembled fragments and mapping uncertainty  <cit> . in addition, the tiling arrays included  <dig>  oligonucleotides designed on a portion of bta <dig>  derived from the umd bos taurus v.  <dig>  assembly  <cit> . this additional bta <dig> portion was included in the tiling arrays because the agouti signaling protein  gene was not correctly assembled in the btau_ <dig>  version of bta <dig> and was reported in unassembled scaffolds only. this umd  <dig>  bta <dig> region was added as an internal control because we previously demonstrated that the asip gene and the close s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase  gene are included in a goat cnvr  <cit> . this cnvr may represent a recurrent interspecies cnvr since the same two genes are involved in a large duplicated region in sheep  <cit> . considering this additional cnvr, on the whole we identified  <dig> cnvrs for a total of  <dig>  mb . these  <dig> cnvrs included  <dig> losses and  <dig> gains, whereas none reported both events. of these cnvrs,  <dig> were found in multiple animals of different breeds  or in multiple animals of the same and different breeds  or in multiple animals of the same breed only . all other events  were found only in one animal. the regions that were affected by these gain or loss events in goats ranged from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig> , <dig> bp  with mean and median equal to  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively . using a similar acgh experiment liu et al.  <cit>  reported that cattle cnvrs are on average a little bit larger than those we reported in goats . this is in contrast to fadista et al.  <cit>  who, using more dense arrays in another acgh experiment reported a median size of cnvrs equal to  <dig>  kb. mean and median differences between goat and cattle experiments might be due to i) the cross species experiment performed in goat that might not be able to correctly identify the borders of the cnvrs, ii) the oligonucleotide density in the acgh experiments, iii) true differences between species/breeds. it is interesting to note that the number of loss events was about two fold the number of gain events in both cattle and goat. this finding might be derived by both biological and technical reasons. non-allelic homologous recombination, which seems to be one of the most important mechanisms responsible for cnv formation, has been shown to generate more deletions than duplications  <cit> . on the other hand, acgh detection methods seem to favor the identification of deletions as reported by several other studies  <cit> .

additional file  <dig> reports the extension of cnvrs distributed for the different bovine chromosomes used in the comparative analysis with the goat genome. in only three chromosomes  we did not identify any cnvrs. bta <dig> included the largest number of cnvrs , whereas bta <dig>  bta <dig>  and bta <dig> included the largest extension of regions affected by cnvs  . in cattle a similar acgh experiment  showed the greatest enrichment for cnvrs on bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  and btax. comparative mapping and chromosome banding similarities between cattle and goat indicate highly conserved synteny between these two ruminant species even if a few rearrangements have been evidenced mainly on chi <dig> containing a small bta9q11-q <dig> segment, and some other gene order rearrangements for chromosomes chi <dig> compared to bta <dig>  chi <dig> compared to bta <dig>  and chix compared to btax  <cit> . cnvrs were evidenced in these interested chromosome regions. however, it is not possible to evidence if cnvs are precisely positioned in rearranged regions because of the low resolution of the rearrangements so far described between goat and cattle chromosomes due to the few mapped genes.

to evaluate if cnvrs we identified in goats overlap with cnvrs reported in cattle, we compared our results with those obtained in four independent cattle experiments  <cit>  carried out i) using acgh including ~ <dig>  tiling oligonucleotides  or ii) including  <dig>  million of probes  and iii) using the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip containing about 50k snps as reported by matukumalli et al.  and by bae et al.  . overlapping between acgh results obtained in goat and cattle was highly significant  for both cattle experiments . only two goat cnvrs matched cattle cnvrs identified with the snp panel  <cit> , therefore overlapping was not significant. a similar bias on the common cnvrs between acgh and snp genotyping experiments was also evident comparing the cattle data obtained by the two methods . this could be due to resolution and genome coverage differences between the two platforms  <cit> . however, merging all cattle cnvrs reported in the four different experiments , overlap with goat cnvrs was highly significant , confirming the results obtained considering the different cattle datasets separately .

as the goat genome is not sequenced yet, we could not evaluate if the goat cnvrs have similar sequence characteristics in goat and cattle. segmental duplications have been shown to significantly overlap with cnvrs in cattle  <cit>  as well as in several other species  <cit> . as segmental duplications might facilitate non-allelic homologous recombination, it is likely that they are as well involved in the mechanisms that produce cnvs in goats. the overlapping cnvrs between goat and cattle might represent homoplastic recurrent interspecies cnvrs probably driven by genomic regions prone to instability present in the cattle-goat common ancestor that might have been retained in the genomes of both extant species. indeed, cattle and goat share a common ancestor in the early miocene about 17- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . similar reasoning could be considered for the cnvr that includes the asip gene  <cit>  for which a recurrent cnvr has been reported in sheep  <cit> , but not in cattle. sheep and goat lineages separated about 6- <dig> millions of years before present  <cit> . significant overlap of cnvrs among different species has been also observed comparing the human with both chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genomes  <cit> . these two non-human primate species diverged from the human lineage about  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . together these results suggest that certain genomic regions are prone to recurrent cnv formation and instability in both the primate and the artiodactyla evolutionary lineages. however, a change in the formation process of cnvs and segmental duplications in the human genome might be occurred in recent evolutionary history  <cit> . it will be interesting to evaluate if this has occurred in other lineages. a comparative analysis of cnvrs identified in cattle, goat, and sheep can open perspectives to evaluate the evolutionary mechanisms determining cnv formation during the mammalian evolution.

validation and gene content of cnvrs
several results suggest most of our cnvs are correctly identified. first of all, the number of cnvs was lower in the analysed camosciata delle alpi goat . this was expected because the acgh reference was a sample of genomic dna of another goat of the same breed. similar results were also reported in mouse and dog acgh studies that used a reference genomic dna of an animal of the same breed/line of others that have been analysed for cnv discovery  <cit> . in addition, an internal control included in the design of the tiling arrays was represented by a portion of bta <dig> derived from the umd  <dig>  assembly that contains the asip and ahcy genes that we previously showed to be affected by cnv in goats  <cit> . all goats that were shown to have multiple copies of the asip and ahcy genes with different methods  <cit>  reported evidence of gain in the acgh experiment, compared to the reference camosciata delle alpi genomic dna. the results for this region were also used to set an empirical threshold to call cnvs by using the cghweb platform and multiple algorithms  <cit>  .

other three cnvrs identified on the goat chromosomes corresponding to bta <dig>  bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  were directly validated with sqf-pcr as reported for the asip and ahcy genes  <cit> . the cnvr of bta <dig>  included a gene coding for the gtpase, imap family member  <dig>  that was used to design the primers for pcr validation. semiquantitative fluorescent multiplex pcr confirmed the gain of copies already reported in the goats used in the acgh experiment and in additional goats of the saanen, girgentana and murciano-granadina breeds  . the evaluated cnvr of bta <dig>  was originally identified in a murciano-granadina goat by acgh . the bovine sequence coding for an unknown transcript  positioned in this region was used to design pcr primers for validation. however, analyzing the bovine genome by blat using the ensbtag <dig> sequence, a large number of significant hits  were obtained, and the hits included only sequences assembled in the bta <dig> encompassing the goat cnvrs no.  <dig> and  <dig> or included in unassigned scaffolds . these regions of bta <dig> have been already reported to contain cnvs in different cattle breeds  <cit>  . analyzing by sqf-pcr goats other than those used for acgh, we identified that this complex region  is affected by both gain and loss of dna copies that did not occur specifically in the evaluated goat breeds . therefore, even if these cnvrs were classified as gain  , they should be considered together as gain/loss cnvrs. cvnr no.  <dig> on bta <dig>  includes the nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group c, member  <dig>  gene . pcr primers were tested on additional animals as reported for the previous two cnvrs. only and all girgentana goats showed gain of dna copies in this region , including the three girgentana goats used for acgh analyses , even if the signal for one of them did not trespass the averaged log <dig> ratio threshold of  <dig> . the nr3c <dig> gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, which mediates aldosterone actions on salt and water balance within distal nephron cells, with crucial effects on blood pressure and potassium homeostasis. the protein acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to mineralocorticoid response elements in order to transactivate target genes. mutations in this gene in humans cause autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type i, a disorder characterized by renal resistance to aldosterone as well as salt wasting, dehydration, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and failure to thrive in the newborn  <cit> . defects in this gene are also associated with early onset hypertension  <cit> , whereas overexpression of this gene in forebrain decreases anxiety-like behavior  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that additional copies of the nr3c <dig> gene  could contribute to specific adaptation traits to harsh and dry environments and to the very mild behavior of the girgentana goats compared to other breeds.

the complete list of overrepresented go and panther categories is reported in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively, including details about the categories of the whole cattle genome  used as reference.

considering the  <dig> unique ensembl cattle genes included in the cnvrs identified in goats, for  <dig> we retrieved a human orthologous gene. mutations in only  <dig> of these genes cause mendelian disorders or are associated with genetic diseases in human . none of these  <dig> cattle genes is involved in any reported genetic disease in goat, sheep or cattle. among the goat genes already mapped  <cit>  only one  is included in a cnvr .

few qtl studies have been reported in goats so far  <cit>  and all used breeds/populations not included in our cnv study, except one in which a few saanen crosses were analysed  <cit> . in addition, the identified qtl have very large confidence intervals including most of the cnvrs we observed in several chromosomes . therefore a comparison among cnvrs we identified in goats, their gene content and qtl regions is not very informative. however, it is interesting to note that bolormaa et al.  <cit>  reported putative qtl for faecal worm egg and eosinophil counts on chi <dig>  in the region including the major histocompatibility complex , in which we reported two cnvrs, one affecting a mhc class i antigen gene  and the other one including mhc class ii alpha and beta chain genes  . in sheep, several reports have identified polymorphisms in the class i and class ii regions of the mhc being associated with resistance to nematodes  <cit> . it will be interesting to evaluate if these cnvs we identified in goats are associated with resistance to nematode infection and other diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a first comparative map of cnvrs in the goat genome using a cross-species acgh experiment based on the cattle genome. considering the limited number of analysed animals and breeds and the fact that the cross-species hybridization could have limited the detection power of this study, the reported goat cnvrs largely underestimate the true number of this kind of variation in the goat genome. additional studies including other breeds should be carried out in order to better evaluate the extension and distribution of cnvs in the genome of this farm animal species. however, it appeared that possible evolutionary conserved mechanisms might be the causative factors of putative recurrent interspecies cnvs between cattle and goat. using this cross-species design it seems possible to analyse several other genomes of the bovidae family in order to obtain comparative cnv maps in other species close to the cattle and provide additional evidence on the co-occurrence of cnvs in particular chromosome regions. several goat cnvs affect genes with important biological functions. further studies are needed to evaluate the functional relevance of these cnvs and their effects on behavior, production, and disease resistance traits in goats.
