BACKGROUND
most of the essential molecular functions of cells are governed by interactions of proteins with other proteins, nucleic acids and small ligands. computational studies of protein interaction data have helped identify protein-protein interaction ppi networks in various organisms  <cit> . similarly, studies on dna-protein interactions have allowed construction of transcription factor-gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in contrast, although several ribonucleoprotein  complexes have been extensively characterized , post-transcriptional regulatory networks that are mediated by rna-protein interactions  are much less well studied  <cit> . in addition to their roles in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, rpis regulate numerous fundamental biological processes, ranging from dna replication and transcription, to pathogen resistance, to viral replication  <cit> . recently, high-throughput experiments have provided evidence for large numbers of rna binding proteins in cells, and are beginning to identify and characterize pairs of rnas and proteins that participate in rpis  <cit> . at present, however, our understanding of rna binding proteins lags far behind our knowledge of regulatory dna binding proteins, such as transcription factors and replication factors.

computational studies of rna-protein interactions have largely focused on the "interface prediction problem", i.e., the problem of identifying the amino acid residues in a protein that are likely to bind to an rna  <cit> . only a few studies to date have focused on the "partner prediction problem", i.e., identification of specific rna interaction partner for a known rna binding protein, or protein binding partner for non-coding rnas . although large-scale experimental analyses of rpis such as rnacompete  <cit> , rip-chip  <cit> , hits-clip  <cit> , par-clip  <cit>  are now providing valuable data about networks of rna-protein interactions, these experiments are expensive and time-consuming. thus, there is a compelling need for computational methods to accurately predict rpis and to construct rna-protein interaction networks. given the limited number of structurally characterized rna-protein complexes available in the pdb  <cit>  at present  and the current availability of only one database of ncrna-protein interactions , it would be especially valuable to develop sequence-based methods that can be used to identify potential rna-protein partners in the absence of experimental structural information regarding either partner.

machine learning offers one of the most cost-effective approaches to constructing predictive models in settings where experimentally validated training data are available. at present, however, it is unclear whether the available experimental data regarding rna-protein interactions are sufficient for successfully training classifiers using machine learning algorithms. against this background, this study explores machine learning approaches to train sequence-based classifiers for predicting rpis.

RESULTS
as a first step towards computational construction of rpi networks, we focused on the following question: given the sequence of an rna-binding protein, can we predict whether it interacts with a given rna sequence? in developing sequence-based methods to answer this question, we considered several reduced and alternative alphabet representations of the input protein and rna sequences. shen et al.  <cit>  used a conjoint triad feature  representation to successfully predict protein-protein interactions. the ctf representation essentially encodes each protein sequence using the normalized 3-gram frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence . a recent study  <cit>  demonstrated the utility of the ctf representation for predicting whether a given protein is an rna binding protein. inspired by these studies, we chose to encode each protein sequence using the normalized k-gram frequency distributions extracted from the 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the sequence. the choice of k =  <dig> yielded the best results. we also explored several alternative representations of rna sequences and settled on encoding each rna sequence using normalized 4-gram frequencies extracted directly from the 4-letter ribonucleotide alphabet representation of the rna sequence.

our choice of random forest  and support vector machine  classifiers was motivated by several studies that have successfully used them on classification tasks that are closely related to the rpi prediction  <cit> . to rigorously evaluate the performance of these methods, we generated two non-redundant benchmark datasets, rpi <dig> and rpi <dig>  from pridb  <cit> , a comprehensive database of rna-protein complexes extracted from the pdb  <cit> . most of the rna-protein pairs in rpi <dig> correspond to rpis involving rrnas or ribosomal proteins; the rest correspond to rpis involving other ncrnas or mrnas. rpi <dig> corresponds to rpis extracted from non-ribosomal complexes in rpi <dig>  "negative" examples of non-interacting rna-protein pairs were generated by randomly pairing proteins with rnas and excluding the known interacting pairs .

rpiseq classifiers can reliably predict rna-protein interactions
we compared the performance of rpiseq-svm and rpiseq-rf classifiers to predict rpis, using the benchmark datasets described above. table  <dig> summarizes the prediction results obtained in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. on the rpi <dig> dataset, the prediction accuracy was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ; precision and recall for both classifiers was greater than 87%. on the rpi <dig> dataset, performance of both classifiers was considerably lower with an average accuracy of only  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . notably, values of the f-measure  were greater than  <dig>  for both classifiers on both datasets. thus, the performance of classifiers estimated using 10-fold cross-validation on the larger rpi <dig> dataset, which includes ribosomal data, is considerably better than that estimated using the rpi <dig> dataset, from which ribosomal data have been excluded. we also performed leave-one-out cross validation for the rf classifier. the results were not significantly different from 10-fold cross-validation experiments.

the performance statistics reported in table  <dig> were obtained using classifiers designed to provide high prediction accuracy. by varying the classification threshold value, the prediction specificity can be increased at the expense of a decrease in sensitivity. the corresponding trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate can be seen from the receiver operating characteristic  curve shown in figure  <dig>  consistent with the results in table  <dig>  roc aucs of  <dig>   and  <dig>   were obtained for predictions on the rpi <dig> dataset, with lower values of  <dig>   and  <dig>   on the rpi <dig> dataset. for both classifiers, the auc of roc is significantly greater than  <dig>  , indicating the feasibility of predicting rpis using only sequence information from the rna and protein as input.

comparison with other methods for predicting rna-protein interactions
bellucci et al.  <cit>  used a variety of physicochemical properties  of proteins and rnas to predict the interaction propensities for individual residues in the rna and protein sequences of a potentially interacting pair. because the catrapid server  does not directly report predictions as to whether or not a specific rna-protein pair is expected to interact , we were not able to directly compare our results with their method  <cit> .

pancaldi and bähler et al.  <cit>  also employed rf and svm classifiers, but their method uses more than  <dig> different features of mrna and proteins, extracted from the literature or computed from the protein and rna sequences to make predictions. examples of such features include mrna half-life, predicted protein secondary structure, gene ontology annotation, relative abundance of each amino acid, codon bias. using a dataset of  <dig>  positive mrna-protein rpi partners derived from hogan et al.  <cit> , and  <dig>  randomly generated negative examples of mrna-protein pairs, pancaldi and bähler reported an average accuracy of 70% in 2-fold cross-validation tests using an rf classifier based on  <dig> trees, and 68% using an svm classifier using an rbf kernel with optimized parameters  <cit> . they also reported that 5-fold and leave-one-out experiments gave comparable results. we performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments on the same dataset using rpiseq-rf, which uses only sequence information. our rf classifier achieved an accuracy of 68%, based on  <dig> trees, results comparable to the 70% reported for the rf classifier of pancaldi and bähler  <cit> . our svm classifier, using a normalized polykernel, gave less accurate predictions  than the svm of pancaldi and bähler   <cit> .

in the pancaldi and bähler study, only  <dig>  out of a total of  <dig>  positive mrna-protein pairs were actually used for prediction, because some of the features required by the classifiers were not available for the remaining  <dig>  pairs  <cit> . when we tested our method using all  <dig>  pairs for cross-validation, the prediction accuracies increased to 78% for the rf and 65% for svm classifier. taken together, our experiments indicate that the sequence-based method proposed here and the multiple feature-based method of pancaldi and bähler have comparable performance in predicting mrna-protein interactions. further, our results suggest that sequences of mrnas and proteins carry sufficient information to allow reasonable predictions regarding whether or not a given mrna and protein interact. because feature information required by the method of pancaldi and bähler may not be available in many cases, our proposed method complements theirs, and may be more generally applicable for predicting ncrna-protein partners, in addition to mrna-protein partners.

predicting ncrna-protein interaction networks
an important potential application of rpiseq is computational construction of rna-protein interaction networks. recently, nacher and araki  <cit>  used rpis from the npinter database  <cit> , a database of non-coding rna-protein interactions, to construct non-coding rna-protein networks for several different model organisms. their study revealed significant similarities between ncrna-protein and transcription factor-gene regulatory networks. to explore whether rpiseq could be useful for constructing networks of ncrna-protein interactions, we evaluated our method in predicting rpis in networks derived from npinter. because the npinter rpi pairs do not include any pairs derived from ribosomes, in this experiment, we also compared the performance of models trained on the rpi <dig>  versus rpi <dig>  to evaluate the potential effect of strong ribosomal sequence bias on performance.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the number of rpi pairs correctly predicted for each organism. when trained on the rpi <dig> dataset , the rf classifier correctly predicted ~ 80% . the output probabilities of rpiseq are estimates of interaction propensities for a specific rna-protein pair. in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the probability threshold used for "positive" interactions was  <dig> . among the  <dig>  interactions predicted by the rf classifier, only  <dig> were predicted with probabilities ≥  <dig> , and another  <dig>  interactions were predicted with probabilities in the range  <dig> - <dig> . the svm classifier generally had slightly lower performance, correctly predicting ~ 66% of the interactions.

in contrast, when trained on the rpi <dig> dataset, the svm classifiers out-performed the rf classifiers . overall, the svm classifier correctly predicted  <dig>   and the rf classifier correctly predicted  <dig>   of the interactions. among the  <dig>  interactions correctly predicted by svm classifier, more than  <dig> interactions were predicted with probabilities ≥  <dig> , and another  <dig> interactions were predicted with probabilities in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> . for the rf classifier, only  <dig> interactions were predicted with probabilities ≥  <dig> .

with regard to the effects of ribosomal sequence bias, these results are somewhat difficult to interpret. the best "overall" prediction performance was obtained using the svm classifier trained on the rpi <dig> dataset , with  <dig> % interactions correctly predicted; the rf classifier trained on the rpi <dig> dataset  correctly predicted  <dig> % of the total interactions. differences in performance of classifiers trained on the two different datasets are significant when predictions for each model organism are considered individually. for example, for d. melanogaster, substantially better predictions were obtained with an rf classifier trained on the rpi <dig> dataset  versus an rf classifier trained on the rpi <dig> dataset . in contrast, for predicting human and mouse rna-protein interactions, svm classifiers trained on the rpi <dig> dataset  provide the best prediction performance. for yeast rpis, both the rf and svm classifiers trained on rpi <dig> generated excellent predictions,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas classifiers trained on rpi <dig> made more errors, with correct predictions for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the cases.

one protein hub , which appears as a green square node with connections to several rna nodes , is apparent in these views of the network. it corresponds to the yeast sen- <dig> helicase, which is known to interact with several snornas  <cit> . several rna hubs, represented by red circular nodes, each connected to several green protein nodes, are also apparent. one of these rna hubs , corresponds to snrna u <dig>  which interacts with various sm-like proteins in the lsm complex  <cit> .

discussion
regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is often mediated by interactions between rna binding proteins and mrnas or ncrnas  <cit> . in this work, we present a new method, rpiseq, for predicting rna-protein interaction partners, using only sequence information, with up to 90% average accuracy. we also demonstrate, that rpiseq can effectively predict rna-protein interaction networks, based on evaluation using available data from five model organisms.

sequence-based prediction of rna-protein interactions
while several computational methods for predicting networks of protein-protein interactions have been developed  <cit> , very few studies have focused on computational analysis or prediction of rna-protein interactions  <cit> . one of the major challenges in solving the "partner prediction problem" for rna-protein interactions is the limited amount of experimental data currently available. unlike the "interface prediction problem," for which detailed structural information for more than  <dig>  rna-protein complexes is available in the pdb, mrna partners for only a handful of rbps are known  <cit> . currently, two basic types of information regarding rna-protein interaction partners are widely available: i) experimentally-determined structures of rna-protein complexes, available in primary resources such as the pdb  <cit>  and ndb  <cit> , and secondary resources such as pridb  <cit>  and bipa  <cit> ; and ii) experimental data from in vivo or in vitro cross-linking studies focused on individual proteins  or from high throughput rna-binding microarrays  <cit> , stored in repositories such as npinter  <cit> , clipz  <cit>  and rbpdb  <cit> .

rpiseq requires only sequence information to generate predictions. in the current version of rpiseq, the classifiers were trained using only rpis for which experimental structures are available. rpi <dig> is a non-redundant training dataset consisting of  <dig> interacting rna-protein pairs, and includes a wide variety of different functional classes of proteins and rna . rrna-ribosomal protein pairs constitute ~ 40% of the total, reflecting the predominance of ribosomal structures in the current version of the pdb. to investigate the impact of this bias on machine learning methods for predicting rpis, we also generated a smaller dataset of  <dig> rna-protein partners , from which all rrna-containing complexes had been removed .

we used rpi <dig> and rpi <dig> as non-redundant benchmark datasets for developing and rigorously evaluating the performance of various machine learning classifiers. in cross-validation experiments, classifiers trained and tested on the larger dataset had superior prediction performance, indicating that the greater number and diversity of complexes in rpi <dig>  relative to rpi <dig>  has a stronger positive effect on classification accuracy than the potentially negative effect of sequence bias in rpi <dig>  when we evaluated classifiers using independent datasets of rpis from npinter, however, classifiers trained on rpi <dig>  in some cases, had better prediction performance. the basis for this observation is currently under investigation.

to identify sequence features of the proteins and rna important in determining their specific interactions, we analyzed the features most frequently used by the random forest classifier to predict interacting partners .

the four most often selected rna tetrads were: auuc, agug, uuuu and ucaa. notably, these tetrads were found in the interfacial region in only 15% of the cases examined. the most frequently selected conjoint triad in protein sequences was {i, l, f, p}{a, g, v}{r, k}, which represents twenty-four possible amino acid triplets . the complete list of important rna and protein features is provided as supplemental data s <dig> . although additional experiments and analyses of these features will be required to extract precise "rules" that specify a particular rna-protein interaction, our current analysis indicates that at least  <dig> features  are required to accurately classify a given rna-protein pair as interacting or not.

in this study, rpiseq accurately predicted rpis in both cross-validation experiments using the benchmark datasets and in experiments on independent datasets. this suggests that normalized k-mer frequency distributions of rna and protein sequences  in combination with appropriate machine learning methods, provide an effective approach to construct rpi predictors. because the data used in this study represent only a small fraction of cellular rna-protein complexes and interactions, we anticipate that more accurate predictions will be possible when larger and more diverse datasets of experimentally validated rpis become available.

comparison with other available methods
the method of pancaldi and bähler  <cit> , which was developed to predict mrna-protein interactions , also uses rf and svm classifiers, but requires a much more extensive set of features regarding the mrnas and proteins. input for the classifiers, which consists of a vector constructed by concatenating the features of potential rna and protein partners , cannot be extracted or calculated from sequence information alone. this requirement restricts the applicability of this method in practice: pancaldi and bähler were not able to extract the necessary features for a majority of interactions in their rpi dataset. the rpiseq methods do not suffer from this limitation because they require only sequence-derived features to make reliable predictions. in fact, the performance of rpiseq improved substantially  when evaluated on the entire dataset of pancaldi and bähler. thus, for predicting mrna-protein interactions, the sequence-based approach implemented in rpiseq provides performance comparable to that of classifiers that require a more extensive set of features, including those that cannot be extracted from rna and protein sequences alone.

application of rpiseq to constructing rna-protein interaction networks
encouraged by the success of rpiseq in predicting specific rpis, we examined its effectiveness in constructing rna-protein interaction networks in several model organisms, using only information derived from rna and protein sequences. the networks were extracted from the "ncrna binds protein" category of npinter  <cit> , currently the only available database of functional interactions of ncrna with proteins. rpiseq was able to successfully predict the interactions of a single protein with multiple rnas , as well as interactions of a single rna with multiple proteins .

in the case of the yeast, s. cerevisiae, rpiseq provided excellent predictions of rpis: both the rf and svm classifiers trained on the rpi <dig> dataset correctly predicted > 98% of interactions in the npinter database  <cit> . the rpiseq-rf classifier trained on the rpi <dig> dataset also correctly identified a large majority of interactions in the d. melanogaster  and e. coli  networks. for human and mouse networks, however, classifiers trained on the rpi <dig> dataset gave better performance, with the rpiseq-svm classifier correctly identifying 83% of the interactions in human and 93% in the mouse. it is important to note that these evaluations are based on predicting only known "positive" interactions currently available in npinter  <cit> ; "negative" data regarding non-interacting protein-rna-protein pairs are not included in npinter. because the experimental data in npinter are incomplete, it is problematic to assume that rna-protein pairs not included in npinter do not, in fact, interact. also, some experimentally-determined rpis included in npinter could correspond to false positives.

given the relatively small sizes of the rna-protein networks analyzed in this study, differences in the results obtained using different classifiers to predict rpis in different species must be interpreted with caution. it will be important to evaluate these methods on larger, more complete datasets of experimentally validated rna-protein interactions as they become available. on the whole, our results suggest that rpiseq should be valuable for constructing and analyzing regulatory rna-protein interaction networks.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we tested whether rpiseq, a family of purely sequence-based classifiers, can be used to predict whether a specific rna-protein pair is likely to interact. our results demonstrate that the corresponding rna and protein sequences alone contain sufficient information to allow reliable prediction of rpis. such predictions can be used to:  identify putative rna partners of a target protein, or protein partners of a target rna; and  computationally construct rna-protein interaction networks. the datasets used in this study are relatively small compared with the large number of rna-protein complexes and diverse interactions that occur in cells. the increasing availability of transcriptome-wide experimental data should lead to improvements in computational methods for predicting rna-protein interactions and for modelling regulatory networks of rna-protein interactions. rpiseq is freely available as a web-based server at http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/rpiseq/.
