BACKGROUND
grape  is a crop of major economic importance. worldwide,  <dig>  million tonnes of grapes were produced on  <dig>  million ha in  <dig>  and wine trade represented a gross value of  <dig>  billion euros  <cit> . this high value crop requires adaptation to upcoming climate changes  <cit> . according to the least optimistic predictions, most major wine producing regions could become by  <dig> unsuitable for currently grown cultivars  <cit> . in addition, viticulture is required to reduce pesticides use, grapevine being one of the most intensively treated crops. it is therefore crucial to rapidly breed new adapted and resistant cultivars. in this perennial species with a long juvenile period, breeding is still a slow process although knowledge of the genetic determinism of agronomic traits is just emerging to speed up breeding through marker assisted selection .

v. vinifera domestication began in the near east 6000–8000 years ago  <cit>  and cultivars then found their way to most european, northern african and eastern countries through different routes. a large number of diverse cultivars  are used for fruit and juice consumption  and/or wine production . by contrast, a few relict populations of wild grapes  still occupy limited areas mainly in mediterranean countries. the possible contribution of western europe wild populations to the development of present cultivars during the diffusion of grapevine is still debated  <cit> . diversity and patterns of population structure have recently been clarified for cultivated grapes using molecular data . these studies confirmed the three genetic pools previously established based on morphological traits  <cit> : western wine, eastern wine and eastern table. in addition, deoxyribonucleic acid  polymorphisms have been very useful to refine this population structure through the identification of subgroups corresponding to specific geographical locations and ultimately to kinship groups  <cit> . cultivars constitute a complex network involving many close pedigree relationships  <cit> , indicating that the available diversity has not been fully utilized for breeding purposes.

compared to other crops such as corn or tomato, only a few quantitative trait loci  have been detected in v. vinifera, each trait of interest being studied in a single or very few crosses. the genetic control of major agronomic traits such as fertility, phenology, berry weight, seedlessness, berry phenolic composition and adaptation to abiotic stresses has been partially elucidated . however, the wide diversity in cultivated grapevine remains largely underexplored.

genome-wide association studies  in germplasm samples are more efficient than family-based mapping for qtl detection in highly diverse perennial species, in which producing and phenotyping large bi- or multi-parental populations segregating for different agronomic traits is very time-consuming and costly  <cit> . compared to qtl detection in such progenies, gwas in panels of accessions is not limited to causal polymorphisms segregating in parents, and provides a higher mapping resolution  <cit> . gwas indeed uses all past recombination events that occurred during the successive generations separating common ancestors from individuals in the study panel. gwas power strongly depends on  linkage disequilibrium  between causal polymorphisms and markers within the panel ,  factors related to panel design , traits  and causal loci   <cit> ,  statistical model used to detect associations  <cit>  and methods used to correct for multiple testing  <cit> .

since ld can largely vary across and within species depending on the individuals assembled in diversity panels  <cit> , it is of utmost importance to estimate ld extent in panels before applying gwas, in order to evaluate the density of molecular markers required to achieve a given power. simulating the power of association tests in such panels is very useful to delineate the range of trait heritability, minor allelic frequency, locus differentiation and qtl effect yielding efficient association detection. power simulation is also useful for choosing the best kinship estimator to maximize power without increasing false positive rate  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium extent has previously been estimated in v. vinifera, for both simple sequence repeat  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers. barnaud et al  <cit>  reported significant ld values between ssrs extending to 14– <dig> centimorgans  in a core collection of cultivars and to less than 1 cm in a wild sample . by contrast, ld decays much more rapidly between snps, with r <dig> values reaching  <dig>  within a few kb at most  <cit> . however, the variation in ld extent among genetic pools has not been explored in grapevine yet.

several v. vinifera subsp. vinifera core collections have been defined by maximizing global diversity, based either on morphological  <cit>  or genetic data  <cit> . they have proved useful for efficient screening of diversity, since they capture most extreme phenotypes or rare alleles . they have also been used in association genetics to test a few candidate genes . however, new genotyping technologies allow the development of association studies based on more relevant, larger-sized panels, representing more evenly the diversity from each of the three cultivated v. vinifera genetic pools. a genome-wide association study has already been applied to the united states department of agriculture  collection, which partially represents v. vinifera diversity  <cit> . however, an association panel optimized to capture the largest part of worldwide genetic and phenotypic diversity is still missing for exhaustive exploration of genetic determinism of numerous agronomic traits and genotype by environment interactions.

our first objective was to design a panel of cultivars suitable for gwas, starting from  <dig> unique cultivars in the grapevine germplasm collection maintained in institut national de la recherche agronomique  vassal. we used an original approach to take into account the existence of three genetic pools of cultivars while minimizing relatedness and retaining the main founders of modern cultivated grapevine. our second objective was to evaluate the diversity captured by this panel using  <dig> ssr markers and five phenotypic traits. our third objective was to analyze the effect of various factors on the power achieved by our panel for association tests, by estimating  linkage disequilibrium extent using  <dig> snps from four different  <dig> mbp genomic regions and  power to detect associations for traits varying in heritability and qtl effects. in addition, we studied diversity and ld in a sample of wild v. vinifera, to explore the possibility of performing gwas in the wild compartment.

methods
plant material
all plant material was collected at the vassal repository . this public national collection provides access to any plant material maintained, which is registered as living accessions with accession and cultivar numbers . all accession information, including id and passport data, is freely available on the vassal website. in this study, all tables listing plant material include these ids.

the experimental research reported here complies with institutional, national, and international guidelines concerning plant genetic repositories. no sample was collected in the wild for this study. all the wild accessions mentioned are ex situ accessions maintained in the vassal repository. the required material transfer agreement  was signed by the director of the vassal repository, authorising us “to use and store this material for research, experimentation, selection and training purposes”.

snp discovery panel
for snp discovery, we used sequencing data for a total of  <dig> accessions  including: i) a set of  <dig> cultivars, corresponding to a subset of the g- <dig> core collection defined by le cunff et al.  <cit> , ii) three other cultivars of economic interest  and iii) six accessions of the wild relative v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris, chosen for their typical wild ssr and morphological profiles. the grapevine genotype pn <dig> used for the reference sequence  <cit>  was added as a control.

association panel
we sampled an association panel of  <dig> cultivars selected from  <dig> unique cultivars in the vassal repository, following a procedure taking into account the genetic structure within the collection and minimizing relatedness between cultivars . first, we assessed the genetic structure within the collection using  <dig> ssr data from laucou et al.  <cit> . we discarded cultivars with more than 20 % missing data and we used the structure v <dig>  software  <cit>  with the following settings: five independent runs were performed for each k value ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> by  <dig>  assuming admixture and correlated allele frequencies, with a burn-in phase of  <dig> ×  <dig> iterations, and a sampling phase of  <dig> ×  <dig> replicates. we retained the k =  <dig> subdivision, which was relevant according to evanno’s method  <cit> , as found by bacilieri et al.  <cit> . this subdivision matched with the present knowledge about grapevine usage  and geographical origin  , while resulting in subgroups large enough for further sampling within each subgroup. second, from the  <dig> cultivars left, we selected  <dig> non- or low-admixed cultivars, belonging to one of the three subgroups  with a membership higher than 80 % according to structure results. third, within each of the three subgroups of this set, we identified the founding individuals as the ancestral or most widely used genitors. this identification was based both on historical and ampelographic knowledge, and on ssr-based relatedness analysis  <cit> , following lacombe  <cit> . we then complemented each subgroup up to  <dig> cultivars, using the max length subtree procedure implemented in darwin software  <cit> , which allowed well-balanced maximization of the genetic distance between cultivars. for this procedure, we used an unweighted neighbor joining tree based on the darwin simple matching dissimilarity matrix between the  <dig> non- or low-admixed cultivars. we finally removed the remaining first degree related cultivars using famoz  <cit>  and ml-relate  <cit> . we repeated these last two steps until we obtained a panel with three subgroups of  <dig> cultivars each.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the method used to design the association panel. ww: wine west, we: wine east, te: table east



wild panel
a wild panel was also selected among the accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris available in the vassal collection. after genotyping at  <dig> ssrs following laucou et al  <cit>  and careful exclusion of any possibly remaining inter-specific hybrids,  <dig> accessions , collected in a total of  <dig> locations, were selected to maximize both the number of geographical origins and the ssr genetic diversity using the max length subtree procedure of darwin software as described above for cultivars . due to loss of weak plants in the greenhouse, only  <dig> individuals from  <dig> locations finally composed the wild panel.

molecular analyses
dna extraction
dna was extracted from 200 mg of fresh young leaves or wood collected in the vassal repository, using the dneasy plant mini or maxi kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions except that 1 % of polyvinylpyrrolidone  and 1 % of β-mercaptoethanol were added to the ap <dig> buffer. dna was quantified with quant-it picogreen dsdna assay kits .

snp discovery
snp discovery was performed in four genomic regions of ca. 2 mb each , harboring qtls for agronomic traits: tannin content and composition on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , downy mildew resistance on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and berry weight on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . primer pairs were automatically designed in exons  <cit>  to amplify one specific amplicon of 400–1400 bp per gene, using an automated pipeline combining spads v <dig>   <cit>  and primer <dig> v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  softwares . within each genomic region, 55– <dig> amplicons were selected to optimize sequencing . small distances between neighbor genes were favored  to ensure that such distances were sufficiently represented. in addition, to estimate kinship between individuals,  <dig> amplicons regularly distributed over the whole genome were selected using a similar procedure.table  <dig> number of sequenced amplicons and genotyped snps

bnumber of amplicons containing successfully genotyped snps



for the discovery panel with  <dig> accessions, a total of  <dig> amplicons were sequenced in one direction, using the high-throughput sanger method described by philippe et al.  <cit> . raw sequence files  were passed through a pipeline using phred and phrap  <cit> . these sequences were then aligned together  and snps/indels were called, using pregap and gap shotgun assembly  within the staden v <dig> package  <cit> , followed by manual curation . final validated fasta files  are publicly available in the sniplay database  <cit>  .

snp selection and genotyping
to genotype individuals in the association and wild panels, a total of  <dig> snps were selected, excluding singleton snps in the four regions, and distributed snps with minor allele frequency  <  <dig> . priority was given to snps with illumina® scores of  <dig> , provided their flanking regions  produced only single hits using ncbi/blast® v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  against the whole pn <dig> reference genome sequence . in the four regions, we retained three snps per amplicon, over the range of maf values. for each amplicon distributed over the whole genome, we selected only one snp with the highest possible maf value, in order to optimize kinship estimation.

genotyping was performed using the illumina® goldengate® veracode® technology, with two oligo pool assays  of  <dig> snps each. after discarding individuals with low genotyping quality, respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> individuals were retained in we, ww, te subgroups and the wild panel . automatic genotype calling was manually checked with illumina® genomestudio v <dig>  software.

phenotypic analyses
the phenotypic representativeness of the association panel was assessed for five quantitative traits measured in the vassal collection : véraison and maturity dates , vigor, berry and cluster weight at physiological maturity. comparison between the association panel and the whole collection was performed using r packages ‘sm’ v <dig> – <dig>   <cit>  for density plots, ‘stats’ v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  for non-parametric mean equality tests , and ‘car’ v <dig> – <dig>  <cit>  for levene’s variance equality tests. a principal component analysis  was performed with ‘adegenet’ v <dig> – <dig> r package  <cit> . we also tested the effect of the association panel subgroup on each quantitative trait by analysis of variance  and kruskal-wallis rank sum test using the ‘stats’ r package, with the following model: yij = μ + si + eij, where yij is the phenotypic value of cultivar j belonging to subgroup i, μ the general mean, si the subgroup effect and eij the random effect. phenotypic data for the association panel are available in additional file  <dig> 

genetic diversity analyses
to assess the genetic representativeness of the association panel, several statistics were computed from the most recent data representing vassal diversity  using genalex v <dig>   <cit> . for each ssr locus, the number of different alleles , effective number of alleles ne = 1/ , observed heterozygosity ho and expected heterozygosity he =  <dig> - Σpi <dig> were calculated. they were then averaged over the  <dig> ssrs . to further assess differences in diversity between subgroups, ho, he and maf were calculated for each snp locus. all genetic diversity analyses were also performed on the wild panel to allow comparison with the association  panel.

assessment of population structure and kinship
to check the representativeness of the association panel for genetic structure based on ssr data, a pca was performed, as implemented in ‘adegenet’ r package. genalex was used to measure pairwise genetic differentiation among subgroups with ssrs or snps, using fst. relatedness and the proportion of first degree relationships  were estimated with ml-relate.

since genetic structure and kinship may be confounding factors in linkage disequilibrium and genome-wide association studies, corresponding matrices were calculated for the association and wild panels together, i.e. for a total of  <dig> individuals, based on a combined genotypic file including data for  <dig> ssrs  <cit>  and  <dig> snps distributed on the genome .

the genetic structure was calculated with structure v <dig> . <dig> software. since structure converged very quickly for this sample, we chose a burn-in phase of 5 ×  <dig> iterations and a sampling phase of 5 ×  <dig> replicates, and ran ten replicates of each assumed k-level subdivision . we used the model with uncorrelated allele frequencies and prior geographic information. both evanno’s method  <cit>  and the replicates similarity showed that the subdivision in three cultivated subgroups and a wild one was the most probable for the studied sample. the coefficients of membership thus obtained were highly correlated with those obtained for the initial set of  <dig> vassal cultivars with  <dig> ssrs . these ssr + snp coefficients were therefore retained for subsequent corrected ld estimations.

for ld correction by kinship, we used five different co-ancestry estimators, implemented in the cocoa v <dig>  software  <cit> : i) ais , the probability that the two alleles drawn at a random locus of each of two individuals are identical by state ; ii) wais , obtained from ais by introducing two correction factors to account for the mean probability that two individuals have an ibs allele that is not identical by descent ; iii) bno  <cit> , which uses a single correction factor for the same goal; iv) loi  <cit> , a modified correlation coefficient between mean allelic frequencies; v) mle . for bno and wais, either two or four unrelated groups were assumed, by distinguishing either between the wild and the association panels or between all subgroups , respectively. when analyzing the four subgroups  together, the wais <dig> estimator yielded the lowest mean corrected value of inter-chromosomic ld  . since true ld values between unlinked loci are expected to be null, we selected this estimator for ld correction in all subsequent analyses to minimize bias.

ld analysis
linkage disequilibrium was estimated in the four genomic regions between all snps with a maf > 5 %. we used the classical r <dig> estimate of correlation between genotypes and two recently developed estimates: one corrected by kinship  applied to each cultivated subgroup and to the wild panel, and one corrected by both kinship and structure  applied to the whole association panel  <cit> . these corrected estimates were calculated using the ‘ldcorsv’ v <dig> . <dig> r package  <cit> .

the expected ld value within each region was modeled as a non-linear function of physical distance according to hill and weir  <cit>  model. ld extent was defined as the physical distance corresponding to an expected ld value of  <dig> . the effects of maf, nei’s diversity index and annotation features  on ld extent were tested with anovas using separate models , which included the effects of subgroup and genomic region.

ld landscape within each genomic region was explored: i) through heatmap visualization , ii) by plotting mean r2v against physical position in a  <dig> kb-sliding window, with a  <dig> kb step, iii) by inspecting the ibs clustering of haplotypes estimated with the localized haplotype cluster model implemented in beagle v <dig>  software  <cit>  using ten iterations.

power of the panel for association genetics
we estimated the power of association tests provided by the panel at each snp according to rincent et al.  <cit> . the effects of snps on phenotype were tested using the wald statistic in the framework of the classical mixed model described by yu et al.  <cit> , which includes a random polygenic effect u to take into account dependencies between individuals due to relatedness: y=1μ+xlβl+u+e, 

where y is the vector of n phenotypes, μ is the intercept,  <dig> is a vector of n  <dig>  xl is the vector of n genotypes at the tested locus , βl is the additive effect of locus l to be estimated, u ~ n  is the vector of random polygenic effects with residual polygenic variance σ2gl, k is the kinship matrix, e ~ n  is the vector of remaining residual effects with variance σ2e, i is an identity matrix of size n, u and e are independent.

we estimated the power to detect association in our panel, at each snp locus in the four genomic regions. the trait had a known heritability h <dig> . each locus had a known effect βl explaining a fraction  of additive genetic variance. kinship k between individuals was estimated from molecular markers using different methods described above . to take into account multiple testing at  <dig> loci, we used a family wise error rate  value of  <dig> . to obtain the corresponding p-value threshold, we divided this fwer by the number of independent tests , estimated according to li and ji  <cit> .

RESULTS
diversity and structure of the association and wild panels, assessed with ssrs
the association panel designed from the vassal collection, composed of three subgroups of  <dig> cultivars each , fulfilled the joint objectives of representativeness and low relatedness. the ssr diversity captured in the association panel was representative of the diversity existing in the whole vassal collection . the total number of alleles was lower in the panel than in the vassal collection , with only rare alleles  not retained. ssr allelic frequencies were highly correlated between the panel and the vassal collection . the three panel subgroups accurately represented the three main divisions of the vassal collection along the first two pca axes . mean relatedness was already low in the vassal collection , and it was further reduced in the association panel . the proportion of first degree relationships was reduced from  <dig>  % in the vassal collection to  <dig>  % in the panel.fig.  <dig> pca analysis based on  <dig> ssrs for comparing the association panel with the whole vassal collection. other cultivars: the vassal collection but the association panel



the wild panel was found less diverse than the cultivated association panel and closest genetically to the wine west subgroup .

phenotypic diversity captured by the association panel
the phenotypic diversity within the association panel was representative of the diversity in the whole vassal collection for the five quantitative traits. the mean trait values in the association panel did not significantly differ from those in the vassal collection, except for véraison date . variance was significantly smaller in the association panel for two traits only , for which a very large proportion of variance  was captured. moreover, the phenotypic diversity in the panel spanned the whole range of phenotypic variability of the vassal collection, as illustrated by the pca plot .fig.  <dig> distribution of five phenotypic traits in vassal collection and the association panel. ww: wine west, we: wine east, te: table east. others: the vassal collection but the association panel



the panel was structured differently for these traits, according to fruit usage, geography or both. anova and kruskal-wallis showed a significant effect of subgroup on phenotypic variation of all traits except véraison date . subgroup explained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 18 % of total phenotypic variation  for maturity date, vigor, berry weight and cluster weight, respectively. for these traits, we also observed significant pairwise differences between subgroup mean values .

snp discovery and genotyping with opas
out of the  <dig> sequenced amplicons, 74 % harbored snps which could be successfully genotyped on all individuals . in this final set of amplicons,  <dig> snps were detected for a total of  <dig>  bp, i.e. an average of  <dig>  snp per 100 bp. this large diversity is consistent with the previously published values in grapevine  <cit> . out of the  <dig> snps selected for panel genotyping,  <dig> were discarded during manual curation of raw snp genotype data. finally, a total of  <dig> plants were successfully genotyped using  <dig> snps:  <dig> in the four genomic regions and  <dig> distributed over the whole genome .

selection of snps based on sequencing results in the discovery panel proved to be relevant, since maf values of the  <dig> snps successfully genotyped in the four regions were highly correlated between the discovery and association panels .

less than 20 % of the biallelic snps found by sequencing the discovery panel met all the selection criteria for genotyping with illumina® veracode®. this deficit arose mainly from polymorphism in snp flanking sequences, which prevented the definition of illumina® primers. snps were also discarded because of duplication of snp flanking sequences or too low allele frequency. the selection of  <dig> snps among the  <dig> non-singleton snps found by sequencing in the four genomic regions, introduced a small bias towards larger mafs . it also introduced a bias towards exonic regions, with 76 % of the  <dig> selected snps in exons vs 31 % of the  <dig> initially available snps. this unavoidable bias probably resulted from the larger polymorphism found in introns compared to exons, which decreased the occurrence of snps with monomorphic flanking sequences required for this genotyping method.

moreover, despite careful selection of snps for genotyping, only 65 % of the selected snps yielded high quality genotype data. this additional snp loss was due to more than three clusters suggesting potential copy number variation , insufficient cluster separation, small additional cluster, no amplification or monomorphism.

diversity of the association and wild panels, assessed with snps
the distributions of mafs and nei’s diversity indices showed differences among subgroups and genomic regions. for mafs, differences were significant  in the three subgroups  and for chr <dig> and chr <dig> . for nei’s diversity, differences were significant  in wine east and wine west subgroups  and for chr <dig> and chr <dig> .

pairwise differentiation between subgroups varied among genomic regions .

snp diversity averaged over the four genomic regions was significantly lower in the wild panel than in the association  panel, with nei’s diversity index values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

linkage disequilibrium assessment
comparison of ld extent between subgroups and genomic regions
ld extent for a predicted r2v of  <dig>  varied from  <dig> to  <dig> kb according to subgroup and genomic region . ld extent over the four genomic regions  for the whole association panel was  <dig> kb. according to this estimate from four genomic regions, the number of markers required to reach an expected r2vs value of  <dig>  between any causal polymorphism in the genome and the nearest marker was  <dig> , corresponding to one snp per kb on average. ld extent differed significantly among genomic regions , but not among subgroups . maf and nei’s diversity index significantly affected ld extent , whereas annotation features  did not .fig.  <dig> genotypic ld  modeled as a function of physical distance according to hill and weir  <cit> . ld was modeled separately in each subgroup of the association panel and in the wild panel, for each of the four genomic regions

the heatmaps of all pairwise r2vs values showed that the detailed ld pattern along each genomic region in the association panel was highly variable . mid-level r2vs values  were found between snps as far as  <dig> kb apart in some regions  whereas there was no ld between adjacent blocks of snps in other regions .fig.  <dig> heatmaps of genotypic ld  in four genomic regions in the whole association panel

haplotypic structures were very different between genomic regions , with especially large haplotypic blocks on chr <dig> and chr <dig> 

power of panel for association studies
we assessed the power of association tests provided by the panel at  <dig> snps within the four genomic regions, with different trait heritabilities, a variable part of additive genetic variance explained by snps, five different kinship estimators and a family wise error rate  of 5 % divided by the estimated number of independent loci .

whatever trait heritability and locus effect, ais kinship estimator resulted in the highest power to detect association, with a difference in mean power reaching 25 % between ais and wais <dig> for high heritability and large locus effect .

power variation between loci was mainly explained by heritability, qtl effect, and allele frequency. as expected, power increased with heritability, for a given part of genetic variance explained by the locus, whatever the kinship estimator  or genomic region . for a locus explaining 25 % of genetic variation, mean power over the  <dig> snps with ais estimator varied from  <dig> to 59 % when heritability varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . power also increased with qtl effect, for a given heritability value. relaxing fwer from  <dig> to 10 % led to increased mean power .fig.  <dig> variation of power distribution within four genomic regions . we used a family wise error rate of 5 %, ais kinship estimation and various heritability and qtl effect values



we observed a large variation of power among loci, which markedly increased with both heritability and genetic variance explained by the locus . as expected, power greatly increased with maf. detection power for loci with maf > 25 % and strong effect  could reach 95 % for a highly heritable trait with ais .

power was quite similar between the different genomic regions, except for chr <dig>  which showed the lowest power whatever the kinship estimation method. except for ais kinship, this difference was no longer observed when removing loci with maf < 5 % , indicating that it mostly originated from the higher proportion of rare alleles found in the chr <dig> region. it could also result from lower local differentiation among the three panel subgroups on chr <dig> .

power at a marker linked to a causal locus logically decreased according to ld between the marker and this locus; it could reach 31 % for an expected r2vs value of  <dig> , with h2 =  <dig>  and a qtl effect of 25 %, when using ais estimation and maf > 5 % .table  <dig> power of association tests at markers linked to causal polymorphims according to ld extent in the association panel, heritability and effect of causal polymorphism

discussion
design of the association panel
global genetic and phenotypic diversity captured in the association panel
our panel captured a large part of the genetic and phenotypic diversity present in the vassal collection. the panel contains all the non-rare alleles  at  <dig> ssr loci and shows a similar level of genetic diversity, as compared with vassal collection . we also observed the same distribution of non-rare allele frequencies and similar phenotypic means and variances. the vassal collection, which includes  <dig> unique v. vinifera cultivars  <cit> , is to date the largest and the most diverse and comprehensive collection of cultivated grape worldwide. the other largest v. vinifera collections in the world are those of encin  with  <dig> cultivars  <cit> , conegliano  with  <dig> cultivars , geilweilerhof  with  <dig> cultivars , fem  with  <dig> cultivars  <cit>  and usda  with  <dig> cultivars  <cit> . moreover, the vassal collection had already been curated for homonymies and misnamings, phenotyped for several years  <cit>  and entirely genotyped with  <dig> ssrs  <cit> . it was therefore a starting material of choice to derive a widely useful association panel.

advantages of the method used to design the association panel
an original method was used to design our grapevine association panel. our approach took into account the long-term historical genetic structure shaped by human selection for contrasting uses  and geographic adaptation . in these three genetic pools, we selected key founder cultivars of modern cultivated germplasm and removed closely related genotypes . this method yielded a sample with characteristics more appropriate for association genetics than core collections previously defined from the vassal collection, in addition to its larger size   <cit> .

this method ensured a balanced representation of all three major genetic pools in the final panel, by taking into account the genetic structure of the whole collection. in contrast, the previously defined genetic core collection  <cit>  over-represented the table east  genetic pool . this resulted from the combination of the larger diversity present in the te genetic pool and the sampling method used, which maximizes the number of alleles  <cit> . since the three major genetic pools correspond to different uses  and agro-climatic conditions , different alleles of interest have probably been selected among pools. therefore, their balanced representation in the panel is crucial to ensure sufficient power of association tests for potentially involved alleles.

our method also succeeded in limiting relatedness in the final sample, by decreasing it within each subgroup. this is essential in grapevine, where the large majority of cultivars in collections  are closely related by a first-degree relationship  <cit> . our panel therefore combined limited relatedness with the low structure derived from the three v. vinifera genetic pools. for association mapping, the ideal sample according to yu et al.  <cit>  should have minimal structure and relatedness, in order to yield the largest qtl detection power for traits not correlated with structure. for species where such samples are difficult to obtain, two main alternative types of designs are possible: i) samples with structure and/or relatedness, which require controlling for false positives in association tests, or ii) family-based designs with controlled structure. for instance, the latter possibility was applied to apple, with a large factorial design involving six parents  <cit> . in that case however, diversity and recombination number remained limited. more recently, nam and magic designs, based on larger parental diversity and more recombination cycles, have been developed in maize, barley and wheat . they represent an interesting compromise between association and linkage approaches, enabling the study of traits correlated with genetic structure in germplasm panels, even though to our knowledge power has not been compared between nam or magic and germplasm panels. in grapevine, creating such material would take a very long time, even using short cycle material , and would be very costly due to the space needed to maintain the numerous plants required. therefore, the association panel we selected from the largest germplasm collection already available is meanwhile probably the best solution, given its diversity, structure and relatedness features. controlled crosses could be used in complement to study the genetic determinism of traits correlated with genetic structure, with intermediary heritability, or with low frequency and/or effect of functional alleles  <cit> .

in addition, our method allowed recovering the same level of genetic diversity as in the vassal and genetic core collections , without the need to retain rare alleles as in core collections. this offers an advantage for association genetics, where the use of rare alleles is not recommended due to poor power and variance estimation  <cit> . moreover, our method yielded a non-rare allele frequency distribution in the panel not significantly different from the vassal and genetic core collections .

our sampling method is thoroughly described and thus applicable to other species. by contrast, sampling methods are rarely described in published reports of other plant diversity association panels. individual plants composing the sample are empirically chosen to try to best represent the diversity available in germplasm collections and/or breeding programs, often based on pedigree information, but without relying on an objective quantitative method. only a few studies mention the definition of core collections  or other methods such as pedigree analysis followed by the calculation of individual weighted contributions in soybean  <cit> .

our association panel of  <dig> cultivars selected from a germplasm collection is the largest ever defined in a perennial fruit crop. in fruit trees, since breeding programs are lengthy, there are usually far less unique genotypes available in germplasm collections than for annual crops  and a large part of these genotypes are closely related  <cit> . it is therefore crucial to optimize the design of association panels in such crops, as it takes a very long time to reach fruit set in a field trial. moreover, multi-site trials are probably the best alternatives to the problematic application of controlled abiotic stresses in field trials with unwieldy plants. these difficulties may explain both the very low number of association studies in fruit trees to date, compared to forest trees and annual crops, and the small size of association panels already defined in fruit trees .

the size of our association panel is comparable to the size of intra-specific diversity association panels in forest trees  or annual crops, despite the above mentioned drawbacks specifically linked to grape perennial status. in forest trees, a few panel sizes were above  <dig>  as for douglas fir  <cit>  and loblolly pine  <cit> , but most were between  <dig> and  <dig>  in annual crops, panels most frequently contained between  <dig> and  <dig> accessions, with the largest reaching about  <dig> accessions in maize  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and spring wheat  <cit> . since increasing sample size is one of the possible ways to increase detection power  <cit> , more variants with small effect or frequency could be detected with a larger panel. however, we would probably not be able to further increase our panel size without concurrently increasing relatedness, unless new genetic resources were included .

our association panel has a very low genetic structure , which is an advantage since structure is a confounding factor in association genetics. the low genetic structure already present in the vassal collection  was maintained while designing the panel, despite our discarding individuals admixed between genetic pools. by contrast, panels of other crops are sometimes much more structured, with up to a dozen subgroups as in sorghum or maize  <cit>  and some pairwise fst estimates as large as  <dig> , in rice for example  <cit> . in our panel, the part of phenotypic variance explained by genetic structure varied among traits from a few percent to more than 40 %, in the same range as in rice or maize  <cit> .

limitations of the association panel
the first limitation of our association panel is that it is exclusively composed of v. vinifera individuals. it will indeed be a valuable tool to search for alleles of interest for quality, phenology and yield-related traits. nevertheless, other species in the vitis genus exhibit larger variation for disease resistance or adaptation to environmental stresses. therefore for these traits, association panels will also have to be specifically designed for other vitis species.

a second limitation arises from the relationship between genetic and phenotypic structure for some traits, due to differential fixation of alleles among subgroups following diversifying selection and/or genetic drift. in such cases, some marker-phenotype associations will not be detectable in association tests based on mixed models correcting for structure. differentiation among subgroups will thus need to be considered  <cit>  and associations tested within subgroups. a phenotypic wine-table and/or east-west structure was observed in the panel for most traits. however, the percentage of total phenotypic variation explained by genetic structure was low , except for berry weight . moreover, as discussed above, genetic structure is limited in our panel.

ld extent
this study showed that ld between snps in grapevine may extend further than previously reported. in the association panel, decay of expected ld down to  <dig>  varied among subgroups and genomic regions, from  <dig> to  <dig> kb . this was larger than both the value of ca. 250 bp reported by lijavetzky et al.  <cit>  and the value of less than  <dig> kb given by myles et al.  <cit> . several hypotheses may explain this discrepancy. first, ld extended further on chr <dig> study region than in the other regions. second, previous reports were genome-wide studies while ours is based on four regions only. third, ld extent was estimated in different ways: hill and weir’s model in our study, non-linear regression in lijavetzky et al  <cit> , bin medians in myles et al  <cit> . fourth, in lijavetzky et al  <cit> , only intra-genic ld was measured, which might have influenced the regression curve. last, the possibility of some bias in our study due to the small number of snps in some genomic region x subgroup combinations cannot be ruled out .

variability in ld extent essentially resulted from differences between genomic regions. differences between subgroups were much more limited, even though ld extent was lowest in the table east subgroup, which is consistent with the larger number of generations that have occurred in this genetic pool  <cit> . the most noticeable feature was the larger ld extent on chr <dig> compared to other genomic regions. the excess of snps with small maf in this region was not sufficient to explain this discrepancy, since anova showed independent effects of maf and genomic region on ld extent . in the association panel, the larger ld extent in this region of chr <dig> is more probably due to selection for berry size during and after domestication. indeed, the larger cultivated-wild differentiation also observed in this region coincided with the candidate domestication locus reported by myles et al.  <cit>  and the berry weight qtl reported by doligez et al.  <cit> . we showed in this latter study that the region harbored a grapevine gene from a family probably involved in fruit size changes during tomato domestication. however, this assumption cannot explain the larger ld extent also observed in the wild panel in this region.

in the wild panel, ld extent ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and was not significantly different from the association  panel, suggesting equivalent possibilities for gwas. moreover, with both ssr and snp markers, we found a lower diversity in the wild sample than in the cultivated one, which is not expected in crops. our data therefore seem to reinforce the hypothesis that no strong bottleneck occurred during grapevine domestication events, as argued by myles et al.  <cit> . our results could also illustrate the genetic erosion undergone by the wild compartment, probably mainly due to anthropic pressure on natural habitat and biotic stresses, in particular phylloxera and mildews since the middle of the nineteenth century. in addition, the wild sample contains only western accessions, which could also result in lower diversity.

our ld analysis offers several advantages over previous ones in grapevine. first, the sample size is larger than in barnaud et al.  <cit>  and lijavetzky et al.  <cit> , with subgroups of sufficient size to prevent any ld overestimation due to small sample size  <cit> . second, we estimated ld separately in each of the three main diversity groups, using adequate samples, and could therefore compare ld extent between subgroups, which had never been reported before. no significant difference was found, which is consistent with the relatively short history of cultivated grapevine in terms of recombination  <cit> . third, we used novel ld estimates allowing correction for structure and/or kinship  <cit> . kinship correction appeared useful in our case, whereas structure correction did not. this was probably partly due to the very low overall genetic differentiation in cultivated v. vinifera, but also to the fact that the structure between wild and cultivated samples was already taken into account through the kinship estimation method used . last, the genotyping methodology used, coupled with manual curation of raw data yielded highly reliable genotypes. this is clearly an advantage over fully automated high throughput methods such as the one used in myles et al.  <cit> .

although it is particularly difficult and debatable to compare ld extent among species, our results indicate that ld decays far less rapidly in grapevine than in forest trees  <cit> , less rapidly than in arabidopsis  <cit> , and at a comparable rate to that in maize  <cit>  or rice  <cit> .

ld extent variability could be partly explained by maf and nei’s diversity but not by annotation properties. a large part of ld variation is still linked to unknown causes of variation among genomic regions, probably related to local selection or to differences in recombination rate or genomic structure.

power achieved by the association panel
since we estimated power at each locus considering that this locus was a causal mutation, we assessed the maximal power of our panel. when all individuals are not genotyped for all polymorphisms, panel power to detect associations depends on linkage disequilibrium between genotyped snps and causal mutations. by combining maximal power and expected extent of ld corrected for stratification, we obtained an estimation of power for markers linked to causal polymorphisms for different trait heritabilities and qtl effects . given the variability in the size of haplotype blocks along the genome  and in maf , local power may vary significantly around these mean values.

we observed large variation in mean power depending on the kinship matrix used in the mixed model, with a difference in power reaching 25 % between ais and wais <dig> kinship estimators. ais always yielded the highest power. this may result from a lower correlation of global kinship  with local kinship , which leads to increased power as shown by rincent et al.  <cit> .

the method we used for multiple testing correction  is quite conservative, although much less than the bonferroni method. using false discovery rate could be an interesting alternative to take into account multiple testing.

CONCLUSIONS
we defined and characterized an association panel offering the best operational representation of diversity so far for association genetics in cultivated v. vinifera. our estimates of ld and power of association tests in four genomic regions suggest that at least half a million snps will be required for efficient gwas in this panel. forthcoming genome-wide genotyping based on the 18 k illumina® chip  <cit>  or gbs  on this panel will soon allow a more exhaustive estimation of the range of marker density needed.

this panel achieves reasonable power to detect associations between traits with high heritability  and loci with intermediate allelic frequency  explaining a large part of genetic variance . this study illustrates that simulating power of an association panel on all or a subset of polymorphisms before conducting gwas, as in rincent et al.  <cit> , is very useful to rationally choose:  traits that can be evaluated in trials, knowing their heritability;  the maf threshold for removing markers that increase stringency through multiple testing correction without improving panel power;  the best kinship estimator to detect associations without increasing false positive rate;  the type and stringency of correction method for multiple testing.

highly precise phenotypic data are required for powerful association genetics. the association panel thoroughly characterized in this study is a valuable resource to be established in multi-site experimental trials. one research group is presently phenotyping this panel in a greenhouse in north-eastern france and another group has planned to set up this panel in south america. this panel could also be useful for genomic selection evaluation, due to its maximized diversity  <cit> , and it could even serve as a « universal » training population in v. vinifera genomic selection  <cit> .
