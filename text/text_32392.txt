BACKGROUND
bacterial genotyping has a recognized potential to support tuberculosis  control  <cit> . after initial diagnosis and before administered standardized empirical therapy timely detection of resistance mutations in the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis  can help clinical decision-making and support infection control efforts. further, combined resistance and lineage identification is especially interesting in areas where there is a high prevalence of multidrug resistant tb  and resistance is associated with specific lineages . the association between lineage type, patient outcome, and drug resistance needs to be studied to improve future control measures. unfortunately the benefits of strain identification are seldom optimally realized as mycobacterial genotyping, especially lineage identification, is almost always performed retrospectively on sampled isolates in high burden settings.

mtb evolves unidirectionally by the accumulation of mutations that are then fixed with no evidence of genetic exchange  <cit> . drug resistance in mtb is almost exclusively conferred via snps  <cit> . sets of snps and lsps have also been identified as suitable markers for lineage identification within the mtb complex . consequently, snp- and lsp-based assays are ideal for combined drug resistance testing and genotyping of mtb. we have previously developed and validated a bead-based multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  assay and demonstrated its potential to simultaneously identify a range of drug resistance markers, discriminate within the genetic group mtb complex , and detect and identify the clinically most relevant non-tuberculous mycobacterial species in cultured isolates .

mlpa assays or mlpa-like assays have been developed and reported by others for tb  <cit> , other infectious agents , human dna or rna . however, the bead-based tuberculosis-specific mlpa is unique in having a multiplexing capacity of up to  <dig> markers and combined detection of drug resistance and mtb lineage in a single assay. for high multiplexing assays a consistency check, i.e. the presence of sufficient markers and only markers exclusively from a single lineage, and streamlined data interpretation becomes increasingly useful and important as the numbers of markers screened increases. in previous reports we made use of a threshold value to classify fluorescent signals as positive or negative . this threshold was based on preliminary testing of dna from mtbc cultures and allowed accurate identification of the presence or absence of targeted markers in the majority of isolates tested  <cit> . however for signals that are close to the threshold automated interpretation of lineage types and drug resistance profiles can lead to a small proportion of unidentified false positives/false negatives which are not flagged as low confidence calls. as we perform a consistency check some of these calls will be identified, since many tb lineage markers are mutually exclusive, but for drug resistance markers this type of checking is not appropriate as mutations may occur in any lineage  <cit>  and multiple mutations can be present in different combinations. to overcome this issue different approaches have been applied; for example adjusting the threshold value for all markers individually, making use of the signal-to-noise-ratio  <cit> , reference genes  <cit> , or calculating allelic ratios  <cit> . here we have applied intra-sample normalization and inter-sample correction to allow low confidence calls to be identified and flagged for scrutiny. identifying intermediate signals allows only the high confidence calls to be classified as positive and negative. automated interpretation for profiles with only high confidence calls can then be trusted without the need to be reviewed by an expert.

the republic of georgia is reported as one of the  <dig> high-priority countries in the who european region with the highest tb burden  <cit> . additionally in  <dig>   <dig> % of all diagnosed pulmonary tb patients were reported with at least mdr-tb of which  <dig> % were infected with an extensively resistant tb strain. we collected samples from patients diagnosed with pulmonary tb at the national tb reference laboratory  of the national center for tuberculosis and lung diseases  in tbilisi, georgia. in addition to smear microscopy and chest x-ray, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing  and molecular drug resistance testing by genotypemtbdrplus assay  is performed routinely in this setting leading to the continuous reporting of mtb surveillance data. in contrast there are presently no typing methods established in this setting and epidemiological data regarding tb lineage type are only assessed retrospectively outside of the country .

snp typing can be complementary to whole genome sequencing  when applied to tb and other pathogens . whole genome high throughput sequencing is probably the ultimate technique for microbial genotyping but even sequencing a proportion of isolates evolving in a clonal population structure such as mtb and subsequent bioinformatic analysis  <cit>  will reveal snps uniquely associated with specific genotypes and will contribute to the optimization and interpretation of snp screening assays.

here, we report a strategy that we have developed to analyze, visualize and interpret snp-based data generated by mlpa while minimizing the required user input. we assess the degree to which the interpretation of the results such as resistance profile and mtb lineage can be confidently assigned.

RESULTS
the principle of the new data analysis method and the calculation of the correction factors is described in detail in the methods section and in figure  <dig>  the results obtained with the new data analysis method from dna of cultured isolates from individual patient samples collected at the national tb reference laboratory in tbilisi, georgia is illustrated in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

after mlpa data normalization, correction and automated calling, 4238/ <dig>  of the interrogated markers were classified as positive or negative . in total 62/ <dig>  markers were classified as intermediate. the  <dig> intermediate calls were not constraint to specific strains or specific targeted markers, which would indicate an underlying structural error in the analysis . in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains with intermediate calls these calls were confined to drug resistance associated markers. the remaining  <dig> isolates required expert interpretation for assignment to an mtb lineage. for  <dig> of the  <dig> analyzed isolates a full mlpa profile was obtained without review by an expert.

the results obtained from the mlpa and from the reference methods are summarized in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  the mlpa produced interpretable profiles for  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates tested using the new data analysis method . the mlpa genotypes were called without user interpretation for  <dig> isolates, after expert review for a further  <dig> isolates and one isolate produced a profile that was uninterpretable.figure  <dig> 
results obtained of the  <dig> isolates by various methods. samples were taken from  <dig> individual patients, all diagnosed with pulmonary tb and producing afb positive sputum smear; mlpa, dst, genotypemtbdrplus, spoligotyping and miru-vntr was performed on all  <dig> isolates. dst for first line drugs was performed on all  <dig> isolates whereas dst for second line drugs was performed on drug-resistant tb isolates only. dst results were not available for four isolates due to contamination of the respective cultures; no information was obtained from three isolates tested by genotypemtbdrplus; spoligotypes were not obtained for one isolate. unknown spoligotypes were obtained for  <dig> isolates and the spoligotypes of five isolates were not reported in the sitvitweb database. miru-vntr types were not obtained for  <dig> isolates. multiple copy numbers in one or more loci were revealed in two isolates; genotypic information of  <dig> markers screened per isolate was obtained for all  <dig> isolates by mlpa. for  <dig> isolates, lineage types could be assigned on the basis of consistent lineage marker profiles and in  <dig> isolates after expert review. for one isolate the lineage type profile was not interpretable. for  <dig> isolates molecular drug resistance was identified by mlpa of which  <dig> isolates had intermediate signals for at least one drug resistance conferring marker.



to evaluate the accuracy of this calling strategy, all mlpa results were compared to results obtained from other methods. we used spoligotypes to validate the mlpa lineage types and the genotypemtbdrplus results as reference standard to validate the mlpa data obtained for the markers conferring resistance to first line drugs; dst was used as reference standard to validate the mlpa data obtained for the markers conferring resistance to second line drugs. in addition we have assessed the association between drug resistance and mlpa lineage  and mlva clustering among all  <dig> isolates .

genotypic lineage identification
the genotypes identified by mlpa and spoligotyping are compared in table  <dig>  the mtb <dig> lineage was the dominant genotype by mlpa  of which  <dig> mtb <dig> isolates were further classified as latin american-mediterranean  and eight as haarlem. beijing was the second most commonly identified lineage , within which the mlpa identified four sublineages . these results were fully supported by spoligotyping for all but five isolates .table  <dig>

mutations obtained by mlpa are indicated for the respective genetic marker investigated with the genotypemtbdrplus assay; isolates for which no results were obtained by genotypemtbdrplus mlpa results for all genetic markers are indicated; an intermediate result indicates the presence of an intermediate signal and thus no presence or absence for the respective genetic marker; a = two isolates did not show a positive band with the rpobwt <dig> probe but no mutation probe was positive; one isolate did not show a positive band for the rpobwt <dig> and rpobwt <dig>  b = one isolate did not show a positive band with the katgwt <dig> probe but no mutation probe was identified.



of the  <dig> loci screened for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance  by mlpa in the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> could be compared to data obtained by the genotypemtbdrplus assay  loci compared were directly supported by the genotypemtbdrplus assay . one isolate was identified as isoniazid resistant based on the loss of the katgwt <dig> probe by the genotypemtbdrplus assay  and no mutation was identified by mlpa suggesting the presence of a less common mutation in katg. for the remaining  <dig> loci no results were obtained by the genotypemtbdrplus assay for three isolates  and for  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> loci intermediate values were obtained by mlpa. for the remaining eight  loci there was a disagreement between the mlpa and the genotypemtbdrplus assay.

the rpob-s531l mutation was the only identified rifampicin resistance conferring mutation within the mdr-tb isolates  both by mlpa and genotypemtbdrplus. for three mdr isolates no mutation in rpob was identified by genotypemtbdrplus or mlpa but the absence of rpobwt probes shown by the genotypemtbdrplus suggests the presence of a less common mutation in rpob .

current probes included in the mlpa for second line drug testing, target mutations conferring resistance to the injectable drugs amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin , capreomycin  or fluoroquinolones . mlpa identified resistance to amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin in two of six mdr-tb isolates resistant to kanamycin and capreomycin by dst . two isolates showed resistance to ofloxacin by dst, but no fluoroquinolone resistance was detected by mlpa in any of the  <dig> isolates.

dst identified  <dig> isolates with ethambutol resistance. a mutation in the  <dig> codon of the embb gene conferring resistance to ethambutol was confidently detected by mlpa in only four isolates all of which were also phenotypically resistant . additionally mlpa detected an intermediate value for ethambutol resistance in two isolates one of which was determined ethambutol resistant by dst . mlpa identified a mutation in the codon  <dig> of the rpsl gene conferring resistance to streptomycin in  <dig> of  <dig> phenotypically streptomycin resistant isolates  and in one the  <dig>  phenotypically sensitive isolates. in one of the  <dig> isolates that were phenotypically streptomycin resistant an intermediate signal for the rpsl- <dig> marker was obtained.

discussion
we believe that an easily interpretable, robust, high-throughput multiplex genotyping method such as mlpa can support infectious disease monitoring and control. critically unlike many typing methods snp-based genotyping is directly compatible with data generated by wgs/next generation sequencing . synergy between snp-based surveillance and snp discovery could be facilitated by cost-effective high throughput assays. moreover, routine screening of clinical isolates with wgs is currently not feasible in most high prevalence mdr-tb settings, while a robust and dedicated method like mlpa is more practical to implement. also, the read out platform used here, the luminex technology is relatively robust and suitable for other assays notably the newly developed tb-sprint method  <cit> .

as a result of the clonal population structure of the mtb complex, genotypic information such as snps and large sequence polymorphisms that are not under strong selective pressure can be used to identify specific genotypic lineages and are unique and mutually exclusive. indeed, many possible mlpa profiles are invalid, as mtb is clonal, a pure mtb strain will contain all and only genetic markers from a single lineage  <cit> . this allows an internal quality check, unlike classical typing methods for example is <dig> rflp typing, or vntr typing and to some extent spoligotyping  where virtually all profiles are theoretically possible.

here we have analysed a panel of  <dig> isolates from patients diagnosed with pulmonary tb and with positive sputum smear microscopy collected in  <dig> at the nctbld in tbilisi, georgia and used the data generated to evaluate a novel data analysis strategy. from the  <dig> isolates analyzed,  <dig> were confidently assigned to an mtbc lineage by our algorithm without expert interpretation. after expert review of the remaining  <dig> mlpa profiles only a single profile remained uninterpretable. the results of these  <dig> profiles were compared to reference methods.

previously we called positives on the basis of a threshold mfi  with no intermediate signals  <cit> . analyzing the data presented here using the threshold method would have resulted in  <dig> of the  <dig> characteristics being called positive and  <dig> negative. using our new data analysis method  <dig> characteristics were called positive and  <dig> called negative,  <dig> mfi signals were classified as intermediate. the  <dig> intermediate calls were distributed amongst  <dig> isolates, and  <dig> of the  <dig>  were markers related to drug resistance distributed amongst  <dig> isolates. of these  <dig> intermediate calls  <dig> would have been called positive by the original analysis method  and  <dig> negative . with respect to lineage identification the threshold method would have resulted in  <dig> inconsistent profiles in contrast to  <dig> profiles flagged for expert review  with the new data analysis method.

importantly, as we normalize with pre-established marker correction factors a single profile can be interpreted and no minimum sample size is required to validate the calls in contrast to other approaches  <cit> . those profiles containing of intermediate signals or those with a profile inconsistent with established lineage identification are flagged and need to be inspected by an expert. this approach means that samples with poor dna quality, experimental error or experimental variability are identified and not spuriously classified automatically. figure 2b shows that for each marker, when the mfi values are ordered from lowest to highest, for the  <dig> isolates analyzed each marker ideally follows a sigmoid curve with only very few values in the intermediate range – these are the intermediate calls.

in the georgian region a diverse phylogeny of mtb has been previously observed  <cit> . genotyping by miru-vntr, spoligotyping and mlpa of  <dig> randomly sampled isolates from this region here supports this diversity as well as allowing us to validate our assay by comparing the genotypes obtained by each method. spoligotypes were obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates of which  <dig> were unknown  in the sitvitweb database and five were not previously reported . for the  <dig> isolates for which an mlpa profile and known spoligotype was available  <dig>  matched. the one isolate with no mlpa profile available was “direct repeats” negative by spoligotyping. the  <dig> isolates with unknown or not previously reported spoligotypes were all classified to a specific lineage type by mlpa  these classifications were supported by miru-vntr .

genetic markers under strong selective pressure, most notably antimicrobial resistance associated mutations, may occur in multiple lineages  <cit> . some lineages have been suggested to be more associated with  drug resistance and therefore identification of some lineages may be particularly important for public health . data collected between  <dig> and  <dig> in the who european region and elsewhere shows that majority of mdr-tb isolates belonged to the beijing lineage  <cit> . an association of the beijing lineage with multi-drug resistance has previously been also observed in georgia  and in the study presented here a member of the beijing lineage was  <dig>  ×  more likely to also have an mdr profile than members from other lineages. in order to confirm these findings testing larger numbers of epidemiologically more representative sample sets needs to be undertaken. methods such as mlpa are suitable to undertake these studies; for example even in this limited initial study the beijing clone k <dig>  mlva type 94– <dig> was for the first time identified in georgia for four isolates two of which were mdr .

intermediate calls might indicate the presence of sensitive and resistant alleles. one isolate that was mdr-tb by genotypemtbdrplus had an intermediate signal for rpob- <dig> and embb <dig> by mlpa after data analysis, possibly indicating heteroresistance or mixed infection. further evaluation of the data analysis method is required to prove the ability of the current mlpa to detect heteroresistance. the acquisition of resistance during mdr-tb therapy has also been documented, as was detected by mlpa, in south africa and shown to affect the performance of molecular assays that detect resistance to second line drugs  <cit> . two studies report the occurrence of drug resistance amplification and patients infected with more than one genotype in georgia  <cit> . resistance amplification and re-infection with mdr-tb isolates could be partially accountable for the high failure rates in especially new tb patients in georgia  <cit> .

at present a limitation of the mlpa assay is that it is only suitable for use on cultured isolates but developments in real time assays appear to provide the possibility to perform an mlpa assay in a closed tube format  <cit>  which could dramatically simplify implementation.

CONCLUSIONS
at the nctbld in tbilisi, georgia, no method for extensive genotyping or strain identification was implemented prior to this work. therefore, lineage identification and phylogenetic analysis need to be performed outside of the nctbld. as a result of this study, the development of a transparent analysis algorithm, and associated staff training the mlpa method is now able to be performed on site and a report of the first year’s data is in preparation. even when performed locally on cultures, rather than directly on sputum, combined lineage identification and screening for drug resistance can provide much needed insight into the genotypic background of circulating drug resistant strains in a more timely manner.
