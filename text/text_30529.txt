BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  million people worldwide fell ill with tuberculosis  in  <dig> and  <dig>  million deaths were reported
 <cit> . worldwide tb ranks as the second major cause of death from an infectious disease. one third of the world population is estimated to be infected with m. tuberculosis , yet they remain asymptomatic. this is defined as latent tb infection 
 <cit> . only 66% of the tb-cases worldwide are correctly diagnosed
 <cit> . the gold standard in tb diagnosis remains the preparation of liquid cultures in selective media from sputum or tissue/body fluid specimens
 <cit> . this is followed by further mtb specific tests or drug susceptibility testing .

diagnosis of tb in most low- and middle-income countries continues to rely on sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli 
 <cit> . this technique detects only  <dig> – 60% of pulmonary tb cases and is not able to differentiate between mtb and other ubiquitous mycobacteria
 <cit> . this is less sensitive in children, hiv co-infected patients and in patients with extrapulmonary tb
 <cit> . the diagnosis of tb in developing countries is limited by equipment and infrastructure
 <cit> . therefore, in these countries, a simple diagnostic tool without the need for sophisticated instruments is needed. accuracy, simplicity, affordability and technical robustness are important factors for a point of care  tb-test. the main advantage of this is a rapid diagnosis, which allows initiation of treatment while the patient is still accessible
 <cit> . several anti-tuberculosis antibody detection systems are available. however the who recommended against the use of these assays because of their lack of sensitivity and specificity
 <cit> . direct detection of mtb antigens in human specimens would allow specific diagnosis of active tb to be made, independent of the host’s immune response. furthermore, the use of specific antibodies to mtb antigens in a lateral flow immuno assay  would potentially provide a rapid poc test in a cost effective, easy-to-use format. potential target antigens for poc tb-detection in human samples should be selected by the following criteria: substantial expression by bacteria in vivo, presence in the extracellular environment or on the mycobacterial cell wall, and resistance to degradation by host enzymes
 <cit> . the  <dig> complex is a major secretion product of mtb
 <cit>  which comprises three variant  <dig> proteins  that are encoded by three different genes . antigens  <dig> a,  <dig> b and  <dig> c possess mycoyltransferase activity and are involved in the formation of trehalose monomycolate  and trehalose dimycolate , which are components of the mycobacterial cell wall
 <cit> . besides the  <dig> complex there is another  <dig> protein, known as  <dig> d or fbpc <dig>   <dig> d shows structural similarity to the  <dig> complex proteins, yet does not possess mycoyltransferase activity
 <cit>  and its function remains unknown. disruption of fbpa results in the inability of mtb to replicate within macrophages, indicating a key role in virulence
 <cit> . furthermore, it was shown that  <dig> complex proteins interact with gelatine-binding sites of human fibronectin, enhancing complement-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages
 <cit> . antibodies specific for only one of the  <dig> proteins would allow for further investigation of their individual roles in the pathogenesis of tb. however only antibodies cross reacting with all other  <dig> complex proteins have been reported so far
 <cit> .

the presence of the  <dig> complex was demonstrated in human serum
 <cit> , urine
 <cit> , cerebrospinal fluid
 <cit>  and sputum
 <cit>  of tb infected individuals. this makes it a prominent marker for tb. although other mycobacteria express similar  <dig> complex proteins, these antigens could be used as tb markers in combination with other antigens to enhance specificity.

for the future development of diagnostic assays, recombinant antibodies generated by phage display are an alternative to polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
 <cit> . naïve antibody libraries allow generation of antibodies to epitopes which are not recognized by any immune system. in addition, recombinant human antibodies could be used in therapeutic applications. in this work, single chain fv  were isolated from a human naïve antibody gene library using phage display
 <cit>  and produced as scfv-fc 
 <cit> . these antibodies were further characterized and analysed for their suitability in an antigen detection assay targeting mtb  <dig> b.

RESULTS
selection of human antibodies against  <dig> b
for antibody selection, panning was performed on immobilized  <dig> b followed by a screening elisa using soluble scfv . finally, five unique scfv were confirmed by dna sequencing. the corresponding human germline sequences according to vbase2
 <cit>  are displayed in table 
 <dig>  all α- <dig> b antibodies contain a variable gene segment of the heavy chain  of subfamily vh <dig>  four binders have a lambda light chain  and one has a kappa light chain . all vlλ clones have a joining segment of the heavy chain  of subfamily j <dig>  a joining segment of the light chain  of subfamily j <dig>  and a variable gene segment of the heavy chain  of subfamily vh <dig> gene  <dig> 

abbreviations: hv variable  gene segment of the heavy chain, d diversity gene segment, hj joining  gene segment of the heavy chain, lv variable gene segment of the light chain, lj joining gene segment of the light chain.

cloning and production of scfv-fc 
the scfv were subcloned into pcse <dig> -higg1-fc-xp
 <cit> , produced in 50 ml scale and purified from the culture supernatant via protein a. the purified scfv-fc  were analysed by sds-page, silver staining, α-human igg immunoblot and reducing gel analysis via tape station. no degradation was detected . the purity of the obtained antibody preparations was determined to  <dig>  –  <dig> %.

validation of antigen binding
the antigen binding of the yumabs was analysed by titration elisa . the antigen binding was confirmed for all yumabs. antigen detection limits of the α- <dig> b scfv-fc were determined by antigen titration elisa . about 5 ng/ml were detected by mfu50-c <dig>  ~ 10 ng/ml by mfu50-a <dig> and mfu50-e <dig>  and ~ 30 ng/ml by mfu50-d <dig> and mfu50-d <dig> 

epitope mapping
to determine whether the antibodies bind to linear or conformational epitopes, the α- <dig> b scfv-fc were analysed by immunoblot . all antibodies recognized linear epitopes . epitope mapping of the α- <dig> b scfv-fc was carried out on pepspot membranes . through the overlap of the peptide sequences the epitopes were determined . the crystal structure of antigen  <dig> b was determined by anderson et al.
 <cit>  and the epitopes were visualized on the 3d structure of the antigen . the distance between epitope regions “afsrpgplv” and “spavyl” was computed to ~  <dig>  nm, between “spavyl” and “ssdpawern” to ~ 4 nm and between “ssdpawern” and “afsrpgplv” to ~ 5 nm. considering the width of an antibody , sandwich detection was likely targeting epitopes on different sites of the antigen.

cross reactions
sequence comparison of the epitopes of the α- <dig> b antibodies with corresponding sequences of the other  <dig> complex antigens provided information about possible cross reactions . the complete epitope “afsrpgplv” is present in antigen  <dig> a and  <dig> c, but not in  <dig> d. homologous regions of the epitopes “spavyl” and “ssdpawern” can be found in  <dig> a, c, and d. experimental study of  <dig> complex cross reactivity was carried out by indirect elisa . mfu50-a <dig> reacted with  <dig> a and  <dig> d. mfu50-d <dig> displayed a weak cross reactivity with  <dig> a as predicted. mfu50-e <dig> bound antigen  <dig> b weakly and showed no cross reactions. mfu50-d <dig> reacted weakly with  <dig> b. no reaction with the other  <dig> complex antigens was detected. mfu50-c <dig> was also not cross reactive. a summary of the expected cross reactions in comparison to determined cross reactions is outlined in table 
 <dig> 

*purified antigen  <dig> c was not available for immunological assays, nevertheless it is listed for completeness of the illustration.

detection of  <dig> b in mtb cell extracts and culture filtrates
the antibody binding to mtb/bcg cell extracts and culture filtrates was analysed by indirect elisa . in this assay only mfu50-a <dig> reacted with mtb culture filtrate and mtb/bcg cell extracts. the other antibodies bound only to recombinant  <dig> b. a weak cross reaction of mfu50-a <dig> with 7h <dig> medium was detected.

development of a sandwich elisa
due to the availability of five different antibodies with three different epitopes on the target antigen a sandwich α- <dig> b assay was performed. therefore mfu50-a <dig> , mfu50-c <dig>  and mfu50-d <dig>  scfv-fc were conjugated to hrp. sandwich elisa detection of the antigen was carried out with mfu50-a10-hrp, mfu50-c10-hrp or mfu50-d4-hrp as detection antibodies. capturing was conducted with corresponding antibodies recognizing different epitopes  on the target . blocking reagent only was used as a negative control . sandwich detection of the recombinant antigen was successful with all combinations. the antigen detection limit for capturing with mfu50-a <dig>  mfu50-c <dig>  mfu50-d <dig> or mfu50-d <dig> was determined to ~ 10 ng/ml, independent from the detection antibody. capturing with mfu50-e <dig> resulted in a detection limit of ~ 25 ng/ml. the most suitable combination was obtained with mfu50-a <dig> as the capture antibody and mfu50-c10-hrp as detection antibody-conjugate. mtb culture filtrate  was analysed by α- <dig> b sandwich titration elisa . this resulted in weak binding barely distinguishable from the medium control . mtb culture filtrate was further analysed by direct α- <dig> b elisa . in this assay there was no increase of the signal by increasing of sample volume. additionally, mtb cell extract was analysed by α- <dig> b sandwich titration elisa . this showed no binding distinguishable from the negative control except for the highest concentration . however, in a direct α- <dig> b elisa specific binding to mtb cell extract was observed .

effect of sample treatment on  <dig> b detection
the failed detection of  <dig> b in mtb cell extract in sandwich elisa compared to the successful detection in direct elisa was further analysed. it was hypothesized that the sample treatment, especially autoclaving, was the cause for differing antigen detection. cell extracts were prepared by autoclaving at 121°c for 20 min. the influence of sample pretreatment by heat on  <dig> b detection was investigated by direct elisa . when  <dig> b was boiled, antigen binding was reduced. further examination of the susceptibility of  <dig> b to heat was carried out by analytical sec. the theoretical molecular mass of an  <dig> b monomer was computed with the expasy prot param tool
 <cit>  to  <dig>  kda. the untreated sample of  <dig> b displayed a small monomer peak at  <dig>  kda and a dominant multimer peak with a molecular mass out of the measurement range but definitely greater than 669 kda . in comparison the boiled  <dig> b sample offered a dominant peak at the size of a monomer , multiple peaks with lower molecular mass and a few non-dominant multimer peaks . interestingly, aggregation was greater in the untreated sample than in the boiled sample. it was concluded that the aggregation improved sandwich detection, and if multimers were detected by sandwich elisa, the use of the same antibody for capturing and detection should be possible. experimental study by sandwich elisa  verified this assumption. in the untreated as well as in the boiled sample, sandwich detection with only one antibody was possible .

development of a lateral flow immuno assay
to develop a lateral flow immuno assay  all α- <dig> b scfv-fc were conjugated to 40 nm colloidal gold. sandwich  <dig> b detection was performed with all available antibodies for capturing and all antibody-gold conjugates for detection. the most suitable combination, mfu50-a <dig> as capture antibody and mfu50-d4-gold as detection antibody, was further analysed. a procedure that allowed sensitive antigen detection and low background combined with good feasibility was developed . the  <dig> b detection limit was determined by sandwich lfia to ≤ 5 ng/ml . mtb cell extract or culture filtrate  were analysed by α- <dig> b sandwich lfia. unfortunately,  <dig> b was not detectable in any sample in this assay.

development of an immunoblot assay for the detection of 85b
sandwich detection of antigen  <dig> b in mtb culture filtrates and cell extracts was complex in previously described sandwich elisa and lfia. as an alternative a direct α- <dig> b immunoblot assay was developed to avoid the challenge of sample pretreatment in sandwich detection. furthermore, mtb was cultured in sauton’s minimal medium and culture filtrates were concentrated to increase the antigen quantity. weekly samples were taken, concentrated  <dig> to  <dig> fold and analysed by reducing gel analysis via tape station and α- <dig> b immunoblot. no  <dig> b was detected in  <dig> and 16 days old cultures by either means . after 22 days a protein band at ~30 kda  was recognized by mfu50-a <dig> in immunoblot . additionally,  <dig> b expression was found in  <dig> and 70 days old cultures . the tape station and α- <dig> b immunoblot results for  <dig> and 76 days old cultures are given in figure 
 <dig> 

discussion
tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to bacterial infections worldwide
 <cit> . state of the art tb detection is mostly time consuming or needs expensive infrastructure
 <cit> . in developing countries, a rapid, cheap and easy to use poc tb test is needed
 <cit> . the who does not recommend the detection of antibodies against mtb
 <cit> . the only available assay for direct mtb antigen detection is that against mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan . however this test displays poor sensitivity apart from in patients with advanced hiv/aids
 <cit> .

in this work, we isolated and characterized specific antibodies against mtb antigen  <dig> b. these antibodies were proved suitable for  <dig> b sandwich detection in elisa and lfia. in addition, an mtb immunoblot assay was developed.

five unique antibodies were selected from the human naïve libraries hal7/8
 <cit> . the examined antibodies displayed homogeneity in the subfamily of the variable gene segment of the heavy chain . this correlates with the overrepresentation of vh <dig> and vh <dig> in the hal7/ <dig> libraries
 <cit>  and in vivo <cit> . four antibodies have a lambda light chain, one a kappa light chain. according to løset et al.
 <cit>  lambda scfv are expressed in higher yields in e. coli compared to kappa scfv, which may lead to an advantage in phage display
 <cit> . the antibody mfu50-c <dig> has a germline combination of vh <dig> and vκ <dig>  which is common in vivo and in naïve libraries
 <cit> . the lambda germline sequences present in the other antibodies are from the subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  subfamilies vλ <dig>  and  <dig> are dominant in vivo, whereupon vλ <dig> and  <dig> are rare in vivo <cit> . in the hal <dig> library vλ <dig> and  <dig> are more frequent than in vivo <cit> .

ferrara et al.
 <cit>  selected  <dig> antibodies directed against the mtb  <dig> complex in a combination of yeast and phage display. none of these antibodies were specific for an individual  <dig> antigen but, cross reacted with all other  <dig> complex proteins. landowski et al.
 <cit>  isolated an α- <dig> b chicken igy which cross reacted with  <dig> complex proteins. drowart et al.
 <cit>  generated seven monoclonal α- <dig> complex antibodies, which all cross reacted with other mycobacterial species however none were specific for antigen  <dig> b. this study shows the isolation of the first human recombinant antibodies  specific for antigen  <dig> b. furthermore four α- <dig> a antibodies  and three α- <dig> d antibodies  were generated . mfu <dig> -d <dig> was found to be specific for antigen  <dig> a and mfu51-b <dig> was specific for  <dig> d. these antibodies allow for the discrimination between individual components of the  <dig> complex. antibody phage display using human naive antibody gene libraries allows for the selection against non-immunogenic proteins and epitopes. we propose these epitopes, which would allow discrimination between the different  <dig> proteins, are not immunogenic. we propose this because of the fact that no antibodies, specific for one component of the  <dig> complex, were isolated by hybridoma technology
 <cit> .

easy applicability to in vitro assays was showed in this study by conjugation to colloidal gold or hrp. due to the recombinant nature of the explored antibodies, they can easily be altered to different formats, fused to different fc-parts
 <cit>  or fused to markers such as green fluorescent protein  for in vivo experiments. thereby the role of particular  <dig> proteins in mtb cell wall biosynthesis and evasion of the host’s immune response may be investigated.

all antibodies generated in this study recognized continuous sequences of the antigen, and the corresponding epitopes were determined by screening overlapping peptides immobilized on a cellulose membrane. mfu50-d <dig> recognized the epitope “afsrpglpveyl” and mfu50-d <dig> recognized the epitope “afsrpglpv”. this epitope region seems to be a potent t cell antigen since synthetic peptides including this sequence were found to induce cytokine release or immune cell proliferation in peripheral blood of individuals with varying tb status
 <cit> . however only weak human b cell responses against these peptides were reported
 <cit> . interestingly, no antibodies against this epitope were generated by immunization. in this work, human antibodies were successfully generated by screening phage display libraries, fortifying the advantage of phage display technology over conventional immunization methods. protein sequence comparison of the  <dig> complex proteins revealed the presence of the epitope in antigen  <dig> a and  <dig> c, suggesting cross reactivity. in elisa and immunoblot analysis mfu50-d <dig> showed no  <dig> a binding, however mfu50-d <dig> showed slight cross reactivity with  <dig> a. during this study  <dig> c was not available for examination. furthermore, a protein blast search  disclosed the existence of the entire epitope in several different mycobacterial strains , suggesting cross reactivity.

the α- <dig> b antibodies mfu50-a <dig> and mfu50-e <dig> recognize the epitopes “ssdpawerndpt” and “ssdpawern” respectively. landowski et al.
 <cit>  generated an oligoclonal chicken igy antibody against the peptide “ssdpawerndpt”  and demonstrated 55% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detection of circulating  <dig> b in human blood by an immunoblot approach. shen et al.
 <cit>  reported the synthetic peptide “gpssdpawerndptq qipkl”  was recognized by sera  of tb + individuals. similar peptides containing the epitope “ssdpawerndpt” were found to induce cytokine release or t cell proliferation in various assays with samples of tb + individuals
 <cit> . the entire amino acid sequence “ssdpawerndpt” is present only in  <dig> b of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis bcg. homologous sequences in mtb  <dig> a or  <dig> c and in  <dig> complex proteins from other mycobacterial species  differed primarily by substitution of one amino acid. cross reactivity of mfu50-a <dig> with mtb  <dig> a and m. bovis bcg cell extract and culture filtrate was detected by indirect elisa and immunoblot. landowski et al.
 <cit>  found a “ssdpawerndpt” specific chicken igy antibody to be cross reactive with mtb  <dig> a and  <dig> c as well as  <dig> complex proteins of m. avium. the reaction of mfu50-a <dig> with  <dig> a, b and d indicates a possible smaller epitope than determined by epitope mapping. the amino acid sequence “dpa” is present in antigen  <dig> a, b and c, but the adjacent amino acids differ. in  <dig> b the “dpa” is flanked by serine on the n-terminal site and tryptophan on the c-terminal site . in  <dig> a glutamic acid is n-terminal and tryptophan c-terminal . in  <dig> d serine is n-terminal and alanine c-terminal . it seems possible that the epitope of mfu50-a <dig> is “sdpaw” or “dpawe”, which would mean that two amino acids are different in  <dig> a or  <dig> d respectively. this would explain the weaker recognition of  <dig> a and  <dig> d. furthermore, the comparison of the 3d structures of antigen  <dig> a and  <dig> b  revealed that the glutamic acid in  <dig> b forms a pin structure in front of the “dpaw” region. this formation is missing in  <dig> a, instead of glutamic acid there is glutamine. glutamic acid can mediate strong electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bridges through the loaded carboxylgroup, whereupon glutamine is uncharged and can only mediate hydrogen bridges through the amino- and the ketogroup
 <cit> . thus, it is reasoned that the glutamic acid pin structure is needed structurally for correct docking, and physico-chemically for full strength binding to the antigen.

mfu50-c <dig> recognizes the epitope “spavyl”, which is close to the suggested active site of antigen  <dig> b
 <cit> , offering a possible inhibitory effect by steric hindrance
 <cit> . synthetic peptides including this epitope were found to induce cytokine release and t cell proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tb + humans
 <cit>  and antibodies against these peptides were detected in sera of tb + individuals
 <cit> . sequence comparison of mtb  <dig> complex proteins revealed no homology in this area. according to blastp equivalent sequences are present in several other mycobacterial species . no cross reactivity with  <dig> a and  <dig> d was detected by indirect elisa and immunoblot, suggesting specificity for antigen  <dig> b. surprisingly, no cross reactions with m. bovis bcg cell extract and culture filtrate were detected in an indirect elisa.

sandwich elisa detection of recombinant  <dig> b with the α- <dig> b yumabs was successful in all performed assays. the most suitable combination was capturing with mfu50-a <dig> and detection with mfu50-c10-hrp, reaching a detection limit of ~10 ng/ml. sandwich lfia detection of recombinant  <dig> b was successful capturing with mfu50-a <dig> and detecting with mfu50-d4-gold. a detection limit of 5 ng/strip  was evaluated. there are no published reports on single antigen  <dig> b sandwich detection, only whole  <dig> complex sandwich assays
 <cit> .

sandwich detection of recombinant  <dig> b was enhanced by multimeric antigen conformation, and reduced by monomeric antigen conformation. the small size of the antigen  may be responsible for this finding. considering the length of a human scfv of ~  <dig>  nm
 <cit>  and the fc-mediated homodimerisation of scfv-fc fusions
 <cit> , sterical inhibition by the capture antibody is possible. the commercially available immunochromatographic assays for mpt <dig> antigen detection in mtb cultures are sandwich assays with monoclonal antibodies
 <cit> . the capilia tb test kit
 <cit>  uses only one monoclonal antibody for a sandwich assay, indicating multimer detection. recombinant antigen mpt <dig> showed multimerization by disulphide bonds in two unrelated studies
 <cit>  and no difference in immunogenicity compared to native antigen
 <cit> . these findings imply multimerization of native mpt <dig> and that these aggregates are detected in sandwich assays. detection of  <dig> b in culture filtrates was only possible with mfu50-a <dig> in direct elisa and immunoblot. mfu50-a <dig> was cross reactive with  <dig> a and  <dig> d in elisa and immunoblotting. it has been reported to cross react with  <dig> c by landowski et al.
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work identifies the first recombinant human scfv antibodies specific for antigen  <dig> b selected by phage display from naïve antibody gene libraries . these antibodies allow the discrimination between  <dig> complex proteins, and showed suitability for the establishment of different assays for mtb  <dig> b detection. antigen conformation influenced by sample treatment was shown to be important. the presented antibodies are candidates for the future development of a poc tb diagnostic kit. however, for this purpose an affinity maturation of the antibodies would be necessary to improve the sensitivity.

selection of human antibodies using phage display
scfv were isolated in vitro from the human naïve phage libraries hal7/ <dig> by panning on decreasing amounts  of immobilized recombinant antigen  <dig> b according to
 <cit> .

production of soluble scfv antibodies for screening elisa
the identification of monoclonal binders was performed as described in
 <cit>  with the following modifications: 96-well polypropylene  micro titer plates  containing 150 μl 2xyt-g/a  were inoculated with colonies from the titration plate of the third panning round. micro titer plates  were incubated overnight at 37°c and 850 rpm in a mtp shaker . a volume of 180 μl 2xyt-g/a per well in pp-mtp was inoculated with 10 μl of the overnight culture and grown at 37°c and 850 rpm for two hours. bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at  <dig>  × g and 180 μl supernatant were removed. the pellets were resuspended in 180 μl 2xyt supplemented with 50 mm sucrose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin + 50 μm iptg and incubated at 30°c and 850 rpm overnight. bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at  <dig>  × g and 4°c. the scfv-containing supernatant was transferred to a new pp-mtp and stored at 4°c prior to analysis.

screening elisa
 <dig> wells of microlon mtp  were coated with 100 ng of recombinant  <dig> b in 100 μl pbs buffer ph  <dig>  or bsa in 100 μl pbs buffer ph  <dig>   as a negative control
 <cit>  overnight at 4°c. after coating, the wells were blocked with 300 μl pbst-b  tween- <dig> and 1%  bsa) for 2 h at rt. this was followed by three washing steps with pbst <dig>   tween-20). for identification of binders, supernatants containing monoclonal scfv were incubated in the antigen coated plates for  <dig>  h at rt followed by three pbst washing cycles. bound scfv were detected using mouse α-c-myc-tag 9e <dig>  followed by goat α-mouse igg -hrp  . after three washing steps with pbst <dig>  the reactions were visualized with 100 μl  <dig> ’, <dig> ’-tetramethylbenzidine  as a substrate. the staining reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl  <dig>  m h2so <dig>  absorbance at 450 nm  was measured using mrx elisa reader .

antigen in pbs at twelve dilutions  were coated in duplicates to wells of greiner microlon mtp at 4°c overnight. bsa coated wells were used as a negative control. after coating, the wells were blocked with pbst-b for 2 h at rt, followed by three washing steps with pbst. antigen detection was carried out with a concentration of antibody at half maximal saturation  in pbst-b for  <dig>  h at rt followed by three pbst washing cycles. bound scfv-fc were detected using goat α-human igg -hrp . the assay was further processed as described above.

direct elisa
analyte  was coated to the surface of greiner microlon  <dig> well mtp at various concentrations in pbs buffer overnight at 4°c. detection of antigen was carried out with an scfv-fc antibody conjugated to hrp  diluted in pbst-b for 1 h at rt. detection of antibody was carried out with goat a-human igg -hrp diluted  45 min at rt. the assay was further processed as described above.

sandwich antigen titration
100 ng of capture antibodies were coated to the surface of  <dig> wells of greiner microlon mtp in pbs buffer overnight at 4°c. after coating, the wells were blocked with pbst-b for 2 h at rt, followed by three washing steps with pbst. twelve dilutions of antigen in pbst-b were applied in duplicates onto the antibody coated wells and incubated for  <dig>  h at rt, followed by three washing steps with pbst. detection of bound antigen was performed with hrp conjugated scfv-fc  in pbst-b for  <dig>  h at rt, followed by three washing steps with pbst. the assay was further processed as described above.

epitope mapping
the protein sequence of  <dig> b  was divided into overlapping peptide fragments, each consisting of  <dig> amino acids, with an offset of three amino acids. this array of peptides was synthesized by the spot technique
 <cit>  on an aminopegylated cellulose membrane  as described previously
 <cit> . peptides are n-terminally acetylated and remain covalently attached to the membrane via their carboxy-terminus. the membrane bound peptide array was probed with the α- <dig> b antibodies for binding according to established procedures
 <cit> .

immunoblot
proteins were separated on 12% sds-page
 <cit>  and semi-dry blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. blocking was performed with mpbst  dry milk) for minimum 30 min at rt. subsequent incubation with protein-specific antibody was carried out in mpbst for a minimum of 60 min at rt. three washing steps with pbst <dig>  for 5 min were performed. the pvdf membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to hrp in mpbst for at least 45 min at rt. the blot was washed another three times with pbst <dig>  and then developed with tmb peroxidase membrane substrate  until an adequate signal was obtained. development was stopped by three short washing steps with deionized water.

lfia assembly + execution
 <dig> – 40 μl cm- <dig> of colloidal gold-antibody conjugates were dispensed onto 8 mm glass fibre pads  using the xyz-dispenser  and dried at 37°c. 1 μl cm- <dig> of different concentrations of capture antibody solution  or antigen  in pbs were dispensed in a line onto unisart cn  <dig> nitrocellulose membranes  that were already assembled onto 300 mm backing cards , and dried at 37°c. the glass fibre conjugate pads were laminated onto the backing cards, overlapping the nitrocellulose membrane at the connection point for ~  <dig>  – 1 mm. then cellulose fibre pads  were laminated onto the backing cards as sample and wicking pad, overlapping the nitrocellulose membrane at the connection point for ~  <dig>  – 1 mm. the assembled cards were cut into strips of  <dig>  cm width with the cm <dig> guillotine-cutter  and the test strips were placed into lateral flow strip test  cassettes .

several experiments were carried out to determine a procedure that would allow sensitive antigen detection and a low background combined with good feasibility . the best option for a manageable lfia was to add a diluent to the sample before applying it to the sample well. therefore 1/ <dig> sample volume  of conjugation buffer  enriched with 8%  bsa were mixed with 100 μl sample and applied to the lfia. after  <dig> – 20 min results were optically evaluated.

yumab production + purification
all scfv isolated from antibody-phage display were subcloned into pcse <dig> -higg1-fc-xp and produced as scfv-fc  in hek293-6e cells , biotechnological research institute , montreal, canada). hek293-6e cells were cultured in chemical defined f <dig> medium  supplemented with 1 g/l pluronic f <dig> , 4 mm l-glutamine  and 25 mg/l g <dig>  as previously described
 <cit> . dna was transiently transfected into 25 ml hek293-6e cells in 125 ml erlenmeyer shake flasks. after 48 hours of cultivation at  <dig> rounds per minute  in a minitron orbital shaker  at 37°c and 5% co <dig> atmosphere, one volume culture medium and a final concentration of  <dig> %  of tryptone n <dig>  were added. scfv-fc were purified via unosphere supra column  using a profinia automate , according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

analytical sec
for analytical size exclusion chromatography  a knauer platinblue hplc plus system  with a superdex  <dig> 10/ <dig> gl column  was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the column was equilibrated with the gel filtration hmw/lmw calibration kits  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

tape station
protein solutions were analysed with the screen tape p <dig> protein standard kit  under reducing conditions on a  <dig> tape station system  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the “p <dig> molecular weight standard”  was used as a molecular marker.
