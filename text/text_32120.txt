BACKGROUND
type i collagen and proteolytic cleavage products of dentin sialophosphoprotein  are the predominant proteins in tooth dentin. collagen constitutes about 90% of the dentin organic matrix  <cit> , while dspp-derived proteins make up more than half of the dentin noncollagenous proteins  <cit> . genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of the genes encoding type i collagen  and dspp  for proper human dentin formation. inherited dentin defects are classified as dentinogenesis imperfecta  types i, ii, or iii, or dentin dysplasia  types i and ii  <cit> . dgi type i is osteogenesis imperfecta with dentinogenesis imperfecta and is caused by mutations in col1a <dig> and col1a <dig>  <cit> . dd type ii and dgi types ii and type iii are caused by mutations in dspp  <cit> . there are other potential candidate genes for these disorders, but only dspp mutations have been found in dd or dgi kindreds  <cit> .

dentin sialophosphoprotein  is a chimeric protein that is cleaved by proteases into its component parts  <cit> , which are considered to be two parts in rodents and three in pig. the order of the major domains of dspp is dsp-dgp-dpp, where dsp is dentin sialoprotein, dgp is dentin glycoprotein, and dpp is dentin phosphoprotein. dspp is expressed predominantly by odontoblasts  <cit> , but is detected in bone at trace levels   <cit> . currently, the human expressed sequence tag database for dspp expression  shows zero dspp transcripts out of  <dig>  total mrna transcripts characterized from bone.

dspp is a member of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein  genes, which are involved in the mineralization of bone, dentin, and enamel  <cit> . the scpp family initially arose from a single ancestral gene: sparcl <dig> or secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich like  <dig> gene  <cit> . the common features of scpp genes are few: their second exon encodes a short signal peptide  plus the first two amino acids of the secreted protein. the second coding exon generally encodes a phosphorylation site sxe/s for golgi casein kinase  <cit> . all of the introns are type  <dig>  that is, the introns do not interrupt codons but are all placed between codon triplets. the scpps divide into two groups based upon their distinctive amino acid compositions. acidic scpps are rich  in glutamate, aspartate, and phosphoserine. proline and glutamine-rich scpps are more than 20% proline and glutamine. dspp belongs to the acidic group, which is also known as the dentin/bone group or the siblings, for small integrin-binding ligand, n-linked glycoproteins  <cit> .

the second coding exon for dspp  is unusual for the scpp family. in the pig, this exon encodes the protein segment from val <dig> to gln <dig>  none of the amino acids encoded by exon  <dig> are in the appropriate context for phosphorylation or glycosylation. skipping exon  <dig> would not alter the reading frame, but human mutations that cause the skipping of exon  <dig> cause dominant negative effects that result in dentin malformations, possibly due to failure to recognize or cleave the signal peptide  <cit> . all six of the reported intronic mutations in dspp that cause inherited dentin defects are at the end of intron  <dig>  <cit>  or beginning of intron  <dig>  <cit> . perhaps exon  <dig> was acquired by exon capture after the dspp ancestral gene duplicated from another scpp gene and is not descended from the short prototypical second coding exon that encodes a serine that gets phosphorylated.

exon  <dig> encodes the bulk of dentin sialoprotein , from asp <dig> to lys <dig>  <cit> . previously we isolated and characterized a porcine "dsp only" transcript. this mrna transcript terminated at a polyadenylation/cleavage site in intron  <dig>  <cit> . the porcine dsp cleavage product  of dspp is a highly glycosylated proteoglycan that forms covalent dimers  <cit> . the dgp cleavage product  of dspp is encoded by the 5' part of exon  <dig>  dgp, which has so far only been described in pig, has a single glycosylation  and four phosphoserines  that are in a highly conserved region near its carboxyl-terminus  <cit> . dentin phosphoprotein  is the highly phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of dspp, and is encoded by the rest of exon  <dig>  the coding region of dpp varies in length among different individuals without affecting function  <cit> . astacin proteases, such as bmp- <dig> cleave dpp from dspp  <cit> , while mmp- <dig> separates dsp and dgp  <cit> .

dentin sialoprotein  was previously thought to be only a minor component of dentin, perhaps only 10% as abundant as dentin phosphoprotein   <cit> , and later thought to be a nonfunctional pro-domain that was removed by proteases to activate dpp  <cit> . recently, however it has been determined that dsp and dpp are expressed in stoichiometric amounts as the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of dspp  <cit>  and are found in equal molar amounts in dentin  <cit> . dspp null mice show severe dentin malformations that resemble those observed in human dgi-iii  <cit> . transgenic expression of the dsp domain in the dspp null background partially, but substantially, restores the dentin phenotype  <cit> . the widening of predentin observed in the dspp knockout as well as the reduced volume of mineralized dentin are recovered, indicating that both dsp and dpp are necessary for normal dentin mineralization. the mechanisms through which dsp contributes to dentin formation are unknown. characterization of its posttranslational modifications  is an important step in understanding its function.

RESULTS
characterization of dsp carbohydrate attachment sites
we previously showed that porcine dsp is a proteoglycan  <cit>  and that porcine dentin extracts contain the intact dsp , as well as lower molecular weight  cleavage products of dsp  <cit> . it was also known that dsp has glycosylations rich in sialic acid  <cit>  and that porcine dsp has eight potential n-glycosylation sites based upon analysis of its primary amino acid sequence  <cit> . to identify attachment sites and to better characterize the glycosaminoglycan  and other carbohydrate attachments in porcine dsp, we first targeted the small glycosylated dsp cleavage products  from the n-terminal region of dsp. as none of the dentin extracts are perfectly homogeneous with respect to their contents, we refer to each extract that we characterized using a notation that reflects the extraction and fractionation steps that produced it . routine characterizations of these fractions  are provided in additional files online.

demineralized dentin powder was subjected to a series of extraction procedures. a flow chart of the extractions is provided in figure  <dig>  simple analyses of the extracts  are shown in additional file  <dig>  intact dsp proteoglycan and its cleavage products containing gag attachments segregated in the acid/nacl or "an" extract, which was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. dsp degradation products containing the gag attachments displayed a stains-all positive smear migrating between 50- to 100-kda on sds-page, which were collected in the third  of five rp-hplc fractions . ans1/2-r <dig> was resolved into two final fractions by repeating the rp-hplc run. these two fractions  were digested with chondroitinase abc to degrade their gag attachments, which converted the proteoglycan smears on sds-page into small peptides  that contained no disulfide bridges, as their mobilities were not affected by the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol . chondroitinase abc digestion converted ans1/2-r3a into four peptides and ans1/2-r3b into two peptides having apparent molecular weights ranging from 8- to 25-kda . these six peptides were excised and eluted from the gel  and then characterized by n-terminal sequencing and by amino acid analysis . the n-terminal sequence and amino acid compositions allowed the complete amino acid sequences of the six peptides to be deduced .

peptides  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained the putative gag attachment site at ser <dig> and the amino acid compositions for each of these proteins showed one fewer serine than expected. n-terminal sequence for peptide  <dig> gave a blank cylce for ser <dig>  the other n-terminal sequences did not reach ser <dig>  but the full-length of each peptide could be inferred from its amino acid composition. a blank cycle strongly suggests the presence of a posttranslational modification, but additional evidence is generally required to support this conclusion. in addition, the four peptides containing ser <dig> were only  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids in length, but migrated at 15-, 17-, 19- and 20-kda on sds-page, suggesting they retained variable lengths of gag attachment following the chondroitinase abc digestion. from these data we can safely conclude that ser <dig> is a gag attachment site; however, no information from this experiment was gained on the other putative gag attachment sites on porcine dsp   <cit> . no conclusions could be made from the analyses of peptides  <dig> and  <dig>  a blank cycle was observed at thr <dig>  but the amino acid composition suggested that this position was a threonine, and therefore not necessarily modified.

to gain additional information on posttranslational modifications in the gag attachment region of dsp, fraction ans1/2-r <dig> was digested with pronase. larger digestion products from the pronase digestion were recovered by size exclusion chromatography in the first eluted fraction  . ans1/2r3-pr <dig> resolved into  <dig> fractions by rp-hplc and each was assayed for the presence of glycosylations using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay. glycosylated peptides were detected in eight of the rp-hplc fractions: ans1/2r3pr1-d, -e, -h through -l, and -p . to identify peptides with gag attachments, the eight glycosylated fractions were digested with chondroitinase abc. the peptides were separated from the digested carbohydrate by ethanol precipitation and each supernatant  was analyzed by phenol sulfuric acid assay. fractions positive for glycan attachments  were rechromatographed using the same c- <dig> column that was used prior to the chondroitinase abc digestion. rechromatographed fractions showing a shift in their retention times relative to same sample prior to chondroitinase abc digestion were characterized by n-terminal sequencing . one peptide  gave a blank cycle for ser <dig>  while three peptides  gave blank cycles for ser <dig>  these data demonstrate that ser <dig> and ser <dig> are the gag attachment sites for porcine dsp. the n-terminal sequences of the peptides in fractions ans1/2r3pr1-k and ans1/2r3pr1-l, which were negative for gag chains based upon the phenol sulfuric acid assay, were 211eetgvxsggsga and 311tdgdnxsk, respectively. the blank cycles for thr <dig> and thr <dig> suggest these residues are modified, but these sequences also show that ser <dig> and asn <dig>  are not modified, despite their being in appropriate contexts for gag or n-glycosylation attachments, respectively.

having established that ser <dig> and ser <dig>  but not ser <dig>  have gag attachments, we then characterized the nature of the disaccharide attachments at these two gag attachment sites. peptides ans1/2r3pr1d-d  and ans1/2r3pr1p-p <dig>  were digested by chondroitinase abc. the released carbohydrates were obtained from the supernatant following ethanol precipitation of the peptide, and were characterized by their retention times relative to those of disaccharide standards on np-hplc . this determined that both gag attachment sites contained chondroitin-6-sulfate  and chondroitin-4-sulfate , and integration of the areas under their chromatogram peaks determined that c <dig> s and c <dig> s are present in a ratio  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively.

characterization of r <dig> pronase digestion products
previously we showed that intact dsp  is in fraction ans1/2-r <dig>  <cit> . this r <dig> fraction  was digested with pronase, and glycosylated peptides were collected in the first peak by size exclusion chromatography . these peptides resolved into eight peaks by rp-hplc . n-terminal sequencing of these peptides gave blank cycles for asn <dig>  asn <dig>  thr <dig>  thr <dig>  and ser <dig> 

characterization of dsp n-linked glycosylation sites
previously we showed by western blot analyses that low molecular weight  peptides from the n-terminal region of dsp can be found in the acid or "a" extract  <cit> . to identify glycosylated amino acids in these peptides, the a extract was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography followed by rp-hplc . the lmw dsp components in fraction as2r-g  were digested with endoproteinase glu-c  and the digest was fractionated by rp-hplc . fifteen peaks were observed and each of these fractions was digested with glycopeptidase a. following the n-deglycosylation, each sample was rechromatographed on the same c- <dig> column to demonstrate that deglycosylation of the glycopeptide had altered its retention time. a shift in retention time on the column following deglycosylation was accepted as evidence that the original peptide was glycosylated. fractions corresponding to the main chromatographic peaks that were not present before the glycopeptidase a digestion  were characterized by lc/msms analysis . five n-glycosylation sites were identified: asn <dig> , asn <dig> , asn <dig> , asn <dig> , asn <dig> , and asn <dig> .

analysis of sialic acid in dsp
it was known early on that dsp glycosylations are rich in sialic acid, which was the basis for its designation as dentin sialoprotein  <cit> . sialic acid refers to n-acetylneuraminic acid  and its derivatives. to determine the amount of n-glycosylations in each dspp fraction, we released the n-glycosylation with glycopeptidase a and chemically attached a fluorescent label. one fluorescent label was added per n-glycosylation. the amount of n-glycosylation in each dsp fraction was determined by running an aliquot of labeled glycosylation over an se-hplc column and then comparing the areas under the chromatographic peaks to that of a commercial a <dig> glycan standard of known amount and fluorescence . to quantify the average number of sialic acid attachments per n-glycosylation, we digested lmw-dsp  and r5-dsp  fractions with sialidase. the released sialic acid was digested with aldolase and the product  and lactic dehydrogenase were used to oxidize β-nadh to β-nad, which was measured spectrophotometrically. the same series of reactions were conducted on a commercial standard . the results showed that there were, on average,  <dig>  sialic acids per n-glycosylation in the n-terminal region of dsp, and about  <dig>  molecules of sialic acid, on average, per n-glycosylation in dspp .

to identify which forms of sialic acid were present on the n-linked glycosylations, n-glycosylations were released from the various dsp fractions , given a fluorescent label, and purified by size exclusion chromatography. sialic acid was released from these glycosylations by sialidase digestion, labeled, and then passed through a rp-hplc column. by comparing the retention times of the labeled sialic acid from the dsp fractions to a similarly-labeled sialic acid reference panel it was demonstrated that all of the sialic acid attached to dsp n-glycosylations are n-acetylneuraminic acid , which is the predominant form of sialic acid in mammalian cells .

discussion
in this study we identified six n-linked and three tentative o-linked glycosylation and the two gag attachment sites on porcine dsp . the two gag attachment sites are particularly interesting. xylosyltransferase i  and xylosyltransferase ii  catalyze the initial step in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and determine if a site will have a gag attachment  <cit> . experimentally determined gag attachment sites identify the range of amino acid contexts that are recognized by these enzymes and provide the data needed to improve the prediction algorythms for gag attachment sites.

the two gag attachment sites are in the most highly conserved area of dsp . the context for the second site  contains a gsg-motif combined with a high number of surrounding acidic amino acids, so this sequence would be predicted to be a good acceptor for a xylosylation reaction and result in a high degree of xylosylation catalyzed by both xt-isoforms  <cit> .

the first site  has two acidic amino acids on the n-terminal side and a series of acidic amino acids starting at positions + <dig> or + <dig>  which are positive features. however, the proline in the - <dig> position is thought to have an inhibitory effect on the glycosylation reaction  <cit> . despite this, our results indicate that ser <dig> is a gag attachment site. perhaps the high conservation of the surrounding amino acids helps ensure its recognition as a target for glycosylation. recently, it was shown that altering the potential gag attachment sites sequences in rat dsp diminished the apparent size of the recombinant protein on western blots, indicating that both of the gag attachments sites identified in this study have gag attachments in rat dsp  <cit> .

it is clear from our analyses that the repeating disaccharide units attached to ser <dig> and ser <dig> are chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate, with c <dig> s predominating. based upon antibody analyses, we previously detected only c <dig> s attached to porcine dsp  <cit> . dentin matrix protein  <dig>  is a bone and dentin proteoglycan that plays a role in phosphate homeostasis  <cit> . in rat, the predominant disaccharide unit on dsp and dmp <dig> is c <dig> s  <cit> .

the role of dsp gag chains in dentin formation is largely unexplored. proteoglycans such as decorin are known to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis  <cit> . gags are thought to interact directly with dentin collagen fibrils, as an electrondense substance that can be removed from dentin collagen fibrils by chondroitinase treatment  <cit> . dsp is the most abundant proteoglycan in dentin and is therefore likely to interact with collagen. chondroitinase activity in the dentin matrix might regulate interactions between the dsp gag chains and collagen.

besides having two gag attachments, porcine dsp has at least six n-glycosylations. all of these sites are on the n-terminal side of the lone cysteine  that covalently links two dsp proteins into a dimer. although a high degree of n-glycosylation is a characteristic feature of dsp, the individual glycosylation sites are not well conserved. the n-linked glycosylations on porcine dsp average about one sialic acid per n-glycosylation. previously it was shown that rat dsp contained  <dig> % carbohydrate including about 9% sialic acid  <cit> . sialic acid attachments can serve a wide range of functions  <cit> . sialic acid moities can be ligands for other molecules, such as lectins. perhaps dsp could form a bridge between molecules that interact with sialic acid and others that interact with o-glycosylations or gag attachments.

the two o-glycosylations and two gag attachments are all on the c-terminal side of cys <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and thr <dig> are perfectly conserved, whereas thr <dig> is conserved in all known dsp sequences except the mouse. thus the o-glycosylations and glycosaminoglycan attachments are structural elements that are likely to be essential for dsp function. three predicted golgi casein kinase phosphorylation sites  are all found in the c-terminal side of dsp and are perfectly conserved.

the map of porcine dsp posttranslational modifications suggests that dsp is divided into two domains that are separated by the lone cysteine  that covalently links two dsp proteins. the n-terminal side is rich in sialidated n-glycosylations; the c-terminal side contains the gags, o-glycosylations, and phosphorylated serines.

the dsp domain of dspp is not highly phosphorylated . in contrast, the small dgp domain has four perfectly conserved sites, while dpp has well over a hundred. the dsp domain is not highly conserved. only  <dig> of  <dig>  if its amino acids are perfectly conserved among the seven mammalian dsp sequences in genbank, whereas 28/ <dig>  of dgp is perfectly conserved. the most highly conserved regions of dsp and dgp are in areas of posttranslational modifications, highlighting their importance for function. dsp is important for the onset of dentin mineralization, and future studies will investigate the importance ptms in carrying out these functions.

CONCLUSIONS
dentin sialoprotein , the n-terminal domain of dentin sialophosphoprotein  was isolated from developing porcine molars and its posttranslational modification were characterized. porcine dsp has at least  <dig> n-linked glycosylations  that average one sialic acid each, all in the form of n-acetylneuraminic acid. porcine dsp has exactly two glycosaminoglycan attachments  that are comprised of chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a ratio of  <dig> to  <dig>  three o-linked glycosylations in dsp were tentatively assigned . glycosylations divide porcine dsp into a heavily n-glycosylated, sialidated n-terminal domain and a c-terminal domain with two gag attachments, three o-glycosylations, and three potential phosphoserines. the two dsp domains are separated by the lone cysteine  that connects two dsp chains into a covalent dimer. knowledge of dsp structure is an important starting point to understanding the how dsp serves to initiate mineralization of dentin.
