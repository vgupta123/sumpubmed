BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis has an expanded genetic repertoire in several metabolic pathways, including those involved in energy metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis and dna repair, a feature that is predicted to contribute to the enhanced metabolic responsiveness of this organism under stressful environmental conditions  <cit> . this capacity is illustrated by the first two steps of the pathway for the biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor , which is synthesized through a multi-step pathway that requires the input of several proteins at each step  <cit> . genes involved in moco biosynthesis and those encoding molybdoenzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of m. tuberculosis . molybdoenzymes facilitate redox reactions in carbon, nitrogen and sulphur metabolism in a diversity of eukaryotes and archea  <cit> . these findings, together with the proposed importance of this cofactor for pathogenesis, suggest that moco biosynthesis is a potentially interesting pathway for further understanding the lifestyle of the tubercle bacillus during infection.

molybdopterin  is formed in the second step of the pathway via a reaction which is catalyzed by the heterotetrameric mpt synthase, an enzyme comprising a pair of associated moad-moae heterodimers  <cit>  . the two sulphur molecules which are transferred to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate  are carried on the c-terminal glycine of moad as a thiocarboxylate. in order for the synthase to remain catalytically active, the sulfur on the c-terminus of moad must be regenerated in a series of steps   <cit> . moeb is responsible for the atp-dependent activation of the c-terminus of moad to form moad-adenylate  <cit> , a reaction which requires the dissociation of moad from moae and formation of a moeb-moad complex  <cit> . studies in escherichia coli have shown that the adenylated moad is then sulfurated by the cysteine desulphurase, iscs  <cit> , an enzyme which acts as a sulfur donor in various reactions, including those required for the biosynthesis of biotin, thiamin and lipoic acid  <cit> . it was recently demonstrated that a rhodanese-like protein, ynje, is required to direct iscs to moco biosynthesis in e. coli  <cit> . the formation of mpt proceeds via an intermediate carrying a single sulphur molecule and a terminal phosphate group, which remains tightly bound to the moae dimer. the conversion of the intermediate to mpt requires the dissociation of the uncharged moad and binding of a second thiocarboxylated moad  <cit> .figure  <dig>

in m. tuberculosis, the genes encoding mpt synthase subunits include moad <dig>  moad <dig>  moae <dig>  moae <dig>  and moax, where the latter encodes a fused molybdopterin synthase with moad- and moae-like domains located on a single polypeptide  <cit>  . in previous work, we demonstrated that mtb moad <dig>  mtb moad <dig> and moax all contribute to molybdopterin biosynthesis in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the presence of moax in the genus mycobacterium is restricted to those pathogenic mycobacteria that comprise the m. tuberculosis complex  <cit> . the demonstrated functionality of this atypical mpt-synthase-encoding gene suggests that it may serve a specific cellular function in pathogenesis  <cit> . however, the prevailing biochemical evidence pertaining to the catalytic mechanism of mpt synthase in e. coli  <cit>  suggests that moax is likely to be non-functional as a single polypeptide for the following reasons:  in its active form, moad is thiocarboxylated at a c-terminal glycine  residue  <cit> .  during the formation of mpt, the sulfur atom on the c-terminus of moad is transferred to cpmp, bound in the substrate pocket of moae, which can accommodate both the c-terminus of moad as well as mpt or cpmp  <cit> ; in this context, it is unlikely that the fused moax would accommodate this catalytic process.  moad, like ubiquitin, contains a c-terminal gly-gly motif which has been shown to be important for the function and stability of mpt synthase  <cit> , and deletion, insertion or substitution mutants of these revealed that the terminal gly residue  and the penultimate gly  are essential for mpt synthase activity.  substitution of either gly residue did not affect the ability to form a moad-moae heterodimer complex, although the g81a substitution in e. coli slowed complex formation by 60%, thus identifying this residue as essential for optimal mpt synthase function  <cit> . in moax, the corresponding gly81-gly <dig> residues are not located at the c-terminus but rather reside within the polypeptide chain , thus suggesting that cleavage of moax into its moad and moae components is required in order to liberate the terminal glycine residues to mediate the above-mentioned functions.

m. tuberculosis contains two rhodanese-like proteins, moebr and moezr , which are predicted to be involved in moco biosynthesis; both of these proteins are able to catalyze the sulphuration of moad <dig> and moad <dig>  <cit> . in prior work, we demonstrated that moad <dig> from m. tuberculosis was not functional in m. smegmatis  <cit> , a finding which we ascribed to the lack of the corresponding rhodanese-like protein in m. smegmatis. in the present study, we investigate whether cleavage of moax is necessary for functionality of the resulting subunits. we also assess whether the presence of the rhodanese-like protein, moebr, is necessary for the function of m. tuberculosis moad homologues in m. smegmatis.

RESULTS
functional analysis of mpt synthase encoding genes from m. tuberculosis
the proteomes of m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis are predicted to contain  <dig> and  <dig> molybdoenzymes respectively; included among these are respiratory and/or assimilatory nitrate reductase  enzymes  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, the membrane-bound nr, narghi, is the only nr present and it serves both respiratory and assimilatory functions  <cit> . in addition to narghi, m. smegmatis possesses an additional narb-encoded assimilatory nr, which is also predicted to be a molybdoenzyme  <cit> . in prior work, we developed an assay for moco availability in m. smegmatis which is based on measuring growth on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source via moco-dependent nr activity. we used this assay to confirm the essentiality of the sole mpt synthase subunit-encoding genes in this organism, designated herein as msm moad <dig> and msm moae <dig>  <cit>  , for moco biosynthesis. this growth-based assay thus provided a convenient means of evaluating the ability of various combinations of m. tuberculosis moad and moae genes to encode functional mpt synthase activity. we first tested if a double mutant of m. smegmatis lacking msm moad <dig> and msm moae <dig>  carrying combinations of the mtb moad <dig>  mtb moad <dig>  mtb moae <dig>  or mtb moae <dig> genes, on vectors that integrated into the mycobacterial chromosome , displayed detectable nr activity. none of the combinations of m. tuberculosis genes tested was able to restore nr-dependent growth of the m. smegmatis Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant when provided in single copy via an integration vector . to test whether the lack of functional complementation was attributable to a low level of gene expression, we used qrt-pcr to assess gene expression levels in the various m. smegmatis recombinants. however, this analysis confirmed that in all cases, the m. tuberculosis genes were expressed at levels higher than the native msm moad <dig> and msm moae <dig> genes in wild type m. smegmatis .table  <dig>

analysis of gene expression and moco biosynthesis in genetically complemented strains.  comparison of heterologous gene expression levels from integrating  versus episomal  complementing vectors. the expression level of each gene was normalized against the expression of the siga gene. in all cases, the data shown are representative of three independent biological replicates with standard errors of the mean. the expression of moad <dig> and moae <dig> in wild type  m. smegmatis and the expression of moax, when provided in single copy  or multicopy  was also assessed for comparison.  nitrate assimilation in strains complemented with episomal vectors carrying different combinations of mpt-synthase-encoding genes. strains were grown in mpln medium supplemented with 10 mm nitrate as the sole nitrate source.



in prior work, we had demonstrated the functionality of mtb moad <dig>  mtb moae <dig> and mtb moae <dig> through complementation of m. smegmatis mutants lacking either msm moad <dig> or msm moae <dig> by delivering the m. tuberculosis genes on an episomal plasmid  <cit> , as opposed to an integrative vector. we therefore constructed synthetic operons carrying pairs of m. tuberculosis moad and moae homologs under the control of the mycobacterial hsp <dig> promoter  and cloned these on an episomal plasmid. the resulting constructs were introduced into m. smegmatis Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> and the resulting strains assessed for moco-dependent growth on nitrate as sole nitrogen source. as observed by williams et al.  <cit> , episomally expressed moax was able to restore moco biosynthesis in the Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant . however, of the various combinations of m. tuberculosis genes tested, only the combination of mtb moad <dig> and mtb moae <dig> reconstituted moco biosynthesis, as evidenced by growth restoration of the double mutant . in contrast, none of the synthetic operon constructs carrying mtb moad <dig> proved to be functional  despite achieving gene expression levels comparable to, or higher than, the native msm moad <dig> or msm moae <dig> genes in wild type m. smegmatis .

the lack of functionality of the m. tuberculosis mtb moad2-mtb moae <dig> combination, when expressed episomally as a synthetic operon was surprising since these genes had been shown to individually complement single deletion mutants of m. smegmatis lacking either msm moad <dig> or msm moae <dig>  <cit> . we reasoned that this discrepancy might be due to differences in maturation of the mpt synthase or in sulphur metabolism between these organisms. furthermore, the lack of functionality of mtb moad <dig> in m. smegmatis was previously ascribed to the absence of moebr in this organism which is proposed to preferentially interact with moad <dig> in m. tuberculosis since some mycobacterial strains have moezr and moad <dig> only, with no moad <dig> and moebr homologues  <cit> . in order to further assess the preferential requirement of moebr to activate mtb moad <dig>  moebr from m. tuberculosis was expressed on an operon with mtb moad <dig> and mtb moae <dig> and delivered into the m. smegmatis Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant on an episomal vector. expression analysis of the recombinant strain identified moebr transcript at a level equivalent to that of mtb moad <dig> . however, this strain was unable to grow on nitrate in minimal medium .

moax is cleaved to yield two functional mpt synthase subunits
the active site of the mpt synthase is located within a pocket of moae and contains conserved c-terminal gly residues of moad which are directly involved in enzyme activity  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that moax might be post-translationally processed into moad and moae components in order to provide access to the residues gly <dig> and gly <dig> in the moad component of moax for further chemical modification. to test this, we first created a derivative of moax carrying a c-terminal flag-tag, termed moaxfl. the moaxfl derivative was fully proficient at restoring moco biosynthesis in the m. smegmatis Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant, confirming that the flag-tag did not disrupt mpt synthase activity . western blot analysis of a cell extract from this strain, probing with an antibody directed to the flag-tag, revealed the presence of two major bands, which corresponded to the predicted sizes for full-length moaxfl  and the flag-tagged moae domain of moax , respectively . peptide mass fingerprinting confirmed the presence of moae peptides in the  <dig>  kda band, with the terminal residue of one of the peptides corresponding to the gly <dig> residue in moad . no peptides that spanned the moad-moae junction were identified. these data confirmed cleavage at the gly <dig> motif in moax to yield canonical moad and moae subunits. the presence of residual full length moax suggested that moax processing might be condition dependent. to further investigate this, we tested the extent of moax cleavage under different growth conditions, which included 7h <dig> broth or mpln media. however, we found no difference in the extent of cleavage under these conditions .figure  <dig>

the gly81-gly <dig> motif in moax is necessary for cleavage and function
as outlined above, the two terminal gly residues in moad have been identified as important for mpt synthase activity in e. coli  <cit> . sequence alignment of moax with mtb moad <dig> and mtb moad <dig> as well as with e. coli moad reveals that these gly residues, gly <dig> and gly <dig> , are conserved in moax . in order to assess whether these residues are important for moax function and/or cleavage, site-directed mutagenesis of the moaxfl gene was carried out to individually replace each gly with an ala. moco biosynthesis was then assessed in strains carrying the corresponding mutant moaxflg81a or moaxflg82a alleles. unlike wild type moaxfl, the mutant derivatives, moaxflg81a and moaxflg82a, were unable to restore moco biosynthesis in the mpt-synthase deficient mutant of m. smegmatis . in addition to being essential for functionality, western blot analysis revealed that gly <dig> is also required for cleavage of moax since no discernible cleavage was detected for the moaxflg81a mutant protein . in contrast, while essential for function, gly <dig> did not appear to be required for moax processing as evidenced by the presence of a  <dig>  kda moae band in the western blot analysis of the strain expressing moaxflg82a .figure  <dig> 
cleavage of moax is necessary for function.  nitrate assimilation in strains carrying flag-tagged mutated derivatives of moax. shown are strains carrying either a g81a or g82a mutation.  western blot analysis. an antibody directed at the flag-tag was used  nitrate assimilation in the Δmoae <dig> single mutant of m. smegmatis. growth curves were performed in mpln medium with cell density measured over a period of 5 days. the g81a mutation abolished cleavage, whereas mutation g82a did not interfere with processing, but yielded a non-functional moad subunit. all data represent the result of three independent experiments.



the mutated gly81/gly <dig> residues form part of the moad component of moax, suggesting that once cleaved, the moae component of the enzyme would remain active. in order to test this, the vectors expressing moaxflg81a or moaxflg82a were introduced into the m. smegmatis Δmoae <dig> single mutant and the recombinant strains assessed for growth on nitrate as sole nitrogen source. moco biosynthesis was restored in the strain expressing moaxg82a , which confirmed that the mtb moae subunit released through cleavage of moax can associate with msm moad <dig> to reconstitute a functional, chimeric mpt synthase. in contrast, the Δmoae <dig> strain expressing the non-functional, un-cleavable moaxflg81a was severely attenuated for growth on nitrate as sole nitrogen source , providing further evidence that moax cleavage is indeed required for the function of the resulting moae subunit.

finally, a recent study revealed that m. tuberculosis moax was unable to complement e. coli moad or moae single mutants  <cit> . the authors of this study hypothesized that this was due to the lack of moax cleavage machinery in e. coli. we addressed this question by western blot analysis of protein extracts from e. coli cells expressing moaxfl. full-length moaxfl as well as a minor band of higher molecular weight than expected for the moae subunit were observed in the western blot. however, in contrast to the m. smegmatis control, a band corresponding to the flag-tagged moae component of moax was not observed in the e. coli extract .figure  <dig>

discussion
m. tuberculosis has a multiplicity of mpt-synthase-encoding genes which all contribute to moco biosynthesis  <cit> . the observation that chimeras of mpt synthase from different combinations of human and e. coli subunits display varying catalytic efficiencies  <cit> , together with the demonstrated functionality of the mtb moad <dig>  mtb moad <dig>  mtb moae <dig>  and mtb moae <dig> genes  <cit> , raised the possibility that different isoforms of mpt synthase might occur in m. tuberculosis. however, only a combination of mtb moad <dig> and mtb moae <dig>  when expressed at high levels from an episomal plasmid in m. smegmatis, was able to complement the conditional growth phenotype of the Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant; none of the other combinations of mtb moad and moae homologues that were tested formed a functional mpt synthase. the expression levels of complementing genes in strains carrying mtb moae <dig>  either on integrative or episomal vectors, were all relatively low when compared to those carrying mtb moae <dig>  suggesting that an expression threshold may be required in order to achieve functional complementation in the heterologous host. importantly, however, moax complemented the growth phenotype of the double mutant when expressed from an integrative vector at a comparably low level, suggesting that a factor/s other than expression level was responsible for the differential complementing abilities of the mtb moad/moae combinations.

in e. coli, moeb adenylates moad which is subsequently sulfurated by iscs and a rhodanese-like protein, ynje, to generate the thiocarboxylated form of moad required for mpt formation  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, both moebr and moezr contain a rhodanese-like domain and are capable of sulfur transfer in vitro to mtb moad <dig> and mtb moad <dig>  <cit> . however, the amino acid sequence of mtb moad <dig> is more closely related to the sulphur carrier protein, cyso, than to mtb moad <dig>  this observation, together with the fact that cyso is a preferential substrate for moezr, has led to the hypothesis that mtb moad <dig> is preferentially activated by moebr, while mtb moad <dig> is activated by moezr  <cit> . this is supported by the fact that other mycobacteria, including mycobacterium avium  <dig>  mycobacterium marinum and mycobacterium ulcerans, contain moad <dig> and moezr, but not moad <dig> and moebr homologues  <cit> . importantly, both mtb moad <dig> and moebr are located on a mobile genetic cluster that was acquired by horizontal gene transfer  <cit>  thus further supporting the notion that moebr preferentially activates mtb moad <dig>  m. smegmatis possesses a single moad gene  and moezr suggesting that the lack of functionality of mtb moad <dig> in this organism could be attributable to differences in the complement of enzymes with a rhodanese-like domain. however, inclusion of moebr in an expression cassette carrying mtb moad <dig> and mtb moae <dig> did not result in functional complementation of the moco biosynthesis defect of the Δmoad <dig> Δmoae <dig> mutant. this suggests that the lack of functionality for mtb moad <dig> may be due to other reasons such as differences in the complement sulphur carrier proteins, and/or in cysteine biosynthesis.

in e. coli, cyso is involved in cysteine biosynthesis  <cit> , which highlights a role for moezr in both amino acid and moco biosynthesis, thus linking these metabolic pathways. cysteine has been implicated in m. tuberculosis pathogenesis by providing protection against reactive oxygen/nitrogen intermediates  <cit> ; this also suggests a role for moezr under these conditions, which is supported by the up-regulation of cysm, cyso and moezr in m. tuberculosis under oxidative stress  <cit> . the mycobacterial sulfur source for moco biosynthesis remains unknown but is most likely l-cysteine  <cit> , in which case, an l-cysteine desulphurase such as iscs would transfer sulfur to moezr. in e. coli, iscs is implicated in iron-sulfur cluster homeostasis  <cit>  and may have a similar role in mycobacteria which, through an interaction with moezr, would link iron-sulfur cluster homeostasis with the second step of moco biosynthesis. it is therefore reasonable to conclude that disruptions in the mpt synthase step of the pathway would not only affect moco biosynthesis but might also disturb cysteine biosynthesis and sulfur homeostasis. consistent with this is the large number of transposon mutants of m. tuberculosis which map to the first two steps of the moco biosynthesis pathway and are defective for intracellular growth or survival in animals  <cit> .

structural analysis of the e. coli mpt synthase revealed that the essential terminal gly residue of moad is embedded in a pocket of moae where the sulphur transfer reaction occurs  <cit> . considering this domain organization and catalysis sequence, it was unclear how the single polypeptide, encoded by moax would be able to function. in this study, we demonstrated cleavage of moax and further studied the role of the gly81-gly <dig> residues; a model that describes our findings is shown in figure  <dig>  the gly <dig> residue is required for proteolytic processing and the inability of the moaxflg81a mutant protein to restore moco biosynthesis confirmed that cleavage of moax is necessary for catalysis. this is corroborated by the ability of the non-functional but cleaved moaxflg82a mutant protein to restore mpt synthase activity in the Δmoae <dig> mutant, which retains a functional msm moad <dig>  in this case, moco biosynthesis is restored through the activity of a chimeric msm moad2- mtb moae enzyme, confirming that cleavage of moax releases functionally interchangeable subunits. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that mutation of the gly <dig> residue in the un-cleaved protein may also contribute to lack of function. the identification of residual full-length moax for all cases in which cleavage was observed suggests that in m. smegmatis, the cleavage process is either slow or subject to regulation.figure  <dig> 
the role of the gly81-gly <dig> residues in moax. the gly <dig> and gly <dig> residues in moax are required for functionality. mass spectrometry analysis of moax cleavage products confirmed that proteolytic processing occurs between the gly82-ser <dig> motifs to yield two functional mpt-synthase subunits. mutation of gly <dig> abrogates processing, yielding a non-functional, uncleaved derivative of moax suggesting that this residue is important for recognition/binding of the protease. in contrast, the g82→a mutation does not affect cleavage but the resulting moad-like subunit is not functional due to the absence of the terminal glycine, which is required for activation of moad by moeb. however, the moae subunit that results from cleavage of this mutant protein can combine with the msm moad <dig> to reconstitute a functional enzyme.



finally, a recent study by voss et al.  <cit> , established that moax was not functional in e. coli and was unable to interact with either moebr or moezr from m. tuberculosis. the authors speculated that this was due to the lack of the moax cleavage machinery in e. coli as opposed to an inherent inability of these proteins to interact. in this study, we demonstrated that some cleavage of moax does occur when constitutively expressed in e. coli dh5α; however, the cleavage product was larger than expected, which might explain the inability of moax to function in e. coli.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that there is a degree of functional interchangeability between the mpt synthase subunits of m. tuberculosis. in the case of moax, post-translational cleavage at the gly <dig> residue is required for functionality of this novel mpt synthase.
