BACKGROUND
by screening for mutations that affect daily sleep amount in fruit flies we have recently demonstrated that the drosophila gene shaker plays a major role in controlling sleep amount  <cit> . flies carrying the null allele minisleep , or several other null alleles of shaker, sleep only 3– <dig> h/day, while their wild-type controls sleep 8– <dig> h/day  <cit> . similar to their controls, however, shaker mutant flies mostly sleep at night, even when kept in constant darkness, and show a sleep rebound after sleep deprivation, suggesting that they have a normal circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep  <cit> . the shaker locus encodes the alpha  subunit of a tetrameric potassium channel that passes a voltage-activated fast-inactivating current, ia. in drosophila, ia plays a major role in the control of membrane repolarization and transmitter release  <cit> . hyperkinetic codes for the beta  subunit of the shaker channel, which positively modulates ia  <cit> . recently, we found that hyperkinetic loss of function mutations also result in reduced sleep  <cit> . thus, in drosophila, two different genes affecting the shaker-related current have a strong effect on sleep.

while there is only one shaker gene in drosophila, at least  <dig> genes coding for alpha subunits of voltage-dependent potassium channels are present in mammals  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, the closest mammalian homologues of the drosophila shaker are the alpha subunits of the kv <dig> family, while the kv <dig>  kv <dig>  and kv <dig> families are more distantly related . kv <dig> channels activate in the subthreshold voltage range in many cell types, and can act as extremely diverse regulators of neuronal excitability. in the supragranular layers of the rat cerebral cortex, for instance, most pyramidal cells contain different combinations of kv <dig> , kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>  subunits, localized in both the somatodendritic and the axonal compartments  <cit> . most kv <dig> subunits produce a slowly-inactivating current, originally defined as "d current" in the hippocampus  <cit> . however, depending on the subunit composition, the presence of beta  subunits, and their anatomical position, the exact biophysical properties and functional properties of the kv1-mediated currents can vary  <cit> .

it is presently unclear whether potassium channels containing any of the eight members of the kv <dig> family of alpha subunits can affect mammalian sleep as powerfully as shaker affects drosophila sleep. here, we studied the potential role of kv <dig>  by measuring sleep and the response to sleep deprivation in mice carrying a null mutation of kcna <dig>  the murine gene coding for kv <dig> . we focused on this subunit because it is, together with kv <dig>  and kv <dig> , the most highly expressed in the rodent brain. specifically, kv <dig>  is prominently and homogenously expressed in the rat thalamocortical system  <cit> , which is important for the generation of sleep rhythms  <cit> . moreover, its expression is modulated by synaptic activity  <cit> .

some of these findings have previously been presented in abstract form  <cit> .

RESULTS
we found that knockout  pups appeared healthy and grew normally during the first  <dig> weeks of life. at p <dig>  however, ko pups were smaller than their littermates , p =  <dig> ; -11% vs heterozygous , p =  <dig> ). ko pups also did not show clear differences from their littermates in their ability to recover from surgery and anesthesia. specifically, the required dose of anesthetic and wake-up time  were similar in all pups. similarly, post-operative general appearance and changes in weight did not differ among pups. previous observations had indicated that all ko pups die by p <dig>  with an average lifespan of  <dig> days  <cit> . by using continuous electroencephalograph  and video recordings from p <dig> to p <dig> we confirmed the conclusion by brew et al, which was based on behavioral observation, that the cause of death was an isolated episode of generalized seizure  <cit> . seizures were never seen, either at the behavioral or the eeg level, in hz mice, and occurred rarely in ko pups before the terminal episode. specifically, at p <dig>  the day that was used for the sleep analysis described below, four ko pups did not have seizures, while the other three pups had an average of  <dig>  seizures , accounting for  <dig> %  of the their total recording time . most seizures we recorded between p <dig> and p <dig> occurred during waking  or during rapid eye movement  sleep , as shown in figure  <dig>  obvious seizure behavior was always associated with an ictal eeg pattern, and abnormal spiking eeg activity was only recorded in ko pups during overt generalized seizure behavior, which is described in detail in another study  <cit> . one of the seven ko pups died following its first recorded seizure, one after its second seizure, and one after its third seizure. in one ko pup that was eeg recorded through p <dig> we did not detect any seizure. sixteen other ko pups were implanted at p <dig> but died of seizures before we could collect  <dig> h of eeg recording. based on direct visual observation and by reviewing the 24-h video recordings, we could not identify clear signs of behavioral hyperactivity in ko pups. in fact, until the occurrence of the first seizure, ko pups could not be distinguished from their littermates based on their general behavior and locomotor activity levels. moreover, the 24-h integrated electromyogram  activity during waking, expressed as a percentage of the 24-h integrated emg activity during non-rapid eye movement  sleep, was similar in ko pups relative to their hz and wt siblings .

as shown in figure  <dig>  at p <dig> all pups showed consolidated periods of sleep and waking, a clear diurnal rhythmicity , and robust entrainment to the light-dark cycle. ko pups, however, spent significantly less time in nrem sleep  and significantly more time in waking  than wt pups, with a 10%  decrease in rem sleep time. the differences between ko and wt mice were significant also when the time spent in waking and nrem sleep was computed separately for the light and the dark phase . during the light period, ko pups also spent more time in waking  than hz pups, while waking, nrem, and rem sleep amounts in hz pups did not differ from those in wt pups. the increase in waking time in ko pups was mainly due to an increase in the number of waking episodes, while their duration, as well as the number of brief awakenings, did not differ among genotypes . nrem sleep episodes did not differ in their number across genotypes, while their duration showed a tendency toward a decrease in ko pups . subtle differences were present among genotypes in the eeg power spectrum during nrem and rem sleep. during nrem sleep, ko mice showed a higher eeg power in the low-frequency range , and a lower eeg power in the  <dig> – <dig> hz frequency range relative to both hz and wt pups . two ko pups were also recorded at p <dig>  and the results were similar to those seen at p <dig>  specifically, in these two animals, waking time/ <dig> h increased by 19% and 15% relative to wt and hz littermates, respectively, while nrem sleep/ <dig> h decreased by 30% and 28% .

adult  hz and wt mice did not differ in the amount of time spent in waking, nrem, and rem sleep , nor in any other sleep parameter examined, including the number and duration of waking episodes, the number and duration of nrem episodes, and the number of brief awakenings . the eeg power spectrum in waking, nrem and rem sleep during baseline was also similar in the two groups . during the first  <dig> h of recovery sleep following sleep deprivation, both hz and wt mice spent more time in nrem sleep than during baseline, although the increase reached significance only in the wt group . when expressed as percentage increase in nrem sleep time across the first  <dig> h of recovery sleep, this sleep rebound did not differ between hz and wt mice . the total amount of nrem sleep recovered during the first  <dig> h after sleep deprivation was also similar in hz and wt mice . finally, during the first  <dig> h of recovery slow wave activity  during nrem sleep increased significantly, relative to baseline, in both hz and wt mice . the overall swa time course did not differ between the two groups before or after sleep deprivation .

discussion
in this study we confirmed that kcna <dig> null mice, in which the expression of the voltage-dependent potassium channel alpha subunit kv <dig>  is completely abolished, die within the first 3– <dig> weeks because of an episode of generalized seizures  <cit> . seizures and a reduced lifespan have also been described in kcna <dig> null mice, in which the expression of the kv <dig>  subunit is abolished  <cit> , as well as in kcnab <dig> null mice  <cit> , lacking the modulatory subunit beta  <dig>  which co-distributes extensively with kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  in the adult rat brain  <cit> . about 50% of kcna <dig> null mice die suddenly between the third and the fifth week of life, in many cases after an episode of generalized seizure, and the mice that survive to adulthood display frequent  spontaneous seizures throughout adult life  <cit> . the seizure behavior in the kcna <dig> mice examined in this study appears even more severe than in kcna <dig> null mice, because none of our ko pups survived to adulthood. thus, if seizure susceptibility provides any indication of the role of different kv <dig> subunits in the control of neuronal excitability, kv <dig>  appears to have a very important one. so far, neuronal excitability in kcna <dig> null mice has been directly measured only in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, where it is decreased  <cit> . thus, the brain regions responsible for the increased seizure susceptibility of kcna <dig> null mice remain to be identified. we recently performed microinjections of an antibody against the extracellular portion of kv <dig>  in the cerebral cortex of adult rats. this antibody has been previously shown in vitro to block the kv <dig> -mediated current by up to 70%  <cit> . we found that while low doses were able to block eeg signs of slow wave sleep, high doses also produced seizures  <cit> , suggesting that an increase in neuronal excitability in the cerebral cortex, due to a block of the kv <dig> -mediated current, is sufficient to trigger seizure activity.

because of the reduced lifespan of our ko mice, we were forced to analyze their sleep pattern at p <dig>  at this development stage the sleep-waking cycle shows a clear diurnal rhythm, is fully entrained to the light-dark cycle, and eeg signs of waking, nrem sleep, and rem sleep are fully developed  <cit> . moreover, at p <dig> mouse pups can be separated from their mothers and continuously recorded for several days. we found that ko pups slept significantly less than hz and wt pups, mainly because they spent less time in nrem sleep during both the light and the dark period. during our 24-h recordings seizure activity, at the behavioral and eeg level, was either completely absent , or very rare , accounting for less than 1% of the total recording time. even when present, seizures seldom originated during nrem sleep. moreover, the increase in waking time and the decrease in nrem sleep time were not more pronounced in the three ko pups that showed seizures relative to the other four . thus, the decrease in nrem sleep time in ko pups cannot be due to the repeated occurrence of seizures originating during this phase of sleep. furthermore, although we cannot completely rule out this possibility due to the low number of animals, it is unlikely that the presence of seizures at p <dig> could account for the observed changes in the sleep/waking cycle.

a role for some voltage-dependent potassium channels in the regulation of sleep has been suggested by previous studies, which focused on the kv <dig> family. mice lacking the potassium channel subunit kv. <dig> , which is expressed in fast-spiking, parvalbumin-containing interneurons in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and the thalamic reticular nucleus, show a 20–50% decrease in the eeg power in the slow wave activity  range   <cit> . however, the effect on this frequency band is seen in waking as well as in sleep, and thus its functional significance in relation to nrem sleep and its homeostatic regulation remains unclear  <cit> . mice lacking the potassium channel subunit kv. <dig> , which is expressed in thalamocortical neurons and fast spiking gabaergic interneurons of the neocortex and hippocampus, do not differ from wt controls in daily sleep amount and in their response to sleep deprivation, but show some differences in the eeg power spectrum during nrem and rem sleep  <cit> . finally, mice lacking both the kv <dig>  and the kv <dig>  subunit  show a 40% decrease in sleep amount during the light period and a 22% decrease during the dark period relative to their wt controls  <cit> . in contrast to what we found in kv <dig> -deficient pups, the decrease in sleep in these double ko mice is mainly due to a decrease in the duration of nrem episodes. moreover, kv <dig> /kv <dig>  deficient mice are hyperactive, with an increase in both ambulatory and stereotypic activity, display frequent  spontaneous myoclonic jerks, and their hyperactivity correlates, across different genotypes, with the decrease in nrem sleep  <cit> . these results suggest either that the increased motor drive in kv <dig> /kv <dig>  ko mice causes sleep loss, or that both phenotypes result from the increased neuronal excitability of a single or multiple anatomical loci  <cit> . in kv <dig> -deficient pups, instead, the decrease in nrem sleep amount was not associated with signs of sleep fragmentation, because there were no differences in the number and duration of nrem sleep episodes, or in the number of brief awakenings, between ko, hz, and wt mice. interestingly, shaker and hyperkinetic short-sleeping flies also do not show signs of sleep fragmentation  <cit> . sleep loss in kv <dig> -deficient pups was also not associated with hyperactivity, as documented by continuous video recordings and by measuring integrated emg activity. thus, the reduced amount of nrem sleep in our pups cannot be secondary to increased motor activity. moreover, the brain regions responsible for the sleep phenotype of kv <dig> -deficient mice most likely are not involved in the control of motor activity.

shaker and hyperkinetic short-sleeping flies show a normal response to sleep deprivation  <cit> , suggesting that shaker-related currents do not regulate daily sleep amount by affecting the homeostatic regulation of sleep. due to their age, we could not assess the response to sleep deprivation in kv <dig> -deficient pups. thus, we do not know whether kv <dig> -related currents also affect sleep duration without affecting sleep homeostasis. the mechanism by which shaker mutations regulate daily sleep amount in flies remains unknown, as it is the case for kcna <dig> mutations in mice. one possibility is that, by affecting an ion channel that controls membrane repolarization, shaker channels and their mammalian homologues could be close to the core cellular mechanisms of sleep. as mentioned before, in adult rats, intracortical injections of an anti-kv <dig>  antibody abolish or reduce eeg signs of nrem sleep on the injected cerebral cortex for up to  <dig> h after the injection. the effect is dose-dependent, reversible, and site-specific  <cit> . thus, the pharmacological block of the kv <dig> -mediated current seems to be sufficient in vivo to maintain a long-lasting depolarization of cortical cells incompatible with the occurrence of nrem sleep. the current study in kcna <dig> ko mice suggests, however, that such block must be almost complete for nrem sleep to be affected, because hz mice, which express approximately half of the wild-type amount of kv <dig> , slept normally. this is also true in drosophila, where only homozygous, but not heterozygous shaker mutants are short sleeping  <cit> . whether kv <dig> -mediated currents also affect human sleep is unknown. it is not known, for instance, whether human extreme short sleepers carry null or hypomorphic mutations in voltage-dependent potassium channels the same way shaker short sleeping flies do. intriguingly, however, a recent study identified auto-antibodies against members of the kv <dig> family, including kv <dig> , in the brain of a patient affected by severe insomnia associated with morvan's syndrome  <cit> . the insomnia improved after plasma exchange, suggesting that the presence of these autoantibodies was at least partially responsible for the loss of sleep.

CONCLUSIONS
kv <dig> , a mammalian homologue of shaker, regulates neuronal excitability and affects nrem sleep.
