BACKGROUND
africa is the site of the greatest human migrations  <cit>  both in terms of quantity and geographic range, but the extent of this influence is not reflected in current genetic surveys. to date, most studies of migrations within africa have focused almost exclusively on the bantu migration, by which bantu languages together with some cultural innovations were distributed throughout central, eastern and southern africa from the present cameroon-nigerian border. genetic consequences of this gene flow have been well documented in present populations  <cit> . however, the bantu language-gene spread is likely not the only dispersal to have left genetic traces in african extant populations.

another important dispersal within sub-saharan africa was the migration of chadic speaking pastoralists, which has been well studied by linguists and archaeologists but not by geneticists. chadic is one of the few well established branches of the complex afro-asiatic language phylum and is mainly spoken in west-central africa  in an area centered around lake chad . it is considered the most diversified, with ~ <dig> languages, and perhaps the most ancient subgroup within the afro-asiatic phylum  <cit> . within the afro-asiatic family, some authors relate chadic to cushitic, recognising a common cushitic-chadic node  <cit> , but this classification remains controversial.

according to linguistic analyses of afro-asiatic branches, the common ancestors of extant chadic and cushitic peoples inhabited east or northeast africa ~ <dig> – <dig>  years before present   <cit> . subsequently, probably in connection with progressive desertification of the sahara  <cit>  and increased herding of livestock, two different migrations spread out of the "cushitic-chadic motherland". the westward migration  contributed to the separation and diversification of the chadic languages in chad basin, while the southward migration  contributed to the diversification of cushitic languages in eastern africa  <cit> .

since more than  <dig>  kilometers separate the putative proto-afro-asiatic homeland in northeastern africa from lake chad and there are no chadic or cushitic speaking populations living in between these regions, some authors have proposed diverse hypotheses to explain the process by which ancient chadic speaking peoples arrived to the lake chad region. ehret  <cit>  suggested a two step migration model; proto-chadic people expanded westward to the northern half of the sahara and later migrated southward through the central sahara into the lake chad basin. the "inter-saharan hypothesis" was developed by blench  <cit> , who suggested that chadic speaking herders left their cushitic-chadic motherland in the nile valley and wandered through the large dry river system of wadi howar towards lake chad. this second hypothesis is documented linguistically by similarities of words for domesticated animals shared in cushitic and chadic and also by numerous archaeological findings. some archaeological finds are located in western sudan, such as the so-called "leiterband" pottery that shows tight connections to neolithic khartoum  <cit>  and were found at several sites along the wadi howar where the ancient pastoralists camped.

when chadic speaking herders arrived at lake chad, they were certainly not the first inhabitants of the area. from the beginning of its settlement, the greater area of the chad basin acted as a center of gravity for neighbouring populations of both niger-congo and nilo-saharan origin  <cit> . archaeological excavations around lake chad have documented several cultural changes tightly linked with oscillating climatic phases  <cit> . uninterrupted settlement is associated with the early holocene  and the establishment of the first settled communities  <cit> . the earliest evidence for settlement is in dufuna in the upper yobe valley along the komadugu guna river in northern nigeria where the oldest boat  on the african continent has been unearthed  <cit> . more information comes from konduga, also in nigeria and dated to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ybp, which has yielded neolithic artefacts such as potsherds decorated with combed incisions and polished stone industry. additional archaeological findings, such as terracotta figurines of bos sp. and bones of goats and sheep and even domesticated cattle clearly demonstrate the presence of animal husbandry  <cit> . however, there is no archaeological evidence concerning the nature of contacts between immigrating chadic speakers and the original sudanic farmers. linguistic evidence, however, suggests that both groups may have cooperated in the past, i.e. chadic loans of some basic saharo-sahelian terms  <cit> .

complete mitochondrial genome sequences are the most informative genetic data to evaluate hypotheses of past human migrations from a maternal perspective. in fact, the increased resolution of phylogenetic reconstructions and more robust estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor  enabled by whole mitochondrial genome sequences have facilitated improved models of human migrations, such as out-of-africa  <cit> , the settlement of oceania  <cit>  and the colonization of americas  <cit> .

previous research on mitochondrial diversity in the chad basin  led us to identify two potential autochthonous chad basin mitochondrial dna  haplogroups  <cit> . one was l3e <dig>  with an age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years that is concordant with a holocene expansion; this haplogroup is also seen in north african groups. the other haplogroup, tentatively named l3f <dig>  was found almost exclusively in chadic speaking groups with an estimated tmrca of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp.

the rarity of haplogroup 'l3f2' outside the chad basin was confirmed in a broad phylogeographical survey of  <dig> complete l-type genomes in africa by  <cit> . only two 'l3f2' sequences were described: one from chad and one from ethiopia. this work led also to some modifications in l3f nomenclature: the l3f <dig> in  <cit>  was changed to l3f <dig> in  <cit>  while a new subhaplogroup l3f <dig> was defined based on a polymorphisms at  <dig>  which is no longer used to define l3f, and 745it.

a unique feature of chadic speaking people is their unusually high frequency of l3f <dig> haplotypes. we identified this sub-haplogroup in  <dig> samples from  <dig> chadic speaking individuals  and in only  <dig> samples from  <dig> non-chadic speaking individuals . in this study, we perform whole genome sequence analysis of l3f <dig> haplotypes in chad basin populations in order to conduct a high-resolution characterization of the sub-haplogroup and more robust tmrca estimation of its expansion. specifically, we sequenced  <dig> different l3f haplotypes from chad basin, of which  <dig> belong to the l3f <dig> sub-haplogroup.

RESULTS
l3f phylogeny
sixteen new mtdna genomes from chad basin populations and  <dig> whole l3f genomes published elsewhere  were used to construct a phylogenetic tree  and to estimate the time to the most common ancestor  . the tree confirms the main points of behar study  <cit> , but has important additional phylogenetic features based on the chad basin sequences.

haplogroup l3f is defined by the coding variants 3396-4218-15514-15944del and the control region motif 16209– <dig> with a tmrca of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp. this haplogroup diversifies into sub-haplogroups l3f <dig>  l3f <dig> and l3f <dig>  the most geographically widespread sub-haplogroup is l3f <dig>  which is distributed across the african continent  <cit>  and also arabia  <cit>  and has a tmrca of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp. in our tree, sub-haplogroup l3f <dig> as defined by salas et al.  <cit>  using hvs-i data is now represented by two sub-haplogroups, ancestral l3f <dig> and derived l3f1b that carries two control region variants 16292– <dig>  <cit>  as well as six coding variants. the long branch leading to l3f1b may indicate constant population size and/or strong genetic drift throughout the dry climatic conditions during the last glacial period. on the other hand, the recent age for sub-haplogroup l3f1b of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp  and its star-like phylogeny suggests a population expansion in the african population bearing its ancestral motif during the climatic improvement after the last glacial maximum . subsequently, other l3f1b sub-haplogroups emerged in the holocene; l3f1b <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp, l3f1b <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp, l3f1b <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp and l3f1b <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp. the youngest clade, l3f1b <dig>  seems to be more frequent in the middle east. l3f1a seems to be older  than its sister sub-haplogroup l3f1b and is also less diversified. a few samples from chad belong to these sub-haplogroups: two to l3f1a and one to l3f1b <dig> 

sub-haplogroup l3f <dig> is only defined by the highly recurrent control region variant  <dig> and insertion 745t. however, it contains very divergent lineages resulting in a very old age for this sub-haplogroup . one l3f2b sample was observed in chad.

the clearest difference between the tree presented here and the l3f portion of the sub-saharan l-tree depicted in  <cit>  is the "chad basin" clade l3f <dig>  robusticity of this clade is unambiguously supported by  <dig> coding variants. the tmrca of this sub-haplogroup is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp, an estimate concordant with both archaeological and linguistic data. the only non-chad basin sequence in this subhaplogroup is from ethiopia, although it has a very divergent sequence suggesting it is evolutionarily distinct from the chad basin sequences; the tmrca estimate for l3f <dig> without this ethiopian sequence is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp.

in order to obtain additional information on l3f frequency distributions, we examined the current dataset of  <dig>  published african hvs-i mtdna sequences  and identified  <dig> individuals with l3f sequences for a total of  <dig> different haplotypes. we constructed a network based on these sequences  and were only able to identify sub-haplogroups l3f1b, l3f1b <dig> and l3f <dig>  because of the lower resolution of hvs-i compared to whole genome sequences. nevertheless, the higher frequency of l3f <dig> in chadic speaking individuals is confirmed and the tmrca of the l3f ancestral motif  is in good agreement with that obtained by behar et al.  <cit>   and with our dates . again, as in  <cit> , hvs-i age estimate for l3f <dig> is older  than the one obtained based on the coding-region information. however, the network based on the expanded africa dataset suggests a possible new haplotype defined by the motif 16278-16294-16301- <dig>  tentatively, this cluster can be dated to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years ago, so it chronologically corresponds with most of the holocene l3f1b clades and with the chadic l3f <dig> as well. this sub-haplogroup seems to be frequent in chadic and non-chadic speaking populations of central africa and northeastern africa.

population structure
analyses of molecular variance  and multidimensional scaling  analyses can provide further insight into the genetic diversification of chad basin populations, allowing us to compare geography and language as the main influences on population structure. first, we tested the influence of linguistic affiliation on hvs-i mtdna variability by grouping chad basin and other afro-asiatic populations living outside this area  according to language groups . we observed that only  <dig> % of variation was found among linguistic groups and only  <dig> % within groups. similarly, when these populations were grouped according to their geographic location , the distribution of variability proportions was  <dig> % among regional groups and  <dig> % within groups. these results show a similarly low effect of language and geography in determining population structure in and around the chad basin. with both linguistic and geographic groupings, the vast majority of mitochondrial variation  partitioned within populations, testifying to a low level of population structure.

we then estimated pairwise fst genetic distances between populations  and displayed these on a mds plot . interesting results are immediately evident – while chadic populations form a relatively homogeneous group, the cushitic populations split into two completely different clusters. the first group is composed of horn of african populations, such as ethiopian and somali cushitic populations, which are close to neighbouring ethiopian semitic speaking groups and relatively close also to chadic people from the chad basin. the second cushitic group is composed by more southern groups from tanzania, i.e. burunge and iraqw, who occupy outlier positions even within the afro-asiatic mds plot. in the mds plot, geography is more strongly associated with genetic distance than is linguistic affiliation. overall, we observe that chadic speaking populations are intermixed with other populations from chad basin, including niger-congo, semitic, and berber speaking people. in this context, it seems that the linguistic categories play a secondary role in structuring the genetic diversity.

discussion
we use high-resolution genetic data to investigate the genetic and linguistic support for hypotheses concerning the population history in the chad basin. the mitochondrial l3f <dig> haplogroup is found almost exclusively in chadic speaking populations and its tmrca corresponds well with archaeological and linguistic dates of the proposed migration of chadic speaking pastoralists from east or north east africa to the chad basin.

our tmrca estimates  and signatures of population expansions  for l3f1b and l3f <dig> appear to correlate well with the paleoclimatic record in african sahel, another highly overlooked data source in african genetic studies. this omission is surprising as the sahara is a region of dramatic environmental changes, with many oscillatory phases between arid-uninhabitable desert and humid-fertile landscape of lakes and savannah. these changes are driven by glacial cycles, with glacial conditions in the northern hemisphere being associated with cold and arid conditions over northern africa . our results suggest that following the emergence of l3f in east africa soon after the out-of-africa migration  <cit>  around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ybp, genetic drift and/or demographic decline occurred throughout the dryer, second part of late pleistocene. this conclusion can be inferred from the very long branches leading to many of the l3f sub-haplogroups. a dryer period in the latter part of the late pleistocene is supported by fossil evidence showing that during the lgm, some  <dig>  ybp, the sahara desert covered a much larger area than today  <cit> .

subsequently, in the post-last glacial maximum when climatic conditions had improved, an opportunity for population expansion and consequent mutation fixation again occurred, detectable mainly in our l3f1b data. l3f1b is widespread throughout africa and has also dispersed into the middle east with evidence of several new holocene-emerging sub-haplogroups. in fact, the sahara was repopulated during the first half of the holocene when humid conditions and greening were established by ~ <dig>  ybp, leading to the holocene climatic optimum. the optimum lasted till ~ <dig>  ybp, when the shift towards more permanent aridity occurred culminating with the formation of the current sahara desert. additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that a linguistically distinct part of the east african population migrated to the climatically suitable chad basin; specifically, our data demonstrate that the chadic-specific l3f <dig> clade expanded during the holocene. the age for l3f <dig> clade, based on mtdna coding region diversity , is remarkably concordant with archaeological findings for the proto-chadic migration. this clade might be then considered as a strong genetic signature of the chadic migration, which is highly correlated with paleoclimatic conditions. we can parallel the role played by l3f sub-haplogroups in climatic-related human population expansions in the sahara/sahel region with the western eurasian sub-haplogroups v  <cit> , h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . these haplogroups are european genetic signs of a re-settlement of the continent from an iberian refugium, after the improvement of climatic conditions post-last glacial maximum. as phylogenetic inferences improve, genetic signs of population contractions and expansions related with broad intense climatic changes are expected to be detected.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide genetic support for an early holocene migration within africa. a high-resolution phylogeny of haplogroup l3f based on whole mitochondrial genome sequences shows several clades that are unevenly distributed throughout africa and near east. specifically, clade l3f <dig> is geographically limited to the chad basin where it reaches high frequencies especially in chadic-speaking groups while almost absent in niger-congo and nilo-saharan people. within the afro-asiatic language phylum, the chadic branch is linguistically close to the east african cushitic branch although they are separated by ~ <dig>  km of territory in which different semitic and nilo-saharan peoples live today. we show that only northern cushitic groups from ethiopia and somalia are genetically close to chadic populations. thus, the archaeologically and linguistically supported route of proto-chadic pastoralists via wadi howar to the chad basin may have genetic support. moreover, our molecular genetic date for the chadic-specific l3f <dig> clade is consistent with the suggested holocene dispersal.
