BACKGROUND
myogenesis is a complex process regulated by a number of transcription factors, including myogenic determination factors myf <dig> and myod, and differentiation factors myogenin, myf <dig> and mef <dig>  <cit> . other factors, such as the tea domain transcription factor family, also play vital roles in myogenesis. tea domain proteins share a conserved dna binding domain and govern developmental functions in a variety of animal and plant phyla  <cit> . tead <dig> is a member of the tea domain family. previous studies have indicated that tead <dig> is constitutively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles in pigs, mice and humans  <cit> , and its disruption leads to heart defect and embryonic lethality in mice  <cit> . tead <dig> regulates the expression of many skeletal muscle-specific genes through binding to the m-cat motif  in the promoters  <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of tead <dig> to muscle-specific genes is implemented by co-operating with numerous co-factors, including mef <dig>  <cit> , vestigial like  <dig>  <cit> , vestigial like  <dig>  <cit> , and so on.

although mouse tead <dig> gene has been cloned and its dna binding and trans-activation domains have been characterized, the target genes of tead <dig> are unknown. considering the importance of tead <dig> to skeletal muscle development and the challenge of identifying direct gene targets of tead <dig> action, we have good reason to believe that chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with dna microarray analysis  would be an effective approach to identify direct target genes of tead <dig>  moreover, we choose to focus on the adult skeletal muscle because it is a well-studied target of tead <dig> function in development.

here, we identified  <dig> promoters significantly bound by tead <dig>  and we found that  <dig> genes had more than  <dig> tead <dig> binding sites. we analyzed the functional categories and pathways of the target genes. significantly, we found an important target gene, foxo3a, which plays a critical role in muscle growth and development. our data illustrate that tead <dig> is a mediator of skeletal muscle development.

RESULTS
identification of tead1-bound promoters by chip-on-chip analysis
with the aim of identifying the promoters bound by tead <dig>  we performed chip-on-chip analysis. chip with a tead <dig> antibody was done using mouse skeletal muscle tissues. in two biological replicas, the promoter regions of  <dig> genes showed a reproducible signal . all genes detected by the chip-on-chip assay are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  there are  <dig> genes , which have more than  <dig> putative tead <dig> binding sites.

to gain further insight into the biological importance of the target genes identified, we analyzed the functional categories of the annotated genes by examining their associated gene ontology. most of the targets took part in the cell process, physiology process, biological regulation metabolism and development process . we then carried out pathway analysis examining the biological function of the targets, and have found that the target genes mainly take part in mapk, mtor, t cell receptor, jak-stat, calcineurin and insulin signaling pathways. these pathways are related to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immunological regulation, growth and development.

validation of the foxo3a gene with chip-pcr
in order to verify the importance of the foxo3a gene found with chip-on-chip, we analyzed its enrichment using individual chip-pcr . Î²-actin was used as a negative control, and col1a   <cit>  was used as a positive control. amplified tead1-ip or igg-ip dnas along with input-dnas from skeletal muscles of three mice were pooled, with equal quantities of dna from each sample, and were then used as a template for pcr. validation of the enrichment of the foxo3a gene with chip-pcr is shown in figure  <dig>

confirmation of tead <dig> binding to the foxo3a promoter by emsa
as described above, the tead <dig> binding site in the promoter region of the foxo3a gene was confirmed with independent chip-pcr. we then employed emsa assays to directly address whether tead <dig> binds foxo3a in vivo. we synthesized specific oligonucleotides containing the tead <dig> element present in the foxo3a promoter in emsa experiments with nuclear extracts from mouse skeletal muscle tissues. as shown in figure 3a, incubation of skeletal muscle nuclear extracts with biotin-labeled tead1-foxo3a sequence produced a dna-protein band shift. these dna-protein complexes were determined to be specific to the tead <dig> site by successful competition assays using excess unlabeled tead1-foxo3a and mutant tead1- foxo3a oligonucleotides. to confirm the binding of tead <dig> to the tead1-foxo3a sequence, these emsa reactions were further incubated with anti-tead <dig> antibody. as shown in figure 3b, the addition of this antibody resulted in a supershifted complex in addition to the dna-protein band. these data confirm the presence of tead <dig> in the nuclear protein complex that binds the tead <dig> binding site of the foxo3a promoter.

the tead <dig> sequence is required for maximal transcriptional activity of the foxo3a promoter in c2c <dig> cells
sequence analysis of a partial foxo3a promoter revealed the presence of several consensus dna sequences known to be required for the binding of muscle-specific transcription factors . among them are e <dig>  e <dig>  mef- <dig>  myod, myogenin and tead <dig>  to evaluate the functional importance of tead <dig> in mediating the transcriptional activity of the foxo3a gene, the foxo3a promoter was tested by transient transfection assays in c2c <dig> cells. we then cloned the foxo3a promoter. if we were correct in assuming that the clone sequence represents the promoter of foxo3a mrna, then it should have promoter activity when inserted in the correct orientation with the transcription start-site upstream of the luciferase cdna. the fragment was cloned in both orientations  upstream of the luciferase cdna and transfected into c2c <dig> cells, and promoter activity was measured. as shown in figure 5a, only the fragment in forward orientation showed high promoter activity, whereas the one in reverse orientation did not. importantly, the orientation showing promoter activity was the correct orientation of the fragment to drive foxo3a mrna transcription.

the chip-on-chip result shows that foxo3a may be activated by tead <dig>  to determine if tead <dig> binding influences the transcriptional activity of the foxo3a promoter, we co-transfected the foxo3a promoter-luciferase reporter construct with a tead <dig> expression construct, and pcdna <dig>  was applied as a negative control . we found that, as expected, tead <dig> over-expression activated the foxo3a promoter, and a 10-fold increase in reporter activity was observed. thus, we can state that foxo3a promoter was regulated by tead <dig>  the exact mechanism by which tead <dig> regulates the foxo3a promoter will be discussed further below .

effect of tead <dig> on foxo3a transcription
in order to characterize the effect of tead <dig> on foxo3a transcription, firstly, we designed an over-expression experiment of tead <dig>  we transiently transfected the c2c <dig> cells, which constitutively expressed high levels of tead <dig>  measured using the pcdna <dig>  vector or pcdna-tead <dig> vector or lipofectamine  <dig> control. after  <dig> h, the cells were harvested and expression of foxo3a was assessed by quantitative real-time pcr . the result showed that foxo3a expression doubled as compared to the control.

to further investigate the functional consequences of aberrant expression of tead <dig>  we knocked down tead <dig> gene using the sirna experiment. we first determined the optimal conditions for the introduction of the negative control sirna with a fam encoding fluorescent protein like gfp. by adjusting the conditions, we were ultimately able to express fluorescent proteins in ~70% of cells . under those optimized conditions, introduction of a mixture of three sirna oligos targeting tead <dig> in c2c <dig> cells resulted in an 80% reduction in tead <dig> mrna levels, as compared with cells transfected with control sirna. after  <dig> h the cells were harvested and expression of foxo3a was assessed by quantitative real-time pcr . foxo3a expression was down-regulated by about 50%.

the over-expression and sirna results were consistent, and they support the conclusion that tead <dig> is specifically bound to and regulates the expression of the foxo3a gene. tead <dig> is also shown to be a mediator of skeletal muscle development.

discussion
chip-on-chip has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the complex network of regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their targets. it provides a new approach for examining direct transcription factor targets rapidly in an unbiased manner, which does not rely on previous characterization of a consensus sequence or a prior knowledge of gene expression patterns. in addition, we also used emsa and the luciferase reporter system to verify the biological reliability of chip-on-chip data.

go enrichment analysis shows that tead <dig> subtly regulates a large number of genes involved in the cellular process including cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, death and so on. in addition, some of the target genes of tead <dig> take part in mapk, mtor, t cell receptor, jak-stat, calcineurin and insulin signaling pathways. these pathways are related to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immunological regulation, growth and development. these results add an additional layer of regulation to the effects of tead <dig> in promoting cell growth and development. our results are in accordance with the reports suggesting that tead <dig> plays an important role in muscle development  <cit> .

foxo3a, a member of the forkhead o  family, has been shown to be involved in the regulation of skeletal and smooth muscle differentiation, proliferation and cell size regulation  <cit> . mice lacking foxo3a are apparently normal at birth, but develop cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure later in adult life  <cit> . foxo3a is also a downstream target of the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase /akt pathway. it controls two decomposing systems of skeletal muscle proteins independently: ubiquitin/proteasome and autophagy/lysosome. when foxo3a is activated, it causes muscle protein degradation and muscular atrophy through autophagy function. however, pi3k/akt can inhibit the activity of foxo3a, and hinder the atrophy process, thereby regulating the muscle atrophy  <cit> . elia et al  <cit>  reported that the activation state of the igf- <dig> signal transduction cascade reciprocally regulates mir- <dig> expression through the foxo3a transcription factor, and mir- <dig> expression was related to muscle cell growth and differentiation. all these results indicate that foxo3a plays a critical role in muscle growth and development, thus, we have chosen this gene to validate as a potential target gene of tead <dig>  and provide the basis for further function study.

tead <dig> can regulate transcription of the foxo3a gene through the binding to the m-cat element, demonstrated with independent chip-pcr analysis, emsa and luciferase reporter system assay. it is interesting to note that there is a mir-208b binding site in the antisense strand of foxo3a . mir-208b is a muscle-specific mir, and plays redundant roles in the specification of muscle fiber identity by activating slow, and repressing fast myofiber gene programs  <cit> . therefore, foxo3a may play a key role in the process of the transformation of muscle fiber types. the muscle fiber type directly affects meat color, meat tenderness and intramuscular fat content. therefore, future investigation of the effect of foxo3a on regulating the transformation of muscle fiber types is essential.

mef <dig> and nfat bind in the promoter of foxo3a , which leads us to suppose that foxo3a may take part in the calcineurin/mef2/nfat signaling pathway to promote the formation and transformation of skeletal muscle fiber types. at the same time, foxo3a is also a downstream target of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway  <cit> . under normal conditions, pi3k and akt are activated through insulin or insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  binding with their receptors, and then foxo3a is phosphorylated and deactivated, so skeletal muscle can develop normally. when insulin resistance occurs or igf- <dig> is lacking, this pathway is inhibited. foxo3a is not phosphorylated, skeletal muscle protein is degraded, which causes muscular atrophy, and consequently, muscle fiber can not transform normally.

it was preliminarily concluded that tead <dig> regulates foxo3a expression through calcineurin/mef2/nfat and igf-1/pi3k/akt signaling pathways in skeletal muscles. however, it is not known whether calcineurin/mef2/nfat functions as a downstream effector of the igf-1/pi3k/akt pathway or there is some other relationship. this question needs further study.

in summary, despite the stringency of the integrated analysis of chip and microarray data, novel tead <dig> candidate target genes were found and foxo3a was shown as being directly regulated by tead <dig>  our data thus suggest that tead <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and that different signaling pathways may co-operate with each other in a complex network of tead <dig> transcriptional regulation. these findings provide some important clues that will enable further analysis of the role of the foxo3a gene in formation and transformation of skeletal muscle fiber types.

CONCLUSIONS
our current results provide the first insights into the target genes of tead <dig> transcription factor in skeletal muscles, and the regulatory mechanisms and networks involved. the over-expression and inhibition analysis suggest that foxo3a was positively regulated by tead <dig>  in addition, we preliminarily concluded that tead <dig> may regulate foxo3a expression through calcineurin/mef2/nfat and igf-1/pi3k/akt signaling pathways in skeletal muscles. these findings illustrate that tead <dig> is a mediator of skeletal muscle development, and also provide some important clues that will enable further analysis of the role of the foxo3a gene in the formation and transformation of skeletal muscle fiber types.
