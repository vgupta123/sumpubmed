BACKGROUND
hair is a defining characteristic of mammals. the hair follicle is the only organ in mammals to undergo life-long cycles of growth, regression and quiescence  <cit> . hair development proceeds through a cycle of anagen in which hair follicles undergo rapid growth, catagen in which hair growth ceases due to apoptosis-driven regression, and telogen in which the hair follicle enters a period of relative quiescence  <cit> . longer hair can thus result from an increase in the length of time during which anagen proceeds. a loss-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor  <dig> gene  is responsible for the long hair phenotype present in angora mice, while a similar long hair phenotype occurs in mice homozygous for a null allele of fgf <dig> produced by gene targeting  <cit> . in mice, catagen does eventually occur even in the absence of functional fgf <dig>  indicating that other factors are also involved in the cycle  <cit> .

the fgf <dig> gene consists of three exons  <cit> . in wild-type mice and other mammals, the fgf <dig> transcript is present in two isoforms, with the smaller transcript due to alternative splicing in which exon  <dig> is excluded from the mrna  <cit> . the shorter transcript antagonizes the activity of the longer transcript, suggesting that they function together in hair cycle regulation  <cit> . in mice, the fgf <dig> mutation causing the long-hair angora phenotype affects exon  <dig>  <cit> . in dogs, sequencing of the fgf <dig> gene in  <dig> individuals from  <dig> breeds, including three dog breeds fixed for long hair and five breeds fixed for short hair, identified a missense mutation in exon  <dig> as responsible for the long haired phenotype  <cit> . in domestic cats, the fgf <dig> gene was shown to be associated with hair length  <cit> , with four independent mutations in exon  <dig> or  <dig> considered to be functionally significant in controlling hair length in a survey of more than  <dig> individuals from  <dig> short- or long-haired breeds, non-breed cats and two pedigrees  <cit> . in rabbits, mutations in fgf <dig> have been reported to have significant association with wool yield  <cit> . given that the species for which fgf <dig> is known to influence hair length belong to different superordinal placental clades that diverged ca.  <dig> million years ago    <cit> , it seems plausible to hypothesize that fgf <dig> may be a critical determinant of hair length across mammals.

the elephantidae, a family of proboscideans comprising the living elephants, their extinct relatives, and the extinct mammoths  <cit> , would constitute an important group for the comparative study of genes involved in regulating hair cover and growth. the woolly mammoth, mammuthus primigenius, was covered with hair ranging in length from a few centimeters to over  <dig> cm, with coarse outer hairs, beneath which were shorter, thinner hairs forming densely packed underwool  that formed a thermal insulating layer  <cit> . by contrast, extant elephants are sparsely covered with hair and have hair of short length  <cit> . given the role of fgf <dig> in determining hair length in a diverse set of mammalian taxa, we hypothesized that loss of function of this gene may play a role in the longer hair length of the woolly mammoth. we therefore generated and compared sequences of fgf <dig> from living elephants and the woolly mammoth. in addition, using a combination of bioinformatics analysis and dna sequencing, another gene related to hair phenotype in humans, type i hair keratin pseudogene   <cit> , was examined, as were three other genes coding for hair keratin proteins  <cit> .

RESULTS
the fgf <dig> gene was sequenced from a woolly mammoth and from two asian elephants , two african savanna elephants  and two african forest elephants    <cit> . for the woolly mammoth, protocols established for ancient dna were used  <cit> , with the complete fgf <dig> coding sequence obtained for indigirka mammoth n <dig>  a ca. 11000- <dig> year-old tooth from the indigirka river basin, federal republic of russia. pcr products from the indigirka mammoth were amplified from multiple extracts at two different laboratories , with  <dig> or more pcrs performed per fragment, and pcr fragments cloned and sequenced. among-clone variation was observed but no consistent differences among amplifications were detected. partial sequence was also obtained from the jarkov mammoth, a ca.  <dig>  year-old sample from the taimyr peninsula, federal republic of russia. .

asian elephant ema- <dig> is used as the reference sequence. dots represent identity to the reference. differences are shown as the base . the a/: at - <dig> for lcy-lo <dig> indicates a site with a  single nucleotide deletion. sites with character states unique to the woolly mammoth are in boldface. variable sites are numbered from the putative start position of exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> was identical across species. dash indicates sequences not generated for a sample.

the complete 5' utr, complete open reading frames  of the three exons, and part of the promoter region of the fgf <dig> gene were sequenced in the elephants and the indigirka woolly mammoth . all of the elephants as well as the woolly mammoth had an uninterrupted open reading frame . in each of the elephantids, exon  <dig> was  <dig> bp in length ; exon  <dig> was  <dig> bp; while the protein coding region of exon  <dig> was  <dig> bp, with  <dig> bp of the 3' utr also sequenced. the four boundaries between exons and introns were identical across all elephantids sequenced, thus fgf <dig> does not vary at these splice sites among elephantids. full sequencing of the two introns was not attempted due to their length:  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp for introns  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, in human, with even longer introns present in savanna elephant based on genomic traces . additionally, the mammoth genomic sequences  <cit>  were found to have poor coverage of both introns in the mammoth .

only two mammoth-specific differences were found: one in the promoter and one in exon  <dig> . the substitution in the promoter sequence  did not alter any predicted transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . the difference present in exon  <dig> of the mammoth was a guanine to adenine substitution at position  <dig> that was a silent mutation, i.e. did not alter the amino acid sequence . this substitution also did not lead to a rare codon being present in the mammoth. the mammoth fgf <dig> amino acid sequence was identical to that of  <dig> of the  <dig> extant elephant species. this suggested that all elephantids including the long-haired mammoths had a functional fgf <dig> protein.

the nucleotide sequence of fgf <dig> varied among living elephantids , although only one non-synonymous substitution was found among living or extinct elephantids. in both forest elephant individuals, exon  <dig>  contained a codon for glycine at residue  <dig>  whereas a codon for alanine was present in other elephantids at this position . this is a physicochemically conservative change  <cit> . among other mammals for which fgf <dig> sequence is available, this g33a mutation was found to be present only in the in rodent fgf <dig> protein sequence . the mutation is located at the n-terminus of the protein . the n- and c-termini of other members of the fgf family play key roles in the specificity of interaction with the fgf-receptors .  <cit> . however, this mutation resides within a mainly unstructured region, predicted to be an extended loop downstream of the signal peptide . thus, the g33a mutation in forest elephants would be unlikely to affect the secondary structure of the fgf <dig> protein. both glycine and alanine are nonpolar, neutral amino acids, with neighboring hydropathy indices  <cit>  in the hydrophobic range, which precludes prediction of their structural position, i.e. external or internal. the tertiary structure of this region could not be modeled, because the structure of this region has not been experimentally resolved in any member of the fgf family. analysis using sift and polyphen programs suggested that while the g33a mutation may increase the stability of the protein, the g33a mutation in forest elephants should not have serious consequences on fgf <dig> protein function .

human and mammoth fgf <dig> protein sequences were also compared  <cit> . fgf <dig> is predicted to be secreted and has an almost identical signal peptide sequence for the two species . the major difference between the two sequences is an insertion/deletion of three amino acids at the n-terminal region. this region is predicted to include many o-glucosylation sites, suggesting a putative difference in glycosylation between the two fgf <dig> proteins . the two proteins are predicted to have a unique n-glycosylation site at position  <dig> of the human sequence.

the general features of the amino acids of mammalian fgf <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  as are the phylogenetic relationships among fgf <dig> amino acid sequences. the fgf <dig> proteins are very similar across elephantids but differ from those of other mammalian fgf <dig> proteins. to test whether any of these differences would be predicted to alter the three-dimensional structure of the elephantid fgf <dig> proteins, the tertiary structures of fgf <dig> in different species were predicted. this analysis predicted that all described mammalian fgf <dig> proteins fold similarly . the structural analysis also revealed that the amino acid differences between human and mammoth fgf <dig> sequences  do not correspond to residues known to interact with the fgf receptor  and heparin  . the two amino acid differences between humans and mammoths that are included in the 3d model are predicted to be parts of loops and do not seem to affect the secondary or the tertiary conformation of the fgf <dig> molecule .

to examine the quality of sequence traces for the recently published genome sequence of the woolly mammoth  <cit> , the mammoth fgf <dig> dna sequences generated for this study were compared using blast to homologous sequences generated by the mammoth genome project  <cit> . five matching mammoth genome sequences were found, comprising sequence coverage of about 50% . coverage of the mammoth genome varied by region for the fgf <dig> gene. four genomic sequences matched the promoter and 5' utr; these covered 99%  of the corresponding region sequenced by the current study. there were  <dig> discrepancies among the traces covering this region. only one genomic sequence was found that overlapped with the coding regions, and it covered only 22%  of the sequence determined for the current study, with nine discrepancies found between genomic traces and our sequences. overall, four of the five mammoth genomic sequences had discrepancies with the mammoth sequences generated for the current study, with a total of  <dig> nucleotide site discrepancies detected. the discrepancies relative to our sequence likely reflect damage present in the ancient dna of the mammoths used to generate genomic sequences. similar ancient dna damage affected the mammoth sequences generated for the current study . for five pcr amplicons used in the current study to determine the sequence of the fgf <dig> promoter, the among-clone diversity was in the range 0- <dig> . unlike pcr-based approaches where multiple pcrs can be performed and multiple clonal sequences per pcr determined to generate a consensus sequence, the mammoth genome does not currently have high enough coverage per base to be confident that observed differences among traces, individuals or species represent the true sequence rather than ancient dna damage. thus although the mammoth genome is extremely useful for designing mammoth-specific primers and for initial queries, our data suggest that pcr, cloning and sequencing would still be required to determine mammoth dna sequences, to account both for ancient dna damage and gaps in the low-coverage genome sequences.

like fgf <dig>  other loci have been identified that are associated with reduced hair cover. in humans the type i hair keratin pseudogene krthap <dig> has a premature stop codon in the fourth exon, and protein is not detected in human hair follicles  <cit> . in great apes, the orthologous gene has an intact orf, with rna expressed and protein translated in the hair follicles of chimpanzees  and gorillas   <cit> . thus, while closely related primates with dense hair coverage express this gene, relatively hairless humans do not. using the loxodonta africana draft genome sequence, all of the homologous exons except for exon  <dig> for this gene were identified. exon  <dig> displayed a predicted premature stop codon . thus, as in humans, this gene appeared to be disrupted in the savanna african elephant. a  <dig> bp segment of exon  <dig> was therefore amplified and sequenced from the indigirka mammoth to examine the region that contained the premature stop codon in the elephant. the stop codon was found to be present in the mammoth as well , suggesting that this mutation is not involved in hair phenotype differences among elephantids.

among mammals, hair phenotype is affected by hair keratin genes  <cit> . we therefore examined keratin genes reported as displaying either elephant or mammoth unique differences  <cit> , using genomic sequences of savanna elephant or woolly mammoth  <cit> . krt <dig> was identified as having a unique alanine to serine change, but this was specific to only one of two woolly mammoths previously sequenced  <cit> . similarly, in the elephantids krt <dig> and krt <dig> were found to code for rare amino acid differences. however, only a methionine to valine change in krt <dig> was found to be unique to mammoths, while the methionine present in elephant krt <dig> was also present in the fully hair-covered hyrax. thus the differences in krt <dig> and krt <dig> are unlikely to be associated with differences in hair cover.

discussion
to date, the fgf <dig> mutations found to produce long hair have been uncovered in phenotypic variants among laboratory or domestic mammals, including mice, rabbits, dogs and cats   <cit> . a role for fgf <dig> in inter- as opposed to intra-species differences in hair length has not been established. nonetheless, the association of fgf <dig> mutations with long-hair phenotypes in a wide variety of distantly related mammals  suggested that fgf <dig> might be a determinant of hair length in mammals in general. to test this hypothesis we sequenced the open reading frames of all three exons, the 5' utr and the promoter region of the fgf <dig> gene in the relatively hairless extant elephantids and in the woolly mammoth. our data show that these regions of fgf <dig> are highly conserved among elephantids, including the woolly mammoth. only one variant in the amino acid sequence was detected among elephantids, the g33a mutation in forest elephants coded by exon  <dig>  however, our analysis suggested that this mutation would not greatly affect protein function, a conclusion also supported by the presence of same amino acid substitution in the wild-type sequence of fgf <dig> in murid rodents. while regulatory mechanisms may exist that would not be detectable by our study, and a role for fgf <dig> in the long hair of mammoths cannot be completely ruled out, the most parsimonious interpretation of our results suggests that fgf <dig> was not the major genetic determinant of long hair in mammoth.

similarly, no differences were found among elephantids for partial sequences of several additional candidate genes such as krthap <dig>  krt <dig>  krt <dig>  and krt <dig>  thus, none of the candidate genes examined thus far demonstrated a clear difference exclusive to mammoths, which would be necessary for establishing a role in their unique dense and long-haired phenotype relative to extant elephants. while a host of additional genes are known to influence hair development, many play other critical developmental roles and would likely be lethal if function were perturbed  <cit> . thus, future candidate genes will likely reside among the keratin and keratin-associated protein  genes, believed to play a role in the evolution of mammalian hair characteristics  <cit> . among mammals, krtap gene repertoires vary considerably, with homogenization within groups  <cit> , although the genes have not been catalogued in elephants or other afrotheres. once the savanna elephant genome is complete, keratin and krtap genes from this species may be identified as candidates for determining the hair differences among elephantids.

among living mammals hairlessness is more pronounced among fully aquatic species of sirenians and cetaceans ; thus the designation of humans and elephants as "hairless" is a relative term  <cit> . in the case of elephants, hairlessness may be a thermoregulatory adaptation to large body size  <cit> , which would be consistent with a gain of hair cover for the woolly mammoth  <cit> , since mammoths appear first in africa before the lineage adapted to colder environments  <cit> . in considering the evolution and genetics of hair cover in extant elephants, woolly mammoths and other proboscideans, a number of factors must be taken into account. first, it is difficult to determine based on outgroups whether hair cover was lost in extant elephantids or gained in the woolly mammoth. the presence of considerable hair cover in a distantly related outgroup to the elephantids, the american mastodon   <cit> , does not necessarily suggest that hair cover is ancestral. hair cover in the american mastodon may comprise a convergent adaptation to cold and/or aquatic habitats, rather than an ancestral state  <cit> . second, the proboscidean lineage that gave rise to both elephantids and mastodons is likely to have derived from aquatic or semi-aquatic ancestors  <cit> . although many semi-aquatic species are not hairless  <cit> , proboscideans derive from a common ancestor with the fully aquatic and hairless sirenians  <cit> ; while proboscidea and sirenia, along with hyracoidea , comprise the paenungulata, one of the few unresolved trichotomies among extant mammalian orders  <cit> . additionally, some ancestral proboscideans were as large as living elephants  <cit> , and if hairlessness is an adaptation to large body size in terrestrial mammals, it may have been the ancestral state in proboscideans  <cit> .

a third consideration is that, both in the case of the hyrax-sirenian-proboscidean clade and the elephantid clade, the evidence suggests that divergence of the ancestral line into two and then three descendent lineages occurred in quick succession. among the elephantids, nearly complete mtdna sequences have been generated for all three genera including mammoths  <cit> ; using the mastodon mito-genome as an outgroup suggests that loxodonta diverged from the common ancestor of elephas and mammuthus ca.  <dig>  mya; followed by the divergence of the two latter genera ca.  <dig>  mya   <cit> . the order of divergence among the paenungulata remains unresolved  <cit> , suggesting, as in the case of the elephantids, that the two divergences that yielded the three mammalian orders occurred in rapid succession. the rapid divergence of lineages in both cases suggests that incongruent lineage sorting of alleles may have affected many loci, causing discrepancies between gene and species trees  <cit> . interestingly, the mammoth and african elephant fgf <dig> sequences are identical at positions - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> of the promoter , while differing from the asian elephant sequence even though the asian elephant and mammoth are sister taxa  <cit> . this suggests that this region of the genome may have been subject to incongruent lineage sorting in which the gene tree does not match the species tree  <cit> , as has been reported for other gene segments  <cit> . thus both convergent evolution and incongruent lineage sorting may have affected genes involved in hair cover among the proboscidea.

CONCLUSIONS
although the gene for long hair in mammoths was not here identified, proboscideans remain an important group for understanding the evolution of hair cover. while most mammals have dense hair cover, humans and extant elephants are notable in being relatively hairless  <cit> , and both are closely related to species with much greater hair cover . both lineages are also noteworthy in being "genome-enabled"  <cit>  for the study of genes affecting hair cover. the human and chimpanzee genomes have been sequenced  <cit> , while the elephant genome is being sequenced  <cit> , and substantial coverage for the mammoth genome is now available  <cit> . other than aquatic species, the number of other mammalian genera considered to be "hairless" is quite small  <cit> . thus, for a comparative approach to the evolution of hair cover, proboscideans comprise an important group for further research.
