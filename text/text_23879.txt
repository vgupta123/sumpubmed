BACKGROUND
chloroperoxidase  is a heavily glycocylated monomeric hemoprotein secreted from the filamentous fungus caldariomyces fumago, with a sugar content of 18% of its molecular mass of  <dig> kda  <cit> . comparison of the x-ray crystallographic structure of cpo  <cit>  with other known peroxidases, namely cytochrome c peroxidase  <cit> , lignin peroxidase  <cit> , peroxidases from coprinus cinereus  <cit> , peanut peroxidase  <cit> , and horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme c  <cit> , reveals dramatic structural differences between cpo and these traditional heme peroxidases. for example, the proximal axial ligand of the heme iron in cpo is a cysteine  sulfur atom in common with the cytochromes p <dig>  rather than a histidine nitrogen atom commonly found in the traditional heme peroxidases. moreover, glu  <dig> is postulated to function on distal side of the heme prosthetic group as an acid-base catalyst in facilitating the reaction between the peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide with the formation of compound i. in contrast, most other heme peroxidases use a histidine to fulfil the same function  <cit> . these structural features shared with both heme peroxidases and cytochromes p <dig> make cpo the most versatile of the known heme enzymes. in addition to catalyzing chlorination, bromination, and iodination reactions  <cit> , cpo also catalyses other reactions characteristic of heme peroxidases , catalases  and cytochromes p <dig>   <cit> . most importantly, cpo is especially adept in catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of alkenes  <cit> , benzylic hydroxylation  <cit> , propargylic oxidation of 2-alkyenes to chiral alcohol  <cit>  and oxidation of organic sulfides to chiral sulfoxides  <cit> . the stereoselective abilities of cpo in chiral catalysis suggest that native cpo and/or engineered cpo mutants has the potential to become important industrial catalysts  <cit> . however, cpo is readily inactivated above 50°c  <cit> , limiting its use in many fields.

in general, enzymes show relative instability in solvents or at elevated temperature and lower activity in organic solvent than in water. these limit the industrial application of enzymes. chemical modification has now re-emerged as a powerful complementary approach to site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution for improving activity and stability of enzymes  <cit> . many research groups demonstrated that chemical modification of enzyme could enhance its activity or stability by different dicarboxylic anhydrides, such as phthalic anhydride , maleic anhydride , citraconic anhydride  and succinic anhydride  <cit> . these anhydrides react specifically with the ε-amino group of lysine residues and change its charges from positive to negative. our previous papers reported that horseradish peroxidase was chemically modified to enhance its activity and stability by phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride or citraconic anhydride  <cit> . hernandez et al. reported that the modified cpo by reductive alkylation, amidation and cross-linking showed higher stability than the native enzyme in 60% tert-butanol  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that addition of polyethylene glycol  <dig>  even without modification, enhanced the activity and stability of chloroperoxidase  <cit> .

in this study, cpo was chemically modified by phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride or citraconic anhydride. the changes of activity and stability after modification were investigated. the aim was to understand how these modifications affect its activity, stability and structure.

RESULTS
activity and kinetics
modification of lysine residues  was carried out by following the procedure described in the methods section. in order to optimize the ratio of the modified reagent and the enzyme, effects of the concentration of the modified reagents on activity at a fixed enzyme concentration were investigated. when  <dig> μl 50%  ca,  <dig> μl  <dig>  mm ma or  <dig> μl  <dig> mm pa was added to the mixture containing  <dig> ml  <dig>  μm cpo and  <dig> μl  <dig>  mm thioanisole, the biggest activities of these modified cpos were observed . under the conditions, the degree of modification was about 60%. it indicates that about 3/ <dig> amino groups seem to be modified.

steady-state kinetics was measured for sulfoxidation and phenol oxidation by native and modified cpos at a fixed concentration of hydrogen peroxide at room temperature in aqueous buffer and dmf. the oxidations follow michaelis-menten kinetics and the apparent kinetic parameters were shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  compared with native cpo, modified cpos showed similar apparent michaelis constant  values and greater kcat values, thus the catalytic efficiencies kcat/km were increased upon these modifications in aqueous buffer . the catalytic efficiencies  of ca-cpo, ma-cpo and pa-cpo for sulfoxidation in aqueous buffer were increased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the catalytic efficiencies of ca-cpo, ma-cpo and pa-cpo for phenol oxidation in aqueous buffer were enhanced by  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

however, there are different trends caused by the modifications in organic solvent. modified cpos showed lower km values and higher catalytic efficiencies kcat/km for both sulfoxidation and phenol oxidation in 15% dmf. it indicates that these modifications increased the substrate affinities, hence enhanced its catalytic efficiencies. for sulfoxidation in dmf, modified cpos had lower catalytic constants kcat than native cpo. the biggest increase in the catalytic efficiency of ma-cpo for sulfoxidation was observed about  <dig> -fold. khajeh et al. reported that kcat/km of ca-modified α-amylase from bacillus licheniformis was 3-fold higher that of native enzyme  <cit> . our previous papers reported that pa-modified horseradish peroxidase showed a higher catalytic efficiency for the oxidation of phenol  <cit> , and that ma- and ca-modified horseradish peroxidase had higher catalytic efficiencies for the oxidation of dye  <cit> . however, papains modified by ca, ma and pa showed lower catalytic efficiencies than native papain  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  we can find that the catalytic efficiencies of native and modified cpos for sulfoxidation were higher than that for phenol oxidation in both aqueous buffer and dmf. it indicates that thioanisole is more easily oxidised than phenol by cpo.

from table  <dig> and  <dig>  we can also find that no significant changes of the catalytic efficiencies for sulfoxidation in aqueous buffer and dmf were observed. however, the catalytic efficiencies for phenol oxidation in dmf were lower than that in aqueous buffer. it may result from the difference of the energy of substrate desolvation  <cit> . thioanisole is more energetically favourable for desolvation in dmf than phenol because of its higher hydrophobicity, hence retaining the catalytic efficiencies for sulfoxidation in dmf closer to that in aqueous buffer.

the dissociation constants of native and modified cpos were determined by the spectral titration approach and the data were given in table  <dig>  these modifications decreased the dissociation constant  for both thioanisole and phenol. it indicates that modified cpos showed greater the substrate binding efficiencies. as shown in table  <dig>  we can also find that the dissociation constants of both native and modified cpos for thioanisole were lower that for phenol, indicating higher binding efficiencies for thioanisole. it may arise from the higher hydrophobicity of thioanisole, leading to thioanisole more accessible into the active centre of enzyme.

stability
as indicated in figure  <dig>  treatments of cpo with these modification reagents resulted in a dramatic enhancement of its thermostability in aqueous buffer. after the exposure for  <dig> h at 50°c, native cpo retained only about 10% peroxidase activity and 20% sulfoxidation activity in aqueous buffer. modified cpos, however, retained about 30% peroxidase activity and 30% sulfoxidation activity. after single exponential fits of the thermal inactivation data, the apparent half-lives of native cpo, ca-cpo, ma-cpo and pa-cpo for peroxidase activity were  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively, k-values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these values are only for stability comparison. the thermostability of peroxidase of cpo was increased about 2-fold upon these chemical modifications. the apparent half-lives of native cpo, ca-cpo, ma-cpo and pa-cpo for sulfoxidation activity were  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively. thus, the thermostability of sulfoxidation activity of cpo was increased about  <dig> -fold upon these chemical modifications. chemical modification of horseradish peroxidase using ca, ma and pa brought about a dramatic enhancement of thermostability in aqueous buffer  <cit> . modified papain by ca, ma and pa  <cit> , and α-amylases by ca  <cit>  also showed higher stability than native enzyme.

dmf tolerances of native and modified cpos were compared. as shown in figure  <dig>  modified cpos had a greater tolerance of dmf. after the exposure of native cpo in 20% dmf for  <dig> h at 30°c, the sulfoxidation and peroxidase activities were completely inactive. however, the exposure of modified cpos in about 40% dmf for  <dig> h at 30°c just brought about the inactivity. our previous papers also reported similar results for horseradish peroxidases modified by ca, ma and pa  <cit> . o'brien et al. also reported that horseradish peroxidase modified by pa show higher thermostability and tolerance of dmf and thf  <cit> .

the modification of ε-amino groups of the lysine residues  alters the positive charge to the negative charge . cpo contains five lysine residues, lys <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig>  <cit> . the modification degrees of amino groups from cpo by ca, ma and pa were determined as about 60% of the native enzyme. this result indicates that about 3/ <dig> amino groups from native enzyme seem to be modified. thus, the greater stabilities of modified cpos likely arises from these modifications neutralizing positive lysine charges and then decreasing like-charge repulsions within the polypeptide as in the case of ca-, ma- and pa-modified horseradish peroxidase  <cit>  and ca- and pa-modified papain  <cit> . another possible explanation of modified cpos' additional stabilities is the effect of the introduced hydrophilic groups. these introduced hydrophilic anchors may reduce the contact area of the exposed non-polar residues with the water in the unfolding state. in other words, the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity results in an increase in the essential energy for exposing hydrophobic groups to water in the unfolding process and therefore, prevents it from incorrect refolding  <cit> . a third possibility is that the bulky groups attached to the  lysine residues provide new opportunity for the occurrence of the hydrogen bonding, hence prevent the unfolding and denaturation of the protein  <cit> .

immobilization of enzyme is still the most commonly used technique to improve the stability of enzyme. sangeetha and abraham demonstrated that immobilization of chemically modified enzyme is a useful strategy for reuse of enzyme as well as improving the thermal stability of the biocatalyst  <cit> . they reported that the stability of the modified papain was further increased by immobilization of the enzyme either by adsorption onto inert matrix or by entrapment in polysaccharide polymeric gels. thus, the effects of immobilization of these modified cpos on activity/stability would be further investigated.

spectra
in order to explore the mechanism of the enhancement of activities and stabilities upon these modifications, cd and fluorescence spectra of native and modified cpos were determined. cd spectra in uv and uv-vis regions provide information on the structure of protein and prosthetic heme of cpo. fig.  <dig> shows cd of native and modified cpo in water. native and modified cpos have identical cd spectra with negative bands at  <dig> and  <dig> nm , which agreed with the previous results  <cit> . the spectral shapes of both modified cpos are almost identical to those of native cpo. the percentages of secondary structure elements calculated using k2d software. no significant changes in the secondary structure content were observed by both modifications .

the fluorescence emission excited at  <dig> nm arises solely from the tryptophan residues. thus, the tryptophan fluorescence was used to probe the structural change of modified cpos compared to native cpo. figure  <dig> shows that the tryptophan fluorescence emission blue shifted from  <dig> nm of native cpo to  <dig> nm of modified cpos. it indicates that the tryptophan residue of the modified cpos became less exposed and located in a less polar environment. from figure  <dig>  we can also find that the intensities of the tryptophan fluorescence emission were increased after modifications because of a change in the relative orientation or distance between the heme and the tryptophan residue leading to a decrease in the efficiency of energy transfer  <cit> . this also denotes that the distance between the heme and the tryptophan residue increased  <cit> . another explanation for pa-cpo having the biggest intensity of fluorescence may be pa modification introduced a bulky benzene ring structure onto the lysine side chain  <cit> .

cd and fluorescence is a useful conformation probe for the studying of heme proteins. the changes of modified other heme-protein have been detected using spectroscopic technique. peg-met-hemoglobin showed up to 10-fold higher activity, greater substrate affinity and the catalytic efficiency  than unmodified protein  <cit> . they also found that there was a red shift on the soret band after modification. carboxymethylated cytochrome c had greater catalytic activity and higher tryptophan fluorescence intensity than native cytochrome c  <cit> . pa-, ma- or ca-modified horseradish peroxidases showed similar catalytic and spectrum properties to these modified cpos  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
chemical modification of cpo by ca, ma or pa increased their catalytic efficiencies, and thermostabilities in both aqueous buffer and dmf. in aqueous buffer, modified cpos showed a similar km values and greater catalytic efficiencies kcat/km for both sulfoxidation and phenol oxidation compared to native cpo. however, in organic solvent , modified cpos had lower km values and higher catalytic efficiencies kcat/km than native cpo. these modifications also improved their thermostabilities by 1~2-fold and solvent tolerances of dmf. fluorescence spectra proved that these modifications changed the environment of tryptophan. the improvements of the activity and stability are related to side chain reorientations of aromatics upon both modifications.
