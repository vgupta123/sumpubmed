BACKGROUND
canine tumors resemble human malignancies at cellular, phenotypic, and genomic levels, and dogs may serve as a more realistic cancer model system since their larger body size is more amenable to different surgical techniques and enables better evaluation of biodistribution of drugs and biotherapeutics than laboratory rodent models . because of the unmet therapeutic need in treatment of domestic animal neoplasms and the prospect of using pet cancer patients to narrow the gap to human clinical translation, the development of novel biological therapies to address canine malignancies is justifiable. such therapies include oncolytic viruses, many of which are capable of infecting also non-human cells  <cit> . oncolytic viruses replicate preferentially in tumor cells and may potentially spread to distant metastases via the circulation. in addition, virus infection triggers inflammation which under optimal circumstances can break tumor immunosuppression and evoke anti-tumor immune responses  <cit> .

alphaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense rna viruses of the family togaviridae, and some of them have shown promising oncolytic potential in preclinical model systems  <cit> . as animal viruses, alphaviruses may prove ideal candidates for development oncolytic virus therapies for dogs. moreover, while most alphavirus strains show neurotropism allowing these viruses to pass the blood–brain-barrier to infect cells of the central nervous system , oncolytic alphaviruses based on nonvirulent strains remain apathogenic and are spontaneously cleared by the immune system  <cit> .

in previous studies, oncolytic alphavirus va <dig>  which is based on an attenuated a <dig> strain of semliki forest virus , was capable of eradicating human brain tumors and melanoma xenografts in immunocompromised mice following just a single intravenous injection  <cit> , while in other occasions intratumoral administration route was proven superior . oncolytic capacity of attenuated sfv and also other alphaviruses is dependent on the lack of type i interferon responses in the tumor cells  <cit> . however, little is known about sfv infections in dogs. in an early study, virulent prototype sfv strain caused neurologic signs of infection in puppies when administered intraperitoneally and intracerebrally but was asymptomatic upon intranasal, intradermal, or intracardial exposure  <cit> . the oncolytic capacity of sfv or any other alphavirus has not been investigated in canine cancer cells.

we hypothesized that attenuated sfv can infect and kill canine cancer cells and that it can be safely given to dogs intravenously. to test our hypothesis, we infected, as a proof-of-concept, two canine osteosarcoma cell lines  in vitro with sfv vector va7-egfp and assessed virus replication and cell killing. in addition, we performed a minimal safety study in non-tumor bearing adult beagles using ~ <dig> ×  <dig> plaque forming units  of the unmodified parental virus sfv a <dig> given via intravenous infusion. our results show, on one hand, that dog tumor cells are able to support replication of oncolytic sfv, and on the other hand, that a limited inoculum of virus does not elicit side-effects in healthy adult dogs. these results pave the way for clinical translation of attenuated sfv in canine cancer patients.

RESULTS
cultured canine cells are permissive to sfv
we first tested the oncolytic capacity of attenuated sfv in canine cancer cells by infecting two canine osteosarcoma cell lines, abrams and d <dig>  at various plaque-forming unit  to cell ratios  with our reporter virus va7-egfp. infection was productive in both cell lines, as seen by progressive increase in virus-expressed fluorescent reporter protein, concomitant with progressive cytopathic effects  and cell loss . oncolysis was more pronounced in abrams than in d <dig> cells at 48 h  . the rate of oncolysis was comparable to sensitive human glioma cells  <cit> .fig.  <dig> va7-egfp infects and kills the canine osteosarcoma cell lines abrams and d <dig>  twenty-five thousand cells were plated on 48-well plate and infected next day with multiplicity of infection   <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  the experiment was carried out as three replicates with identical results . a infection with attenuated sfv vector va7-egfp was productive in both abrams and d <dig> cells, as demonstrated by progressive increase in virus-expressed green fluorescent protein over time , concomitant with virus-induced cytopathic effects seen in the corresponding phase contrast micrographs . b infection resulted in cell loss, shown by crystal violet staining at 48 h post infection , where absence of staining indicates cell loss. c quantification of acid-solubilized crystal violet from experimental wells in  demonstrated that oncolysis by sfv was virus dose-dependent, and that abrams cells displayed slightly greater susceptibility to oncolysis with all mois tested. one asterisk represents p =  <dig>  and two p ≤  <dig> , respectively. values are shown in means and error bars indicate standard deviation



intravenous administration of sfv displayed good safety in adult beagles
two adult female laboratory beagles were administered by intravenous infusion approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of non-recombinant parental sfv a <dig>  accounting for a degree of virus inactivation in saline during animal preparation. we kept the injection dose relatively low to assess potential self-amplifying viremia, which is a hallmark of alphavirus infection in susceptible mammalian hosts  <cit> . neither dog showed any clinical signs of infection in any time post infusion. total white blood cell and differential counts are presented in fig.  <dig> and clinical chemistry in table  <dig>  these results revealed only a minor decrease in serum albumin concentration in dog  <dig> 3 weeks after virus administration, while low blood glucose was detected in dog  <dig> 1 week and in dog  <dig> 3 weeks after virus administration. further, dog  <dig> had slightly low sodium concentration three weeks after virus administration. in addition, both dogs had low serum bilirubin, protein, and cholesterol already at baseline compared to the reference values, which remained at similar levels during the study.fig.  <dig> white blood cell count over time in dog  <dig>  and in dog  <dig>  after semliki forest virus infusion. sfv did not cause significant changes in any blood cell counts over the duration of the study. leuk, leukocytes; neutr, neutrophils; mono, monocytes; lym, lymphocytes; eos, eosinophils; bas, basophils

infectious sfv was not detected in the sera, urine, or feces of the dogs
in order to determine the sensitivity of our virus detection assay in feces, a negative baseline sample  from each dog was spiked with  <dig> pfu and diluted in dmem. virus recovery from these samples as shown by plaque assay was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ <dig>  g  and  <dig>  × 105/ <dig>  g pfu  in dog  <dig> and dog  <dig>  respectively. thus, using the lower recovery rate, the smallest theoretical amount of feces giving at least one plaque in the assay was  <dig> pfu/g. live virus could not be recovered from any of the analyzed serum, urine, or fecal samples. the theoretical detection limit for liquid samples was  <dig> pfu/ml.

sfv infusion induced high levels of nabs
levels of neutralizing antibodies  in serum samples collected before virus injection and  <dig> and 21 days post infusion were determined by plaque inhibition assay.

nabs were not present at baseline, while nab titers of  <dig> on day  <dig> and  <dig> on day  <dig>  respectively, could be detected in both dogs. our results thus indicate that both dogs had obtained virus and mounted a humoral immune response in the absence of detectable viremia.

sfv administration did not induce histopathological changes
necropsy and histopathology showed no specific findings associated with the virus administration. no virus antigen was detected in any of the organs analyzed.

discussion
oncolytic viruses carry great potential as broadly active cancer therapeutics, as they simultaneously interfere with multiple cell survival signaling pathways and trigger inflammatory responses, which, in turn, may expose the tumors to the immune system. in the present study, we have assessed the potential of a promising oncolytic candidate, attenuated sfv, to target canine cancer. like most human and rodent cancer cell lines in culture  <cit> , also the two tested dog tumor cell lines were permissive to the virus . thus, sfv harbors intrinsic killing capacity against dog tumor cells, a prerequisite for the virus as a potential therapeutic for canine cancer.

while using a broader panel of dog tumor cells may reveal relative degrees of permissiveness to sfv, we have noticed that tumor sensitivity to lysis in vitro may not correlate to therapy efficacy in vivo, rendering extensive in vitro killing assays unwarranted  <cit> . stromal cells and physical barriers contribute to restriction of virus spread in vivo, as infection triggers local inflammatory responses principally mediated by type i ifn to which the tumor cells may respond  <cit> . paracrine cytokine signaling also serves to control alphavirus infection before further innate and adaptive immune responses have time to take place. however, in normal amplifying hosts, this signaling is sufficiently low to allow for systemic replication . indeed, the attenuated a <dig> used in our study typically induces in susceptible mammalian hosts an asymptomatic viremia of up to  <dig> pfu/ml, lasting 1–4 days . however, we did not detect any infectious virus in the blood, urine, or feces in the experimental dogs at any time post infusion, suggesting that healthy dog tissues are poorly permissive to sfv, resulting in absence of viremia and viral shedding. in theory, the used input dose of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu could have been too low to give rise to detectable viremia. while we cannot completely exclude this possibility, we do not believe it to be the case as very few viral particles are required for productive infection in susceptible host. depending on the route of inoculation , as little as 3– <dig> pfu constitute the 50 % protective dose for attenuated sfv strains against lethal sfv strain challenge, with productive replication and 100 % protection reached with  <dig> pfu administered peripherally  <cit> . of note, rabbits, which are significantly larger than mice, still required only  <dig> pfu to receive 50 % protection against lethal challenge, and while protection against lethal virus challenge may occur in the absence of viremia, it does require productive replication, as defective or inactivated sfv elicits poor protective immune responses compared to live virus  <cit> . therefore, the avirulent sfv strain infection in normal animals is self-regulating and may present as viremia and/or neutralizing anti-sfv antibody response.

the neutralizing antibody response observed in both dogs in the present study indicated productive infection by the attenuated sfv, although no infectious virus was recovered from any blood samples or from the secretions. this is in line with the results from a recent study in healthy dogs injected with vesicular stomatitis virus, where infectious virus could not be detected in blood at any time post injection, but still all dogs developed antiviral antibodies from day  <dig> onward  <cit> . in a study with oncolytic adenovirus injected intravenously in healthy dogs infectious virus was not measured, but neutralizing antibodies increased already 4 days after virus administration  <cit> . so far, the only dog study in which infectious virus has been recovered after injection was with vaccinia virus, but the virus was recovered only from blood samples taken immediately after the intravenous administration  <cit> . also in that study, neutralizing antibody responses were demonstrated 2 weeks after virus injection. the relevance of the anti-viral antibodies in oncolytic virotherapy remains incompletely understood, as their presence did not seem to correlate with treatment efficacy for example in patients receiving oncolytic vaccinia-  <cit>  or adenovirus . however, the apparent difficulty to detect infectious viruses in dogs suggests rapid absorption of a number of different oncolytic viruses. this may have implications for intravenous delivery or systemic spread of oncolytic viruses in treatment of canine cancer patients. on the other hand, poor permissiveness of normal dog tissues to oncolytic viruses may be beneficial from a safety perspective.

oncolytic adenovirus has so far showed excellent safety in tumor-bearing  <cit>  and healthy dogs  <cit> , likely owing in part to its restricted species tropism. oncolytic vaccinia virus was reported to induce mild fever and an apparent epileptiformic seizure in healthy beagles  <cit> . several mild to moderate adverse events and one severe liver toxicity resulting in euthanasia were reported in healthy beagle dogs receiving high-dose oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  <cit> . unlike vesicular stomatitis virus, attenuated sfv can be safely injected intracranially in adult animals, where virus replication remains confined to mainly perivascular foci  <cit> . cd8+ t-cell-mediated elimination of the virus may in certain mouse strains be associated with demyelination , but such effects are transient and without apparent clinical symptoms  <cit> . notably, we did not see any pathological changes or cellular infiltrates in the dog brains post-mortem.

in light of the poor capacity of sfv to replicate in dogs upon intravenous injection, clinical application of the virus in canine cancer patients would most likely entail intratumoral virus injections ensuring successful delivery of the virus into the tumor mass. this route has occasionally proven to be therapeutically superior over systemic administration even in susceptible hosts  <cit> . theoretically, sfv could amplify in tumors of canine cancer patients, disseminate into the blood and then be spread during the viremia by aedes mosquitos endemic in the tropical areas  <cit> . hence, viremia and shedding parameters should be established separately for canine cancer patients in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the first proof-of-principle data for semliki forest virus as a candidate oncolytic agent in dogs. as our results demonstrate, live attenuated sfv va7-egfp was able to replicate and kill canine osteosarcoma cells in vitro, and parental a <dig> strain was safe causing no visible symptoms or distress in the laboratory beagles. no virus could be detected in any of the organs, blood or secretions analyzed. our findings support proceeding with sfv mediated oncolytic virotherapy to first stage clinical studies in canine cancer patients.
