BACKGROUND
china has a wide variety of indigenous chicken breeds, most of which can only be found locally in rural areas. because these breeds are geographically dispersed and have not been subjected to intense artificial breeding, they display unique characteristics as a result of the local environment and/or different breeding objectives than for commercial chicken. because of the different traditional food cultures across china, native broiler chickens have meat quality characteristics that are often favoured by consumers over those of commercial breeds. several previous studies found that such characteristics include greater tenderness and preferred flavours  <cit> . therefore, the native chicken breeds not only contribute to the conservation of poultry genetic resources, but are also of high economic value.

to evaluate the potential for genetic improvement of the productive efficiency of the native huiyang beard chicken  breed while maintaining its valuable market properties, including high meat quality and unique appearance, we established an f <dig> intercross between the slow-growing hb and the fast-growing commercial broiler breed “high quality chicken line a” . we aimed to identify genes contributing to differences in productivity between these populations. our first objective was to explore the genetic basis of the measured growth-related traits in this f <dig> cross.

in broilers, most economically important traits are growth-related. in this study we focused on six groups of such traits, which we expect to have been under positive selection during the commercial breeding of broiler chickens, including body weight at different ages, and efficiency of feed conversion. qtl mapping has previously been used to determine genomic regions affecting such quantitative traits in other mapping populations, and has identified a large number of qtl  <cit> .

as these qtl are generally mapped with low marker density, lack of the genomic information could lead to the less accurately estimated recombination frequency or fail in detecting all the recombination events within the cross. therefore, additional efforts by utilizing the recently developed genotyping platforms, which can rapidly and economically genotype a high density of snp markers and have been widely applied to major farm animal species, such as cattle  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and chickens  <cit> , can be helpful in replicating and confirming these qtl.

in the last few years, the interest in identifying epistatic qtl effects has increased. epistasis is when the combination of alleles at two, or more, loci yields a phenotype that cannot be explained by the independent effects of the involved loci  <cit> . a number of epistatic qtl have been identified in chicken for growth traits  <cit> , and here we further explored the importance of gene-by-gene interactions in the genetic architecture of growth traits in this intercross.

the aim of the present study was thus to identify the main loci contributing to the phenotypic growth variability in this indigenous × commercial broiler f <dig> intercross, and estimate their direct and epistatic effects by conducting a genome-wide linkage analysis.

RESULTS
all phenotypic measurements, units, and abbreviations are summarised in table  <dig> 

trait correlations
the pearson’s correlations between all pairs of phenotypes conformed to expectations, but they varied in strength . there were high and positive correlations  between live body weight , growth rate , shank length , and shank circumference . feed conversion ratio  was negatively correlated  with stomach weight , bw and gr, and positively correlated with abdominal fat weight . afw was negatively correlated  with sl at the later stages of growth. all the correlations mentioned above were significantly different from zero .

one-dimensional qtl scan
we performed qtl analyses for  <dig> traits related to body-size in chickens. forty-four qtl were detected for  <dig> traits  on six chromosomes at two different significance levels. five qtl were genome-wide significant at the 5% level, whereas all others were significant at the 1% level . figure 1a shows the genome-wide qtl profile for bw <dig>  while figure 1b and 1c present the qtl profiles for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> for several selected traits from all six groups .

 <dig> *5% genome-wide significance. **1% genome-wide significance.  <dig> the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the detected qtl.

as shown in table  <dig>  most of the detected qtl clustered to distinct locations in the genome. the exception were the qtl mapped on gga <dig>  where peaks were distributed across two overlapping clusters - one cluster centred around  <dig> cm and the other around  <dig> cm. fitting both these locations in a two-qtl model did not allow us to discriminate whether there were two independent signals on the chromosome, or if they represented the same qtl with slightly shifted peaks for the different traits. further analyses in other populations are needed to explore this region further.

the  <dig> detected qtl were categorized into nine independent qtl. we named each qtl by combining an abbreviation for the cross  and the number of the chromosome where the qtl was located. in addition, when multiple distinct qtl were located on the same chromosome, letters were added at the end indicating their order along the chromosome. for example, cau_ab 1a represent the most proximal qtl on gga <dig> 

four out of the nine independent qtl affected several of the analyzed traits and were therefore classified as being pleiotropic. qtl cau_ab 1a affected the intermediate to late growth stage of bw, while cau_ab  <dig> was associated with the late growth phase of sc. two qtl  affected almost all measured growth traits in this cross, which was consistent with the fact that high correlations existed among the traits affected by these qtl. cau_ab 1c, on the other hand, affected fcr and the early stage of bw, traits that were not significantly correlated. the remaining five qtl only affected single traits. for the traits recorded at multiple time-points in life, such as bw, sc, and sl, differences were found in the sets of qtl controlling the traits in the different growth stages. more qtl, with larger average effects, were found for growth at intermediate and late growth phases than for early growth.

positive additive effects, implying enhanced growth associated with the alleles originating from the fast-growing hqla line, were observed for most of the traits. most of the exceptions  were detected for afw and sc. the hqla line is leaner than hb, and consequently this observation is consistent with the expectations, as a negative additive effect indicates that hb alleles increase afw. interestingly, both lines had positive effects on sc in different qtl regions. the proportions of residual phenotypic variance explained by the detected qtl ranged from 3–18%, with the largest effects from cau_ab 1c and cau_ab  <dig>  it is worth to note that estimation of the genetic variance associated with the detected qtl is generally biased upward  <cit> . in a population of the size used here, only a slight upward bias is expected and therefore the estimates are provided to facilitate a comparison of the relative contribution of the inferred qtl to the observed phenotypic variance in this intercross population.

two-dimensional qtl scan
epistatic qtl mapping
we observed significant epistatic interactions for four traits in  <dig> distinct regions on  <dig> chromosomes . by also examining suggestive interactions , we found that these belonged to coherent peaks, although they did not reach the significance threshold. therefore, we defined the significant epistatic qtl pairs to be interactions between qtl-peak regions rather than interactions between single marker positions.

as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  additive-by-additive interactions contributed a large proportion of the total epistatic effects for four out of the five interacting pairs. the only exception was for the pair affecting bw <dig>  where the dominance-by-dominance effect was most significant.

 shows the genotype-phenotype map for the interacting pairs. each pair had a unique epistatic pattern, indicating complicated interactions between the loci.

in summary, interactions were often identified in the same regions for consecutive growth phases of the bw traits, even though not all reached the significance threshold . this indicates that the identified interacting effects act throughout extended growth periods. the inferred epistatic pairs explained 6–8% of the residual phenotypic variance, which is substantial given the size of the qtl detected in the single-qtl scan.

identifying candidate epistatic genes in known biological pathways
in contrast to the results from the single-qtl scan, where correlated traits often shared the same qtl, the epistatic analysis identified mostly novel regions . when examining the  <dig> epistatic regions in more detail  <cit> , genes from the same kegg biological pathway  <cit> , ubiquitin mediated proteolysis , were found in seven of the  <dig> regions . the genes belonging to the ump pathway across the genome and in the identified epistatic regions are presented in figure  <dig>  using a  <dig> -fold permutation test, we estimated that the probability of observing such a seven-locus overlap with the gene from ump pathway was only  <dig> % . the ump pathway is a temporally controlled and tightly regulated process, which plays major roles in a variety of basic pathways during cell life and death. hence, it is crucial for cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . for the qtl pairs affecting fcr 6– <dig> and fcr 8– <dig>  we also found possible interacting candidate genes in a growth-related pathway, the erbb signalling pathway, which is known to affect intracellular signalling pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, cell motility, and survival  <cit> . genes in the erbb pathway were also identified in the epistatic regions for gr 4– <dig>

discussion
this study describes the genetic dissection of  <dig> growth related traits in a chicken f <dig> population. forty-four qtl were identified,  <dig> of which belonged to one of four major pleiotropic qtl regions, while the remaining five each affected a single trait. the co-localized qtl did, however, explain different amounts of residual phenotypic variance for different traits. given the correlations among traits, this high degree of pleiotropy observed for the qtl was not surprising. for instance, the hqla allele at cau_ab 1c increases both growth rate and size of the digestive organs, a correlated response that has been observed in previous physiological studies  <cit> . the pleiotropic effects of this qtl on many traits investigated in this study are in the direction preferred in selection programs for increased productivity, as the hqla allele improves the performance of traits like bw and sl, while at the same time decreasing afw and fcr. these characteristics of the qtl make it an interesting candidate for further studies to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to selection for faster growth in chickens.

the qtl cau_ab 1c, which affects many traits in this cross, is located at the distal end of gga <dig> . this location overlaps with several earlier reported growth qtl in the chicken qtl database  <cit> . interestingly, it also maps very near to a  <dig> -mb region  on gga <dig>  identified in a recent gwas study examining growth differences between the white recessive rock and the xinghua chicken   <cit> . most of the other qtl mapped in this study also overlap with earlier reported qtl  <cit> . we did, however, find that these loci have larger genetic effects and higher statistical significance in this study. this could be due to the more informative genetic markers used, but also a reflection of the larger divergence between the founder lines for the studied traits. this would, in turn, indicate that these loci have been important for the selection response while breeding broiler chickens and that there exist multiple, distinct alleles at these loci in the global chicken population. further in-depth molecular dissection of these loci could therefore help to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying important traits in broiler breeding.

no significant result was found for gr 8– <dig>  despite the strong signals detected for both bw <dig> and bw <dig>  also, no significant qtl was detected for fcr 10– <dig>  which was consistent with the observation that gr 8– <dig> was strongly correlated with fcr 10– <dig>  this result indicates that late gr is not controlled by the same loci as early gr, and that fewer loci with large individual effects appear to be involved in late gr, which is consistent with earlier findings in chicken  <cit> .

the epistatic analysis identified significant interactions for four traits, all affecting the birds between 6– <dig> weeks of age. this is the same time-period where the highest statistical significance for qtl was found also in the single locus analysis. the epistatic qtl identified at different times appeared to have a much more complicated pattern than that revealed in the single-qtl scan. even so, for some traits such as bw, we could conclude that the same epistatic qtl pairs were identified for late growth , while different qtl pairs were found for early growth . both the results from the epistatic analysis and the single locus scan are consistent with earlier findings that different sets of genes regulate early and late growth  <cit> .

 shows the two-locus genotype-phenotype maps for the detected epistatic pairs. all displayed complicated interaction patterns, two of which were found to be more intriguing. these two pairs affected bw <dig> and gr <dig>  and had significantly larger phenotype values when both the interacting qtl were homozygous for the allele with a hqla origin. this pattern is consistent with the selective breeding scheme that has been applied in the founder lines. also, it suggests that selection for growth is not acting only on independent alleles at single loci, but also on combinations of alleles at multiple loci.

compared to the single-qtl analysis, the relatively large genetic variances explained by the pairs detected in the epistatic analysis suggested that epistasis is an important contributor as some of the pairs explained more than the minor single qtl effects. interestingly, the five epistatic qtl pairs involved  <dig> independent regions across  <dig> autosomes, indicating that the detected epistatic loci each provide novel insights into the genetic basis of the studied growth traits. it is somewhat surprising that none of the highly significant qtl detected in one-dimensional analysis were involved in significant epistatic interaction with other regions across the genome. this low degree of overlap between qtl identified in one- and two-dimensional scans, however, illustrates the need to perform both single-qtl and epistatic qtl analysis to better dissect complex quantitative traits.

most of the epistatic regions contained genes from the ump, or related, pathways. the ump pathway contains  <dig> genes across the chicken genome   <cit> . a permutation test estimated that the probability of obtaining such an overlap by chance was about  <dig> % , indicating that this result is unlikely to be a coincidence. further studies of this pathway will hopefully be able to provide new insights to the genetics of growth-related phenotypes.

because of its cost efficiency and ease of use, we genotyped the birds using a dense snp chip. while the high marker density does not immediately help to narrow qtl regions because of the lack of recombination events in the f <dig> design, it does help to increase the precision of the line origin estimation. much work remains to identify the causal mutations underlying the traits, but two regions are of particular interest. further studies of the cau_ab 1c region on gga <dig> and the entire gga <dig> are highly promising, as the effects at those loci are particularly strong. in addition, the epistatic analysis identified interesting qtl regions where a set of possible candidate genes that are part of the same biological pathway are located. as sequencing technology becomes more affordable, re-sequencing can be used to search for potential functional polymorphisms between the lines in the highlighted regions as a way to identify the causal genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we performed a genome-wide qtl analysis in an indigenous × commercial broiler f <dig> intercross. a single-qtl analysis revealed nine distinct qtl regions with significant effects on  <dig> traits. these qtl were often pleiotropic, which is consistent with the observed correlations between the studied traits, and mostly mapped to regions identified in earlier chicken studies. the genetic effects of these loci were, however, greater in this study than in previous reports. second, an exhaustive search for epistatic effects identified five distinct interacting qtl pairs. the epistatic qtl did not, however, overlap with the results of the single-qtl analysis, which indicates that epistatic combinations of loci might have contributed to selection response in addition to the single qtl, but that these are more dependent on the allelic combinations available in the founders. for seven of the  <dig> epistatic qtl, we found candidate genes belonging to the ump pathway, suggesting this as a potentially important pathway in the regulation of growth in chicken.
