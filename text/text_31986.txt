BACKGROUND
the subfamily caprinae includes a widespread and diverse group of ungulates  that are most extending from the arctic to the equator. wild caprinae were the ancestors of two of the most important species of domestic livestock - domestic sheep  and goats . present day populations of wild caprinae represent a potential source of knowledge of adaptation genetics which can be used to improve or adapt current domestic breeds to less productive conditions  <cit> .

sheep was one of the first species to be domesticated, approximately  <dig>  years before the present in the fertile crescent  <cit> , due to its small size, docile behavior and high adaptability to very different environments. this domestication process must have involved a genetically broad sampling of wild stock and also the persistence of cross-breeding with wild populations  <cit> . domestication pressure over animal’s life had as consequence that natural selection loosed impact over their biological fitness giving up the turn to artificial selection imposed by humans over productive traits . however, sheep is one of the livestock species managed under low intensive systems and therefore could have retained from its wild ancestors some genome footprints in genes related to environmental adaptation.

climatic factors like temperature and humidity play an important role in determining species distributions and they likely influence phenotypic variation of populations over geographic space  <cit> . correlations between phenotype and environment may be revealed by genetic polymorphisms which allele frequencies strongly differentiate populations that live in different environments  <cit>  and such differences can be maintained in the face of gene flow  <cit> .

several studies have examined the distributions of genetic variants in candidate genes for traits that vary with climate. for example, in humans, candidate gene studies have yielded evidence that variants involved in sodium homeostasis and energy metabolism  <cit>  and those related with type  <dig> diabetes and obesity  <cit>  are strongly correlated with climate variables. also a decrease in the frequency of variants implicated in salt sensitive hypertension had been correlated with increasing distance from the equator  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, variants involved in circadian rhythms, aging and energy metabolism were correlated with climate  <cit> , in arabidopsis thaliana, variants associated with flowering time were correlated with latitude  <cit> , and in pines several genes contain variation have been correlated with temperature  <cit> .

the heat shock response is among the most important and ubiquitous fact in nature. heat, both quantitatively and qualitatively is one of the best inducers of heat stress proteins . they act as molecular chaperones, helping to maintain the metabolic and structural integrity of the cell, as a protective response to external stresses. the chaperone hsp <dig> is one of the most abundant, highly conserved and usually heat-induced proteins found in all eukaryotes studied so far. hsp <dig> gene presents two isoforms, hsp90-α  and hsp90- β . there are only few publications on the role of hsp <dig> function in species adaptation and survival under extreme conditions  <cit> . the gene encoding the hsp90α heat-shock protein  has been extensively studied in sheep  <cit> . differences in the hsp90aa <dig> transcription rate  <cit>  depending on genotype combination of some polymorphisms located at its promoter and the environmental conditions existing when sample collections have been shown. also an effect of these polymorphisms over ram’s sperm dna fragmentation depending on environmental temperatures has been assessed  <cit> .

this work has the aim to study the relationships between the frequencies of  <dig> polymorphisms located in the hsp90aa <dig> gene promoter in  <dig> sheep breeds from different locations of the european, asian and africa continents and the climatic and geographic variables prevailing in the regions where these breeds are reared; and to characterize the hsp90aa <dig> promoter sequence in  <dig> species of the caprinae and in  <dig> species of the bovinae subfamilies to determine polymorphisms history and contribute to elucidate the phylogeny of one of the most controversial subfamily of the sub order ruminantia.

RESULTS

genotype and allele frequencies of the  <dig> polymorphisms studied in each of the  <dig> sheep breeds are showed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  levels of polymorphism were generally high in all breeds. there were no private alleles in any of the breeds studied. the less polymorphic marker was the snp g.522 > g for which the g allele was fixed in  <dig> breeds. for the indels g.666_667insc and g.516_517insg, the d allele was fixed in nine and six breeds, respectively.table  <dig>

it is outstanding that seven polymorphisms had the maf for the same allele in all breeds . however, the maf for g.703_704dela, g.660g > c and g.528g > a polymorphisms were the aa- <dig>  c- <dig>  and a- <dig> alleles in five asian  and one european  breeds, while for the remaining breeds were the d- <dig>  g- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles .

the hardy weinberg equilibrium test for all breeds joined  shows all polymorphisms in hw equilibrium except for the indels g.666_667insc and g.703_704dela. the average expected  and observed  heterozygosis were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for all breeds joined.

linkage disequilibrium  was estimated to obtain polymorphism linked blocks across and within breeds. additional file  <dig>  shows the ld matrix for all populations and for each breed separately and also a figure of ld blocks and haplotypes. in most breeds, similar ld than those previously observed in manchega spanish breed   <cit>  were obtained. thus, three ld blocks of polymorphisms can be established: g.666_667insc_g.444a > g; g.703_704dela_g.660g > c_g.528a > g and g.601a > c_g.524g > t_g.468g > t.

phylogenetic relationships between sheep breeds
additional file  <dig>  shows population pairwise fsts, p values and significances and the reynolds’s distance matrix among the  <dig> sheep breeds studied. average, median, maximum and minimum distances across populations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. among aw, sz, as, cl, lx, kar, dgl, karm and edil breeds distances higher than  <dig>  were observed. breeds with distance values lower than  <dig>   among them were found for arme, ch, kry, mnch, aka, cauc, bni, bouj and boz.

figure  <dig> shows neighbornet graph based on reynold’s distance constructed with the clusternetwork splits transformation method for the  <dig> sheep breeds studied. the lsfit  of the neighbornet was  <dig> .figure  <dig>

the group constituted by edil, karm, kar, dgl, krc, krb, baj and boz breeds is outside the reticulations of the neigbornet graph, indicating a certain degree of separation of this set from the remaining breeds. all these breeds have in common that belong to regions of west asia and east europe with high thermal width . average, minimum and maximum distances among these breeds were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the remaining breeds are included in a complex system of reticulations which indicates the existence of a genetic admixture among them  <cit> . as and aw breeds are joined in the same branch, as should be expected due to high genetic linkage . kvr, sz, me and cl breeds come from the same node. all these breeds belong to mediterranean regions with low thermal width and semi-damp climates. average, minimum and maximum distances among these breeds were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

figure  <dig> shows the histogram of the number of significant different populations  for each of the sheep breeds studied using the exact test of population differentiation. the number of significant different populations ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and the average was  <dig> .figure  <dig>

tests to detect association of loci frequencies with environmental parameters
plsr
plsr analysis was conducted including the maf of six polymorphisms as response variables and  <dig> environmental variables as predictors . polymorphisms considered were g.667_668insc, g.522a > g, g.516_517insg and one polymorphism of each ld block common to most breeds: g.666_667insc, g.660g > c and g.601a > c. for all polymorphisms analyzed, the allele at lower frequency  was the same in all breeds . however, the g- <dig> allele of the g.660g > c snp was the maf in  <dig> from the  <dig> breeds studied.

basic statistics, and pearson and spearman correlations among maf and environmental variables are shown in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> , respectively. high negative pearson  and spearman  correlation coefficients were found between maf of g.667_668insc and g.660g > c . a positive and moderate  spearman correlation was found for g.667_668insc and g.666_667insc . regarding correlations among environmental predictors high  negative correlations  were found between lat-minat, lat-ant, lon-minat, minat-tw and ant-tw; and positive between lon-tw, minat-ant and tar-mxr. only significant correlations among maf and environmental predictors were found for g.667_668insc, g.666_667insc and g.660g > c. similar magnitude but with opposite sign had the correlations found between g.667_668insc and g.660g > c with minat, ant, tw, tar and mxr.

a second plsr analysis including six polymorphisms and ten environmental variables were developed. predictive residual sum of squares  of the complete  and reduced  models were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which indicates that the elimination of  <dig> useless environmental variables improve the prediction model. reducing the number of predictors, r <dig>  was also improved from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

three components were retained using the optimal model determination by the leave-one-out cross validation procedure and the minimum press criteria . the  <dig> % of the predictor variation is already explained by just two, but only  <dig> % of the response variation is achieved. figure  <dig> shows vip and vt <dig> values for each of the ten environmental predictors included in the model. taking into account for both statistics, minat, ant, tw, tar and mir were the predictors with the best combination of vip and vt <dig>  however, environmental variables, as lon and mxr despite having high vip values showed percentages of the variance explained below 50%.figure  <dig>

predicted variation  values obtained as in equation  were calculated for the maf of the six polymorphisms included in the plsr model. q <dig> values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for i- <dig>  i- <dig>  g- <dig>  a- <dig>  a- <dig> and i- <dig>  respectively. only for i- <dig>  i- <dig> and g- <dig> q <dig> values exceed the acceptable threshold .

regression coefficients for responses with q <dig> values higher than  <dig> , are shown in figure  <dig>  showed regression coefficients of scaled and centered variables for all predictors and responses). absolute values of regression coefficients ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . interestingly, regression coefficients of i- <dig> and g- <dig> have opposite sign for all environmental predictors, except for mir, indicating that the maf at these polymorphisms depends on opposite environmental and geographical circumstances. thus, the frequency of the i- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles increases and decreases respectively, for higher values of minat, ant, tar and hra. otherwise, high values of lat, lon and tw are linked to low and high frequencies of the i- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles, respectively.figure  <dig>

no association with environmental variables was found for the snp g.522a > g alleles. maf alleles i- <dig>  i- <dig> and g- <dig> were associated with the highest number of environmental variables,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the environmental variables related with more number of loci were mxr, ant, lon, minat, tar and tw .

figure  <dig> shows correlograms of significant associations between markers and environmental variables, which differences in probability of presence of the allele between the extremes of the distribution were higher than 37%. minat is the environmental variable for which greatest changes was shown in the probability to find the g- <dig> allele. a decrease in this probability from  <dig>  to near  <dig>   was found for g- <dig> when minat increases from -22°c to 17°c. an opposite trend was observed for i- <dig>  in this case, the likeliness to find de i allele increases from  <dig>  to near  <dig>   for the same rank of minat change. for ant and mxr the same pattern above described was found. for tw an opposite pattern was observed. so the probability of the g- <dig> allele increases from  <dig>  to  <dig>   for  <dig> units of increment in tw , and the probability of the i- <dig> allele decreases from  <dig>  to  <dig>   for the same rank of tw variation.figure  <dig>

characterization of the hsp90aa <dig> promoter in species of the caprinae and bovinae subfamilies
aligned sequences of a <dig> bp amplicon from the hsp90aa <dig> gene promoter of a total of  <dig> species belonging to the caprinae and bovinae subfamilies are shown in additional file  <dig> . species from the ovis genus show 99% similarity with ovis aries, followed by capra hircus and ovibos moschatus both with a similarity of 98%. the least similar species to ovis aries were bos mutus  and bos taurus . additional file  <dig>  shows haplotypes frequencies in each species studied. in o. aries  <dig> different haplotypes were found. from them only the first four  had a frequency higher than 10%. in o. musimon all the haplotypes found were shared with o. aries. o. canadiensis had not polymorphisms in the sequence analyzed. c. hircus showed  <dig> different haplotypes but only one was found in c. pyrenaica.

the tamura 3-parameter model  with evolutionary rates among sites modeled by using a discrete gamma distribution  with  <dig> rate categories had the highest fit  among the  <dig> different nucleotide substitution models tested by maximum likelihood. this model was fitted to estimate evolutionary divergence between species sequences, to conduct the tajima’s neutrality test and to construct the ml tree.

table  <dig> shows estimates of evolutionary divergence over sequence pairs between species. within the caprinae subfamily, the r. pyrenaica showed the highest percentage of sequence divergence with the remaining species  than to those of capra, ammotragus and rupicapra. as expected, very low evolutionary divergences among species of the ovis genus and among the species of the capra genus were observed.table  <dig>

the three indels g.703_704dela, g.667_668insc and g.666_667insc existed simultaneously only in o. moschatus, o. musimon and o. aries. c hircus had the two contiguous g.667_668insc and g.666_667insc, and o. ammon and r pyrenaica the g.703_704dela. the highest frequency of the i- <dig> allele, related with heat stress tolerance, was found in o. musimon  and o. moschatus  followed by o. aries  and c. hircus . the snp g.660g > c seems to be exclusive of the caprinae subfamily. unfortunately, this region is a sequence of several consecutive cytosines and therefore is difficult to know if there is not mutation at - <dig> position or if the c- <dig> allele is fixed in bos. anyway, c appears to be the wild allele of the g.660g > c snp.

tajima’s neutrality test  <cit>  conducted for the sequences of the hsp90aa <dig> promoter was - <dig>   which reveals an excess of low frequency polymorphisms relative to expectation . this fact could indicate a purifying selection removing alleles that diminish animal’s biological fitness but also the presence of “young” beneficial mutations going to higher frequencies.

figure  <dig> shows maximum likelihood bootstrap original and condensed trees based on the tamura 3-parameter model and inferred from  <dig> replicates. the tree was constructed considering only haplotypes with frequencies higher than  <dig> . branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. the analysis involved  <dig> nucleotide sequences. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. out-group species  were located in a separate branch with a high bootstrap percentage . one branch were constituted by species of the capra and ammotragus genus  and other branch by those of the ovis, rupicapra and ovibos ones . in the ml consensus tree, o. moschatus was located as a sister species of r. pyrenaica. species from the ovis genus  appear mixed since many haplotypes are shared among them and promoter sequences showed a high degree of similarity.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies from our group pointed out the existence of different expression profiles in sheep carrying alternative genotypes of some polymorphisms located at the hsp90aa <dig> gene promoter depending on environmental temperatures  <cit> . the join genotype of the g.667_668insc and the g.660g > c polymorphisms had the highest effect on the expression rate of the gene and on the sperm dna fragmentation levels  <cit> . animals carrying the ii-668-cc- <dig> genotype showed higher expression rate  of the hsp90aa <dig> gene than those with dd-668-cc- <dig>  dd-668-cg- <dig> and dd-668-gg- <dig> under heat stress environmental conditions   <cit> . at the phenotypic level the ii-668-cc- <dig> combined genotype had the lowest values of sperm dna fragmentation  compared with the remaining genotypes, when heat stress events occurs along the spermatogenesis process  <cit> .

the results above described may contribute to clarify the phylogeographic relationship for some sheep breeds and the opposite correlations observed between the frequency of the i- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles and some climatic and geographic variables from the locations where they are reared. since the i- <dig> allele is responsible of the upregulation of the gene under heat stress conditions, high frequency of this allele is expected to be found in climates with high minimum  and average annual  temperatures  and therefore with low thermal width  . despite no significant correlation was found among total annual rainfall  and maximum rainfall  with minat and ant, the frequency of the i- <dig> allele seems to be also associated with changes in these last variables. thus the i- <dig> allele frequency is high in climates with high minat, ant, tar and mxr values and low tw values.

looking at climatic variables of countries where those breeds are reared  we can observe that semi arid  regions showed greater average tw  and average ant  and lower average minat  than semi damp  locations . also in sd locations tar and mxr values  are much higher than those of sa regions . therefore, as sd are heater than sa regions, it is possible to hypothesize that heat events accompanied with high rainfall in sd regions could be more stressful since thermal stress increases when high temperatures and high relative air humidity go together  <cit> . in this sense, paim and colleagues  <cit>  described that thi  had a great influence on animal superficial temperatures, demonstrating that this is able to characterize the animal response to environment. however in this work any association was found between this variable and polymorphisms frequencies.table  <dig>

regarding the g- <dig> allele in the gene promoter, opposite results than those of the i- <dig> were observed, which agree with the transcription results above mentioned. the g- <dig> allele is linked to the lowest expression rates of the hsp90aa <dig> gene under both heat stress and mild temperature conditions. therefore high frequencies of such allele are only expected in breeds reared in regions with low minat and ant temperatures and high tw, in which heat is not a critical source of stress. the negative association of the g- <dig> frequency with minat  and ant  and positive with tw  agree with such expectations. however, high frequencies of the c- <dig> allele were found in all kind of locations but predominating in breeds reared in hot climates. this could be due to the genetic exchange that occurred during the development of modern breeds more than to adaptation processes. linkage disequilibrium  between g.667_668insc and g.660g > c is little than  <dig>  in the whole breeds and range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  across breeds, however d- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles are completely linked in the  <dig> animals genotyped, constituting the most thermo sensible haplotype  <cit> .

on the basis of reynold’s distances, two groups of breeds showing the minimum distances between breeds within group and maximum distances with breeds of the other group can be established. the first group was constituted by krc, krb, kar, dgl, karm and edil breeds and the second group by me, pram, sz, as, kvr and cl breeds. among breeds of these two groups, average, minimum and maximum distances were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in these two groups of breeds, opposite frequencies of the two polymorphism most related with gene expression differences  were observed. thus, in the first group of breeds the average frequencies of the i- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in all these breeds the g- <dig> allele was that with the maximum frequency and the i- <dig> allele had a frequency <13%. in the second group of breeds average frequencies of i- <dig> and g- <dig> alleles were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in all these breeds the i- <dig> allele frequency was >30% and the g- <dig> allele had a frequency <33%. interestingly, all breeds from group  <dig>  except karm, are reared in sa or a climates, mainly from asian regions. on the contrary, all breeds from group  <dig>  except me, are reared in sd mediterranean climates. average minat, ant, tw, tar and mxr were - <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in group  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively, in group  <dig>  q <dig> values higher than  <dig>  were only found for i- <dig>  i- <dig> and g- <dig> suggesting the action of natural selection in driving the differential allele frequency distribution of these polymorphisms among sheep populations. therefore, a correlation between genetic  and environmental  variables among some sheep breeds have been established which demonstrates that despite of the great admixture existing among them and its domestication status, some footprints of the natural selection action can be glimpsed. this fact may be due to the general low artificial selection exerted over breeds of this species and their semi-extensive or extensive management conditions which may have retained some genes related with adaptation to environmental conditions existing in nature. thus, breeds reared in sd climates, in which high temperatures and humidity are sources of physiological stress, have high frequency of alleles  related to higher expression rates of the hsp90aa <dig> gene as response to heat stress. however, low frequencies of these alleles were only found in those breeds reared in climates in which heat and humidity levels are not enough to induce a heat stress response. the frequencies of a- <dig>  a- <dig> and i- <dig> alleles  are not influenced by climatic conditions and therefore its presence in the hs90aa <dig> gene promoter seem to have no impact in the adaptation to environment of the ovine species. this finding was already suggested by  <cit>  by notice that these polymorphisms did not produce expression differences among genotypes when comparing rna samples obtained under heat stress and thermo-neutral conditions.

in a large study where  <dig>  snps were genotyped in  <dig> sheep breeds,  <cit>  some signs of directional selection in two candidate genes located at chromosome  <dig> , in which also the hsp90aa <dig> gene is located, were found. one of them was abhd <dig>  which has, among other functions, a role in the response to wounding. this protein that interacts with ubc  has a high expression rate in testicle  and correlates with hspa1l . hsp <dig> is a well known protein involved in the heat shock response which is part of the hsp <dig> complex. therefore, although authors  <cit>  recognize that the identification of adaptive alleles has not been achieved, some footprints of directional selection over genes more or less directly related with adaptive traits can be found.

when assessing evidence for an ecocline, it is crucial to control for population history and structure, for accurately assessing whether a correlation between a genetic variant and geographic or climate variables is due to natural selection  <cit> . for example, if migration patterns correspond closely with variation in a particular climate variable, the correlations between neutral alleles and that climate variable may be high even if selection has not acted on the locus. conversely, if selection effects are lower to that of population structure on allele frequencies, correlations may be underestimated if population history is not taken into account  <cit> .this is the reason why plsr and sam approaches cannot be used independently, without comparing results with specialized statistic methods based on population genetics theories, and focus on the analysis of genetic data as the bayesian test of beaumont and balding . thus, among all loci-environment associations detected by plsr and sam methods, only the frequency of two polymorphisms, the g.703_704dela and the g.522a > g, seems to be under the action of some selective process. the g.703_704dela showed a high fst outlier which makes it a candidate to directional selective processes. the low fst outlier of the g.522a > g snp reveals the possibility of balancing selection acting over its frequency. the g.703_704dela is highly linked with the g.660g > c snp  ranging r <dig> values in most breeds from  <dig>  to  <dig>  thus, directional selection predicted for the g.703_704dela could be extended to the snp g.660g > c for which differential expression of the hsp90aa <dig> gene has been assessed depending on genotype  <cit> , but not with the g.667_668insc. the high degree of conservation in ld phase found in this sort sequence in almost breeds, independently of their geographic origin, could indicate that high levels of gene flow have occurred between populations following domestication, as is suggested by kijas and coworkers  <cit> , but also, a selection pressure exerted over this dna region  <cit> .

the bovidae family includes more species than any other extant family of large mammals, but their phylogenetic relationships remain largely unresolved in part because it appears to represent a rapid, early radiation into many forms without clear connections among them  <cit> . furthermore, certain morphological traits have evolved several times within the family to create evolutive convergences that obscures true relationships  <cit> . the subfamily caprinae includes bovids adapted to extreme climates and difficult terrains. fossil records are poorly documented but the group first appeared during the upper miocene  <cit> . in a recent work, a complete estimate of the phylogenetic relationships in ruminantia has been proposed combining morphological, ethological and molecular information  <cit> . the resolution of the supertree varies among groups and some component clades, particularly caprinae , are much less well resolved than others . in particular, the position of the genera budorcas and ovibos has been controversial, having at times constituted the tribe ovibovini, and at others been separated and located in different tribes. in general, the genus ovis is split into a “new world” clade represented by o. dalli and o. canadensis and an “old world” clade including the two sister species o. vignei and o. aries, on the one hand, and o. ammon, on the other hand  <cit> . in our work, haplotypes from o. vignei, o canadiensis and o. musimon appeared mixed with those from o. aries. o. aries and o. musimon share many polymorphic sites  as expected from the past hybridization between both species.

ropiquet and hassanin  <cit>  using mitochondrial and nuclear dna sequences located a. lervia closer to goats  and o. moschatus closer to r. pyrenaica. however, in recent works  <cit>  a. lervia was closer to rupicapra genus within the caprina tribe and o. moschatus was distant from them within the ovibovina tribe. our tree located a. lervia as a sister species of c. hircus and c. pyrenaica  and r. pyrenaica closer to o moschatus . in the work of matthee and davis  <cit>  using data from nuclear dna a politomy for c. hircus, o. moschatus and o. aries was found. however, when analyzing nuclear dna joined to mtdna data, c. hircus and o. aries appear as sister species separated from o. moschatus. in our work we have observed a relative high similarity between o. moschatus, o. aries and o. musimon species regarding polymorphism shared among them.

although o. moschatus is currently restricted to greenland and the arctic archipelago  <cit> , a higher frequency of alleles related with the heat stress response  were found in this species. fossils of this species have occasionally found in southwest europe, so that’s why it seems that ovibos did not inhabit exclusively cold tundra during the pleistocene  <cit> . praeovibos, an older morphotype of o moschatus, does not appear to have been restricted to inhabiting cold climates as its remains have also been identified in temperate and mediterranean forest  <cit> . in contrast to modern ovibos, praeovibos was distributed over much more southern latitudes, samples have been found as far south as france and spain  <cit> , which indicates that praeovibos is an early more cosmopolitan form of muskox  <cit> . could these high frequencies of alleles related with the heat stress response found in o moschatus came from its praeovibos ancestor? lent  <cit>  indicates that muskox is sensitive to both climate warming and fluctuations, that is why campos and colleagues  <cit>  hold these factors responsible of the actual confinement of the muskox to greenland and the arctic archipelago but not a human impact. our results regarding the polymorphisms of the hsp90aa <dig> gene in this species seems to indicate that the actual muskox is genetically well prepared to tolerate warm climates. therefore, which could be the reasons to its actual geographic limitations? climate change is known to affect not only animal’s thermo sensitivity but also by triggering vegetation change  <cit> . increasing temperature pushed the adaptive vegetation balance firmly towards bogs, shrub tundra, forest and low-nutrient acidic soils, which resulted in communities of conservative plants highly defended against herbivore and supporting a small biomass of large mammals  <cit> . palmqvist and coworkers  <cit>  in an ecomorphological analysis of the early pleistocene fauna of venta micena , provide interesting clues on the physiology, dietary regimes, habitat preferences and ecological interactions of large mammals.

unexpectedly, a. lervia which colonizes arid and hot areas of the rocky mountains of north africa  is not polymorphic for the mutation most associated to the upregulation of the hsp90aa <dig> gene induced by heat stress events. it is probably that in this species, as in the bos genus, other genetic mechanisms exist to cope with stress imposed by climatic conditions.

regarding those polymorphisms for which our group has detected some relation with hot climates adaptation by its association with the expression rate of the hsp90aa <dig> gene under heat stress conditions , it’s noteworthy that they were only segregating in c. hircus, o. moschatus, o.musimon and o. aries. because there were only one sample of o. vignei and two of o ammon, any conclusion from these two species can be extracted. it seems reasonable to hypothesize that these polymorphisms could come from an ancestral species common to the ovis, ovibos and capra genera but not to ammotragus. however also it is possible that the evolvability of this gene may be due to its physical susceptibility to mutagenesis and therefore that the similitudes/differences found in the species analyzed does not be related with their phylogenetic relations.

CONCLUSIONS
we have assessed that despite the domestication process occurred  <dig>  years bp, sheep breeds showed some genetic footprints related to climatic variables existing in the regions where they are reared. thus artificial selection carried out by humans to improve productive traits in this species seems to be occurred concurrently with natural selective forces for traits related with the adaptation to environmental conditions. adaptation of breeds to heat climates can suppose a selective advantage to cope with global warming caused by climatic change. polymorphisms of the hsp90aa <dig> gene detected in the ovis aries species can be used in selection programs to improve animals resistance to heat environments. mutations of the ovine hsp90aa <dig> gene promoter are also been found in wild species from the caprinae subfamily, indicating a great antiquity of these mutations which can help us to elucidate how climatic conditions have evolved in the past.
