BACKGROUND
nod <dig>  is a member of the family of the nacht/lrr receptors, which are characterized by a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain and a c-terminal sensor domain consisting of repeats of leucine-rich repeats   <cit> . the lrrs of nod <dig> have been described to directly or indirectly recognize intracellular muramyl-dipeptide , an abundant cell wall component of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the recognition of mdp leads to a recruitment of the protein kinase rip2/rick to the n-terminal effector binding domain, which consists of two adjacent caspase-recruitment domains . subsequently, the canonical ikk/iκb/nf-κb pathway is activated via induced proximity signaling  <cit> . nod <dig> has been identified as the first major susceptibility gene for crohn's disease   <cit> . three genomic variations within the nod <dig> gene, one frameshift  and two missense mutations  represent the main causative functional variants and are associated with a deficient activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa b  upon microbial triggering  <cit> . it has recently been shown that pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as tnf-α, ifn-γ and lipopolysaccharide  activate nod <dig>  gene expression in intestinal epithelial cell lines and primary intestinal epithelial cells as well as monocytic hl- <dig> cells  <cit> . this up-regulation is at least in part dependent on the binding of nf-κb to a proximal κb-binding element  of a nod <dig> promoter region in front of the canonical first exon.

while performing the mutation detection and gene model verification of nod2/card <dig>  we performed cross-species comparisons and est database analyses that indicated an incomplete annotation of the 5' region of the gene. we have thus investigated the genomic region of the nod <dig>  locus for the evidence of additional upstream exons. we show that two additional untranslated exons exist located upstream of previously described first exon of the nod <dig>  gene, which are present in transcript isoforms that exclude the previously reported canonical exon  <dig>  these two exons exhibit a distinct splicing pattern under pro-inflammatory conditions both in vitro  and in colonic biopsies from patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease  in vivo. a long isoform, which contains both novel exons, contains three short upstream open reading frames , which are shown to inhibit translational efficacy of the respective transcript. the results provide evidence for a complex regulation of nod <dig> expression that includes the alternative usage of two promoters and post-transcriptional regulation of translation by uorfs.

RESULTS
database and inter-species comparisons of the nlr family
database sequences and cross-species comparisons indicated that the current annotation of the 5' – part of the nod2/card <dig> transcript is incomplete: the card <dig> gene structure as annotated in the genbank record af <dig> was comprised of  <dig> exons with the translational start in exon  <dig> and the stop codon in exon  <dig>  the northern analysis as reported by ogura showed two transcripts in peripheral blood leukocytes  <cit> . furthermore, card <dig> mrna isoforms in the databases differ in their 5' part and in the number of exons .

a comparison of the 5'utrs of the card <dig> mrna species and those of the other members of the nod family, apaf- <dig> and card <dig>  indicated striking differences. both apaf- <dig>  and card <dig>  transcripts exhibit much longer 5'utrs as compared to  <dig> or  <dig> nucleotides in the deposited card <dig> mrnas. inspection of the genomic locus of card <dig> revealed another discrepancy in the locus organization of card <dig>  while the first exons of apaf- <dig> and card <dig> are located in cpg islands and their positions are predicted at the respective genomic loci by a commonly used promoter/first exon prediction program, the 5' end of the card <dig> gene is not found in such a context. the gene structures of card <dig> and card <dig> indicate that the two genes are paralogues, because their exon/intron architecture is very similar with respect to both exon sizes as well as intron phases. this similarity is not present in the 5' parts of the genes.

an interspecies comparison of the human  and murine  and bovine  transcripts of card <dig> shows a lack of homology upstream of exon  <dig> .

additional upstream exons of the card <dig> gene
we scanned  <dig> kb upstream of exon  <dig> with the firstef program  <cit> . the program detected no cpg island in front of the previously described exon  <dig>  the prediction program detected a promoter and first exon within a cpg island about  <dig>  kb upstream of exon  <dig> of the card <dig> locus. rt-pcr with primers located in this predicted exon and in the known exon  <dig> was performed. two amplicons were obtained from cdna of peripheral blood leukocytes . cloning and sequencing revealed that the smaller species corresponds to the predicted first exon spliced to exon  <dig> of card <dig>  the larger amplicon contained an additional exon included between the new exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  which corresponded to an exon predicted to belong to an independent grailed-homology transcript  <cit> . canonical splice sites are flanking the intervening sequences on the genomic dna . we name these newly identified exons 1a and 1b and keep the designation  for the formerly described first exon . these exons were also confirmed by 5'rapid amplification of cdna ends  using a gene specific reverse primer in exon  <dig> and sequences were deposited in the ncbi database . the short alternative 5'utr has also been found in a systematic approach characterizing transcripts, which contain alternative promoter regions .

rt-pcr using sense as well as antisense primers located in exon  <dig> in combinations with the respective forward and reverse primers in exon 1a and 1b did not detect an amplicon containing exon 1c together with the novel exons in cdna derived from human monocytes and in cdnas from various organs  . pcr amplification with primers located in exon 1c gave a positive result when using reverse primers in exon  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  the results taken together with other findings that confirm the existence and/or induction of the canonical exon  <dig>  <cit>  point to the usage of two alternative promoters.

distribution and regulation of splice isoforms
to identify expression patterns of the alternative transcript isoforms, we analyzed expression in adult human tissues by rt-pcr methods using primers spanning exon1a to  <dig>  the identity of the resulting amplicons was confirmed by dna sequencing . the rt-pcr analysis showed that the mrna for the alternative nod <dig> isoforms are abundantly expressed in the small intestine, colon, prostate, lung and in liver. interestingly, the ratio between the long and the short isoform varied considerably, e.g. peripheral blood leukocytes showed a striking preponderance of the short exon 1a/ <dig> isoform .

to analyze whether the ratio of the different utr mrna isoforms of nod <dig> is regulated by cytokine stimulation, primary human monocytes were purified and stimulated for  <dig> h with tnf-α . transcripts encoding novel isoforms of nod <dig> were amplified as outlined and analyzed on an agarose gel . here, the stimulation of resting monocytes led to a decrease of the long  isoform to nearly undetectable levels, whereas the levels of transcripts encoding the alternative short form were increased. the transcript ratio of the utr isoforms of nod <dig> upon stimulation was further analyzed by cloning and counting of pcr products  as previously described  <cit> . the percentage of clones containing the short form of the utr was similarly increased upon tnf-α stimulation .

a pronounced increase of the short utr isoform was detectable in inflamed colonic and ileal biopsy specimen from patients with crohn disease. using a densitometric analysis of agarose gels of colonic samples, the short form  was significantly overrepresented in inflamed cd biopsies, whereas in control subjects, which underwent colonoscopy for routine cancer surveillance, four to five times more of the long isoform  was detected . in contrast, in non-inflamed biopsies from healthy controls higher levels of the short form  were observed than in the non-inflamed colonic samples. however, in inflamed ileal biopsies of crohn disease patients only the short form  was detectable .

upstream atgs in exon 1b inhibit translation efficiency
sequence inspection suggested that the nod <dig> mrna isoform with exon1a being joined directly to exon  <dig>  allows translation from the very first atg localized in exon  <dig>  the longer isoform  appeared to exhibit structural features which may interfere with efficient translation. exon 1b contains three additional upstream atgs , the first two being in the same phase with a stop codon and the subsequent card <dig> start, while the third one begins a new upstream orf  in a different reading frame. no significant similarity to other known proteins was found in the  <dig> amino acid peptide  resulting from the first uorf in the non-redundant  sequence database using blastp and blastx algorithms. the second uorf encodes a six amino acid  peptide, the third start methionie results in an uorf of  <dig> amino acids . uatgs and short uorfs are considered as regulatory elements for expression control on the level of translation. we inserted the utrs upstream of the exon  <dig> atg of the two newly identified splice forms into a reporter gene vector in order to monitor differential translation efficiency by dual luciferase assays . hek  <dig> cells and hl- <dig> monocytic cells  transfected with the short form  exhibit up to 4-fold higher luciferase activities than cells transfected with the vector containing the longer isoform . using sequential deletion constructs of the three uatgs  generated by site-directed mutagenesis we could demonstrate that the translation effiency from the same construct was significantly increased when the uorfs were removed . similarly, treatment of alt 5'utr nod <dig> b-luc transfected cells with the mtor inhibitor rapamycin led to an increase of luciferase activity  suggesting a role for an mtor mediated modulation of the translation initiation factors eif <dig> α and eif4e in the control of the uorf-mediated translational repression of nod <dig> as reported for other uorf-containing utrs  <cit> .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the salient finding of the present study is the demonstration of two novel exons  in the nod2/card <dig> gene, which appear to contribute to the tight regulation of nod <dig> protein levels in the physiological setting. expression of transcripts containing exon1a and 1b is driven by an alternative promoter located within a cpg island, whereas transcripts containing the canonical exon  <dig> are regulated by an nf-κb-dependent promoter. evidence is increasing that the 5'-utr of eukaryotic mrna pivotally contributes to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression  <cit> . aug codons  upstream of the main open reading frame or short upstream orfs are present in approx. 10% of all mrnas  <cit> . although the functional impact of this mechanism has not been investigated on a genome-wide level, recent studies on selected utrs containing uaugs or uorfs suggest an important role in negative translational control across kingdoms from plants to mammals  <cit> . within the exon 1b of the alternative 5'-utr region of human nod <dig>  three uorfs with variable lengths were identified upstream of the main orf located in exon  <dig>  these uorfs exert a negative influence on translational efficacy as shown by luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the uaugs. the effect was rapamycin-sensitive pointing to a role of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eif2α and eif4e, which were shown to be decisive factors for regulated initiation of translation of a subset of mrnas that have cis-regulatory small upstream open reading frames  <cit> . although a tendency towards higher luciferase expression was observed for the reporter construct representing the short novel isoform after stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α, further investigations are warranted to identify signaling pathways involved in adjusting the activity of elfs in acute and chronic inflammation.

we demonstrate for the first time that context-dependent alternative splicing is linked to uorf-mediated translational repression. this additional regulatory mechanism may to contribute to the overall control of nod <dig> protein level in inflammation. we show that stimulation of monocytic cells with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α shifts the ratio of the splice isoforms towards the shorter isoform that lacks exon1b containing the regulatory uorfs. similarly, in the inflamed colonic tissue of crohn disease patients, a preponderance of the short alternative 5'utr transcript isoform could be detected, which may result in higher protein levels in the absence of uorfs. the three main variants in nod <dig>  are genetically associated with a distinct subphenotype of cd involving the small intestine   <cit> . high constitutive expression of nod <dig> has been shown in paneth cells  <cit> , which represent specialized iecs secreting antimicrobial peptides in the terminal ileum. a genetic ablation of nod <dig> in mice leads to a distinct defect in cryptdin  expression in the ileum  <cit> . consistently, a nod2-genotype dependent impairment of human α-defensin - <dig> and - <dig> has been shown in ileal cd <cit> , which may pivotally contribute to the immunological barrier dysfunction observed in cd etiopathogenesis  <cit> . interestingly, in biopsies from the ileum we observed a higher constitutive representatation of the short  isoform. in the inflamed ileum only the exon1a/ <dig> form was detectable. we thus hypothesize that alternative splicing of the two novel isoforms contributes to the upregulation of nod <dig> protein levels observed under inflammatory conditions and the high constitutive expression in distinct cell types, i.e. monocytic cells and, possibly, paneth cells. interestingly, stimulation of monocytes with tnf-α results in a downregulation of a short alternatively spliced isoform of nod <dig> encoding an auto-inhibitory card-only protein, which is generated by skipping of exon  <dig>  <cit> . albeit reciprocal mechanisms involved , these complex changes in splice patterns of nod <dig> transcripts after tnf-α stimulation all result in a higher sensitivity of the cellular nod <dig> sensor function.

an obvious paradoxon is created by the fact that "loss-of function" variants in nod <dig> have been genetically associated with a higher risk for the development of crohn disease, whereas higher levels of nod <dig> protein have been detected by several groups independent from the respective nod <dig> genotype. however, it is generally accepted that up-regulation of nod <dig> expression in intestinal inflammation is a generic response to bacterial invasion and represents a futile attempt to restore the disrupted epithelial barrier in patients with crohn disease. it will be a major goal to dissect the contribution of the differential usage of the two alternative promoters in different cell types and the regulation of the uorf-mediated translational repression to the overall control of nod <dig> protein level. these studies may not only provide deeper insights in the pathophysiology of human inflammatory disorders, but may also help to understand the complex physiological regulation of sensitivity and tolerance of the innate immune system during the life-long interaction with the commensal flora.
