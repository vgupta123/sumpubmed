BACKGROUND
madagascar periwinkle  has become a model plant for secondary metabolism studies
 <cit> . the medicinal plant c. roseus possesses a large number of terpenoid indole alkaloids  among which over  <dig> compounds have been isolated and identified
 <cit> . the production of the most valuable dimeric alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine are extremely low in wild-type c. roseus plant
 <cit> , and hard to be improved using cell suspension and hairy root cultures systems
 <cit> . in addition, it is also difficult to synthesize tias by chemical methods due to their complicated structures
 <cit> . until now, the tias metabolic pathway  of c. roseus has become clearer. vinblastine and vincristine are the most important antitumor bisindole alkaloids, which are derived from the coupling of vindoline and catharanthine monomers. the biochemical synthesis of the six-step enzymatic conversion of tabersonine to vindoline has been studied extensively
 <cit> . the terminal step of vindoline biosynthesis is catalyzed by deacetylvindoline-4-o-acetyltransferase . the recent development of metabolic engineering strategy offers a promising solution to improve the tias production in c. roseus. therefore, the establishment of effective regeneration and transformation system for c. roseus is required.

to date, genetic transformation of c. roseus has been mostly confined to hairy roots and suspension cells. agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation involving productions of hairy  roots in c. roseus had been reported
 <cit> . however, the phenotypes of transgenic c. roseus plants transformed by a. rhizogenes are abnormal, such as shortened internodes, wrinkled leaves and abundant root mass
 <cit> . thus this kind of transgenic c. roseus plants is not suitable for the production of tias. transgenic c. roseus cell suspension cultures transformed by either agrobacterium infection or by particle bombardment had been established and studied intensively
 <cit> . but these transgenic cells lines do not produce alkaloids in a stable manner and their ability to accumulate tias is gradually declined by long-term subculture
 <cit> . recently a. tumefaciens-mediated transformation was employed in c. roseus, the transgenic callus and plants were obtained respectively
 <cit> . however, these transformation systems were not confirmed with other biochemical assays such as southern blot and high performance liquid chromatography . to address these issues, in the present study we developed an a. tumfaciens mediated transformation and regeneration system of c. roseus. the stable regeneration plants were successfully acquired. to demonstrate this transformation system, dat, an essential gene in tias biosynthetic pathway was overexpressed and the accumulation of vindoline was analyzed using hplc in transformants.

RESULTS
optimization of transformation conditions for c. roseus
to develop an efficient system for producing transgenic c. roseus plants using a. tumefaciens, the association parameters were systemically investigated and optimized, including the concentration of agrobacterium and acetosyringone, co-cultivation duration, and sonication condition. the detection was performed using the a. tumefaciens-mediated gus gene transient expression. the transformation frequency was calculated as the number of kanamycin resistance plants/number of explants ×  <dig> 

firstly, we assessed the a. tumefaciens density and duration during infection. the density of a. tumefaciens culture corresponding to od600 =  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were chosen. these a. tumefaciens cultures were re-suspended to od600 =  <dig>  with liquid ms supplied with 100 μm acetosyringone. then the hypocotyls were treated for  <dig>   <dig> and 45 min respectively. the results showed that the highest gus transient expression  and the relatively lower death rate for the explants  were achieved using the od <dig> =  <dig>  of a. tumefaciens and the explants infection of 30 min .

transient expression of gus gene was examined after co-culture. the data of death rates were collected after  <dig> d of co-culture. hypocotyls were placed on mscp <dig> medium.

a transient expression rate = number of gus+ explants/number of explants ×  <dig> 

b death rate = number of died explants/number of explants ×  <dig> 

c values represent means for  <dig> explants per treatment, replicated three times. mean ± se in each column followed by the same letter are not significantly different according to tukey’s multiple comparison test .

secondly, the effects of co-cultivation duration and acetosyringone concentration on transformation frequency were optimized separately. the co-cultivation with a. tumefaciens between  <dig> to  <dig> d and the acetosyringone concentration  on t-dna delivery were tested. the results showed that the highest frequency of gus transient expression  and the relatively lower death rate  were obtained for the explants with  <dig> d co-cultivation and 100 μm of acetosyringone in co-culture medium in dark .

thirdly, the effects of sonication power and time on transformation frequency were investigated. agrobacterium provides one of the main vehicles for introducing foreign dna into plants based on its ti-plasmid. however, one disadvantage of agrobacterium transformation is the host’s specificity, which results in low efficiency in certain species
 <cit> . sonication-assisted agrobacterium-mediated transformation  offers an option to enhance agrobacterium transient or stable transformation efficiency in different plant tissues
 <cit> . the explanation might be the micro wounding formed by sonication on the surface and sub-surface layers of targeted tissue, which secrets more phenolic compounds and enhances the efficiency of transformation
 <cit> . up to now, the saat has been successfully employed to enhance transformation efficiency in several plant species, including kidney bean
 <cit> , radish
 <cit> , flax
 <cit>  and chickpea
 <cit> . however, sonication alone has its negative effects on survival rate of the explants. so in this work the intensity and period of sonication were evaluated in order to seek the optimization of sonication application on c. roseus transformation. before a. tumefaciens infection, c. roseus hypocotyls were transferred into liquid ms medium with 100 μm acetosyringone, and then sonicated with different power  and time , respectively. the results are shown as figure
 <dig>  after  <dig> d co-cultivation, we found that the transient expression of gus stain was enhanced with the increase of sonication time and power . this result indicated that the transient transformation efficiency can be improved with the sonication treatment, which is accord with previous reports
 <cit> . the growth of explants was further observed by transferring them to the mscp <dig> culture medium . the sonication power of 0 ~ 60 w and 0 ~ 15 min had no influence on the survival rate of these explants . however, the survival rate was decreased to 45% when the ultrasound treatment increased to 80 w and 15 min. furthermore, when the sonication power arrived at 100 w, the survival rate of explants was decreased remarkably. altogether, the sonication treatment of 80 w and 10 min can improve the transformation efficiency of c. roseus while keeping relatively high surviving rate .

fourthly, the influence of kanamycin concentration on plant regeneration was assessed. the types of selectable markers and the selection pressure are very important factors for successful transformation
 <cit> . the neomycin phosphotransferase gene which confers on the plant resistance to kanamycin is used in this protocol. selection during callus induction and shoot initiation encourages regeneration of putative transgenic plants
 <cit> . in the present study, three media   supplied with different concentrations of kanamycin  were prepared and used in sequence. considering the growth of plant itself may strengthen resistance to kanamycin, the relatively higher kanamycin concentration was used in the media from mscp <dig> to mscp <dig> 

from figure
3a, the regeneration frequency of transformed and non-transformed explants was declined with the increase of kanamycin concentration. with the kanamycin concentration of 40 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 50 mg/l in mscp <dig> , the differentiation of non-transformed explants was inhibited comparing to transformed explants. but the regeneration frequency of non-transformed explants is still from 13% to 23%. when the kanamycin concentration higher than 70 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 90 mg/l in mscp <dig> , the regeneration of non-transformed explants was almost completed inhibited. the representative images are shown as in figure
3b, which exhibit the contrast of growth state between non-transformed and transformed explants. at last, 40 mg/l in mscp <dig>  70 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 90 mg/l in mscp <dig> kanamycin  were used for selecting transformed plants due to the relatively high regeneration efficiency of transformed explants  and low regeneration efficiency of non-transformed explants .

regeneration of transgenic c. roseus
using hypocotyls as explants, callus induction, shoot initiation and root initiation media containing kanamycin were employed in sequence. after agrobacterium-mediated transformation and  <dig> d co-cultivation in dark, transgenic calli were induced by growing the hypocotyl explants for  <dig> d in selective medium  with kanamycin. then the induced transgenic calli were subjected to additional two rounds of selection on medium  containing higher levels of kanamycin , which helps to eliminate false-positive plants. in this experiment, we found most explants became brown gradually and died except the putative transformants. the green shoots of putative transformants that appeared in  <dig> d  were transferred onto roots induction medium . at last, the rooted plants grew normally after transplanted to soil in the green house . it took 3 ~ 4 months using hypocotyls as starting materials from inoculation with a. tumefaciens to transplant to soil. the procedures of c. roseus transformation were showed in figure
 <dig> 

molecular characterization of transgenic c. roseus plants with gus
to confirm the transformation events, histochemical analysis of gus activity was carried out in putative kanamycin resistant transgenic lines. gus positive blue coloration was visibly detected in all transgenic tissues stained with x-gluc reagent . however the gus staining was not detected in the wild type plants which were neither sonicated nor transformed with agrobacterium .

to determine the presence and the integration of transgene in kanamycin resistant plants, pcr and dna blot hybridization were performed with genomic dna. first the putative transgenic plants were screened by pcr using gus gene-specific primers to detect the presence of target gene in host. the representative results are shown as in figure
6e. it indicates the 400 bp fragments of gus genes in kanamycin-resistant transformed plants were amplified, which is the same as positive control. no specific amplification product was detected in non-transgenic control plants.

the transgenic plant integrated with foreign gene was further verified by southern blot with the fragment of gus as probe. the genomic dna was obtained from two independent pcr-positive and gus-positive transgenic c. roseus plants. the southern results indicate that the t-dna was inserted into genome of both transgenic plants. one transgenic plant has a single copy and another has two copies, while no signal is detected in the untransformed control .

altogether, the results of molecular analyses confirm that these regenerated plants are stably integrated with gus gene. in this study we obtained  <dig> putatively transformed plants by transformed the explants three times using same method. the percentage of explants producing regenerates was 19% and the frequency of explants producing independent transgenic plants was established at 11%.

analysis of transgenic c. roseus plants with overexpressed dat
in order to validate the established transformation system, the dat was over expressed in catharanthus plants using the same transformation procedure.  <dig> independent transgenic plants were confirmed by southern blot and/or pcr analyses . with the fragment of dat as probe, the result of southern blot  show that the transformants contained  <dig> to  <dig> more copies of dat gene than the negative control.

the dat mrna level was analyzed using real-time pcr in  <dig> independently dat transformed c. roseus plants. the results reveal that the expression level of dat was increased in all the transgenic plants . especially for d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> transgenic plants, the expression of dat was significantly increased by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold respectively.

at last, the yield of vindoline was determined by hplc in dat overexpressed transgenic plants. the pcambia <dig> transgenic and wild type plants were served as negative controls. with dat overexpression, the results show that the production of vindoline was increased in all transformants . the amount of vindoline was  <dig>  ~  <dig>  μg/mg  in transgenic plants with over-expressed dat, and about  <dig>  μg/mg  in both pcambia <dig> and wild-type plants. especially for the d <dig>  the accumulated vindoline was  <dig>  μg/mg ,  <dig> -folds than that of controls. this finding is consistent with the real-time pcr results, which suggests that dat expression is associated with the accumulation of vindoline. however, further investigations will be needed involving more number of transformed plants to decipher the precise role of dat genes in the regulation of tias pathway in c. roseus.

because the transformation of c. roseus at whole plant level had no report before, the functions of genes in tias were investigated using hair root or suspension cell transformation so far. here the established transformation system provides a potential possibility to investigate the effect of gene expression upon the alkaloids yields on c. roseus whole plant, and would contribute to the successful modification of the medicinal plants for higher natural product yields.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report an agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regeneration system for c. roseus. the parameters influencing the transformation frequency are systematically investigated, including the concentration of agrobacterium and acetosyringone, co-cultivation duration, sonication condition and selection pressure of kanamycin. the results show that the transformation frequency arrived at 11%. in order to validate the established transformation system, the key gene, dat, in tias biosynthetic pathway was overexpressed. the hplc results reveal that the production of vindoline was enhanced in transgenic plants with dat overexpression.

in conclusion, all the results obtained show that the c. roseus transformation protocols developed in this work has great potential to be used in the discovery of genes function in tias biosynthetic pathway, in addition to improve the productions of tias.
