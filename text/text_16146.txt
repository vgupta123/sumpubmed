BACKGROUND
the genus mycobacterium includes species found in a wide range of ecological niches. m. tuberculosis, m. leprae, and m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, are pathogenic species causing clinical disease in humans or animals. other species as m. smegmatis and m. phlei are saprophytes. in addition, an intermediate position is occupied by species opportunistic pathogens such as m. fortuitum, a rapidly growing mycobacteria that is ubiquitous in soil and water. this mycobacteria is known to cause cutaneous infection, typically in association with trauma or clinical procedures  <cit> . due to its capacity to growth and to survive intracellularly, m. fortuitum has been previously used as a model for studying the intracellular killing of mycobacteria  <cit> .

most bacteria, when exposed to toxic oxygen metabolites, exhibit an adaptive response and express several genes involved in detoxification of oxygen reactive species, such as superoxide dismutases , catalases and peroxidases  <cit> . this type of adaptative response has been implicated in the intracellular survival of pathogenic mycobacteria, promoting their maintenance in the host  <cit> .

the major pathogen, m. tuberculosis, produces an iron co-factored sod encoded by the gene soda  <cit>  and a copper and zinc sod encoded by the gene sodc  <cit>  whose involvement in protection against oxidative stress of m. tuberculosis within macrophages is currently controversial  <cit> . sod encoded by soda is a major secreted protein  <cit>  that inhibits host responses to m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the expression of genes soda and sodc is considered constitutive and inducible respectively  <cit> . homologues of these genes have been detected in several mycobacterial species, including m. fortuitum  <cit> .

there are two classes of catalases identified in mycobacteria: the heat-labile catalase or t-catalase , which has also a peroxidase-like function, and the heat-stable catalase or m-catalase . the catalase codified by katg is synthesized preferentially in response to oxidative stress whereas the catalase codified by kate is produced in response to nutrient depletion as occurs in the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . m. fortuitum produces both catalases however m. tuberculosis produces only t-catalase whilst m. terrae only produces m-catalase  <cit> . the katg gene has been widely studied in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the katg protein contributes to the ability of m. tuberculosis to grow and survive within the infected host tissues  <cit>  and is involved in the resistance of m. tuberculosis to the first-line antimicrobial drug isoniazid  <cit> . due to their involvement in disease pathogenesis, both soda and katg genes are considered virulence factors of m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

the oxidative stress response in bacteria is linked to the iron metabolic pathway  <cit> . one of the proteins involved in that link is the ferric uptake regulator protein  an homologue of the fur of e. coli, encoded by the fura gene  <cit> . the fura gene is located immediately upstream of the katg gene in m tuberculosis, an arrangement that appears to be common amongst mycobacterial genomes  <cit> .

only few studies have investigated the regulation of expression of detoxifying genes in mycobacteria. two promoters have been detected that control katg expression in m. tuberculosis, one is located upstream of the fura gene and is co-transcribed with katg  <cit> . moreover, fura represses katg gene expression in m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis  <cit>  and autoregulates its own expression by binding to the fur-a box, a  <dig> bp at-rich sequence located upstream of fura gene, which is overlapping the - <dig> and - <dig> region of the corresponding promoter  <cit> . no studies have yet been published on the regulation of mycobacterial sod genes.

the genes soda and katg have been previously studied by our group in m. fortuitum  <cit> . we have shown that protein soda of m. fortuitum requires manganese as cofactor  <cit> . this mycobacteria has two genes encoding for two different enzymes with catalase-peroxidase activities, called katgi and katgii . katgii is more related to the single m. tuberculosis katg than katgi  <cit> . upstream of both genes we have also found copies of the furai and furaii genes respectively . the furaii-katgii spacer region spans only  <dig> nucleotides in the genome of m. fortuitum, thus suggesting that the two genes might be co-transcribed.

in this work we have further analyzed the transcriptional activity of katgii, furaii and soda genes in m. fortuitum under oxidative stress. putative promoters have been identified, and real-time quantitative pcr  applied to the transcriptional analysis of cultures, which have been exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

qrt-pcr technology has been widely used in the analysis of gene transcriptional activity due to its high efficiency, level of sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . quantitative gene-expression assays using this technique are typically referenced to an internal control to account for differences in the rna load. the conditions of the experimental design should not influence the detection level of the selected internal control. thus the validation of reference controls is recommended in any such experimentation  <cit> .

two different products siga  <cit>  and rrs   <cit> , have most often been used as reference standards in qrt-pcr assays involving mycobacteria. however both of these have disadvantages. siga expression has been found to decrease threefold during entry of bacterial growth into the stationary phase  <cit> . levels of rrs usually do not change during most phases of bacterial growth, however it is present in a much higher amounts than any mrna in the cell  probably because of its higher stability as part of the ribosomes, compared to the stability of other rna molecules in the cytoplasm, which can cause problems with sensitivity.

recently, our laboratory described  <cit>  a putative new reference product  suitable for qrt-pcr. here we demonstrate the usefulness of this promoter as reference in the qrt-pcr analysis of cultures of m. fortuitum during oxidative stress. this methodology may be applied to other quantitative gene-expression analysis of mycobacteria and other bacterial genera in order to evaluate the influence of any experimental treatment on the transcriptional level of gene expression.

RESULTS
enzymatic activity upon oxidative stress of katg and soda proteins
the enzymatic activities of catalase-peroxidase and superoxide dismutase proteins were examined in the extracts collected from m. fortuitum cultures . the results  indicated a low level of activity of the katgi under each of the test conditions. further analysis of the mrna levels for katgi  was unsuccessful, probably due to the scarce expression level of that gene under the experimental conditions applied. the activity of katgii remains similar from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes under  <dig>  and  <dig> mm of h2o <dig> . katgii showed its lowest activity relative to the control at  <dig> min of treatment with  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide. at this highest concentration, the catalase-peroxidase activity of katgii increased from cultures treated during  <dig> min to cultures treated during  <dig> min . see additional file  <dig> for densitometry values.

the soda enzymatic activity did not show detectable variation with the control comparing different extracts under all the conditions tested . this result is in agreement with the considered constitutive expression of the soda gene  <cit> .

identification of the transcriptional start points  of the genes under study
we detected two putative transcriptional start points  in each the three genes examined by rna protection assay  . putative - <dig> and - <dig> boxes were identified according the consensus mycobacterial promoters previously described in the literature  <cit> . the presence of furaii-katgii co-transcripts was tested by standard rt-pcr. co-transcripts furaii-katgii were detected in all the stress conditions tested . these results are in agreement to those described previously in m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

validation of rrna-p <dig> as reference product in qrt-pcr under stress conditions
the rrna-p <dig> promoter-usage of m. fortuitum cultures treated with hydrogen peroxide was analyzed by primer extension   <cit> . the relative activities of the five rrn promoters of m. fortuitum, corresponding to different pe products, were determined by quantification of the radioactive levels for each of the conditions tested .

all the promoters were differentially expressed under each of the conditions tested with the exception of the rrna-p <dig> promoter whose contribution to the pre-rrna synthesis was less than 1%, and evenly maintained in each of the stress conditions tested . these results suggested the suitability of the rrna-p <dig> promoter as reference standard in qrt-pcr analysis of m. fortuitum under oxidative stress.

experiments were conducted to validate the usefulness of rrna-p <dig> product as a reference in qrt-pcr, when m. fortuitum cultures were grown under oxidative stress. validation of the rrna-p <dig> promoter as a constitutive product was investigated using the derivation of the 2-ΔΔct equation as indicated in methods: 2-Δct . in this equation the control corresponded to the untreated culture, and the sample corresponded to each stress culture condition. the results are showed in the figure 2b. no significant differences were found comparing data from all the culture conditions tested with the control . this result validates the product corresponding to rrna-p <dig> promoter as a reference in the analysis undertaken.

analysis of the m. fortuitum gene expression upon oxidative stress
the transcription of katgii and soda in m. fortuitum during the oxidative stress response was initially analyzed using northern blot assay . the transcripts were detected by hybridization with internal probes corresponding to each of the genes. an internal probe of the rrs gene was also used to test the relative amount of rna fixed on the filter . a single band was detected per each probe at the expected sizes:  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig> bp for rrs, katgii, and soda respectively .

the amounts of radioactive signals corresponding to katgii, and soda genes in each lane were also quantified and normalized with the amount of radioactivity obtained using the rrs as a probe . no significant changes were obtained in the level of mrna corresponding to either of the genes under stress conditions, with the exception of mrna of the katgii gene which increased  <dig> fold after  <dig> min of treatment at  <dig> mm h2o2; and the mrna of the soda gene which increased two fold after  <dig> and  <dig> min of treatment at the same h2o <dig> concentration .

in order to determine more accurately the amount of the transcripts of m. fortuitum in response to oxidative stress, qrt-pcr technique was applied to quantify the mrnas. the transcription of soda, katgii and its putative regulator furaii were analyzed . the genes under study did not show main variations in the quantity of products in relation to the different h2o <dig> concentrations applied, as well as in relation to the duration of the treatment. again, the only significant change was detected at the highest concentration tested . at this concentration, the highest level of katgii, furaii and soda expressions corresponded to the culture treated with h2o <dig> during  <dig> min. compared to the control culture, katgii and furaii mrna levels product increased in this point more than twenty and fifteen fold respectively. the products corresponding to soda suffered a three-fold increase in this same point of analysis .

under other h2o <dig> concentrations tested  the mrna levels of katgii, furaii and soda either increased to a lesser extent or remain unchanged with the duration of the treatment .

viability of m. fortuitum under different h2o <dig> stress treatment
to analyse the influence of the stress on the viability of the m. fortuitum, we determined the colony forming units  of each of the cultures . no main differences were found when controls and test cultures were compared, indicating that changes detected at the mrna and proteins levels were not related to changes in the bacterial viability.

discussion
mycobacteria are ubiquitous bacteria and are therefore exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions, including animals and humans. one of these conditions is the host stress response which includes induction of reactive oxygen intermediates  against which mycobacteria synthesize enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases and peroxidases. this work studies these enzymatic responses in the opportunistic pathogen m. fortuitum growing in the presence of hydrogen peroxide measured using real-time pcr to quantify mrna specific products corresponding to genes soda, katgii and furaii involved in the oxidative stress response.

the development of a reliable qrt-pcr method requires corrections for experimental sample variations, such as reverse transcription efficiency. those variations are best controlled by the inclusion of an internal reference standard. ideally this reference standard should have a constant expression under each of the experimental conditions  <cit> . moreover, validation of the internal control is recommended when designing quantitative gene expression studies  <cit> .

we have previously reported that the first promoter of the rrna operon  gave better results in m. fortuitum  <cit>  than siga and 16s rrna, the standards more frequently used in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . this study has tested this product for suitability as reference standard in the study of the oxidative stress response of m. fortuitum.

the primer extension results showed that the product of the rrna-p <dig> promoter was synthesized at a low and constant level when m. fortuitum cultures were placed under oxidative stress . experiments conducted to validate rrna-p <dig> as reference standard in qrt-pcr  found no statistically significant changes , in expression levels during several of the experimental conditions. it was concluded therefore that rrna-p <dig> is a suitable reference standard for qrt-pcr studies of m. fortuitum growing under oxidative stress.

in contrast to the single promoter previously detected upstream of fura and katg genes of m. tuberculosis  <cit> , two promoters were identified in the m. fortuitum genome upstream of furaii, katgii and soda . furaii and katgii genes were co-transcribed in m. fortuitum in a similar manner to m. tuberculosis  <cit> , showing the previously described conserved organization of those genes among mycobacteria  <cit> . recently, it has been demonstrated in m. smegmatis that the single transcript containing fura and katg is processed to originate two different transcripts, one covering fura and the second covering katg  <cit> , that result explain why fura-katg co-transcripts were not detected in this species previously  <cit> . nevertheless the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in m. fortuitum cannot be excluded, differently to m. smegmatis, furaii-katgii co-transcripts were detected in m. fortuitum supporting that a different transcriptional organization could occurs in this last mycobacteria.

several genomes of mycobacterial species have been sequenced or are in progress  <cit> , including that of the rapidly growing mycobacteria m. smegmatis . this strain is used frequently in the study of mycobacteria, because of its rapid growth, and low biosafety requirements. a search of the m. smegmatis genomeidentified three putative katg genes. two of these are associated with a corresponding fura gene immediately upstream, including a fur-a box in one of them. also of note is that the third katg gene has a long deletion in its 5' end , which could explain the lack of the sequence corresponding to a paired fura gene upstream.

studies in m. tuberculosis have clearly established that fur-a is a negative regulator of the katg expression in mycobacteria  <cit> ; this regulation is mediated by the fura-box identified upstream of the fura gene in the region corresponding to the - <dig> promoter sequence, also known as the at-rich sequence. the linkage of fura to the fura-box is inhibited in the presence of hydrogen peroxide thus allowing the transcription of the downstream genes. sala et al.  <cit>  have analyzed the fura box of m. smegmatis, which presumably included the single fura-katg copy associated with this regulatory sequence. in this work we identify that at-rich sequence  <dig> nucleotides upstream the furaii start codon of m. fortuitum . this sequence includes the - <dig> box corresponding to the p <dig> promoter identified . similarly to m. smegmatis, only one of the two fura-katg tandem genes of m. fortuitum has a sequence equivalent to the fura box upstream.

by using qrt-pcr, we observed that the influence of hydrogen peroxide in the level of expression of katgii and furaii of m. fortuitum differs from other mycobacteria  <cit>  by not showing variation in the protein and mrna levels of these genes when m. fortuitum was treated with up to  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide . these results could indicate that m. fortuitum appears to be more resistant to the hydrogen peroxide stress than other mycobacterial species.

we did find significant changes however in the stress response in cultures of m. fortuitum when treated with  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  under such conditions, the mrna levels of the two genes  increased significantly, and the level of soda mrna rose to its higher level after  <dig> minutes of treatment . considering also that only a low level of mrna could be detected when cultures were treated with  <dig> mm of h2o <dig> during  <dig> and  <dig> minutes , we hypothesized that  <dig> mm h2o <dig> may be deleterious for the bacteria, however m. fortuitum cultures studied under stress found no decrease in cfu under each of the conditions tested . we conclude therefore that the changes detected in genes related to the stress response  are not associated to changes in the viability of the bacteria, however they could indicate a compensatory reaction, at the transcriptional level, to the decrease detected at the protein level  indicating some adaptative response of the transcriptional machinery to that extremely adverse environmental conditions. further studies are required to determine if the response to  <dig> mm h2o <dig> might indicate a global alteration in the transcriptional activity or possibly post-transcriptional regulation of m. fortuitum.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that mycobacteria differ in their response against oxidative stress. the opportunistic pathogen m. fortuitum is more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than the main pathogen m. tuberculosis and the saprophyte m. smegmatis. even though changes in the mrna and proteins related to oxidative stress were detected, the m. fortuitum viability was not affected at a h2o <dig> treatment as strong as  <dig> mm during  <dig> minutes.

this work also demonstrated the suitability of the non-coding region  as reference standard in the quantification of the transcriptional activity of genes associated to oxidative stress in m. fortuitum. the reference product applied  is related to the ribosomal rna, a bacterial component frequently used as reference in the analysis of the bacterial transcriptional activity.
