BACKGROUND
stroke and seizures-induced neurodegeneration share a number of biological processes, including increased neuronal activity, neuronal plasticity, inflammation, and apoptosis  <cit> . separation of effects of these processes on gene expression, identification of participating transcription factors, and comparison of transcriptional regulation between the two pathological conditions remain a challenging task. global gene expression following stroke and seizures were compared before at a single time-point  <cit> , but no comparison of time-series gene profiling datasets from the two conditions was reported to date.

alter et al. first introduced a concept that orthogonal components  resulting from the singular value decomposition  of time-series gene expression dataset  <cit>  may help to separate concurrent effects of different processes and regulators on gene expression. these authors proposed that an eigen array may reflect a genome-wide input from a particular regulator, with the corresponding eigen gene reflecting this regulator's activity across the samples . for an illustration of the svd nomenclature, when applied to gene expression - see additional file  <dig> 

a number of recent studies concentrated on usefulness of eigengenes  <cit> , whereas the properties and interpretation of eigenarrays remained relatively less explored. we previously suggested that conservation of eigenarrays between related biological systems may identify eigensystems of biological origin  <cit> . in the same work, utilizing a comparative svd approach we identified an eigensystem conserved between hippocampal development and differentiation of hippocampal neurons in vitro. analysis of cis-regulation of that eigensystem revealed that it reflected exit of neural precursors from the cell cycle and beginning of neuronal differentiation, regulated by transcription factors e2f <dig> and nr2f <dig>  <cit> .

bayesian networks  learning approach is a well-established method of modelling gene regulation and interactions between gene regulatory motifs, starting from gene expression data  <cit>  or gene expression and genomic sequence data  <cit> . the use of linear regression in analysis of gene cis-regulation is grounded in the linear response model of gene regulation  <cit> .

here, we report a time-series dataset from gene expression profiling in the rat mcao model of stroke, and compare these data to the published time-series dataset from the kainate-induced seizures model  <cit> . by comparative svd approach, followed by bayesian network analysis of cis-regulation, we identified two conserved eigensystems separating the effects of different well-defined biological processes on gene expression and regulated by distinct sets of transcription factor binding sites. the results obtained on either dataset were validated on the other.

RESULTS
experimental data and analysis setup
we compared two time-series gene expression datasets from experimental rat models of stroke and epilepsy, which were the transient middle-cerebral artery occlusion  and the kainate-induced seizures, respectively. the mcao dataset was generated in our laboratory and probed gene expression in the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere at four time-points  following a  <dig> minutes occlusion of the right middle-cerebral artery in adult anesthetized rats, and included sham-operated animals as controls. the kainate dataset, published by koh and co-workers  <cit>  probed gene expression in the hippocampus of adult rats at five time-points  following the injection of kainate - a neurotransmitter analogue inducing seizures, which can last for several hours, followed by a seizure-free latent period.

as immobilization of a conscious animal and injection alters gene expression in the brain, this dataset included a control time-series following the injection of saline.

the overall design of our study is illustrated in figure  <dig>  we transform each dataset  separately by svd  and identify eigenarrays conserved between the two systems . this is followed by analysis of biological function using gene ontology , and gene cis-regulation using bayesian networks  and our tram database of putative regulatory regions and motifs. these analyses are performed separately for either dataset and then the results for the corresponding eigensystems are compared  or statistically cross-validated  on the other dataset. the cross-validation between the stroke and seizures data is not contradictory with the goal of gaining information by comparison of the two, because the two experimental models can be assumed - on biological grounds - to share some, but not all, regulatory mechanisms. note that features specific for one model can be identified, as for each model we separately account for the multiplicity of testing.

distinct eigengenes following stroke and seizures
the global temporal changes in gene expression following mcao in the stroke model are dominated by the top three eigensystems . the eigengene of the first eigensystem in the mcao dataset  is constant in time  in the log-expression space and thus represents the average level of expression across all the conditions. the second eigengene  represents an increased expression, as compared to control value, at 12- <dig> h following mcao, with a peak at  <dig> h . the third eigengene  represents a complex pattern with an increase in gene expression at  <dig> h followed by down-regulation of expression at  <dig> h and further drop at  <dig> h . notably, the three top eigengenes indicate no changes in gene expression at  <dig> h after mcao, which is in agreement with our earlier pcr results showing no changes in mrna levels of a smaller number of genes  <cit> .

the global temporal pattern of gene expression following kainate-induced seizures in adult rats is dominated by the top three eigensystems , of which the first again represents the magnitude . the second eigengene , represents an increased expression following the injection of kainate; starting at  <dig> h, largest at  <dig> and  <dig> h, returning to the baseline level at  <dig> and  <dig> h; and no change at any time-point after the injection of saline . the third eigengene  represents an increased expression at  <dig> and  <dig> h after the injection of kainite; followed by strong decrease in expression at  <dig> h, continuing, but less pronounced, also at the  <dig> and  <dig> h .

despite their overall similarity, the corresponding eigengenes are distinct between the two experimental models. in particular, eigengenes m <dig> and m <dig> show no change in expression at  <dig> h following the mcao, in contrast to eigengenes a <dig> and a <dig>  showing an increase at  <dig> h following the injection of kainate.

conserved eigenarrays following stroke and seizures
the kainate datasets comprised of expression profiles for  <dig> genes  that significantly changed expression and the stroke dataset consisted of  <dig> such genes, with  <dig> genes common between the two datasets. the correlation analysis revealed that the top three eigenarrays  were highly correlated . the correlations between the respective first, second, and third eigenarrays were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. note that the correspondence between the three conserved eigenarrays was one-to-one. given the length  of the correlated vectors, these correlations are highly significant . this indicates that the top three eigenarrays are highly conserved between the two datasets. figure 2h-i shows directly genes' loadings of the respective second  or third  eigensystem in the two datasets, sorted on their average loading in both datasets. this sorting of the genes aids visualization of the eigenarrays conservation, but is not in any way a reason for it, as the correlations shown in figure 2g were computed before the sorting . the tangent-like shape of the plots reflects the bell shape of the distributions of genes' loadings of eigensystems  <dig> and  <dig> 

further, we focus on eigensystems  <dig> and  <dig> characterized by conservation of their eigenarrays occurring despite differences between the corresponding eigengenes . this suggests that the two eigensystems reflect regulatory inputs operating in both systems, but with different kinetics and relative strengths.

separation of effects of biological processes on gene expression
a universal reason underlying co-regulation of genes is participation of their products in a common biological process. to assess if the contribution of the eigensystems  <dig> and  <dig> to the gene expression profiles is associated with biological functions, we analyzed the gene ontology "biological process" annotations of all genes in either dataset, ranked on the loadings of the respective eigensystems 2- <dig> 

in both experimental models, the positive loading of the second eigensystem was significantly associated with overlapping go terms describing the inflammatory response to the brain injury . additionally, in the mcao system the positive loading of eigensystem m <dig> was also significantly associated with go terms describing programmed cell death .

in the kainate system, the positive loading of eigensystem a <dig> was highly significantly associated with several overlapping go terms describing neuronal activity, such as: synaptic transmission, transmission of the nerve impulse . no such association was detected for third eigensystem  from the svd on the mcao dataset, following its initial filtering . however, when the go analysis was repeated for the third eigenarray in the svd result on the mcao dataset filtered at anova p-value <  <dig>  and thus containing more genes, there was a clear association between the loadings of the third eigensystem and go terms describing neuronal activity . loosening of the p-value threshold was possible, because the top three eigensystems were extremely robust to the change of the p-value threshold, with eigenarrays correlations >  <dig>  between vectors of length  <dig> for the change of the threshold from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . comparison of the singular values  indicates that the relative contribution of the conserved third eigensystem  was higher in the kainate system, while the relative contribution of the conserved second eigensystem  was higher in the stroke.

bayesian networks analysis of cis-regulation of the conserved eigensystems
conservation of eigenarrays suggests that they reflect regulatory mechanisms, possibly operating at the level of transcription regulation. to identify such mechanisms, we employed bayesian networks, previously successfully applied to modelling transcriptional regulation  <cit> . we follow the above approaches in general, but several essentials are specific to our methodology:

• regulation of gene expression is analysed separately for each conserved eigensystem. in the subspace of a given eigensystem gene expression is binarized into up- and down-regulation, according to the sign of its loading. .

bn learning was performed independently for each of the eigensystems: a <dig>  a <dig>  m <dig>  m3; on the data for all the genes in the respective dataset. eigensystem a <dig> is shown as an example.

• our combinatorial model of cis-regulation takes into account fragmentation of metazoan cis-regulatory regions into multiple conserved non-coding sequences   <cit> , and distinguishes between co-occurrence of several tf-binding motifs in the same cns and their co-occurrence in the same gene . following previous work  <cit> , we term every possible subset of the motifs present in the same cns a composite motif.

• regulatory mechanism is predicted by learning bayesian networks with an exact algorithm. computations are performed by double application of the bnfinder program  <cit> . the first run selects the most promising composite motifs , while the second run selects the sets of such composite motifs that best predict the sign of the loading the chosen eigensystem .

four bn analyses were performed, separately for each conserved eigensystem in either experimental model . bn scores were directly converted to q-values - the false discovery rate  <cit>  analogue of p-values, by comparing each feature's score on the original data to the distribution of scores from  <dig> bn analyses on permuted data - each following an independent random permutation and assignment of expression values to the genes' putative cis-regulatory regions. the conservation of the two eigensystems between the stroke allowed for selection of best features on one dataset  and then testing them on the other - containing the data for largely different genes. the training and testing were performed for the conserved second  and third eigensystem  in both directions. during the test we used the same q-values as during the training, i.e. they were corrected for all the hypotheses ever looked at on the test dataset. we note that this is a very stringent correction, as only up to  <dig> hypotheses were considered for each eigensystem during the test stage .

antagonistic effects of motifs binding ap <dig> and satb on gene expression following the stroke
bn search identified just one feature, namely the motif ap1f - a family of binding sites for the transcription factor ap <dig>  as the feature significantly  associated with the positive sign of eigensystem a <dig> in the kainate model . notably, this feature was significantly associated with the corresponding eigensystem m <dig>  when tested on the dataset from the mcao model . the choice of the mcao data as the training dataset resulted in identification of  <dig> significant features, of which the second was again ap1f, and only this feature was significant also in the cross-system test on the kainate dataset . all remaining features identified as significant  on the training datasets included ap1f as one motif, and two of them were pairs of ap1f with another motif in the same gene. of the features significant in the mcao system, particularly interesting is the pair {ap1f, satb} - a set of two motifs co-occurring in the same gene, which have antagonistic effects on expression in the subspace of eigensystem m <dig>  the presence of motif ap1f in the absence of satb in the same gene was associated with the positive sign of m <dig> loading, while the presence of satb in the absence of ap1f was associated with the negative m <dig> loading .

identification of known and new regulators/targets for the eigensystem reflecting synaptic activity
bn search identified a number of features as highly significantly  associated with the sign of m <dig> loading during the training on the kainate dataset. the ten highest-ranking features, ranked on their bn score were tested on the mcao dataset . of the top ten features significant on the kainate dataset, four were also significant on the mcao dataset. all of these features, marked in bold in figure 5c, were pairs of motifs co-occurring in the same gene. all these pairs contained lhxf as one motif, with egrf, ahrr, zf5f or zbpf as the other motif. the highest-ranking feature - the pair egrf and lhxf in the same gene, but neither motif of its own, was 79% specific for the positive sign of eigensystem  <dig> . when the training was performed on the mcao dataset, several features significantly  associated with the sign of m <dig> were identified . importantly, out of the top ten features identified on the stroke dataset, nine were also significantly associated with the same sign of m <dig> on the kainate dataset. the features significant in the cross-system test were either single motifs  or pairs of motifs in the same gene. all these pairs contained ap1r as one motif, with parf, ahrr, zf5f, egrf, e4ff as the other motif. three motifs, namely egrf, zf5f, ahrr were common between the top ten features identified during training on the kainate and the mcao datasets.

effects of multiplicity of motifs and cnss on gene log-expression
we wanted to check if a model taking into account motif multiplicity would allow a more precise prediction of the value of expression. therefore, we applied a linear regression analysis to the motifs identified by bn analysis as significant in both systems, and additionally the motif satb significant in the mcao system only. for the reasons detailed in the materials and methods, we always performed a weighted linear regression, with the average loadings in groups of genes with the same motif count as the response variable, and the weights set to the numbers of genes in each group, as suggested by faraway  <cit> .

the regression analyses were performed separately for the mcao and the kainate datasets. the linear regression confirmed that the ap1f and satb motifs had antagonistic effects on expression in the subspace of eigensystem m <dig> . the count of motif satb per gene had a clear linear  and highly significant  effect on the group-average expression in the subspace of eigensystem m <dig> . in agreement with the earlier bn result, the count satb had no effect on loading of eigensystem a <dig> . the inhibitory effect of satb on gene expression in the mcao system was specific for eigensystem m <dig>  with no inhibition of expression in the subspace of any other eigensystem .

the count of motif ap1f had a significant, positive and possibly linear effect on the average expression in a subspace of the second eigensystem, both in the mcao  and in the kainate dataset . remarkably, when the effect of ap1f count on m <dig> loading was analyzed separately for the genes with and without motif satb, the effect became more apparent for the genes without motif satb , while the effect was nullified for the genes with the motif satb .

the linear regression revealed that the count of motif creb had a highly significant and approximately linear effect on the average expression in a subspace of the third eigensystem in the kainate  and in the mcao system . the effect of creb sites number on gene expression was specific for the third eigensystem, in particular in the mcao model, where it had no effect on the loadings of the eigensystem m <dig> .

the effects of motif multiplicity on gene expression prompted us to investigate by the linear regression if a related variable - the count of conserved non-coding sequences  per gene had an effect on gene expression. that we found was true in both experimental models . similarly to the effect of creb count, the effect of cns count was highly specific for the third eigensystem . however, when the effect of cns count was analyzed in a bivariate linear regression model, together with that of creb, the effect of the cns was completely  or nearly completely  dependent on the cnss' content of creb-binding motifs .

discussion
here, we demonstrated that eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and synaptic activity on gene expression. the contribution of the eigensystem  <dig> reflecting synaptic activity was relatively greater  in the seizures model, in agreement with higher electrical activity of neurons. remarkably, our analysis of cis-regulation revealed that the these two functionally well-interpretable eigensystems were regulated by distinct sets of transcription factors, with ap <dig> and satb regulating the eigensystem reflecting inflammation/apoptosis, and numerous tfs including creb and egr regulating the eigensystem reflecting neuronal synaptic activity.

activation of transcription factor ap <dig> following the kainate-induced seizures and cerebral ischemia is well established  <cit> . in particular, timp <dig> was shown to be the target of ap <dig> following kainate-induced seizures  <cit> . the mrna profiles of timp <dig> in both systems  are highly similar to the profiles of the respective second eigengenes, which is compatible with our identification of ap <dig> as the key regulator of this eigensystem. it is well established that activation of mapk8-jun/ap <dig> signalling pathway has a predominantly pro-apoptotic effect in neurons  <cit> , however, only few mapk8-ap <dig> targets genes have been identified. therefore, demonstrating the importance of the number of ap1-binding motifs per gene and the simultaneous absence of satb motif for gene activation contributes to identification of ap <dig> target genes.

we report novel and exciting finding that presence of the motif binding satb <dig> prevents - in a motif number dependent manner - transcriptional activation in the stroke system. satb <dig>  which is the best characterized mar-binding protein, has recently emerged as a key factor integrating higher-order chromatin architecture and gene regulation - reviewed in  <cit> . depending on cell type and locus, its effect on chromatin looping may either activate transcription, as described for th <dig> interleukin gene cluster  <cit> , or inhibit transcription, as for the mhc class  <dig> locus  <cit>  and tentatively for our eigensystem m <dig>  a hypothetical mechanism, in which genes in longer chromatin loops, or at the peaks of the loops, are more accessible to binding or activation by ap <dig>  is depicted in figure 6g. proteolytic degradation of satb <dig> occurs during early phases of apoptosis  <cit> . in the current work, the effect of satb motif on expression was limited to the mcao eigensystem  <dig> associated with the apoptosis.

our analysis of cis-regulation of conserved eigensystem  <dig> - reflecting neuronal  activity correctly predicted the known role of creb/atf/e4f <dig> and egr as key regulators of neuronal activity regulated genes, important for neuronal plasticity and memory - for review, see  <cit> . creb motif binds transcription factors of the creb family  <cit> , while e4ff motif binds transcription factors from the atf family. egrf binds transcription factors of the egr family  <cit> . parf binds par/bzip family of tfs . the motifs binding creb, atf and vbp <dig> are similar  and these transcription factors have been shown to bind to overlapping sites  <cit> . a loss of the par/bzip transcription factors results in seizures  <cit> . using classical experimental methods, about a hundred creb target genes have been identified, of which about half encodes neuron-specific proteins - reviewed by lonze & ginty  <cit> . a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation study by impey et al. identified creb binding genes in the neuron-like differentiating rat pheochromocytoma pc <dig> cells  <cit> . when this set of genes was analyzed in our datasets, we found a clear association between creb-binding to the gene and the positive loading of the third eigensystem . thus, the experimental data of impey and co-authors support our in silico results, demonstrating an importance of the presence of creb motif for gene up-regulation in the subspace of eigensystem reflecting neuronal activity.

much experimental evidence supports an important role of egr transcription factors in brain function. transcription factors from the egr family are induced in the rat hippocampus following kainate-induced seizures with kinetics closely resembling eigengene a <dig>  and regulate expression of arc  <cit> , a gene important for neuronal plasticity and memory formation  <cit> . transcriptional activation of egrs was also demonstrated following brain ischemia - reviewed in  <cit> . in addition to creb and egr, our bn analysis identified several novel tentative transcriptional regulators of the eigensystem reflecting synaptic activity .

we demonstrate linear effects of the counts of the motifs satb and creb on log-expression in subspaces of the respective regulated eigensystems following the mcao. these findings are in agreement with the predictions of the linear response model of gene regulation  <cit> . moreover - because this model is valid only for tfs operating within the same cell - the observed agreement is revealing of the underlying biology . first, it suggests that satb and creb operate within the same cells, namely neurons. this prediction is in agreement with our previous experimental data that majority of the cells undergoing apoptosis in the mcao system are neurons  <cit> . second, our results suggest that neuronal apoptosis is triggered by inflammation occurring in other cell types, namely microglia and astrocytes. this could explain why effects of inflammation and apoptosis are reflected by the same eigensystem, uncorrelated to the one reflecting effects of synaptic transmission.

the observed linear effect of cnss' count per gene on log-transformed gene expression, depending on their content of creb, is very interesting in the context of high specificity of this effect  for the conserved eigensystem reflecting neuronal synaptic activity. lee et al.  <cit>  reported relatively greater cumulative length of cnss in the upstream regions of genes involved in development, cell communication, neural functions and signaling processes, and suggested that this may reflect their greater regulatory complexity. we suggest, as another possibility, that neuronal genes need more cnss  to accommodate creb motifs needed for responsiveness to rapidly changing synaptic activity.

our results, demonstrating conservation of eigenarrays of temporal log-expression profiles, between hippocampus following seizures and cortex following the stroke, corroborate and extend recent findings of oldham et al.  <cit> . these authors applied svd to clusters  of expression profiles identified separately for several brain regions, and demonstrated conservation of 'module membership' between the corresponding clusters from different regions. as the 'module membership' is closely related to the first eigenarray of each cluster, their findings imply conservation of the first eigenarrays between the corresponding clusters. our results demonstrate conservation of eigenarrays that occurs genome-wide for three eigensystems, two of which reflect distinct well-defined biological processes and are regulated via different sets of transcription factor binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of different biological processes on gene expression, exerted via distinct sets of transcription factor binding motifs. motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein satb <dig> blocks ap1-driven transcriptional activation. the effects of motifs binding creb and satb <dig> on gene expression conform to the assumptions of the linear response model of gene regulation.
