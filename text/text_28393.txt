BACKGROUND
mobile elements are elements in the genome that can move, either by excision and re-insertion of the dna itself or by insertion of copies made by reverse transcription of an mrna intermediate . the most active in humans are the non-retrovirus-like retrotransposons, the line and sine elements, including respectively l1s and alus. intact, active l1s are transcribed into mrna, which has two open reading frames. the encoded enzyme activities include an endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. the endonuclease cuts the genome at a consensus target site, exposing an end that is used to prime reverse transcription of the l <dig> mrna, and the resulting cdna is integrated . alus and svas do not encode the necessary enzymes and can only be copied when enzymes are provided by an intact l <dig>  <cit> . other mrnas can also be inserted by l <dig> enzymes to give novel processed pseudogenes  <cit> . in humans, a number of l <dig> elements are intact and active, and create novel insertions: in the germline—causing polymorphism and constitutional genetic disease ; in cancers ; and probably also in non-cancerous somatic tissues . although there are limited data so far, there is an expectation that mobile element insertions will contribute to mutation of driver genes in cancers.fig.  <dig> inserts produced by l <dig> activity and how they are treated by paired-end sequencing. a, b generation of inserts showing truncation and transduction . mrna  is transcribed from an l <dig> in the germline . target site is nicked, and the end at the nick used to prime reverse transcription of the mrna to cdna , which is often incomplete . cdna is subsequently integrated, flanked by a short duplication of the target site. some inserts have 5’ inversions, perhaps due to additional priming in the opposite direction  <cit> . a, simple l <dig> insert; b, transduction of 3’ unique sequence. transcription of an l <dig> sometimes reads through the l <dig> polya addition site  into 3’ unique sequence  until a polya addition site  is encountered. the resulting cdna and insert includes a variable amount of the unique sequence and upstream l <dig> sequence. c examples of inserts with transduced unique sequence, and resulting paired-end sequence reads. reverse transcription of the mobile element rna is often incomplete, resulting in 5’ -truncated inserts. these may or may not have any l <dig> sequence, and the most-truncated inserts may contain little more than polya. examples of possible read pairs are shown in black solid lines if the aligner can map  them uniquely to the reference genome; these will usually appear to be translocation junctions . many read pairs will not align  either because one read falls in a repeat, or the sequence is not present in the reference . yellow boxes are target site duplications. d example of an insert of an l <dig> that does not transduce 3’ sequence but nevertheless may be mapped as a translocation junction. the parent l <dig> may have a unique sequence difference, e.g. a single base pair deviation  from the consensus, that identifies reads uniquely and maps them to its parent l <dig>  other reads  are aligned to an l <dig>  in the reference sequence that has a polya tail, e.g. the ‘element’ on chromosome  <dig> in table  <dig>  in some cases the alignment may be generated by the polya alone. such inserts are not in general from the element the read is mapped to. e apparent junction that is not even a junction. occasionally a read pair within an insert may be aligned to two different loci, appearing to report a rearrangement junction. for example, one read may map to a transduced sequence, while its pair contains polya and is mapped to one of the polya runs in the reference genome



two important features of l <dig> retrotransposition are truncation and transduction   <cit> . the inserted copies are often 5’ truncated; and inserts often include sequence from downstream of the l <dig> element proper, because transcription may extend beyond the end of the l <dig> element, to a downstream polya addition signal   <cit> . thus the insert usually consists of polya, with a variable amount of upstream sequence, which may or may not include part of the l <dig> sequence itself   <cit> . the inserts may also be partly inverted, possibly as a result of priming reverse transcription from both directions  <cit> .

paired-end sequencing is currently the method of choice for detecting genome rearrangements in cancer or germline dna  <cit> . typically, sequence reads of 100bp are taken from both ends of genomic dna fragments of 200-500bp. the reads are then aligned to the reference genome, allowing for some variation. rearrangements are detected mainly by looking for ‘discordant read pairs’, i.e. read pairs where the two reads do not map to the same place in the genome at the expected separation, e.g. to different chromosomes. reads that cross rearrangement junctions, ‘split reads’, may also be searched for. thus central to the analysis of the sequencing data is correct interpretation of the alignment of discordant read pairs, or ‘split reads’, to the genome.

the present study is part of a programme to sequence the genomes of  <dig> oesophageal adenocarcinomas  <cit>  within the framework of the international cancer genome consortium.

while analysing genomic rearrangements of these tumours from paired-end sequencing data, we, as others working with other tumour types  <cit> , identified a puzzling class of genome rearrangement. typically, several tumours appeared to have chromosome translocation breakpoints at the same place, to within about a kilobase, apparently translocated to, or inserted into, many places in the genome, in a tumour-specific way, and often with multiple translocations in the same tumour.

we hypothesized that these ‘rearrangements’ were insertions of mobile elements, detected in paired-end sequencing because part of the sequence inserted was unique in the genome.

RESULTS
identification of candidate mobile element transduction events
as others have reported  <cit> , among the rearrangement junctions in our paired-end sequencing were groups of apparent translocations that had highly recurrent breakpoints, ‘translocated’ to many unique sites . for example, 17/ <dig> tumours  had a total of  <dig> ‘translocation breakpoints’ within a  <dig> kb region at  <dig>  mb  on chromosome  <dig>  within an intron of the ttc <dig> gene, up to seven in the same tumour, and the joined ‘breakpoints’ were all different. similarly, four tumours had a total of  <dig> junctions at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and seven tumours had a total of  <dig> at  <dig>  mb on chromosome x . these could be distinguished from typical artefactual ‘translocations’ resulting from misalignment of reads to repeat sequences, because usually both ‘breakpoints’ of such events are joined to multiple partner breakpoints. they also did not resemble true recurrent translocations because the breakpoints were clustered into too small a region, generally 1kb or less. for many—typically a quarter to a half—of the junctions, paired-end sequencing detected a neighbouring junction, suggesting that the ‘translocation’ was reciprocal, perhaps with a small duplication at the breakpoint  <cit> , or was in fact an insertion. for example,  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosome  <dig> ‘translocations’ had two junctions .fig.  <dig> mobile element inserts mimic multiple translocations. circos plot of mobile element inserts detected by discordant read pairs in tumour  <dig>  which had the highest number detected. the genome is displayed as a circle, chromosomes  <dig> to y, with curved lines representing the apparent rearrangements detected. for example, the many apparent junctions between chromosome  <dig> and other chromosomes , represent copies of a chromosome  <dig> sequence that have been transduced and inserted all over the genome

in the  <dig> tumours of batch p, seven distinct loci had at least five of these translocation-like junctions, spread over more than one tumour, each breakpoint within 1kb of the next , which were verified by pcr as described below.

we hypothesized that these were insertions of l <dig> mobile elements, and to explore this idea we searched both batch p and the  <dig> batch b <dig> tumours for rearrangement junctions that mapped to, or close to, the 3’ ends of the  <dig> l1s in the reference genome that are thought to be capable of mobilisation . this identified nine junction clusters, two of which were among the seven originally identified .

the combined list of apparent inserts was compared to known l <dig>  alu and sva polymorphisms  <cit>  and only eight  ‘insert sites’ corresponded to known polymorphisms that we had failed to sample in the normals .

inspection of the inserts suggested two ways in which inserts created by mobile elements could be identified as rearrangements by conventional paired-end-read mapping: the first, when the inserts included unique sequence transduced by the mobile element, and the second, when the insert included sequence that could be—correctly or incorrectly—uniquely matched to a mobile element in the reference genome .

the first way accounted for several ‘clusters’ of inserts that included unique sequence that mapped 3’ to the end of an l <dig> in the reference genome . the chromosome  <dig> element was typical—inserts included sequence 3’ to an l <dig> at chr22: 29059272– <dig>  extending to at least  <dig> 

two further clusters of inserts of unique sequence—at chromosome 3:  <dig>  mb and chromosome 14:  <dig>  mb —resembled transduced sequence but were not adjacent to l1s in the reference genome. they were adjacent to polymorphic l1s absent from the reference genome  <cit>  and known to transduce 3’ flanking sequence  <cit>  . the chromosome  <dig> element, for example, is inserted in the reference sequence at  <dig> in  <dig> % of the population sampled by tubio et al.  <cit> , in the plus direction. our inserts all ended in polya added at map position 59221073– <dig> .

the second way that candidate inserts were detected, was when a cluster of breakpoints was mapped to the 3’ terminus of an l <dig> or alu in the reference genome with or without a polya tail. although these sequences are ‘repeats’, they are sufficiently distinct in the reference genome that aligners  may align reads confidently to these positions because they match a read better than anywhere else . for example,  <dig> rearrangement junctions, spread over nine tumours, were mapped to the 3’ end of an l <dig> that ends at  <dig> , <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig> and is followed by a  <dig> bp gap then 20as.

similarly, approximately  <dig> junctions, in  <dig> tumours, mapped to the longest polya run in the reference genome, the 90-bp polya tail of an alu at chr12:66451373– <dig>  while  <dig> junctions in  <dig> tumours mapped to the  <dig> bp polya tail of an aluya <dig> at chr15: 77910868– <dig>  the interpretation of these depended on the aligner used. the novoalign aligner , which can trim reads more to achieve a match, generally aligned reads to them solely because they contained  <dig> or more polya/t, without alu sequence, but with or without a few bp 3’ to the polya that may represent common target site sequence. for example, the read ttattcgggagagagatttttttttt was aligned to the chromosome  <dig> locus by matching the ttattc and polyt, then trimming off the remaining base pairs. of three tested by pcr for each locus , all were somatic inserts. two were essentially only polya while four included an l1hs 3’ terminus ignored by the aligner.

the aligner bwa  aligned reads to these polya runs by matching polya plus some recognisable alu sequence. their apparent insertion sites were 3’ to reference alu sequences, and two—at about  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  mb on chromosome 2—were common to two tumours, so these may represent germline polymorphisms of longer polya tails on these reference alus that we failed to sample in the matched normals and normal panel.

thus this second class of apparent rearrangements are where an aligner confidently maps reads to the 3’ end or polya of a mobile element in the reference genome. these may occasionally represent mobilisations of that reference mobile element, but more commonly will be incorrect mappings of an insert from an unrelated element, or a polymorphism.

a third class of apparent junction, observed only using the novoalign aligner, appeared to be a special case of such mismappings, which we designated ‘split mappings’. apparently, reads from within one mobile element insert were mapped to different places in the reference genome . for example, we identified a ‘translocation junction’ between chromosome 14: <dig>  mb, which is sequence transduced by an l <dig>  and the polya run at chromosome 15: <dig>  mb . presumably the sequence reads are from an insert of the chromosome  <dig> l <dig> that has transduced flanking sequence, and its added polya tail. we detected ‘junctions’ of this kind that mapped to the chromosome  <dig> and x_a transduced sequences at one end and either the chromosome  <dig> or  <dig> polya runs at the other. four other junctions appeared similar, joining the chromosome  <dig> or  <dig> loci either to an l1hs at chr2:88206897– <dig> or sequences found to be transduced by tubio et al.  <cit>  .

verification and structure of inserts
using pcr, we verified that rearrangement junctions existed and were somatic for at least two inserts from each element in table  <dig>  except the chr <dig> element  and chr <dig> . inserts with read pairs at both ends were preferred  . for 25/ <dig> inserts we were able to amplify across the insert, using primers designed to the expected flanking sequence . for a further  <dig>  we were able to amplify across at least one junction, giving an overall verification rate of 42/ <dig> tumour inserts . failure to amplify some junctions and inserts is not surprising, since some inserts would be too large to amplify and many primers were designed by guessing the other side of an insert, which could have been rearranged or deleted  <cit> . all inserts were tumour-specific. amplifying across the inserts gave a product from the normal target site, common to the tumour and matched normal, plus a larger band unique to the tumour. in addition, a weaker intermediate band was often obtained, which on cloning and sequencing gave sequence the same as the normal or insert band and therefore we suspected was a hybrid between the normal and insert bands. supporting this interpretation, when excised and re-run, the normal and larger insert bands ran as expected, while the intermediate band regenerated the pattern of three bands.fig.  <dig> verification of representative inserts. a flanking junctions of an insert from chromosome  <dig> into enpp <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in tumour  <dig>  b pcr across four representative inserts, of elements denoted chr x_b, chr  <dig>  chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> respectively. note that in addition to the larger, tumour-specific band in most cases there is an intermediate size band, most clearly in the last example. c sequence of insert in a, showing target site duplication , insert of chromosome  <dig> material and polya tail



all verified inserts had the expected structure, allowing for known variations. all had a polya tail, with upstream insert sequence variably truncated . most were flanked by target site duplication, up to 20bp, as expected  <cit> , though some inserts showed zero duplication or even a small deletion . variations included partial inversion of the 5’ end of the inserted sequence—about  <dig> %  of inserts where both ends were found by discordant read analysis. for example, the insert shown in fig.  <dig>  of chr <dig> into chr  <dig> consisted principally of chr <dig> sequence, from 29066229– <dig>  3’ to the intact l <dig> that ends at  <dig>  followed by 37bp of polya . there was an apparent small inversion at the 5’ end, with the first  <dig> bp of the insert mapping in the reverse orientation  <dig> bp upstream to the main chr <dig> material, consistent with the proposed mechanism for inversion  <cit> . the insert was flanked by an 18-bp target site duplication.

the inserts we verified and sequenced across ranged from 1bp  to about 1kb excluding the polya, and the polya sequences ranged from roughly  <dig> to over  <dig> . the inserts of transduced 3’ unique sequence included part or all of the transduced unique sequence, with or without part of the upstream l1hs sequence. for example, the insert previously described included no l1hs sequence, while the insert of the chr <dig> element into chr <dig> included 69bp of the 3’ end of the  l1hs together with 931bp of unique chromosome  <dig> material downstream of this end.

the sequences transduced 3’ to intact l1s mostly were bounded by polya addition sites  <dig> - <dig>  kb from the l <dig>  though one, from the element at  <dig>  mb on chromosome x, extended only 24bp from the l <dig>  for some the polya addition sites varied, e.g. for the chromosome  <dig> element, the l <dig> of which ends at  <dig> , <dig>  there were two cases of polya addition at  <dig> , <dig>  two at  <dig> , <dig>  one at  <dig> , <dig>  and others. the chr <dig> element was found both with 3’ unique sequence transduced and without any transduced sequence.

estimating abundance of inserts by detecting polya
since the total number of l1–mediated insertions is likely to be much greater than detected by discordant read pairs, which only works where reads in the insert can be mapped uniquely to the reference genome, we obtained a rough estimate of total inserts by searching for tumour-specific polya sequence, hypothesising that most of these would be l1-mediated insertion events.

we searched the  <dig> tumours of sets p and b <dig> for reads that contained at least  <dig> consecutive as or ts and were paired with sequence reads that were confidently mapped by the bwa aligner. from these we extracted candidate inserts that were supported by at least three read pairs and absent not only from the matched normal but also the  <dig> or  <dig> other normals from the same batch of tumours . we compared these candidate insert sites to known polymorphic l1s and alus  <cit> , and about  <dig> %  were within 1kb, without considering direction of read. as a control, the analysis was repeated with each b <dig> tumour interchanged with its matched normal: this detected only an average of  <dig>  candidate normal-specific polya sequence runs , suggesting that relatively few of the inserts detected in the tumours were merely bioinformatic artefacts or polymorphisms that we had failed to detect in the matched sample.

we confirmed that the great majority of these candidate insertions resembled tumour-specific l <dig> events, by manually scrutinizing a random sample of  <dig> of the least-confident examples, i.e. those supported by only three reads. we viewed all sequence reads within an approximately 600bp window spanning the candidate insert site, using the integrative genomics viewer   <cit>  . all  <dig> showed additional aberrant reads including additional ‘split’ or ‘soft-clipped’ reads  that clearly identified an insertion point. in 18/ <dig> cases these split reads included l <dig> sequence. in one further case the sequence appeared to be transduced. in only 1/ <dig> cases was the insert clearly germline, while only one further case had a single read in the normal that could possibly have supported a germline insert .

for around  <dig> % of an independent unbiased sample of the candidate tumour-specific polya sequence we were able to verify a retrotransposon insert by pcr across the candidate insert site, and some of the failures might have been inserts that were too large to amplify .  <dig> primer pairs were designed, of which  <dig> pairs successfully amplified a normal band from the matched normal.  <dig> of these  <dig>  amplified a larger band from the tumour. all these insert bands were absent from the matched normal.  <dig> of these  <dig> were cloned and sequenced. all showed an insert that included polya, together with additional sequence . 10/ <dig> had target site duplication, suggesting they were indeed non-ltr retrotransposon events. 8/ <dig> included the 3’ end of l1hs sequence, for example, the largest was 7416_ <dig>  almost 600bp, comprising around  <dig> bp of l <dig> sequence, slightly rearranged, with two stretches of polya separated by a 75bp fragment of chromosome  <dig>  flanked by duplication of tagaagcccaatttct. the three without l <dig> sequence included the smallest, 7436_ <dig>  which was atataataataat + polya, flanked both sides by ccca, which is a duplication of the native chromosome  <dig> target site. atataataataat does not match the end of a consensus l1hs or alu. insert 7416_ <dig> comprised  <dig> bp unique sequence from chromosome 10: <dig> ,239- <dig> , <dig>  plus polya and duplication of aagaaatatttccc. insert 7416_ <dig> was about 1kb of unique sequence from chromosome  <dig> chr17:46707420– <dig>  inserted with a target site duplication of 14bp, but with polya at both ends, a <dig> and a <dig> allowing for the original sequence, in the same orientation. neither of these two are near reference l1s or known polymorphic l1s  <cit> . they might represent undocumented polymorphic l1s or re-mobilisation of somatic inserts  <cit> , and, indeed, discordant read pairs show nine rearrangement breakpoints within chr17:46707414– <dig> in tumour  <dig>  indicating multiple transductions of this sequence.

a further four inserts were also verified, three chosen because they were in genes, park <dig>  foxp <dig> and sntg .

taking  <dig> % as an estimate of validity, our rough estimate of tumour-specific inserts identified by polya sequence ranged from five  to about  <dig>  average approximately  <dig> . this is over six times the number of inserts from the elements listed in table  <dig> detected as rearrangement junctions. this may be an underestimate because read pairs have to be placed precisely to detect the inserts, and some of the tumours are contaminated enough with normal cells to reduce sensitivity of detection.table  <dig> active elements in individual tumours

combining the inserts found by discordant read pairs and our polya search , most of the tumours have evidence of somatic mobile element activity. only 10/ <dig>  tumours did not have either five or more inserts detected by discordant pairs or > <dig> candidate inserts detected by polya , and one of these  had a verified insert . on the other hand, there are a few tumours that may well not have activity, notably the 4/ <dig> tumours that have zero or one unverified insert detected by discordant reads.

effects on genes
among the inserts found by analysing discordant reads pairs, 198/ <dig>  were in a gene listed by ensembl. of these, approximately  <dig> were in the same transcription direction as the gene,  <dig> in the opposite orientation. .

five inserts seemed particularly likely to affect gene function: four were in coding sequence, of mrpl <dig> and zan , sycp <dig> and zdhhc14; and one was in the 3’ utr of pde10a .

several genes had inserts in more than one tumour : agbl <dig>  dlg <dig> and sntg <dig> had insertions in three tumours; agbl <dig>  areg, edil <dig>  epha <dig>  gpm6a, lrp1b, negr <dig>  nrxn <dig>  pgcp, and plakha <dig> had insertions in two tumours. agbl <dig>  robo <dig>  eys and ryr <dig> appeared to have two insertions in distinct sites in the same tumour, though these could be insertions at a single rearrangement junction, since this is known to occur  <cit> .

among the insertions detected by polya search , which are less reliable and may be too small to affect gene function, a number of genes had inserts in several tumours, but these were very large genes  such as lsamp, so the significance is unclear .

discussion
mobile elements found
our search for novel polya sequence showed that retrotransposition occurs in the majority of oesophageal adenocarcinomas—40/ <dig> had  <dig> or more candidate insertions —and the number of novel inserts, though very variable, was often in the hundreds according to the search for tumour-specific polya runs.

mobile element activity has previously been explored in several cancer types, by various methods. some relied on l <dig> sequence to permit single-ended pcr of junctions or capture of junction fragments by hybridization  <cit> ; others have used illumina whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic tools such as tea and transposeq   <cit>  and trafic   <cit>  to identify likely l <dig> insertion and transduction  <cit>  events; while rodic et al.  <cit>  used staining with well-validated polyclonal and monoclonal anti-line- <dig> orf1p protein on tissue microarrays to detect ongoing l <dig> activity. together these suggest that carcinomas have more l <dig> activity than non-epithelial cancers, with more than half of cases having detectable orf1p protein and detectable inserts. among carcinomas surveyed, lung nsclc, head-and-neck squamous and colorectal had relatively more inserts identified than breast and prostate   . the high variability between cases of a carcinoma was illustrated by lee et al.  <cit>  who detected  <dig> to  <dig> inserts in  <dig> of  <dig> colorectal cancers but  <dig> in the remaining case, which also showed hypermutation and high cpg island methylation .

allowing for differences in approach, our results  are consistent with these surveys, and probably place oesophageal adenocarcinomas among the tumour types with more frequent and abundant inserts, such as colorectal and lung cancers. trafic  <cit>  detected  <dig> to  <dig> inserts in  <dig> lung cancers, with  <dig> having  <dig> or more, and  <dig> % of patients with at least some; while  <dig> colorectal cancers had 0– <dig> inserts, with only one tumour negative.

our identification of candidate inserts simply by polya has the advantage of high sensitivity but might be less robust than more stringent approaches. however, pcr across the candidate insert sites—which would fail for larger inserts and so underestimates our accuracy—succeeded in amplifying an insert with retrotransposon-like characteristics in about  <dig> % of cases, and manual curation of reads from  <dig> low-confidence examples showed that all had additional split reads that supported the presence of an insert. we might have expected occasional inserts to be polymorphisms overlooked in the matched normal, but all that amplified in our unbiased sample were unique to the tumour, only about  <dig> % were found among known polymorphisms  <cit> , and only one or possibly  <dig> of  <dig> manually curated examples had any evidence they were germline.

the mobile element inserts we identified had the expected structure, allowing for known variations such as inversion of the 5’ end, as explored in more detail by others  <cit> . among the less familiar variations, one of the inserts found in our polya search, 7416_ <dig>  had polya at both ends. extreme examples of truncation were found, including one insert of polya plus 1bp and target duplication .

as expected, all the intact l1s implicated in formation of our inserts were from family l1hs, the human-specific l <dig> family, thought to be the only currently-active l1s. most were in the original list of active ‘hot l1s’ prepared by brouha et al.  <cit> , based on december  <dig> genome data plus functional assay of the l1’s activity in vitro. our list includes their three most active l1s and eight of our list are in their top  <dig>  however, this is biased by our use of the hot l1s to find examples. one of our original three active l1s identified purely from read pairs, on chromosome  <dig>  was not listed by brouha et al.  <cit> , but matches their consensus sequence  <dig>  %. two of the most active elements, the chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> elements, are l1s absent from the reference but present respectively in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cases examined by tubio et al.  <cit> .

we did not find positive evidence of alu mobilisation. although we found discordant reads aligned adjacent to alus on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  these alignments were essentially to their polya tails, as discussed below.

why are the transduced sequences unique?
a puzzling feature of the 3’ transduction events is that the sequence transduced is unique in the reference genome. this is paradoxical since, if the mobile element were active in the germline, there should be multiple copies in the reference genome. it follows that there may be 3’ transduced sequences that are not unique in the genome because they have already been copied. like l1s, new inserts of these sequences will not be mapped by aligners and so will usually go undetected.

activation of multiple elements
as also noted by others  <cit> , the 3’ transduction events, which identify the l <dig> that gave rise to the insert  show that, where inserts were detected in a tumour, several elements were often mobile, rather than individual elements becoming active singly . however, two of the three tumours with 12_a inserts had no other junctions detected, and the relative number of inserts of elements  <dig> and x_a varied from 6: <dig> in tumours  <dig> and  <dig>  to 1: <dig> in tumour  <dig>  suggesting some differential activation, unless detection is skewed by technical details such as the aligner used, different fragment size and effective coverage in sequencing of the two tumour batches. differences in activity of the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> elements are of course partly determined by whether or not the individual has the element.

activation and genetic instability
an interesting corollary is that activation of these elements might constitute a new type of genetic instability in cancer. however, we cannot say whether l1s are specifically activated in these tumours or are also active in normal cells, because the non-cancer cells may be too polyclonal for new inserts to be detected. also, even if activation is cancer-specific, it is not necessarily a distinct genetic instability phenotype: in particular, p53/tp <dig> mutation may be permissive for cells to survive activation of retrotransposons  <cit> , and activation may be just one consequence of p <dig> loss. almost all these oesophageal adenocarcinomas are p <dig> mutant , and two  of the three tumours where no insertions were detected by discordant reads were two of the five tumours with no detected p <dig> mutation .

do the inserts mutate genes?
mobile element insertions can alter genes in various ways  <cit> . apart from direct insertion into exons—as in the apc gene in a colon cancer  <cit> —they can terminate transcription by providing a polya addition site, either the site used in creating the insert mrna or, when in reverse orientation, an antisense polya addition site about  <dig>  kb from the 3’ end of the consensus l <dig> sequence  <cit> . but the 5’ utr can also activate expression, in either orientation, since it includes a potent antisense promoter.

some of our inserts might be in driver genes. the insert shown in fig.  <dig> is in enpp <dig>  which is a nucleotide phosphodiesterase and phospholipase. it is fused in the breast cancer cell line zr-75- <dig>  <cit>  and may be upregulated in cancers. of the genes listed in results—with inserts in exons or almost in exons, or with multiple inserts—robo <dig> is a candidate tumour suppressor  <cit> , and is a target of insertions in colon tumours  <cit> .

among the genes with single inserts in introns, detected by discordant read pairs, are several identified elsewhere as likely drivers: cnbd <dig> reaches driver status in exonic mutations  <cit> , while rspo <dig> is a known oncogene  <cit> . tubio et al.  <cit>  recorded an insert in cnbd <dig> also. cntnap <dig> was highlighted as relatively frequently mutated in exome sequencing of oesophageal adenocarcinoma  <cit> .

activation of genes by inserts may be important. davoli et al.  <cit>  analysed reported patterns of mutation to identify likely tumour suppressors and oncogenes. we found many inserts in genes scored with moderate confidence  as oncogenes—col22a <dig>  csmd <dig>  gabrg <dig>  pgm <dig>  ralyl, rgs <dig>  rsrc <dig>  and trps1—while no inserts were in candidate tumour suppressors at confidence  <dig> or  <dig>  several of these genes and sycp <dig>  mentioned above, are involved in gene fusions: rgs <dig>  sycp <dig> and trps <dig> in breast cancer cell lines  <cit> , and rspo <dig> in colon cancers  <cit> . this hints at insertional activation.

how inserts are detected by paired-end analysis
we classified the inserts we found based on how they were identified by aligning sequences to the reference genome . most current strategies for analysis of structural variation in the genome by paired-end sequencing, as generated by the illumina technology, rely on matching sequences to the reference genome, then looking for such abnormalities as ‘discordant read pairs’ where the reads map an abnormal distance apart, e.g. to different chromosomes; or ‘split reads’, where different parts of the same individual sequence read map to different locations in the genome  <cit> .

mobile element insertions give a variety of unexpected behaviours in such analysis. the first class of inserts we identified were inserts that include unique sequence located 3’ to l1s and had been transduced: these inserts appear to be junctions between the unique sequence and somewhere else in the genome. many of the inserts appear to be translocations because the other end of the insert is repeat sequence, and therefore is not identified by discordant reads. we identified nine l1hs elements that transduce sequence this way, eight of which have been recorded by tubio et al.  <cit> , who described a total of  <dig>  these inserts subdivide according to whether the l <dig> is in the reference genome or not . many recent l <dig> insertions in the germline are active, and are polymorphic and absent from the reference genome  <cit> . transduction by non-reference l1s is more difficult to identify because it requires a list of all active polymorphic l1s or a search of the matched normal genome for l1s. our two examples—the chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> elements—were only detected by us because they are present in many individuals and very active, so produced large numbers of apparent breakpoints within a kilobase or so.

the second major class of inserts detected by discordant read pairs were inserts that the aligner software could map uniquely to a mobile element or its associated polya, in the reference genome. these also resembled translocations to, or insertions of, the reference element. the inserts did not necessarily come from that element, because the alignments may have depended on the presence of polya. most striking were the chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> ‘elements’, which are the longest and third-longest polya runs in the reference genome. the novoalign aligner, which has enhanced ability to trim reads to obtain a match, confidently mapped reads here merely because they contained a long polya string. in raw sequence alignments we also found reads aligned to the second-longest polya run, 83bp at chr6:160521756– <dig>  but only one junction with this mapping was unique to a tumour and so appeared as a candidate junction.

finally, some apparent ‘translocation junctions’ were not even junctions, but occurred when read pairs within a mobile element insert were mapped to two distinct loci . typically, one read of a pair was in transduced sequence, the other was in the polya tail and mapped to one of the long polya runs in the reference.

consequences for paired-end sequencing
our data highlight difficulties and pitfalls in identifying mobile element insertions in paired-end sequencing data, and in distinguishing them from genomic rearrangements, some of which have already been flagged by pitkänen et al.  <cit>  and tubio et al.  <cit> .

searches for mobile element inserts will have to allow for truncation and transduction, which result in inserts that may have little or no sequence from the mobile element proper  <cit> . of our  <dig> sequenced polya inserts, all but one had target site duplications, as expected of non-ltr retrotransposons, but only 11/ <dig> had l <dig> sequence in the insert, while the other  <dig> had unique sequence or a fragment that was unrelated to l <dig> and too small to map. trafic  <cit>  attempts to address this problem.

it will also be difficult to achieve high sensitivity. to identify inserts from discordant reads, the reads have to fall in exactly the right places , reducing effective coverage, and many inserts are too small to accommodate a whole read—of the  <dig> polya inserts we sequenced, four were smaller than 100bp excluding the polya, and one was only 13bp +  <dig> as. split read analysis will help , but may introduce additional artefacts such as ‘split mappings’ . it may be helpful to flag and isolate runs of polya as a specific feature of reads.

mobile element inserts create difficulties for interpreting structural rearrangements of the genome. inserts maybe misidentified as translocations  <cit> . for some inserts, junctions will be found at both ends, but these are still indistinguishable from reciprocal translocations, especially since translocations may have duplication or deletion at the breakpoints  <cit> . often there is no sign that the insert is an insert, because the junction 5’ relative to the mrna intermediate is not unique and so not detected. cataloguing transducable sequences will help, but since some somatically acquired l <dig> insertions can go on to generate new insertions  <cit> , such catalogues will never be exhaustive. again, searches for novel polya may help.

finally, our results illustrate that different aligners will produce different artefacts.

CONCLUSIONS
new mobile element insertions are abundant in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. since inserts may inactivate or activate genes, they are likely to contribute to mutation burden. the inserts create a variety of problems for the interpretation of paired-end sequencing as currently performed. many element insertions will be missed in searches for l1s, because they are truncated and carry little or no l <dig> sequence. conventional searches for structural rearrangements of the genome will miss inserts because their ends consist of repeat sequences and polya, which cannot be mapped to the reference genome by aligner software. even those that that are detected may resemble structural variants, and they may be difficult to identify with mobile element activity because the insert will not always contain retrotransposon sequence  <cit> .
