BACKGROUND
taste buds, the end-organs for gustation, detect and respond to a variety of macronutrient and aversive compounds to generate taste perception. compounds that evoke bitter taste bind to one or more g protein coupled receptors  of the t2r family of taste receptors  <cit> . amino acids and compounds that elicit umami taste bind to a variety of gpcrs including metabotropic glutamate receptors, mglur <dig> and mglur <dig>  and the heterodimeric taste receptor, t1r1+t1r <dig>  <cit> . sugars and a variety of other sweeteners bind to the heterodimeric receptor, t1r2+t1r <dig> <cit> . most of these various taste gpcrs appear to all couple to a common transduction pathway that includes the heterotrimeric g protein subunits, gβ <dig> and gγ <dig>  a phospholipase c, plcβ <dig>  and a transient receptor potential ion channel, trpm <dig>  <cit> .

in spite of the detailed exploration of the gβγ-triggered signaling, much less is understood of which gα subunits couple to various taste gpcrs, and which downstream signaling pathways they recruit. taste buds are reported to express a number of different subunits including gαgus , gαs, gαi, gαq, gα <dig>  gα <dig> and two transducin isoforms, gαt <dig> and gαt <dig>  <cit> . apart from gαgus, it remains unknown which of these are expressed in the same cells as taste gpcrs and might be candidate signaling partners. in vitro, the sweet taste receptor, t1r2+t1r <dig>  couples via gαi to camp modulation <cit> . although gαi subunits are expressed in taste buds <cit> , it is unclear which receptors activate them in situ. biochemical and physiological studies have suggested that bitter taste transduction includes the involvement of gαgus, although the exact mechanism of such involvement remained unclear <cit> . while gαgus-knockout mice are quite insensitive to bitter tastants, they are also somewhat compromised in their detection of sweet tastants <cit> . gustducin is co-expressed with the t1r2+t1r <dig> sweet receptor in the palate  <cit>  and fungiform papillae <cit>  but not in the posterior gustatory fields. furthermore, the direct functional role of gαgus in sweet detection has not been demonstrated. the gαgus, gαi and gαs subunits alter camp levels when activated, while members of the gαq family trigger release of stored ca2+. the primary cellular response triggered by tastants appears to be a ca2+ signal. although much of this signal is produced via the action of gβγ subunits <cit> , the contribution of the gαq family has not been examined in taste buds.

mammalian taste buds are composed of up to  <dig> cells. though most mature cells in taste buds have a generally fusiform shape, they can be distinguished into several distinct types based on their functional properties and the expression of diagnostic mrna and protein markers. based on ultrastructural and other criteria, cells in rodent taste buds are classified as "type i", the glial-like or supporting cells, "type ii", the primary receptor cells, and "type iii", the cells that show specialized chemical synapses <cit> . type ii cells are characterized by the ubiquitous expression of plcβ <dig> and trpm <dig>  <cit> . subsets of type ii cells express either t2rs or t1rs <cit> , an observation that suggested the segregated detection of tastants of the sweet and bitter qualities. subsequent functional studies have demonstrated the equivalence of cell types identified by expression patterns and cells with particular response profiles. for instance, cells that express ncam and snap <dig> were shown to be those that display voltage-gated calcium channels <cit> . cells that express trpm <dig> or plcβ <dig> are those that respond to bitter or sweet stimuli <cit> . here, we have used rt-pcr, immunocytochemistry and single-cell gene expression profiling to examine the expression of the gαq family  <cit>  in mouse taste buds and establish which of these are co-expressed with t1r <dig> and t1r <dig>  subunits that constitute the sweet taste gpcr. the pattern of expression suggests that gαgus is unlikely to be a signaling partner for t1r2+t1r <dig>  instead, the sweet receptor subunits consistently are co-expressed with gα <dig> 

RESULTS
gαq family members are differentially expressed in different taste fields
first, we used end-point rt-pcr to evaluate the expression of gαq family subunits in taste buds to assess which members, if any, of the gαq family  are expressed in taste buds. we analyzed taste buds obtained from four different oral taste fields  as well as non-taste lingual and palatal epithelium.

as shown in fig. 1a, gα <dig> is strongly expressed in vallate and foliate taste buds, with somewhat lower expression in the palate. under parallel conditions, expression of gα <dig> was negligible in the fungiform field. gαq also was not detected in fungiform papillae, and its mrna was seen in taste buds from vallate, foliate and palate. finally, we observed that gα <dig> appeared to be expressed similarly in taste buds of all taste fields. of these three gα subunits, gαq and gα <dig> were detected in non-taste mrna at roughly similar levels as in taste buds. in contrast, gα <dig> was expressed in a highly taste-selective manner. we also tested expression of the distantly related subunit, gα <dig>  we detected rt-pcr product for gα <dig> prominently in the nontaste epithelium samples and very little in vallate taste bud samples . thus, we did not investigate this subunit further. the taste selective expression pattern and apparently high mrna level of gα <dig> suggested that it may be the principal gαq family member playing a taste-specific role in murine taste buds.

to test this, we undertook quantitative rt-pcr experiments to compare expression levels of the gαq family members in taste buds . the concentration of gα <dig> mrna in vallate taste buds was comparable to that of plcβ <dig> mrna. neither mrna was expressed in nontaste epithelium. in contrast, gαq mrna was found at similar concentration in cv taste buds and in nontaste epithelium while gα <dig> was at much higher concentration in nontaste epithelium than in taste epithelium. thus, neither gα <dig> or gαq are expressed in a taste-selective manner. further, the mrnas for gαq and gα <dig> are expressed at 14- and 80-fold lower concentrations respectively than gα <dig> mrna. these data support our interpretation from end-point rt-pcr, that the only gα subunit of this family that is likely to have a taste-selective role is gα <dig> 

taste buds contain two cell types that have been functionally defined to date, type ii/receptor cells and type iii/presynaptic cells. to assess whether gαq, gα <dig> or gα <dig> are selectively expressed in these two cell types, we used plcβ2-gfp and gad-gfp transgenic mice that respectively illuminate type ii and iii taste cells  <cit> . individual gfp-labeled cells from each strain were harvested to produce  <dig> pools, each of  <dig> cells, representing type ii and type iii cells respectively. we examined expression of the gα subunits by rt-pcr on amplified rna from these  <dig> pools . gα <dig> expression was limited to type ii cells and was detected in each of the three pools. in contrast, gαq expression was less prominent, and was found in type ii, type iii and non-taste epithelial cells, consistent with the qrt-pcr data of fig. 1b. gα <dig> was only sporadically detected in the pools of identified taste cells, consistent with the low level seen in qrt-pcr with whole vallate taste buds. the absence of gα <dig> in the isolated non-taste cells may reflect the heterogeneity of the non-taste epithelium, with some regions expressing gα <dig> and others not. in summary, rt-pcr analyses suggested that gα <dig>  expressed only in taste buds, and only in type ii/receptor cells within taste buds, was a reasonable candidate for coupling to a taste gpcr.

immunoreactivity to gαq-family in gαgus-negative type ii cells
next, we used an antiserum that recognizes gαq, gα <dig> and gα <dig> to perform fluorescent immunocytochemistry on cryosections of taste epithelia. the gq/11/ <dig> antibody reacted with a subset of taste cells in posterior  but not anterior  oral taste fields . immunoreactive cells in each case were elongate and spindle-shaped, as is typical for mature taste cells. immunoreactivity appeared to be membrane-associated, largely encircling the taste cell profiles of immunoreactive cells. relative to the signal in the vallate papilla, immunoreactivity to gq/11/ <dig> antibody occurred only rarely in cells of taste buds in the soft palate, and was essentially absent in taste buds of the fungiform papillae and pharynx .

gαq-family-immunoreactivity is not due to gαq nor gα11
to assess whether the gαq-family immunoreactivity was attributable to gαq, we examined immunoreactivity with the same gq/11/ <dig> antibody in gαq-ko mice. in vallate taste buds, staining with anti-gq/11/ <dig> was essentially no different in gαq-ko mice compared to wt controls . staining with anti-gαgus antibody also shows no difference in the gαq-ko compared to wt animals  indicating that the gαq-ko did not disrupt expression of other taste-related g-proteins. the robust staining by the gq/11/ <dig> antibody in gαq-ko mice indicates that the bulk of the staining observed with gq/11/ <dig> antibody must be attributable to gα <dig> or gα <dig>  because the rt-pcr data  showed that gα <dig> is expressed at very low levels, the combined analyses suggest that gα <dig> is the principal gαq family subunit in type ii  cells.

to further test whether gα <dig> is present in taste buds, we utilized an antiserum directed against the n-terminal region of gα <dig> which shares no sequence similarity to the n-terminal region of either gαq or gα <dig>  this gα11-specific antiserum does not stain taste buds  although it does stain the cerebellar molecular layer  in which gα <dig> is detectable by immunocytochemistry <cit> . these results essentially rule out gα <dig> as the source of the taste bud immunoreactivity for the gq/11/ <dig> antibody. since this gq/11/ <dig> antibody exhibits staining in gαq knockout mice, we conclude that the staining is attributable to neither gαq nor gα <dig> leaving only gα <dig> as the possible source of the immunoreactivity. these results are entirely consistent with our rt-pcr data  showing that gα <dig> mrna is the predominant gαq family member isoform expressed in a taste-specific manner.

gαq-family-immunoreactivity is in type ii taste  cells
taste buds  comprise at least three different types of mature cells, so we utilized type-specific markers to test whether gαq-family expression correlates with a specific cell type. type ii  cells express the gpcr taste receptors , trpm <dig> and plcβ <dig>  <cit> . thus, we performed the first set of immunocytochemistry using tissues from trpm5-gfp mice in which all gfp labeled taste cells express the trpm <dig> protein <cit> . in vallate taste buds, plcβ <dig> antibody stained over 92%  of trpm5-gfp-labeled cells, confirming the identification of type ii cells with these markers. further, in vallate taste buds, immunoreactivity to pgp <dig>  antibody, which stains mostly type iii cells  <cit> ) was detectable only in a small percentage of trpm5-gfp positive cells .

next, we compared immunostaining for gq/11/ <dig> with staining for markers of type ii and type iii taste cells. in vallate and foliate taste buds of trpm5-gfp mice, the gq/11/ <dig> antibody stained a subset of trpm5-gfp cells . nearly all gq/11/ <dig> positive cells expressed trpm5-gfp , i.e. gαq-family protein  is expressed only in type ii taste cells. we also immunostained the sections for gαgus and viewed them for fluorescence in three colors: gfp  for trpm <dig>  alexa <dig>  for gαgus and rhodamine redx  for gq/11/ <dig>  most taste cells that were immunoreactive for gq/11/ <dig> lacked expression of gαgus . in contrast, antiserum to pgp <dig>   stained none of the gq/11/14-positive cells . we conclude that gαq-family immunoreactivity is not in type iii cells, but is common in the trpm5-immunoreactive  receptor cell population.

results from immunocytochemistry are not significantly different  from data from single cell rt-pcr . the immunocytochemical data and rt-pcr data showing co-expression of gustducin with t1rs is not directly comparable since some cells express only t1r <dig> and not t1r2+t1r3

gαq-family immunoreactivity in t1r3-expressing cells
type ii cells in taste buds express g protein coupled taste receptors for sweet, bitter or umami qualities. the taste receptors for sweet  and for bitter  are expressed in separate subsets of type ii cells <cit> . in taste membranes, bitter  taste receptors couple functionally to gαgus  <cit> . yet to date, it is unclear which gα subunits natively couple to the other class of taste receptors, the t1rs. because t1r <dig> appears to be an obligatory subunit in these dimeric receptors, we used t1r3-gfp transgenic mice, to ask whether the gαq family subunits are co-expressed with t1r <dig>  by double-immunostaining , in vallate papillae we found that the gq/11/ <dig> antibody stained the majority of t1r3-gfp cells . in contrast, a smaller fraction of t1r3-gfp cells were strongly positive for gαgus  . thus gαgus expression does not correlate with t1r <dig> expression and therefore cannot be an obligatory partner in taste buds in vallate papillae.

single-cell rt-pcr shows co-expression of gα <dig> with t1r2/t1r3
we used transgenic plcβ2-gfp mice to isolate individual gfp-labeled  cells and performed single cell-rt-pcr as an independent test of the expression pattern of gαq-family subunits and sweet receptors . because gα <dig> expression was limited to a low concentration of mrna  and only in a few cells , we did not include it in this analysis. for this detailed analysis, we collected  <dig> individual plcβ2-gfp-expressing  cells and  <dig> plcβ2-gfp-negative cells. as expected, trpm <dig> was expressed in all  <dig> plcβ2-gfp cells, and was not detected in gfp-negative cells . the taste receptors, t1r <dig> and t1r <dig> were detected in approximately half of gfp-positive cells . all  <dig> of these t1r2+t1r3-expressing cells also expressed gα <dig> . in contrast, gαq was detected in 50%, and gαgus in only 40% of these t1r2+t1r3-expressing cells. in summary, gα <dig> is always found in presumptive sweet-sensing type ii/receptor cells. additionally, gα <dig> was not detected in the absence of t1r <dig>  thus, we propose that gα <dig> may be the principal gα subunit coupled to the sweet receptors.

discussion
using the complementary techniques of immunocytochemistry and gene expression profiling via single-cell rt-pcr, we have explored the pattern of expression of the gαq family of heterotrimeric g protein subunits. we show that while gαq and gα <dig> are expressed at low levels in taste buds, gα <dig> is expressed in a highly taste bud-selective manner. this observation is consistent with many previous reports of the ubiquitous distribution of gαq and gα <dig>  while gα <dig> is restricted to a few highly specialized cell types <cit> . further, we show that gα <dig> is limited to type ii taste cells, i.e. those that express taste gpcrs.

mammalian taste buds use specialized taste gpcrs  to detect bitter, umami and sweet tastants. both families of taste receptors activate the downstream signalling elements, plcβ <dig> and ip3r <dig> <cit> . the t2r receptors couple to gαgus <cit>  but the gα subunits activated in situ by the t1r receptors are not yet defined. whereas gαgus is substantially co-expressed with t1r receptors in the anterior taste fields, such is not the case for posterior taste fields <cit>  where only a fraction of t1r3-expressing taste cells co-express gαgus. hence, gαgus is unlikely to be the gα subunit associated with the t1r receptors in the posterior tongue. we report here the obligatory co-expression of gα <dig> with the sweet receptor t1r2+t1r <dig> in foliate and vallate taste fields. accordingly, we suggest that sweet transduction in posterior, but not anterior gustatory fields involves gα <dig>  whether gα <dig> couples directly to the sweet taste receptor or to other gpcrs intimately associated with sweet detection remains to be determined.

the different taste receptors are not homogeneous across the taste fields of the tongue but show regional differences <cit> . the t1r1+t1r <dig> umami receptor is much more prevalent in the anterior taste fields  than in the posterior lingual fields . in posterior lingual taste fields, t1r <dig> more commonly partners with t1r <dig> forming a sweet receptor. our single cell rt-pcr data show that over 70%  of the t1r3-expressing cells also express t1r <dig>  with in situ hybridization, two groups reported previously that 92% <cit>  and 98% <cit>  of the t1r <dig> expressing cells of the vallate papilla co-express t1r <dig>  the lower percentage of co-localization we report may reflect differences in technique, given the higher sensitivity of single cell rt-pcr over in situ hybridization. most of the t1r3-positive, non t1r2-expressing cells in our profiling displayed low levels of t1r <dig>  and may not have been detected with in situ hybridization.

the t1r2+t1r <dig> heterodimer can functionally couple to a variety of gαi/o subunits in heterologous systems <cit> . since sweeteners activate adenylyl cyclase in vallate taste buds <cit> , margolskee <cit>  has postulated that the t1r2+t1r <dig> receptor may couple to gαs. indeed, kusakabe et al <cit>  showed the expression of gαs, gαi <dig> and gαi <dig> in vallate taste buds, but not the tight association with sweet receptors. in contrast, our data show clearly that gα <dig>  a member of the gαq family is consistently co-expressed with t1r2+t1r <dig> in posterior taste buds. because sweet taste receptors are co-expressed with plcβ <dig> <cit> , and mice in which plcβ <dig> is knocked out show a severe deficit of sweet signaling <cit> , it is widely accepted that sweet transduction occurs via gβγ-mediated activation of plcβ <dig>  yet plcβ <dig> also can be activated robustly by members of the gαq family <cit> . our study is the first demonstration of a consistent association of gα <dig>  with taste receptors that activate plcβ <dig> 

the expression of gαgus in association with the sweet receptor in the palate and fungiform papilla is likely to account for the profound decrease of intake of sucrose and sweeteners in long-term taste behaviours in gαgus knockout mice <cit> . on the basis of these previous results along with our current findings, gαgus knockout would be predicted to affect only the palatal and fungiform taste fields where gαgus is co-expressed with the sweet receptors. transection of the gustatory nerves innervating only anterior taste fields results in near-total elimination of sweet taste preference in some behavioural assays despite the presence of an intact posterior lingual taste system <cit> . thus the loss of sweet-driven taste behaviours reported in gαgus knockouts is likely attributable to loss of function in the sweet-detecting taste buds of the anterior taste fields. indeed more rigorous behavioural analysis of gustducin null mice reveals substantial residual sweet-guided taste behavior <cit> . electrophysiological analysis of taste nerves of gαgus-null mice reveals a profound loss of sweet-evoked activity in anterior tongue but only partial loss in posterior. this is consistent with our finding that relatively few sweet receptive taste cells also express gαgus. the degree of functional loss as measured by the magnitude of the glossopharyngeal nerve response in gαgus null mice, is, however, greater than would be predicted on the basis of the co-expression patterns <cit> . perhaps gαgus-expressing sweet-receptive cells disproportionately activate gustatory nerve fibers, or act synergistically with other cells within a taste bud to effect activation of the nerve fibers. indeed, roper <cit>  suggests the likelihood of intrabud intercellular communication playing an essential role in transmission of taste information.

CONCLUSIONS
the sweet-receptive taste cells of the posterior tongue express gα <dig> while those in anterior taste buds express gαgus. these findings show that even within a single sensory system, the same receptor may couple with different g-protein alpha subunits in different functional parts of the system. our results also account for the residual behavioural and neural activity to sweet tastants in gαgus-null animals.
