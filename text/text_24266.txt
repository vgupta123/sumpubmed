BACKGROUND
cytokinins are a class of hormones that play essential roles in plant development and plant responses to the environment  <cit> . the cytokinin response pathway resembles two-component signaling mechanisms from yeast and bacteria  <cit> . the core cytokinin signaling pathway in arabidopsis involves the actions of four components: the histidine kinases , histidine phosphotransfer proteins , and two antagonistically acting classes of response regulators  that control the gene expression outputs of the pathway  <cit> . the signaling cascade starts with cytokinin binding to a chk receptor, resulting in its autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine  <cit> . the phosphate group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate residue of the receptor’s receiver domain, and then from the receiver domain to a histidine residue in a hpt  <cit> . the phosphorylated hpt relays the phosphate to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of type-b rr . phosphorylation of rrbs is thought to activate them and promote cytokinin action by up-regulating the expression of cytokinin response genes  <cit> . one class of transcriptional targets of activated rrbs are type-a rr  genes  <cit> . rras are also phosphorylated by hpts, which increases their activity and, at least for some members, decreases their degradation rate  <cit> . since rras act as cytokinin response inhibitors, their cytokinin-induced transcription combined with their cytokinin-dependent activation and stabilization leads to suppression of cytokinin action, thus limiting the strength and the duration of the cytokinin response  <cit> .

in addition to the core signaling components, the cytokinin response pathway in arabidopsis involves other positive and negative regulators. for example, arabidopsis hpt <dig>  is similar in sequence to other hpts, but lacks the conserved histidine needed for the phosphorelay. as a result, ahp <dig> acts as an inhibitor of cytokinin responses probably by causing competitive inhibition through its binding with the chks, rrbs or both  <cit> . another example is axr <dig> , a key enzyme in the related to ubiquitin  pathway of protein modification, which promotes the cytokinin response by suppressing the accumulation of the rra member arr <dig>  <cit> . the gebp  and gebp-like proteins are leucine-zipper transcription factors that promote the cytokinin response by limiting the induction of rra genes  <cit> . the cytokinin response factors  belong to the apetala2/ethylene responsive factor class of transcription factors and act in parallel to the rrbs in controlling cytokinin response genes  <cit> .

the complexity of the cytokinin signaling pathway is further increased by the existence of multigene families encoding all four core signaling components  <cit> . although the current data show that the functional redundancy within these gene families is quite extensive, there is also compelling evidence to suggest some degree of functional diversification  <cit> . to date, two types of functional diversification have been described. first, within all four gene families, members are differentially transcribed both in a tissue- and signal-specific manner, and in terms of relative abundance  <cit> . second, although proteins within each family share a high degree of identity, their diverged regions are variable enough to offer specific ligand binding affinities or participation in different cellular responses  <cit> .

the arabidopsis rrb family contains  <dig> members that belong to three phylogenetic groups  <cit> . all rrbs have a n-terminal receiver domain that includes a conserved aspartate needed for the phosphorelay, a centrally positioned myb-like dna binding domain, and a variable domain at the c-terminus which is thought to be responsible for the functional specialization within this family  <cit> . loss-of-function studies with single, double and higher-order mutants have revealed not only a high level of functional redundancy, but also that arr <dig>  arr <dig>  arr <dig> and arr <dig> control most of the cytokinin response  <cit> . other rrbs are believed to control cytokinin responses in specific tissues or at particular developmental stages. for example, arr <dig> is predominantly expressed in pollen  <cit> .

over expression of rrbs leads to cytokinin hypersensitivity, but causes minor changes in plant development  <cit> . based on the analogy with bacterial two-component systems, these observations led to the hypothesis that rrbs are expressed in their inactive forms and that cytokinin promotes the rrbs activation by phosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue. indeed, comparative analyses of protoplast expressing wild-type arr <dig> and the arr2d80n loss-of-phosphorylation mutant showed that the cytokinin-dependent induction of the rra gene arr <dig> is reduced in protoplast expressing the arr2d80n form and that a gel-mobility shift of the arr <dig> protein consistent with its phosphorylation is not detectable in the arr2d80n expressing protoplasts  <cit> . studies of two-component signaling systems in bacteria, yeast and plants have shown that a response regulator can be rendered constitutively active if the conserved aspartate is mutated into the phosphomimic residue glutamate  <cit> . indeed, when a 35s:arr2
d80e
 transgene was expressed in arabidopsis, plants were dwarfed and their rra genes were constitutively up-regulated  <cit> . the crucial role of the conserved aspartate for the activation of rrbs was also described in a study of the arr <dig> family member  <cit> . a phosphomimic substitution arr18d70e also caused a constitutive cytokinin response with respect to the transcriptional induction of primary cytokinin response genes. the effects of phosphomimic arr <dig> or arr <dig> mutations on cytokinin-regulated developmental and physiological processes were not analyzed  <cit> .

thus, the current data offer little information regarding the effects of overexpressing active, phosphorylated rrbs on intact plants and we still lack final proof that phosphorylation of rrbs is sufficient to promote all the developmental and physiological processes that characterize cytokinin response. to address this issue, we introduced the phosphomimic amino acid substitution d94e in arr <dig>  one of the major arabidopsis rrbs, and ectopically expressed the mutant protein in arr1- <dig> mutant plants. we show that arabidopsis seedlings expressing arr1d94e, but not the unmodified arr <dig>  resemble cytokinin-treated wild-type plants in a transgene dose-dependent manner. furthermore, our analyses reveal that all of the tested cytokinin responses were constitutively up-regulated in 35s:arr1
d94e
 plants. together, our results show that the arr1d94e protein is a wide-spectrum cytokinin response activator.

RESULTS
the phosphomimic d94e substitution promotes a 100-fold increase in arr <dig> activity
to compare the capacity of different arr <dig> versions to promote cytokinin responses in the absence of cytokinin treatments, we generated plants expressing wild-type arr <dig> and the phosphomimic arr1d94e in the arr1- <dig> background . based on the results of immunoblotting screens of transgenic lines, we selected two 35s:arr1
d94e
 and three 35s:arr <dig> lines for further analyses. the two phosphomimic lines contained ~5 ±  <dig> and ~14 ±  <dig> more arr <dig> compared to col- <dig> plants of the same age, and are here referred to as low  and high  expressors . the three lines expressing wild-type arr <dig> contained ~ <dig>  ±  <dig> , 18 ±  <dig> and 24 ±  <dig> more arr <dig> compared to col- <dig>  and are referred to as low  and high  expressing lines, respectively . despite similar expression levels of phosphomimic and wild-type arr <dig> in the h lines, only transgenic plants expressing phosphomimic arr <dig> had rosettes smaller than col- <dig> and arr1- <dig> . reduced rosette size is one of the characteristic developmental phenotypes associated with exogenous cytokinin treatments and cytokinin overproduction  <cit> .

inhibition of root growth is one of the most sensitive organismal responses to cytokinin  <cit> . consistent with the effect of the transgene on rosette size, roots of plants expressing phosphomimic arr <dig> were shorter than roots of arr1- <dig> plants . we also observed a dose-dependent effect of the phosphomimic arr <dig> transgene: roots of the l line were ~2-fold longer than roots of the h seedlings. the root length of plants expressing the wild-type arr <dig> was affected only in the strongest expressor line , and to a lesser extent compared to the phosphomimic arr1-expressing lines .

we next estimated the strength of the cytokinin effect caused by the ectopic expression of wild-type and phosphomimic arr <dig> versions by comparing the transgenic root lengths with those of the wild-type and arr1- <dig> plants grown on ms/ <dig> media supplemented with a range of benzyladenine  doses . the 35s:arr1
d94e
 lines showed a constitutive cytokinin response phenotype, with the l and h lines resembling wild-type seedlings treated with  <dig> nm ba and  <dig>  - 2 μm ba, respectively . in agreement with the observed decrease in cytokinin sensitivity of the arr1- <dig> mutant  <cit> , the ba concentration that promoted a similar root growth inhibition was higher . analyses of the lines expressing wild-type arr <dig> showed that only the highest expressor h <dig> had a weak constitutive cytokinin response phenotype which resembled wild-type plants grown on  <dig> nm and arr1- <dig> plants grown on  <dig> nm ba . to obtain an estimate of the difference in response activation between arr <dig> and arr1d94e, we compared the ba doses that phenocopied the root length of the h phosphomimic and the h <dig> wild-type arr <dig> lines. because the arr <dig> level in the wild-type expressor line h <dig> is higher than in the phosphomimic h line , this comparison represents an estimate of the minimal relative response activation strength of the phosphomimic arr1d94e. since phosphomimic arr <dig> h seedlings resembled the wild type grown on  <dig>  μm ba and wild-type arr <dig> h <dig> seedlings resembled the wild type on  <dig> nm ba, we concluded that the arr1d94e protein is at least 100-fold more potent in promoting this cytokinin response.

ectopic expression of arr1d94e promotes a wide spectrum of constitutive cytokinin responses
to document the extent of the constitutive response in the phosphomimic lines, we next analyzed other cytokinin-regulated traits in wild-type arr <dig> and phosphomimic arr <dig> expressing lines. first, we determined the steady-state mrna levels of two cytokinin-inducible genes. the rra gene arr <dig> is a primary cytokinin response gene and encodes an inhibitor of the cytokinin response  <cit> . the cytokinin-inducible exp <dig> gene is thought to act further downstream in the cytokinin response pathway, and it encodes a cell-wall loosening protein expansin  <dig>  <cit> . consistent with the constitutive cytokinin response phenotype, the steady-state levels of both arr <dig> and exp <dig> were up-regulated by the phosphomimic arr <dig> transgene . we observed a significant increase in arr <dig> abundance in the phosphomimic arr <dig> h line, while the exp <dig> transcript level was higher in both phosphomimic arr <dig> lines. in comparison, the expression of both cytokinin-inducible genes was not increased in the wild-type arr <dig> expressing lines .

second, we tested the root hair elongation response which is known to be promoted by exogenous cytokinin  <cit>  and increased in the cytokinin overproducer line ipt- <dig>  <cit> . both phosphomimic arr <dig> lines had a constitutive root hair elongation response which was transgene dose-dependent . in contrast, no increased root hair elongation was observed in the arr <dig> expressing lines. in agreement with the observed decrease in cytokinin sensitivity of the arr1- <dig> mutant  <cit> , the root hair length in the arr1- <dig> mutant was reduced compared to the wild type .

next we tested the cytokinin responses of transgenic lines grown in darkness. previous studies have identified two types of cytokinin growth responses in etiolated seedlings  <cit> . at an early stage of etiolated growth , cytokinin-treated seedlings have a shorter hypocotyl and an increased apical hook curvature, whereas at later stages , cytokinin-treated seedlings have swollen upper hypocotyls regions, expanded cotyledons and have developed true leaves  <cit> . the untreated wild type and arr1- <dig> seedlings did not differ from each other and displayed the expected etiolated development that is characterized by an elongated hypocotyl and small yellow unopened cotyledons . in contrast, the 35s:arr1
d94e
 plants again exhibited a constitutive cytokinin-response phenotype when grown in darkness . after  <dig> days of growth in the dark, both 35s:arr1
d94e
 lines had shorter hypocotyls and an exaggerated apical hook curvature, and resembled the cytokinin-treated wild-type and ipt- <dig> seedlings . after  <dig> weeks of growth in the dark, both the 35s:arr1
d94e
 and ipt- <dig> seedlings had expanded cotyledons, swollen upper hypocotyls regions and had formed true leaves, again resembling the cytokinin-treated wild type . contrary to the effect of exogenous cytokinin on the wild type, we did not observe a reduction in root elongation in any of the etiolated seedlings, including the cytokinin overproducer ipt- <dig> . the lines expressing the wild-type arr <dig> did not display any constitutive response phenotype either at the early or late etiolated development stages .

the fourth test we conducted is the analyses of hypocotyl and root explants responses to auxin . incubation of explants on media supplemented with particular concentration ratios of auxin and cytokinin are known to promote callus or shoot formation  <cit> . typically, a high cytokinin-to-auxin ratio will promote the formation of green calli and the occasional shoot development. in contrast, a lower cytokinin-to-auxin ratio will promote the growth of only white calli or if the ratio drops below a critical threshold, no cell proliferation at all. in theory, a constitutive cytokinin response mutant or a cytokinin overproducer would not require cytokinin in the media for callus or shoot formation. indeed, after  <dig> days of incubation on media containing only  <dig>  μm naa, hypocotyls excised from 35s:arr1
d94e
 and ipt- <dig> seedlings developed green calli . higher concentration of naa  promoted green callus and shoot formation in both phosphomimic lines and in ipt- <dig> . as expected, no cell proliferation was observed in wild-type and arr1- <dig> hypocotyls on any of the auxin concentrations tested. we also did not observe any callus or shoot induction responses in the wild-type arr <dig> overexpressing lines confirming that these lines do not have a constitutive cytokinin response . therefore, the cell proliferation response to auxin required either an increase in endogenous cytokinin or a constitutive up-regulation of arr <dig> action. because the cell proliferation and differentiation was more pronounced in the strong 35s:arr1
d94e
 compared to the weak 35s:arr1
d94e
 line, we concluded that the relative response strengths were a reflection of the difference in arr1d94e expression level. it was shown earlier that overexpression of the unmodified arr <dig> form promotes a hypersensitive cytokinin response in tissue culture and leads to the formation of green callus even in the absence of exogenous cytokinin  <cit> . by comparing the effects of similarly expressed wild-type and phosphomimic arr <dig>  we show that arr1d94e is much more potent at promoting this type of cytokinin-independent tissue culture response.

cytokinin treatments have been shown to increase the transcript levels of a number of genes encoding flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . some of the flavonoid biosynthetic genes  gene encoding the key enzyme of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway chs  <cit>  or dihydroflavonol reductase genes) were transcriptionally induced by ba, whereas the steady-state mrna levels of others  were increased via a post-transcriptional mechanism  <cit> . in agreement with the described effects of cytokinins on anthocyanin production, we found that anthocyanins accumulated to a higher level in 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings compared to the 35s:arr <dig> lines, wild type and the arr1- <dig> mutant, which contained statistically identical amounts of anthocyanins . these increases were approximately of the same magnitude as those measured in ipt- <dig> seedlings or in col- <dig> treated with 1 μm ba. the 35s:arr1
d94e
 plants accumulated more anthocyanins than the 35s:arr1
d94e
 plants, confirming that the transgene promotes cytokinin responses in a dose-dependent manner. the chs level was increased only in the 35s:arr1
d94e
  and ipt- <dig> seedlings which was in agreement with the high anthocyanin content of these lines .

cytokinins are known to inhibit leaf senescence and its hallmark symptom, chlorophyll breakdown  <cit> . it has been reported that artificially-induced chlorophyll loss caused by the incubation of detached leaves in darkness and senescence-induced chlorophyll loss are both mediated by the same mechanism  <cit> . to determine senescence progression under controlled conditions, we performed detached-leaf senescence tests and used cotyledons that are developmentally of the same age in the wild type and transgenic lines. we observed a significant senescence delay in both the 35s:arr1
d94e
 and ipt- <dig> lines when compared to the wild type and arr1- <dig> mutant . for all three lines, the senescence delay was especially clear from days  <dig> to  <dig> into the treatment . however, for this cytokinin-response, we observed no correlation between the strength of the cytokinin phenotype and the arr1d94e expression level: in contrast to the other analyzed cytokinin responses where the 35s:arr1
d94e
  line consistently had the weaker cytokinin phenotype, the 35s:arr1
d94e
  line showed the strongest senescence delay . no changes in senescence-induced chlorophyll loss were observed in any of the wild-type arr <dig> overexpressing lines or in the arr1- <dig> mutant.

finally, it has been shown that cytokinins have a role in the regulation of meristem development  <cit> . decrease in cytokinin sensitivity or content causes a decrease in shoot apical meristem  size, whereas increased cytokinin action promotes a sam size increase  <cit> . analyses of six-day-old seedlings revealed a significant sam size increase in the 35s:arr1
d94e
  line and in ipt- <dig> seedlings . no changes of the sam size were detected in seedlings overexpressing wild-type arr <dig> or in the arr1- <dig> mutant . on the other hand, a decrease in cytokinin sensitivity or content was shown previously to promote an increase in root apical meristem  size, whereas increased cytokinin action promoted a ram size decrease  <cit> . consistent with their increased cytokinin action, we observed a decrease in ram size in both 35s:arr1
d94e
 lines, while the arr <dig> overexpressing lines did not significantly differ from the wild type . in agreement with the previous reports  <cit> , we observed an increase in ram size in the arr1- <dig> seedlings . collectively, these analyses confirmed the constitutive cytokinin response phenotype of the 35s:arr1
d94e
 lines.

ethylene-dependent constitutive cytokinin responses in 35s:arr1d94e overexpressing lines
some of the effects of cytokinin on plant development are mediated by increased ethylene biosynthesis that is caused by the stabilization and thus increased activity of the key ethylene biosynthesis enzyme acc synthase  <cit> . in dark-grown seedlings, cytokinin promotes a triple response that includes an increase in apical hook curvature and an inhibition in both hypocotyl and root elongation  <cit> . in light-grown seedlings, the inhibitory effect of cytokinin on root elongation is also in part mediated by increased ethylene production  <cit> . to test if the reduced hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings is a result of increased ethylene action, we introgressed the 35s:arr1
d94e
  line into the ethylene insensitive mutant ein2- <dig> that carries a defect in a key step of the ethylene response pathway  <cit> . in light-grown seedlings, loss of ein <dig> function partially suppressed the short-root phenotype of the 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings . in contrast, ein2- <dig> completely suppressed the short-hypocotyl phenotype of etiolated 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings . a significant portion of the inhibitory effect of cytokinins on the root and hypocotyl elongation growth of young seedlings is mediated through an increase in ethylene action caused by a cytokinin-induced increase in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . it was shown earlier that this cytokinin-induced ethylene biosynthesis involves the primary cytokinin response pathway  <cit> . our results confirm this order of events by showing that the inhibitory effects of increased arr <dig> action on elongation growth is suppressed in an ethylene insensitive background. however, whereas the suppression of hypocotyl growth inhibition was complete in etiolated seedlings, we observed only a partial reversion of root elongation growth in light-grown seedlings. considering that the ein2- <dig> mutation causes a near complete ethylene resistance  <cit> , it is unlikely that the partial reversion in light-grown seedlings is caused by residual ethylene action. instead, cytokinin action probably controls root elongation via an ethylene-independent pathway. indeed, it was shown earlier that cytokinin regulates root growth by controlling the distribution of auxin that impacts the activity and size of the root meristem  <cit> .

our results with 35s:arr1
d94e
 stand in contrast to results obtained with plants expressing 35s:arr2
804e
, the phosphomimic version of arr <dig>  <cit> . in this earlier study, it was concluded that arr <dig> plays a role in the ethylene response pathway because the constitutive triple response phenotype of seedlings expressing 35s:arr2
804e
 was not suppressed by ethylene biosynthesis inhibition  <cit> . in contrast, our observation that the etiolated phenotype of 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings is fully suppressed by loss of function of the ein <dig> ethylene signaling component , indicated that the constitutive triple response of 35s:arr1
d94e
 seedlings is caused by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis which is in agreement with the well-established stimulatory role of cytokinin on acc synthase activity  <cit> . taken together, this may be yet another example suggesting that arr <dig> has a specific function in comparison to other rrbs such as arr <dig>  <cit> .

developmental changes in adult 35s:arr1d94e plants
both the 35s:arr1
d94e
 and ipt- <dig> plants remained smaller than the wild type during the early stages of adult development . however, after  <dig> days of growth, the rosette size of the 35s:arr1
d94e
  plants was increased compared to the wild type and arr1- <dig> . these larger rosettes were also visibly greener which was in agreement with the senescence delay observed with the cotyledon assay . the arr <dig> overexpressing lines and arr1- <dig> mutant had wild-type sized rosettes. the ipt- <dig> plants, which required a longer growth period to reach their final size, remained substantially smaller after prolonged growth on soil .

cytokinins are known to be involved in the regulation of shoot branching. although the hormonal regulation of shoot branching has been discovered many decades ago, new hormones that influence this process and the identities of the effectors involved are still being discovered  <cit> . because cytokinins increase the size of shoot apical meristems, and because they are known to promote the release of apical dominance when directly applied to lateral buds, it is commonly believed that cytokinins increase shoot branching  <cit> . however, the inflorescences of 35s:arr1
d94e
 plants were not visibly more branched than inflorescences of the wild type or arr1- <dig> . the length of the primary inflorescence stem was significantly increased in the 35s:arr1
d94e
  line , which is a likely consequence of the delayed senescence phenotype observed in these plants . the inflorescence of ipt- <dig> plants was substantially shorter and not more branched compared all other lines , which is in agreement with what was reported earlier for the c <dig> ecotype version of this transgenic line  <cit> . one unexpected feature of the 35s:arr1
d94e
 inflorescence phenotype was the absence of any visible increase in branching accompanied by a loss in shoot apical dominance. considering the classical role of cytokinins in promoting release of apical dominance  <cit> , one would expect that increased cytokinin action would lead to a bushier inflorescence structure. however, recent studies have shown that the down-regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis and suppression of rrbs function increase inflorescence branching  <cit> . these studies combined with our data suggest that cytokinins play a more complex role in this developmental process. however, it also remains possible that the effect of the 35s:arr1
d94e
 transgene is suppressed at this later developmental stage and that we therefore did not observe any effects on inflorescence development.

CONCLUSIONS
here we show that seedlings ectopically expressing a phosphomimic version of arr <dig> resembled the cytokinin-treated wild type, and that the relative strengths of most of the cytokinin-related phenotypes correlated with arr1d94e abundance. furthermore, we showed that the constitutive cytokinin response phenotype, which was not observed in arr <dig> overexpressing plants, is the result of a significant increase in the capacity to promote cytokinin responses in the absence of exogenous cytokinin application.

because we used the constitutive camv 35s promoter, our results do not interpret the function of the arr <dig> gene in arabidopsis development. rather, they enable us to reach two important conclusions about the arr <dig> protein. first, because the phosphomimic substitution constitutively activated the cytokinin response both at the molecular, physiological and developmental levels, we concluded that arr <dig> phosphorylation at d <dig> is indeed a key step in cytokinin signaling. the d94e substitution converted arr <dig> from a latent into an active transcription factor which is 100-fold more potent as a response activator compared to its wild-type counterpart. the second conclusion is that phosphomimic  arr <dig> has the capacity to promote most of the currently known cytokinin responses. however, it remains possible that arr1d94e does not promote cytokinin responses that were not analyzed in this study.

our results show that the 35s:arr1
d94e
 transgene mimics the effects of cytokinin treatments, and hence, validate the current model of cytokinin signaling which stresses the essential role for phosphorylation of rrbs on their conserved aspartate residue in promoting a wide-spectrum of cytokinin responses. whereas our results provide information about the arr <dig> protein and the cytokinin response pathway in general, the observation that a phosphomimic version of arr <dig> can be used as a wide-spectrum cytokinin response activator is also relevant for biotechnology and agriculture. cytokinins regulate a number of developmental processes and environmental responses that are of significance for crop yields  <cit> . so far, the engineering of cytokinin-controlled agriculturally important traits has focused predominantly on modifying cytokinin accumulation either via changes in biosynthesis or metabolism  <cit> . an alternative approach could be the use of constitutively active signaling proteins in combination with tissue or developmental stage specific promoters. based on the high level of conservation of the cytokinin response pathway in higher plant species  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that phosphomimic versions of the corresponding arr <dig> versions of crop species will be useful for the engineering of cytokinin-related traits.
