BACKGROUND
an expressed sequence tag  set surveys a cdna library for two important types of information: the transcript sequence and transcript abundance  <cit> . both of these can be obtained through est clustering, a process that identifies and assembles sibling ests   <cit> . the assembly of ests in each cluster is a partially or completely restored transcript , and the number of ests within each cluster then represents the abundance of this transcript or mrna species in the cdna library. the sequence information has greatly facilitated numerous applications in genomic research including the construction of gene indexing systems, novel gene discovery, genome annotation, snp typing, splicing detection and microarray probe design  <cit> . the transcript abundance information conveyed by the est data has been used for gene expression differentiation and gene discovery rate estimation  <cit> .

in this paper we consider multiple applications that require modeling of the expression data for inference of cdna library properties. key questions of interest include,  how many new genes can be captured in an additional sample of a targeted size based on the current est data from the same library?  how many genes are expressed in one tissue or multiple tissues given the est data? and  how many genes are co-expressed in two tissues? answers to these questions, we believe, will provide not only new clues to the diversity of expressed genes in a wide diversity of organisms that have been subject to est sequencing, but also a way to predict sequencing outcomes. for example, the overlap of expressed genes can be indicative of functional similarity of two tissues; the expected gene capture from an additional sample can be useful for budgeting future sequencing efforts.

as "expression evidence", est data already plays a crucial role in gene annotation and inference of the number of expressed genes in the transcriptome of an organism  <cit> . however two major challenges exist in direct estimation of gene capture or the total number of genes expressed in a tissue based on est data alone. the first challenge arises from est clustering error. errors from different sources can bias the number of observed genes upward by 35% – 40%  <cit> . for 5' ests, the false separation error is especially problematic; insufficient overlap between sibling ests  can explain a fraction up to 80% of these clustering errors  <cit> . in this paper, the gene cluster profile data  for 5' ests was obtained after correcting for insufficient overlap error  using the method introduced in  <cit> .

given that good data has been generated from est clustering, it remains a challenge to make accurate predictions of gene capture that will be expected in future sequencing experiments. question  was recently addressed by  <cit>  where prediction of gene capture in an additional sample of size larger than the initial sample requires parametric fitting of the transcript abundance distribution to avoid wild variability of the estimator . however an inappropriate assumption of the transcript abundance distribution  could result in systematic bias in estimation  <cit> . the performance of this approach in the est problem has yet been well established.

in this paper we propose a compound poisson process approach for accurate prediction of gene capture in est sequencing. the superior performance of the new prediction method over the existing method implemented by  <cit>  in a computer program egene is established with a simulation study. we discuss how this method can be applied to estimate the number of genes expressed in one cdna library, or co-expressed in two libraries. finally we illustrate the new prediction method with four est sets from the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana.

q <dig> ≡ q <dig> = ∫ dq, qt ≡ qt = ∫ e-λdq.

in words, q <dig> is the probability of observing at least one tag from a random gene on  <cit> , and qt is that of observing zero tags on  <cit>  but at least  <dig> tag on .

in the est problem, one focal interest is the expectation of additional distinct genes that can be captured in the time period  given the current est data. the distribution form in equation  implies that the conditional capture dt given the current sample only depends on d. more explicitly, the conditional distribution of dt|d is a binomial , and hence

the second example was generated from setting  with s =  <dig> and gene cluster profile data n =  = . the total of sampled genes was d =  <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % of n. the estimated total number of expressed genes was  <dig> with 95% bootstrap confidence interval .

the two case studies are typical among many simulations we have conducted, where the abundance distribution was highly rightward skewed and only a small fraction of the genes were captured in the initial est sample. based on our experience, we found that the bootstrap confidence interval for e always well covered the true mean e  for t ≤  <dig>  although the sr method was defined for e, it can be used to provide approximate estimates for the conditional capture e for t ≤  <dig>  but in general it cannot be recommended for t ≥  <dig>

the results in table  <dig> suggest that about  <dig> genes were present in the green silique tissue library, in contrast to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the abgr, root and flower bud cdna libraries respectively. it is possible that the green silique expressed more genes than the other three. however we lack confidence to conclude this because library screening  may cause such difference; in addition, under-estimation is likely in the latter three sets because of relatively small sample size. the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the four data sets were , ,  and  respectively, which also failed to support the significance of the difference.

for the silique data, if an additional sample of  <dig> ests  was sequenced, we would expect to capture an extra of  <dig> distinct genes. the average gene capture per est in the second sample is  <dig> . for the abgr, root and flower bud sets, this quantity  is  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the gene capture plot for the silique in figure 2a shows a concave pattern in est sample size, indicating an expected declining trend of efficiency with additional sequencing. the sequencing redundancy, defined as the average est count per gene shows a slightly convex relationship in gene capture  and a roughly linear one in est sample size . note that these four cdna libraries were generated under the same normalization protocol  <cit> ; for non-normalized libraries, the redundancy would likely have increased at a greater rate as sequencing proceeded.

now we turn to estimation of the number of genes jointly expressed or co-expressed in two pairs of tissues: silique + flower  and abgr + root . if we let d <dig>  d <dig> and d1∪ <dig> be the observed total number of genes in library  <dig>   <dig> and the pooled set, then the number of observed co-expressed genes is d1∩ <dig> = d1+d2-d1∪ <dig>  in analogy with the estimated overlap n^1∩2=n^1+n^2−n^1∪2

discussion
several important factors could affect the accuracy and precision of gene capture prediction and gene number estimation. for applications of interest here, special care must first be taken to minimize the impact of errors from different sources. a good gene cluster profile data n should reflect the true sampling distribution of the transcripts in the cdna library. we have suggested that investigators cluster 5' and 3' ests separately and then correct for errors attributable to insufficient overlap  of sibling 5' ests  <cit> . for the two 5' est sets, root and abgr, the estimates of n before and after iso error correction were  <dig> vs  <dig> and  <dig> vs  <dig> respectively . the substantial difference in n^

gene number estimation and gene capture prediction are sensitive to parametric assumptions of the transcript abundance distribution q. a bad parametric assumption could yield a wildly biased estimate. for example, the poisson-gamma model due to fisher  <cit>  has been a popular choice in species number estimation problem, under which an analytical confidence interval can be obtained. however we found this assumption can yield extremely wild bias when the true q deviates from gamma  <cit> . the egene program by sr which implements the nonparametric empirical bayes method by  <cit>  and  <cit>  has been shown unsatisfactory for prediction of additional gene capture e for t >  <dig> due to extreme variability. the negative binomial model discussed in  <cit>  and  <cit>  could potentially overcome the variability issue, however its performance has not been established in literature. we are unable to compare it with the cpp method since it is not integrated into egene.

the nonparametric maximum likelihood approach is typically robust to the form of transcript abundance distribution q. for example, the gene capture prediction method worked remarkably well when q was a log normal, exponential or gamma distribution. the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator  of q, i.e., q^

we have also demonstrated applications of the proposed method for estimating the number of expressed genes in one cdna library or genes co-expressed in two libraries. the analysis of four est data sets from normalized cdna libraries of arabidopsis thaliana disclosed a very similar concave pattern of gene capture together with a roughly linear increasing redundancy if sequencing had proceeded, both suggesting a rapid decay of sequencing efficiency. it seems to us that under-estimation is likely for n estimation if the est sample size is relatively small. however the estimated gene expression overlap of two libraries still can be very informative for the true expression similarity provided the sample size is reasonably large.

the gene number estimation can be inflated if many genes have multiple splicing forms in the expression pool. ests from different splicing forms can fall into different contigs, causing an upwardly biased frequency of small clusters. in particular, the singleton count n <dig> will be inflated  <cit> . in general the singleton count is a sensitive indicator of the rare genes. inflation of the singleton count n <dig> usually results in inflation of n^

CONCLUSIONS
we have proposed a compound poisson process model for gene capture prediction and showed its superior performance over an existing approach in estimating the unconditional capture e by monte carlo simulations. we also showed its remarkable performance in predicting the future gene capture given the current est sample. the analysis of four arabidopsis thaliana est sets showed that the number of expressed genes present in the parental cdna libraries could vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  while the fraction of co-expressed genes between two libraries can be much higher than the observed overlap. the approach can be used as a convenient, robust and reliable prediction tool in est sequencing.
