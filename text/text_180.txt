BACKGROUND
actinoplanes spp. are gram-positive aerobic bacteria growing in thin hyphae very similar to fungal mycelium  <cit> . genus-specific are the formation of characteristic sporangia bearing motile spores as well as the rare cell wall components meso- <dig> -diaminopimelic acid, l,l- <dig> -diaminopimelic acid and/or hydroxy-diaminopimelic acid and glycine  <cit> . phylogenetically, the genus actinoplanes is a member of the family micromonosporaceae, order actinomycetales belonging to the broad class of actinobacteria, which feature g + c-rich genomes that are difficult to sequence  <cit> .

actinoplanes spp. are known for producing a variety of pharmaceutically relevant substances such as antibacterial  <cit> , antifungal  <cit>  and antineoplastic agents  <cit> . other secondary metabolites were found to possess inhibitory effects on mammalian intestinal glycosidases, making them especially suitable for pharmaceutical applications  <cit> . in particular, the pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose, a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor, is used worldwide in the treatment of type- <dig> diabetes mellitus . as the prevalence of type- <dig> diabetes is rapidly rising worldwide  <cit>  an ever increasing demand for acarbose and other diabetes drugs has to be anticipated.

starting in  <dig>  the industrial production of acarbose is performed using improved derivatives of the wild-type strain actinoplanes sp. se <dig>  in a large-scale fermentation process  <cit> . since that time, laborious conventional mutagenesis and screening experiments were conducted by the producing company bayer ag in order to develop strains with increased acarbose yield. however, the conventional strategy, although very successful  <cit> , seems to have reached its limits and is generally superseded by modern genetic engineering approaches  <cit> . as a prerequisite for targeted genetic modifications, the preferably complete genome sequence of the organism has to be known. here, a natural variant representing a first overproducer of acarbose, actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> , was selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing because of its publicity in the scientific literature  <cit>  and its elevated, well measureable acarbose production of up to  <dig> g/l  <cit> . most notably, the acarbose biosynthesis gene cluster has already been identified  <cit>  and sequenced  in this strain. for most of the identified genes in the cluster, functional protein assignment has been accomplished  <cit> , presenting a fairly complete picture of the acarbose biosynthesis pathway in actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig>  reviewed in  <cit> . however, scarcely anything is known about the remaining genome sequence and its influence on acarbose production efficiency through e.g. nutrient uptake mechanisms or competitive secondary metabolite gene clusters.

we have previously reported on the obstacles of high-throughput next generation sequencing for the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , which was carried out at the center for biotechnology, bielefeld university, germany. having extensive experience in sequencing microbial genomes with classical sanger methods  <cit> ,  <dig> next generation pyrosequencing technology  <cit>  and especially with high g + c content genomes  <cit> , we were able to identify the causes for the initial actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> sequencing run to result in an unusually high number of contiguous sequences . it was found that a large number of stable secondary structures containing high g + c contents were responsible for the inability of the emulsion pcr step of the  <dig> library preparation protocol to amplify these regions. this led to their absence in the genome sequencer flx output and ultimately to the missing sequences between the contigs established by the newbler assembly software. fortunately, these problems could be solved in a second  run by adding a trehalose-containing emulsion pcr additive, and by increasing the read length  <cit> . based on this draft genome sequence, we now present the scaffolding strategy for the remaining contigs and report on the successful gap closure procedure that led to the complete finishing of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome sequence. furthermore, results from gene finding and genome annotation are presented, revealing compelling insights into the metabolic potential of the acarbose producer.

RESULTS
high-throughput pyrosequencing and annotation of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome
the complete genome determination of the arcabose producing wild-type strain actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> was accomplished by combining the sequencing data generated by paired end  and whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing strategies  <cit> . utilizing the newbler software , the combined assembly of both runs resulted in a draft genome comprising  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> , <dig> bases assembled from  <dig> , <dig> reads.

the contigs of the draft genome were analyzed for over- or underrepresentation in read coverage by means of a scatter plot to identify repeats, putative plasmids or contaminations . while most of the large contigs show an average coverage with reads, several contigs were found to be clearly overrepresented and are of special interest as discussed later. however, the majority of the unusual high and low covered contigs are of very short length, representing short repetitive elements  and contigs containing only few reads of low quality . these findings indicate clean sequencing runs without contaminations.

based on pe information,  <dig> scaffolds were constructed using  <dig> contigs with an estimated total length of  <dig> , <dig> bases . these pe scaffolds were used to successfully map terminal insert sequences of  <dig> fosmid clones randomly selected from a previously constructed fosmid library . the mapping results validated the pe scaffold assemblies and allowed the further assembly of the original  <dig> paired end scaffolds into  <dig> pe/fosmid  scaffolds due to bridging fosmid reads .

gap closure between the remaining contigs was carried out by fosmid walking  and genomic pcr technology  in cases were no fosmid was spanning the target region. genomic pcr technology was also used to determine the order and orientation of the remaining  <dig> pe/fo scaffolds. the finishing procedure was manually performed using the consed software  <cit>  and resulted in the final assembly of a complete single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with an average g + c content of  <dig> % . according to genome project standards  <cit> , the finished actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome meets the gold standard criteria for high quality next generation sequencing projects. the general properties of the finished genome are summarized in table  <dig> 

utilizing the prokaryotic gene finders prodigal  <cit>  and gismo  <cit>  in conjunction with the gendb annotation pipeline  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  protein-coding sequences  were determined on the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome . these include  <dig>  genes  with an associated functional cog category  <cit> ,  <dig>  genes  with a fully qualified ec-number  <cit>  and  <dig> orphan genes  with neither annotation nor any similar sequence in public databases using blastp search with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> . in total, the amount of protein coding genes  covers  <dig> % of the genome sequence with a significant difference of 4% in g + c content between non-coding  and coding  regions.

the complete annotated genome sequence was deposited at the national center for biotechnology information  .

general features of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome
the origin of replication  was identified as a  <dig> nt intergenic region between the two genes dnaa and dnan, coding for the bacterial chromosome replication initiator protein and the β-sliding clamp of the dna polymerase iii, respectively. the oric harbors  <dig> occurrences of the conserved dnaa box , showing remarkable similarity to the oric of streptomyces coelicolor  <cit> . almost directly opposite of the oric, a putative dif site was found. its  <dig> nt sequence 5'-caggtcgataatgtatattatgtcaact-3' is in good accordance with actinobacterial dif sites and shows highest similarity  to that of frankia alni  <cit> . in addition to the identified oric and dif sites, the calculated g/c skew  suggests two replichores composing the circular actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome .

in accordance with previous findings  <cit> , six ribosomal rna  operons were identified on the genome in the typical 16s-23s-5s order along with  <dig> trna genes determined by the trnascan-se software  <cit> . the six individual rrn operons were previously assembled into one operon ranging across seven contigs with a more than ten-fold overrepresentation . this overrepresentation might be explained by the operon's remarkably low g + c content of  <dig> % in comparison to the genome average of  <dig> %, which is typical for actinomycetes  <cit> . the low g + c content in this area may have introduced an amplification bias in favor of the rrn operon during the library preparation and thus, result in an overrepresentation of reads for this genomic region. to account for single nucleotide polymorphisms  and variable regions between ribosomal genes, all six rrn operons were individually re-sequenced by fosmid walking. the rrn operons are located on the leading strands, four on the right and two on the left replichore. interestingly, they reside in the upper half of the genome, together with a ~ <dig> kb gene cluster hosting more than  <dig> ribosomal proteins . other overrepresented large contigs were identified as transposase genes or transposon related elements .

approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the oric site, a flagellum gene cluster was found. its expression in spores is one of the characteristics discriminating the genus actinoplanes from other related genera  <cit> . the cluster consists of ~ <dig> genes spanning  <dig> kb. besides flagellum associated proteins, the cluster also contains genes coding for chemotaxis related proteins.

bioinformatic classification of  <dig>  cds with an annotated cog-category revealed a strong emphasis  on enzymes related to metabolism . in particular, actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> features an emphasis on amino acid  and carbohydrate metabolism , which is in good accordance with the identification of at least  <dig> abc-like carbon substrate importer complexes. furthermore, 16% of the cog-classified cds code for proteins involved in transcriptional processes, which suggests a high level of gene-expression regulation. this is especially relevant for the ongoing search for a regulatory element or - network controlling the expression of the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster. interestingly, the great proportion of transcriptional regulators is accompanied by a similar high percentage of proteins involved in signal transduction mechanisms , which suggests a close connection between extracellular nutrient sensing and transcriptional regulation of uptake systems and degradation pathways. comparatively, an analogous analysis of  <dig>  annotated cds from streptomyces coelicolor revealed an even higher percentage of genes coding for enzymes related to metabolism , a minor portion dedicated to signal transduction mechanisms , and a highly similar amount  of proteins involved in transcriptional processes. finally, the genome of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> reveals a striking focus  on cellular processes and signaling when compared to s. coelicolor .

besides these findings, only the genes for carbohydrate transport and -metabolism show another notable difference of more than 1% between s. coelicolor  and actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> . interestingly, 4% of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> cdss were found to be involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, a portion similar to the one found in the well-known producer s. coelicolor   <cit> . taken together, these considerations lead to a new perception of the capabilities actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> might offer, as for example, a new source of bioactive compounds. furthermore and in contrast to s. coelicolor, the genome of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> hosts significantly more genes for signal transduction proteins. this might be one key to induce the expression of acarbose and novel secondary metabolite gene clusters by appropriately composed cultivation media following the osmac  approach  <cit> . these considerations are in good accordance with empirical knowledge gathered through long lasting media optimizations .

phylogenetic analysis of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> 16s rdna reveals highest similarity to actinoplanes utahensis
an unsupervised nucleotide blast  <cit>  run of the  <dig> bp long dna sequence of the 16s rrna gene from actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> against the public non-redundant database  revealed high similarities to numerous species of the genera actinoplanes, micromonospora and salinispora. within the best  <dig> matches, the maximal dna sequence identity was in the range of  <dig> - 96%. the coverage of the query sequence varied within this cohort between  <dig> - 97%. the hits with the highest similarity, based on the number of sequence substitutions were a. utahensis imsnu 20044t  and a. utahensis ifo 13244t , both of which retrace to the type strain  a. utahensis atcc 14539t, firstly described first by couch in  <dig>  <cit> . the third hit to a. palleronii imsnu 2044t differs from actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> by  <dig> substitutions and  <dig> gaps.

based on the dna sequences of the best  <dig> blast hits, a phylogenetic tree was derived. a detailed view on a subtree contains actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> and  <dig> of the most closely related species . this subtree displays the derived phylogenetic distances between the analyzed strains, represented by their distance on the x-axis. from this analysis, it is evident that a. utahensis is the nearest species to actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> currently publicly known, followed by a. palleronii and a. awajiensis subsp. mycoplanecinus. a second analysis using the latest version of the ribosomal database project  <cit>  resulted in highly similar findings . interestingly, a. utahensis and actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> form a subcluster within the actinoplanes genus although the different isolates originate from far distant locations on different continents . in addition, it is noteworthy that actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> was renamed several times and in the early 1990s this strain was also classified as a. utahensis  <cit> .

comparative genome analysis reveals 50% unique genes in the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome
to date, seven full genome sequences belonging to the family micromonosporaceae are publicly available. using the comparative genomics tool edgar  <cit> , a gene based, full genome phylogenetic analysis of these strains revealed a phylogeny comparable to the one inferred from 16s rrna genes . for comparison, some industrially used streptomyces and frankia strains were also included in the analysis. as expected, each genus forms its own cluster. interestingly, the genera micromonospora, verrucosispora and salinispora are more closely related to each other than to actinoplanes, whereas streptomyces and frankia are clearly distinct from the whole micromonosporaceae family. based on this analysis, the marine sediment isolate verrucosispora maris ab-18- <dig> is the closest sequenced species to actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> currently publicly known with  <dig>  orthologous genes, a g + c content of  <dig> % and a genome size of  <dig>  mbases  <cit> . comparative blast analysis of conserved orthologous genes of all sequenced micromonosporaceae strains revealed prevalence for being located in the upper half of the genome, near the origin of replication . the core genome analysis revealed a total of  <dig>  genes common to all seven micromonosporaceae strains, whereas the pan genome consists of  <dig>  genes calculated by the edgar software  <cit> . an analysis of genes that exclusively occur in the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome revealed  <dig>  singleton genes .

the high quality genome sequence of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> corrects the previous sequence and annotation of the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster

the acarbose biosynthetic  gene cluster sequencing was initiated  <cit>  and successively expanded  <cit>  by classical sanger sequencing. until now, this sequence was the longest  and best studied contiguous dna fragment available from actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig>  however, with the complete, high quality genome at hand, a total of  <dig> inconsistent sites were identified in the existing acarbose gene cluster sequence . most notably, the deduced corrections affect the amino acid sequence of two genes, namely acbc, coding for the cytoplasmic 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-synthase, and acbe, translating to a secreted long chain acarbose resistant α-amylase  <cit> . because of two erroneous nucleotide insertions  in acbc , the resulting frameshift caused a premature stop codon to occur, shortening the actual gene sequence by  <dig> nucleotides. in acbe , the sequence differences are manifold, including mismatches, insertions and deletions, leading to multiple temporary frameshifts and single amino acid substitutions. such differences occur in the mid part of the gene sequence, ranging from nucleotide position  <dig> to  <dig>  these sequence corrections improved the similarity of the α-amylase domain to its catalytic domain family.

several genes of the acarbose gene cluster are also found in other locations of the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome sequence
it is known that the copy number of genes can have high impact on the efficiency of secondary metabolite production  <cit> . it is therefore worthwhile to study the genome wide occurrences of the genes encoded within the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster, particularly with regard to import and export systems and the assessment of possible future knock-out experiments.

our results show, that the acb gene cluster does not occur in more than one location within the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome. however, single genes and gene sets with equal functional annotation and amino acid sequence similarity to members of the acb cluster were found scattered throughout the genome by blastp analysis. most notably, homologues to genes encoding the first, second and fourth step of the valienamine moiety synthesis of acarbose were found as a putative operon with moderate similarities of 52% , 35%  and 34% . furthermore, one homologue for each of the proteins acba  and acbb  was identified. in the arcabose gene cluster, acba and acbb are located adjacent to each other , and catalyze the first two sequential reactions needed for the formation of dtdp-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, another acrabose essential intermediate  <cit> . it is therefore interesting to note that the identified homologues to acba and acbb were also found adjacent to each other in the context of a putative dtdp-rhamnose synthesis cluster . in mycobacterium smegmatis, the orthologous dtdp-rhamnose biosynthetic gene cluster codes for mandatory proteins rmlabcd, involved in cell wall integrity and thus, cell survival  <cit> . further genome analysis detected the abc-transporters acpl3214-acpl <dig> and acpl5011-acpl <dig> with moderate similarity  to the acarbose exporter complex acbwxy. both operons resemble the gene structure of acbwxy consisting of an abc-type sugar transport atp-binding protein and two abc-type transport permease protein coding genes. therefore, considering that abc-transporters often present a promiscuous substrate-specificity, it is possible that these structurally similar transporters also be involved in acarbose transport. acpl <dig>  a homologue with high sequence similarities to the alpha amylases acbz  and acbe  was found encoded within the maltose importer operon malefg. for the remaining acb genes only weak  or no similarities  were found outside of the acb cluster by blastp searches using an e-value threshold of e- <dig> 

in contrast to previous findings  <cit> , the extracellular binding protein acbh, encoded within the acbgfh operon , was recently shown to exhibit high affinity to galactose instead of acarbose or its homologues  <cit> . this implicates that acbgfh does not directly belong to the acarbose cluster as was proposed by the carbophore hypothesis, which indicates that acarbose or acarbose homologues can be reused by the producer  <cit> . in order to search the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome for a new acarbose importer candidate, the gacgfh operon of a second acarbose gene cluster identified in streptomyces glaucescens gla.o has been used as query  <cit> . gach was recently shown to recognize longer acarbose homologues but exhibits only low affinity to acarbose  <cit> . however, the search revealed rather weak similarities towards the best hit operon acpl5404-acpl <dig> with gach showing 26% identity to its homologue acpl <dig>  a consecutive search of the extracellular maltose binding protein male from salmonella typhimurium, which has been shown to exhibit high affinity to acarbose  <cit> , revealed 32% identity to its male homologue in actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig>  despite the low sequence similarities, these findings suggest that acarbose or its homologues are either imported by one or both of the above mentioned importers, or that the extracellular binding protein exhibits a distinct amino acid sequence in actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> and can therefore not be identified by sequence comparison alone.

the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome hosts an integrative and conjugative element that also exists in multiple copies as an extrachromosomal element
actinomycete integrative and conjugative elements  are a class of mobile genetic elements possessing a highly conserved structural organization with functional modules for excision/integration, replication, conjugative transfer and regulation  <cit> . being able to replicate autonomously, they are also said to mediate the acquisition of additional modules, encoding functions such as resistance and metabolic traits, which confer a selective advantage to the host under certain environmental conditions  <cit> . interestingly, a similar aice, designated pacpl, was identified in the complete genome sequence of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> . its size of  <dig>  kb and the structural gene organization are in good accordance with other known aices of closely related species like micromonospora rosario, salinispora tropica or streptomyces coelicolor .

most known aices subsist in their host genome by integration in the 3' end of a trna gene by site-specific recombination between two short identical sequences  within the attachment sites located on the genome  and the aice , respectively  <cit> . in pacpl, the att identity segments are  <dig> nt in size and attb overlaps the 3' end of a proline trna gene. moreover, the identity segment in attp is flanked by two  <dig> nt repeats containing two mismatches: gtcacccagttagtaccag. these exhibit high similarities to the arm-type sites identified in the aice psam <dig> from strepomyces ambofaciens. for psam <dig> it was shown that the integrase binds to these repeats and that they are essential for efficient recombination  <cit> .

pacpl hosts  <dig> putative protein coding sequences . the integrase, excisionase and replication genes int, xis and repsa are located directly downstream of attp and show high sequence similarity to numerous homologues from closely related species. the putative main transferase gene tra contains the sequence of a ftsk-spoiiie domain found in all aices and streptomyces transferase genes  <cit> . spda and spdb show weak similarity to spread proteins from frankia sp. cci <dig> and m. rosaria where they are involved in the intramycelial spread of aices  <cit> . the putative regulatory protein pra was first described in psam <dig> as an aice replication activator  <cit> . on pacpl, it exhibits high similarity to an uncharacterized homologue from micromonospora aurantica atcc  <dig>  a second regulatory gene reg shows high similarities to transcriptional regulators of various streptomyces strains whereas the downstream gene nud exhibits 72% similarity to the amino acid sequence of a nudix hydrolase from streptomyces sp. aa <dig>  in contrast, mdp codes for a metal dependent phosphohydrolase also found in various frankia and streptomyces strains.

homologues to the remaining genes are poorly characterized and largely hypothetical in public databases although aice <dig> is also found in various related species and shows akin to aice <dig>  aice <dig>  aice <dig>  aice <dig>  and aice <dig>  high similarity to homologues from m. aurantiaca. interestingly, homologues to aice <dig> and aice <dig> were only found in m. aurantiaca, whereas aice <dig>  aice <dig>  aice <dig>  aice <dig>  aice <dig>  and aice <dig>  seem to solely exist in actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> 

based upon read-coverage observations of the aice containing genomic region, an approximately twelve-fold overrepresentation of the aice coding dna sequences has been revealed . as only one copy of the aice was found to be integrated in the genome, it was concluded that approximately eleven copies of the element might exist as circular, extrachromosomal versions in a typical actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> cell. however, the number of extrachromosomal copies per cell might be even higher, as it is possible that a proportion of the aices was lost during dna isolation. it should also be noted that the rather low g + c content of the aice  might have introduced a similar amplification bias during the library preparation as discussed above for the rrn operons. nevertheless, these findings are of great interest, as they demonstrate the first native functional aice for actinoplanes spp. in general and imply the possibility of future genetic access to actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> in order to perform targeted genetic modifications as done before for e.g. micromonospora spp.  <cit> . the newly identified aice may also improve previous efforts in the analysis of heterologous promoters for the overexpression of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin in actinoplanes friuliensis  <cit> .

four putative antibiotic production gene clusters were found in the actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> genome sequence
bioactive compounds synthetized through secondary metabolite gene clusters are a rich source for pharmacologically relevant products like antibiotics, immunosuppressants or antineoplastics  <cit> . besides aminoglycosides, the majority of these metabolites are built up in a modular fashion by using non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  and/or polyketide synthases  as enzyme templates . briefly, the nascent product is built up by sequential addition of a new element at each module it traverses. the complete sequence of modules may reside on one gene or spread across multiple genes in which the order of action of each gene product is determined by specific linker sequences present at proteins' n- and c-terminal ends  <cit> .

for nrpss, a minimal module typically consists of at least three catalytic domains, namely the andenylation  domain for specific amino acid activation, the thiolation  domain, also called peptidyl carrier protein  for covalent binding and transfer and the condensation  domain for incorporation into the peptide chain  <cit> . in addition, domains for epimerization , methylation  and other modifications may reside within a module. oftentimes a thioesterase domain  is located at the c-terminal end of the final module, responsible for e.g. cyclization and release of the non-ribosomal peptide from the nrps  <cit> .

in case of the pkss, an acyltransferase  coordinates the loading of a carboxylic acid and promotes its attachment on the acyl carrier protein  where chain elongation takes place by a β-kethoacyl synthase  mediated condensation reaction  <cit> . additionally, most pkss reduce the elongated ketide chain at accessory β-kethoacyl reductase , dehydratase , methyltransferase  or enoylreductase  domains before a final thioesterase  domain mediates release of the polyketide  <cit> .

modular nrps and pks enzymes strictly depend on the activation of the respective carrier protein domains , which must be converted from their inactive apo-forms to cofactor-bearing holo-forms by a specific phosphopantetheinyl transferase   <cit> . the genome of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> hosts three such enzyme encoded by the genes acpl <dig>  acpl <dig>  and acpl <dig> 

in actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig>  one nrps , two pks  and a hybrid nrps/pks cluster  were found by gene annotation and subsequent detailed analysis using the antismash pipeline  <cit> . the first of the identified gene clusters  contains four nrps genes , hosting a total of ten adenylation , thiolation  and condensation  domains, potentially making up  <dig> modules. thereof, three modules are formed by intergentic domains, which suggests a specific interaction of the four putative nrps enzymes in the order nrps1a-b-d-c. such interaction order is the only one that leads to the assembly of all domains into  <dig> complete modules -  <dig> minimal modules  and one module containing an additional epimerization domain. these considerations were corroborated by matching linker sequences, named short communication-mediating  domains  <cit> , found at the c-terminal part of nrps1d and the n-terminal end of nrps1c. furthermore, this cluster shows high structural and sequential similarity to the smc <dig> gene cluster identified on the pscl <dig> megaplasmid from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc  <dig>  <cit> . however, in smc <dig> a homolog to nrps1d is missing, which leads to the speculation that nrps1d was subsequently added to the cluster as an additional building block. in fact, leaving nrps1d out of the assembly line would theoretically still result in a complete enzyme complex built from  <dig> instead of  <dig> modules. based on the antismash prediction, the amino acid backbone of the final product is likely to be composed of the sequence: ala-asn-thr-thr-thr-asn-thr-asn-val-ser . besides the nrpss, the cluster also contains multiple genes involved in regulation and transportation as well as two mbth-like genes, known to facilitate secondary metabolite synthesis. in this regard, it is noteworthy that the occurrence of two mbth genes in a secondary metabolite gene cluster is exceptional in that it has only been found once before in the teicoplanin biosynthesis gene cluster of actinoplanes teichomyceticus  <cit> .

the type- <dig> pks-cluster cacpl_ <dig>  hosts  <dig> genes putatively involved in the synthesis of an unknown polyketide. the sum of the pks coding regions adds up to a size of ~ <dig> kb whereas all encoded pkss exhibit 62-66% similarity to pkss from various streptomyces strains. however unlike the nrps-cluster, no cluster structurally similar to cacpl_ <dig> was found in public databases. analysis of the domain and module architecture revealed a total of  <dig> elongation modules  including  <dig> β-kethoacyl reductase  and  <dig> dehydratase  domains as well as a termination module . however, an initial loading module  could not be identified in the proximity of the cluster. to elucidate the most likely build order of the polyketide, the n- and c-terminal linker sequences were matched against each other using the software sbspks  <cit>  and antismash. remarkably, both programs independently predicted the same gene order: pks1e-c-b-a-d.

just  <dig> kb downstream of cacpl_ <dig>  a second gene cluster  containing a long pks gene with various accessory protein coding sequences could be identified . it shows some structural similarity to a yet uncharacterized pks gene cluster of salinispora tropica cnb- <dig> . besides the  <dig> elongation modules identified on pks2a, no other modular type  <dig> pks genes were found in the proximity of the cluster. however, genes downstream of pks2a are likely to be involved in the synthesis and modification of the polyketide, coding for an acyl carrier protein , an acp malonyl transferase , a lysine aminomutase, an aspartate transferase and a type  <dig> thioestrase. especially type  <dig> thioestrases are often found in pks clusters  <cit>  like e.g., in the gramicidin s biosynthesis operon  <cit> . the presence of discrete acp, mat and two additional acetyl coa synthetase-like enzymes is also typical for type  <dig> pks systems  <cit>  although no ketoacyl-synthase  and chain length factor  was found in this cluster  <cit> .

another  <dig> kb downstream of cacpl_ <dig> a fourth secondary metabolite cluster  was located . it hosts both  <dig> nrps and  <dig> pks genes and may therefore synthesize a hybrid product as previously reported for bleomycin from streptomyces verticillus  <cit> , pristinamycin iib from streptomyces pristinaespiralis  <cit>  and others  <cit> . n- and c-terminal sequence analysis of the two cluster types revealed the gene orders nrps2b-c-a and pks3a-b-c as most likely. the prediction of the peptide backbone of the nrps cluster resulted in the putative product dehydroaminobutyric acid -cys-cys. one could speculate that the pkss are used prior to the nrpss as nrps2a comes with a termination module . however, two additional monomeric thioesterase  and one enoylreductase  domain containing genes do also belong to the cluster and may be involved in the termination and modification of the product. notably, all three nrps genes show high similarity  to genes from an uncharacterized cluster of streptomyces venezuelae atcc  <dig> whereas the pks genes exhibit highest similarity  to genes scattered in the methylosinus trichosporium ob3b genome.

the four newly discovered secondary metabolite gene clusters broaden our knowledge of actinomycete nrps and pks biosynthesis clusters and represent just the tip of the iceberg of the manifold biosynthetical capabilities - apart from the well-known acarbose production - that actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> houses. it remains to be determined if all presented clusters are involved in industrially rewarding bioactive compound synthesis and how these clusters are regulated, because none of these metabolites were identified and isolated so far. these new gene clusters may also be used in conjunction with well-studied antibiotic operons, in order to synthesize completely new substances, as recently performed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the establishment of the complete genome sequence of the acarbose producer actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> is an important achievement on the way towards rational optimization of the acarbose production through targeted genetic engineering. in this process, the identified aice may serve as a vector for future transformation of actinoplanes spp. furthermore, our work provides the first sequenced genome of the genus actinoplanes, which will serve as the reference for future genome analysis and sequencing projects in this field. by providing novel insights into the enzymatic equipment of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig>  we identified previously unknown nrps/pks gene clusters, potentially encoding new antibiotics and other bioactive compounds that might be of pharmacologic interest.

with the complete genome sequence at hand, we propose to conduct future transcriptome studies on actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> in order to analyze differential gene expression in cultivation media that promote and repress acarbose production, respectively. results will help to identify potential target genes for later genetic manipulations with the aim of increasing acarbose yields.
