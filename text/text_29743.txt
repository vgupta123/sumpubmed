BACKGROUND
the brown ghost knifefish  is a weakly electric teleost fish belonging to the taxonomic order gymnotiformes. this species has been widely studied over the past several decades as a model system in a variety of disciplines within biology and neuroscience, with particular focus on the ionic and neuromodulatory regulation of neural oscillations  <cit> , neural control of communication via electric signals  <cit> , and central nervous system  regeneration  <cit> .

most research involving this species has addressed diverse aspects of their nervous system. as all other species of the family apteronotidae, a. leptorhynchus generates electric discharges using a neurogenic electric organ, formed by modified axonal terminals of spinal motoneurons  <cit> . the electric organ discharge is used for orientation and object detection in close vicinity of the fish  <cit> , and for communication with conspecifics  <cit> . knifefish are able to sense both their own electric discharges and electric signals of other biological and non-biological sources through electroreceptors distributed on the skin  <cit> . the neural structures involved in the processing of behaviorally relevant electrosensory information, and in the motor control of the electric organ discharges, are among the best characterized brain and spinal cord systems of any non-mammalian vertebrate, thus establishing a. leptorhynchus as a significant model of neuroethology  <cit> .

these neuroethological investigations have yielded an extensive body of information on the structure and function of the cns of a. leptorhynchus, including the first neuroanatomical atlas of the brain of any teleost species  <cit> . this knowledge base has, in turn, encouraged the use of the brown ghost knifefish as a model organism in several other biological disciplines, including developmental neurobiology and regenerative biology. for example, the availability of a brain atlas enabled the first comprehensive mapping of adult-born cells in the whole brain of any vertebrate species  <cit> , establishing a. leptorhynchus as a major teleostean model system for the study of adult neurogenesis  <cit> , and informing similar mappings of the stem cell niches in the adult brain of zebrafish   <cit>  and the mozambique tilapia   <cit> . utilization of this model has provided substantial insight into the cellular mechanisms that underlie the generation, migration, and differentiation of adult-born cells in various regions of the cns  <cit> . recently, a. leptorhynchus has been introduced to the area of aging research as the first vertebrate model system exhibiting negligible brain senescence  <cit> .

like many other teleost fish studied thus far, apteronotids have a remarkable capacity for regeneration after cns injury, a property which has been connected to the high levels of adult neurogenesis occurring throughout the life of fish  <cit> . adult neurogenesis and neuroregeneration have been studied extensively both in the brain and in the spinal cord of brown ghost knifefish. studies using proteomic analysis in conjunction with brain lesion paradigms have contributed to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics triggered by injury and subsequent regeneration  <cit> .

the unique neurogenic origin of the electric organ in apteronotids greatly facilitates the correlation of structural regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injuries, by allowing instantaneous non-invasive monitoring of the activity of newly formed spinal electromotor neurons. thus, the spinal cord of brown ghost knifefish has proven to be a useful model both for understanding spontaneous regeneration of the cns and for assessing the effectiveness of experimental manipulations aimed at improving natural recovery in regeneration-competent organisms  <cit> .

despite the extensive use of apteronotids as model systems, there are currently no large-scale genomic resources for any species of this family. several studies have used molecular cloning and sequencing to determine partial or complete sequences of less than two dozen proteins, mostly transmembrane ion channels and receptors  <cit> , but also synaptic scaffold proteins  <cit> , enzymes  <cit> , and homeobox genes  <cit> . the addition of new, detailed sequence information on a large scale is required for the development of better tools to be used in the study of the cns in knifefish.

the present investigation describes the de novo assembly and annotation of the a. leptorhynchus cns transcriptome based on sequencing datasets derived from illumina-based sequencing-by-synthesis. results are presented for libraries prepared from both the brain and the spinal cord of ten adult male and female knifefish. translation of a subset of transcript open reading frames was experimentally validated by shotgun proteomics.

RESULTS
given the lack of a reference a. leptorhynchus genome, we adopted a de novo assembly and annotation strategy to evaluate assembly quality and interpret results . since complete genome sequences are available for a number of fish species, this existing information can be used to examine the quality of the presented de novo assembly, and to annotate it. such genomic information is currently available for two species of pufferfish, the japanese pufferfish , the first vertebrate genome to be released after the human one  <cit> , and the spotted green pufferfish   <cit> ; as well as for the medaka   <cit> ; the atlantic cod   <cit> ; the three-spined stickleback   <cit> ; the zebrafish   <cit> ; the southern platyfish   <cit> ; and, recently, the coelacanth   <cit> . out of all teleost fish with complete genomes available, the only species that belongs to the same phylogenetic superorder  and subdivision  as a. leptorhynchus, is d. rerio  <cit> . similarly, d. rerio is the species most closely related to a. leptorhynchus, according to established phylogenetics, for which a complete reference proteome sequence set is available. we therefore preferentially used the genomic and proteomic information available from d. rerio as a reference for sequence comparison and for de novo transcriptome annotation in a. leptorhynchus. this approach further allowed us to leverage the power of several bioinformatics tools often only available for the core model species.figure  <dig>

d. rerio
reference proteome. a. rna was extracted from brain and spinal cord tissue of adult a. leptorhynchus, fragmented and barcoded, and strand-specific cdna libraries were created for illumina sequencing. reads were trimmed using several strategies and then normalized in silico prior to de novo assembly with trinity. transcript reconstruction was performed using several strategies and then benchmarked using blast to maximize transcripts aligning to a d. rerio reference proteome. the best assembly was then further annotated. b. out of the transcripts from the entire a. leptorhynchus assembly with any alignment to a d. rerio reference protein, most transcripts aligned to <40% of the reference d. rerio proteins. c. when filtering the assembly for transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  the relative proportion of transcripts with less than complete alignments was reduced. d. when selecting the assembly transcript with the longest d. rerio alignment within a given contig, this greatly reduced the relative proportion of less than complete alignments. e. this distribution was preserved when considering only transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  f. out of the entire assembly, more than half of the transcripts had at least some alignment to a reference d. rerio sequence. similarly, more than half of the sequences with fpkm ≥  <dig> aligned to a d. rerio protein sequence. g. using only transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  nearly 60% of the reference d. rerio proteome had at least one assembly transcript with an alignment , which represented approximately 80% of the d. rerio sequences that were hit by the entire assembly .



de novo transcriptome assembly
strand-specific cdna libraries were prepared from cns tissues  of  <dig> adult male and female a. leptorhynchus. final raw read counts included  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> bp paired-end reads passing filter on an illumina miseq platform, and  <dig> , <dig>  <dig> bp paired-end reads passing filter obtained using an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. these reads were combined and then assembled using trinity  <cit> . after optimizing parameters for trimming and transcript reconstruction , an assembly with ~ <dig>  unique contigs, including ~ <dig>  m total isoforms, was produced. of these,  <dig>  contigs contained at least a partial protein-coding sequence based on alignment to a reference set of known actinopterygii protein sequences. as many as  <dig>  of these contigs contained full or near-full length  unique protein sequences , thus providing broad coverage of the a. leptorhynchus proteome. in general, we used blast alignment of transcripts  to reference protein sets as a means of assessing coding transcript completeness. transcripts with ≥ 80% sequence coverage  are thus considered “full or near-full length”.

trimming optimization
as part of optimizing our de novo assembly, we compared the effect of read trimming on de novo transcriptome assembly. read trimming strategy affects assembly quality and can impact downstream analysis, with the best tradeoff between read loss and dataset quality dependent upon the dataset itself as well as research goals  <cit> . for trimming reads prior to assembly, we evaluated no trimming, “soft” trimming, where 3’ adapter sequences present from insert read-through during sequencing were removed as well as leading and trailing bases that were uncalled  or with low quality , and “hard” trimming, where, in addition to the “soft” trimming criteria, a sliding window was used to eliminate bases that fall below a threshold quality . in either of the trimmed read sets, trimmed sequences shorter than 35 bp were also removed before further analysis, as well as reads that became unpaired because of this. prior to assembly, these trimmed read sets were pooled and normalized using the in silico normalization script packaged with trinity, in order to remove highly redundant sequences and reduce assembly computational time. the trimmed, normalized read sets were then assembled with trinity using the default settings for strand-specific, paired-end read sets, including a 200 bp minimum transcript length . trinity produces transcripts that are assigned to ‘genes’ , with each gene set potentially corresponding to multiple transcripts derived from the same genomic loci . here, we refer to unique trinity “components” as “contigs”, where a single contig can include a set of multiple sequence variants.

in order to compare quality of assembly methods and permit further optimization, we blastx searched  a d. rerio reference proteome  obtained from uniprotkb, which contained non-redundant sequences from both swissprot and trembl. relative to the total number of protein sequences in this d. rerio reference proteome set, similar coverage was achieved regardless of trimming strategy, although the “soft” trimming strategy provided a minor advantage over “hard” trimming, recovering  <dig> % more transcripts with at least 80% sequence coverage  . it has been reported that while the aggressive quality-based trimming strategy is common, a gentler strategy can favor increasing sensitivity of transcript reconstruction during de novo assembly  <cit> .

regardless of trimming strategy, each raw assembly was considerably large, with ~ <dig>  contigs and ~ <dig>  m total isoforms per assembly. whereas these values were similar to the numbers observed using comparable methods  <cit> , they are larger than more reasonable estimates of loci achieved with other datasets  <cit> . this may be due to incomplete contiguous transcript reconstruction of low-expressed transcripts, resulting in multiple  contigs per locus, as well as contamination and transcriptional noise. we attempted to determine whether the size of the assembly could be further limited, while retaining coverage of the d. rerio proteome, by evaluating different strategies for transcript reconstruction.

transcript reconstruction optimization
with the goal of minimizing excessive alternative transcript reconstruction, we evaluated several reconstruction methods in trinity. aside from the default trinity transcript reconstruction method, butterfly  <cit> , we considered butterfly in “extended lock” mode, which favors more conservative transcript reconstruction resulting in fewer isoforms. in addition, cufffly, an implementation of the cufflinks assembly algorithm  <cit>  that finds the minimum number of isoforms that capture the variation in the reads, and pasafly, an implementation of the pasa  assembly algorithm  <cit>  adapted for butterfly transcript graphs, were also evaluated, as these methods generally tend to produce even more conservative isoform reconstructions. while the alternative transcript reconstruction methods reduced the overall number of transcripts in the assembly, they produced similar number of overall contigs . despite similar number of contigs overall, the default  transcript reconstruction did provide some enhanced sensitivity, with  <dig> % more sequences aligned than the next best reconstruction method  .

overall, while many contigs remained unassigned at this initial level of annotation, the identification of contigs with sense alignments covering ≥80% of  <dig> d. rerio protein sequences indicated that the assembly was of substantial quality  despite being limited to libraries prepared from only the cns of a. leptorhynchus. the large number of assembly contigs with only partial alignments suggested that higher coverage could be achieved with additional libraries from other tissues.

full sequence coverage enrichment amongst highly expressed transcripts
from the assembly produced by the least stringent but most sensitive butterfly method, the number of isoforms per contig followed a power law, with many contigs having few isoforms and a few contigs having many  isoforms . however, after filtering for transcripts with number of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  ≥  <dig>  the approximate equivalent of  <dig> transcript per cell  <cit> , the number of transcripts per contig was reduced to a log distribution, where even though many contigs had multiple isoforms, the number of isoforms was on the order of 10’s . in terms of transcript length, the overall assembly had a n <dig> of 2539 bp . however, when considering only the longest transcripts per assembly contig, the distribution shifted to an n <dig> of 940 bp , suggesting that the larger n <dig> calculated from the entire assembly  was due to longer contigs having many long isoforms assembled by trinity. after filtering for transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  the n <dig> was 2093 bp , with a more consistent  n <dig> of 1995 bp  after considering only the longest transcript per contig . thus, when considering only contigs with isoforms that had an fpkm ≥  <dig>  the overall distribution of transcript size was improved.

out of all  <dig>  transcripts from the assembly  with an alignment to a d. rerio reference protein, most transcripts aligned to <40% of the respective protein . when filtering the assembly for transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  the relative proportion of transcripts with less than complete alignments was reduced . when selecting only the longest aligned transcript per contig, the relative proportion of shorter alignments was reduced , suggesting many assembly transcripts within a contig group contained partial open reading frames . this distribution was preserved when considering only the longest aligned transcript per contig that also had an fpkm ≥  <dig> . out of the entire assembly, more than half of the transcripts had at least some alignment to a reference d. rerio sequence. likewise, more than half of the sequences with fpkm ≥  <dig> aligned to a d. rerio protein sequence . using only transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>  nearly 60% of the reference d. rerio proteome had at least one assembly transcript with an alignment , which represented ~80% of the d. rerio sequences that were hit by the entire assembly .

enrichment of sequences aligning to closely related fish species
d. rerio has become one of the dominant model fish species in developmental biology, and leveraging the high quality annotation developed for this fish species makes it an attractive dataset to build from in annotating the a. leptorhynchus transcriptome. however, as described earlier, genomic studies of several fish species exist, leading to several “complete” reference proteomes being established. to assess the relative applicability of various well-characterized fish species’ sequence data, we aligned the assembly to a well-annotated proteome sequence set consisting of seven species, including d. rerio, the nile tilapia , x. maculatus, g. aculeatus, o. latipes, t. rubripes, and t. nigroviridis. while the overall number of transcripts with significant alignments increased in this expanded sequence set, the majority of highest identity protein-coding sequences in the a. leptorhynchus transcriptome were found to align to sequences from d. rerio , consistent with known phylogenetic relations between these fish species  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  contigs had sense alignments that covered ≥ 80% of an actinopterygii protein sequence .table  <dig>

to investigate the quality of the a. leptorhynchus assembly by alignment to a broader set of transcript sequences, the assembly sequences were blastn searched against the entire ncbi nt sequence set . sorting the blastn results by species showed an overwhelming representation of fishes, with the best represented species being the characiform astyanax mexicanus , followed by the well-characterized cypriniform d. rerio . this finding is not surprising given that these two species belong to the same taxonomic superorder, ostariophysi. on the other hand, one would have expected more hits to the a. leptorhynchus assembly among two other ostariophysans, the siluriforms ictalurus punctatus  and ictalurus furcatus . however, this result is likely influenced by the relative abundance of the high-quality sequences available for both d. rerio and a. mexicanus  <cit> .figure  <dig>

transcriptome coverage assessment and enrichment analysis
to provide a detailed view of the coverage of the assembly in terms of diversity of protein-coding transcripts assembled, we examined the percent of genes covered by gene ontology  categories based upon existing annotation from d. rerio . using a generic set of go-slim categories, we evaluated both the set of d. rerio protein sequences that were covered at least 80% by a sense-aligned a. leptorhynchus assembly sequence, as well as the set of d. rerio proteins that had any significant alignment to a. leptorhynchus assembly sequences . while the set of d. rerio genes with at least partial alignments indicates that over 90% of genes in any given go class have been identified, it remains possible that some of these incomplete alignments could be spurious or misassembled artifacts. thus, the coverage of the more fully resolved genes can be considered a more accurate read-out of the a. leptorhynchus assembly coverage. overall transcriptome coverage was balanced across major structural and functional categories. notably, in terms of cellular components, the ribosome had the highest percentage  of transcripts that were full or near-full length. this was also observed when looking at the percentage of contigs covered in major pathways from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

the moderate-to-low coverage of many genes can be partially attributed to tissue/life stage-specific and/or weakly expressed gene transcripts. to test this hypothesis, we used the zebrafish expression ontology of gene sets , a tool that determines which anatomical structures are overrepresented in a given input gene set  <cit> . indeed, when examining enrichment of adult d. rerio genes that had over 80% sequence coverage by a. leptorhynchus assembly transcripts, a variety of nervous system-related terms, including central nervous system, spinal cord, optic tectum, epiphysis, etc., were significantly enriched . by contrast, the set of d. rerio sequences with low-to-no sequence coverage in the a. leptorhynchus assembly were significantly enriched for various other anatomical terms, including components of the reproductive and skeletal systems as well as the heart. this method of classification could be used in future analyses to help prioritize tissues for library preparation and sequencing to further expand transcriptome coverage.table  <dig>

to assess which molecular categories were most highly expressed among those transcripts of the a. leptorhynchus assembly that aligned to ≥80% of a reference d. rerio protein, assembly transcripts were first ranked by fpkm, and the go classification for the corresponding d. rerio genes was used to determine enrichment of the most highly expressed transcripts using gorilla  <cit> . gorilla uses the variable enrichment thresholding method of minimum hypergeometric scoring to determine go enrichment from ranked gene lists, with significantly enriched go categories found on average in the top  <dig> % of genes . when considering the relative expression levels of transcripts with full or near-fully resolved orfs, structural components of the ribosome and factors involved in translation were found to be most prominent , consistent with the observation that the ribosome was the cellular component that had the highest percentage of well-resolved genes. expression of transport-related genes was also observed to be enriched, which is consistent with a similar analysis performed after the de novo assembly of the black-faced blenny  transcriptome  <cit> .figure  <dig>

previous cloning and characterization of a. leptorhynchus genes included characterization of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors  <cit> , hoxa paralogs  <cit> , early growth response- <dig>   <cit> , voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels  <cit> , forkhead box transcription factors  <cit> , trp channels  <cit> , and glutamate decarboxylases  <cit> . all  <dig> a. leptorhynchus protein sequences deposited in uniprot had at least a partial sequence in the assembly . of note, the sequence of hoxa13b was determined to be extended to completion here based on identification of a stop codon, as well as a start codon that aligned to the start of multiple homologous sequences from related species including d. rerio and the channel catfish , a member of the order siluriformes more closely related phylogenetically to a. leptorhynchus .figure  <dig>

identification of non-coding rna  expression and antisense transcripts
the importance and complexity of ncrnas have attracted increasing attention over the last decade. numerous classes of ncrna are now known to be important modulators of gene expression, involved in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological and developmental processes  <cit> . in the cns, ncrnas are tightly regulated, and appear to play prominent roles in developmental processes such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation  <cit> , which continue throughout adult life in a. leptorhynchus  <cit> .

to investigate ncrna present in the a. leptorhynchus assembly, we compared assembly transcripts to a reference d. rerio ncrna dataset  with blastn , focusing our analysis on several major ncrna classes including ribosomal rna , microrna , small nuclear rna , small nucleolar rna , long non-coding rna , and antisense rna to protein-coding genes.table  <dig>

note that some transcripts were found to align to multiple categories, such as the case of transcripts containing protein-coding orfs as well as a pri-mirna sequence. *ncrna was identified from d. rerio reference  except for rrna identified with rnammer and lncrna from  <cit> .



while our library preparation protocol was designed to limit the presence of rrna, two contigs were found to align to d. rerio 5s and  <dig> s rrna, with two additional contigs corresponding to mitochondrial rrna. using an additional rrna prediction tool, rnammer  <cit> , four additional contigs were designated as  <dig> s rrna .

a total of  <dig> of the a. leptorhynchus assembly contigs were aligned to  <dig> mirna transcripts from d. rerio. out of these,  <dig> a. leptorhynchus assembly transcripts aligned to ≥80% of the corresponding d. rerio mirna. many of these alignments to mirna sequences were included into longer assembly transcripts, which had portions that aligned to d. rerio protein sequences, suggesting that these transcripts likely included precursor mirnas , transcribed in conjunction with adjacent protein coding sequences  <cit> .

thirteen putative snrna were identified, including all five snrna components of the spliceosome , as well as u <dig> and u <dig> minor spliceosomal rna. also detected was 7sk small nuclear rna , the rna component of the 7sk snrnp involved in the control of transcription elongation and in the regulation of pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . the rna component of the signal recognition particle , a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein that targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes  <cit> , was also detected, with  <dig> % identity across  <dig> % of the corresponding d. rerio transcript.

seventeen transcripts aligned to snorna, a family of rna which guide chemical modification  of nascent rrna to generate mature rrna  <cit> . amongst the snorna identified were  <dig> methylation-associated c/d-box class snorna and  <dig> pseudouridylation-associated h/aca-box class snorna.

a total of  <dig> sequences of the a. leptorhynchus transcriptome showed significant alignment to known d. rerio long intergenic non-coding rna , including two sequences that covered >90% of the corresponding d. rerio lincrna. while sequence coverage was generally low, alignments to > <dig> nucleotides with close to 80% identity were found.

to further investigate the presence and conservation of lncrna expressed in adult cns tissues of a. leptorhynchus, the assembly was searched against an additional set of lncrnas expressed in adult d. rerio, including many with specific expression in the brain. lncrnas have been shown to be expressed with high tissue specificity, in particular in the brain  <cit> , where they have been associated with the control of neuronal diversification and specification  <cit> . kaushik et al. reported a set of  <dig> novel lncrnas, including  <dig> specifically expressed in adult d. rerio brain when compared with heart, liver, muscle, and blood  <cit> . amongst these, we found evidence for at least one conserved lncrna expressed exclusively in the brain , as well as  <dig> additional lncrnas found in adult d. rerio brain and other tissues examined, and finally  <dig> lncrnas that were not observed in the brain previously, but were found in blood. it is possible that these transcripts could be novel, functional lncrna. however, further investigation will be required to exclude the possibility of contamination from remaining blood vessels in the isolated brain tissue.

antisense transcription contributes to the complexity of expression dynamics, and while antisense transcripts can play roles in regulating translation and splicing, separating functional antisense transcripts from transcriptional noise remains a challenge. out of the  <dig> antisense sequences in the available d. rerio ncrna reference set, only  <dig> had significant alignments  to transcripts from  <dig> contigs in the a. leptorhynchus assembly, with significant alignments ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. expression of thousands of antisense transcripts was found to be conserved across humans, mice, and rats, although to a lesser degree than protein-coding genes  <cit> . the relatively low coverage of antisense transcripts from d. rerio may be due to lack of sufficient sequencing depth or to the restriction of our analysis to rna expressed in adult cns tissue.

detection of protein-coding orfs and putative protein-coding gene duplications
to determine the overall protein-coding potential of transcripts in the a. leptorhynchus assembly, regardless of their alignment to known actinopterygii protein sequences, protein-coding orfs were predicted from the assembly using transdecoder  <cit> , both with and without biasing “best” orf calling towards orfs with a recognizable domain in the pfam protein families database  <cit> . when limiting the set of orfs from each search to only those comprising at least  <dig> amino acids, the resulting distributions of orf lengths were similar overall, regardless of whether or not pfam domains were used for guiding orf selection . similarly, filtering for transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig> had little effect on orf size distribution without pfam , suggesting that resolution of the distribution of orf lengths of  <dig> amino acids or greater was independent of expression levels. blast aligning orfs with or without guidance from pfam against the d. rerio reference sequence demonstrated that the pfam option did slightly increase identification of orfs with conserved protein coding sequences . out of the approximately  <dig>  a. leptorhynchus transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig>   <dig>  transcripts with orfs comprising at least  <dig> amino acids  aligned to d. rerio protein sequences. transcripts with fpkm values ≥  <dig> covered a total of  <dig>  unique d. rerio proteins, or over 80% of the identifiable sequences . when transcripts with fpkm values <  <dig> were included, this coverage increased to  <dig>  unique d. rerio sequences, indicating that even transcripts expressed at low levels could still provide recognizable sequences. an additional  <dig>  transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig> contained orfs of over  <dig> amino acids that did not align to a d. rerio protein in our reference sequence set. however, after blast aligning these orfs against the entire ncbi non-redundant  protein sequence database,  <dig>  additional sequences had significant alignments --  <dig>  of these alignments were to sequences from teleostei species  showing a similar trend to the results from the nt sequence set, including  <dig>  a. mexicanus sequences and  <dig> d. rerio sequences absent from the uniprot reference set.

in order to identify potential a. leptorhynchus duplicated genes , we examined instances where multiple distinct assembly contigs were aligned to the same d. rerio protein. only sufficiently large contigs, with transcripts that could be aligned to at least 80% of a given d. rerio protein sequence, were selected. using this threshold, we observed a 1: <dig> correspondence between assembly contigs and unique d. rerio proteins for  <dig>  sequences. there were  <dig> instances of two contigs aligning to the same d. rerio protein, and  <dig> instances of three or more contigs aligning to the same d. rerio protein .figure  <dig>

one example of multiple distinct a. leptorhynchus assembly contigs aligning to the same d. rerio protein is ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> d <dig>  , in which case four a. leptorhynchus assembly contigs aligned to one known d. rerio protein. in this case, the four sequences are generally well conserved, including the cysteine active site. a more divergent example is the uncharacterized d. rerio protein a2bhk <dig>  where four a. leptorhynchus assembly contigs had substantially different alignments at the termini . several examples of multiple contigs aligning to the same d. rerio protein sequence included proteins with multiple coding genes such as calmodulin, a ca2+ binding protein involved in mediating a variety of cellular responses to variations in ca2+ levels  <cit> , which is coded for in six separate loci of the d. rerio genome, and seven assembly contigs of the a. leptorhynchus cns .table  <dig>

to exclude the possibility that contigs we assigned as putative duplicated genes  are the result of artifactual contig splitting by trinity, we compared at the nucleotide level the orfs of the  <dig> contigs assigned as having a single duplication . aligning the orfs of these pairs of contigs, we observed substantially different sequences at the nucleotide level , with sequence identity ranging from a maximum of 87% and minimum of 34%. such a high dissimilarity between two orf sequences suggests these contigs derive from different genomic loci. that both sequences produce significant alignments covering > 80% of the same target protein sequence  suggests that these contigs are both: 1) full or near-full length; and 2) encode related protein products.

validation of putative protein coding regions via shotgun proteomics analysis of the a. leptorhynchus cns
to confirm translation of assembly orfs, including alternative isoforms of particular contigs, and to demonstrate the usefulness of the assembly for increasing peptide assignments during tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we characterized protein extracts harvested from a. leptorhynchus brain and spinal cord by shotgun proteomics. two sample preparation methods, the popular in-gel digest  <cit> , and the recently introduced enhanced filter-aided sample preparation method  <cit>  , were used. tissue samples from both brain and spinal cord were used in order to broaden and enhance our coverage of the cns proteome. base peak chromatograms across a 4-hr gradient  revealed a complex mixture of digest peptides .figure  <dig>

to analyze tandem mass spectrometry data, we used mascot, which utilizes probability-based scoring in order to match tandem mass spectra to protease digest peptides predicted from a given sequence database  <cit> . in mascot, limiting the reference database size, as occurs when searching only the appropriate genus and species, increases probability-based scoring and leads to a greater percentage of statistically significant identifications. alternatively, including more sequences, for example incomplete fragments, such as those found in our assembly, or proteins from other organisms that may not have been covered in the present assembly, could increase the total number of protein ids, but may negatively impact scoring based on adjustments due to database size. we therefore considered several approaches when preparing our assembly as a sequence database for mascot, including using only long orfs , only orfs from transcripts with fpkm values ≥  <dig>  or all orfs regardless of size, and compared these results to results obtained using available sequences of d. rerio, as well as other actinopterygii sequences, from ncbi.

notably, any orf set derived from the a. leptorhynchus assembly provided the most assignments at both the peptide and protein level when compared with the results from other existing databases. the results were compared using several different false discovery rates  . as many as  <dig>  proteins were identified  with the conservative 1% fdr from the database containing all assembly orfs . within mascot-assigned “protein families”, similar protein sequences identified from a given database are grouped together. these groups can include paralogous sequences  and alternatively spliced variants. when comparing the mascot protein families with annotations from blast results, there was good agreement between the mascot assigned protein families and known paralogues identified from alignment with d. rerio. for example, the first protein family assigned by mascot included twelve orfs from the a. leptorhynchus assembly that corresponded, after blast searching, to multiple isoforms of alpha tubulin, including tuba1a, tuba1c, tuba8l, tuba8l <dig>  tuba8l <dig>  and tuba8l <dig>  likewise, the second protein family assigned by mascot included  <dig> orfs from the a. leptorhynchus assembly that all aligned to beta tubulin isoforms. the  <dig>  proteins identified  from the database containing all assembly orfs were grouped by mascot into  <dig>  protein families.

limiting the number of sequences in the database  did not benefit the probabilistic assignment of tandem mass spectra, and including more sequences, such as partial and low-expression sequences, was not observed to be a limiting factor. including shorter and less abundant transcripts from the a. leptorhynchus assembly helped in peptide assignment. in the present study, short orfs identified through proteomics often represented terminal fragments of transcripts that were not fully assembled .

after matching the final list of identified orfs from the a. leptorhynchus proteomics dataset with blast results from d. rerio, we examined the coverage of various go categories. consistent with the transcriptome assembly described above, the ribosome was the best-covered cellular component by proteomics, with peptides being assigned to nearly 40% of the protein constituents of the ribosome . in terms of molecular function, we observed the highest coverage of structural molecules, as well as antioxidant proteins, reflecting mainly the prominence of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes .figure  <dig>

a powerful benefit of combined transcriptomics and proteomics is the ability to confirm translation of alternatively spliced transcripts through the detection of splice junction peptides  <cit> . for example, within the spectrin family, which contained nine orfs that were identified by proteomics, including spta <dig>  sptb, sptbn <dig>  sptbn <dig>  there were two assembly orfs derived from different transcript isoforms within the same contig, both aligned to d. rerio spta <dig>  these two orfs, with lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, and both assigned as complete sequences based on transdecoder, were identical except for the addition sequence tavtketcsvsvrmkqveel, present after amino acid q <dig>  comparison of ms/ms sequence coverage confirmed the identification of unique splice junction peptides from each sequence . overall, there were  <dig> contigs identified in the proteomics results that had  <dig> or more isoforms with non-redundant orfs identified , although manual inspection of ms/ms for putative splice junction peptides is necessary to rule out false positives.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study represents the first major collection of transcriptomics data for a species of the order gymnotiformes, weakly electric fish from south and central america with great relevance for neurobiological research. previously, only nineteen a. leptorhynchus mrna sequences were publically available. with our de novo assembly of the adult a. leptorhynchus cns transcriptome, broad coverage of protein-coding sequences was achieved, with as many as  <dig>  contigs presenting full or near-full length orfs. our study provides the first survey of a broad variety of ncrna in a. leptorhynchus, including mirna, snrna, snorna, and other ncrna sequences. shotgun proteomics confirmed translation of orfs from over  <dig>  transcripts, including alternative splice variants. our de novo transcriptome-to-proteome analysis contributes to the growing trend of incorporating these two techniques for enhancing shotgun proteomics identifications while confirming orf assignment from transcriptome assembly experiments.

a. leptorhynchus is an important model organism in particular for the study of fundamental neurobiological aspects, such as adult neurogenesis, neuronal regeneration, and the neural basis of behavior. the availability of a targeted cns reference transcriptome will provide novel molecular tools to explore the underlying cellular mechanisms of such phenomena. in addition, the sequence information provided here can be employed to study phylogenetic relationships and various aspects of cns evolution in vertebrates. future studies, using libraries from different tissues and developmental stages, will further improve the quality and applicability of the a. leptorhynchus assembly.
