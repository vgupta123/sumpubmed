BACKGROUND
the ribosome, which plays an important role in the translational mechanism, is universal to all organisms. mammalian ribosomes consist of four rna species and  <dig> ribosomal proteins   <cit> . more than  <dig> pseudogenes of rp genes are present in the human genome  <cit> , and this has made it difficult to gain an overview of this gene family. however, we have already constructed a ribosomal protein gene database   <cit>  that contains the genomic dna and full-length cdna sequences. rpg also includes information on the transcription start sites, amino acid sequences encoded, and intron/exon structures, which has made it possible to conduct more systematic and detailed analyses of the rp genes from nine different eukaryotes.

in past studies, the control mechanisms of gene expression and rp functions were believed to be identical  <cit> . for example, most rp genes have common promoters  <cit>  and were therefore assumed to have a unified control mechanism for gene expression  <cit> . encoded amino acid and synonymous codon compositions  <cit>  and g+c content  <cit>  are also known to be similar in all rp genes. however, at this point it is unknown how many rp genes share typical features or which genes have specifically unique features.

in contrast, the protein structure and transcription mechanisms of individual rp genes have come to be gradually clarified through experimental investigation. in escherichia coli, most rp genes are crucial for ribosome assembly, such as for the proteins implicated in the bridges between two subunits , contact with trna , and the surrounding polypeptide exit channel   <cit> . the presence of gc boxes  <cit>  and binding sites for nuclear respiratory factor  <dig>   <cit>  and yin and yang  <dig>   <cit>  as transcription factor binding sites have been confirmed experimentally in the relevant rp genes in mammals. the binding site for activator protein  <dig>  has been found in the downstream region of the transcription start site  of entamoeba histolytica rpl <dig>  <cit> . a canonical tata box is lacking near the tss of the rp genes  <cit> . in addition, rps have been found to have functions other than translation. it has been reported that rps3a controls cell growth and apoptosis  <cit> . rpl13a controls translation silencing by itself  <cit> . diverse rp gene expression control in specific tissues has also been reported using expressed sequence tag  databases for humans  <cit>  and catfish  <cit> . investigation of the features of each rp gene has come to be one of the most important tasks in elucidating gene function, but few studies to date have used large-scale analysis to focus on the features of rp genes. we systematically analyzed the homogeneity and heterogeneity of rp genes on the basis of their expression profiles, promoter structures, encoded amino acid compositions, and codon compositions. we then attempted to extract the rp genes whose features differed from the set of typical features.

RESULTS
expression profile
to investigate whether each rp gene expression pattern was identical, we performed cluster analysis with a large gene expression dataset . the rp gene expression patterns were classified into four classes; main cluster, sub-cluster  <dig>  sub-cluster  <dig> and the remaining  <dig> genes, which did not belong to any of these clusters , based on both the dendrogram generated by treeview  <cit>  and their expression patterns similarities. original data files  to allow a reproduction of these clusters with dendrogram using the software treeview have been made available . the main cluster contained  <dig> rp genes, of which  <dig> encoded large subunit and  <dig> small subunit proteins, corresponding to 73% of the rp genes analyzed. these genes were relatively highly expressed in spleen, fetal brain, and lnd. furthermore, two translation initiation factor subunits , both essential genes for translation machinery, were also present in the main cluster . sub-cluster  <dig> consisted of rplp <dig> and rplp <dig>  which were highly expressed in lnd, keratinocytes, and skin. sub-cluster  <dig> contained rps15a, rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rplp <dig>  which were expressed in skin, fetal brain, and spleen. sub-cluster  <dig> was located nearer to sub-cluster  <dig> than to the main cluster. eleven rp genes  did not belong to any of these clusters. however, the expression patterns of rps <dig>  rps <dig>  and rpl <dig> were similar to that of the translation initiation factor eif3s <dig>  the translation elongation factor eef1g, the putative translation initiation factor sui <dig>  and the ribosome associated membrane protein ramp <dig>  furthermore, to investigate whether these  <dig> rp genes were expressed highly in different tissues than the other rp genes, we performed grubbs' test using mrna expression data . rpl <dig> was expressed more highly than the other rp genes in heart, skeletal muscle, uterus, small intestine, adipose tissue, fibroblasts, and liver. nine of the  <dig> rp genes were highly expressed in tissues different from those showing the high levels of expression of the other rp genes. although differentially expressed rp genes have been reported in humans  <cit> , we demonstrated other rp genes with specific expression patterns. bortoluzzi et al.  analyzed expression profiles using the number of ests in unigene  <cit> . on the other hand, our data was based on gene expression levels as measured by rt-pcr.

prediction of transcription factor binding sites
we investigated the commonality and specificity of transcription initiation factors in the rp gene family by observing transcription factor binding sites . because our prediction was supported by phylogenetic footprinting between human and mouse, we expected that the candidates might possess higher reliability. four promoters – nrf- <dig>  gc box, yy <dig>  and ap- <dig> – had already been demonstrated to have transcriptional activity in rp genes  <cit> . we found  <dig> binding sites for nrf- <dig> in  <dig> rp genes . most of the binding sites were located - <dig> bp to + <dig> bp from the tss. eighty gc boxes were found in  <dig> rp genes in upstream regions from - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp. thirty binding sites for yy <dig> were found in  <dig> rp genes in downstream regions from + <dig> bp to + <dig> bp. there were  <dig> binding sites for ap- <dig> in  <dig> rp genes in upstream regions from - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp. on the other hand, only nine rp genes had tata boxes, and seven  of these were predicted to have tata boxes between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp from the tss in the upstream region. nine rp genes had binding sites for all transcription factors. twenty-nine rp genes had binding sites for three transcription factors,  <dig> had binding sites for two, and  <dig> had binding sites for one . all rp genes were found to contain at least one transcription factor binding site. these data indicate that the common transcription factor binding sites in the rp genes were the gc box and the binding sites for nrf- <dig>  yy <dig>  and ap- <dig>  in addition, we tried to find unknown transcription factor binding sites other than nrf- <dig>  gc box, yy <dig>  and ap- <dig> in the upstream regions of ribosomal protein genes. however, although a number were found, we did not consider them as actual sites, because we could not observe any specificity of these candidates for the rp genes.

amino acid composition
we analyzed the amino acids encoded by rp genes and classified the genes into groups by a clustering method. we performed cluster analysis using  <dig> human rp genes and  <dig> genes selected randomly from refseq  <cit>  . the rp genes were divided into four classes: main cluster, sub-cluster  <dig>  sub-cluster  <dig>  and others, based on both the dendrogram generated by treeview and the similarities of amino acid composition. sixty-two rp genes were present in the main cluster. rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> were present in sub-cluster  <dig> and rps <dig>  rpl36a, rpl <dig>  rpl37a, and rpl <dig> were present in sub-cluster  <dig>  rpsa, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rplp <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> did not belong to any of these clusters.

the average frequencies of lysine  and arginine  were highest of all the amino acids in the rps. lysine and arginine are basic amino acids. the frequencies of lysine and arginine in the main cluster proteins were higher than those of the other  <dig> amino acids. the frequencies of lysine and arginine in the proteins encoded by rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> of sub-cluster  <dig> were lower than their average frequencies in the proteins encoded by main cluster genes.

the average frequencies of tryptophan , cysteine , histidine  and methionine  were lowest of all the amino acids in rps. tryptophan, cysteine and methionine are neutral amino acids. this tendency was demonstrated more potently in proteins encoded by sub-cluster  <dig> genes and less so in proteins encoded by sub-cluster  <dig> genes.

synonymous codon composition
to evaluate which rp genes had come under similar selective pressure in the evolutionary process, we performed cluster analysis of the synonymous codon composition using the  <dig> human rp genes and  <dig> genes randomly selected from refseq . we found that the codon composition of the rp genes was divided into four classes , based on both the dendrogram generated by treeview and the similarities of codon composition. fifty-nine rp genes belonged to the main cluster. in these rp genes the frequencies of aag, cag, atc, gag, cac, and ctg were higher than those of any other codons. rps3a, rps4y, rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> were present in sub-cluster  <dig>  rps4x, an isoform of rps4y, belong to the main cluster, although they have similar amino acid composition.

in these rp genes the frequencies of gat, gaa, cag, aag, gct, act, and cat were higher than those of any other codons. rpsa, rps <dig> rpl <dig> rps <dig> rps <dig> rps27a,rpl <dig> rpl <dig> rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> were present in sub-cluster  <dig>  the frequencies of aag, cag, tat, gaa, gtt, att, gat, aat, cac, and ctg were higher than those of any other codons.

aag and cag were frequently observed in all three clusters. the high frequency usage of these codons may be a common feature of rp genes. codons with g or c in the third codon position were observed frequently in the main cluster, distinguishing the main cluster from sub-cluster  <dig> and sub-cluster  <dig>  furthermore, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig> rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> did not belong to any cluster.

forty-nine rp genes in the main cluster on synonymous codon composition analysis also belonged to the main cluster on amino acid composition analysis. nine rp genes belonged to the main cluster in terms of only the amino acids encoded. seventeen rp genes belonged to the main cluster in terms of only synonymous codon composition.

discussion
bodymap expression profile data
the available human bodymap data obtained from the website  <cit>  was already normalized in  <dig> human tissues. we downloaded all the data from the website and treated all of the data equally.

to evaluate the accuracy of our expression profile analysis, we made a comparison of bodymap expression profile data with mouse microarray data  <cit> , downloaded from gene expression omnibus   <cit> . this mouse microarray data included  <dig> rp genes, and we observed one large rp gene cluster consisting of  <dig> genes in the expression profiles. we were also able to find a further  <dig> genes which did not belong to the cluster. fifty-three of  <dig> rp genes in the mouse microarray data are included in the human bodymap data. in both datasets,  <dig> of  <dig> rp genes belong to the main cluster and  <dig> of  <dig> rp genes did not. therefore, the classification of more than  <dig> %  of the genes with rp gene expression patterns was consistent between the two clustering analyses. although the number of genes, species, type of tissues, and clustering method are different in the production of these two datasets, the classification of more than 60% of the rp genes was correspondence. since the microarray data was measured by the ratio of the hybridization signal for each gene, it could vary by factors of  <dig> or greater. for such reasons, the expression level of each gene could not be compared. on the other hand, as the bodymap data was measured with pcr-based expression profiling method, it does indicate the relative concentration of gene transcripts in  <dig> human tissues. therefore, tissue specific rp gene expression pattern can be determined by the bodymap data . a similar bioinformatics approach the rp gene expression pattern has been performed by bortoluzzi et. al.  <cit> . however, as their data was prepared from the public database unigene, i.e., using assembled est data recorded by many researchers, these data was not collected under the same conditions. they were able to observe specific rp gene expression patterns, but not rp genes with similar expression patterns. on the other hand, as our prepared bodymap data was measured under the same condition by one laboratory team , we consider that bodymap data to be suitable for cluster analyses of the rp genes. for a better understanding of the bodymap data, we have provided the original data files .

features of the major rp genes
from the results of our four analyses  we created a list of  <dig> human rp genes in rank order to form a "feature index"  . at least  <dig> rp genes with a fi of less than  <dig>  in the list can be regarded as containing the features of the major rp genes. on the other hand, we consider rp genes with high fi scores to be specific rp genes.

the feature index  is a quantitative measure of the heterogeneity in an individual rp gene. expression profile, amino acids encoded, and synonymous codon composition: a value of  <dig> was given to genes that did not belong to the main cluster. tata box: a value of  <dig> was given to genes that had tata boxes. common promoter: the maximum value was set as  <dig> , because no obvious clusters were found for the analysis of promoter prediction. then, if a binding site for one of four common transcription factors , gc boxes , yin and yang  <dig> , and activator protein  <dig> ) was found, a value of  <dig>  was subtracted. the columns "expression profile cluster", "amino acid encoding cluster", and "synonymous codon frequency cluster" indicate the clusters to which rp genes were assigned as a result of each analysis. m: main cluster; s1: sub-cluster 1; s2: sub-cluster 2; o: other. the column "tata box" indicates the existence of a tata box, y: yes, n: no. for example, fi  <dig>  of rplp <dig> was calculated as follows; + <dig>  , + <dig>  , + <dig> , + <dig>  , + <dig>  - <dig>  .

the features of the major rp genes gradually became clear to us from the four analyses. we were thus able to make the following four points in relation to typical features.  in the spleen, lnd, and fetal brain the major rp genes are highly expressed; the control mechanism of regulation in these tissues might be different at the post-transcription level as reported in previous study  <cit> .  major rp genes have gc boxes and possible binding sites for nrf- <dig>  yy <dig>  and/or ap- <dig>  however, they do not have canonical tata boxes. the ap- <dig> transcription factor is mainly composed of jun, fos and atf protein dimers, which are thought to regulate the processes of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and transformation  <cit> . their activity was confirmed in entamoeba histolytica rpl <dig>  <cit>  and their homologues were confirmed in mammals. moreover, since their consensus sequence of the human ap- <dig> binding site  was similar to that of entamoeba histolytica rpl <dig>  <cit> , the existence of the ap- <dig> transcription factor binding sites can also be putatively accepted in human rp genes. though analyzed in detail, we observed no clear relationship between the results of the expression profile analysis and promoter prediction.  the major rp genes show a characteristic encoded amino acid composition of high lysine and arginine content. rps, which interact with rrna in the ribosome complex, has been suggested to have many arginines and lysines on the surface.  major rp genes show a characteristic synonymous codon composition with a high rate of g or c in the third codon position and a high content of aag, cag, atc, gag, cac, and ctg. it is believed that the species and number of trnas in the genome influence the compositional bias for codon selection  <cit> .

although the features noted here for the major rp genes were what had already been believed in general, these results confirm the major features of the rp genes within a whole set. moreover, our results have revealed that rp genes that do not belong to the major groups do exist among the  <dig> rp genes; the unique features of these genes should prove useful to the field for the course of further study.

features of specific rp genes
at least  <dig> rp genes with a fi score of greater than  <dig>  can be regarded as specific rp genes. their unique features are listed in table  <dig> and discussed in detail in the following sections.

amino acid composition was unique.
the feature index  is a quantitative measure of the heterogeneity in an individual rp gene. expression profile, amino acids encoded, and synonymous codon composition: a value of  <dig> was given to genes that did not belong to the main cluster. tata box: a value of  <dig> was given to genes that had tata boxes. common promoter: the maximum value was set as  <dig> , because no obvious clusters were found for the analysis of promoter prediction. then, if a binding site for one of four common transcription factors , gc boxes , yin and yang  <dig> , and activator protein  <dig> ) was found, a value of  <dig>  was subtracted. the columns "expression profile cluster", "amino acid encoding cluster", and "synonymous codon frequency cluster" indicate the clusters to which rp genes were assigned as a result of each analysis. m: main cluster; s1: sub-cluster 1; s2: sub-cluster 2; o: other. the column "tata box" indicates the existence of a tata box, y: yes, n: no. for example, fi  <dig>  of rplp <dig> was calculated as follows; + <dig>  , + <dig>  , + <dig> , + <dig>  , + <dig>  - <dig>  .

rplp <dig>  rplp <dig>  rplp2
animals, insect, fungi and protozoans possess three classes of acidic ribosomal p proteins: rplp <dig>  rplp <dig> and rplp <dig>  <cit> . it is reported that the heterodimers of rplp1α/rplp2β and rplp1β/rplp2α form stalk in the 60s large subunit with rplp <dig> in the yeast  <cit> . on the other hand, the heterodimer of rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> form stalk in the silkworm  <cit> . p protein complex binds to the gtpase domain of rat  <dig> s rrna in a buffer containing mg2+  <cit> . it is also known that phosphorylated p proteins interact with elongation factor ef- <dig> in the rat  <cit> .

interestingly, rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> have their own specific characteristics on both expression profiling and amino acid composition by our analyses. in our expression profile, rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> were highly co-expressed in lnd and keratinocytes, forming a sub-cluster. as only rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> form dimers in the silkworm, they may have gene expression machinery different from those of the other rp genes. in addition, they also belonged to the same sub-cluster in the study of encoded amino acid composition. in this cluster, the average frequencies of encoded lysine and arginine were lower than for the main rp genes, indicating a possible cause for the rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> location "stalk" in the ribosome complex. although the p protein conformation is constructed from three proteins, interestingly, rplp <dig> did not belong to the main cluster or sub-cluster  <dig>  in either the expression profile or amino acid composition studies. rplp <dig> was predicted to have a tata box in the upstream region of tss. therefore, this may indicate that rplp <dig> is a specific gene not only for p proteins but also for the rp gene family. on the other hand, because all three p protein genes belonged to the main cluster in the study of synonymous codon composition, evolutionarily they might have been affected by selective pressure on codon usage along with other rp genes. from these results, we conclude that rplp <dig>  rplp <dig>  and rplp <dig> are unique and specific genes compared with the major rp genes, but that these p protein genes are members of the rp gene family.

rpl41
rpl <dig> was one of the rp genes with higher specificity . the coding sequence  size of human rpl <dig> was shortest  among all the rp genes, the average size being  <dig> bp. human rpl <dig> was independent from the main cluster in terms of the encoded amino acid composition  and synonymous codon composition , although we applied codon usage data less affected by amino acid composition  <cit> . on the specificities of synonymous codon composition, we calculated the gc <dig> level  in light of the suggestion that the short length of rpl <dig> could have biased the synonymous codon composition. the average gc <dig> level in human rp genes was  <dig> %. in contrast, the gc <dig> level of rpl <dig> was  <dig> %, the lowest of all the rp genes. therefore, it is likely that the specificities of synonymous codon composition was scarcely affected by biased amino acid composition, or by the shortness of rpl <dig>  but rather, was solely affected by differential evolutionary pressure unlike the other rp genes. removal of yeast rpl <dig> did not affect the ratio of  <dig> s to  <dig> s subunits, but it did reduce the amount of  <dig> s, suggesting that rpl <dig> was involved in ribosomal subunit association  <cit> . as rpl <dig> is known to be dispensable in yeast  <cit> , we consider it possible that human rpl <dig> also helps solely in association with ribosomal subunits. although human rpl <dig> is known as one of the rp genes, our data indicates that it may not be a typical rp gene.

other specific rp genes
the fis of rpsa, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl36a were higher than those of the other rp genes. some of these rp genes had specificity in terms of the amino acids encoded, with lower frequencies of encoded lysine , arginine , or both . in addition, rpl <dig> contains an array of  <dig> repeats of the trinucleotide gct that encodes a polyalanine tract in the 3'-flanking sequence. as this polyalanine is conserved only in humans and mice, this characteristic sequence would seem to have been inserted in rpl <dig> during the evolution of these species. rps <dig> did not belong to any cluster in either the expression profile or the encoded amino acid composition study. moreover, it was predicted not to have the four typical promoters, but to contain the tata box. interestingly, it was found to belong to the main cluster in the study of synonymous codon composition, indicating that rps <dig>  like the other rp genes, was affected by selective pressure on codon usage during the course of evolution. consequently, these specificities suggest that these rp genes may have functions in addition to translation of which we are not yet aware.

conserved regions in mouse rp genes
conserved regions with lengths of over  <dig> bp were found in regions upstream of the tss in the following rp genes: rps <dig>  rps4x, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig> rps <dig>  rps27a, rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl27a, rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl35a, rpl36a, rpl <dig>  and rplp <dig>  most importantly,  <dig> rp genes were found to have conserved upstream regions of over  <dig> bp adjacent to the tss. conserved intronic regions with lengths of over  <dig> bp were found in rps <dig> rps <dig> rps <dig> rps <dig> rps <dig> rpl <dig> rpl <dig> rpl23a, and rpl <dig>  moreover, there were no transcription factor binding sites in rps <dig> and rpl23a, suggesting that these intronic regions were conserved because of the existence of the following characteristics:  specific regulatory elements;  small nucleolar rnas , a type of non-coding rna;  repetitive elements such as transposons; and  unidentified alternative exons. we confirmed that the conserved intronic region in rps <dig> contains snorna, which functions in box c/d 2'-o-methylation, from + <dig> bp to + <dig> bp  <cit> . for this reason, these conserved regions are likely to have certain biological functions.

synonymous codon bias in rp genes
in e. coli, schizosaccharomyces pombe, and caenorhabditis elegans, the synonymous codon is highly biased according to the trna-gene copy numbers  <cit> . on the other hand, in drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens, codon composition is influenced largely by the number of gc-dinucleotides, rather than by the selective pressure on codon usage attributable to the number of trnas  <cit> . furthermore, in higher vertebrates such as humans, a major factor contributing to codon usage is the variation in the long-range gc level, the isochore  <cit> . we conducted principal component analysis only for the rp genes in e. coli, methanococcus jannaschii, saccharomyces cerevisiae,c. elegans, d. melanogaster, and h. sapiens with codon usage data, called relative adaptiveness   <cit> . the results indicated homogeneity of codon composition in the rp genes of e. coli, m. jannaschii, s. cerevisiae, and c. elegans . therefore, most of the rp genes in these species were affected by translational selection. on the other hand, heterogeneity of codon composition was observed in the rp genes of d. melanogaster and h. sapiens  <cit> . these results are also consistent with the results of our cluster analysis of codon composition; many rp genes  did not belong to the main cluster . these results imply that the number of rp genes affected by different selective pressures increased gradually during the evolutionary process from prokaryote to human. because higher eukaryotes may have gained several factors such as the isochore, the influence of codon bias has become weaker with evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
each rp is a part of a huge rnp complex. until recently, rp genes were suggested to have a unified control mechanism for transcription and translation. in this study, human rp genes show the following heterogeneity:  rp genes show a divided cluster for their gene expression level and some rp genes show tissue-specificity;  each rp gene is controlled by different regulators;  the optimal amino acids are different in some rp genes;  the optimal codon are different in some rp genes. these results demonstrate that rps have individual characteristics. it can be suggested that certain rp genes have the potential to carry out extra-ribosomal functions as independent polypeptides.

this study to the best of our knowledge is the first attempt to investigate the overall trends in human rp genes. we anticipate elucidating the detailed functions of the rp genes in the future.
