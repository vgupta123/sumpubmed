BACKGROUND
postharvest losses can have a significant impact on crops, ranging from  <dig> to as high as 50% of total production  <cit> . citrus is one of the most economically important fruit crops in the world and it is particularly susceptible to postharvest damage because harvested fruits are usually stored before they reach the market for fresh consumption, a period in which they are subject to both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. fungi, which are particularly adapted to a saprophytic lifestyle, are among the main biological agents causing crop deterioration during transport and storage. in citrus, a common postharvest disease known as green mold and caused by penicillium digitatum can account for up to 90% of the total losses, especially in arid and sub-tropical climates  <cit> . nowadays, the control of post-harvest decay is achieved by the massive application of fungicides to marketed fruits. this however, has serious implications regarding toxicity, consumer acceptance and environmental risk. in this sense, reports of selection for fungicide resistant strains are increasing and represent a significant obstacle to postharvest conservation and commerce  <cit> . p. digitatum is a necrotrophic wound pathogen that requires pre-existing injured fruit peel to penetrate the plant tissue, and it colonizes mostly through the deployment of maceration enzymes. remarkably, and despite this rather unspecific infection mechanism, p. digitatum exhibits a high degree of host specificity and has not been described as ‘naturally-occurring’ in other pathosystems outside citrus fruits  <cit> . despite its considerable economic interest, the molecular bases of p. digitatum infection and host specificity remain largely unknown. we have previously analyzed the fruit’s transcriptomic response to p. digitatum infection and also to elicitors that trigger induced resistance  <cit> . here, we report the complete genome sequence of two p. digitatum strains that differ in their resistance to common fungicides and a comprehensive comparison across  <dig> other sequenced pezizomycotina. this resource will enable progress to be made towards understanding the physiology and virulence mechanisms of this economically important phytopathogen.

RESULTS
genome sequence
two previously described p. digitatum strains isolated from infected orange  and grapefruit  in valencia   <cit>  were selected for whole-genome sequencing. these strains differ in their antifungal resistance properties, pd <dig> being resistant to thiabendazole and imazalil, the two fungicides most commonly used in citrus postharvest. their genomes were sequenced with either roche  <dig> pyrosequencing  or illumina hiseq  <dig> , which also served to compare both sequencing strategies. final assemblies  resulted in similar genome size estimates of around  <dig> mb with an average gc content of  <dig> %. the 454-sequenced pd <dig> strain showed a smaller number of scaffolds and a larger n <dig> than the illumina-sequenced phi <dig> strain, but phi <dig> showed improved assembly parameters in terms of coverage, number of contigs and number of undetermined sites. since this latter property was found to significantly affect gene prediction quality , phi <dig> was used as the reference genome in further analyses. repeatmasker  <cit>  identified  <dig> % of the genome as being repetitive or corresponding to transposable elements . this value is similar to the  <dig> % found for p. chrysogenum, though there were differences in the distributions of the various types of elements. using a combined approach that included the use of rna-seq data, we predicted approximately  <dig>  protein-coding genes in each of the two strains. predicted genes include 100% of a set of  <dig> core genes found to be ubiquitous across all fungal clades  <cit> , attesting to the high coverage of our assembly and the reliability of the protein-coding gene prediction. protein-coding genes were functionally annotated using a combination of domain mapping and the transfer of functional annotations based on phylogenetic assignments of orthology relationships  <cit> . the complete sequences and predicted genes for these whole genome shotgun projects have been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession numbers akct <dig>  and akcu <dig> . the versions described in this paper are the first versions, akct <dig> and akcu <dig>  respectively, and provide a valuable tool for the discovery of genes important for p. digitatum physiology and pathogenicity. in the current study we explore the newly obtained genomes to gain insight into some of the main aspects of p. digitatum physiology.

sexual locus, nitrate utilization and iron uptake
as in many other ascomycetous fungi, no teleomorfic form or sexual reproduction cycle has been described for p. digitatum. we nevertheless found a conserved alpha-box mating-type protein  locus in both strains  in an area of conserved synteny with other penicillium and aspergillus species suggesting the possibility of sexual reproduction in these species. in addition, p. digitatum shows the organization typical of heterothallic pezizomycotina, with the presence of a single mat locus  <cit> .

p. digitatum is unique among penicillium species in its inability to use nitrate as sole nitrogen source  <cit> . this pathway is important for other filamentous fungi that use it to cope with situations in which the main sources of nitrogen such as ammonium, glutamate or glutamine are scarce. in the model fungus a. nidulans the nitrate assimilation pathway comprises three components: a nitrate-specific transporter , a nitrate reductase  and a nitrite reductase   <cit> , the encoding genes of which are clustered in the genome . in addition, in this species, nitrogen metabolism is controlled by both global  and pathway-specific  transcriptional regulators  <cit> . we searched the conceptual translation of the p. digitatum genome for the presence of homologs of the five above-mentioned a. nidulans proteins and found homologs to area, nira, niad and niia, the latter two being encoded by contiguous genes. however, p. digitatum lacks a homolog for the nitrate transporter crna . this is not only supported by the absence of this gene in both assembled p. digitatum genomes but also by the complete absence of p. digitatum reads  mapping to the p. chrysogenum crna locus at low stringency. the cluster formed by niad-niia-crna and the surrounding genes is highly conserved among aspergillus species. however, p. chrysogenum contains three putative open reading frames  between niia and crna. p. digitatum shares the same basic genome organization as p. chrysogenum with the exception that it lacks crna and the three orfs that interrupt the nitrate assimilation cluster. this indicates that this region has suffered important re-arrangements in the penicillium lineage, including the loss of the nitrate transporter in p. digitatum, which would explain the inability of this species to use nitrate. a comparison of the rates of non-synonymous vs synonymous codon substitutions  between p. chrysogenum and p. digitatum in the nitrate gene cluster shows values compatible with purifying selection , and similar to the average value for orthologous genes in these two species . this finding suggests the recent loss of crna or, alternatively, that niia and niad may still be functional in the absence of crna.

iron uptake is another important aspect of the biology of this species. like other filamentous fungi, p. digitatum is able to synthesize siderophores. similar to other aspergillus and penicillium species it contains the genes necessary to synthesize the extracellular siderophore fusarinine c, namely the homologs to sida, sidf and sidd , though it lacks sidg which in aspergillus fumigatus encodes a protein that catalizes the conversion of fusarinine c to the related siderophore triacetylfusarinine c. like p. chrysogenum, p. digitatum is able to synthesize ferrichrome instead of ferricrocin as described in other aspergillus species  <cit> . additionally, p. digitatum’s genome encodes six putative siderophore transporters, two of which are surprisingly absent from closely related species such as p. chrysogenum . one of these missing genes is mira, which in a. nidulans is involved in the transport of the bacterial siderophore enterobactin  <cit> . in p. digitatum mira is contiguous with esta, which in a. nidulans is thought to be involved in the hydrolysis of enterobactin  <cit> . the proximity of the two genes in p. digitatum supports the existence of a functional link between the proteins they encode. conversely, four of the putative siderophore transporters that are found in p. chrysogenum lack homologs in p. digitatum. other genomic and physiological features of p. digitatum, as well as their comparison with other sequenced pezizomycotina are discussed below.

comparison of the two sequenced strains
the two sequenced strains are highly similar with pairs of orthologs sharing on average  <dig> % identity at the protein level . this similarity extends to the chromosomal organization between the two strains, with  <dig> % of neighboring gene pairs being conserved. we could only detect two putative chromosomal re-arrangements . when aligning the reads of one strain to the other strain several coding regions remained unmapped suggesting that they could have been either lost or gained specifically in only one of the strains. more specifically, two genes were unique for strain pd <dig> and eight for phi <dig> , the two unique sequences in the resistant strain being contiguous in the assembly. the differences in the number of predicted genes for the two strains  are actually larger than those shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this is mostly due to genes not predicted in pd <dig> as a consequence of assembly gaps, since 52% of the phi26-unique genes mapped to regions containing ns and 48% appeared truncated in the pd <dig> assembly. the prediction of unique genes based on the mapping of reads from the other strain  is independent of differences in the assembly or gene prediction quality and thus should be considered to be more accurate.

few single nucleotide polymorphisms  were noted between the two strains. in total  <dig>  high confidence snps were found, of which  <dig> affected coding sequences. remarkably, there is an excess of non-synonymous  vs synonymous  snps, suggesting the possibility that part of the differences are the result of positive selection. among the  <dig> genes with more than one non-synonymous snps  we found one possibly having a regulatory function  and two putative membrane transporters  that could be involved in the extrusion of toxic compounds. in this regard it is interesting to note that p. digitatum pd <dig> is significantly more resistant than phi <dig> to several additional fungicides imazalil and thiabendazole .

among the detected snps we confirmed the presence of the phe-to-tyr mutation at codon  <dig> in the β-tubulin gene which has been associated with thiabendazole resistance in p. digitatum  <cit> . however, a second mutation affecting this gene, and related to benomyl resistance, was not found in either strain  <cit> . of particular note, we found two novel mutations in pd <dig> both of which cause coding sequence truncations, one in a gene  encoding a putative member of a phosphotransferase family  implicated in antibiotic resistance in bacteria  <cit> , and another in a gene  predicted to encode a putative hydrolase. the possible involvement in fungicide resistance of these mutations and some of the remaining differences between the two strains will require experimental validation. going one step in this direction, we specifically tested for this in the two abovementioned pd1-specific genes by constructing the corresponding knock-out strains and exposing them to a battery of six widely-used fungicides . neither of the two deleted strains showed significant differences in either fungicide resistance or their pathogenicity towards citrus fruits with respect to the wild-type pd <dig> control or an ectopic  transformant . we thus discount a direct involvement of these two genes in resistance to the six fungicides tested.

in addition to the differences already commented, our analyses also confirm the presence of a  <dig> bp insertion in the promoter of the cyp51b gene in pd <dig> that has been shown to confer resistance to imazalil by increasing gene expression  <cit> . no other variations were found in any of the three cyp <dig> genes described that could account for the differential susceptibility to imazalil observed between isolates pd <dig> and phi <dig>  notably, this  <dig> bp motif is represented  <dig> times in the pd <dig> genome and  <dig> times in phi <dig>  the locations of eight of these motifs are common between the strains but all except the resistance-associated insertion fall distant from protein-coding genes. comparison between the two strains revealed that the motifs absent in pd <dig> correspond to genomic regions that are either unassembled or unresolved for this strain. remarkably, the insertion site of the  <dig> bp motif in the cyp51b promoter is identical to that found in two other imazalil-resistant isolates from china  <cit> . given the few differences found between the two sequenced spanish strains and the observation that only a fraction of them are directly related to the resistance phenotype indicates that the appearance of fungicide resistance in p. digitatum is likely to involve few genomic mutations.

the high degree of genomic conservation also extends to the mitochondrial genomes of pd <dig> and phi <dig>  they exhibit very few differences and all involve small variations in the lengths of polynucleotide tracks, a phenomenon attributable to known sequencing error biases in the  <dig> technology  <cit> . it is thus highly likely that pd <dig> and phi <dig> have identical mitochondrial dna sequences. we next compared this sequence to the recently reported mitochondrial sequence from the chinese isolate pd <dig>  <cit> , and this also turned out to be identical. this indicates a remarkable conservation of mitochondrial dna sequences in distant isolates, and is suggestive of a recent expansion of p. digitatum around the globe. the cultivation of citrus has its origin in southeast asia, and, while its presence in southern europe can be dated back to the times of the roman empire, intensive production and massive worldwide trade only developed as recently as the 1940s  <cit> . our results indicate that the p. digitatum strains isolated in spain diverged from the chinese strain very recently and argue in favor of a recent expansion of this pathogenic species, probably coinciding with the initiation of intensive agricultural practices and worldwide trade.

comparison across species
we next compared the p. digitatum genome to those of  <dig> other sequenced pezizomycotina genomes including  <dig> other eurotiomycetes,  <dig> sordariomycetes,  <dig> dothideomycetes, and  <dig> leotiomycetes . we did so by sequence comparisons and by reconstructing the complete collection of phylogenetic trees of each p. digitatum protein and their homologs in other species . this enabled us to derive a complete catalogue of orthology and paralogy relationships among the species considered based on phylogenetic evidence  <cit> . all the alignments and gene trees are publicly available in phylomedb . in addition we reconstructed a species phylogeny based on the concatenation of  <dig> conserved orthologs . this phylogeny is highly supported and generally congruent, for the shared leaves, with previously published phylogenies of pezizomycotina  <cit> . in addition, this topology is the most parsimonious in terms of inferred duplications in the  <dig>  gene trees present in the p. digitatum phylome. the closest species related to p. digitatum with a completely sequenced genome is p. chrysogenum  <cit> . differences in gene content are noticeable, with the latter genome containing over  <dig>  genes more . orthology predictions revealed that only  <dig>   genes in p. chrysogenum had an ortholog in p. digitatum. conversely,  <dig>   p. digitatum genes have an ortholog in p. chrysogenum. interestingly, and despite the large differences in the total number of genes between p. digitatum and p. chrysogenum, both genomes have similar representations of the different functional classes. indeed, only small differences in the representation of cog functional categories were found . a comparison of gene ontology  terms  <cit>  however, showed two biological processes to be enriched among those genes present in p. chrysogenum but absent from p. digitatum: “transmembrane transport”, and “dna-dependent regulation of transcription”. this indicates that the streamlining of the p. digitatum genome has similarly affected all functional classes except two, which are likely related to the broader niche distribution and physiological flexibility of p. chrysogenum. genes lacking orthologs in p. digitatum are not distributed uniformly across the p. chrysogenum assembly , and are confined to supercontigs pc <dig>  pc <dig>  pc <dig> or pc <dig>  remarkably our data also show that the  <dig> genes in these supercontigs do not seem to have homologs in aspergillus species either, suggesting that they were gained specifically in p. chrysogenum. exploration of the chromosomal locations of blast hits and phylogenetic trees for the genes in these supercontigs reveals that a large percentage  of the protein-coding genes of the latter seem to have emerged from expansions of gene families that are present in other chromosomes . thus, recruitment from larger chromosomes and gene expansion, rather than direct acquisition through horizontal gene transfer seems to be the mechanism behind the origin of these chromosomal regions in p. chrysogenum. notably, we found that 50–60% of the proteins in p. chrysogenum annotated as having an “integrase core” or “reverse transcriptase” domains  were present in these unique contigs pointing to a possible retrotransposon-mediated mechanism of gene expansion. other domains specifically enriched in these contigs include the hat dimerization domain , bed zink fingers  and the cp <dig> transcription factor .

based on the phylome analysis we found that  <dig> p. digitatum proteins lack homologs in the closely-related but non-pathogenic species p. chrysogenum. of these,  <dig> have homologs exclusively in other plant pathogenic species thus highlighting them as good candidates for possible roles in virulence . other genes in p. digitatum have homologs in a limited number of fungal species while having widespread bacterial homologs, a pattern that could be indicative of horizontal gene transfer . previous analyses  <cit>  have found that genomes from pezizomycotina species are particularly enriched for genes acquired from prokaryotes. we have applied the same strategy to find genes of putatively prokaryotic origin in p. digitatum. four genes fulfilled our criteria . notably, one of these  was identified as having homologs in plant pathogenic fungi but not in the non-pathogenic penicillium, and also a homolog in a bacterial family  that has been associated with virulence in maize infections and the synthesis of t-toxin in cochliobolus heterostrophus  <cit> . none of the putatively transferred genes identified here in p. digitatum correspond to genes that have been described as hgt in p. chrysogenum, among which the penicillin gene cluster is included . another relevant hgt described in some fungi  <cit> , but absent in p. digitatum, is arsenate reductase  which in p. chrysogenum  <cit>  forms part of an arsenate resistance cluster. remarkably, we also identified the absence of homologs to the alternative arsenate reductases present in saccharomyces cerevisiae  or in other distantly-related fungi  <cit> . this would suggest that p. digitatum may be vulnerable to arsenic, or alternatively, that this species may be using another detoxification system not previously described in fungi. we next focused on five particular aspects of p. digitatum genomic content that are likely to provide hints for understanding this organism’s pathogenic lifestyle and constitute interesting targets for future research: namely i) secondary metabolism gene clusters, ii) the prediction of putative small cysteine-rich peptides , iii) homologs of known effector proteins iv) carbohydrate active enzymes , and finally iv) the repertoire of secreted proteins among which we expect to find those that potentially interact with the host and are involved in invasive growth of the fungus.

secondary metabolism
many important characteristics of fungi are the result of secondary metabolic activities, the genes of which tend to be organized in clusters. the discovery of these genes and the study of their evolution is a topic of increasing interest  <cit> . several penicillium species are sources of compounds or enzymatic activities that have important clinical or biotechnological applications  <cit> . these include the well-known antibiotic penicillin produced by p. chrysogenum and the antifungal and potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent griseofulvin produced by p. griseofulvum, as well as the capacity shown by diverse penicillium species for the degradation of several xenobiotics  <cit> . we detected  <dig> clusters in p. digitatum phi <dig> containing, among others,  <dig> backbone genes, of which  <dig> were nonribosomal peptide synthases ,  <dig> polyketide synthases , one prenyltransferase  and three nrps/pks hybrids . while fewer secondary metabolic clusters were found compared to p. chrysogenum , the difference is less when the relative sizes of the two genomes are taken into consideration . notably, the penicillin biosynthetic cluster is absent in p. digitatum, indicating the inability of this species to produce this potent antibiotic and suggesting that it may possess the ability to synthesize alternative antibiotics. similarly, while other penicillium species are able to synthesize cyclopiazonic acid  <cit> , p. digitatum is apparently unable to do so. indeed, a search of the p. digitatum genome failed to identify a cyclopiazonic acid gene cluster  or the presence of genes encoding additional enzymes such as moxa or ord <dig> required for the production of this metabolite. we were also unable to detect the presence of a putative cluster for the biosynthesis of patulin  which is known to be a potent mycotoxin in penicillium expansum <cit> , another postharvest pathogen closely related to p. digitatum. orthologs were nevertheless identified for seven of the fifteen patulin cluster members , six of which are clustered . interestingly, a putative truncated homolog of pati appears in the intergenic region between patj and patl. two additional genes  are located in a different scaffold separated by three genes. the presence of a truncated pati pseudogene, the loss of the other components and the absence of backbone genes around the cluster, suggest that these genes do not function in the patulin biosynthetic pathway. consistent with this interpretation, we found ratios of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions  close to  <dig> in most of the genes in the cluster, which is consistent with relaxation of the selective pressure . other clusters present in other fungal species but apparently absent in p. digitatum include, but are not limited to, griseofulvin, viridicatumtoxin, fumonisin, clavines, aflatoxins, sterigmatocystin, citrinin, ergot alkaloid, lovastatin and paxilline. we have however identified the melanine and the tryptoquialanine synthesis clusters, the latter previously described in penicillium aethiopicum  <cit>  and absent in p. chrysogenum.

small, cysteine-rich peptides and effector proteins
several fungi are known to secrete small cysteine-rich proteins  that exhibit diverse biological functions including adherence  <cit> , virulence  <cit>  or antimicrobiosis  <cit> . some crps are virulence effectors that show carbohydrate binding activity that interferes with host recognition of the pathogen  <cit> . it has been suggested that antimicrobial proteins could become extremely useful in medicine and agriculture to treat pathogenic infections in the near future  <cit> . several antifungal crps exhibiting antimicrobial activity have been characterized from ascomycetous fungal species from the genera aspergillus and penicillium <cit> . these cationic proteins share the previously described γ-motif common to small antimicrobial proteins and peptides  <cit> . two distinct antifungal crps have been isolated and characterized from cultures of p. chrysogenum  <cit> . among the predicted proteins in p. digitatum we found a crp  showing 91% amino acid identity with the pc12g <dig> gene from p. chrysogenum which corresponds to one of the previously reported proteins  <cit> . remarkably, the ortholog to pc24g <dig>  is absent in p. digitatum as it is located in the pc <dig> supercontig which is virtually devoid of p. digitatum orthologs. we identified two additional putative crps in p. digitatum  by performing profile-searches with crp motifs identified in plants  <cit> . due to their short length, crps are likely to be under-predicted in the annotation of sequenced genomes. this prompted us to extend the genome annotation with a specific search  for additional small crps that contain at least four cysteine residues, display similarities to known crps, harbor the γ-motif and/or have a high content of cationic residues typical of antimicrobial proteins, under the assumption that these might have been under-predicted in the initial annotation . we found  <dig> additional orfs that potentially would code for crps, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> residues . two of these putative crps  share the γ-motif, making them good candidates for having antifungal activity.

we next searched the pathogen-host interaction database  <cit>  for p. digitatum proteins homologous to effector proteins from other pathogenic fungi  <cit> . these include not only crps but also other types of proteins that can modulate host physiology. again, p. digitatum encodes a smaller number of homologs of known effector proteins compared to p. chrysogenum, but abundances relative to the total proteome are comparable . we found eight p. digitatum homologs to ace <dig> of magnaporte grisea, six to hopi <dig> , and single homologs to npp <dig> , gip <dig> and gip <dig> . additionally, five proteins in p. digitatum contain the lysm domain  of which two have no orthologs in p. chrysogenum and are closely related to a. nidulans and aspergillus carbonarius instead. of note, the fraction of proteins with homologs in the known effector proteins dataset is roughly similar  across all the pezyzomycotina genomes analyzed regardless of their phytopathogenicity. this result illustrates the limitations of using mere homology to predict the functional roles of proteins.

carbohydrate active enzymes 
plant cell wall carbohydrate components form a complex network of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. these polysaccharides, together with others not derived from plants, are targets of the carbohydrate-active enzymes  that degrade them into simple monomers that can be used as nutrients  <cit> . a search for interpro signatures present in cazyme families identified  <dig> putative cazyme genes . this number is one of the smallest reported for ascomycetes  <cit> . however, in terms of relative abundance this number is comparable to the  <dig> cazymes present in p. chrysogenum. among p. digitatum cazymes,  <dig> have clear assignments to either glycoside hydrolases , carbohydrate esterases  or polysaccharide lyases  involved in fungal cell wall degradation, a number close to the  <dig> found in p. chrysogenum. in contrast, a larger difference was observed in the number of enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation:  <dig> in p. digitatum as compared to  <dig> in p. chrysogenum. most of this difference can be attributed to gh families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which account for  <dig> enzymes in p. chrysogenum and only  <dig> in p. digitatum. enzymes in these families are mostly related to the degradation of celullose  and hemicellulose . interestingly, two cazy families involved in pectin degradation are enriched in p. digitatum compared to p. chrysogenum. p. digitatum contains eight polygalacturonases belonging to familiy gh <dig>  and three pectinesterases included in family ce <dig>  whereas p. chrysogenum has five and two proteins in these two families, respectively. given that p. digitatum is a phytopathogen, whereas p. chrysogenum is not, these differences could provide hints to help identify the cazymes relevant for citrus fruit infection in p. digitatum.

secretome
fungi use secreted enzymes to break-down biopolymers the resulting products of which are then transported inside cells for further metabolic processing, and in phytopathogenic fungi secreted proteins constitute the first line of interaction with the host and play important roles in virulence  <cit> . since secreted fungal enzymes have found a wide range of applications in the food, feed, pulp and paper, bioethanol and textile industries there is a growing interest in deciphering the complement of secreted proteins in sequenced genomes . using an in silico pipeline  we predicted  <dig> secreted proteins, of which  <dig>  code for various hydrolases such as proteases, lipases or nucleases  among the pezizomycotina species considered, p. digitatum has the second smallest predicted proteome after uncinocarpus reesii . similarly, p. digitatum also has one of the smallest secretomes comprising  <dig> proteins , which in relative terms is somewhat smaller than the secretome of p. chrysogenum  and the average 8% found in aspergillus species, and much lower than the 14% of secreted proteins found in the magnaporthe species . that p. digitatum is a necrotroph and contains one of the smallest secretomes among analyzed fungi suggests that the absolute number of secreted proteins has no direct relationship with the lifestyle of a pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
previous analyses comparing the genomic features of necrotrophic fungal pathogens  <cit>  lacked the inclusion of a necrotrophic eurotiomycete. our comparison of two p. digitatum genomes from strains that differ in their fungicide resistance traits with those of other sequenced pezizomycotina thus constitutes the first comprehensive genomic analysis of a necrotrophic organism within this important fungal clade that includes other plant pathogens such as those in the aspergillus genus. our data suggest a recent global expansion of p. digitatum, consistent with the relatively modern origin of intensive cultivation and worldwide commercialization of citrus. in addition, our comparative analysis suggests the action of positive selection and that important differences in fungicide resistance seem to have been achieved through a small number of genomic changes. our analyses also uncovered other strain-specific differences, the functional roles of which will be worth exploring. we show a striking reduction in gene content in p. digitatum compared to the close relative p. chrysogenum. large regions in the p. chrysogenum genome, including entire supercontigs, are completely absent from p. digitatum and originated via large gene family expansions rather than through horizontal gene transfer. although we could only detect enrichment of two functional classes among the genes lost in the p. digitatum lineage, detailed analysis revealed important physiological implications such as the loss of the ability to use nitrate as a nitrogen source. other differences extend to secreted proteins and cazyme-encoding genes, and may serve as a basis to understand the host-specificity of p. digitatum. with respect to pathogenicity determinants, and consistent with analysis of other phytopathogenic genomes  <cit> , there seem to be no global differences that distinguish these pathogens from other pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi. these findings reinforce the view that necrotrophic pathogenicity is a very complex trait that involves many genes that may vary in different lineages. our data pave the way for a more systematic functional and experimental analysis of candidate genes that will eventually reveal the details of the complex interaction between p. digitatum and its host.
