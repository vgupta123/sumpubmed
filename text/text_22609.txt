BACKGROUND
detection of copy number aberrations  using single nucleotide polymorphism  array data or array comparative genomic hybridization  data is becoming important in disease pathogenesis analysis  <cit> . for example, cna may result in suppression of anti-oncogenes and activation of oncogenes, which would cause certain types of cancers  <cit> . disease related cnas not only indicate the molecular-level pathogenesis, but also can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis. for example, myelodysplastic syndromes  are a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders, which are considered as clonal stem cell diseases characterized by peripheral cytopenias  with normocellular or hypercellular marrow and bilineage or trilineage dysplasia  <cit> . early diagnosis with appropriate treatment may lead to improved prognosis, however, there is no accurate diagnosic method at the early stage of mdss because the morphological appearances are highly variable and not specific to the mdss  <cit> . using the high density snp arrays, the molecular-level biomarkers of mdss may be detected, and are helpful for the mds early diagnosis and treatment.

to detect the cna regions using high density snp arryas, automated snp array analysis method is needed. however, it is nontrivial to detect the cna automatically because the signals obtained from high density snp arrays often have low snr values, which may be caused by whole genome amplification, mixture of normal and tumor cells, experimental noise and other technical limitations. with the reduction in snr, many false cna regions are often detected and true cna regions are missed. thus, more sophisticated statistical models are needed urgently to make the cnas detection robust and reliable using the signals with low snr, although a number of software packages have been developed for the snp array analysis. for affymetrix snp array, the widely used software packages are genotyping console  <cit> , gemca  <cit> , cnag  <cit>  and dchip  <cit>  and birdsuite  <cit> . for illumina snp array, penncnv  <cit> , quantisnp  <cit> , genocn  <cit> , somatics  <cit>  and overunder  <cit>  have been developed. for array-cgh data, acgh   <cit> , clac   <cit> , cbs   <cit>  and glad   <cit> , and many other cna detection algorithms have been developed  <cit> . usually there are two types of copy number analysis: one is the cna, the other is copy number variation  analysis. the cnvs naturally happens in normal tissue and are inheritable, while the cna are acquired somatic alterations and often observed in disease tissues, which also tend to be longer and more densely occur in the genome  <cit> . most of the abovementioned software packages could detect both cnvs and cnas, whereas some of them may incorporate more information to improve their performance specifically for cnv or cna detection. for example, the somatics and genocna incorporate the normal tissue contamination information for better cnas detection.

gemca is a good software package for copy number variants detection in hapmap data, which can combine both nsp and sty arrays to detect small copy number variant regions. it is stated in the website of this software that it is not suitable for cancer analysis that has much larger copy number changes, and the new software programs are being developed for cancer copy number analysis  <cit> . for genotyping console, cnag  <cit>  and dchip  <cit> , although different pre-processing techniques  are used, they all use hmm framework  <cit>  in the second tier to infer the copy number. however, the major limitation of the hmm framework lies in the simple assumption that the current state is only determined by the immediate previous state and the current observation  <cit> . due to this assumption, the noisy snp array data often results in inaccurate copy number inference. in birdsuite software package, the birdseye method, which is a hmm, is implemented to find cnv regions  <cit> . the quantisnp, penncnv and genocn all make use of the hmms on the two dimensional data: log r ratio  and b allele frequency   <cit> . compared to quantisnp, penncnv improved the transition probabilities in hmm, baf distribution, accuracy of likelihood of copy number genotype modelling, and added the family-based analysis  <cit> . in the genocn software, the cnv and cna detections are processed by two different modules: genocnv and genocna  <cit> . the genocna incorporates the normal tissue contamination and genotype data from normal tissue to improve the cna detection accuracy  <cit> . somatics uses the two-band pattern of baf to detect the cnas of samples that mix the normal and tumor cells  <cit> . overunder detects the cna by dividing the 2d square of the b allele frequency  and the log r ratio  into different regions that correspond to the loss, gain, amplification  <cit> . acgh uses the unsupervised hmm. cbs  makes use of the maximum of a likelihood ratio statistic recursively to separate snp sequence into small segments. in glad method, an adaptive weights smoothing procedure is used to estimate the means of sequence segments. in clac the hierarchical clustering method is used to detect the cna regions. cbs, glad and clac only estimate the means of sequence segments, rather than give the exact copy number of each segment.

in this study, we present a novel conditional random pattern  model for cna detection, in which more contextual information of neighboring snp loci is considered, compared to hmm, to suppress the noise and improve the accuracy of cna detection. specifically, in the crp model, the copy number of a snp locus is not only determined by the copy numbers of its two immediate neighboring snp loci, but also by a continuous segment of observations , thus allows us to employ more contextual cues. the rest of this paper is organized as follows. the details of the crp model are described in section  <dig>  section  <dig> provides the experimental validations, and the discussion and conclusions are presented in section  <dig> 

RESULTS
to validate the proposed crp model, we compared the proposed crp model with dchip, cnag and penncnv-affy, and four widely used copy number inference software packages: acgh, cbs, clac, and glad, using both simulated data and real data.

validation data
to validate the proposed crp model, three real data sets were employed. the first one is from the mdss samples in our laboratory.  <dig> cryopreserved bone marrow samples from mds patients were analyzed. please see the detailed samples' information in the additional file  <dig>  the second one is the array-cgh data used in lai's  <dig> paper  <cit> . we also downloaded the hapmap samples'  <dig> k snp array data from the affymetrix website http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/500k_hapmap_genotype_data.affx. two hapmap samples, na <dig>  and na <dig>  were used to test the crp model, in which some cna regions were validated by quantitative pcr in  <cit> .

since there is no ground truth of the cna regions in these data, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the performance of different software packages. therefore, two more simulated data sets were created. we simulated affymetrix genechip human mapping  <dig> k array data in the affymetrix's cel file format, which is based on the real  <dig> k snp arrays of hapmap samples from the affymetrix website, therefore both dchip and cnag  can process them. the simulation process of these data is as follows. first, we randomly selected three arrays as the normal reference samples: "na10851_finnsp_vr1_579813_a1_1_sc2", "na12812_finnsp_vr1_579813_b2_1_sc6" and "na18605_finnsp_vr1_579548_d5_1_sc3". secondly, we randomly set one cna region in each chromosome, and a total of  <dig> cna regions were obtained . the length of these cna regions varies from  <dig> to  <dig> snps uniformly. thirdly, for each reference sample and certain noise level, two simulated arrays are generated, one for copy number deletion , and the other for copy amplification . the mismatch probes are used as the background to estimate the simulated intensities of the corresponding perfect match probes in these cna regions. the intensity of probes outside the cna regions remains unchanged. then the gaussian noises are generated and added to all probes, which follow a gaussian distribution, n, where the standard deviation of noise σ is proportional to the probe intensity y. the signal to noise ratio  snr = y/σ varied from  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> , to simulate different noise levels. a total of  <dig> samples were simulated based on the three selected hapmap samples .

we also simulated log2-ratio sequences. for each noise level, we simulated  <dig> log2-ratio sequences, and each sequence contains  <dig> log2-ratio data points. four cna regions with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> length were created. in the cna regions, the mean was set as  <dig> , and outside the cna regions the mean was zero. then the gaussian noise n was added. three noise levels were considered, and the snr  varied from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> 

validation metrics
to measure the performance of copy number inference software packages, seven metrics were used: snp-precision , snp-recall , region-precision , region-recall , hybrid-precision , hybrid-recall , and f-score . given a contingency table, as seen in table  <dig>  the seven metrics are defined as follows.

 and .

the snp-precision and snp-recall measure the accuracy in the single snp level, which indicate how many snps in all the cna regions are detected or missed. the cna region based metrics indicate how many single cna regions are detected  or missed  without considering the length of the cna regions. the hybrid metrics combine the single snp and cna region based metrics together to generate the f-score to examine the overall performance of a software package.

comparison with dchip, cnag and penncnv-affy
to evaluate the performance of the crp model, we compared it with a number of widely used software packages: dchip, cnag and penncnv-affy. in august  <dig>  penncnv provided the penncnv-affy protocol to calculate the lrr and baf signals from affymetrix snp arrays, and then make the cna detection.

results on simulated  <dig> k snp array data set
the proper comparisons between different algorithms are not trivial because of different possible parameter settings in each algorithm. in cnag, users can manually set the means of the hmm for each copy number status. to make the comparison fair, we tried to find the best performance of the cnag by testing a few different parameter settings. then we compared the crp model with the best performance of cnag. since we simulated the three-copy amplifications and one-copy deletions in the simulated  <dig> k snp array data, we only need to set the means of three-copy, mcn <dig> =  <dig> , and one-copy, mcn <dig>  in cnag. we tested following five different parameter settings of hmm in cnag: 1) 'automatic' - the parameters are set by the cnag automatically. 2) 'ideal' - . we estimated the means in the 'ideal' by calculating the means of the three-copy amplifications and one-copy deletions in the simulated data respectively. 3) 'random_1' - . 4) 'random_2' - . 5) 'random_3' - . figure  <dig> shows the performances of cnag on the simulated  <dig> k snp arrays with the five different parameter settings. as we can see, the cnag generated 'best' results in the 'random_2' settings. then we compared the crp performance with the 'best' results of the cnag. the detailed cna detection results of the crp model and that of the cnag, with the 'random_2' parameter setting, are provided in table  <dig> and table  <dig> respectively. figure  <dig> provides the performance comparison between the crp model and cnag with optimal parameter setting. obviously, the crp model outperforms the cnag in all three snr levels and all  <dig> simulated  <dig> k snp samples significantly.

since the parameters of hmm in dchip are determined automatically and are not user accessible  <cit> , we evaluated the dchip using its default parameter setting. for penncnv, we followed the user guide to evaluate its performance  <cit> . the comparison results with dchip and penncnv-affy are provided in figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. from the high 'recall' and low 'precision' rates of dchip results, we concluded that dchip detected many false cnas, as seen in figure  <dig>  the penncnv-affy works well on samples with high snr value, while its accuracy decreases dramatically with the reduction in snr, as seen in figure  <dig>  the low 'recall' and the high 'precision' rates indicate that the penncnv-affy is not sensitive to small cnas. through the comparisons, we conclude that the crp model is more robust to noise and improves the accuracy of cna detection significantly compared with the hmms implemented in cnag, dchip and penncnv-affy.

results on the real mds data sets
we applied the dchip, cnag, penncnv-affy and crp model to the mdss affymetrix  <dig> k snp arrays. for both dchip and penncnv, the default settings were used. for cnag, we tested a few different parameter settings, and the one with best performance on the pre-known monosomy and trisomy regions is selected. twenty snp arrays of normal tissue dna samples from the buccal and lymphoid tissues of ten mds patients were used as the reference set. figures  <dig> provide the cna detection results of these four software packages on two mds samples. the top, second, third and last lanes in figure  <dig> present the results of dchip, cnag, penncnv and crp model respectively. in sample  <dig>  the chromosome- <dig> has only single copy, and in sample  <dig>  the chromosome- <dig> has three copies as determined by conventional cytogenetic study. obviously, dchip detects many false positive cnas in both samples, and infers most of snps wrongly as four copies. both dchip and penncnv-affy miss many deletion regions in chromosome  <dig> of sample  <dig>  and penncnv-affy works well on the chromosome- <dig> of sample  <dig>  however, it looks not sensitive to the small cna regions . after parameter adjusting manually, cnag works well on the monosomy and trisomy chromosomes. however, cnag detects very few copy number deletions and some cna regions with only one snp. low snr of log2-ratio signals is one reason of these errors. compared with dchip, cnag and penncnv-affy, crp model makes use of more contextual cues, and generates more accurate results. we identified some mdss related regions, 7q <dig>  and 7p <dig>  , which were missed by dchip, cnag, penncnv-affy. additionally, a copy number deletion region carrying foxp <dig> gene located at 7q <dig>  was detected using crp model in another case, while it was also missed by dchip, cnag and penncnv-affy. this region was confirmed by quantitative pcr, as seen in the additional file  <dig> <cit> .

comparison with acgh, cbs, clac and glad
a number of cna detection algorithms have been developed for array cgh data  <cit> . to further evaluate the performance of the crp model, we compared the crp model with four widely used cna detection methods: acgh  <cit> , clac  <cit> , cbs  <cit>  and glad  <cit> .

results on simulated log2-ratio sequences
the average performances of the crp model, acgh, cbs, clac and glad software packages are provided in figure  <dig>  in terms of single-, region- and hybrid-precision, crp, cbs and clac have similar performance, in which fewer false cna regions were wrongly detected. however, they missed some small cna regions, as seen by the recall-metric results in figure  <dig>  the results of acgh were not good. acgh software package used the unsupervised hmm, in which all the parameters of the hmm will be estimated based on the observation data  <cit> . however, the parameter estimation method is sensitive to noise, and then often causes inaccurate cna detection results. in terms of single-, region- and hybrid-recall, crp model generates better results than the other software packages, which means more cna regions were missed by the other software packages, especially the small cna regions. in all the snr levels, crp model outperforms the others in term of f-score . when the snr level decreased , the overall performance  of the other software packages decreased more rapidly than crp, which indicates the crp model is more robust to noise.

results on lai's data
the array-cgh data of chromosome  <dig> in a glioblastoma multiforme sample  used in lai's bioinformatics paper  were also tested. figure  <dig> provides the cna region detection results of crp model and the four widely used software packages. we empirically set the means and standard deviations of crp as:  and . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  all the five methods detected the copy number loss region, whereas the acgh method wrongly segmented the normal region into the loss region. the clac method segmented some loss regions as normal regions. both cbs and glad segmented the whole region into two parts, suggesting that these two methods suppressed noise well and could detect the difference between two chromosomal regions. however, their strong ability to suppress the noise also results in the missing of small cna regions, as seen in the above results on the simulated data. additionally, these two software packages only can give the average values of regions rather than the exact the copy number. in contrast, the crp model generated the exact copy number and detected the major part of the loss region, although a few small loss regions were separated into normal regions.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a crp model for cna detection, which explores more contextual cues to generate more accurate results than existing methods. the experimental results using both simulated data and real mds snp array data show that the crp model is more robust and reliable compared to a number of widely used cna detection methods.

for different studies and different noise levels, different number of nodes in the crp model may be required. more nodes mean more contextual information to be considered, and can suppress higher noise levels, while it is prone to missing of small cna regions. fewer nodes will be more sensitive to small cna regions, and as such be more sensitive to noise. to make the model adjustment convenient, we implemented the algorithm with the number of nodes as a user-input parameter. thus, it could automatically generate a crp model with any user-specified number of nodes. the basic idea of generating the crp model is as follows. first, assume that the shortest cna region has m snp markers. then select m- <dig> nearby snp markers respectively from both the left and right of the current snp marker. as a result, totally 2m- <dig> +1) snp markers are selected. in these 2m-1snp markers, there are m possible cna regions with m consecutive snp markers, i.e. drawing m consecutive snp markers out of the total of  snp markers. the rest may be deduced by analogy. there are m- <dig> possible cna regions with m+ <dig> consecutive snp markers, and to the end, there is only one cna region with 2m- <dig> snp markers. therefore, there are totally  possible cnas patterns out of these 2m- <dig> snp markers. in this study, we assume that m =  <dig>  then there are  <dig> possible cna patterns. in a word, it is convenient for users to test the crp model with different parameters on their own data.

the parameters in the crp model were estimated based on some pre-known cna regions. the users can adjust these parameters according to their specific snp array data. also the crp model gives the probability of each snp locus staying in each copy number status. if too many cna regions are detected , the users can remove some cna regions with low probability. currently, the haldane's map function is employed as the transition potential in the crp model. for different diseases and different populations, some prior information of the copy number change can be included into the transition potential. for example, if certain regions of the genome are known to the 'recombination hotspots', then we can set the transition possibility from one copy number to the other higher. therefore, the future extension of crp model will consider the snp-specific copy number aberration rates, and automatically adjust the structure  of the crp model in running the program.
