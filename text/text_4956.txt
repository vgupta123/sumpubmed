BACKGROUND
mast cells  are derived from hematopoietic stem cells and play important roles in allergic responses, innate immunity and defense against parasite infection. unlike other blood cells, mcs migrate into peripheral tissues as immature progenitors and differentiate into mature mast cells. one of the unique features of mcs is that they show a variety of phenotypes depending on the different tissue microenvironment of their maturation  <cit> . in mcs, various mc-specific serine proteases are stored in the secretory granules, and their gene and protein expressions are dramatically altered when their cell environment is altered. for example, reynolds et al. have shown that at least six distinct members of mouse mc-specific serine proteases are expressed in different combinations in different mast cell populations  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have shown that mature mcs vary in terms of what surface receptors and lipid mediators they express  <cit> . because each mast cell population in vivo must play a specific role in the body, it is important to determine the character of each population of mcs.

comprehensive gene expression analysis is a powerful approach to understand the characterization of various mc subpopulations. to date, several studies on microarray analysis of mcs have been conducted  <cit> , but most of them dealt with mcs cultured in vitro. alternatively, gene expression profiles of mcs isolated from skin and lung have been analyzed  <cit> . however, the numbers of mcs analyzed as one sample were relatively high and they were exposed to physical forces, enzymes and the anti-kit antibody for purification, during which the original properties of the mcs may have been affected.

in the gastrointestinal tract, there are mcs that are mainly classified into two subclasses; mucosal mcs  and submucosal mcs  on the basis of their location, morphology  and granule contents  <cit> . mmcs are mainly found in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal system, having chondroitin sulfate-containing granules, which are stained with toluidine blue but not safranin, and their activation occurs during parasite infection  <cit> , while smcs are localized in the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and their granules are rich in heparin and stained with both toluidine blue and safranin  <cit> . however, the molecular basis determining the differences in biochemical properties of these two mc subclasses remains uncertain, partially due to the difficulty of their isolation.

to overcome these problems, here we established a method of rna amplification from intact mcs isolated from frozen tissue sections, which enables us to conveniently obtain the global gene expression pattern of mcs in various tissues. to validate this method, we first determined the minimum cell number required to achieve reproducible rna amplification. we then compared the gene expression profiles obtained from small numbers of mmcs and smcs in the mouse stomach, and found several key genes to be specifically expressed in one subclass of mcs, which may reflect some aspects of the distinct properties between the two mc subclasses in the gastrointestinal tract.

RESULTS
development of an rna amplification protocol to obtain gene expression profiles from a small amount of rna
to gain insight into the functional differences between the different subclasses of mcs, we employed three rounds of the t7-based rna amplification method. based on the preliminary experiments using peritoneal mcs and bone marrow-derived mcs , we estimated that a single mc yields  <dig> pg of rna. before we performed comparative analysis of mcs from different tissues, we first evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of three rounds of the t7-based rna amplification method, starting with the amount of rna that can be obtained from a single mc. to assess this, we first compared the microarray results obtained from  <dig> μg of bmmc rna prepared by the standard protocol with those obtained from the same rna diluted 105- or 106-fold  and subjected to three rounds of t7-based amplification . although three rounds of amplification yielded enough quantity of rna for microarray analysis  even in the case of  <dig> pg rna, scatter plot analysis revealed that the qualities of the obtained results were quite different between the samples from  <dig> μg and  <dig> pg rna. the genes judged as 'presence' in both  <dig> pg and  <dig> μg of rna were  <dig>  genes, which corresponded to 72% of genes judged as 'presence' in the  <dig> μg of rna , while only  <dig>  genes were judged as 'presence' in both  <dig> pg and  <dig> μg of rna, which corresponded to only 36% of genes judged as 'presence' in the  <dig> μg rna . the decrease in the number of genes judged as 'presence' in the diluted samples  may be due to the loss of low copy number rna species during amplification.

we next examined the reproducibility of the microarray results obtained from two sets of  <dig> pg bmmc rna samples  or two sets of  <dig> pg samples  . in the  <dig> pg rna samples,  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes were judged as 'presence'. however, only  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes were judged as 'presence' in each  <dig> pg rna sample, again suggesting the loss of low copy number rnas during amplification from a small amount of rna. as to the reproducibility, 86% of the 'presence' genes in the  <dig> pg- <dig> and 74% of 'presence' genes in the  <dig> pg- <dig> sample were judged as 'presence' in both  <dig> pg rna samples, while only 57% of 'presence' genes in the  <dig> pg- <dig> and 55% of 'presence' genes in the  <dig> pg- <dig> sample were judged as 'presence' in both  <dig> pg rna samples. these results suggested that the amplified products from the rna from a single mc  by the current method may include considerable amplification artifacts causing problems in accuracy and reproducibility. on the other hand, because of the higher reproducibility , we concluded that amplification from  <dig> pg rna collected from  <dig> mcs would be suitable for the practical analysis of tissue mcs. based on these results, we set our goal in this study to acquire gene expression profiles of mcs pooled from different regions. to minimize the influence of cell-to-cell variations within the same class and potential amplification artifacts, we prepared three sets of  <dig> mcs for each region and compared genes with significantly different expression between mcs from the different regions . we chose stomach as the source organ, since we can isolate two kinds of mcs from the mucosa  and the submucosa  regions of the same sections, and mmcs and smcs have been suspected to be different in several mc properties such as protease expression profile and sensitivity to safranin staining  <cit> .

gene expression profiles of submucosal and mucosal mcs from the stomach
to visualize two kinds of mcs in the stomach without causing rna degradation, the sections were fixed with carnoy's fixative and metachromatically stained with toluidine blue for a few seconds. smcs and mmcs were microdissected using a patch pipette . we prepared three sets of  <dig> mcs for each region, extracted their rna and individually amplified them . to improve the recovery of the extraction of as little as  <dig> pg of rna, we used 'poly g' as a carrier, which does not interfere with the following rna amplification or hybridization of the amplified product to the array . to examine the effects of nonspecifically amplified artifact products, we performed the rna extraction/amplification procedure without adding microdissected cells  as a negative control . the amplified rnas of smcs, mmcs and the "no cell" control were separately hybridized to a murine microarray. the signal values in the "no cell" sample were low in general and similar to the background levels . the scatter plots of the samples independently prepared within the same group  showed a similar expression pattern; the average correlation coefficient for all probe-sets was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in smcs and mmcs, respectively . in contrast, the average correlation coefficient between smcs and mmcs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which was much lower than those within the same group, suggesting that their gene expression patterns are different.

we further evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of our method by other comprehensive analyses  using all probe sets. microarray data obtained from smcs, mmcs, skin-derived mcs, peritoneal mcs, bmmcs and non-mcs  were applied to these analyses. we first checked whether the amplification process in our method affects the global expression profile due to non-linear amplification. the results from the bmmc samples using rna prepared by the standard protocol  or the amplification method  were subjected to these analyses. both hierarchical clustering analysis and pca revealed that microarray data from bmmc-std and bmmc-amp were clustered in the same group , suggesting that the global similarity in gene expression profiles is maintained during the amplification process. we next examined the similarity of expression patterns in three independent smc or mmc samples. upon clustering analysis and pca, smc1– <dig> and mmc1– <dig> were clustered in the same group, respectively. pca also showed that the expression profiles of smcs, mmcs and bmmcs are mutually different .

we then compared the stomach-derived mcs  with skin-derived mcs, peritoneal mcs, bmmcs and non-mcs  by clustering analysis. the tissue-derived mcs  were clustered separately from peritoneal mcs and bmmcs. these results may reflect different properties between tissue-derived mcs with firm adhesion to the neighboring cells and floating mcs without a tight contact. as to the similarity of mcs with fibroblasts and macrophages, it is reasonable that fibroblasts are most distant from mcs and macrophages are closer to mcs as a leukocyte family.

validation of microarray results by real time rt-pcr analysis
we next investigated whether the hybridization signals of known marker genes specific for smcs and mmcs showed the expected expression trends  <cit> . the mmc-specific genes, mast cell protease  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed higher values in mmcs, while the smc-specific marker genes, mast cell protease  <dig>  and chymase  <dig> , showed higher signal values in smcs   <cit> . on the other hand, mc-common markers such as kit oncogene  and fcε receptor  showed significant signal values with no bias between mmcs and smcs. to further evaluate the results, we measured the expression levels of these marker genes by real-time rt-pcr using rna from the independently isolated mcs . moreover, we randomly selected three genes showing 'mmc-biased' expression and another three genes showing 'smc-biased' expression; expression of these genes in mcs has not been reported previously . there were no significant differences in the expression levels of kit and fcer1a between mmcs and smcs. in contrast, the mmc-specific markers mcpt <dig> and mcpt <dig> and the 'mmc-biased' genes, anxa <dig>  ctse, and fos showed higher expression in mmcs, and the smc-specific markers mcpt <dig> and cma <dig> and the 'smc-biased' genes, cnn <dig>  ces <dig>  and cpe showed higher expression in smcs. these results indicate that the microarray results are reliable and reflect the gene expression profiles of intact smcs and mmcs in the stomach.

clustering analysis of the gene expression profiles and functional categorization between smcs and mmcs
of the ~ <dig>  genes represented on the oligonucleotide array, we selected  <dig>  genes whose expression levels between smc1– <dig> and mmc1– <dig> were significantly different . the expression level of each gene was normalized by its level in bmmcs, which are cultured mcs with so-called 'immature' properties, and the selected genes were classified into seven clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm . we also classified the genes into functional categories, and the representative genes are listed . among them,  <dig> genes  showed smc-biased expression ; in 78%  of smc-rich genes, the expression levels were relatively low in bmmcs and augmented in smc . for example, the expression level of mcpt <dig> was relatively low in bmmcs, and if the expression profile of bmmcs reflects the immature properties of mc progenitors, mcpt <dig> can be concluded to be induced during the final maturation into smcs. interestingly, the smc marker genes mcpt <dig> and mcpt <dig> were classified into cl2/ <dig>  suggesting that these genes were expressed to some extent in 'immature' bmmcs, but their expression was suppressed during maturation into mmcs. on the other hand,  <dig> genes  showed mmc-biased expression ; in 51%  of mmc-rich genes, their expression levels in bmmcs were low but were augmented in mmcs . for example, expression of mcpt <dig> was low in 'immature' bmmcs but was drastically induced during maturation into mmcs.

protein expression of notch <dig> in smcs and ptgr <dig> in mmcs in stomach tissue
among the genes showing differential expression , we further focused on the expression of notch <dig> in smcs and ptgr <dig> in mmcs, both of which have never been previously characterized in mcs. the notch <dig> gene product is a member of the notch family, consisting of transmembrane receptors which are activated by cell surface ligands on adjacent cells. recent studies have suggested that notch signaling is involved in lymphocyte and mast cell differentiation  <cit> . we first confirmed that notch <dig> expression is significantly higher in the separately pooled smcs than mmcs by real-time rt-pcr . we next investigated whether the notch <dig> protein is exclusively present in smcs by immunostaining of stomach tissue . notch <dig> signals were detected in the nucleus-like structures of smcs but not in those of mmcs. furthermore, notch <dig> signals were also found in the skin mcs, which were adjacently clustered with smcs . these results show that notch <dig> is present in smcs but not in mmcs, and suggest that notch <dig> participates in smc-specific transcription of notch-target genes, which may be required for some smc functions. in hematopoietic cells, it has been reported that constitutively active notch <dig> promotes the expansion of progenitor cells and inhibits myeloid differentiation  <cit> . since notch ligands have been shown to exist in connective tissues such as skin dermis  <cit> , it will be interesting to explore whether notch <dig> plays a role in the differentiation of smcs and the maintenance of smc functions.

the ptgr <dig> product, 15-oxo-prostaglandin 13-reductase/leukotriene  b <dig> 12-hydroxydehydrogenase is an essential enzyme for inactivation of eicosanoids such as prostaglandin e <dig>  and ltb <dig>  <cit> . although it has been reported that the pathways of eicosanoid synthesis differ among the different mc subclasses  <cit> , our results suggest that the inactivation system of eicosanoids also varies among the mc subclasses. ptgr <dig> expression was found to be significantly higher in the separately pooled mmcs by real-time rt-pcr . we also examined ptgr <dig> expression in stomach sections by immunostaining. signals for the ptgr <dig> protein were found in granule-like structures of mmcs in the stomach mucosa but not in smcs , suggesting that the ptgr <dig> enzyme may be released from mmcs upon degranulation. since pge <dig> plays critical roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis through mucosal protection and inhibition of acid secretion, it is possible that when activated, mmcs negatively regulate the cytoprotective actions of pge <dig> through rapid inactivation by ptgr <dig> 

gene expression pattern of extracellular matrix components, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins in smcs and mmcs
mc phenotypes have been shown to depend on their interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrices  and neighboring cells  <cit> . one of the most remarkable findings in this study is the difference in gene expression of ecm protein components, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins, which may reflect functional adaptation of each type of mc to the mucosal or submucosal environment in the stomach . mmcs express genes for mucosa-specific ecm proteins such as muc <dig>  and tff <dig> , while smcs express genes for conventional ecm proteins such as col4a  and lama <dig> . moreover, smcs express genes for adhesion molecules such as alcam and vcam <dig>  and genes for ordinary cytoskeletal proteins such as acta <dig> , while mmcs express desmosome-component genes such as dsc <dig>  and dsg <dig> , and genes for keratin intermediate filaments such as krt <dig> and krt <dig>  desmosomes were reported to be present in the stomach epithelia  <cit> , and it was found that desmosome-like structures are detected in a particular type of mc  <cit> . it is thus possible that mmcs interact with adjacent epithelia through desmosomal adhesion in the stomach. in contrast, smcs appear to interact with neighboring cells via adhesion molecules such as vcam- <dig>  alcam and ve-cadherin . since these adhesion molecules have been shown to be involved in dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> , such molecule-mediated interactions with submucosal cells may be critical to maintain the functional and morphological properties of smcs. indeed, it should be noted that most smcs are variable in shape, and are often stretched and winding as compared with mmcs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we established a method of rna amplification from pooled intact mcs isolated from frozen tissue sections, which enables us to conveniently obtain the global gene expression pattern of mcs from various tissues, organs, and species including humans. by using this method, we demonstrated for the first time the distinct gene expression profiles of submucosal and mucosal mcs in the mouse stomach. our findings offer insight into possible unidentified properties specific for each mc subclass.
