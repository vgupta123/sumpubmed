BACKGROUND
ding proteins, named for the highly-conserved n-terminal sequence , were initially described as proteins from animal and plant tissues with molecular weights about 38– <dig> kda. the first ding protein was identified from human rheumatoid arthritis  synovial fluid as a lymphocyte stimulatory protein  <cit> . since then human ding proteins have been identified independently from urine and kidney stones as crystal adhesion inhibitors  <cit> ; in skin fibroblasts and cervical carcinoma cells using hirudin-agarose affinity columns  <cit> ; and in breast cells by their high affinity for genistein, an estrogen analog  <cit> . in these latter two cases, extracellular ding protein is linked to cell growth promotion by an autocrine or paracrine mechanism  <cit> . ding proteins have also been reported from other animals, e.g., turkey  and rat . ding proteins from several plant and fungal species are characterized by short n-terminal sequences and one has been shown capable of binding a germin-like protein in tobacco  <cit> . together these studies suggested that ding proteins are widespread in eukaryotes and play important roles in cell signaling and biomineralization.

although ding proteins have been frequently isolated or identified from eukaryotes on the basis of ligand-binding properties, no complete gene or protein sequences have been found in either the current eukaryotic genomes or est databases. recently, morales et al.  <cit>  reported the first complete amino acid sequence of a ding protein isolated from the human plasma high-density lipoprotein fraction, though no corresponding gene sequence has been identified. this ding protein was structurally characterized to be a phosphate binding protein, which is functionally related to solute binding proteins of the pst systems, the bacterial abc  transporters specific for phosphate  <cit> . the pst system is comprised of four components  <cit> : a periplasmic phosphate binding protein , two integral membrane domains  and a cytoplasmic atpase .

low-level homology between eukaryotic ding proteins and bacterial phosphate-binding proteins has been known for some time  <cit> . more recently, proteins with a greater degree of homology have been predicted in the sequenced genomes of pseudomonas  <cit> , including p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  <cit> . p. fluorescens sbw <dig> is a gram-negative plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium  representative of a group of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from the field-grown sugar beets at the university of oxford farm, wytham, oxford, in  <dig>  <cit> . the ding homologue of p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  named psp here for phosphate scavenging protein, shows 65–75% identity with the partial eukaryotic ding protein sequences and contains the highly conserved phosphate-binding site  <cit> . however, prediction of flanking genes in the psp locus was inaccurate when the analysis was based on raw sbw <dig> shotgun genome sequence data available at that time  <cit> . the coding region of psp of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> was previously cloned and expressed in escherichia coli and subsequent phosphate binding assays showed that the expressed sbw <dig> ding protein is able to bind inorganic phosphate  in vitro  <cit> . secondary and tertiary structure prediction and determination indicated a psts-like, "venus flytrap" structure  <cit> . a similar structure has been found for the human plasma phosphate binding protein  <cit> . previous study also showed that the ding protein was not detectable in sbw <dig> cells grown in luria-bertani  medium  <cit> , suggesting that psp was not constitutively expressed.

in this report we describe the genetic characterization of psp  encoding the ding protein of p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  we focus on the conditions under which psp is expressed and its role for bacterial growth in laboratory media and in the plant environment. our work begins with the complete but un-annotated whole genome sequence of sbw <dig>  based initially on this sequence, we perform an up-to-date comparison of gene sequences of the phosphate binding proteins in sbw <dig> and other genome-sequenced pseudomonas. we examine the functionalities of psp, together with the genes located upstream of psp  and genes in the pst locus, using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chromosomally integrated 'lacz fusions. the role of the ding protein in bacterial phosphate metabolism and plant colonization is discussed.

RESULTS
genomic analyses of putative phosphate-binding proteins in pseudomonas
the genome of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> harbors two putative phosphate-binding proteins, psp  and psts , which show 38% amino acid sequence similarity to each other. both psp and psts possess the highly conserved phosphate-binding sites  <cit> . however, psts is  <dig> amino acids shorter than psp and it does not contain the n-terminal dinggg residue.

psts is the first of six genes which are organized in the same orientation, suggesting that they are co-transcribed as an operon . genes encoding the other three components of the pst system  are located downstream of psts. the putative pst genes are organized by a gene order typical for abc transporters involved in substrate uptake: the periplasmic binding protein  first and then the membrane-spanning domains  and the atp-binding cassette .

psp is located  <dig> kb away from psts. orf pflu <dig>  downstream of psp, encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids, which contains a haemagglutination activity domain . this domain is typical of haemagglutinins, which are involved in bacterial adhesion to host cells  <cit> . immediately upstream of psp is a cluster of  <dig> genes that are predicted to encode an alternative type ii secretion system   <cit> . type ii-dependent exoproteins have an n-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved off during translocation to the periplasm by the sec or tat export system  <cit> . the folded or mature substrate protein is subsequently transported across the outer membrane by the type ii secretion apparatus. the discovery of hxc flanking psp led to a signal peptide analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of psp by using the signalp  <dig>  server  <cit> . results showed that psp does contain a signal peptide and the predicted cleavage site just before the characteristic dinggg residue . the fact that a type ii secretion system is present in the psp locus and that psp has a signal peptide led us to predict that psp is an extracellular protein secreted by the hxc system. this hypothesis was experimentally tested and described below.

comparative genomic analysis of putative phosphate-binding proteins between p. fluorescens sbw <dig> and other genome-sequenced pseudomonas showed that psts is ubiquitous whereas the ding protein is only present in two other species or strains . p. aeruginosa pao <dig> contains two ding-like proteins , of which the n-termini  show partial similarity to the dinggg residues. the lapab genes were previously shown to encode low-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatases  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  clearly, the ding proteins form a separate group from the ding-like  and the psts proteins, as already reported  <cit> , but they are much more diverse than previously anticipated.

the psp and pst operons are induced by pi limitation
to determine the conditions under which psp is expressed, a transcriptional 'lacz fusion was constructed to psp and the resulting fusion plasmid  was integrated into the genome of sbw <dig> by a single event of homologous recombination. the resulting psp-'lacz fusion strain  was subjected to a β-galactosidase assay using cells grown in both phosphate-rich  and phosphate-limited  medium. results  showed that psp expression was elevated  <dig> -fold at  <dig> hours and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> hours, in cells grown in pl compared to cells grown in pr medium.

a fold of increase for cells grown in pl medium versus pr medium is shown in parenthesis.

previous studies on transcription of pst genes from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and e. coli showed that the pst operon is expressed under pi limitation  <cit> . to test whether the predicted pst operon of sbw <dig> is induced by pi limitation, a pstc-'lacz fusion strain  was constructed and its expression was tested in a similar way as the psp-'lacz fusion strain. results  showed that pstc expression was significantly higher for cells grown in pl medium compared with cells grown in pr medium. compared to the levels of psp expression, the basic pstc expression and pi limitation-induced expression are very low .

next we carefully examined the promoter regions of psp and pst to search for putative pho box sequences. as shown in figure 1c, sequence motifs similar to the e. coli pho box consensus were identified upstream of the translational start site of psts and psp, suggesting that psp and pst operons are subjected to control by the conserved pho regulon  <cit> .

mutagenesis analysis of psp and pstc
having demonstrated that psp and pstc are induced by pi limitation, we next asked whether they are required for bacteria to grow in laboratory medium with limited pi and in the plant environment. to do this, two in-frame deletion mutants pbr <dig>  and pbr <dig>  were constructed by a standard procedure of allelic exchange. the two mutant strains showed similar growth curves with the wild-type when growing in complete medium , minimal medium  and phosphate media pr and pl .

to assess the growth more rigorously, we determined the competitive ability of each mutant relative to the wild type ancestor in two laboratory media . the mutant strain was mixed 1: <dig> with a lacz-marked "wild type" strain  and the bacterial mixture was inoculated into the tested media. after growing in competition for ~ <dig> generations in the laboratory media, the ratio of the mutant to the wild type competitor was determined on lb plus x-gal agar plates. results are shown in figure  <dig>  growth of pbr <dig>  was comparable to the wild-type in pr medium but was significantly impaired in pl medium. no fitness effect was observed with pbr <dig> .

the competitive ability of each mutant  relative to the lacz-marked "wild type" strain was also determined during a course of colonization of sugar beet seedlings. each mutant strain was inoculated, with the wild type in a 1: <dig> ratio, onto sugar beet seeds and recovered in two weeks from the shoots and rhizosphere on m <dig> plates supplemented with x-gal. results showed that the fitness of pbr <dig>  and pbr <dig>  was not significantly impaired in either the shoots or the rhizosphere .

psp is secreted by the hxc system
armed with knowledge that psp is expressed in pi limited medium, we next asked whether psp is an extracellular protein and furthermore whether it is secreted via the hxc system. an immunodiffusion experiment was performed between anti-ding antiserum and concentrated supernatants of sbw <dig>  cultures in pl and also in pr and lb broths . results showed that a precipitin line was formed only between anti-ding serum and pl supernatant . from this experiment we conclude that psp is an exoprotein, and its expression is induced by pi limitation, which is consistent with the β-galactosidase activity data described above and is further confirmed by the western blotting analysis described below.

to test whether psp secretion is dependent on the hxc system, an in-frame hxcr  deletion mutant was constructed by allelic exchange. hxcr encodes an essential component of the type ii secretion system , which provides energy for substrate translocation. concentrated supernatants and cell lysates of the mutant strain pbr <dig>  grown in pl medium were subjected to immunodiffusion analysis with an anti-ding antibody. wild-type sbw <dig> and pbr <dig>  were included and tested in parallel as the positive and negative control, respectively. figure 4a shows that psp is present in both supernatant and lysate of wild-type cells, but is not present in the lysate or supernatant from pbr <dig> . in pbr <dig> , psp is detectable at normal concentrations in the lysate, but is present at much lower concentrations in the supernatant, indicating that secretion is significantly reduced by the Δhxcr mutation.

this result was confirmed by western blot analysis of the same bacterial supernatants: only in pl medium was a  <dig> kda protein detectable with anti-ding antibodies . figure 4c showed that ding was detected as a strong band in the supernatant of the wild-type culture, but was totally absent in mutant pbr <dig> , and greatly reduced  in the pbr <dig>  supernatant. this western blot result indicates that the psp secretion is predominantly via the hxc system.

hxcr is not induced by pi limitation but shows elevated level of expression in planta
the in vivo expression technology  has been employed to identify sbw <dig> genes showing elevated levels of expression on the plant surfaces  <cit> . these plant inducible genes are of particular interest because they are predicted to play a role in the maximization of ecological performance in planta – a prediction confirmed for a locus encoding an acetylated cellulose polymer  <cit>  and cuea, a gene encoding the copper-transporting p-type atpase  <cit> .

central to this technique is a dapb deletion mutant strain , which is unable to grow in the absence of an exogenous source of dap  and lysine and, as a result, is unable to colonize sugar beet seedlings  <cit> . by fusing random fragments of the sbw <dig> genome to a promoterless copy of dapb it is possible to identify plant-inducible loci. arising from a genome-wide screen for plant-inducible loci from sbw <dig> was strain pil <dig>  which contains a fusion between hxcr and 'dapb  suggesting that the hxc locus is plant-induced.

experimental evidence described above showed that psp is induced by pi limitation, but the precise location of the psp promoter was unclear. hxcr and psp are organized in the same orientation. thus it is possible that psp is cotranscribed with hxcrs and induced also in the plant environment. to test this hypothesis, an ivet fusion  was constructed by cloning an  <dig> nt dna fragment from hxcs to psp into pivetd, and integrated into the genome by homogenous recombination. the resultant ivet fusion  was subjected to a plant colonization assay, together with the hxcr ivet fusion strain . about  <dig> cells were inoculated onto each sugar beet seed and bacteria were recovered from the shoots and rhizosphere, two weeks after plant sowing. results showed that the psp ivet fusion strain was not detected , whereas the hxcr fusion strains reach a cell density of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per shoot and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> per rhizosphere. both pil <dig> and pil082- <dig> are unable to grow in minimal medium  in the absence of lysine and dap. the ability of pil <dig> to grow on sugar beet seedlings but not on m <dig> medium confirmed that the promoter driving hxcr expression is active in the plant environment. the inability of pil082- <dig> to grow in planta indicates that psp is not induced in the plant environment.

to test whether hxcr is induced by pi limitation, expression of pil <dig> fusion was examined by measuring the β-galactosidase activities in cells grown in pr and pl media   <cit> . results showed that hxcr expression was not elevated in cells grown in pl medium  compared to cells grown in pr medium . taken together, the expression data  indicate that hxcr and psp are transcribed by different promoters. given that hxcr and hxcs are organized in a contiguous manner, the psp promoter is likely to be located in the intergenic region of hxcs and psp . this is consistent with the tentative identification of a putative pho box in this region .

discussion
phosphate is an essential but often limiting nutrient. multiple pi transport systems have evolved in bacteria to facilitate efficient uptake of pi from the environment. in e. coli, a constitutively-expressed, low-affinity transporter  is used in cells grown in environments with excess pi. under conditions of pi limitation, a high-affinity transport system  is induced and operates for pi scavenging  <cit> . in this report, we identified by in silico analysis genes encoding the pst transporter system in the sbw <dig> genome, whose function we experimentally tested. the pst system is an abc-type transporter that takes up pi from the periplasmic space of gram negative bacteria. psp, a protein secreted outside of the cell, may act to scavenge pi to the cell surface, where it can be subsequently taken up by the pst system. therefore, the psp and pst systems are very likely involved in phosphate acquisition in a cooperative manner. although psp is induced by limiting phosphate concentrations, its absence does not limit bacterial competitive growth under laboratory conditions, unlike pstc. the ding-like lap proteins may hydrolyze environmental organophosphates, following secretion, which is also consistent with a phosphate-scavenging role. it is noteworthy that psts sequences which are duplicated in some pseudomonas genomes may be significantly different, implying that there may also be functional variance within this sub-family of phosphate-binding proteins.

bacteria living in complex environments, e.g. plants and animals, utilize the type ii secretion pathway for extracellular release of particular proteins, such as toxins and hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> . two functionally independent type ii secretion systems  have been described in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . interestingly, in addition to the xcp and hxc homologues, the p. fluorescens sbw <dig> genome harbors an additional copy of the type ii gene cluster . here we showed that the ding protein secretion was greatly reduced in the hxcr mutant pbr <dig> , suggesting that there may be some functional redundancy amongst the three type ii secretion systems.

psp is regulated by pi limitation but its expression is not elevated in the plant environment, indicating that pi is not depleted in our plant growth system. on the contrary, hxcr is not induced by pi limitation but shows elevated levels of expression in sugar beet seedlings. while the result implicates important roles of the hxc secretion system in bacterium-plant interaction, like most plant-inducible genes  <cit> , the signals that induce hxcr expression in planta are currently unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
proteins belonging to the ding family have very poorly defined physiological roles. functional investigation of eukaryotic ding proteins is hindered by the unavailability of full amino acid sequences in most cases and by the absence of full gene sequences in the eukaryotic genome and est databases. insight into the function and gene regulation of the prokaryotic members of ding protein family may provide valuable cues as to the functions of the ding proteins in general. a previous study showed that psp from p. fluorescens sbw <dig> is capable of binding pi in vitro  <cit> . in this report we demonstrated in p. fluorescens sbw <dig> that psp is expressed under pi limitation and is an exoprotein, secretion of which is mainly dependent on the alternative type ii secretion system . interestingly, expression of the hxc system is elevated on plant surfaces, which is first reported here. moreover, the pst pi transporter system was predicted in the sbw <dig> genome and its function was experimentally characterized in parallel to psp. results show that pst is induced by phosphate limitation and it is required for bacterial competitive growth in phosphate limiting medium. taken together, the data implicate functional roles of psp in bacterial phosphate metabolism. psp and pst could form an efficient phosphate scavenging system, which contributes to physiological adaptation to phosphate limited environments.
