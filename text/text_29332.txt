BACKGROUND
the ysl is an extra-embryonic structure and it forms at the stage of mid-blastula transition  in teleosts  <cit>  by a poorly understood developmental mechanism. the ysl performs several early developmental functions such as yolk metabolism, nutrient transport  <cit> , utilization of maternally stored morphogenetic substances including retinoids  <cit> , and epiboly movement  <cit> . it also plays a morphogenetic role during gastrulation in induction and patterning of mesoderm, endoderm and dorsal structures  <cit> . however, there is little information on the function of the ysl after epiboly is completed. recently it has been reported that the ysl-specific factor mtx <dig> plays a role in migration of myocardial precursor cells and knockdown of mtx <dig> in the ysl resulted in cardia bifida and duplication of liver and pancreatic buds. based on these results it has been proposed that the ysl regulates migration of endodermal cells  <cit> .

rbp <dig> is produced in the adult liver and functions as a specific transporter of retinol in vertebrate plasma. expression of rbp <dig> has been studied in several model animals. during embryonic development of rodents it is expressed only in the visceral extra-embryonic endoderm of the yolk sac, suggesting that rbp <dig> may play roles in mediating retinol transfer from maternal blood to the developing fetus  <cit> . similar expression has also been reported in chick  <cit> . in zebrafish, rbp <dig> has been reported to be expressed in the ysl, hypochord and skin  <cit> . it is of interest to analyse the role of rbp <dig> in zebrafish development.

the liver is an important endodermal organ, which exerts both endocrine and exocrine functions. many studies have revealed that the molecular mechanisms of liver development are conserved in vertebrates  <cit> . furthermore, cell fate mapping experiments in zebrafish, frog and mouse have also indicated that the liver arises, at least in part, from different groups of endodermal cells found initially in bilateral regions on both sides of the midline  <cit> . despite this progress the mechanism of liver bud formation in zebrafish is not fully understood. according to one hypothesis based to a large extent on observations of gutgfp transgenic zebrafish, the early endoderm forms as an endodermal rod, which starts to bud and gives rise to several primordia including the liver primordium which grows mainly due to cell proliferation within the primordium  <cit> . a conflicting view based on analysis of different molecular markers implies that whereas the digestive anlagen of amniotes arise from a primitive gut tube, the zebrafish digestive system is assembled from individual organ anlage  <cit> . in addition, based on analysis of the expression pattern of ceruloplasmin in wild type and mutant zebrafish, migration of progenitor cells from posterior to anterior and towards the midline has been proposed to take place during formation of the liver  <cit> . recently, this hypothesis has been supported by discovery of the posterior-to-anterior migration of cells between the enveloping layer  and ysl, which is linked to the formation of the yolk cell extension .

in this study, we demonstrated that early expression of rbp <dig> in the ysl is restricted only to the ventro-lateral ysl. rbp <dig> expression is negatively controlled by nodal and hh signalling pathways and positively regulated by ra. the ysl-specific knockdown of rbp <dig> caused inhibition of the yce formation and formation of two liver buds. thus, rbp <dig> probably plays a role in morphogenesis of the yolk cell and formation of the liver bud.

RESULTS
expression of rbp <dig> mrnas
the est clone coding for rbp <dig>  from our collection  <cit>  was selected and sequenced completely. the complete sequence was submitted to genbank  and it was almost identical  to a sequence previously available . to investigate the temporal expression pattern of rbp <dig> in early development, rbp <dig> transcripts were analyzed by rt-pcr from fertilized eggs to  <dig> hpf. we found that rbp <dig> transcripts were of maternal origin and the zygotic expression of rbp <dig> increased from  <dig> hpf to reach its peak by  <dig> hpf .

to further investigate the pattern of rbp <dig> expression in zebrafish embryos, whole mount in situ hybridization  was carried out. transcripts of rbp <dig> were detected from  <dig> hpf on the yolk surface anterior to the head. this expression domain was confined to the ventro-lateral yolk cell . at  <dig> hpf, rbp <dig> expression increased and expanded posteriorly but remained confined to the ventro-lateral yolk cell . to define this expression domain in detail, two-colour wish using ctsl  and rbp <dig> probes was performed at  <dig> hpf. ctsl was expressed in the hatching gland mesoderm around the head as expected, while the anterior end of the rbp <dig> expression domain was found to spread under the head . a cross section indicated that ctsl and rbp <dig> were expressed in different layers of tissue . dapi staining clearly revealed that the enlarged nuclei, characteristic of the ysl, were surrounded by rbp <dig> transcripts , while the superficial cellular layer or the enveloping layer was free of rbp <dig> transcripts. thus, the expression of rbp <dig> on the surface of the yolk cell was probably confined to the ysl. to the best of our knowledge this is the first molecular marker of the ventro-lateral ysl.

at  <dig> hpf, rbp <dig> expression in the ysl is restricted to its posterior part including that in the yce . this expression pattern remained unchanged at least until  <dig> hpf . later the expression spread anteriorly but remained excluded from the pericardium . by  <dig> dpf, rbp <dig> expression was detected in the liver . by  <dig> dpf the liver became the only tissue with detectable rbp <dig> expression .

to understand the developmental mechanism controlling the unusual spatial expression pattern of rbp <dig> in the ysl, the expression pattern of this gene in several mutants affecting various aspects of early endoderm development was analyzed. in mutants affecting nodal signalling  , rbp <dig> expression expanded anteriorly and covered the whole yolk. similar changes of expression pattern were also observed in mutants that affected components of the hh signalling pathway, smu , syu  and yot . as the restricted expression pattern of rbp <dig> was lost at  <dig> hpf in these mutants, it is likely that the early expression pattern of rbp <dig> in the ysl is under negative regulation of the nodal and hedgehog signaling pathways, which prevent the rbp <dig> expression in the anterior and dorsal ysl.

in the mibtfi <dig> mutant which has a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding e <dig> ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiqutination of delta, a ligand of notch signaling, delta is up-regulated causing premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells  <cit> . the restricted rbp <dig> expression pattern in the ysl was maintained, but the expression in the liver appeared much earlier than that in control embryos . in addition, the rbp <dig> expression in the liver of mibtfi91-/+ heterozygotes also appeared prematurely but the expression domain was smaller than that in mibtfi91-/- homozygotes . further analysis of another allele of mib mutant, mibta52b, demonstrated that the expression domain of rbp <dig> in the liver is larger in the mibta52b allele  than that in the mibtfi <dig> allele. this is in accordance with the fact that mibta52b-/- allele is a stronger dominant negative mutation, while the mibtfi91-/- allele is a weaker null allele  <cit> .

analyses of embryos of two mutant lines with defects in formation of axial mesoderm, spt and ntl, did not show obvious changes in expression pattern of rbp <dig> from  <dig> hpf to  <dig> hpf, suggesting that the formation of axial mesoderm probably does not influence events involving rbp <dig> in the ysl .

ra positively regulates rbp <dig> expression in the ysl
retinol is the precursor of ra, which plays important roles in many aspects of development  <cit> . in order to examine whether ra could regulate rbp <dig> expression, different doses of ra and deab , an inhibitor of ra synthesis acting through inhibition of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit> , were applied to wild type embryos starting from  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, respectively. control embryos were soaked in  <dig> % dmso/egg water. wish on  <dig> hpf embryos with the rbp <dig> probe showed that in all cases ra treatment caused expansion of rbp <dig> expression . in contrast, deab treatment caused reduction of rbp <dig> expression . thus, ra positively regulates rbp <dig> expression in the ysl. it is interesting to note that the phenotypes were more severe when the treatment was initiated early. in the ra treatment group, rbp <dig> expression was generally stronger in embryos treated from  <dig> hpf  than that from  <dig> hpf . in the deab treatment group, the yolk extension was affected more severely when the treatment was started from  <dig> hpf than from  <dig> hpf. the embryos treated from  <dig> hpf showed no yolk extension  or a very short one, whereas the embryos treated from  <dig> hpf showed only mild shortening of the yolk extension .

functional analysis of rbp <dig> in zebrafish by morpholino knockdown
to study the role of rbp <dig> during early development, the morpholino knockdown technique was employed  <cit> . since the initial expression of rbp <dig> occurs in the ysl, we first focused on a role of this gene in this structure. for this purpose we used the ysl-targeted injection of anti-rbp <dig> morpholino  . two anti-rbp <dig> mos were designed, one for translation blocking by targeting the 5'-atg area  and the other to block splicing by targeting the junction of the 2nd exon and 2nd intron . after injection of the atg-mo, the morphants developed relatively normally at least until  <dig> hpf, but approximately 20% of injected embryos developed a shorter yce and much larger yolk cell . furthermore, the whole yolk cell of morphants became abnormally dark at 4– <dig> dpf and they died soon after. injection of spl-mo generated morphants with this phenotype more efficiently and in a dose-dependant manner . at a low dose , the yce in  <dig> % of morphants was shorter than that in controls. at a medium dose ,  <dig> % of morphants displayed abnormal yce:  <dig> % featured short yce and  <dig> % lacked it completely . at a high dose ,  <dig> % of morphants were affected and the fraction lacking yce increased to  <dig> %. to verify the specificity of spl-mo, a  <dig> nucleotide mismatched morpholino  was also synthesized and tested, and there was no noticeable change in the yce .

rt-pcr was used to validate the specificity of spl-mo. two sets of primers were designed to monitor the splicing of rbp <dig> transcript: f <dig>  + r <dig> ; f <dig> +r <dig> . when pcr extension time was set at  <dig>  minute, f <dig> +r <dig> would only amplify the unspliced transcripts and no genomic dna would be amplified due to presence of the large 4th intron . similarly, primers f1+r <dig> would amplify only the correctly spliced rbp <dig> transcripts but not genomic dna or unspliced rbp <dig> template. as shown in figure 3h, correctly spliced rbp <dig> transcripts were reduced and the unspliced transcripts were present in  <dig> hpf morphants . sequence analysis also confirmed that the pcr fragment contained the unspliced intron . protein sequence prediction from the unspliced transcript showed a premature stop codon after  <dig> amino acid residues. as a result, the unspliced transcript encoded only the signal peptide. furthermore, rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> hpf uninjected control and mis-mo injected embryos using the same pairs of primers as for the spl-mo. as shown in fig 3h, the level of correctly spliced rbp <dig> transcripts in the mis-mo injected embryos was similar to that of control while unspliced transcripts were not detectable in the mis-mo injected embryos. thus, these experimental data demonstrated that the anti-rbp <dig> spl-mo efficiently blocked the processing of rbp <dig> mrna.

liver development in rbp <dig> morphants
to study the developmental changes in the morphants, several markers expressed in the ysl and endodermal organs were employed. the liver marker transferrin  <cit>  indicated two liver buds on both sides of the body axis in embryos injected with either atg-mo or spl-mo injection, but not in mis-mo injected embryos . compared with  <dig> % of atg-mo morphants with two liver buds, a much higher percentage  of spl-mo morphants showed this phenotype . the two liver buds were either connected with each other or separated . this phenotype also appeared in a dose-dependant manner; the high dose of spl-mo caused an increase in a number of morphants with separated liver buds . duplication of liver or other unpaired visceral organs such as pancreas, heart and interrenal gland have been previously observed in mutants with defective midline formation  <cit> . in order to examine whether the phenomenon of duplicated liver in rbp <dig> morphants was also due to midline defects, several midline markers were evaluated in the morphants at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. shh ,no tail and twhh were expressed normally suggesting that formation of the notochord and floor plate was not affected. therefore the duplication of the liver bud in rbp <dig> morphants is not related to defects in midline formation. to further analyze liver morphology, cross-section of  <dig> hpf morphants was performed. from anterior to posterior, the two liver buds contain several layers of cells similar to that in control . thus it seems that the two liver buds undergo at least initial stages of hepatogenesis. at the same time, these sections also showed that the gut was normal. in contrast to the ysl-injection, injection of morpholino at 1-cell stage resulted in a lower percentage of the duplicated liver phenotype . in addition, defects in the brain and tail were observed , indicating rbp <dig> may have other functions during development. while this study focused on a role of rbp <dig> during liver development, other functions of rbp <dig> will be analyzed in future.

to analyze development of pancreas, the tg that expresses gfp in insulin-producing endocrine pancreatic cells  <cit>  as well as molecular markers for the exocrine  and endocrine  pancreas were used. in both rbp <dig> morphants and controls, gfp-positive endocrine β-cells were found on the right side of the midline . similarly, the sst2-positive endocrine cells and elaa-positive exocrine cells were found in the same position . thus, rbp <dig> knockdown causes duplication of the liver but not the pancreas. this suggests that rbp <dig> probably plays a role only in early liver development. in addition, we never noticed heart duplication in rbp <dig> morphants; this observation was further supported by the fact that the expression of gata <dig>  an early endoderm and heart marker  <cit> , was not affected at  <dig> hpf .

migration of endodermal cells towards the midline has been implicated in formation of several visceral organs, including the liver, pancreas, interrenal gland and heart  <cit> . therefore several early endodermal markers were analyzed in morphants. among these, foxa <dig> is a pan-endodermal marker and is expressed in several endodermal organs including the liver during pharyngula period  <cit> . as shown in figure 5d compared to figure 5a control, there was no altered foxa <dig> expression in rbp <dig> morphants at  <dig> hpf, indicating that the early convergence of anterior endoderm was not affected by knockdown of rbp <dig>  however, at  <dig> hpf when there was a major increase of rbp <dig> mrna in the ysl, in addition to its normal expression in the hatching gland and tail bud  <cit> , foxa <dig> expression in the morphant was observed on the ventro-lateral yolk surface in the morphant  but not in the control embryos . interestingly, this ectopic foxa <dig> expression was detected mainly anteriorly. at later stage, duplicated expression domains in the liver bud regions were observed in the morphant  but not in the control . the ysl and lateral plate mesodermal marker hhex  <cit>  was also used in the study, but there was no obvious alteration of its expression pattern was noticed in rbp <dig> morphants . thus, there is no evidence that a defect in endoderm or lateral plate mesoderm caused formation of the two liver buds in the morphants.

to examine the role of rbp <dig> in hepatocyte migration, another early endoderm and hepatocyte marker prox <dig> was used. the homeobox gene prox <dig> is an early marker for the developing liver and pancreas of several vertebrates, including zebrafish, and plays a role in migration of hepatocytes during early liver development of mammals  <cit> . at  <dig> hpf, a small dot of prox <dig> expression on the left side of the control embryo defined the liver bud, however, in morphants of the same stage, in addition to the prox <dig> expression in the liver bud on the left side, a line-shaped prox <dig> expression domain was found on the right side and it appeared to cross the midline to the left side . such morphological changes in appearance of endodermal cells have been interpreted as evidence of delayed migration of these cells  <cit> . in control embryos, the liver bud is located at the a-p level of somites 1– <dig>  the line-shaped prox <dig> staining in morphants was found at the same a-p level. cross-sections of morphants showed that the prox1-positive cells are indeed in the position of the liver bud just above the yolk, but the morphant liver bud is flatter . based on our current observations, it is likely that early hepatocyte precursor cells migrate into the liver bud and these cells are likely of endodermal origin as they expressed foxa <dig> and prox <dig> endoderm markers. the ysl expression of rbp <dig> appears to be necessary for the migration, which likely occurred from  <dig> hpf when rbp <dig> expression was largely increased  until 25– <dig> hpf when liver bud formation is completed .

previously it has been reported that the ysl-specific transcription factor mtx <dig> regulates myocardial cell migration through downregulation of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin <dig>   <cit> . to investigate whether the fn <dig> is involved in hepatocyte migration in the rbp <dig> pathway, we examined fn <dig> expression in rbp <dig> morphants. as shown in figure 5k–n, fn <dig> was downregulated in the ventro-lateral yolk where rbp <dig> is normally expressed. interestingly, fn <dig> expression in the myocardial precursor region was not affected in the rbp <dig> morphants; consistent with this, no cardiac bifida was observed in the morphants. thus fn <dig> in the ventro-lateral yolk may be specifically involved in yolk extension formation and/or hepatocyte migration.

discussion
rbp <dig> is a plasma protein acting as a transporter of retinol in blood circulation. during early development rbp <dig> is expressed in the ysl of zebrafish . because of peculiarities of embryonic development in fish and mammals, direct comparison of the ysl to the extraembryonic structures in mammals is difficult, but comparison of expression of developmental genes may help to solve this puzzle. rbp <dig> is expressed in the extra-embryonic endoderm of the yolk sac during embryonic development of the rat, mouse and chick  <cit> . interestingly, zebrafish rbp <dig> is expressed in the ysl on the surface of the yolk cell , which, like the yolk sac in mammals, acts as a depot of maternal retinoids in zebrafish  <cit> . these observations suggest functional similarity of these extraembryonic structures in mammals and fish. further, as suggested by thomas et al.  <cit> , the ysl plays an important role in early embryonic patterning similar to that of the anterior visceral endoderm  in mouse embryos  <cit> . consistent with this, some murine genes homologous to xenopus genes important in the organizer  are also expressed in the ave  <cit> ; interestingly, the zebrafish hhex is also expressed in the dorsal ysl in zebrafish during gastrula stage  <cit> .

several early developmental genes, including sqt, cas and gata <dig>  are expressed both in the ysl and adjacent vegetal blastomeres  <cit> , but the specific roles of these genes in the ysl remain unknown since it is difficult to uncouple these functions from those in the marginal blastoderm. now it is possible to target the ysl by injecting materials into the ysl only. it has been demonstrated that injections of rnase into the ysl effectively eliminates ysl transcripts without affecting ubiquitously expressed genes in the blastoderm  <cit> . by this approach, important information about early function of ysl in the formation of ventro-lateral mesoderm and induction of nodal-related genes in the ventro-lateral marginal blastomeres has been obtained  <cit> .

however, the specific function of genes expressed in the late ysl remains largely unknown. while a number of genes are expressed in the ysl ubiquitously , zangptl <dig> is probably the only one with restricted posterior expression pattern in the ysl  <cit> . our current work on zebrafish rbp <dig> expression in the ysl provides another example illustrating patterning of the ysl. this non-uniform expression pattern suggests that at this stage the ysl could be patterned along the a-p and d-v axes. consistent with this idea, the distinct morphogenetic domains in the ysl have been reported previously based on migration of its nuclei, though the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown  <cit> . the restricted expression of rbp <dig> in the ysl opens a question about mechanisms of such restriction, which we answered to some extent by demonstrating that the nodal and hh signalling pathways  <cit>  negatively control expression of rbp <dig> similar to that of ceruloplasmin  <cit> . at the same time, ra seems to positively regulate expression of rbp <dig> in the ysl.

the effects of these signalling pathways on liver development require further experimental efforts. in our preliminary experiments, we noticed that both ra and deab led to no liver when the treatment was performed before but not after  <dig> hpf . although ra signalling could regulate rbp <dig> expression, it is difficult to conclude the involvement of rbp <dig> in the ra signalling in regulation of liver development because of the pleitropic effect of ra. nodal and hh signalling pathways have been reported to play important roles in zebrafish endoderm development  <cit> . in our preliminary analyses using the nodal and hh mutants, most of them  showed either smaller or no liver . only sqt-/- showed duplicated liver formation, which is probably due to its midline defect  <cit>  as reported for another midline defect mutant flh-/-  <cit> . however, liver bud duplication in rbp <dig> morphant is unlikely due to the midline defect because the midline structure was remained normal in the rbp <dig> morphant .

while it is widely accepted that the ysl plays a leading role during epiboly  <cit> , little information is available about the function of ysl after epiboly. it is not known whether the ysl at this stage influences the overlying cells just like that during early gastrulation or, alternatively, the embryo proper influences the patterning of the extraembryonic structures including the ysl. we discovered at least two different functions of rbp <dig> within the ysl. first, rbp <dig> deficiency results in abnormality of the yce. interestingly, rbp <dig> starts to be expressed in the ysl a few hours before the formation of yce. while the exact molecular mechanism behind the yce formation is not known, it has been suggested that the yce formation is influenced by the posterior to anterior migration of cells between the yolk and evl. these cells accumulate at the level of yce and could be responsible for yce formation  <cit> .

second, rbp <dig> is involved in the formation of the liver bud. as rbp <dig> is not expressed in the endoderm during this process, its contribution is probably indirect through its role in the ysl. during organogenesis different cell lineages migrate to establish anlage of various organs and differentiate thereafter. recently it has been reported that the ysl-specific factor mtx <dig> plays a role in migration of myocardial precursor cells and posterior endoderm, as knockdown of mtx <dig> in the ysl results in cardia bifida due to a failure of myocardial cells to migrate to the midline. in parallel, 30% of mtx <dig> morphants developed duplicated hepatic and pancreatic buds  <cit> . moreover, duplication of liver bud has been also observed in other studies. ober et al  <cit>  have reported that vegfc is required for coalescence of anterior endoderm to the midline and knockdown of vegfc results in formation of a forked gut tube and duplicated buds of liver and pancreas. similarly, matsui et al  <cit>  have also reported a new role of non-canonical wnt signalling during migration of precursor cells toward the midline. the down-regulation of wnt/dvl/rhoa signalling leads to the failure of fusion of the anterior gut tube and formation of duplicated livers and pancreas; in addition, migration of myocardial precursors toward the midline is also affected. in contrast to these observations, knockdown of rbp <dig> has no effects on migration of heart precursors and the formation of the gut and pancreatic bud. instead, the deficiency of rbp <dig> causes a more limited effect resulting in formation of duplicated liver buds only. consistent with this, we observed in the rbp <dig> morphants that the cell migration molecule fn <dig> is specifically reduced in the ventro-lateral region of the yolk, where the rbp <dig> is normally expressed, but not in the myocardia progenitors; meanwhile, the ectopic expression of foxa <dig> appears specifically in the ventro-lateral region of the yolk. the ventro-lateral increase of foxa <dig> and decrease of fn <dig> suggested that the cells above the rbp4-expressing ysl are probable hepatocyte progenitors which will migrate from the ventro-lateral yolk toward the midline depending on a rbp4-fn <dig> signalling pathway. thus, the effect of rbp <dig> is limited probably only to hepatocyte progenitors.

recently, two conflicting hypotheses of organogenesis of zebrafish visceral organs have been proposed. one emphasizes the formation of the endodermal rod by migration of endodermal cells towards the midline and budding of all major endodermal organs from the rod  while the other puts more weight on the establishment of independent primordia of these organs and their later assembly  <cit> . based on the data available, we suggest a unified theory of formation of endodermal organs; i.e. following the formation of the endodermal rod through convergence of the endodermal cells at the midline and the budding of organ primordia, there is continued cell migration from posterior to anterior and from lateral to medial, adding more cells to the buds of organs. previously, based on analysis of expression pattern of ceruloplasmin in the wild type and mutant zebrafish, migration of liver progenitors from both sides of the yolk cell to the midline has been postulated during formation of the liver bud and a role of midline signaling in this process has been illustrated  <cit> . migration of liver progenitors is probably a part of a more general process of migration of endodermal cells that contributes also to organogenesis of the pancreas, interrenal gland and heart  <cit> . thus cell migration during the late phase of formation of visceral organs seems to be rather common in zebrafish. similarly, it has been shown in mice by cell fate mapping that there are different groups of liver precursor cells which migrate to form the liver bud  <cit> . our analysis of rbp <dig> morphants demonstrated that on the surface of the yolk there are two spatially separated populations of liver precursor cells found on both sides of the midline as proposed earlier  <cit> . it seems that these cells require an input from the ysl for proper migration. in the present study, we demonstrated that the ysl-expressed rbp <dig> is necessary for migration of liver progenitors towards the midline and formation of a single liver bud.

rbp <dig> is the extracellular transporter of retinol, a precursor of ra that has been implicated in regulation of cell migration as a stimulator and as an inhibitor of this process depending on the cellular context  <cit> . it stimulates neuronal migration in the zebrafish hindbrain  <cit> . in view of these earlier observations, our current data suggest that retinoids could play a role in regulating migration of early hepatic cells during the process of liver formation. given the fact that during the course of our analysis we only evaluated molecular markers and morphology of the heart, pancreas and liver, retinoids could be involved in regulation of cell migration during formation of some other visceral organs that were not analysed here. the developmental roles of rbp <dig> in zebrafish revealed in this study should also be considered within a much more general context of metabolism of retinoids in extraembryonic structures that seems to be evolutionarily conserved in all vertebrates studied so far.

CONCLUSIONS
rbp <dig> is traditionally considered to function as a retinol binding protein of the serum. here we showed that during embryogenesis rbp <dig> mrna was expressed only in the ventro-lateral ysl and later this expression expanded to cover the posterior ysl in early zebrafish embryos. rbp <dig> expression was negatively regulated by nodal and hh signalling and positively controlled by ra. this restricted expression pattern suggested that despite being a syncytium the ysl is patterned. later rbp <dig> was expressed in the liver. knockdown of rbp <dig> in the ysl resulted in shortened yolk extension as well as the formation of two liver buds, which could be due to impaired migration of liver precursor cells. in contrast, exocrine and endocrine pancreas, intestine and heart developed normally in rbp <dig> morphants. thus we suggest that rbp <dig> expression in the ysl is required only for liver development.
